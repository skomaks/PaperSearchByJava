It is important to develop desirable piezo-/ferroelectric nanostructures to realize the full potential of polarization-modulated built-in electric fields that can effectively separate excited electron/hole pairs. In this work, taking KNbO3 as a representative material, we show that two-dimensional nanosheets exhibit greatly improved piezo-photocatalytic degradation efficiency for organic dyes compared to that of nanocubes. In addition, effective tuning of the PEC water splitting property by manipulating the ferroelectric polarization was observed in these KNbO3 nanostructures, demonstrating versatile and tuneable devices for solar energy conversion. By changing the poling configuration, a significant photocurrent density enhancement of 55% was achieved for KNbO3 nanosheets, which is much greater than the 25% enhancement observed for the nanocube counterparts. These results could be attributed to the larger piezo-/ferroelectric response in the nanosheets as determined by piezoresponse force microscopy analysis and piezoelectric potential simulation based on the finite element method. Our findings may provide insights into strategies for designing highly efficient piezo-/ferroelectric nanomaterials for solar energy conversion."

      "text" : "Semiconductor photocatalysis technology, which can directly convert solar energy into chemical energy, is considered as one of the most promising routes to address the current challenges of environmental remediation and increasing energy demands. Nevertheless, the conversion efficiency of photocatalyst has often been limited by poor light absorption, inefficient charge separation and diffusion, as well as unsatisfactory photostability [1,2]. To overcome these challenges, strategies such as doping, co-catalyst loading, nanostructure design, and\nsurface protection have been explored to ameliorate the drawbacks of the currently developed photocatalytsts and photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells [3–8]. Nevertheless, the possible improvement of the conversion efficiencies by these methods is limited to a certain extent because of the restrictions imposed by the chemical synthesis techniques and material feasibility.\nFor charge separation and transportation, piezophototronic and ferroelectric polarization effects offer a promising route to overcome the bottleneck [9–11]. Under light illumination, the separation/recombination and transport of the photogenerated electron/hole pairs\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.095 Received 29 July 2018; Received in revised form 13 January 2019; Accepted 31 January 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author at: School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Soil and Groundwater Pollution Control, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China.\n⁎⁎ Corresponding author.

Meanwhile, it has been reported that the electric field generated by separation of photo-carrier can also lead to switching of polarization [17]. These intriguing effects triggered the renewed interest in the use of piezo-/ferroelectrics for solar energy conversion in the past two decades. On the one hand, inspired by the first proposal of piezo-electrochemical effect in 2010 by Hong et al. [18], extensive research have been devoted to developing various types of piezoelectric nanomaterials, including ZnO [19], BaTiO3 [20], Pb (Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) [21], Bi4Ti3O12 [22], MoS2 [23], and nanocomposites, such as ZnO/TiO2 [24] and MoS2/PDMS [25], to promote photocatalytic/electrochemical reactions through a combination of mechanical and solar energy. In particular, Li et al. realized an ultrasonic-wave-driven piezophototronic process by combining the piezoelectric effect with photoelectric conversion in Ag2O/BaTiO3 hybrid structure [26]. On the other hand, ferroelectrics with spontaneous and reversible polarization can create a depolarization electric field that\nextends throughout the entire volume of the material, providing a driving force for effective separation of the photogenerated charges [27–29]. Moreover, this internal electrical field also gives rise to the modulation of the chemical potential and surface band bending that play key roles in determining the charge transport behaviours and surface catalytic reactions [30–32]. Due to these fascinating features, ferroelectric metal oxides have been intensively studied either as the sole harvesting material, such as (K, Na)NbO3 [33], LiNbO3 [34], BiFeO3 [35,36] and Bi2FeCrO6 [37], or in hybrid systems [38–45], as exemplified by epitaxial TiO2/PbTiO3 nanoplates [39] and Ag/BiFeO3 thin film photoelectrodes [46], which had greatly enhanced photocatalytic or PEC activities through the appropriate manipulation of the ferroelectric polarization.\nBoth theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the size, shape and crystal orientation play important roles in the piezo-/ferroelectric properties [47–52]. It is generally believed that the piezopotential of nanostructured piezoelectric materials is larger than that of the bulk counterparts due to their property of easy deformation. For instance, Jiang et al. theoretically presented that the piezopotential significantly increases with the inverse of the GaN nanocrystal size or\nthe shape factor [50]. In addition, low-dimensional ferroelectrics also show unique properties resulting from the strong nanoscale confinement effect and the formation of single domains [53–55]. To date, however, only a few attempts have been made to elucidate the influence of the size, shape and crystal orientation of piezo-/ferroelectric nanostructures on their piezo-catalytic and polarization-controlled PEC properties [20,23,42,56]. Yang et al. demonstrated that the thickness of ferroelectric BaTiO3 layer has a strong impact on the PEC performance in TiO2/BaTiO3 core/shell nanowire photoanodes [42]. Wu and coworkers reported an ultrahigh piezo-catalytic activity in few-layered MoS2 nanoflowers [23]. Very recently, a remarkably enhanced piezocatalytic property was observed in BaTiO3 nanowires, which can be attributed to the large piezoelectric potential along the polar axis [20]. In spite of these advantages, fundamental understanding is still lacking and further studies are necessary for developing desirable nanostructures that can fully utilize the polarization-modulated built-in electric fields towards highly efficient photocatalysts and PEC cells.\nIn this work, potassium niobate (KNbO3), a classic piezo-/ferroelectric perovskite oxide with a suitable band position and excellent chemical stability [57–59] was chosen as a model material. Single-crystalline KNbO3 nanosheets (NS) and nanocubes (NC) were synthesized and their piezo-photocatalytic and ferroelectric polarization-engineered PEC activities were studied. The results were supported by both piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) investigation [60] and piezoelectric potential simulation with the finite element method (FEM)."

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained using a FEI Talos F200X electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.

      "text" : "The crystalline structure of the samples was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, the diffraction peaks of both samples can be well-indexed to the orthorhombic KNbO3 structure (JCPDS No. 32–0822, space group Amm2). No peaks from other phases were observed, indicating the high purity of the as-synthesized KNbO3 nanostructures. The morphological features were characterized by SEM and TEM (Fig. S1). The lateral size and thickness of the KNbO3 NS range from 0.5 to 1.6 µm and from 40 to 60 nm, respectively, and the edge length of the NC is between 200 nm and 1 µm. The corresponding SAED patterns prove the single crystalline nature of the KNbO3 NS and NC (insets of Fig. 1d and g). The crystal structure of the samples was further investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The lattice fringe spacings for a typical NS (Fig. 1e) were measured as 0.286 and 0.396 nm, corresponding to the (200) and (001) planes of orthorhombic KNbO3, respectively. An individual NC shows lattice parameters in the orthorhombic phase of the (110) and (001) planes with lattice spacings of 0.403 nm and 0.396 nm, respectively. Based on the above analysis, the crystal orientations of the KNbO3 NS and NC were depicted in Fig. 1f and i, respectively. The spontaneous polarization (P) of KNbO3 is along the [110] direction in the orthorhombic phase (Amm2 symmetry) [62] (Fig. 1c). Therefore, we can conclude that the NS has two polarization\ncomponents that are perpendicular and parallel to each of the exposed surfaces and that the polarization direction of the NC is perpendicular to one side of the cube.\nFurthermore, Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the lattice perturbations in the local structure of the different KNbO3 samples (Fig. 2a). Both the NS and NC samples show the typical vibration modes of orthorhombic KNbO3 [61,63], where ν5 is ascribed to the vibration of the Nb ions against the oxygen octahedra (280 cm−1), ν2 (532 cm−1) and ν1 (601 cm−1) represent the O–Nb–O stretching vibration, and the weak peak at 831 cm−1 corresponds to the combination band of ν1 and ν5. It is clearly observed that the KNbO3 NS and NC have very similar Raman spectra, indicating that the local structural differences between these samples are negligible.\nThe chemical states of the samples were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as displayed in Fig. 2b. XPS survey scan spectrum of the KNbO3 NS exhibits distinct K 2p, Nb 3d, O 1 s and C 1s core level peaks, and no additional peaks were observed. The binding energies for Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 are located at 206.2 and 208.9 eV, respectively, in good agreement with those of pure KNbO3 obtained in previous works [57]. The two peaks centred at 291.0 eV and 293.6 eV are attributed to the K 2p3/2 and K 2p1/2 states, respectively, indicating that potassium is in the K+ state. The binding energy of O 1s is located at about 529.2 eV. For comparison, the XPS spectra of the KNbO3 NC sample were also obtained (Fig. S2). The K 2p and Nb 3d peaks are very similar with that of the KNbO3 NS. Different from the NS sample, OC (531.4 eV) component associated with OH– species was observed for the KNbO3 NC. This should be due to the post-annealing treatment on the KNbO3 NS.\nUV–vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) were measured to investigate the optical properties of the samples (Fig. 2c). The KNbO3 NS and NC have similar absorption edges, whereas the NC shows a\nslightly higher UV absorption intensity than the NS. The optical band gaps of the KNbO3 NS and NC were estimated to be approximately 3.07 and 3.02 eV (inset of Fig. 2c), respectively, using Tauc's equation of αhv =A(hv − Eg)2 [64], which is close to the values reported in previous studies [50]. The slight differences in the photoabsorption and band gap are likely related to the effect of size, shape and exposed crystal plane in these two different KNbO3 nanostructures [36].\nTo obtain information regarding the band structures of the KNbO3 nanostructures, ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) were measured (Fig. 2d), for which the energy is calibrated by subtracting the secondary electron onset position of the He I photon energy (21.22 eV) [28]. As a result, the valence band maximum (VBM) positions of the KNbO3 NS and NC (vs. NHE) were calculated to be about 2.86 and 2.75 eV, respectively. Based on the estimated band gap energy using UV–vis DRS (Fig. 2c), the conduction band minimum (CBM) position\nwas therefore calculated at −0.21 and −0.27 eV (vs. NHE) for the NS and NC, respectively, indicating that the reduction of water to H2 by KNbO3 is thermodynamically favourable. Our results are consistent with both experimental and theoretical works reported previously [57,58]."

The AFM topographic images of the typical KNbO3 NS and NC dispersed on the Pt/Ti/ SiO2/Si substrate are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. A localized point to point piezo-response was studied by applying a bias voltage. The obtained PFM amplitude and phase signals of the KNbO3 NS and NC are presented in Fig. 3c and d, respectively. For the NS sample, a\nwell-defined typical butterfly amplitude loop was observed, along with an abrupt phase change from 30° to 210° when sweeping the DC voltage from −28 V to + 28 V, demonstrating the local switching of the ferroelectric polarization in the KNbO3 NS. For the NC sample, a weaker amplitude response and an incomplete phase (from 10° to 160°) loop were obtained, even when a much higher bias voltage ( ± 42 V) was applied, illustrating that the NC has a relatively weak ferroelectric character in comparison with the NS. The hysteresis loops of the KNbO3 NS and NC have opposite directions, suggesting different ferroelectric domain orientations in these two samples. PFM response under different excitation voltages (Figs. S3 and S4) exhibits a clear resonant peak near 223 kHz and 192 kHz for the NS and NC sample, respectively. Moreover, the amplitude shows a clear linear relationship with the\nexcitation voltage for both samples (Fig. S5), confirming the linear piezoelectricity [65]. These results clearly indicate that the NS has higher ferroelectric response that may lead to greater piezoelectric-induced catalytic activity and polarization-modulated PEC performance."

      "text" : "The photo-/piezocatalytic performance of different KNbO3 nanostructures was evaluated using RhB as the probe molecule under different conditions: (i) ultrasonic vibration, (ii) simulated solar light irradiation, and (iii) both ultrasonic vibration and simulated solar light irradiation. The degradation efficiency curves and UV–vis absorption spectra of RhB solution are displayed in Figs. S6 and S7, respectively,\nand the corresponding rate constant k values (derived as the slope of the ln(C0/C) - t plot according to the first-order kinetics) are shown in Fig. 4a. With ultrasonic vibration only, 32.4% of the RhB solution can be degraded using the KNbO3 NS in 2 h, whereas merely 9.0% of the RhB was removed with the NC sample under the same conditions, clearly demonstrating that the KNbO3 NS has superior piezo-catalytic activity compared to the NC sample. The polarization direction plays an important role in the pizeo-catalytic properties of the KNbO3 NS and NC. The KNbO3 NS sample has two polarization components (perpendicular and parallel to the exposed surfaces), while the KNbO3 NC sample has only one polarization component. When applying mechanical force provided by ultrasonic vibration, the KNbO3 NS sample can be bended in both directions which results in more piezopotential induced carriers, and thus leads to the better pizeo-catalytic performance, compared to that of the NC sample.\nIn addition, the degradation efficiency over the KNbO3 nanostructures could be significantly enhanced by combining ultrasonic vibration and sunlight illumination. It is important to note that although the KNbO3 NS shows better photocatalytic activity than the NC due to the slightly enhanced light absorption and larger surface area (5.62 m2 g−1 for the NS and 8.23 m2 g−1 for the NC), the NS sample exhibits faster degradation rate (k of 0.022 min−1) compared to the NC sample (k of 0.016 min−1) under simultaneous ultrasonic vibration and sunlight illumination. Most importantly, the degradation efficiency reached as high as 92.6% in only 2 h for the KNbO3 NS, which is higher than the values reported previously for piezoelectric ZnSnO3 nanowires [66] and NaNO3 nanorods [67]. Furthermore, the degradation activity of the KNbO3 NS under different ultrasonic powers (150 W and 300 W) was also investigated (Fig. S8), demonstrating that the degradation rates decrease with decreasing ultrasonic power. Since these two samples have the same crystal structure, very similar band gaps and specific surface area, we can conclude that the enhanced catalytic performance of the NS should be mainly due to the piezo-electrochemical effect.\nTo test the universality of the KNbO3 samples for decomposing other dye molecules, we have performed degradation experiments for congo red (CR) solution using the NS sample under different conditions. As shown in Fig. S9, the KNbO3 NS showed excellent degradation efficiency (> 80% within only 1.5 h) under both ultrasonic vibration and simulated sunlight irradiation. Moreover, the cycling experiments for the piezo-photocatalytic degradation of RhB with the KNbO3 NS were also conducted. As displayed in Fig. 4b, the efficiency remains constant over 3 consecutive cycles, indicating the excellent stability of the catalyst under simultaneous ultrasonic vibration and light irradiation. In addition, to reveal the role of the radical species in the piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic process, a series of controlled experiments were performed by introducing different scavengers into the reaction system. As shown in Fig. 4c, the piezocatalytic performance of the KNbO3 NS decreases slightly after the addition of disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA-2Na), whereas it is remarkably inhibited by the addition of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and benzoquinone (BQ). These results indicate that •OH and •O2− are the major active oxidative species for RhB over the KNbO3 nanostructures. Furthermore, similar results were obtained for the trapping experiments under both ultrasonic vibrations and light irradiation (Fig. 4d). These results indicate that the piezo-electrochemical effect in the KNbO3 nanostructures allows in-situ generation of electron/hole pairs. Moreover, under light illumination, the piezoelectric field could also drive the photogenerated electron/ hole pairs to migrate to the surface in the opposite directions. The electrons react with dissolved O2 to yield •O2−, and the holes are ultimately trapped by H2O at the surface to form •OH radicals. Finally, these free radicals can oxidize the RhB dye molecules in the aqueous solution."

      "text" : "Manipulation of the internal fields and band bending through\npolarization in ferroelectric materials has been proven to be a promising strategy for improving the PEC performance. In the present work, KNbO3 nanostructure-based photoelectrodes were fabricated to understand the effect of ferroelectric polarization on their PEC properties. The transient photocurrent responses of the NS and NC photoelectrodes are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. The intrinsic sample shows an intermediate value of the same sample that has undergone − 2 V and + 2 V treatment, possibly due to the random distribution of the KNbO3 nanostructures. Under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW/cm2) at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the photocurrent density changes from 0.53 to 0.82 μA cm−2 for the NS and from 0.55 to 0.69 μA cm−2 for the NC when the poling bias of the pretreatment is manipulated from + 2 V to − 2 V, illustrating the excellent capability for tuning the PEC performance in the KNbO3 photoelectrodes. Notably, the KNbO3 NS photoelectrode exhibits a greater PEC performance tunability of ~55% obtained by modulating the ferroelectric polarization conditions, compared to ~25% for the NC photoelectrode, which should be due to the higher ferroelectric responses of the NS sample as confirmed by the PFM characterizations.\nTo investigate the intrinsic charge transfer resistance and recombination behaviour of the KNbO3 photoelectrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were measured. The EIS curves are shown in Fig. 5c. Generally, the smaller the arc radius on the EIS Nyquist plot, the lower the charge transfer resistance [68,69]. The negatively poled KNbO3 NS photoelectrode shows a smaller arc radius than either the unpoled or positively poled sample, revealing that negative poling treatment favours the transfer and separation of the electron/hole pairs. The KNbO3 NC based photoanodes demonstrate the same tendency, as shown in Fig. S10. The corresponding Bode phase curves were calculated using the equation τ = 1/(2πf) (Fig. 5d), where τ is the lifetime of the electrons and f is the minimum inverse frequency. The negatively poled NS electrode gives a longer injected electron lifetime of 33.7 µs compared to 24.6 and 13.1 µs for the intrinsic and positively poled samples, respectively. Furthermore, PL measurements (Fig. 5f) reveal that the peak intensity of the KNbO3 NS photoelectrode was strongly suppressed after applying a bias of − 2 V compared to the same electrode after the application of the + 2 V pretreatment, suggesting that the recombination of the photogenerated charges is effectively initiated by the negative poling treatment. Additionally, IPCE measurements of the KNbO3 NS photoelectrodes at the wavelengths from 300 to 450 nm were performed under different polarization conditions (Fig. 5e). The IPCE values corresponds well to the photoabsorption spectrum of the KNbO3 NS (Fig. 2c). In agreement with the results of the PL analysis, it was found that the negative poling treatment results in higher IPCE values compared to the values obtained for the same electrode after the application of the + 2 V poling and no poling treatments."

      "text" : "The physical origin for the variation of piezoelectricity is thought to be due to the extremely large surface/volume ratio that is related to not only the size but also the shape of the nanocrystals [50,52]. To understand the piezoelectric properties of the two different KNbO3 nanostructures in greater depth, FEM analysis using the COMSOL multiphysics software was performed to simulate the generated piezoelectric potential under mechanical pressure provided by ultrasonic wave vibration. The geometrical parameters of the width (W), length (L) and height (H) were set as 50 nm×1 µm×1 µm and 700 nm×700 nm×700 nm for the KNbO3 NS and NC models, respectively. Taking into account the acoustic pressure (105 to 106 Pa) and the impact force caused by acoustic cavitation (about 108 Pa), FEM simulations were carried out at the two pressures of 0.1 and 100 MPa, respectively [20]. The bottom surface of the model was fixed and grounded, and compressive stress was applied to the upper surface along the negative z-\naxis. For a typical simulation with P= 100 MPa, the maximum potential output of the KNbO3 NS is approximately 1.4 V (Fig. 6c), much higher than that of the KNbO3 NC (0.9 V) (Fig. 6f). Obviously, the maximum potential difference is proportional to the isostatic pressure magnitude. Thus, the simulation results obtained under 0.1 MPa follow the same tendency (Fig. 6b and e). These results indicate that mechanical energy deforms the KNbO3 NS more easily to produce a high electrical potential that can effectively accelerate the separation of photogenerated carriers. The EFM simulations are in agreement with the experimental results discussed above. The corresponding catalytic reaction mechanisms for these two different KNbO3 nanostructures are schematically illustrated in Fig. 6a and d.\nPolarization engineering in ferroelectrics is crucial for tuning the internal (depolarization) electric field and obtaining optimal surface band structures to enhance their PEC properties [9,35,56]. Based on our results, simplified schematic energy band diagrams (constructed based on the results of the UPS analysis shown in Fig. 2d) of KNbO3-based photoanode under different polarization configurations are depicted in Fig. 6(g-i). Prior to the poling treatment (Fig. 6g), the ferroelectric domains in the KNbO3 nanostructures dispersed on the ITO substrate are randomly orientated. The negative electric poling (Pdown, Fig. 6h) will produce a negative charge on the surface of KNbO3 away from the ITO substrate, to the contrary, leading to symmetric positive charges. On the other hand, the positive electric polarization pointing up towards the surface of the electrode (Pup, Fig. 6i) will generate positive and negative charges on the upper and lower surfaces of KNbO3, respectively. In addition, the polarization-induced internal electric field in KNbO3 will cause surface band banding, resulting in different charge transfer behaviour across the interfaces. After poling by negative bias, the photogenerated electrons and holes will easily migrate to the ITO substrate and electrolyte, respectively, due to the desirable upward band bending at the electrode/electrolyte interface and downward bending at the KNbO3/ITO junction, which can reduce the recombination of the photogenerated electron/hole pairs and thus enhance the PEC efficiency. By contrast, the KNbO3 electrode with positive poling treatment has band bending in the opposite direction on both sides, which prevents the photogenerated holes from moving to the surface of the KNbO3 nanostructures and hinders the transfer of electrons to the ITO bottom electrode, leading to a decreased PEC performance."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "In summary, taking two different KNbO3 nanostructures (nanosheets and nanocubes) as models of piezo-/ferroelectric materials, the important roles of the piezoelectric effect and ferroelectric polarization for controlling their photocatalytic and PEC properties were demonstrated. Due to the superior piezo-/ferroelectric properties confirmed by local PFM measurements and FEM simulations, KNbO3 nanosheets exhibited enhanced piezo-photocatalytic activity under the periodic mechanical strain provided by ultrasonic vibrations as well as a larger tunability of the PEC water splitting performance via the poling pretreatment compared to those of the nanocubes sample. This enhancement is correlated with the piezo-potential and electric field induced by the ferroelectric polarization and with the corresponding band bending at the junctions, which can effectively separate the photogenerated charge carriers. Our findings may provide useful guidance for the development of other piezo-/ferroelectric materials for solar energy conversion."

It is important to develop desirable piezo-/ferroelectric nanostructures to realize the full potential of polarization-modulated built-in electric fields that can effectively separate excited electron/hole pairs. In this work, taking KNbO3 as a representative material, we show that two-dimensional nanosheets exhibit greatly improved piezo-photocatalytic degradation efficiency for organic dyes compared to that of nanocubes. In addition, effective tuning of the PEC water splitting property by manipulating the ferroelectric polarization was observed in these KNbO3 nanostructures, demonstrating versatile and tuneable devices for solar energy conversion. By changing the poling configuration, a significant photocurrent density enhancement of 55% was achieved for KNbO3 nanosheets, which is much greater than the 25% enhancement observed for the nanocube counterparts. These results could be attributed to the larger piezo-/ferroelectric response in the nanosheets as determined by piezoresponse force microscopy analysis and piezoelectric potential simulation based on the finite element method. Our findings may provide insights into strategies for designing highly efficient piezo-/ferroelectric nanomaterials for solar energy",
