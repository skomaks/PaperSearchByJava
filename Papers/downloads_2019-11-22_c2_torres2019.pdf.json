Its biocompatibility and remarkable mechanical properties have promoted scientific interest for its use in a variety of applications including biomedical, electrical, among others. However, it is the possibility of incorporating nanosized materials into the coherent 3-D network structure displayed by BC what has propelled multiple investigations on the development of BC nanocomposites for different applications. Here we report the different methods and techniques used so far for the BC nanocomposites production. We have focused on the processing techniques that allow the incorporation of functional nanoreinforcements, nanofillers and additional phases without disturbing the original network structure, leading to the formation of nanomaterials. Processing methods, resulting structure-property relationships and potential applications of these novel nanocomposites are discussed and showcased as a fair example of integrated design and manufacture of materials."

      "text" : "Manufacturing companies, government agencies at all levels and consumers increasingly require the use of biodegradable materials, in order to reduce the environmental impact generated by the current lifestyle. Natural cellulose-based materials (which are the most abundant polysaccharides in nature [1–3] and include wood, hemp, cotton, among others) have been used for a long time by our society for these applications due to their wide availability, renewability, and biodegradability. Along the same lines, the study and use of bacterial cellulose is relatively recent. Despite sharing a common backbone, there are marked differences between plant and bacterial cellulose. Plant fibers are composed of lignin, hemicelluloses, pectin and only 40–70% of cellulose [4]; in contrast, bacterial cellulose is made up of pure cellulose nanofibers, displaying high purity and strength, without requiring subsequent refining treatments. Owing to these unique characteristics, bacterial cellulose (BC) has been extensively studied and characterized [5–8].\nBC is a material synthesized extracellularly by certain types of bacteria such as Acetobacter, Azotobacter, Gluconacetobacter, Pseudomonas, Salmonella and Sarcina ventriculi [6]. Among them, the most effective and, thus, the most used bacteria for cellulose production are Gluconacetobacter xylinum, Gluconacetobacter hansenii, and Gluconacetobacter pasteurianus [9]. According to Czaja et al. [10], cellulose biosynthesis starts when bacteria polymerize glucose residues into\nlinear β-1,4-glucan chains and produce an extracellular secretion of the formed chains. Last, they assemble and crystallize the chains into composed ribbons. This process leads to the formation of a coherent ultra-thin three-dimensional network of cellulose nanofibers aligned in parallel to the surface of a liquid medium (see Fig. 1). This network is called a pellicle and its geometry is determined by intra- and intermolecular hydrogen-bonding network, hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions [11].\nBC has a crystallographic structure typical of cellulose type Iα [12], with a degree of crystallinity up to 90% [13]. The several hydroxyl groups on BC surface make it a hydrophilic material [14]. BC nanofibers are around 20–100 nm in diameter and display a surface area superior to that of vegetal cellulose [15]. Grande et al. [16] analyzed the mechanical properties of BC films, yielding an average tensile strength of 241.42 ± 21.86MPa, a maximum elongation value of 8.21 ± 3.01% and Young's modulus of 6.86 ± 0.32 GPa.\nThe functionality, flexibility and excellent mechanical properties of bacterial cellulose have been considered adequate for certain applications in the past. However, the contemporary need for BC-based products with superior properties to meet the demand in diverse fields becomes increasingly evident. Modern BC-based composites involve the use of nanosized elements of particular characteristics. Since BC has a nanofibers arrangement, the developed materials consist of the interaction of two nanometric structures, which we call nano-nano composites.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.msec.2019.01.064 Received 10 May 2018; Received in revised form 14 January 2019; Accepted 14 January 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author.

The nanomaterials used for the preparation of BCbased nanocomposites are reviewed, including conducting polymers [17,18], graphene oxide [19,20], carbon nanotubes [21], ceramics [22,23] and biopolymers [24,25]. We also explain how the addition of these nanomaterials improve the electrical, optical and mechanical properties of BC, enabling its application in acoustic diaphragms [26], supercapacitors and biosensors [27], and biomedical applications [28–30]. A systematic classification of the BC-based materials is proposed, taking into account i) the BC fiber network final state (destroyed or preserved), and ii) the technique used to incorporate the second phase."

      "text" : "It is indeed the ability to incorporate other materials into the coherent BC network structure what has allowed for the development of a variety of nanocomposites for multiple applications. In this section, we review the different types of materials that have been used so far in BC nanocomposites formation.\n2.1. BC nanofibrils as reinforcing fillers\nBacterial cellulose can be used as a reinforcement of nanoscale dimensions, whereas the micrometer-scale diameter of polymer fibers can act as a substrate for BC attachment. Juntaro et al. [31] developed a process to cover sisal fibers with BC. They used these BC-covered sisal fibers to reinforce a poly-L-lactic acid (PLA) matrix. First, they added the sisal fibers (tensile strength and Young's modulus of 383MPa and 15.2 GPa, respectively) to the BC growth medium. After 4–7 days of incubation a transparent BC pellicle covered the sisal fibers. The fiber pull-out tests showed that the interfacial adhesion of the BC-covered sisal fibers was increased. The elastic modulus and tensile strength of the BC/PLA composites was higher when the BC-covered sisal fibers were used (11.21 GPa and 113.8MPa, respectively, in contrast to 7.91 GPa and 78.9MPa). Pommet et al. [32] used a similar procedure to incorporate bacterial cellulose-modified sisal fibers into cellulose acetate butyrate matrices, reporting a significant improvement of interfacial adhesion and mechanical performance. Lee et al. [33] used acrylated epoxidised soybean oil (AESO) to develop sisal fiber/polyAESO and BC-sisal fiber/polyAESO composites. The tensile modulus for neat polyAESO was 0.4 GPa. The addition of 40 vol% sisal fibers improved the tensile modulus to 3.2 GPa, and further improvement was achieved with BC used as a binder, up to 5.6 GPa. Bacterial cellulose nanofibers were used as a filler for glass-fiber-reinforced epoxy composites [34]. By the incorporation of 0.3 wt% BC nanofibers, the interlaminar fracture toughness for crack initiation and crack separation\nwere improved by 128.8% and 1110%, respectively. Phomrak et al. [35] developed natural rubber composites reinforced with BC via a latex aqueous microdispersion process. The hydrophilicity, opacity, and crystallinity of the composite were improved by incremental BC loading. The reinforcement with BC nanofibers yields a material with 4128.4MPa of Young's modulus and tensile strength of 75.1MPa. At lower BC nanofibers reinforcement, the material presented high elastic elongation, which may be suitable for rubber-based products and elastic packaging."

These are a family of highly conjugated polymers with spatially extended π-bonding, which present unique electrical, electrochemical and optical properties [37]. The aim of incorporating conductive polymers into BC is to develop flexible nanocomposites that can be used as electrolytes or stimuli-responsive membranes in solar energy devices, biosensors and biomedical devices. Among the most used conductive polymers are polyaniline (PAni), polypyrrole (PPY), poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV)."

[39] developed BCsupported polyaniline by in situ polymerization of aniline onto the BC matrix. The nanocomposite displayed an electrical conductivity of 5.1 S cm−1 and a mass capacitance of 273 F·g−1 at 0.2 A·g−1. Marins et al. [40] added polyaniline doped with dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid by in situ chemical polymerization on hydrated BC sheets, which led to a conductivity of 2.09× 10−2 S cm−1. Müller et al. [18] followed a similar procedure, adding polyaniline through in situ oxidative chemical polymerization of BC films, with FeCl3·6H2O as oxidant and the presence of HCl in an aqueous solution. They reported a conductivity of 0.9 S cm−1, evidencing that the crystalline structure of BC remained intact and the electrical properties improved as the reaction time increased since it stimulated a more significant and complete coating. Likewise, Hu et al. [17] performed an in situ oxidative polymerization of PAni, improving the thermal stability and finding a conductivity of 5× 10−2 S cm−1 for a PAni content of 10.7 wt% and a reaction time of 90min. Moreover, the mechanical measurements gave a Young's modulus value of 5.6 GPa and a tensile strength of 95.7MPa, being superior to pristine BC characteristics. Recently, Wan et al. [41] developed a flexible BC/graphene/PAni by uniform dispersion of graphene on the BC matrix and a subsequent PAni deposition on the surfaces of graphene layers and BC fibers. They reported an electrical conductivity of 1.7 S cm−1."

The paper electrodes presented a stable and efficient performance, with a capacitance of 2.43 F cm−2. Similarly, Peng et al.

Müller et al. [45] performed an in situ polymerization of pyrrole (Py) in a BC film using ammonium persulfate (APS) and FeCl3·6H2O as oxidants. BC/PPyAPS presented homogeneously distributed spherical conductive nanoparticles, while BC/PPy-FeCl3 revealed the formation of a continuous conductive layer that covered BC nanofibers. After analyzing the mechanical and electrical properties of the BC/PPy nanocomposites, they reported a conductivity of 2.7 S cm−1 and tensile strength of 4.1 MPa when FeCl3·6H2O was the oxidant agent. Lay et al. [42] performed the in situ polymerization of pyrrole on BC, using FeCl3. The BC/PPy membrane acquired a conductivity of 3.9 S cm−1 and a specific capacitance of 191 F·g−1, which could be fully implemented in biomedical sensors and energy storage devices."

In order to make PEDOT processable, poly (styrene sulfonic acid) is used as dopant. PSS reduces the conductivity of PEDOT from 300 S cm−1 to 10 S cm−1, but PEDOT:PSS samples display high visible light transmissivity and great stability [48]. Khan et al. [49] carried out the ex situ incorporation of commercial poly(3,4ethylene dioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) polymer into BC pellicles. The BC/PEDOT:PSS nanocomposites displayed a conductivity of 12.17 S cm−1, which is one of the highest values obtained for BC-based nanocomposites. Kim et al. [50] deposited PEDOT:PSS conductive layers on the top and bottom of a BC film by dipping and drying it, forming electro-active hybrid actuators. Aleshin et al. [51] synthesized BC/PEDOT:PSS, which presented a strong absorption near the infrared spectral region, with a potential application in the development of biocompatible electrodes. Bu et al. [52] evenly coated the surface of BC fibers with PEDOT, forming an ultrathin flexible paper electrode, which displayed a volumetric capacitance of 106.3 F cm−3 at a volumetric current density of 0.83 A cm−3."

They saturated a BC film with MEH-PPV (poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene]vinylene) by dipping the BC film in a MEHPPV/chloroform solution for 15 h. The photo-luminescence spectroscopy tests showed that the photoluminescence spectrum of BC/ MEH:PPV films contained emission contributions from both BC and MEH:PPV. This result suggests that BC/MEH:PPV nanocomposites could be used for the production of transparent light-emitting papers for display, lighting and biosensor devices."

      "heading" : "2.3. Metals",
      "text" : "A different approach to enhance the properties of BC nanocomposites is the use of metallic nanoparticles. These inorganic materials can\nbe associated with the hydrophilic bacterial cellulose matrix, occupying its void spaces and interacting with BC fiber chains [37]. Due to their size and the surface effects, they allow adjusting the properties of the final nanocomposite. Some of the metal nanoparticles used in the past for BC nanocomposites include iron, silver, gold, copper, palladium and metal alloys, among others.\nZhang et al. [55] used magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles to reinforce BC through in situ synthesis of Fe3O4, developing a flexible magnetic membrane. They achieved a homogeneous distribution of magnetite over the matrix. Zhu et al. [56] employed Fe3O4 as an adsorbent for heavy metal ions, reporting a high adsorption capacity and recyclability after ions elution. Sriplai et al. [57] fabricated magnetic BC composites by immersing a freeze-dried scaffold into a water-based ferrofluid containing Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles. Their sensitivity to external magnetic forces opens a nearly exhaustless potential of possible applications.\nSilver and its derivatives exhibit strong inhibitory and bactericidal effects [58–60] and have been used for many biomedical applications [61,62]. Maneerung et al. [58] immersed a BC film into a silver nitrate solution. Then, sodium borohydride was used to reduce the incorporated Ag+ into metallic silver nanoparticles. The results showed strong antimicrobial activity of the BC/silver films against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Wu et al. [63] developed a novel method to perform an in-situ synthesis of Ag nanoparticles on BC membranes. BC membranes were soaked in a silver ammonia solution (Tollen's reagent). The guest molecules of Tollens' reagent diffused into the inner spaces of BC nanopores and reacted with cellulose fibers, forming an AgNP-BC composite. The results showed a strong interaction between the silver nanoparticles and BC fibers, which prevented the drop of Ag nanoparticles from the BC network, minimizing toxic effects. AgNP-BC exhibited significant antibacterial activities with more than 99% reductions in Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nGold nanoparticles receive the attention of researchers due to their outstanding optical, electronic, and chemical properties [64]. BC/Au nanocomposites have been used as catalyst [65–67], trace concentration detection [68] and biosensors devices [69]. Zhang et al. [69] reduced HAuCl4 with polyethyleneimine (PEI, a reducing agent) in a solution to obtain Au nanoparticles in aqueous dispersion. The authors uniformly coated BC nanofibers using the nanoparticle suspension, considering the PEI role as a linking agent. Subsequently, a biosensor was developed by embedding horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the structure of the BC/Au nanocomposite, which displayed a high sensitivity detection of H2O2. Liu et al. [70] elaborated conductive cellulose films by a self-assembly procedure, using an aqueous gold dispersion of nanoparticles. The films displayed an electrical conductive behavior when the gold nanoparticle loading was higher than 20wt%.\nPeng et al. [71] used BC covered with polypyrrole/copper oxide to prepare a conductive membrane. The BC/polypyrrole/copper oxide membrane had an electrical conductivity of 7.4 S cm−1 and a capacitance of 601 F·g−1, being suitable for flexible energy-storage devices. Among other nanoparticles, Chen et al. [72] synthesized zinc oxide particles using a polyol method, to introduce Zn2+ ions. Peng et al. [44] coated the BC membrane with polypyrrole/nickel sulfide, achieving a conductivity of 5.1 S cm−1. Yang et al. [73] carried out the in situ deposition of Pt nanoparticles on BC, finding that the BC/Pt membrane presented a high electrocatalytic activity in the hydrogen oxidation reaction.\nBC films were immersed in a mixture solution of PdCl2 and CuCl2 in water. The adsorbed metallic ions were reduced inside the BC matrix to Pd-Cu nanoparticles using potassium borohydride, obtaining a composite with high catalytic activity [74]. Olsson et al. [75] developed a stiff magnetic nanopaper using bacterial cellulose fibrils as templates for ferromagnetic cobalt ferrite nanoparticles growth."

The use of graphene and its derivatives could impressively enhance the inherent properties of BC. Luo et al. [79] dispersed graphene in the BC culture medium using a layer-by-layer interface culture strategy to obtain BC/ graphene nanocomposite hydrogels. The methodology consists of repetitive cycles of spraying the culture medium onto the base membrane until it is completely consumed. The BC/graphene hydrogels exhibited 91% improvement in tensile strength and 279% improvement in tensile modulus compared to pure BC. Zhou et al. [83] added graphite nanoplates to pristine BC membranes using two methods: immersion and sonication. The comparison showed a more significant increase in electrical conductivity for sonication (conductivity of 1.2 S cm−1). Shao et al. [84] crushed BC pellicles using a high speed homogenizer to achieve BC fiber slurry. Graphene aqueous solution was added into the BC homogenate and treated by ultrasonication followed by preparation of BC/graphene composite films. Results showed that graphene addition decreased the water retention capacity of BC, although the mechanical properties were enhanced in comparison to pure BC. These results are attributed to a uniform dispersion of graphene in the BC matrix, good miscibility and strong interfacial interactions between them [78]."

After its characterization against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, they concluded that the composite presented excellent antibacterial activities. Liu et al.

The resultant material presented high electrical conductivity (1.32 S cm−1) and large volumetric capacitance (278 F cm−3). Luo et al. [88] used a layer-by-layer assembly strategy. A pure BC membrane was used as a base (named BC0). They added a GO suspension to the culture medium of BC, and the GO-dispersed culture medium was sprayed on the surface of BC0, building a BC/GO\nmembrane. Once the medium was consumed, the procedure was repeated, until the desired thickness was reached. The developed hydrogels presented improved mechanical properties in comparison with BC and previously reported BC/GO composites.\nGraphene oxide has also been used in its reduced form. The reduced graphene oxide (RGO) formation can be carried out thermally [89,90], chemically [90–92] or by irradiation [93,94], enhancing the conductivity and partially recovering the original structure and properties of graphene [85].

A similar procedure was followed by Kim et al. [127]. They developed BC/chitosan nanocomposites via BC immersion in a chitosan solution followed by a freeze-drying step.

Despite the poor mechanical characteristics of gelatin, BC/gelatin double network gels can sustain almost 3MPa and display an elastic modulus of 23MPa, 112 times higher than the elastic modulus of gelatin. Grande et al. [24] developed a self-assembling procedure to incorporate starch into a BC matrix (Fig. 4). They added starch to the growth medium and autoclaved it, which induced the gelatinization of starch. The bacteria synthesized BC fibers in the presence of the partially gelatinized starch granules. With this bottom-up process, starch was incorporated into the BC network maintaining the crystallinity degree of native BC with a smooth decrease in the mechanical properties. Wan et al. [130] incorporated plasticized starch to BC nanofibers. Starch and glycerin were mixed (30% w/w glycerin to starch), and later the BC membrane was immersed in the solution. The BC/starch nanocomposite displayed a superior tensile strength and modulus than starch, but a lower elongation at break."

This behavior favored the development of BC nanocomposites through self-assembly [24], matrix irradiation [133], controlled dispersions within matrix polymers and controlled particle-matrix bond strength [134].\nAs emphasized throughout this section, the main characteristic of the BC matrix is that, instead of being a concentrated structure of\nmolecules, it has a nanofibers arrangement. Therefore, it can be considered as a supra-molecular structure of nanometric dimensions. Since most of the dispersed phases also present a nanometric scale size, the majority of BC nanocomposites are formed from the interaction of two nanometric supra-molecular structures. In that sense, considering the components that lead to the formation of BC nanocomposites (see classification diagram in Fig. 5), the generated material should be adequately denominated a nano-nano composite."

The use of a particular method depends on the nature of the combining phase and the envisaged application for the BC nanocomposites. In general, BC has been used as a matrix (to be loaded with nanofillers), or as a reinforcement.

In contrast, the biocomposite sheets with apple and radish pulp after BC reinforcement showed an improvement of 2 GPa in Young's modulus (from 4.5 GPa to 6.5 GPa). Feng et al. [76] prepared BC/GO composite by mixing GO and aqueous suspensions of disintegrated BC at fixed concentrations. The BC/GO mixture was then sonicated, filtered and dried for 24 h at 50 °C to form films. The films presented up to 20% of Young's modulus increase in comparison with pristine BC.\nNakagaito et al. [135] prepared BC/phenol-formaldehyde\nnanocomposite films. The nanocomposite films were cut into pieces, stacked into layers of 25 sheets and hot-pressed. The Young's modulus of the nanocomposites was 28 GPa, higher than the modulus of pure BC sheets (19 GPa). They attributed the improvement to the uniform, continuous, and straight nano-scalar network of cellulosic elements oriented in-plane via the compression of BC film. Chiaoprakobkij et al. [136] formed a porous sponge from the blend of BC and sodium alginate. The BC pellicle was pressed and later mixed with sodium alginate at different weight ratios in distilled water. The slurry mixture was placed in Petri dishes and crosslinked with an aqueous CaCl2 solution. The composite exhibited a high mechanical strength, high water uptake ability, and structural stability. Amin et al. [137] combined lyophilized BC powder with acrylic acid (AAc) in an aqueous dispersion and subsequently exposed the mixture to accelerated electron-beam irradiation, forming BC/AAc hydrogels. The higher the amount of AAc in the gel, the higher the AAc degree of polymerization in polyacrylic acid (PAAc). In addition, those with a higher dose of radiation revealed a higher extracted weight and gel fraction, which suggests that a higher dose and a higher amount of AAc results in a highly crosslinked and insoluble network."

BC whiskers are highly crystalline rod-like particles that are extracted by acid hydrolysis of bacterial cellulose microfibrils [141]. Their reinforcement ability lies in their high surface area and excellent mechanical properties [142,143]. Nevertheless, they should be well separated and distributed in the matrix [144].\nIt has been reported that the treatment of BC with acid [145,146] allowed extracting cellulose nanowhiskers effectively. Cellulose whiskers were incorporated into nanofibers of polyethylene oxide (PEO) by the electrospinning process to enhance the mechanical properties of the electrospun PEO fibers. The whiskers were partially aligned despite some aggregated areas. However, an increase in Young's modulus, tensile strength, and elongation at break was observed as the concentration increased [141]. Martínez-Sanz et al.

Then, the formation of the BC/fibrin membrane required the immersion of never-dried BC sheets in the fibrin solution. Later, the composites were immersed in glutaraldehyde solution at 80 °C. The action of glutaraldehyde promoted the crosslinking of hydroxyl groups of BC and the amide groups of fibrin, producing materials with similar tensile strength, modulus and time-dependent viscoelastic behavior compared with a small-diameter blood vessel. Castro et al. [148] have reported the crosslinking of the BC network via glyoxalization with glyoxal. The process started through medium modification using glyoxal, non-formaldehyde crosslinking agent. The process is started in situ, in the culture medium during biosynthesis of cellulose. This allowed the formation of covalent\nbonds between glyoxal and BC ribbons, which caused an improvement in hydrophobicity. A similar approach was performed by Quero et al. [149]. Yang et al.

Several methods performing BC surface modification have been proposed, including but not limited to carboxymethylation, acetylation, alkylation, and sulfation. Acetylated bacterial cellulose is one of the most common BC derivatives used. The acetylation treatment replaces the hydroxyl groups of the unmodified BC by less hydrophilic acetyl groups, leading to an improvement in the thermal and moisture stability of BC-based materials. The optimization of the variables involved in the BC acetylation process such as reaction time, catalyst content and temperature allows tailoring the acetylation extent conferred to BC [151]. Goncalves et al. [152] extracted a subjacent lamina from the basement membrane of a porcine bladder (UBM). The digested UBM solution was used to coat acetylated bacterial cellulose (ABC), generating a moderate hydrophobic surface that was advantageous for retinal pigment epithelium cells adhesion and proliferation.\nDuring carboxymethylation of BC, the cellulose hydroxyl groups are replaced by carboxyl groups, which promote the appearance of coordinate sites. Lin et al. [153] prepared a blend of carboxymethyl bacterial cellulose (CBC)/sodium alginate by an ionic crosslinking with Ca2+. The composite presented an improvement up to 152% in tensile strength, besides a marked improvement in swelling and thermal properties.\nLin et al. [154] carried out the first alkylation of BC, by etherification with alkyl bromide. Qin et al. [155] alkylated BC using alkyl halide in ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and NaH as the base. The resultant derivatives have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups on their backbones, whose versatility may result advantageous for a wide variety of applications. Zhu et al. [156] characterized the properties of sulfated BC (SBC). They found that sulfation disrupts the crystalline structure of BC, which was reflected in a severe\ndegradation. The careful control of the moisture content in BC allowed to produce SBC with a high degree of substitution."

Then, the initiators are exposed to an adequate source of excitation, such as heat or light. This exposition triggers the in-situ polymerization process that forms the nanocomposite. Müller et al. [159] developed BC/PPy nanocomposites through in-situ oxidative chemical polymerization. Dried BC membranes were immersed in pyrrole aqueous solution of pyrrole using FeCl3·6H2O as oxidant agent. Figueiredo et al. [160] performed an in situ radical polymerizations of 2-aminoethyl methacrylate, using N, N-methylene bis(acrylamide) as a crosslinker to obtain films of improved thermal and mechanical properties. Peng et al. [161] immersed BC membranes in a 1% styrene (St) solution with azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator. The immersed samples were pressed at 85 °C for 5 h to carry out the polymerization of the styrene monomers absorbed in the BC membranes. The BC/PS sheets showed superior mechanical properties compared to pure PS sheets. Choi et al. [162] used BC for the development of environmentally compatible ionexchange membranes. BC was immersed in benzophenone (BP) methanol solution, used as a photo-initiator, and then irradiated with UV light. An AAc solution was added to the activated BC membrane, to introduce ion-exchangeable groups. A methanol/acetone solution was used to thoroughly clean the resulting acrylic acid-treated bacterial cellulose (AAc-modified BC) membrane. The modified BC/AAc membrane acquired an ion-exchange capacity of 2.5meq·g−1 and greater structural density, as well as a tensile strength of 12MPa and 6.0% elongation. Also, Hu et al. [17] synthesized polyaniline/bacterial cellulose (BC/PAni) nanocomposites by in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline. The Young's modulus and tensile strength of BC decreased from 20 GPa and 357.3MPa to 5.6 GPa and 95.7MPa respectively after polyaniline addition. However, it increased the thermal stability of the flexible membrane and imparted the composite an electrical conductivity of 5× 10−2 S cm−1.\n3.2.1.2. Matrix deposition. BC occurs naturally in the form of a threedimensional nanosized network with a highly porous structure. Matrix deposition consists of the diffusion of a filler solution into the BC matrix. The diffusion is achieved by immersing BC membranes in an aqueous solution of fillers or by injecting fillers that are soluble in water into the three-dimensional arrangement, forcing nanofillers to remain inside the pores through different bonding mechanisms. After evaporation of the solvent, the filler covers the surface of BC nanofibers and its internal pores. Later, it is dried or hot pressed to form a strong composite. Typically, matrix deposition is part of a larger and more complex procedure for nanocomposites formation. Kang et al. [163] developed all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors based on BC. A BC pellicle was pressed under 10MPa and later a carbon nanotubes (CNT) ink solution was poured onto the membrane.\nChen et al. [164] fabricated an asymmetric supercapacitor based on a 3D nanofibrous carbon network of bacterial cellulose pellicles by annealing for 2 h in an N2 atmosphere. Then, the films were immersed in a 0.1 M KMnO4/0.1M K2SO4 aqueous solution to obtain the\nnanocomposites. This approach allowed developing a binder-free asymmetric supercapacitor, which delivers an energy density of 32.91W h kg−1 and a maximum power density of 284.63 kW kg−1. Yoon et al. [21] dispersed MWCNTs in a surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) solution. Then, the BC films were dipped in the solution for different immersion rates. The authors reported a conductivity of 1.4× 10−4 S cm−1. Zhou et al. [83] dispersed MWCNTs in an absolute ethanol solution at 0.05 wt% concentration to coat the BC membrane. These membranes with 13.9 wt% MWCNT achieved a maximum electrical conductivity of 1.2 S cm−1. Considering a different nanofiller, Yano et al. [106] used silica sols to immerse BC hydrogel, allowing the particles to flow to the film and lodge in the spaces between the ribbon-shaped fibrils.\nLegnani et al. [165] deposited ITO and SiO2 films onto dried BC membranes using radio frequency magnetron sputtering, to avoid heating of the substrate and thus minimization of the membrane strain. These materials can be used as a flexible organic optoelectronic device. Yang et al. [166] prepared BC/CdS hybrid nanofibers, which involves the immersion of BC fibers in ethanol and water (50:50 v/v). The next step consisted of the hydrothermal reaction of CdCl2 and ethanol-saturated BC fibers, and centrifugation leads to a uniform deposition of CdS nanoparticles, obtaining BC/CdS hybrid nanofibers. These nanofibers presented high efficiency as photocatalytic and good recyclability. Ccorahua et al. [20] presented a novel processing technique to incorporate GO into BC. Once the GO solution was poured over the BC gel, and a vacuum pump was turned on, GO was reduced by hydrazine, exposing the BC film to hydrazine vapors and forming a thin layer nanocomposite."

Some studies have reported that the inclusion of additives in the culture media promotes the formation of composites [167,168]. Saibuatong and Phisalaphong [169] added Aloe vera gel to the culture medium during biosynthesis. With the 30% v/v aloe gel supplement, the nanocomposite film displayed improved properties in mechanical strength, crystallinity, water absorption capacity, and water vapor permeability in contrast to unmodified BC films. Grande et al. [23] fabricated BC/HAp nanocomposites by incorporating a mineral phase in the static culture during the formation of cellulose microfibrils (Fig. 8). The resultant nanocomposite presented reduced crystallinity due to chemical bonds between the components that improve the chemical stabilization, and was found to be suitable for biomedical applications. Gea et al. [170] opted for the direct addition of PVA in an inoculated medium to prepare nanocomposites. The presence of PVA interrupted hydrogen bonding between cellulose fibrils, yielding a decrease in Young's modulus but an increase in ductility and work-offracture.\nGrande et al. [24] prepared BC/starch (corn or potato) nanocomposites in the presence of partly gelatinized starch granules. This methodology takes advantage of the transport process occurring during a “smart” property of starch named gelatinization, which allows the self-assembly production of the nanocomposite. Starch was placed in the culture medium before a first gelatinization step (to control the diffusion of polymeric chains into BC network). Then, the BC nanofibrils grew in the presence of starch. A final hot pressing step permitted to obtain the BC/starch films.\nThe use of water-soluble cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose and CMC enables the slight modification of the culture medium, resulting in a decreased crystallinity and crystal size, increased pore size and thermal stability. It is also known that increased pore volume and pore size via in situ modification lead to increased water holding capability and water release rate.\nA different approach to incorporate a phase during the preparation of composites involves their elaboration through the fermentation of\nGluconacetobacter xylinus in a medium containing cell wall polysaccharides from the hemicellulose or pectin families [171]. It implies reviving and then culturing Gluconacetobacter xylinus in the presence of desired hemicelluloses and pectins.\n3.2.2.2. Double-network hydrogels. Bacterial cellulose can be reinforced with activated monomers to synthesize double-network (DN) hydrogels. Nakayama et al. [129] immersed BC into a gelatin solution and then crosslinked the gelatin with N-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-N′ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), which activates the carboxyl groups of amino acids. Finally, they obtained BC/gelatin DN gel, with a mechanical strength of several megapascals and a frictional coefficient of 10−3. Chang et al. [172] prepared double network hydrogels of BC and gelatin. Alkaline treated BC was crosslinked with gelatin using transglutaminase, genipin, and EDC as crosslinking agents. They found an improvement in both mechanical strength and hydrophilic properties of BC, given that gelatin filled the pores and connected the 3D structure of BC. Additionally, the increase in the concentration of gelatin enhanced the formation of double-network structures based on gelatin, which tends to improve the properties of the composite. Hagiwara et al. [173] developed BC/polyacrylamide (BC/PAAm) double network hydrogels using N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide as a crosslinker. The material presented a tensile fracture stress of 40 ± 10 KPa (similar to ligament strength, 38 ± 10 KPa), which suggest potential for the medical field.\nNumata et al. [174] developed BC/PEG gels with high mechanical strength by forming a structure with crosslinked polyethylene glycol\ndiacrylate (PEGDA) polymer networks. The authors reported that the mechanical strength was dependent on the weight percent of crosslinked PEGDA in the gel, chain length between crosslinking points, and crosslinking density of PEGDA polymers, with fracture stress and elastic modulus up to 11.5 MPa and 12MPa, respectively. The thermo-responsiveness was preserved upon PEGDA addition, since the composite was opaque at low temperature and transparent at high temperature, as found for BC/PEG. Yasuda et al. [175] evaluated the properties of 4 double-network hydrogels, two of which were composed of BC: BC/ PDMAAm (polyacrylamide) and cellulose/gelatin. For the BC/ PDMAAm composite, the BC film was immersed in an aqueous solution of 3M DMAAm, which was polymerized in the presence of BC gel at 60 °C for 6 h. For BC/gelatin, BC was immersed in an aqueous solution of gelatin at 50 °C for one week and then immersed in 1-ethyl-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide for chemical crosslinking. BC/gelatin showed poor mechanical properties, while BC/PDMAAm resulted resistant to wear, superior in various degrees when compared with conventional hydrogels."

Soft tissue mimicking materials are of high interest for the treatment of burns, ulcerative diseases or tissue\nreplacement. PVA is a hydrophilic biocompatible polymer with interesting characteristics. It can be crosslinked with BC to form a nanocomposite that exhibits improved lifespan, biocompatibility, and excellent mechanical properties. Millon and Wan [179] developed BC/ PVA nanocomposites and evaluated their capacity to replace cardiovascular tissues. They found that BC/PVA have similar characteristics to cardiovascular tissues. Wang et al. [183] used a freezing-thaw method to prepare a BC/PVA membrane as an artificial cornea replacement. The results showed that such BC/PVA nanocomposite had high water content, high visible light transmittance, UV absorbance, good mechanical properties, and thermal stability. An interesting application involves the formation of BC/polyethylene glycol (PEG) nanocomposites [184]. These BC/PEG nanocomposites showed improved thermal and mechanical properties due to their highly interconnected structure. In addition, they exhibited good cell adhesion and proliferation properties, making them suitable for tissue-engineering and wound dressing applications.\nThe combination of BC with different additives gives rise to materials that can be used for bone and cartilage tissue engineering. HAp and collagen make up natural bone. Then, given the outstanding osteoconductivity and bioactivity of HAp, it can be applied for tissue engineering in conjunction with BC [102]. Grande et al. [23] developed BC/HAp nanocomposites by introducing CMC and a mineral phase in the culture medium. The CMC addition caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of fibers. The authors demonstrated the biocompatibility and cell viability of the developed nanocomposite using HEK cell cultures. Saska et al. [122] proposed the combination of collagen and BC, forming flexible membranes which showed osteoblastic differentiation in vitro. Palaninathan et al. [185] functionalized BC by acetosulfation, verifying cell viability, antioxidant properties, and hemocompatibility of the as-constructed composite.\nThe BC nanosized network structure can be used as a starting point for specific tasks such as bone regeneration, which require a scaffold with microsized pores. To address this problem, Bäckdahl et al. [186] placed porogen materials like paraffin wax spheres and starch of various grain sizes in the growing medium of Acetobacter xylinum. They reported that smooth muscle cells migrated to the samples with larger pores diameter. Zaborowska et al. [187] incorporated 300–500 μm paraffin wax microspheres into the BC medium to improve cell infiltration, by increasing the pore size and introducing osteoprogenitor cells (Fig. 9). Such a scaffold may be of interest for bone regeneration, and it could facilitate osteoblast ingrowth and the formation of mineralized tissue.\nA variety of natural and synthetic polymers are being developed, containing drug, growth factors, peptides, and other bioactive substances to enhance wound recovery [188]. In particular, the use of BC as a wound dressing has shown that BC-based dressings prevent moisture from evaporating and allow for drugs or other bioactive substances to maintain intimate contact with the injured area [189].\nThese properties can be achieved by modifying the specific characteristics of BC through structural changes, chemical reactions or simply the incorporation of a second phase [190]. BC nanocomposites have also been used as drug delivery systems. For instance, a dry BC film immersed in benzalkonium chloride (an antimicrobial agent) achieved a drug loading capacity of 0.116mg/cm2. Trials showed that the drug effects lasted for at least 24 h against contaminated wound flora (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) [177]. Almeida et al. [191] doped BC membranes with glycerin for topical and transdermal drug delivery applications. The glycerin presence provided a skin moisturizing effect, useful for lesions with dryness such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.\nHydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) is a well-known tablet excipient [192]. Thus, a BC/HPMC composite has been produced adding HPMC to the culture medium. The trials for using BC based nanocomposites as tablet excipients show promising results, suggesting that BC can be used for the delivery of small drug molecules. To complement this point, BC seems to be an ideal base material due to its capacity to retain water. Müller et al. [193] grafted BC with polyacrylic acid for drug delivery system. The composite showed a pH-sensitive release of BSA (bovine serum albumin, a model protein) at intestinal pH. Besides, those samples with larger pores charged more BSA."

This process produced materials with a bending strength of 425MPa and Young's modulus of 28 GPa. The bidimensional orientation of the nano-scale BC network structure can be accounted for these high mechanical properties.\nAdditionally, bacterial cellulose has been used in the development of acoustic membranes. Acoustic transducer diaphragms require high stiffness and low density to maximize the velocity of sound through them. The extremely high Young's modulus and low density that characterizes BC allow the BC-based diaphragms to reach a sound velocity of approximately 5000m/s [195].

The resulting nanocomposite had a fiber content of up to 70% and showed a small loss of transparency (less than 10%), significantly low thermal expansion coefficient and good mechanical properties compared with engineering plastics. Nogi et al. [205] prepared BC/tricyclodecane dimethanol dimethacrylate (TCDDMA) nanocomposites with different percentages of BC. They reported that the addition of 7.4 wt% of bacterial cellulose nanofibers caused light transmittance deterioration of only 2.4% but reduced the coefficient of thermal expansion of acrylic resin from 86×10−6 to 38×10−6 K−1.\nBC nanofibers were acetylated to enhance the properties of optically transparent composites of acrylic resin reinforced with the nanofibers [206]. They found that acetylation reduced the refractive index of BC and the loss in regular transmittance of the material (from 13% to 3.4% at a fiber content of 63%).

They present environmental sensitivity, i.e., response to changes in temperature, pH, luminance, chemical, and physical stimuli and other external factors. One of the most investigated thermosensitive nanogels is poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) [211]. Halake and Lee [212] used fibers of BC as nanostructures, aligned micropores as microstructures and then performed in situ UV photopolymerization to immobilize both components into a PNIPAMs network. The combination enhanced the volume transition, allowed fast water infiltration (ideal for super absorbent applications) but reduced the elastic modulus. BC whiskers/ poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-butyl methacrylate) (PNB) nanogel complexes, designated as BC/PNB, were elaborated in [213] by soapfree emulsion polymerization based on PNIPAM and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-butyl methacrylate) (PNB) nanogels. BC contributed to enhancing the poor mechanical properties of isolated PNB, yielding good biosafety. In addition, the nanomaterial retained the good thermo-sensitivity of PNB, with easy flow at low temperatures and gel formation at high temperatures, being suitable for vascular embolization interventional therapy. On the other hand, the addition of AAc makes hydrogels to become thermo- and pH-responsive. The exposure to electron-beam irradiation of BC and AAc permitted their combination at different doses [137]. The resultant hydrogel presented a macroporous structure, with pore size decreasing when increasing the AAc content and irradiation dose. They were pH-responsive, suggesting a possible application in temperature-controlled delivery."

      "text" : "The development of BC based sensors has taken advantage of its large specific surface area, the number of surface hydroxyl groups, high water absorption capacity and water holding capacity [214]. BC nanofibers have been used to cover a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) for the preparation of a humidity sensor. When the humidity of the testing chamber rose, the weight increase of BC was registered. Thus, it was feasible to fabricate a simple, highly stable, sensitive, and low-cost humidity sensor based on BC nanofibrous coated QCM [214]. A similar procedure allowed for preparing a formaldehyde sensor using BC and QCM [215], coating BC with PEI. The hydroxyl groups of BC and the amide groups of PEI permitted the formation of hydrogen bonds. The nanofibrous BC/PEI network was successfully used for the detection of formaldehyde, with PEI acting as the detective material. The sensor exhibited good reversibility, reproducibility and a linear relationship with the increase of formaldehyde concentrations (concentration range of 1–100 ppm at room temperature).\nWang et al. [216] reported a different approach for the preparation\nof a BC/Au sensor. They performed the synthesis of gold nanoparticles in a suspension of BC. Heme proteins such as horseradish peroxidase, hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb) were successfully immobilized on the surface of the BC/Au surface. The immobilized heme proteins showed electrocatalytic activities to the reduction of H2O2 in the presence of the mediator hydroquinone (HQ). The amperometric hydrogen peroxide biosensor prepared showed biocatalytic activity with good sensitivity, low detection limit and fast response to hydrogen peroxide. Wang et al. [217] followed a similar procedure to develop a BC/Au glucose biosensor."

Phisalaphong et al. [218] dissolved 3 wt% BC in an aqueous solution made of 4 wt% NaOH and 3wt% urea. Then, the BC slurry was cooled at −5 °C for 12 h, later centrifuged at 10 °C for 30min. The solution was then mixed with a 3 wt% sodium alginate solution and finally coagulated in 5 wt% CaCl2 and 1% HCl solution. Although the mechanical properties of BC-based composite decreased, the degree of swelling in water improved. Since it exhibits a homogeneous nanoporous structure, chemical stability, and water absorption capability, the authors proposed its use for separation processes. He et al. [219] explored the adsorption capacity of BC/silica, built by vacuum infiltration. The material exhibited superelasticity and recyclable compressibility, hydrophobicity with a contact angle of 152°, oil binding capacity of 10 times its weight and an oil-retrieving capacity.\nDubey et al. [220] developed a BC/chitosan membrane in order to obtain the separation of ethanol/water azeotrope (EtOH/H2O). In contrast to the blend of PVA and chitosan (which dissolve at high water concentration), the BC/chitosan membrane remained unchanged. Also, it showed better thermal stability, dimensional stability, and superior mechanical properties. Choi et al. [162] prepared BC/AAc (acrylic acid) nanocomposite membranes with ion-exchange capacities."

      "text" : "Food industry also takes advantage of BC, since it can form hydrogels with good rheological properties. It is feasible to perform the BC growth medium modification to give flavor, color, texture, and shape to cellulose produced by the bacteria, making it usable in food.\nBC is a type of dietary fiber, which offers benefits to the digestive\nhealth and decreases the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [221]. Similarly, it can be used as an additive to produce low-calorie food. Lin et al. [222] processed BC with an alkali treatment, increasing its water-holding capacity. The resultant composite (designated as alkaline treated-nata) was added to surimi, finding that the BC properties were appropriate for its use as a fat replacement and an additional dietary source. Chau et al. [223] found that the administration of BC to hamsters decreased the concentrations of serum triglyceride, serum total cholesterol, and liver cholesterol, being considered as an alternative for gelatin or similar products. Okiyama et al. [224] have analyzed the effect of BC on the rheology of food. They found that BC, unlike xanthan gum, prevents the precipitation of cocoa in chocolate drinks by trapping it in the microfibrillar mesh, acting as an excellent suspending agent. BC also improved the mechanical properties of pasty condiments by reducing its stickiness. BC can be used as a stabilizer for ice cream since it can be considered similar to the commonly used gum for the same purpose. BC has also been used in tofu body-reinforcement. Tofu's fragility is a big problem for its transportation; however, with a minimum percentage of BC, its mechanical properties improved significantly.\nAlso, bacterial cellulose has found applications in smart and active packaging. Bacterial cellulose-based edible antimicrobial films were developed using bovine lactoferrin as the active component [225]. These functionalized films reduced the viability of E. coli and S. aureus, and were proposed for being used in direct contact with highly perishable foods. Jipa et al. [226] developed BC based films incorporating sorbic acid (SA) as an antimicrobial agent. Monolayer films, prepared using powdered BC (BCP) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), were coated with BC membrane to obtain multilayer films. Tests indicated that both SA and BCP concentration influenced sensitivity to water, release rate and antimicrobial ability of mono and multilayer films. Using E. coli - one of the most important pathogens for testing antimicrobial properties of films, they reported a diffusion coefficient for the antimicrobial agent of 10–12m2 cm−1 for monolayer films, being higher than for multilayer ones. Also, the SA concentration and the water solubility of the films influenced the effectiveness of the antimicrobial properties [226].\nKuswandi et al. [227] immobilized methyl red onto a bacterial cellulose membrane by the absorption method, to develop a novel sticker sensor. The relationship between the color change of the sensor and storage time of chicken followed a similar trend, suggesting a possible application for assessing chicken cuts' freshness. Similarly, it was reported that a BC/curcumin membrane responded with visible color changes to volatile amines released during fish spoilage [228] and\nthat bromophenol blue/bacterial cellulose worked as a color indicator for assessing the freshness state of the guava fruit [229]. In the same line, Pourjavaher et al. [230] developed bacterial cellulose-based pH indicator by immersing the films in an anthocyanins solution extracted from Brassica oleracea. BC-diluted anthocyanins films demonstrated a high pH-responsive behavior when exposed to pH 2–10."

      "text" : "The combination of BC with conductive nanomaterials can lead to the development of devices used for energy storage applications. The ability of BC to catalyze the precipitation of palladium generates structures with a high surface area. In that sense, the BC/Pd materials can have applications in electronic devices [231]. BC was found to be suitable for the construction of polyelectrolyte membranes and fuel cell development. Yang et al. [73] used platinum to develop BC/Pt using an in situ chemical-reduction method, obtaining a catalyst with high electrocatalytic activity. By doping the BC films with proton acid, the matrix proton conductivity increases notably, indicating the BC availability to be explored as membrane in fuel cells.\nIn addition to mechanical strength, the materials used for energy devices should exhibit flexibility for technological applications. Thus, the development of electrically conductive and stretchable membranes is of special interest. Pyrolyzed bacterial cellulose, composed of interwelded ultrathin carbon nanofibrils, can be an alternative to produce a mechanically robust three-dimensional conductive network [232]. Pyrolyzed BC/polydimethylsiloxane pellicles were produced using BC as a precursor. These exhibited an electrical conductivity of 0.2–0.41 S cm−1, maintaining their electromechanical properties when subjected to high tensile and bending strain [233].\nConstructing asymmetric supercapacitors based on BC is feasible. Chen et al. [164] developed a supercapacitor by coating BC pellicles with MnO2 (BC/MnO2) to act as the positive electrode and then coating BC with nitrogen to act as the negative electrode using a green approach. The device was reversibly charged/discharged, delivering an energy density of 32.91Wh kg−1 with high cycling stability."

      "text" : "The cellulose synthesized by the Gluconacetobacter bacteria has been used to develop a model for plant cell walls [234–236]. Furthermore, it is feasible to use BC to study the plant cell expansive growth. Initially, researchers presumed that the plant cells growth occurred due to the presence of a wall loosening agent, but not due to the cellulose network by itself. Based on their work with bacterial cellulose, Torres et al. [237] noticed that the BC network presents certain mechanical properties that offer a satisfactory explanation to the wall stress relaxation phenomena (which gives rise to plant cell growth). They suggested that the wall stress relaxation was determined by the cellulose network itself but not for a wall loosening agent. That is, BC displays reversible stress softening and stress recovery, which is consistent with the behavior of plant cells when growing, since the cells remain unaltered for a given range of internal pressure until reaching a critical threshold, after which they expand. This behavior can also explain the mechanical “safety mechanism” under stress reported for plant and animal cells which preserves their existence [237]."

      "heading" : "5. Conclusions and remarks",
      "text" : "Bacterial cellulose emerges as a versatile material for future applications in various areas. Its availability, 3-D network structure, excellent mechanical properties, and the ability to host reinforcements to achieve synergistic and superior properties have opened the possibility of more constant and extensive uses.\nWe have shown how the use of different nanofillers (conducting polymers, metal, graphene, ceramics, and bio-materials of nanometric\ndimensions) lead to the improvement of one or several characteristics of BC-based nanocomposites, such as mechanical properties, degradation ratio, water absorption uptake, electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and optical characteristics. Bacterial cellulose presents a nanosized 3-D structure, and some fillers can also have nanometric dimensions. The interaction between these two phases can be described as an interaction between two nanometric supra-molecular structures. The resultant composite can be regarded as an all-nano or nano-nano material.\nIn addition, many practical procedures can be used to elaborate these all-nano composites. Based on them, this review has proposed a classification that takes into consideration the final state of the BC matrix after the incorporation of the reinforcements. They can be classified into two clearly identifiable clusters: disturbed or undisturbed network methods. The former generally involves the use of a disintegrated BC network or single BC fibrils, which require the incorporation of a second phase to form the composite. The latter keeps intact the original BC matrix, taking advantage of its structural properties and finally blending it with reinforcing nanoparticles. Despite the difference, both methods involve BC interaction with various fillers, as well as reinforcement of synthetic polymers with BC nanofibers. Furthermore, the undisturbed network methods can be sub-classified in turn into bottom-up and top-down approaches. Bottom-up approaches usually consist of making an initial modification to the culture medium of the Acetobacter bacteria, adding the nanoreinforcements. As the 3-D matrix is formed, the nanoparticles will be incorporated automatically. Top-down approaches imply the incorporation of the nanoreinforcements on the bacterial cellulose 3-D matrix already formed, using capillarity or in situ polymerization to absorb them.\nBC nanocomposites have found a variety of applications in several areas. Their porosity, nontoxic biocompatibility, water holding capacity, and high strength make them suitable for applications including but not limited to high strength materials, catalytic materials, optical materials, sensors, wound dressing, bone tissue engineering, food applications and energy storage, among others, which were explained in detail in this review. In consequence, BC turns out to be a functional material with advantageous properties already tested for technological and day-to-day applications. The development on a large scale and therefore the generic use of these nano-nano composites is still a pending aspect, and it is expected that due to its low impact on the environment and health, in the midterm it will be a fulfilled objective."

Its biocompatibility and remarkable mechanical properties have promoted scientific interest for its use in a variety of applications including biomedical, electrical, among others. However, it is the possibility of incorporating nanosized materials into the coherent 3-D network structure displayed by BC what has propelled multiple investigations on the development of BC nanocomposites for different applications. Here we report the different methods and techniques used so far for the BC nanocomposites production. We have focused on the processing techniques that allow the incorporation of functional nanoreinforcements, nanofillers and additional phases without disturbing the original network structure, leading to the formation of nanomaterials. Processing methods, resulting structure-property relationships and potential applications of these novel nanocomposites are discussed and showcased as a fair example of integrated design and manufacture of materials.",
