Sutherland, Fatemeh Rafii⁎\nDivision of Microbiology, National Center for Toxicological Research, FDA, Jefferson, AR 72079, USA\nA R T I C L E I N F O\nKeywords: Biofilm Streptococcus mutans Nano-hydroxyapatite Polysaccharide Glucosyltransferase\nA B S T R A C T\nObjectives: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) on biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans, which is actively involved in the initiation of dental caries. Design: The effects of nHA on growth and biofilm formation by S. mutans were investigated in two media: a saliva analog medium, basal medium mucin (BMM); and a nutrient-rich medium, brain heart infusion (BHI); in the presence and absence of sucrose. Results: Sucrose enhanced the growth of S. mutans in both media. In the presence of sucrose, nHA enhanced bacterial growth and biofilm formation more in BMM medium than in BHI.\nnHA also affected the transcription of glucosyltransferase (gtf) genes and production of polysaccharide differently in the two media. In BHI medium, the transcription of all three gtf genes, coding for enzymes that synthesize soluble and insoluble glucans from sucrose, was increased more than 3-fold by nHA. However, in BMM medium, only the transcription of gtfB and gtfC, coding for insoluble glucans, was substantially enhanced by nHA. Conclusions: nHA appeared to enhance biofilm formation by increasing glucosyltransferase transcription, which resulted in an increase in production of insoluble glucans. This effect was influenced by the growth conditions."

      "text" : "Dental caries is initiated by formation of a microbial biofilm, which is a cluster of organized bacterial cells, on a tooth surface (Gibbons, 1989). Streptococcus mutans is considered an important bacterium in the initiation of dental caries (Colby & Russell, 1997). As a part of the oral microflora, S. mutans is exposed to saliva and nutrient-rich foods and produces acids and polysaccharides from dietary carbohydrates (Colby & Russell, 1997; Walker, Brown, & Taylor, 1984). The extracellular polysaccharides (glucans) that it produces for adherence to the tooth surface may facilitate the adherence of other pathogenic bacteria (Bowen & Koo, 2011; Krzysciak, Jurczak, Koscielniak, Bystrowska, & Skalniak, 2014). They provide a suitable microenvironment in the plaque biofilm as well as a mechanically stable shelter for bacteria that is hard to remove (Bowen & Koo, 2011). Organic acids produced by bacterial metabolic activities in the plaque biofilm may dissolve hydroxyapatite, a major constituent of tooth enamel (Hannig & Hannig, 2010; Pepla, Besharat, Palaia, Tenore, & Migliau, 2014). This may result in enamel demineralization and initiate the development of dental caries (Gao et al., 2016). The plaque biofilm also reduces bacterial exposure to therapeutic agents (Zhang et al., 2015).\nIn S. mutans, glucans are synthesized from sucrose by three different glucosyltransferases (GtfB, GtfC and GtfD) (Bowen & Koo, 2011; Hamada & Torii, 1980; Mattos-Graner et al., 2004; Ooshima et al., 2001; Vacca-Smith & Bowen, 1998). The Gtf enzymes of S. mutans are virulence factors that, in addition to utilizing carbohydrates to generate acidic conditions causing tooth demineralization, also produce the polysaccharides required for the formation of biofilms (Loesche, 1986; Yamashita, Bowen, Burne, & Kuramitsu, 1993; Vacca-Smith & Bowen, 1998). Because of the role of Gtf enzymes in biofilm formation, various compounds have been examined for their influence on the transcription of gtf genes (Jeon et al., 2009; Vahid-Dastjerdi et al., 2016; Wunder & Bowen, 1999; Yabuta et al., 2018; Yoo & Jwa, 2018) to find out if they can be used as an alternative approach for the prevention of cariogenic biofilms (Ren, Chen et al., 2016; Ren, Cui et al., 2016).\nThe gtfB, gtfC and gtfD genes code for production of the proteins GtfB, GtfC and GtfD, respectively. GtfB synthesizes an insoluble glucan with α-(1–3)-glycosidic linkages, which binds to the bacterial surface and also has other glucan-binding domains (Mooser & Wong, 1988; Vacca-Smith & Bowen, 1998). GtfD produces a water-soluble glucan with α-(1–6)-glycosidic linkages (Vacca-Smith & Bowen, 1998). GtfC produces both soluble and insoluble glucans and also absorbs to\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.archoralbio.2019.104484 Received 20 December 2018; Received in revised form 20 June 2019; Accepted 16 July 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author.

The insoluble glucan adheres to other bacteria and solid surfaces via GtfB and GtfC (Bowen & Koo, 2011; Mooser & Wong, 1988; Vacca-Smith & Bowen, 1998). This results in clustering and cohesion of bacteria to form plaque biofilm. Stable biofilm is formed when the ratio of GtfB:GtfC: GtfD is 20:1:4 (Vacca-Smith & Bowen, 1998; Ooshima et al., 2001). By concentrating protons on the cell surface of S. mutans, glucans may also allow the cells to adapt to acid stress (Guo, McLean, Lux, He, & Shi, 2015).\nBecause demineralization of hydroxyapatite in enamel by acids, including those produced by bacteria in the plaque, is important in the development of dental caries, nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) has been used in toothpaste for remineralization of enamel (Huang, Gao, Cheng, & Yu, 2011; Pepla et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). In addition to enamel demineralization by bacteria, host factors, including saliva, and diet influence the development of dental caries (Faustova et al., 2018; Gupta et al., 2013). In the current study, we have examined the effect of nHA on the growth and biofilm formation of S. mutans in two different media that simulated saliva and a nutrient-rich environment."

Triplicate wells contained BMM or BHI with equal amounts of inoculum with 0, 1, or 5% nHA (0.5 and 2.5 mg/ml) and 0 or 1% sucrose in a total volume of 500 μl. Sterile control wells with the same components were not inoculated.\nFor measuring the kinetics of growth, the plates were first incubated for 3 h in the anaerobic chamber (85% N2, 10% CO2 and 5% H2) at 37 °C. Next, the wells were overlaid by 5 drops of heavy mineral oil (Macron Fine Chemicals) and the plates were transferred to a Synergy Mx spectrophotometer (BioTek) for further incubation. The kinetics program of the BioTek spectrophotometer (Gen 5) was programmed to measure the optical density of the samples at 600 nm every 30min at 37 °C for 24 h. The effect of nHA on the growth of S. mutans was measured by monitoring the absorbance during growth with 0, 1 or 5% nHA in the presence and absence of 1% sucrose.\nIn duplicate experiments, 48-well plates were incubated at 37 °C in an anaerobic chamber incubator. For detecting the effect of nHA on the pH of the cultures, a solution of bromocresol green (BCG, 1mg/ml) was added to the wells.

The cells that had formed biofilms at the bottoms of the wells were dislodged using a cell scraper. All planktonic and biofilm cells were removed by pipetting. The cultures were sonicated in a FS3 Sonicator (Fisher Scientific) at 40 kHz for 5min and then vortexed at maximum speed for 20 s (Cheng et al., 2013). BHI agar plates were inoculated with bacterial cultures, using a Spiral Plater WASP2 (Microbiology International) and incubated at 37 °C inside the anaerobic glove box for the growth of bacterial colonies. The CFUs were either counted directly or calculated using a Protocol 3 colony counter from Microbiology International.\n2.5. Detection of the effect of nHA on biofilm formation by MTT staining\nThe effect of nHA on biofilm formation by S. mutans was assayed by measuring the formazan produced from the reduction of MTT by live cells in the biofilm (Liu et al., 2017). Cultures of S. mutans, prepared in 48-well microtiter plates in the presence and absence of 1% sucrose and 5% nHA and grown for 24 h, were used. As controls, duplicate wells without bacteria were included. During growth, the GTF enzymes produce polysaccharides from sucrose and mediate the attachment of polysaccharides and nHA (if present) to the surface of S. mutans, resulting in cell clustering and formation of biofilms in the wells. For colorimetric measurements of the cells in the biofilm that were formed in each well, the contents of the wells were removed. Next, 1 ml of PBS (pH 7.4) was added to each of the wells. The plates were agitated with gentle shaking, after which the buffer was removed and the plates were inverted to drain all of the liquid. Next, 0.5 ml of MTT solution (0.5 mg/ ml of MTT in PBS buffer, pH 7.4) was added to each of the wells. The plates were incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 0.5 h. During incubation, the soluble yellow MTT was reduced by the live cells in the biofilm to the insoluble purple formazan.\nAfter the formazan had been produced, the MTT staining solution from each of the wells was totally removed and replaced with 400 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The plates were incubated again at 37 °C to allow the solubilization and extraction of formazan. The DMSO, containing formazan, was removed from the wells and the absorbance of formazan was measured at 570 nm by a Synergy Mx spectrophotometer (Li et al., 2018). The amounts of formazan produced in different wells of plates containing S. mutans, treated and untreated with sucrose and nHA, were reflective of the numbers of live cells present in the biofilms."

      "text" : "The effects of nHA and sucrose on the transcription of glucosyltransferase genes in S. mutans were measured by comparing the gene expression in bacteria grown with and without nHA in the presence and absence of 1% sucrose. S. mutans cells grown in BMM and BHI, with and without 5% nHA (in BMM) or 3% nHA (in BHI) and sucrose, were used for RNA extraction.\nBecause of the high viscosity of cultures of S. mutans in BHI medium containing 5% nHA and 1% sucrose, the efficiency of RNA extraction was very low. To improve the yield of RNA, 3% rather than 5% nHA was used for extraction of RNA from BHI cultures. The bacteria were harvested at the mid to late logarithmic phase (4–7 h) and centrifuged at 5000 x g. The pellets were suspended in an RNA protection reagent (QIAGEN) and incubated for 15min at room temperature. 15mg/ml of lysozyme and 1.7mg/ml of proteinase K were added to the pellets, which were then incubated for 1 h at 40 °C. The samples were mixed with MicroBeads (MoBio) and homogenized for 5min in a Bullet\nBlender homogenizer (Next Advance). The RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit and RNAse (QIAGEN) according to the supplier’s instructions. Primers used for qRT-PCR (Table 1) were either those published for gtf genes (Stipp, Goncalves, Hofling, Smith, & Mattos-Graner, 2008) or designed using DNA STAR software. The RNA extracted from S. mutans cultures, grown in BMM and BHI with and without nHA and sucrose, was used to synthesize cDNA by using Superscript™ III FirstStrand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen). SYBR® GreenER™ qPCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) was used to perform qRT-PCR for comparing the effects of sucrose and nHA on gene transcription. 1 ng of the cDNA template was used in 10 μl of reaction mix containing SYBR® GreenER™ qPCR SuperMix and 2 μM of each forward and reverse primer (Ponchel et al., 2003).\nA CFX96 real-time thermocycler (Bio-Rad) was programmed as follows: 50 °C for 2min, 95 °C for 8.5min, to inactivate uracil DNA glycosylase and activate DNA polymerase, and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s, for amplification of cDNA. Melting curves were monitored at 65–90 °C (0.5 °C increase per 5 s) to detect nonspecific gene amplification. For normalization of cycle threshold, 1 ng of cDNA of a 16 S rRNA gene of equivalent size was amplified (Park & Rafii, 2018). As controls for excluding genomic DNA contamination, reaction mixtures were prepared without reverse transcriptase. Reaction mixtures without templates or cDNA were also included as controls to insure lack of contamination by chromosomal DNA. Triplicate assays were performed on RNA extracted from each of three different cultures. The relative levels of expression of each of the genes with respect to 16 S rRNA were determined using the cycle threshold 2−ΔCT method (Ponchel et al., 2003). The relative levels of expression of RNA for each gtf gene, from samples treated with nHA, sucrose or both, were compared to RNA from samples grown with media without either one, by calculating the fold increase using the 2−ΔΔCT method to determine the effect of nHA and sucrose on transcription (Park & Rafii, 2018) following the Real-Time PCR Application Guide from Bio-Rad."

Water (200 μl) was added to each well, followed by 150 μl of concentrated H2S04, and mixed well. The plates were incubated at room temperature with gentle shaking until all the samples became homogenized. Next, 120 μl of 5% phenol was added to each of the wells and the plates then were incubated at room temperature for 10min. The absorbances were measured at 490 nm by the BioTek spectrophotometer.

      "text" : "The kinetics of the growth of S. mutans in BMM and BHI media, with or without nHA and sucrose, is shown in Fig. 1. The highest increases in A600 in both BMM (Fig. 1A) and BHI (Fig. 1B) were detected in cultures grown with 5% nHA and 1% sucrose, in which the optical density increased during the first 12 h of incubation. It then remained at a steady state in BMM medium (Fig. 1A) but continued to increase in BHI medium (Fig. 1B). In the presence of 1% sucrose, 1% nHA enhanced the culture optical density to a lesser extent (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nThe effect of nHA on cell survival was also measured by determining the CFU of cultures grown with and without nHA after 24 h incubation (Table 2). There were more viable cells in cultures containing both 5% nHA and 1% sucrose than in cultures with either sucrose or nHA alone (Table 2). This effect was more pronounced in BMM medium than in BHI medium. BHI medium, which contains glucose, supported the growth of S. mutans better than BMM medium (Table 2). The addition of 5% nHA or 1% sucrose did not affect bacterial survival in BHI medium, but when both sucrose and nHA were added, survival increased in both BMM and BHI cultures (Table 2).\nIn BMM cultures containing 1% sucrose alone, there was a reduction of CFU, which could have resulted from a decrease in pH of cultures due to metabolism of sucrose. This was shown by monitoring the absorbance of bromocresol green (Supplementary Fig. 2) and measuring the culture pH. The pH of overnight cultures of S. mutans grown in BMM medium containing 1% sucrose was 4.5, in contrast to pH 4.8 in BMM cultures containing 1% sucrose and 5% nHA. Cell free supernatants of S. mutans grown with sucrose and 5% nHA supported the growth of S. mutans better than supernatants of S. mutans grown in sucrose alone (Supplementary Fig. 3). The increase of CFU in the presence of sucrose\nand nHA corresponded to increases in rate of growth and turbidity of cultures grown with both sucrose and nHA (Fig. 1).\n3.2. Effect of nHA on biofilm formation\nThe effect of nHA on the formation of biofilms by S. mutans grown with and without sucrose was shown by MTT staining (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4). More formazan was released from biofilms in the cultures grown with 1% sucrose and 5% nHA than in the other cultures (Fig. 2). nHA enhanced biofilm formation in BMM medium more than in BHI. Increased biofilm formation was also visualized in the microtiter plates by the higher intensity of the purple color of formazan in the wells before destaining (Supplementary Fig. 4). The purple color indicated the viable cells in the biofilm, since planktonic cells had been removed. Duplicate wells without bacteria did not\nproduce detectable amounts of formazan."

      "heading" : "4. Discussion",
      "text" : "The activities of S. mutans glucosyltransferases result in the production of polysaccharides important for biofilm formation and generation of acidic conditions for the initiation of dental caries (Loesche, 1986; Vacca-Smith & Bowen, 1998; Yamashita, Bowen, Burne, & Kuramitsu, 1993). In this study, it was shown that nHA enhanced the transcription of all of the gtf genes. This resulted in an increase in polysaccharides and formation of biofilms in the presence of sucrose, especially in BMM medium. Previously it has been shown that sucrose upregulates the transcription of gtf genes in S. mutans (Hudson & Curtiss, 1990). Our study showed that nHA enhanced the transcription of gtfB, gtfC and gtfD differently in S. mutans grown in BMM and BHI media with sucrose. In BMM medium, the presence of nHA resulted in the enhanced transcription of gtfB and gtfC, which encode enzymes mainly producing insoluble glucans, more than that of gtfD, which encodes an enzyme producing soluble glucans (Bowman & Koo, 2013). In BHI medium, nHA produced a higher increase in the transcription of gtfD. This is consistent with previous reports (Walker et al., 1984;\nWiater, Pleszczynska, Prochniak, & Szczodrak, 2012) that variation in growth conditions affects the number and proportion of glucans with α(1–3) and α-(1–6) glycosidic linkages produced by S. mutans, which reflects the relative activities of the glucosyltransferases. The optimum ratio of the three different glucosyltransferases produced by S. mutans is important for stable biofilm formation (Ooshima et al., 2001; VaccaSmith & Bowen, 1998). Deletion of gtfB and gtfC reduces extracellular matrix production and biofilm formation (Yamashita et al., 1993). The different effects of nHA on the transcription of gtf genes in BMM and BHI were reflected in the production of insoluble polysaccharides. The insoluble polysaccharide produced in the bottom of the wells in BMM medium containing both nHA and sucrose was 60% more than the amount produced with sucrose alone. In BHI medium, this difference was only 28%. This is consistent with previous findings that increases in the transcription of gtfB and gtfC produce more insoluble glucan (Bowen & Koo, 2011).\nIncreases in insoluble polysaccharide synthesis in cultures containing nHA and sucrose were correlated with a rapid increase in culture turbidity during kinetic analysis. GtfB binds to bacterial surfaces, GtfC has high affinity for hydroxyapatite, and GtfD has low affinity for hydroxyapatite (Vacca-Smith & Bowen, 1998). In the cultures containing nHA and sucrose, increased binding of glucosyltransferase to polysaccharides, nHA and bacterial surfaces resulted in increased biofilm biomass, due to the assembly of a polysaccharide-rich matrix and the development of 3D architecture (Xiao et al., 2012). The amount of biofilm formed by S. mutans in BMMmedium with nHA and sucrose was 42% higher than that formed in the same medium with 1% sucrose alone, but in BHI medium it was only 9.5% higher.\nOur finding of enhanced transcription of gtfD and a lower increase in biofilm formation in BHI medium is consistent with the finding (Freedman, Birked, & Granath, 1978) that glucan synthesis-defective mutants that had diminished virulence synthesized more of the highly branched α-(1–6)-rich extracellular glucan than the wild type. The higher amount of biofilm formed in BMM indicates higher transcription of gtfB and gtfC. Water-insoluble polysaccharides with α-(1–3) glycosidic linkages, produced by GtfB and GtfC enzymes, provide the matrix necessary for biofilm integrity and for bacterial growth and survival (Li & Burne, 2001).\nThe increase in biofilm formation on the hydroxyapatite-covered pegs of MBEC plates incubated in BMM medium with nHA and sucrose, in comparison with pegs exposed to sucrose alone, indicated that nHA was a stimulatory factor for the higher number of surviving cells bound to hydroxyapatite-covered pegs. Mucin, which promotes binding of hydroxyapatite and S. mutans (Kishimoto, Hay, & Gibbons, 1989), was present in all of the wells.\nPreviously it was reported that nHA-coated surfaces did not inhibit the growth of oral Streptococcus spp. during 24 h incubation (Abdulkareem et al., 2015). We showed that nHA in a saliva analog culture medium (BMM) enhanced biofilm formation and survival of S. mutans and also increased the culture pH during sucrose metabolism.\nTransmission electron microscopy analysis has shown that nHA has increased surface area because of nano-sized holes in the particles (Abdulkareem et al., 2015). Guo, McLean, Lux, He, & Shi (2015) showed that glucans concentrate protons on the cell surface of S. mutans that trigger tolerance to acid stress. It is possible that increased biofilm formation by S. mutans in BMM medium containing nHA with sucrose not only resulted from an increase in the production of GtfB and GtfC but also from a higher surface area for attachment of glucans to nHA and bacterial surfaces. This may have resulted in the upregulation of the acid tolerance response in microcolonies (Guo et al., 2015).\nIt has been shown (Li & Burne, 2001) by using gtfBC promoters fused to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and measuring the expression of the gtfBC-cat fusion, that the transcription of gtfBC is influenced by carbohydrates and environmental pH. We found that nHA affected the pH of the cultures and also influenced gtf transcription. The transcription of gtf genes in S. mutans is governed by regulatory genes (Biswas & Biswas, 2006; Stipp et al., 2013; Senpuku et al., 2018). At this time, it is not clear whether this was related to the effect on pH. Although various factors may be involved in the increase in biofilm formation observed in our study, it appears that enhanced transcription of gtf genes resulted in the increased production of enzymes involved in biofilm formation. Whereas gtfB and gtfC are arranged in one operon, gtfD is not linked to the gtfBC locus (Li & Burne, 2001). It appears that the transcription of gtfD was stimulated by nHA in BHI more than in BMM.\nnHA, in addition to binding glucosyltransferases, can bind to other proteins (Pepla et al., 2014). It is not known if nHA interacts with regulatory proteins in S. mutans. An increase in proliferation of periodontal ligament cells in the presence of nHA has been attributed to the effect of the autophosphorylation of a receptor and activation of signalregulated kinases (Kasaj et al., 2008). Stimulation of two-component bacterial signal transduction systems (sensor kinase and response regulator) resulting in gene expression also has been shown to affect gtf genes in S. mutans (Biswas & Biswas, 2006).\nThese in vitro experiments have provided the first data to elucidate the influence of selected factors on the interaction of nHA with S. mutans and biofilm formation without interference from other factors in the complex oral environment. In the oral cavity, there are many other factors, including the oral microflora, influencing the activities of individual species. Further research is needed to understand the in vivo effect of nHA on the bacteria involved in dental diseases."

      "heading" : "5. Conclusion",
      "text" : "The enhancement of biofilm formation by nHA in S. mutans cultures that was observed may be the result of increased transcription of gtf genes, causing increased production of glucosyltransferases that function in polysaccharide synthesis. This may lead to the generation of higher amounts of GtfB and GtfC bound to glucans, cell surfaces and nHA to constitute biofilms. The reasons for enhanced transcription of gtf genes, which may be related to gene regulation, merit investigation. Understanding the effects of nanomaterials on microorganisms that induce biofilm-related oral diseases is important for the appropriate use of these compounds.\nFunding\nNone.\nEthical approach\nNot applicable.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nNone to declare."

Design: The effects of nHA on growth and biofilm formation by S. mutans were investigated in two media: a saliva analog medium, basal medium mucin (BMM); and a nutrient-rich medium, brain heart infusion (BHI); in the presence and absence of sucrose. Results: Sucrose enhanced the growth of S. mutans in both media. In the presence of sucrose, nHA enhanced bacterial growth and biofilm formation more in BMM medium than in BHI. nHA also affected the transcription of glucosyltransferase (gtf) genes and production of polysaccharide differently in the two media. In BHI medium, the transcription of all three gtf genes, coding for enzymes that synthesize soluble and insoluble glucans from sucrose, was increased more than 3-fold by nHA. However, in BMM medium, only the transcription of gtfB and gtfC, coding for insoluble glucans, was substantially enhanced",
