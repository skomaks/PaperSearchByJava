However, the challenges of poor kinetics, unsuitable thermodynamic properties, large volume change during hydrogen sorption cycles have greatly hindered the practical applications. Here in this review, our recent achievements of a new research direction on Mg-based metastable nano alloys with a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice structure are summarized. Different with other metals/ alloys/complex hydrides etc. which involve significant lattice structure and volume change from hydrogen introduction and release, one unique nature of this kind of metastable nano alloys is that the lattice structure does not change obviously with hydrogen absorption and desorption, which brings interesting phenomenon in microstructure properties and hydrogen storage performances (outstanding kinetics at low temperature and super high hydrogen capacity potential). The synthesis results, morphology and microstructure characterization, formation evolution mechanisms, hydrogen storage performances and geometrical effect of these metastable nano alloys are discussed. The nanostructure, fresh surface from ball milling process and fast hydrogen diffusion rate in BCC lattice structure, as well as the unique nature of maintaining original BCC metal lattice during hydrogenation result in outstanding hydrogen storage performances for Mg-based metastable nano alloys.

The great advantages of hydrogen energy are very high energy density (120 MJ kg 1 for lower heating value (LHV) or 142 MJ kg 1 for higher one) and clean products from hydrogen energy and fuel cell technologies-electricity, heat and clean water. To widely realize the hydrogen energy society, however, one key and enabling part would be realization of economical and high hydrogen capacity storage technologies. It is well known that solid-state materials can chemically store atomic hydrogen inmetals, alloys or complex and chemical hydrides, etc. based materials with a much closer hydrogen to hydrogen distance, which means much greater hydrogen density in materials, when compared with storage in molecular hydrogen by compressed gas storage or cryonic temperature liquid hydrogen storage. Among these solid-state materials, Mg-based materials have widely received great research attention [5e8] due to the high hydrogen storage capacity (7.7 mass% for MgH2), great abundance of Mg element in the earth's crust (2.3 mass%) and low price of metal Mg (about 2e3 USD$kg 1). This makes the MgH2 with a rather high energy density around 9.2 MJ kg 1 (or 2.6 kWh$kg 1, 13.3 MJ L 1, and 3.7 kWh$L 1, calculated from LHVofhydrogen) anda great potential as future energy storage materials.\nFor the possible applications of onboard, portable and stationary energy storages [4,9,10], however, several challenges are existing in both kinetic and thermodynamic properties (for onboard storage), as well as the limited hydrogen capacity of Mg-based materials for system building and these should be conquered. For kinetics issue, usually a temperature higher than 500 K is needed for Mg based materials in micrometer scale to absorb hydrogen and it may take hours for the absorption and desorption processes to complete even at this temperature [10]. For thermodynamics, which is important for onboard storage, one of the main technical requirements is desorption of around 0.1 MPa hydrogen at temperature below 373 K. Nevertheless, this is not a must for the cases of heat storage or large-scale stationary hydrogen storage of Mg-based materials since in these occasions, the working temperature may be higher than 500 K. Hydrogen storage capacity is also an important parameter we should pay attention to. The reason is that even pure Mg is with a hydrogen capacity (7.7 mass%) greater than 5.5 mass% [11], in order to improve the kinetics and sometimes to modify the thermodynamics, some necessary additives and/or catalysts\nwith no hydrogen storage capacity will be introduced into the materials, not to mention that the 5.5 mass% density requirement is for system not the material itself. Therefore, enhancement of the kinetics, sometimes tailor of thermodynamics (for onboard application), and improvement in the hydrogen capacity in these materials are highly desirable. To achieve these goals, a great number of methods have been developed for storage development. These include novel synthetic techniques (ball milling [12e30], thin film synthesis [4,31e35], hydrogen plasma synthesis [36e49], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [50e52], melt spinning [53e56], severe plastic deformation [57,58], etc.), composition design (alloying [12,59e62], substitution [47,63e67], nonstoichiometry [68e71], and composite formation [30,72e79], etc.), additives with catalytic effects [80e86], amorphization [87e89], nanoconfinement [90e94], etc.\nOne of the authors and his collaborators, have tried different nano processing techniques (physical technique, chemical synthesis and mechanical method) for hydrogen storage research [4e6,10,43,95e99]. One of the new research directions on Mg-based hydrogen storage development which Shao and his collaborators initially started and intensively explored is synthesis of metastable nano alloys for hydrogen storage [25,27,100e104]. Different with other metals/alloys/complex hydrides etc. which involve significant lattice structure and volume change derived from hydrogen introduction and release, one unique nature of Mg-based metastable nano alloys is the lattice structure does not obviously change during hydrogen absorption and desorption [4,100,102,105,106]. This brings interesting phenomenon in microstructure properties and hydrogen storage performance (outstanding kinetics at low temperature and potential of super high hydrogen storage capacity). Through development of MgeCo based metastable nano alloys with a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice structure, we reported Mg50Co50 and Mg55Co45 metastable BCC alloys and these alloys can absorb hydrogen with a hydrogen storage value of 2.67e3.24 mass% at 258 K ( 15 C), which is the lowest temperature reported in literature for Mg-based materials to absorb hydrogen to our best knowledge [4,102]. These MgeCo BCC alloys possess a potential to absorb about 20 mass% hydrogen from geometrical aspect, although it is not possible to completely achieve this value up to date. Here in this paper, we summarize our previous research advances in synthesis results, morphology and microstructure characterization, formation evolution mechanisms, hydrogen storage performances and geometrical effect understanding of Mg-based metastable nano alloys for hydrogen storage. This work may open a new gate to development of next-generation hydrogen storage materials.\nSynthesis results\nFig. 1 (a) presents XRD curves of 5 representative Mg-based metastable nano alloys after mechanical alloying for 100e200 h under Ar atmosphere [27,102,103]. All of these 5 samples show almost single BCC lattice phase without obvious diffraction peaks from the starting materials of Mg, Co, Ni, B or other new phases. From the very broadening of the diffraction peaks, it is expected that the alloys are with very fine nanocrystallite structure. The Mg50Co50 BCC alloy was also analyzed or characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to see more clearly about the local microstructure [100] and it can be seen that the Mgbased BCC nano alloys synthesized by milling technique compose of BCC crystalline phase and amorphous area. For this type of Mg-based alloys, researchers have reported\nsimilar structures and amorphous phase is claimed for their synthesized alloys in their reports [70,107,108], but through different milling approaches. Here, we claimed BCC structure in these alloys and this is not mainly from XRD curves, but from electron diffraction pattern analysis (will be discussed in the next part) and high resolution TEM observations. Some neutron diffraction analysis has been carried out by Kim et al. to see more detailed local structure [109e111]. When we compare the two Mg60Ni5Co32B3 BCC alloys synthesized in different pots, we can see that although both of these two metastable alloys show BCC lattice, their XRD diffraction peaks look a little different. The one synthesized in Pot B shows more obvious diffraction peak of (200) at around 2 theta ¼ 60 , while this peak of the Mg60Ni5Co32B3 BCC alloy synthesized in Pot A hardly can be seen. Lattice parameter of the BCC alloys was calculated by Rietveld analysis (Fig. 1(b)) and confirmed by electron diffraction pattern analysis. The lattice parameter of the Mg60Ni5Co35 metastable nano alloy is 0.3094(1) nm with a very good fitting (S ¼ 1.21). It is very interesting that these two Mg60Ni5Co32B3 BCC alloys show a little different lattice parameter of 0.3120(1) nm for the one in Pot A and 0.3068 (1) for the one in Pot B. This slight difference in lattice parameter for these two alloys even with same composition and same lattice structure could greatly affect their hydrogen absorption capacity from geometrical effect aspect, which will be discussed later.\nMorphology characterization\nThe utilization of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and TEM techniques make it possible to well characterize the size and morphology, to determine the phase and composition, and to understand formation and reactionmechanisms when one investigates Mg-based materials [112]. Fig. 2 presents the bright-field and dark-field TEM, SEM and electron diffraction images of three Mg-based metastable nano alloys (Mg50Co50, Mg50Ni50 and Mg60Ni5Co35) [27,102,103]. The SEM image of Mg50Co50 indicates very homogenous particle size for the BCC alloy after the ball milling and the particle size is around 1e3 mm. From the TEM images, we can see that the one BCC alloy particle consists of a lot of small nanocrystallites with a uniform grain size of around a few nm. This size is in good agreement with the one calculated from the peak broadening of the XRD curves. From the radiuses of the electron diffraction rings of these three samples (named R1 to R6), it can be found that these radiuses are in good accord with Eq. (1):\nR1 2: R2 2: R3 2: R4 2: R5 2: R6 2 ¼ 1: 2: 3: 4: 5: 6 (1)\nThis means that these samples may be indexed to BCC lattice structure, which agrees with XRD patterns and Rietveld analysis results.\nFormation mechanism\nTo clarify the formation evolution mechanisms of MgeCo metastable BCC alloys by themechanical alloying process, the Mg50Co50 samples started from Mg and Co (Hexagonal Close\nPacked structure (HCP)) metal powders were ball milled from 0.5 to 400 h (0.5, 2, 5, 10, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300 and 400 h) and characterized by XRD and SEM techniques, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. In Fig. 3, the maximum reflection peak heights have been adjusted and normalized to clearly show the evolution process during milling for different time. In the first 10 h, XRD peak intensity reduction of Mg phase is clearly observed compared to the ones of Co. The reflection peaks are getting broadened indicating reduction in crystallite size. After 25 h milling, Co phase with Face Centered Cubic (FCC) structure is formed. From 25 to 40 h, the Co phase with HCP structure transforms into FCC one. After 45 h, the MgeCo BCC metastable alloy appears. During 45e75 h, the MgeCo BCC alloy and the Co FCC phase coexist, and the sample presents only BCC phase after 100e400 h milling.\nInformation obtained by SEM and TEM observations about the size and shape maybe is similar, but TEM provides more like 2D image information while SEM may show 3D one [112]. The SEM technique offers a possibility to clearly observe morphology of the particle surfaces. In Fig. 4, SEM images of the MgeCo alloys by SE signals give information about 3D\nmorphology and the ones by BSE provide more about composition difference in the surface [106]. From these images, we can see that the sample milled for 0.5 h is just mixture of large Mg particles and small Co ones. The SE and BSE images of the 2 h sample show that the Co particles are homogeneously dispersed on the surface of Mg ones. During 5e10 h, Mg particles are cracked to small ones due to the strong fracturing impacts of the milling process. After 25 h milling, the uniform contract indicates well mixing of Mg and Co phases at least on the particle surface. From 25 to 50 h, mean size is dramatically reduced from tens of mm to a few ones. BCC phase becomes the main phase after 50 h milling. From 75 to 400 h, the particle size is not further reduced with milling durations.\nCombining the XRD and SEM results, the formation evolution mechanism of Mg50Co50 BCC alloy can be summarized as:\na Started from mixture of large Mg particles and small Co\nones, firstly, Co is dispersed on surface of Mg particles with the milling.\nb Secondly, large Mg particles are cracked to small pieces by\nmilling fracturing force; small Co particles stick on the surface of large Mg ones. c Thirdly, after 25 h milling, Co phase with FCC structure\nappears; Co particles become dissolved into Mg ones.\nd Fourthly, from 25 to 40 h, three phases-Mg, Co-FCC and Co-\nHCP coexist in the sample; particle sizes decrease significantly with longer milling. e Fifthly, the MgeCo BCC alloy is formed after 45 h milling;\nthe BCC phase and Co-FCC phase coexist until 75 h.\nf Sixthly, from 100 to 400 h, particle size of BCC phase is not\nfurther reduced. However, the morphology of the BCC samples changes with the milling time.\nHydrogen storage properties\nFig. 5 presents the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement curve of Mg50Co50 andMg50Ni50 metastable BCC nano alloys under hydrogen atmosphere of 4 MPa, and up to 773 K. The DSCmeasurement for theMg50Ni50 sample consists of two heating and cooling cycles. The one for the Mg50Co50 alloy is at a heating/cooling rate of 10 K/min and just one heating/cooling cycle. For the Mg50Co50 alloy, during the heating step, there are two very sharp exothermic peaks (459 and 481 K). The first one is attributed to hydrogen absorption of the Mg50Co50 BCC alloy and this can be confirmed when the DSC measurement is stopped between the first exothermic peak and the second one, and measured the XRD pattern.\nThen only BCC structure can be found from the XRD curve. This also indicates that after the first hydrogen absorption by the Mg50Co50 metastable alloy, BCC is kept in the hydride metal lattice according to reaction (2):\nBCC (Mg50Co50) þ H2 / BCC-Hx (2)\nThe second exothermic peak at 481 K is due to hydrogen absorption of the BCC hydride and then formation of mainly Mg2CoH5 and Co phases, and a small amount of MgCo2. That was verified by XRD measurement of the sample after the second exothermic peak of the DSC measurement. This reaction may be expressed as:\nBCC-Hx þ H2 / Mg2CoH5 þ Co þ MgCo2 (3)\nThe endothermic peak at 766 K during heating is ascribed to hydrogen desorption of the Mg2CoH5 phase and the exothermic peak at 717 K during cooling is hydrogen absorption of the formed MgxCo phase. These two reactions can be expressed as:\nMg2CoH5 4 H2 þ MgxCo (4)\nThe exothermic peak at 450 K is attributed to transformation of the high temperature (HT) phase of Mg2CoH5 to low temperature (LT) one [113], which is expressed as:\nMg2CoH5 (HT) / Mg2CoH5 (LT) þ Q (5)\nThe peaks of the DSC measurement of the Mg50Ni50 BCC alloy in the first heating and cooling cycle are similar with the ones in the Mg50Co50 sample, although the peak positions are different. The first two exothermic peaks are hydrogen absorption of the BCC alloy and the BCC hydride and the second one at 554 K includes phase formation of Mg2NiH4 and Ni, as well as small amount of MgNi2 phases. This can be expressed as:\nBCC-Hx (Mg50Ni50Hx) þ H2 / Mg2NiH4 þ Ni þ MgNi2 (6)\nThe endothermic peak at 744 K in the first cycle and the exothermic peak at 693 K in the first cooling cycle are desorption of the Mg2NiH4 phase and rehydrogenation of the formed Mg2Ni phase, respectively. This pair of reactions can be expressed as:\nMg2NiH4 4 H2 þ Mg2Ni (7)\nThe exothermic peak at 494 K in first cycle, the endothermic peak at 506 K in the second heating step, and the exothermic peak at 495 K in the second cycle are attributed to the transformation peaks between HT and LT phases of Mg2NiH4 (Eq. (8)).\nMg2NiH4 (HT) / Mg2NiH4 (LT) þ Q (8)\nThe peaks at 748 and 693 K in the second cycle are with the same attributions of the ones at 744 and 693 K in the first one. From the DSC measurements of the Mg50Co50 and Mg50Ni50\nmetastable BCC nano alloys under 4 MPa hydrogen atmosphere, we can conclude that these metastable alloys may keep BCC metal lattice structure after hydrogenation until around 470 K (for Mg50Co50) and 550 K (for Mg50Ni50).\nFig. 6 demonstrates hydrogen kinetics of Mg50Ni50, Mg50Co50, Mg60Ni40, Mg40Ni60 BCC nano alloys and Mg67Ni33\nnano alloy with Mg2Ni structure at different temperatures in 3.3 MPa hydrogen without any activation process [4,27]. All of these five samples may absorb hydrogen at 303 K (30 C for Mg50Co50) or 373 K (100 C for other samples). The Mg67Ni33 nano alloy with Mg2Ni structure absorbs 1.15 mass% at 373 K (100 C) after 1 h absorption, which is a significant\nimprovement compared to common Mg2Ni alloys which usually need a temperature high than 500 K even after activation. This is due to the nanostructures and fresh surfaces of the sample from ball milling. For the other BCC alloys, the\nMg40Ni60 alloy absorbs hydrogen with a lowest speed and it shows a capacity of 0.31% after 1 h absorption at 373 K. This capacity is lower than the nanostructured Mg67Ni33 alloy with aMg2Ni structure. Also it is much lower than other BCC alloys, which is thought to be related to its lattice parameter and geometrical effect. This will be discussed later. The Mg50Ni50 and Mg60Ni40 BCC alloys absorb hydrogen with a capacity of 1.79 and 1.47%, respectively. Among these Mg-based nano alloys, the Mg50Co50 alloy shows the best kinetics and highest capacity (2.17%) after 1 h absorption even at a lower temperature of 303 K. Here these BCC alloys may absorb hydrogen at much low temperature (303e373 K) compared to commonMgbased alloys and the mechanism is thought to be related with the nanostructure, fresh surface produced from ball milling, as well as the BCC structure of the lattice. It is reported that the hydrogen diffusion speed in metals of BCC lattice can be a few orders of magnitude faster than in FCC or HCP ones [114].\nIn Fig. 7, the PCI curves of the different MgeNi and MgeCo nano alloys in different conditions [27,106]. Similar to the hydrogen absorption properties in Fig. 6, the Mg40Ni60 BCC alloy shows the smallest hydrogen absorption content (0.91 mass%). It is lower than the Mg67Ni33 nano alloy (1.64%) with Mg2Ni structure, similar to the hydrogen absorption measurements. The other MgxNi100-x nano alloys with BCC structure showmuch higher capacity-1.75% for Mg60Ni40 and 1.85% for Mg50Ni50. When we compare the capacities of Mg50Co50 alloy with Mg50Ni50 one, we may find that the Mg50Co50 metastable nano alloy with BCC structure is with much better performance. It can absorb hydrogen at much lower temperature with high hydrogen capacity (2.07% at 373 K, 2.42% at 303 K and 2.67% at 258 K). The absorption temperature of 258 K ( 15 C) is the lowest temperature reported for Mg-based materials in literature. Nevertheless, the desorption process of these alloys shows an incomplete hydrogen release, which is a not good status for Mg-based BCC structure metastable nano alloys and should be addressed before the real applications of these Mg-based metastable nano alloys.\nFig. 8 presents XRD curves of one Mg50Co50 BCC nano alloy before and after PCI measurement. From it, it can be seen that\nafter the PCI cycle, there is no obvious change in the XRD curves and peak position. Since during the hydrogen desorption process at temperature below 373 K,most of the hydrogen cannot be released out, this means BCCmetal lattice structure remains in the hydride. This also agreeswith the discussion in the DSC part (Fig. 5). This is also one of the reasons that we name this type of alloys “metastable ones”. We know in BCC lattice, each metal has 6 tetrahedral sites and 3 octahedral sites for possible hydrogen occupancy, three times asmuch as in FCC or HCP lattice. Thismeans BCC lattice ismore favorable for hydrogen storage development. However, most of the BCC latticemetals and alloyswill form into other type of structures (mostly FCC), then it will lose the advantage of three times of hydrogen interstitial sites for hydrogen occupancy or storage. Therefore, in our metastable BCC nano alloy case, the unique\nnature of maintaining BCC metal lattice is of great merits for development of future high capacity hydrogen storage materials.\nFig. 9, the schematic of formation mechanism of relatively stable metastable phase explains how we adopt mechanical alloying method to synthesize Mg-based metastable alloys. Very interestingly, the unique nature of the relatively stable metastable alloys can be obtained through formation of extremely large amount of defects and plastic deformations during the milling process. The synthesized metastable alloys may present almost no obvious lattice structure and even parameter change after insertion and extraction of hydrogen atoms, which is never reported in other metal, alloy or complex and chemical hydride systems. The advantages of this unique nature of our relatively stable BCC nano alloy include:\n1. No obviously volume change during hydrogen absorption\nand desorption processes, whichmakes the materials easy to be efficiently packed for system design. 2. These metastable nano alloys present great hydrogen ab-\nsorption kinetics at low temperature due to the homogeneous particle size in a few micrometers and crystallite size in a few nanometers. 3. Keeping BCC metal lattice also means three times\nhydrogen interstitial sites for possible hydrogen occupancy compared to FCC or HCP ones.\nFurthermore, the lattice and the nanostructure in the Mgbased metastable alloys may resist a temperature up to 600 C (results not shown in this work), and this superior stability in lattice structure may bring superior electrochemical performance for these metastable alloys as battery electrode materials.\nFig. 10 presents the correlation relationship and the geometrical effect study between hydrogen absorption capacity and the lattice parameter of the Mg-based nano alloys with BCC structure. These BCC lattice nano alloys include the ones in our previous work [25,27,100e103,106] and it should be reminded that these alloys are synthesized by mechanical alloying from elemental raw materials (Mg, Co, Ni, B, etc.) in different conditions (starting compositions, milling pots,\nmilling durations, etc.) and the hydrogen absorption capacities are derived from PCI measurements of these samples at different temperatures (mostly 303 or 373 K). Even that, from Fig. 10, it seems there is an optimum lattice parameter range at 0.300e0.305 nm for Mg-based metastable nano alloys with BCC structure for hydrogen absorption, which well explains the result in Figs. 8 and 9 that Mg-based BCC alloys with same or similar composition but different lattice parameters may show completely different hydrogen absorption capacities.\nConclusion and prospect\nIn comparison with FCC and HCP lattices, the BCC one is more promising for hydrogen storage development because each metal in BCC structure is with 3 times the interstitial sites (octahedral and tetrahedral ones) for possible hydrogen occupation. However, the stability of the BCC lattice structure during the hydrogenation remains challenge due to most of the BCC structure metals/alloys will lose the BCC structure and transfer into FCC or HCP structure during hydrogenation process and then lose the outstanding hydrogen storage potentials. The metastable nano alloys synthesized by mechanical alloying method initially started and intensively explored by Shao and his collaborators perfectly solved the above problem. Large amounts of defects and plastic deformation introduced during ball milling result in the fabricated Mg-based metastable nano alloys with BCC lattice possessing the unique nature of maintaining the original lattice structure with hydrogen absorption and desorption.\nIn this review, the authors summarized various Mg-based metastable nano alloys with BCC lattice structure. These nano alloys are homogeneously with a particle size of 1e3 mm and a crystallite size of around a few to tens of nanometers and with large amounts of defects and plastic deformation. Among those metastable nano alloys, the most impressive one is the MgeCo based metastable nano alloys. The ball milled Mg55Co45 metastable BCC alloys may even absorb hydrogen with a hydrogen capacity of around 3.24 mass% at 258 K ( 15 C), which, to our best knowledge, is the lowest temperature reported for Mg-based materials in literature. Moreover, the detailed formation evolutionmechanism of the Mg-based metastable nano alloys by mechanical alloying method is well illustrated and help the readers have a deep understanding of the good hydrogen storage performance of the metastable nano alloys. The ball milled Mg-based metastable nano alloys also exhibit us good hydrogen storage performance because of the fresh surface, nanostructure produced from ball milling process and the fast hydrogen diffusion rate in BCC lattice structure, which make these BCC alloys could absorb hydrogen at much lower temperature compared to common Mg-based alloys. In addition, geometrical effect has a deep influence for the hydrogen absorption. It seems the lattice parameter should be controlled in the range of 0.300e0.305 nm for the best hydrogen storage performance and this result shows us a new direction for the Mg-based metastable BCC nano alloys with good hydrogen storage performance. Nevertheless, the potential to absorb about 20mass % hydrogen from geometrical aspect of these metastable BCC nano alloys does not achieve up to date and need further\ninvestigation. And the incomplete hydrogen release in desorption process also needs to be addressed before the real applications. One possible approach could be design and development of BCC metastable alloys with larger lattice parameters so that the hydrogen occupancy distance in the materials may be larger than 0.21 nm, according to a semiempirical rule for minimum hydrogen to hydrogen distance in interstitial hydrides. Overall, the Mg-based metastable nano alloyswith BCC lattice structures bymechanical alloying present us the fast hydrogen storage kinetics and good structure stability during hydrogenation and dehydrogenation process, whichmay open a new direction to development of next-generation hydrogen storage materials.\nAuthor contributions\nH.S. conceived and designed the concept.

    "abstractText" : "Mg-based materials have been widely researched for hydrogen storage development due to the low price of Mg, abundant resources of Mg element in the earth's crust and the high hydrogen capacity (ca. 7.7 mass% for MgH2). However, the challenges of poor kinetics, unsuitable thermodynamic properties, large volume change during hydrogen sorption cycles have greatly hindered the practical applications. Here in this review, our recent achievements of a new research direction on Mg-based metastable nano alloys with a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice structure are summarized. Different with other metals/ alloys/complex hydrides etc. which involve significant lattice structure and volume change from hydrogen introduction and release, one unique nature of this kind of metastable nano alloys is that the lattice structure does not change obviously with hydrogen absorption and desorption, which brings interesting phenomenon in microstructure properties and hydrogen storage performances (outstanding kinetics at low temperature and super high hydrogen capacity potential). The synthesis results, morphology and microstructure characterization, formation evolution mechanisms, hydrogen storage performances and geometrical effect of these metastable nano alloys are discussed. The nanostructure, fresh surface from ball milling process and fast hydrogen diffusion rate in BCC lattice structure, as well as the unique nature of maintaining original BCC metal lattice during hydrogenation result in outstanding hydrogen storage performances for Mg-based metastable nano alloys. This work may open a new sight to develop new generation hydrogen storage",
