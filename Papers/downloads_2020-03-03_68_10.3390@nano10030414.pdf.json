      "text" : "Quantum dots sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are emerging innovations for photovoltaic cells as a replacement for the ideal dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The maximum efficiency of 13.4% obtained from inorganic sensitizer [1] has led many scientists to the research on fabricating better photosensitizes. That can portray a good generation of multiple excitons [2,3], panchromatic characteristics [4], and photostability [5] that will deal with the shortfall of molecular dyes in the traditional DSSCs. The fabrication of quantum dots (QDs) sensitizer materials to enhance this kind of solar cells has gained ground due to their diversity [6,7], tunable band-gap, cost-friendliness, and easy fabrication. QDs size can be controlled to obtain optimum band gap, as well as incorporate other semiconductor QDs materials as co-sensitized to enhance their photospectral properties and increase the conversion efficiency of QDSSCs (as seen in Figure 1) [8–10]. Moreover, the challenges involving metal-oxide surface and the absorbers poor contact due to the inabilities of photoinduced charge separation to directly penetrate each other served as a major restriction [11].\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 414; doi:10.3390/nano10030414 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 414 2 of 10\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 10\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration of quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) working procedure involving, quantum dots (QDs) photosensitizer, counter electrode, photoanode, and electrolyte [12].\nOther limitation like electrons diffusion length and the electrode nanoporous oxide geometry [12], hinder the surface area optimum adsorption capacity of molecule dye. To increase the cell spectral properties by adopting various photosensitizers will lead to poor optical density [13]. This implies that the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the cells are linked directly to the nanoporous surface area of the electrodes. To solve this shortfall, nanoporous oxide can be separated from absorbers by injection of electrons to improve better overlap with the solar spectrum and higher optical density without destroying the electron absorption performance [14–16]. This can be achieved with synthetic process, which is divided into nucleation and growth. The depth knowledge about both steps has resulted in new nanosynthesis route. Giving a better uniform surface morphology, size and monodispersity materials by enabling optimum control on the synthesis process. Factors, such as solvent, reducing agent, and capping agent, are of very great importance in monodisperse nanoparticles synthesis. The use of capping agents in stabilization and colloidal synthesis of nanoparticles is known to control materials size, surface passivation and particle morphology. The adoption of energy-saving and less or non-toxic capping agents will promote green synthetic route of nanoparticle fabrication of large scale commercialization [17–19]. Great consideration is placed on the choice of capping agents’ base on the proposed application, in other to cater for the particular surface, size, geometry and functional group. Change in any of the above mention can influence the characteristics properties of the materials. Capping agents, such as trioctylphophine oxide (TOPO), trioctylphophine (TOP), and hexadecylamine (HDA), etc., offer excellent stability with organic solvents for nanoparticles [20,21]. The injection of HDA capping agent could offer desirable particles size and better QDs sensitizer materials with good quantum efficiency. Therefore, enhancing the assembly patterns of the fabricated cells [22]. In the present study, the main objective is exploring the beneficial effects of both HDA capped and uncapped materials on surface treatments. Therefore, leading to improving electrochemical performance of quantum dots sensitizers’ absorber in photovoltaic cells."

Results and Discussion\nSnS/HDA and SnS sensitizers were employed to investigate the optimized electrochemical performance of both materials.

SnS sensitizer exhibited a higher area than SnS/HDA, which is preferred for higher performance abilities.\nBased on the EIS results of SnS/HDA and SnS photosensitizer, shown in Figure 4, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the SnS sensitizer film decreases compare to the SnS/HDA sensitizer with lower charge transfer resistivity. These will enhance fast electron transfer, lower charge recombination, and better conductivity compared to SnS/HDA photosensitizer. This connotes improved contact between the redox couple with SnS sensitizer and a better degree of electron growth [26,27]. By this, we concluded that SnS sensitizer offers preferable efficient electron transfer.\nBased on the EIS results of SnS/HDA and SnS photosensitizer, shown in Figure 4, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the SnS sensitizer film decreases compare to the SnS/HDA sensitizer with lower charge transfer resistivity.

The improvement in crystalline quality could be linked to nucleation control, which promotes the growth process of SnS [28]. In addition, there is no change in the preferential orientation along (201), (210), (111), (301), (311), (511), (610), and (512) for both samples, which confirms successful fabrication of SnS and SnS/HDA into the lattice of TiO2 [29]. The preferential orientation of SnS/HDA is linked to the nucleation control of the growth process due to excess HDA used during the synthesis [30].

I–V curve characteristics of SnS/HDA and SnS nanoparticles.\nThe Bode plot, as seen in Figure 7, exhibits the phase angle shift and frequency response magnitude. According to Bode plot, the phase angle of SnS photosensitizer is higher compared to SnS/HDA photosensitizer. This depicts that SnS has a porous nature (confirmed by surface area analysis and AFM image) and lower charge transfer resistance. Furthermore, this enhances the injection and flow of electrolyte in the cell [32].\nFigure 7. Bode plot spectra of SnS/HDA and SnS nanoparticles.\nThe topographical analysis was carried out using atomic force microscope (AFM). The evaluated particles size varied in the range of 0.11–1.18 um for SnS/HDA and 0.054–0.54 um for SnS films grown at 360 °C with size height of 16.8% and 8.4%, respectively, as seen in Figure 8. These images revealed little significant changes in the particles size of both samples fabricated at the same temperature. The ad-atoms move over the surface brings bonding togetherness with an enlarged form of sub-particles. This emanated to formation good compactness and larger particles size. When the film surface is smooth, it resulted to lower roughness due to high surface diffusion [33].

Acc rding to Bode plot, the phase angle of SnS photosensitizer is higher compared to SnS/HDA photosensitizer. This depicts that SnS has a porous nature (confirmed by surface area analysis and AFM image) and lower charge transfer resistance.

Bode plot spectra of SnS/HDA and SnS nanoparticles.\nThe topographical analysis was carried out using atomic force microscope (AFM). The evaluated particles size varied in the range of 0.11–1.18 um for SnS/HDA and 0.054–0.54 um for SnS films grown at 360 °C with size height of 16.8% and 8.4%, respectively, as seen in Figure 8. These images revealed little significant changes in the particles size of both samples fabricated at the same temperature. The ad-atoms move over the surface brings bonding togetherness with an enlarged form of sub-particles. This emanated to formation good compactness and larger particles size. When the film surface is smooth, it resulted to lower roughness due to high surface diffusion [33].

The diffusion of SnS/HDA and SnS photosensitizer in HI-30 electrolyte connote Warburg’s constant (W) as a result of the straight line. The SnS/HDA sensitizer displaced lower impedance compare to SnS sensitizer. XRD results for SnS/HDA and SnS photosensitizers displaced eleven peaks within the values of 27.02◦ to 66.05◦ for SnS/HDA and 26.03◦ to 66.04◦ for SnS in correlation to orthorhombic structure. The I–V efficiency obtained indicates that the SnS/HDA exhibited a better performance compared to SnS and Sn(II) sensitizers due to the presence of HDA capping agent. Bode plot results indicate that the electrons lifetime (τ) for SnS/HDA photosensitizer displaced superiority to the SnS photosensitizer, owning to their ability to enhanced electron lifetime and reduced electron recombination. The AFM results show the particle size distribution in SnS value at 357 nm with a smooth surface and good compactness on the substrate. However, the value for SnS/HDA is 122 nm displaced shape and size of non-symmetrical particles. The lattice fringes revealed polycrystalline nanoparticles comprising numerous crystal grains for both samples.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.Z.M., M.A.A. and E.L.M.; methodology, J.Z.M., M.A.A. and E.L.M.; validation, J.Z.M., M.A.A. and E.L.M.; formal analysis, J.Z.M., M.A.A, and E.L.M.; investigation, M.A.A.; resources, J.Z.M., M.A.A. and E.L.M.; data curation, J.Z.M., M.A.A. and E.L.M.; writing—original draft preparation M.A.A.; writing—review and editing M.A.A.; visualization, M.A.A.; supervision, J.Z.M. and E.L.M.; funding acquisition, J.Z.M. and E.L.M.

Change in any of the above can influence the characteristics properties of the nanomaterials. The adoption of hexadecylamine (HDA) as a capping agent in single source precursor approach offers better quantum dots (QDs) sensitizer materials with good quantum efficiency photoluminescence and desirable particles size. Structural, morphological, and electrochemical instruments were used to evaluate the characterization and efficiency of the sensitizers. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) results display both reduction and oxidation peaks for both materials. XRD for SnS/HDA and SnS photosensitizers displays eleven peaks within the values of 27.02◦ to 66.05◦ for SnS/HDA and 26.03◦ to 66.04◦ for SnS in correlation to the orthorhombic structure. Current density–voltage (I–V) results for SnS/HDA exhibited a better performance compared to SnS sensitizers. Bode plot results indicate electrons lifetime (τ) for SnS/HDA photosensitizer have superiority to the SnS photosensitizer. The results connote that SnS/HDA exhibited a better performance compared to SnS sensitizers due to the presence of HDA capping agent.",
