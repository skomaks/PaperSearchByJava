Here for the first time, we have synthesized quaker ladies flower type ZnO (ZnO/QNF) from panos extract (extract from four panax plants such as Panax ginseng, Acanthopanax senticosus, Kalopanax septemlobus and Dendropanax morbifera). The synthesized ZnO materials was characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Transmission electron microscope. The newly synthesized ZnO/QNF was applied for the removal of industrial dyes such as methylene blue (MB), Eosin Y (EY) and Malachite green (MG) under UV illumination. The photocatalyst degraded the 15mg L−1 MB, EY and MG to>99% within 80, 90 and 110min of contact time, respectively. In addition, the ZnO/QNF photocatalyst removed the low concentrated 5mg L−1 of MB, EY, and MG within 30, 35 and 40min of contact time, respectively. The pedal structure provided all the active sites available for the easy interaction with dye molecule under UV, and that enabled fast kinetics of dye degradation than the many other benchmark materials reported previously. The ZnO photocatalyst could be reused minimum of five cycles without any significant loss in degradation efficiency."

      "text" : "Owing to the increasing population and sophistication on daily life, demand on usage of variety of synthetic chemical products are become inevitable. The byproducts released by the chemical industries to the environment after the production of such synthetic chemicals causes contamination of water systems and pose a significant risk to humanity and aquatic organisms [1]. Among the many chemicals from various industries, organic dyes from textile industries are potentially toxic, indestructible, bio recalcitrant, mutagenic, carcinogenic and resistant to fading on exposure to light [2,3]. Thus, removing those industrial dye pollutants from waste water receiving immense attention among researchers to attain a toxic free green environment and to make ease the survival of living things.\nLarge number of strategies have been applied for the dye removal from wastewater such as adsorption [4], biological treatment [5,6] and heterogeneous photocatalysis [7,8]. Due to the higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the effluent, the use of microbes in biological waste\nwater treatment is limited and most dyes are toxic to the microbial cell. Nanoparticles have the potential property to adsorb the dyes efficiently because of its high surface to volume ratio and can be modified to increase their chemical affinity against targeted compounds [9]. Adsorption by heterogeneous nano-materials is also limited and severely lacks in desorption properties. Beside photocatalysis exhibit many added advantages over adsorption process. Metal oxide nanostructures such as titanium dioxide (TiO2) [10], zinc oxide (ZnO) [11,12], stannous oxide (SnO2) [13], iron oxide (Fe2O3) [14], and zirconium oxide (ZrO2) [15] have been widely applied as catalysts for the removal of organic micro pollutants in water and air by photodegradation method [16]. Although TiO2 has been the mostly used metal oxide photocatalyst for eco-friendly applications, ZnO has been suggested as an alternative low cost photocatalyst for the degradation of organic molecules in aqueous solution and it is ruling the nanobiotechnology field for the past two decades owing to their unique multifunctional nature such as high chemical stability, broad range of radiation absorption, high photostability and ability to act as a photocatalyst under UV light\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2019.111588 Received 8 May 2019; Received in revised form 20 June 2019; Accepted 8 August 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author at: Graduate School of Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Republic of Korea.

Such manufacturing methods are costly, labor intensive, hazardous to the ecosystem. Green synthesis of nanoparticles as an additional perquisite to ZnO NPs, can be an ecofriendly and rapid approach to treat waste water effluents from textile industries.\nAmple ways of synthetic routes are reported to prepare ZnO nano particles. However, green chemical methods received immense attention to the researchers and this method avoids the use of organic solvents and surfactants. Interestingly, plant extracts mediated ZnO nanoparticle synthesis exhibited defined crystal structures and efficient dye degradation [20,21]. In this regard, gawade et al., reported Calotropis procera mediated synthesis of ZnO NP for methylene orange dye degradation and showed 81% efficiency in 100min contact time [21]. Pavithra et al., reported Citrus maxima mediated ZnO synthesis for methylene blue dye degradation and exhibited 90% efficiency in 150min [22]. A. R Prasad et al., reported Abelmoschus esculentus mediated ZnO synthesis for methylene blue and Rhodamine B dye degradation and exhibited 100% efficiency in 60 and 50min, respectively [23]. Though these ZnO possessed well crystallinity but showed poor surface morphology. These reports suggesting that preparing ZnO with crystalline structural integrity and defined surface morphology could enhance efficiency of dye degradation. In addition, utilizing one plant extract did not produce any peculiar surface morphology. In an attempt to obtain ZnO nanoparticle with enhanced structural characteristics, here in this work we have chosen the Panos extract, which is the combination of four Panax plant extracts namely Panax ginseng, Acanthopanax senticosus, Kalopanax septemlobus and Dendropanax morbifera. All these plants belong to the family Araliaceae. The phytochemicals present in these plants are polysaccharides, saponins, phytosterols, essential oils, polyphenols, organic acids etc.\nIn the present study, for the first time, we have synthesized four-way pedal quaker ladies type ZnO nanoflowers (ZnO/QNF) via green route using Panos extract. Characterization of the NPs have been done using X-ray diffraction (XRD), SAED and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Methylene blue, Eosin Y, and Malachite green (MG) were chosen as model dye to check the efficacy of ZnO/QNF in dye degradation under UV light irradiation."

According to this method zinc nitrate was used as a precursor and panos plant extract was used as a reducing agent. The metal nitrate has high solubility to form homogenous solution and has higher oxidizing capability to form metal oxide nanoparticles. For synthesizing the ZnO/QNFs about 1% of panos extract was used and added with 99mL of DI water. After complete dissolution of the extract in the magnetic stirrer, 10mL of 0.15M of zinc nitrate was added drop wise to ensure homogeneous mixture of the solution. Then, the mixture is transferred to the hot plate at 85 °C with constant stirring for 30min. Then, 25mL of 2M aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was prepared and added dropwise along the walls of the flask slowly. The mixture is kept at high speed constant stirring at 500 rpm for 2 h. Then the flask is wrapped and sealed with aluminum foil and kept overnight without heating for settling down of the precipitates. The solution is centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10min at room temperature and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed with distilled water thrice to remove unreacted compounds and dried at 150 °C for 3 h in hot air oven and then calcined at 500 °C in hot air furnace under H2 gas with a gas flow rate of 0.2mL/min for 3 h."

Fig. 1 displayed the XRD patterns, showed sharp and well-defined peaks, were located at 2θ values of 31.6°, 34.3°, 36.2°, 47.5°, 56.5°, 62.8°, 67.8°, 69.0, and 76.9°, which were indexed to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112), (201), and (202) lattice planes, correspond well to the simulated XRD pattern of hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure of ZnO, according to the standard diffraction JCPDS card No. 36–1451 [26].\nThe morphologies of the hierarchical ZnO/NF structure obtained was investigated by TEM. Fig. 2a and b showed the TEM images and\nenlarged view of the hierarchical ZnO/QNF materials, respectively. The four-way leafy flower like structure had sizes around 480 nm assembled from pedals of about 240 nm in length and 120 nm in width. The SAED pattern confirms the fringe length about 0.21 nm.\nThe formation of ZnO is examined through FT-IR analysis. Fig. 3 shows the FT-IR spectra of PANOS extract, ZnNO3.6H2O and ZnO/QNF. The spectra reveal the presence of bands assigned to the oscillating vibrations νO–H (~3350 cm−1), symmetric and asymmetric valency bands νC–H (~2932; 1050 cm−1) and stretching vibrations νC=C (~1300; 1500 cm−1), νZn–OH (~900 cm−1), and νZn–O (~450 cm−1) [27,28]. The absence of Zn-(H2O) peaks and presence of Zn-O, Zn-OH (surface hydroxyl) confirms the successful formation of ZnO/QNF.\nThe ZnO/QNF structures were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 4a shows the typical XPS wide survey spectra of ZnO/QNF. Zn, O and C peaks were detected as shown in the wide survey spectra in Fig. 4a. The detected carbon binding energy (285 eV) is related to the carbon adsorbed from PANOS on the surface during the synthesis of the sample at the ambient conditions. The Zn 2p spectrum for ZnO/QNF revealed the binding energies at 1045.5 and 1022.6eV for Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2, respectively, indicating that the zinc was present in the +2 state [29,30]. The O1s spectrum (Fig. 4c) revealed that the binding energies at 529.8, 531.7 and 532.3eV for (oxygen between two Zn atoms) ZnO, Zn-OH (surface oxygen) and C]O (adsorbed from panos extract), respectively. The XPS results are in good agreement with the previous reports [29–31] and confirmed the successful formation of ZnO/QNF."

The degradation effect of MB, EY and MG were monitored in the dark (no light region) for 1 h with and without the presence of catalyst to quantify the variation in dye concentration due to surface property such as adsorption. In addition, the decomposition percentage of MB, EY and MG were also tested under UV light illumination without the presence of catalyst. The result indicated that there were no significant variations in dye concentration in both experiments (Fig. 5). All of the MB, EY and MG dye solutions were treated with ZnO/QNF NPs and subjected to photodegradation in presence of UV light. The photocatalytic degradation for MB, EY and MG were obtained by monitoring the UV–vis spectra at 10-\nScheme 1. Schematic representation of ZnO/QNF synthesis using Panos extract.\nmin intervals during the reaction. The dye degradation profiles due to the photocatalytic performance of ZnO/QNF for MB, EY and MG dyes are shown in Fig. 5a, b and c respectively.\nIt was observed that> 99% of MB, EY and MG was degraded after 80min, 90min and 110min of contact time with ZnO/QNF, respectively. In addition, the degradation was also performed at low dye concentration (5mg L−1), in which the 100% degradation efficiency was attained within 30, 35, and 40min of contact time for MB, EY, and MG, respectively (Fig. 6). From the UV absorption profile (χmax= 660 nm, MB; χmax=530 nm, EY; and χmax= 630 nm, MG), it was noted that the concentrations of the MB, EY and MG dyes declined slowly due to their photocatalytic degradation (Fig. 6b). This fast degradation is due to the radical generation by hydroxyl and hydro peroxide groups when the catalyst was irradiated by a UV-light source, is explained in detail in the mechanism part. Experiment also suggested increasing the amount of catalyst enhances the degradation capacity, due to the easy availability of active sites. However, increasing the catalyst amount> 200mg reduces the efficiency, because high amount of catalyst precipitating and thereby leading to a lack of catalytic\nsurface sites, or the turbidity by suspended particle obstruct the passage of UV light. The photocatalytic activity on dye degradation of ZnO/QNF was compared with other benchmark materials reported previously (Table 1). From the Table 1, it was noted that the degradation efficiency and kinetics are much better than many other reported articles."

      "text" : "ZnO/QNF can absorb UV light (< 390 nm) and generate electron–hole pairs [32]. Based on the obtained results and previous reports [33] one can suggest that the electron produced from the surface of catalyst react with surface adsorbed O2 to form O2% (Scheme 2). The positively charged ZnO/QNF surface and/or the O2% can react with surface adsorbed H2O to form %OH, however, the later step is mostly responsible for generation of %OH radical. The %OH is a potent indiscriminant oxidizing agent which possibly responsible for degradation of most of the surface adsorbed dye molecules. To further assess the roles of %OH active species, tertiary butanol (TBA) (1.0 mM) was used as scavenger to quench the hydroxyl active species during the degradation of dye molecules [34]. As shown in Fig. 6, the photocatalytic degradation of MB, EY and MG over the ZnO/QNF was significantly affected after the addition of TBA, indicating that %OH active species played a significant role in the photocatalytic degradation of all the selected dyes.\nIn addition, the presence of carbon from phytochemical, as confirmed by FT-IR (C]C stretching frequency, 1500 cm−1) and XPS (Carbon peak, 284.5 eV) could possibly help in the generation of %OH radical [35]. Hence the synergistic effect of carbon traces from phytochemicals and ZnO/QNF are responsible for the effective degradation of dye molecules."

The initial dye concentration and photocatalyst loading taken to investigate the reusability efficacy was 0.015 g L−1 and 4 g L−1, respectively, at pH=6.5/room temperature. The percentage of dye degradation efficiency was slightly reduced after the second and third cycles because of centrifugation as there is an effect of catalyst amount loading for self-photosensitized decomposition of MB, EY and MG in presence of ZnO nanoparticles as a photocatalyst.

Here for the first time, we have synthesized quaker ladies flower type ZnO (ZnO/QNF) from panos extract (extract from four panax plants such as Panax ginseng, Acanthopanax senticosus, Kalopanax septemlobus and Dendropanax morbifera). The synthesized ZnO materials was characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Transmission electron microscope. The newly synthesized ZnO/QNF was applied for the removal of industrial dyes such as methylene blue (MB), Eosin Y (EY) and Malachite green (MG) under UV illumination. The photocatalyst degraded the 15mg L MB, EY and MG to>99% within 80, 90 and 110min of contact time, respectively. In addition, the ZnO/QNF photocatalyst removed the low concentrated 5mg L−1 of MB, EY, and MG within 30, 35 and 40min of contact time, respectively. The pedal structure provided all the active sites available for the easy interaction with dye molecule under UV, and that enabled fast kinetics of dye degradation than the many other benchmark materials reported previously. The ZnO photocatalyst could be reused minimum of five cycles without any significant loss in degradation efficiency.",
