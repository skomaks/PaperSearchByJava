      "text" : "The present investigation deals with the size-dependent analysis of the geometrically nonlinear vibration response of micro/nano-plates with and without a central cutout made of a porous functionally graded material (PFGM) in the presence of nonlocality and strain gradient size dependencies. In accordance with this purpose, a modified porosity-dependent power-law function is put to use to estimate the effective mechanical properties of PFGM micro/nano-plates with various porosity distribution patterns. To solve the constructed nonlinear nonlocal strain gradient problem, the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS)-based isogeometric analysis is utilized as an efficient discretization technique having the capability to satisfy C-1 continuity. It is seen that for specific values of the material property gradient index, porosity index and the plate deflection, the enhancement in the nonlinear frequency due to the strain gradient size effect is more than the reduction caused by the nonlocality. Furthermore, it is found that there is a specific value of the length to thickness ratio, corresponding to which the nonlocal strain gradient frequency ratio becomes minimum. This minimum value enhances by increasing the value of the porosity index of PFGM micro/nano-plates. Also, by increasing the value of the material property gradient index, the minimum point of the nonlocal strain gradient frequency ratio shifts to a higher ratio of the length to width ratio.\nKeywords: Nonlinear dynamics; Isogeometric analysis; porosity-dependent properties; Functionally graded materials; Non-classical continuum elasticity.\n*Corresponding author.

For U-PFGM pattern, it is found that the porosity index has a uniform influence on the value of the Young’s modulus at different positions along the plate thickness, according to which, by increasing the porosity index, the value of Young’s modulus decreases. However, for X-PFGM pattern, it can be seen that the influence of porosity index on the\nYoung’s modulus becomes maximum at the mid-plane, but it diminishes on top and down free surfaces.

      "text" : "In this section, the dimensionless nonlocal strain gradient porosity-dependent geometrically nonlinear oscillations of PFGM micro/nano-plates are analyzed. It is assumed that the top and bottom surfaces of PFGM micro/nano-plates are ceramic-rich and metal-rich, respectively. The material properties are: \uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC50\n, for the ceramic phase, , = 210 \uD835\uDC3A\uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC4E \uD835\uDF08\uD835\uDC50 = 0.24, \uD835\uDF0C\uD835\uDC50 = 2400 \uD835\uDC3E\uD835\uDC54/\uD835\uDC5A3 \uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC5A = 70 \uD835\uDC3A\uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC4E \uD835\uDF08 = 0.35\uD835\uDC5A, \uD835\uDF0C\uD835\uDC5A for the metal phase [75]. Moreover, the geometric parameters are assumed as = 2700 \uD835\uDC3E\uD835\uDC54/\uD835\uDC5A3\n.ℎ = 50 \uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5A, \uD835\uDC3F1 = 50ℎ\nIn order to check the validity and accuracy of the constructed size-dependent plate model, in Table 1, the dimensionless natural frequencies of a square isotropic micro/nano-plate are obtained corresponding to various values of the nonlocal and strain gradient parameters, and are compared with those reported by Thai et al. [76]. An excellent agreement is found which confirms the validity of present computational model.\nThe variation of the dimensionless nonlocal strain gradient nonlinear frequency with dimensionless deflection for U-PFGM micro/nano-plates is depicted in Figures 6 and 7 corresponding to various values of the nonlocal parameter, and strain gradient parameter, respectively. It is found that by taking the strain gradient the size dependency into account, the nonlinear frequency of a PFGM micro/nanoplate enhances, while the nonlocality plays an opposite role and it leads to decrease it. Moreover, these enhancement and reduction in the value of the nonlinear frequency are more prominent for a lower value of the plate deflection. So, by increasing the plate thickness, the gap between different curves reduces. The predicted results have similar pattern for the both simply supported (SSSS) and clamped (CCCC) edge supports.\nIn Tables 2 and 3, the classical and nonlocal strain gradient dimensionless nonlinear frequencies of PFGM micro/nano-plates are presented corresponding to different values of the nonlocal and strain\ngradient parameters, respectively. The percentages written in the parentheses indicates the difference between the size-dependent nonlinear frequency and its classical counterpart. It can be observed that among different porosity distribution patterns, the both nonlocal and strain gradient size dependencies have the minimum and maximum effects on the nonlinear frequency of O-PFGM and X-PFGM micro/nano-plates, respectively. In addition, it is seen that for specific values of the material property gradient index and plate deflection, the enhancement in the nonlinear frequency due to the strain gradient size effect is more than the reduction caused by the nonlocality. Furthermore, by increasing the value of the material property gradient index as well as the plate deflection, the both nonlocal and strain gradient size effects on the nonlinear oscillation response of PFGM micro/nano-plates decreases. Similar observations are achieved for the SSSS and CCCC types of boundary conditions.\nIn Figure 8, the variation of the dimensionless classical and nonlocal strain gradient nonlinear frequencies with dimensionless deflection corresponding to different values of the material property gradient index is illustrated for U-PFGM micro/nano-plates with SSSS and CCCC boundary conditions. It is found that by increasing the material property gradient index, the value of the classical and sizedependent nonlinear frequencies decreases, while the slope of the variation with the plate deflection enhances. Accordingly, for a high value of the plate deflection ( ) the influence of the material \uD835\uDC64/ℎ > 0.8 property gradient index becomes vice versa, as the nonlinear frequency of a PFGM micro/nano-plate with a higher material property gradient index becomes more than that of with a lower one. This pattern is similar for the both classical and nonlocal strain gradient cases.\nTabulated in Tables 4 and 5 are the classical and nonlocal strain gradient dimensionless nonlinear frequencies of PFGM micro/nano-plates corresponding to different values of the nonlocal parameter and strain gradient parameter, respectively. The percentages given in the parentheses indicates the difference between the nonlocal strain gradient nonlinear frequency and its classical counterpart. It is revealed that by increasing the value of the porosity index, the significance of the both nonlocality and strain gradient size dependencies on the nonlinear frequency of PFGM micro/nano-plates reduces. This reduction is somehow more considerable for a lower plate deflection. Additionally, it is indicated that for specific values of the porosity index and plate deflection, the enhancement in the nonlinear frequency due to the strain gradient size effect is somehow more than the reduction caused by the nonlocality. Furthermore, it is observed that the type of boundary conditions has no influence on the introduced predictions.\nIn Figure 9, the variation of the dimensionless classical and nonlocal strain gradient nonlinear frequencies with dimensionless deflection is plotted corresponding to various porosity distribution patterns. It is demonstrated that the values of the classical and size-dependent nonlinear frequency associated with the O-PFGM and X-PFGM micro/nano-plates are minimum and maximum, respectively. However, the slopes of the variation of nonlinear frequency with plate deflection associated with the U-PFGM and O-PFGM porosity distribution patterns are, respectively, minimum and maximum. Accordingly, for the porosity index of , by increasing the plate deflection ( \uD835\uDEE4 = 0.5\n), the nonlinear frequency of an O-PFGM micro/nano-plate becomes more than that of U-\uD835\uDC64/ℎ > 0.9 PFGM micro/nano-plate. These observations are approximately the same for the SSSS and CCCC edge supports.\nThe variation of the dimensionless nonlocal strain gradient nonlinear frequency with dimensionless deflection is represented in Figure 10 corresponding to different porosity indexes and porosity distribution patterns. It can be seen that the value of the porosity index plays more important role on the nonlinear oscillation response of an O-PFGM micro/nano-plate than that of X-PFGM one. Therefore, the gap between the curves associated with the O-PFGM micro/nano-plates having different porosity indexes is more significant.\nIn Figure 11, the influence of the central cutout on the nonlocal strain gradient nonlinear free oscillations of PFGM micro/nano-plates is depicted. It is found that the central cutout causes to increase nonlinear frequency of the micro/nano-plates, and this increment becomes more significant for a bigger size of the cutout (increasing the ratio of ). However, the value of the maximum deflection does not \uD835\uDC4E/\uD835\uDC3F change the significance of the influence of a central cutout. This anticipation is similar for the both CCCC and SSSS boundary conditions.\nIn Figure 12, the variation of the nonlocal strain gradient frequency ratio ( ) with the length \uD835\uDF14\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3F/\uD835\uDF14\uD835\uDC3F to thickness ratio ( ) is depicted for PFGM micro/nano-plates with different values of the porosity \uD835\uDC3F1/\uD835\uDC3F2 index and various porosity distribution patterns. It is demonstrated that there is a specific value of the length to thickness ratio, corresponding to which the nonlocal strain gradient frequency ratio becomes minimum. This minimum value enhances by increasing the value of the porosity index of PFGM micro/nano-plates. Moreover, it is observed that by changing the porosity distribution from O-PFGM type to X-PFGM one, the minimum value of the nonlocal strain gradient frequency ratio reduces. The predictions are the same for the both SSSS and CCCC types of boundary conditions.\nThe variation of the nonlocal strain gradient frequency ratio with the length to thickness ratio is shown in Figure 13 for PFGM micro/nano-plates with various values of the porosity and material property gradient indexes. It is revealed that by increasing the value of the material property gradient index, the minimum point of the nonlocal strain gradient frequency ratio shifts to a higher ratio of the length to width ratio. In addition, it is found that by increasing the porosity index, the role of the material property gradient index on the frequency ratio associated with a specific value of the becomes \uD835\uDC3F1/\uD835\uDC3F2 more important, as the gap between the curves is more significant."

    "abstractText" : "The present investigation deals with the size-dependent analysis of the geometrically nonlinear vibration response of micro/nano-plates with and without a central cutout made of a porous functionally graded material (PFGM) in the presence of nonlocality and strain gradient size dependencies. In accordance with this purpose, a modified porosity-dependent power-law function is put to use to estimate the effective mechanical properties of PFGM micro/nano-plates with various porosity distribution patterns. To solve the constructed nonlinear nonlocal strain gradient problem, the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS)-based isogeometric analysis is utilized as an efficient discretization technique having the capability to satisfy C-1 continuity. It is seen that for specific values of the material property gradient index, porosity index and the plate deflection, the enhancement in the nonlinear frequency due to the strain gradient size effect is more than the reduction caused by the nonlocality. Furthermore, it is found that there is a specific value of the length to thickness ratio, corresponding to which the nonlocal strain gradient frequency ratio becomes minimum. This minimum value enhances by increasing the value of the porosity index of PFGM micro/nano-plates. Also, by increasing the value of the material property gradient index, the minimum point of the nonlocal strain gradient frequency ratio shifts to a higher ratio of the length to width ratio.",
