Combining two or more anti-cancer agents can reduce ADRs and nanotechnology played a pivotal role in this regard. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown the potential of flavonoids nano-formulations, especially quercetin, naringenin, apigenin, catechins and fisetin in the prevention and treatment of several types of cancer. Similarly, clinical trials have been conducted using flavonoids alone or in combination, however, the nano-formulations effect still needs to be elucidated. This review focuses on the impact of flavonoids nano-formulations on the improvement of their bioavailability, therapeutic and safety profile and will open new insights in the field of drug discovery for cancer therapeutics."

      "text" : "Cancer is the major cause of mortality across the globe and is the most critical barrier to increasing life expectancy in the 21st century [1]. Genetic and epigenetic factors could contribute to the development of tumor and its progression [2]. The population growth and aging as well as modifiable parameters such as smoking, sedentary lifestyle and western diets are all increasing the burden of cancer in developing\ncountries [3]. Conventional therapies for cancer include chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy where chemotherapy has a major concern of poor accessibility to tumor tissues. The requirement of high doses and nonselective nature of available therapeutic options are associated with a range of adverse drug reactions(ADRs) [4,5].\nPhytochemicals from different plants are the major sources of therapeutic and preventive agents against several disorders including cancer.

Among the phytopharmaceuticals, flavonoids including kaempferol, epigallocatechin-3gallate (EGCG), curcumin, apigenin, luteolin, genistein, myricetin, quercetin and silymarin, are documented to be effective against various types of cancers [7–12]. Flavonoids act as anticarcinogenic agents by inhibiting pro-carcinogens and enzymes responsible for activating procarcinogens, inactivating carcinogens and protecting DNA against oxidative stress related damage [13–15].\nAlthough they are extensively studied for their anticancer potential, but they are not thoroughly evaluated for their safety profile and some reports suggested that they may act as pro-oxidant agents in some cases and may interact with other drugs especially through enzymes biotransformation enzymes [16]. Emerging the field of nanotechnology led to the development of drug delivery systems that are selective in targeting tumor specific tissues [17,18]. Nanocarriers can modulate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of incorporating drug thus enhancing the therapeutic index of drug. Through alteration of drug biotransformation, it allows drug to accumulate especially at tumor site. Nowadays, nanotechnologies are extended to deliver two or more drugs in combination [19,20]. The current study was designed to provide the comprehensive review of literature highlighting the role of flavonoids and their nano-formulations in the treatment and prevention of cancer."

      "text" : "The application of nanobiotechnology including functions of biological components on nanoscale, to the field of medicines reveal novel molecular basis of diseases as well as drug action which helps to design new approaches to drug discovery. To improve drug discovery, pharmaceutical manufacturing and drug delivery, technical achievements have been applied in the field of nanotechnologies [21]. The nanotechnologies are used in drug discovery for different, which includes, targeted drug delivery, improving bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs, delivery of macromolecule drugs to the site of action within the cell, combining therapeutic agents with imaging techniques which may visualize the site of drug delivery and co-delivery of two or more drugs [22].\nThe technology is designed to overcome issues associated with current pharmaceuticals whether by increasing efficacy and improving drug safety profile or improving patient compliance, thus it provide superior drug delivery systems to conventional treatments [23]. Different nanostructures have been developed for designing nanoparticle drug delivery systems including liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, solid lipid nanocarriers, nano-emulsions, nano-capsules, ceramic nanoparticle and metallic nanoparticles (Table 1) [24–31].\nNevertheless, the combination therapies become more popular for the treatment of cancer by combining two or more anticancer agents in order to synergize the effect and reduce the potential toxicities of individual agents and emerging drug resistance. Nanotechnologies play a vital role in introducing successful anticancer combination drug delivery that delivers drugs to specific tumor tissues. In addition the application of controlled and targeted drug delivery systems enhances the therapeutic efficacy with improving safety profile of chemotherapeutic agents [32]. Increase in submission of new drug products containing nanoparticles to Center of Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) have been noted in last two decades with the majority of liposomal formulations intended for the treatment of cancers [33]."

These dietary polyphenols have reported pharmacological effects as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer [34,35]. Several flavonoids have showed chemopreventive effects though the inhibition of the development of new cancer cells, the prevention of carcinogens from reaching their activation sites and the decrease of the toxicity of certain compounds by inhibiting their metabolism [7,11,14]. The mechanisms involved are estrogenic/antiestrogenic activity, prevention of oxidation, anti-inflammatory activity, regulation of the host immune system, antiproliferation or apoptosis, induction of cell cycle arrest, induction of detoxification enzymes, and changes in cellular signaling [36]. However, low solubility, rapid metabolism and poor absorption of dietary flavonoids in gastrointestinal tract hinder their pharmacological potential [37]. Moreover, flavonoids complexation or precipitation enhanced when they are ingested with other food components and their degradation by microbiota reduce they stability and bioavailability [38,39]. Therefore, it is imperative to face the significant challenge associated with flavonoids pharmacokinetic properties through the development of nano-engineered systems which could considerably improve their clinical potential as broad spectrum anti-cancer agents [37,38]. These challenges are discussed below."

Phase I metabolism pathway mediated by cytochrome P450 system (CYPs) plays a crucial role in bio-transforming molecules to more polar entities and increasing the likelihood, which later works as substrates for phase II metabolism. Flavonoids have been reported to significantly inhibit the activities of CYPs [43] which can increases the half-life and the concentration of many drugs, thus increasing their adverse effects and/or toxicity [38]. Majorly, in vivo metabolism of flavonoids is dominated by phase II metabolic enzymes, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, sulfotransferases and catechol-O-methyltransferase [42,44]."

The role of microbiota on the absorption, metabolism and bioavailability remains unclear [45]. Microbiota seems to biotransform some flavonoids to smaller phenolic compounds with similar biological effects with improved bioavailability [46]. On the other hand, microbiota can extensively metabolize flavonoid via glucuronidase and sulphatase enzymes, cleaving the heterocycle break, and producing inert polar compounds that are rapidly excreted without report any reported biological effect [45,47]. Due to the diversity in flavonoids structures and microbial composition, predicting their possible interaction is bit difficult task. Moreover, various factors such as the use of antibiotics can alter microbiota and indirectly affect flavonoid bioavailability."

      "heading" : "4. Bioavailability of nanoparticles in cancers",
      "text" : "Nanomedicine represents one of the fastest growing research areas of science and is considered as one of the most promising tools for cancer treatment. Advances in materials science and protein engineering have contributed to nanoparticle-based treatment becoming a potential therapeutic approach [49]. The list of potential applications continues growing but it is important to take into consideration that to obtain the optimal therapeutic index, one characteristic that must be achieved is to increase the bioavailability of nanoparticles, so that a prolonged circulation in the blood to have more possibilities of reaching a tumor before being eliminated [50] providing greater efficacy.\nNanoparticles represent an opportunity to achieve better bioavailability and targeting strategies over free drugs [50]. Since physiological barriers as renal, hepatic or immune often hinder its effectiveness [51]. Also, depending on the route of administration of the drug, different factors at gastrointestinal tract, skin, lungs or brain [52] can limit the bioavailability of a drug. Thus, the benefit of nanotechnology provides nanocarriers which are able to cross the different biological barriers for a more effective and less toxic chemotherapy [49]. There are several factors, as discussed above that reduce the bioavailability of a drug. First, poor water solubility limits the bioavailability of a drug. The use of hydrophilic nanoparticles to encapsulate medicines may improve their solubility, in turn to improve their bioavailability in vivo and thus to allow more effective delivery [20]. Moreover, nanocarriers protect the drug from early degradation which depends on the routes of administration, being the intravenous the most used. Nanoparticles administered orally can enter the gut and pass through the liver via hepatic portal system. Then, once entering into the circulatory system, either intravenously or through other routes, nanoparticles will encounter many barriers on their long way to achieve the specific destination. Liver is regarded as the main barrier for nanoparticles administrated systemically, as up to 90% of the dose is usually sequestrated by this organ by liver by a non-specific host defence (Fig. 1) [53].\nThe mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS, before called reticuloendothelial system or RES) is the innate biophysically defensive mechanisms of the body responsible for identifying the foreign substances (nanoparticles as well as hydrophobic substances especially those coated with the opsonin protein) through a process named opsonization; then the nanoparticles are captured by monocytes and macrophages and eliminate them from the bloodstream, taking them up in the liver or the spleen, mainly liver kupffer cells [54–56]. This dramatically reduces the delivery efficiency (less than 1%) of administrated cancer nanomedicines since the active agents do not reach the desired regions in enough quantities, as most of them are sequestered by MPS [53,56]. Hence, in order to improve the anti-tumor efficacy, synthetic nanoparticles must elude clearance by the immune system and then concentrate at the tumor in adequate quantity [57,58]. As a consequence, several methods have been explored to reduce clearance by MPS [59], such as modifications of the surface of nanoparticles with ligands [50]. It has been reported that ligands such as cysteine and glutathione or poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) allow to escape from the immune system and prolong their circulation time in the bloodstream [51,60,61]. Besides, the conjugation of PEG to proteins increases protein solubility and stability, and prevents the rapid renal clearance of small proteins [62]. Furthermore, several strategies have been investigated to inhibit phagocytic clearance such as the use of peptides designed from human CD47 [63]. In addition to this, further surface modifications of nanoparticles, as ligands to overexpressed receptors, may help to redirect it to tumour cells selectively and in the specific uptake of drugs into the tumour [49]. It has also been investigated on the conjugation of ligands to eliminate non-specific uptake [20,64]. These properties would improve the efficacy of the drugs while\nreducing collateral damage in healthy tissues, leading to the need for less frequent dosing which is of great patient benefit [59,65].\nThe nanoparticles protect drug molecules from biodegradation and excretion which influence the pharmacokinetic profile of anti-cancer compounds. However, kidney filtration needs to be considered when designing nanoparticles. Levels of the nano-encapsulated drugs must be sustained in the plasma for producing a chemotherapeutic effect, as well as eliminated from the bloodstream safely to limit potential longterm adverse effects. The characteristics such as charge [66] affect the clearance of nanoparticles in kidneys. Also, the influence of size and shape of nanoparticles has also been reported. For instance, spherical nanoparticles with diameters less than 6 nm were shown to have greater renal clearance than those with diameters greater than 8 nm [27,67]. On the other hand, the polymeric protection of drugs allows a controlled release by the degradation rate of the polymer. This can be prolonged to allow the arrival to the affected tissue [68].\nBlood-brain barrier (BBB) requires special treatment for effectively availability of drugs inside the brain. The BBB is a system of vascular cellular structures, represented mainly by close junctions between endothelial cells that causes resistance to most drugs. Brain cancer is highly lethal and does not have efficient available therapies, mainly due to the BBB. It is therefore of particular interest to develop chemically modified nanoparticulate drug capable of crossing the BBB and effectively deliver the drug in brain tissue [52,69,70].\nIn summary, nanoparticles can help solve the problems of solubility and chemical stability of drug molecules, which are reported and used against cancer. Incorporating free therapeutic drugs into nanoparticles can confer them distinctive advantages such as increased bioavailability, site-specific targeting, controlled release, reduction side effects and improvement therapeutic efficacy to improve the treatment of cancer and its unwanted side effects."

      "heading" : "5. Flavonoid nanoparticles in cancer prevention [in vitro studies]",
      "text" : "Chemoprevention is intended using a variety of agents, natural,\nsynthetic or biological, to prevent the carcinogenesis process. Within the natural agents, flavonoids have shown a remarkable cytotoxic potential against tumour cells in different in vitro assays and animal models. In addition, the low bioavailability of these flavonoids greatly limits their therapeutic applicability [71]. The technological development, in this case of nanotechnology, has allowed the creation of novel formulations able to overcome the problems of bioavailability, in addition to achieving a controlled release of the bioactive compound [72,73]. In recent time, different approaches that study the effects of various nano-formulations in the prevention of cancer have increased markedly.\nThe concept of nano-chemoprevention for cancer control was introduced for first time by Siddiqui et al. [74]. In an in vitro and in vivo xenograft mice model green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) encapsulated in polylactic acid–polyethylene glycol (PLA-PEG) nanoparticles were investigated. The results evidenced that encapsulated EGCG was over 10-fold more effective than non-encapsulated EGCG against human prostate cancer cells and in reducing in the tumour volume in the xenograft mice. From this study, numerous researchers have developed different matrices including polymer nanoparticles, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) or carbohydrate matrices as drug delivery vehicles for chemopreventive flavonoid agents with promising results. Within polymers PLGA has probably been the most researched polymer, due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability, in addition to being approved by the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA). In this sense, PLGA was used to encapsulate a wide range of flavonoids and assayed for their cytotoxic effect. PLGA incorporating kaempferol was tested in the inhibition of viability of cancerous (A2780/CP70 and OVCAR-3) and normal ovarian cells (IOSE397) [75]. PLGA nanoparticles significantly reduced the viability of cancer cells with higher potency than kaempferol alone, without affecting normal cell viability. In another study, the treatment with apigenin encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticles to A375 skin melanoma exerted better apoptotic effects than apigenin alone [76]. PLGA encapsulations preserved apigenin degradation induced by ultraviolet\nFig. 1. Marked effect of nanoparticles formulation on bioavailability of encapsulated drug. Nanoparticles improve several features to achieve a better bioavailability. GI: Gastrointestinal; MPS: Mononuclear phagocyte system. Scientific studies reveal that several nanoformulations improve bioavailability of flavonoids, and their pharmacological potential more effectively than free flavonoids, some examples are mentioned.\nradiation, entered cancer cells and induced apoptosis through ROS accumulation in a mitochondria-dependent process. Chrysin loaded PLGA-PEG copolymers were found to be cytotoxic for gastric AGS cancer cells in a similar way to that shown by free chrysin [77]. Furthermore, chrysin loaded PLGA-PEG upregulated miR-34a which is involved in the P53 tumour suppressor network and downregulated in gastric cancer to a greater extent than free chrysin. The same group of researchers also evidenced a decrease in miR-18a, miR-21, and miR-221 gene expression after treatment of AGS cancer cells by chrysin loaded PLGA-PEG [78]. PLGA-PEG loaded with chrysin was also investigated in breast T47D cancer cells [79]. The encapsulation favoured the delivery and accumulation of chrysin in T47D cells and evidenced more cytotoxicity than the free drug. Luo et al., investigated the cytotoxic effects of gold-quercetin nanoparticles loaded in PGLA in cervical cancer cells (Caski, Hela and Siha cell lines) [80]. Quercetin nanoparticles suppressed Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and downstream signalling pathway and inhibited cancer cells proliferation, invasion and migration. In addition, nanoparticles induced autophagy and apoptosis promoting cell death. PEO-PPO-PEO are nonionic triblock copolymers (Pluronic® polymers) approved by the FDA with the capability of spontaneously self-assemble to form micelles and generally used as carriers of antidrug agents [81].\nIn the study of Luo et al., as mentioned above, PEO-PPO-PEO loaded with kaempferol were also investigated against cancerous and normal ovarian cells [75]. Although PEO-PPO-PEO nanoparticles were cytotoxic to cancer cells even to a greater degree than PLGA nanoparticles, PEO-PPO-PEO also reduced the viability of normal cells. The cytotoxic effects of curcumin micellar nanoparticles fabricated with non-ionic copolymer surfactant (pluronic® F-127) and the water soluble polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were evaluated against A549 and Calu-3 nonsmall-cell lung cancer cells [82]. Curcumin nanoparticles were not toxic to healthy lung cells and induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in cancer cells more efficiently than curcumin alone. In another study, the prenylated flavonoid artocarpin was loaded into PVP nanoparticles to increase its water solubility [83]. The antiproliferative effects of nanoparticles were evidenced in HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma cells by activating autophagic cell death mechanism. The cytotoxic effects of encapsulated artocapin were better when compared with free artocarpin. Aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer (Eudragit® E) nanoparticles containing silibinin and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as stabilizer agent were assayed against oral carcinoma (KB) cells [84]. Nano-encapsulated silibinin exerted higher cytotoxic effects compared to free silibinin after treating cells, partially, due to higher intracellular ROS levels in nanoparticle-treated cells.\nLiposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are other types of formulations used frequently to improve the cytosolic delivery of anticancer agents. In a study, SLNs nanoparticles were developed as a carrier for resveratrol and tested against human keratinocyte cells (NCTC2544) [85]. The nanoparticles with a size below 180 nm quickly penetrated through the membrane of keratinocytes and evidenced a remarkable S-arrest of cell cycle with diminished G2/M phase. The encapsulated quercetin into liposomes using a soybean lecithin significantly improved the solubility and bioavailability of quercetin. The formulation exerted similar or better antiproliferative effects on MCF-7 cells than free quercetin at equimolar concentrations. In another work, the chemopreventive efficacy of lipid nanoparticles containing resveratrol was evaluated in H727 bronchial carcinoma cells in vitro and ex vivo exposed to cigarette smoke condensate [86]. Liposomal nanoparticles increased resveratrol bioavailability and increased its efficacy in protecting against cigarette smoke condensate cytotoxicity. The efficacy of multifunctional SLNs with mixed cargo of cyanine-type IR-780 and baicalein or fisetin were investigated using hamster ovarian fibroblastoid (CHO-K1) and human colon adenocarcinoma (LoVo) cell lines [87]. The treatment with nanoparticles induced cytoskeletal abnormalities and increased p53 and Mn-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) expression in cancer cells. The efficiency of nanoparticles with this\nmixed cargo was enhanced when combined with electroporation since this process increases cell membrane permeability.\nOther authors have developed nanoparticles using a carbohydrate matrix as cargo for flavonoids. For example, EGCG was encapsulated into a carbohydrate matrix of gum-Arabic and maltodextrin to improve its availability [88]. This formulation significantly enhanced the cytotoxic activity of EGCG respect to free EGCG by reducing the cell viability and inducing apoptosis prostate (Du145) cancer cells. Another study encapsulated the EGCG in a nanoliposomes coated with chitosan as polysaccharide with the aim of improving the stability and an increased release and intracellular uptake of the native EGCG [89]. This nano-formulation also produced better antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in MCF-7 breast cancer cells than the treatment with non-encapsulated EGCG. Similarly, quercetin encapsulated in a pH-responsive system based on amphiphilic chitosan was evaluated in MCF-7 cells [90]. The nanoparticles containing quercetin exerted higher cytotoxic effects than both compounds alone and also evidenced suitable hemocompatibility for biological applications. In addition, quercetinloaded chitosan nanoparticles were also effective against colonic Caco2 cancer cells inducing cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and apoptotic cell death [91].\nProtein-based nanoparticles were also investigated as carriers of flavonoids to increase their solubility and delivery. Similarly, in an investigation used fisetin-loaded albumin nanoparticles to improve its bioavailability and its anticancer activity against MCF-7 cells [92]. The formulation increased the solubility and stability of fisetin and did not show significant haemolytic activity. Fisetin nanoparticles were found to be more efficient in killing breast cancer cells than fisetin alone. The cytotoxic effects of folate-conjugated albumin-encapsulated resveratrol nanoparticles were evaluated in human liver cancer cell line HepG2 [93]. The nanoparticles improved resveratrol availability and evidenced higher inhibition of the growing rate than the free resveratrol. In another study, the flavonoids genistein and icariin were adsorbed onto gelatine nanoparticles and tested against A549 cells [94]. The results reported that the percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells were higher when treating with nanoparticles than the control groups treated with non-encapsulated flavonoids.\nMetal nanoparticles, especially gold-nanoparticles, and other nonorganic nanoparticles such as silica ones are gaining much attention in nanomedicine for their potential to cause cancer cell death. In this sense, the anti-cancer effects of gold nanoparticles with morin as reducing and stabilizing agent were investigated [95]. The nanoparticles were easily uptake by MCF-7 cells and induce apoptosis, whereas were found to be compatible towards human blood cells and epithelial cell line HBL-100. Gold nanoparticles with conjugated quercetin were evaluated in hormone-dependent MCF-7and hormone-independent MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells [96]. The apoptotic activity was increased respect to free quercetin in both cell lines and also suppressed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–mediated PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signalling pathway. Similarly, researchers investigated the effects of graphene oxide–silver nanoparticles containing quercetin in human neuroblastoma cancer cells (SH-SY5Y) [97]. The nanoparticles exerted higher toxicity than graphene oxide through induction of caspase-9/3dependent apoptosis and the accumulation of autophagosomes and autophagic vacuoles. Folate tagged mesoporous silica nanoparticles as carriers for quercetin were designed to be used against breast cancer cells with over-expressed folate receptors [98]. The treatment of MDAMB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines with these nanoparticles caused cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a process mediated by the protein kinase B (Akt) and BCL2-associated X protein (Bax). The quercetin-loaded silica nanoparticles were also investigated against MCF-7 cells evidencing a significant reduction in cell bioavailability, proliferation and colony formation [99]. Finally, the toxicity of quercetin-conjugated superparamagnetic magnetite nanoparticles was investigated against MCF-7 cells [100]. Magnetic nanoparticles evidenced higher apoptosis induction in MCF-7 cells in a dose dependent manner when compared with\npure quercetin. In addition to the chemopreventive action of flavonoids encapsulated in nanoparticles, several studies have focused on the use of natural products provided in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs as a viable adjuvant therapy. Similarly, a study reported that resveratrol and curcumin co-loaded in PEO-PPO-PEO micelles ameliorated the cardiotoxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin hydrochloride (DH), but at the same time enhanced DH potency against ovarian SKOV-3 cancer cells [101]. Sabzichi et al. reported that luteolin-phospholipid nano-formulation was capable to enhance the bioavailability of the flavonoid and increased the sensitivity of human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells to doxorubicin respect to luteolin alone [102]. Luteolin nanoparticles reduced Nrf2 gene expression and downstream genes leading the cancer cell death. In another interesting work, the effects of phospholipid (lecithin) nanoparticles loaded with quercetin were assayed in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis [103]. Coexposure of MCF-7 cells with nanoparticles of quercetin and doxorubicin increased the apoptosis rate and decreased the expression of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone 1) (NQO1) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1). Quercetin-based modified (3- aminopropoxy-linked quercetin) porous silicon nanoparticles were designed to increase the anticancer effects of doxorubicin in MCF-7 and doxorubicin resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells [104]. A synergistic effect between quercetin and doxorubicin was found in both cell types by increasing the interactions and the internalization into the cells due to its similar structure with dopamine. Moreover, the combined effects of the anticancer drug gemcitabine and silver nanoparticles containing resveratrol were evaluated using human ovarian cancer cells (A2780) [105]. The combined treatment with gemcitabine and resveratrol nanoparticles inhibited the viability and proliferation and induced apoptosis in A2780 cells more effectively than both components separately.\nTo summarize, numerous evidences point out that the encapsulation of flavonoids in a wide diversity of matrices to generate nanoparticles allows a remarkable increase in their solubility and bioavailability. The administration of encapsulated flavonoid increases the cytotoxic capacity against numerous cancer cell lines with respect to the same free compound. In addition, co-administration of flavonoids with a chemotherapeutic agent increases the sensitization of cancer cells to the drug improving therapeutic efficiency."

      "heading" : "6. Flavonoid nanoparticles in cáncer [in vivo studies]",
      "text" : "Cancer therapy has been developed over last decades and flavonoids as such were found to exert anticancerigen properties; however, their limited bioavailability, poor delivery and efficacy in human are limited by their hydrophobic characteristics. New technologies have allowed the implementation of new strategies in the bioavailability of these natural compounds. Among them, different encapsulations as carriers for flavonoids have been developed lately and studied in several cancer models induced by carcinogenic drugs and xenograft models (Table 2).Main properties of flavonoid-encapsulated nanoparticles and their therapeutic effects as evidenced both in an in vitro and in vivo assays have been illustrated in Fig. 2.\nIn this sense, several studies have evaluated the effects of encapsulated flavonoids in cancerogenic animal models. In one of the experiments, quercetin was encapsulated (8.98 μmol/l of quercetin) and administrated in rats with hepatic carcinoma induced by diethylnitrosamine treatment. Orally nanoparticle-encapsulated quercetin induced the suppression of hyperplastic nodules and a minimum of preneoplastic lesions all over the parenchyma was observed. The lipid peroxidation in the liver was noticeably reduced close to normal levels by nanoparticulated quercetin, while the levels of GSH that were reduced by the carcinoma were recovered to almost normal levels in the group treated with nanoparticle-encapsulated quercetin. Encapsulated quercetin may contribute to the maintenance of membrane integrity and promote the recovery of GSH.Similarly, the increase of cytochrome\nC protein expression in the liver by hepatic carcinoma was reverted by the treatment with nanoparticles probably by the maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane fluidity since the microviscosity of the mitochondrial membrane was also protected by the nanocapsules. Additionally, the increase in serum hepatocellular (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase) and nephrotoxicity (urea, and creatinine) markers observed in carcinoma-induced animals was reduced after quercetin-loaded nanoparticles. On the contrary, free quercetin (non-encapsulated) did not offered protection in front of the hepatic carcinoma [106]. The same group also described a reduction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 expression and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 levels in rat liver, and alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, urea and creatinine decrease in serum [107]. Encapsulated quercetin could reduce the excess of ROS associated withdiethylnitrosamine metabolic biotransformation, reducing the release of inflammatory mediators and MMPs upregulation and, thus, protecting against liver damage and cancer cell formation.\nIn another study, 712-dimethyl benz(a)anthracene (DMBA) was used to induce oral squamous cell carcinoma in hamsters to study the preventive effects of the naringenin, a flavonoid containing three hydroxyl groups in its aromatic rings responsible for its therapeutic properties. Naringenin-loaded nanoparticles (50mg/kg/day) and free naringenin (50mg/kg/day) were administrated daily one week before inducing the carcinoma. Free naringenin diminished the effects of the carcinoma differentiation, while nanoparticles completely prevented the oral squamous cell carcinoma (tumor incidence, number of tumors, tumor volume and tumor burden). Moreover, Raman spectra reported a possible decrease of phospholipids in this carcinoma that could be related to a dysfunction in the stability and structure of membranes, and an increase in the levels of tryptophan and phenylalanine; these are related to inflammation and immune activation which cause a failure in the enzyme activities leading to an increased amino acids levels [108]. The tumoral tissue shows a reduction in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels, while increased GSH, GPX and vitamin E, and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, as an indicator of the proliferative activity of tumor cells) and p53 expression; this situation was reversed by naringenin being more effective the nanoencapsulation one [109]. The authors suggest that encapsulated naringenin could be accumulated into the tumor via the enhanced permeability and retention effects derived from the presence of permeable endothelial tissue surrounding the tumor and allowing effective therapeutic levels for a prolonged time.Ultra-violet B and benzo(a)pyrene were used to induce skin cancer in mice and the effects of the flavonoid apigenin (encapsulated with poly lactic-co-glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles; 3, 6 and 9mg/kg orally; and topically combined) were studied. The authors observed a reduction in the tissue damage (dermis and epidermis) and in the number of chromosomal aberrations (being the higher doses the most effective), with 28.8% of the animals free of cancer at the 90 days after the oral and topical treatment with the encapsulated flavonoid. Moreover, the expression of PCNA was down-regulated after the flavonoid treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Cytochrome C expression was up-regulated in cytosol of cancer cells but down-regulated in mitochondria after the nanoparticle-encapsulated apigenin administration suggesting that apigenin treatment might act by disrupting the mitochondrial membrane leading to the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores. ROS generation was also observed after treatments, which was related to the mitochondrial-apoptosis through modulation of apoptotic markers such as bax up-regulation and translocation to mitochondria and bcl-2 downregulation, mitochondrial matrix swelling and the subsequent activation and cleavage of downstream caspase-9 and 3. It is noticeable that the absorption of apigenin (free and encapsulated) reached a maximum point at 24 h, and the oral and topical combination of nano-apigenin showed better results [110].\nXenograft models are usually used to induce several carcinogenic\nanimal models. Chitosan nanoparticles encapsulating epigallocatechin3-gallate (EGCG) (3 and 6mg/kg orally) were used in a xenograft prostate cancer murine model (22Rν1 cells) reporting an inhibition of the tumor growth and an increased latency when compared with the free flavonoid. Moreover, prostate-specific antigen levels, as marker of prostate cancer, were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, the apoptotic process was induced in tumor tissues of mice after nanoparticles treatment as it was reflected by the increase of Bax, caspase3, -8 and -9 expression, and the reduction of the antiapoptic Bcl-2 expression, the ki-67 as marker of cell proliferation, and angiogenesis markers CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [111]. The release kinetics experimentations evidenced that the release of EGCG in simulated gastric juice was negligible and its encapsulation in chitosan nanoparticles could increase the retention time through adhesion to the mucosal surface in the gastrointestinal tract. These results agree with the obtained by Sanna and collaborators who used a mouse xenograft model of prostatic tumor; in this work the polymeric EGCG encapsulated nanoparticles (100mg/mice/day; 5 days), able to bind prostate antigens, showed a reduction in tumor size and volume and prostate specific antigen levels in serum of mice, being more effective the targeted nanoparticles than the non-targeted or free flavonoid (1mg/mice/day) [112]. Docking assays showed that polymeric encapsulation seemed do not alter the interaction with the prostate\nspecific membrane antigen active site. In addition, EGCG nanoparticles induced apoptosis in a more extent than native EGCG using the same concentrations evidenced by increased Bax and decreased Bcl-2 expressions with a significant cleavage of PARP proteins and inhibition of surviving. The inhibition of cell cycle regulatory proteins such as CDK2 and 6, cyclins A, B1 and D3 was also found in nano-formulated EGCG together with the induction of death-receptor pathway proteins [112]. The authors concluded that nanoencapsulation improved the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of EGCG as well as the active uptake.\nHuman hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2 and Huh-7) were also studied in murine models after the administration of apigenin loaded nanoparticles (20mg/kg i.v./week; 3 months). The sizes of the nodules, number and total area of hepatic lesions diminished after the encapsulated apigenin treatment. Moreover, the activities of the tumor markers cytochrome P-450, glutathione-S-transferase and UDP-glucoronyl transferase were similar to control values. Plasma and hepatic concentration of apigenin in animals treated with encapsulated apigenin were higher than the free flavonoid, agreeing with the apigenin accumulation in hepatic tissue observed by gamma scintigraphy. In all the studied variables, the apigenin loaded nanoparticles were more effective than the free flavonoid for the inhibition hepatic tumor development associated with a higher cellular uptake and a sustained release of encapsulated apigenin respect to the free form. Apigenin\nTable 2 (continued)\nNanoparticle formulation Animal model and treatment Main outcomes References\nEGCG coated in PEG-PLA nanoparticles. 22Rv1 cells implanted tumor xenograft in athymic nude mice.\nReduced tumor size and volume.

Nanoparticles exerted better bioavailability and antitumor activity than free flavonoid.\nnanoparticles were found to accumulate largely in liver and present lower clearance rate when compared with apigenin increasing the bioavailability of the drug in the target tissue [113]. Recently, fisetin into poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles were tested in rats and mice. Firstly, the authors evaluated by means of a pharmacokinetics study the delivery through the use of nanoparticle injections at several times in rats, reporting a better bioavailability of the flavonoids with increased halflife and mean residence time values. Then, the authors used a xenograft mouse model of breast cancer model (4T1 cells) to assess the antitumor efficacy of the fisetin-loaded poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles (40mg/kg i.v., 3 weeks) in mice. The results reported an inhibition of the tumor volume and tumor weight, but without body weight changes after both free fisetin and nanoparticles, which was related to low toxicity in the murine model [114]. The anti-tumoral effects could derive from fisetin apoptotic effects through inhibition of several pathways such as ERK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, blocking topoisomerase activation and NF-κB expression.\nPolymeric (chitosan) carriers for quercetin (25mg/kg i.v. twice/ week, for 4 weeks) were evaluated in tumor xenograft mice (in both A549 adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial, and MDA-MB468 human breast cancer cells), reporting lower tumor volume and tumor weight when compared with controls and free quercetin. Mice weight did not change compared between the free and encapsulated quercetin, although a significant weight loss was observed in the disease groups. Moreover, SOD activity reached normal values after treatment with encapsulated quercetin in both cancer models. The protective effect of quercetin comprises the modulation of different anticancer pathways such as cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes.Finally, the treated groups also reported a specific distribution of the quercetin formulationaddressed to the tumor cells in the in vivo model. The delivery of quercetin was improved as a consequence of leaky blood vessels and poor lymphatic drainage in the tumor surroundings favoring the nanoparticles to reach tumoral cells by enhanced permeability and retention effect [115]. A xenograft mouse model of head and neck cancer (Tu212 cells) was designed to evaluate the water-soluble polymer-encapsulated nano-luteolin (3.3 mg/kg i.p.) prevention (alternate days during 1 week before inoculating tumor cells) and 1 month after inoculation. The treatment with nanoparticles exerted significant inhibitory effects on tumor growth when compared with free luteolin. In addition, although there were no statistically significant differences in Ki-67 expression after nanoparticle treatment respect free luteolin, a clear trend within the groups was evidenced [116].The authors conclude that the limited differences between encapsulated and non-encapsulated luteolin could be magnified increasing the amount of encapsulated luteolin, or administering higher doses of luteolin via nano capsules.\nMetal nanoparticles have also been used to encapsulate flavonoids. Inhibition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process, which is an essential step in tumor metastasis (4T1 cells), and a decrease of the tumor volume and weight were reported in mice after administration of EGCG/iron nano-complexes i.v. with higher effects when combined with nanomedicine (doxorubicin), including aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase reductions in blood [117]. Also, EGCG nanocomplexes evidenced tumor specific accumulation ability and its coadministration with doxorubicin prevented cancer cells from acquiring resistance to the drugs and killed the cancer cells with high resistance to the drugs. Similar results were described with gold nanoparticles of quercetin in a breast cancer model induced by 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (DMBA) in rats (25mg/kg intra-tumor injection daily, 8 days) with tumor growth suppression and tube and new blood vessel formation [118]. The mesenchymal transition involves the activation of specific signaling networks which can be modulated by quercetin nanoparticles. Specifically, it was found that the treatment with nanoparticles inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling pathway and downstream molecules p-PI3K/Akt/p-GSK-3β [118]. Not\nonly murine models have been used in studying nanoparticles as carriers but also other models such as zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been investigated. Nanoformulation made by (+)-catechin carbon nanotubes (50 μg/ml of catechin) in zebrafish embryos xenotransplants resulted in tumor cell proliferation impairment, reduction of migration and proangiogenic phenotype inhibition when compared with control and the carrier alone [119]. These carbon nanotubes containing (+)-catechin can efficiently penetrate the cell membrane by diffusion and escape from endosomial/lisosomial vesicles.\nNanotechnology also allows using lipid nanoparticles which have potential application in drug delivery. α-tocopherol, resveratrol (50mg/kg orally) and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) co-loaded in self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system was used as a preventive treatment to evaluate the effects in a DMBA-induced breast cancer in rats. The concentration of plasma resveratrol after single oral administration of the nanoemulsifying system was significantly higher respect a free antioxidants suspension. The results displayed higher tumor latency and a lower tumor volume and percentage of animals with tumors; in addition, angiogenic markers (TNF-α, IL-6, MMP-2, and MMP-9) in blood samples diminished with the prophylactic treatment [120]. In addition, silibinin-loaded lipid nanoparticles containing D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate and phosphatidylcholine was studied in breast cancer metastasis mice model by means of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Firstly, the results evidenced that these nanoparticles (20 ng/mL) were an effective drug delivery system since their correct internalization and with a better uptake than the free flavonoid (20 μg/mL). In fact, it is noticeably that the used nanoparticles could accumulate within tumor tissues with high efficiency and amounts. Secondly, nanoparticles lowered the invasiveness and migration of the tumor cells in a dose dependent manner (5, 10 and 20 μg/mL) after 24 h in a high degree than free silibinin. The possible molecular mechanism was related to the reduction of the Snail and MMP-9 levels, as mediators of cancer invasion and metastasis, after silibinin-loaded lipid nanoparticles administration. This research group also reported a reduction of the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules after silibinin and especially after the nanoparticle treatment in 4T1 orthotopic implanted homograft mouse model. In addition, the MDA-MB-231 cells were implanted in nude mice observing that treatment with nanoparticle-encapsulated silibinin also reduced the lung nodules and increased the body weight [121].\nIn addition to anticancerigen properties, encapsulated flavonoids have been used to assess the radiotherapy effects. The radiotherapy induces tissue damage and tea polyphenols have been described to protect against the side effects of this therapy. BSA− green tea polyphenols− chitosan nanoparticles orally administered 3 days before radiation in mice diminished oxidative damage by directly trapping free radicals before they cause damage to macromolecules and increasing SOD, catalase and GPX activities through Nrf2/ERK pathway and apoptosis (Bax expression). The treatment with encapsulated green tea polyphenols also reversed the reduction in splenocyte proliferation induced by exposure to whole-body irradiation (4 Gy) [122].\nTo sum up, several studies have been conducted last years in order to prevent or ameliorate the carcinogenesis process in in vivo models. These works have allowed to test the nanotechnology application together with chemotherapeutic drugs to target the tumor site. Promising and better results have been obtaining with several flavonoids encapsulated in carriers of different nature than in their free form; since most of the studies have described an inhibition of several kinds of tumor in animal models."

      "text" : "Cancer treatment and prevention approach are mostly target the cell apoptosis, and plant derived compounds, especially flavonoids have found very effective. The increased bioavailability and target drug delivery using nano-formulations have potentially synergistic the effect of\nflavonoids against cancer, as shown in various in vitro and in vivo studies, as stated above. These experiments have shown potential of nano-flavonoids against cancer. However, very few clinical trials have been performed on nano-flavonoids.\nConcerning the clinical significance of flavonoids against cancer prevention and treatment, various clinical trials have been conducted using flavonoids alone or in combination with others. The most common flavonoids that have been tested clinically against cancer are catechin (green tea extract/capsule), epigallocatechin-3-gallate and genistein. These were found effective in preventing and treating various forms of cancer, preferably prostate, breast, colorectal and lung. For, instance, many clinical trials have been conducted on testing green tea catechin extract against prostate cancer and found effective. Moreover, green tea extract was found effective against breast cancer (NCT00917735) [123], lung cancer (NCT00573885) [124], colon cancer (NCT01606124) [125], bladder Cancer (NCT00666562) [126], skin cancer (NCT01032031, NCT02029352) [127,128], cervical Cancer (NCT00303823) [129] and many more. Currently, the green tea catechin extract also tested against liver cancer (NCT03278925) [130]. Also, epigallocatechin-3-gallate is tested for lung (NCT02577393) [131], breast (NCT02580279) [132] and colorectal cancer (NCT02891538) [133]. Genistein which is a flavonoid compound has also been widely clinical tested against cancer. Quercetin and isoquercetin as such are widely tested against cancer in animal and cell culture model was also tested clinically, however in a very few trials.\nAlthough nano-flavonoids have been tested in in vitro and in vivo experiments against various cancer models, only one clinical trial has been initiated using luteolin natural extract and its nanoparticle and tested against tongue neoplasm (NCT03288298) [134] in 4 participants in non-randomized design, parallel assignment. The outcomes will be measured on gene expression of caspase 3 to detect apoptosis cell viability. As a number of animal and cell model showed effectiveness of nano-flavonoids in term of increased bioavailability and efficacy, more clinical trials need to be performed."

      "text" : "Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The conventional therapies are associated with number of adverse drug reactions. Generally natural agents including flavonoids are considered to be safe while treating or preventing diseases. Although flavonoids have shown great potential in combating various types of cancers, but the main concern is their bioavailability issues, site non-specific nature and their potential to interact with other therapeutic agents. These issues can be overcome thy designing nanoparticles of flavonoids. Similarly, in vitro and in vivo studies have reported the uses and benefits of nanoparticle-based formulations of flavonoids alone or in combination in treatment of cancers, however, very few clinical trials have yet to be performed. In the light of significant results, clinical trials to extensively evaluate nanoparticle-based formulations of flavonoids in treatment of cancers may be encouraged.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors of this article have no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nA.

    "abstractText" : "The conventional therapies for cancer have a major concern of poor accessibility to tumor tissues. Furthermore, the requirement of higher doses and non-selective nature of therapeutic are associated with a range of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). However, flavonoids are documented to be effective against various types of cancer, but they are not evaluated for their safety profile and tumor site-specific action. Low solubility, rapid metabolism and poor absorption of dietary flavonoids in gastrointestinal tract hinder their pharmacological potential. Some studies have also suggested that flavonoids may act as pro-oxidant in some cases and may interact with other therapeutic agents, especially through biotransformation. Nanocarriers can alter pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profile of incorporating drug. Moreover, nanocarriers are designed for targeted drug delivery, improving the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs, delivery of macromolecules to site of action within the cell, combining therapeutic agents with imaging techniques which may visualize the site of drug delivery and co-delivery of two or more drugs. Combining two or more anti-cancer agents can reduce ADRs and nanotechnology played a pivotal role in this regard. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown the potential of flavonoids nano-formulations, especially quercetin, naringenin, apigenin, catechins and fisetin in the prevention and treatment of several types of cancer. Similarly, clinical trials have been conducted using flavonoids alone or in combination, however, the nano-formulations effect still needs to be elucidated. This review focuses on the impact of flavonoids nano-formulations on the improvement of their bioavailability, therapeutic and safety profile and will open new insights in the field of drug discovery for cancer therapeutics.",
