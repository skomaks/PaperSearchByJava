Introduction\nNanotechnology extends its arms in the biomedical applications with\nthe advanced techniques from traditional approaches. Nanotechnology in medicine influences ‘Nanomedicine’which is being elaborated from the early 1990s [1]. This is determined as ‘Technology Transfer’ which plays a major role in medicine and health science to empower the recent trends [2]. The nanotechnology which describes the particles in the nanometre range, hence it is called as Nanoscale or otherwise called as Nanoparticles (NPs). The research in the biological science focused onNanoparticles through protein and nucleic acids in the field of nanomedicine to demonstrate the in-depth analysis of drug delivery [1]."

In recent years, the nanomedicine has complemented huge potential for the cancer therapeutics by overcoming from traditional approaches [4,5]. The target of achieving an improvement in therapeutic efficacy by designing nanomaterials which reduces the toxicity and to secure a safe and potential cancer treatment. In the modern approach, the massive work is under progress to carry out to develop the multi-functional system to converge the two advanced sciences nanotechnology and biological sciences which will revolutionize to investigate the cancer diagnosis and therapy. In which, this approach will be useful to deliver the drugs specifically to the tumour sites and the major challenge for the scientist is to notify the therapeutic response and it should be visualized in various form to know how the drug delivery to the specific targets of the tumour site [6,7].\n2. Role of phytochemicals to the synthesis of nano-biomaterials\nSeveral authors reported the various medicinal plants and their\nextract to combat cancer. They extended their investigation on polyphenols, flavonoids, triterpenoid, several alkaloids and their derivatives which demonstrated the possible mechanism against cancer which may targets on site individually or combination with other active compounds [8]. In this interest, Liu et al. reported the role of phytochemicals and their significances against cancer [9]. The phytochemicals present in medicinal plants can induce cytotoxicity against various types of cancerous cells shown in Table 1. Towards the progress of developing new applications in the field of medicine, the Nanotechnology plays a crucial role in order to develop nano-based products [19,20]. In recent days, the researchers are mainly focusing on metallic nanoparticles, where it has unique chemical and physical properties, this guides to the rapid actions as well as further research [21,22]. This review focusses on some metallic nanoparticles and their application towards the drug delivery. The formation of NPs and their biological efficacies, including anti-cancer activities, are shown in Fig. 1.\n293Emerging plant-based anti-cancer green nanomaterials\n4 Docetaxol\nHO\nO\nO\nO O\nO H N\nOOH\nOH\nOH O\nO\nO\nO\nTaxus species Breast cancer; ovarian cancer.

These properties shows more significance towards anti-bacterial [23], anti-cancer [24], anti-diabetic [25], anti-malarial [26], anti-fungal [23], anti-inflammatory [23] research. The substantial amount of research conducted against cancer research reveals that the AgNP has less adverse effects. Prabhu and co-workers [27] have synthesized AgNP from the methanolic extract ofVitex negundo L and they administered the dosage of about 20μg/mL to the HCT15 cell line. It shows that it has 50% inhibition of the cell viability. Further, another study reported that AgNPs from Acalypha indica reported cytotoxic properties against human breast tumour cells MDA-MB-231 cell line [28]. This indicates that an increase in concentration may also reflect on increased in cytotoxic efficacy of AgNPs [28].\nAnother study conducted by inducing CCl4 in liver cancer Swiss albino mice which shows the significance of the synthesis of Premna serratifolia leaves [29]. Further, the AgNP from Erythrina indica has shown a better cytotoxic effect against MCF-7 andHepG2 cell lines [30].

This potential is due to the AuNP is attracted towards the polar amino acids which contain thiol and amine groups. Hence, it leads to being the extensive usage in biomedical applications. The AuNP-treated HeLa carcinoma cell line has shown the dramatic increase in the reactive oxygen species which escorts the mitochondrial activity, macromolecules and from the cancerous cells. In addition to the above, the detection of 20nm AuNPs may be originated for the cause of oxidative stress in RC-5 fetal human lung fibroblasts. Whereas, another study reports that the synthesis of AuNPs from A. leptopus administered about the dosage of 257μg/mL which reveals the good anti-cancer activity against MCF-7 breast cancer cell line [33]. The three different doses (25, 50 and 75) μg/mL from the Cassia tora against colon cancer cell line has shown the highest activity at 75μg/mL [34]. Interestingly, anti-cancer activity investigated for the AuNPs obtained through green synthesis from the leaf extracts ofGymnema sylvestre against the HepG2 cell line. This investigation shows the significant toxic effects at a maximal concentration of 250μg/mL [35].

Further, the radiant energy will be transformed into the reactive oxygen species which reduces the damage of the healthy regions. The iron oxide has a special characteristic by having spherical in nature and which is used as an agent to treat prostate cancer in the combination of chemotherapy or radiotherapy by inducing magnetic tumour\n300 Muthupandian Saravanan et al.\nhyperthermia. This hyperthermic treatment which is about 150–400 °C tends to kill tumour cells. The mechanism of iron oxide is differed from other nanoparticles by having contact with the near-infrared radiation and transforms to heat and kills tumour cells [37,38]. Though the iron oxide NPs are instability and defenceless in aqueous media, this could be overcome by treating the surfaces with the hydrophilic coating [39]. Further, this nanoparticle considered as a carrier-based drug delivery showing substantial effects like in uniform size during synthesis [40], interaction in hosts or biocompatible and enhanced imaging visualization [41,42]. Hence, these characteristics play a crucial role to consider the iron oxide nanoparticle frequently to use in biomedical applications."

From the outcome of the cerium oxide NPs, this is a great size and shape dependent and inducing this NP may lead to DNA damage in tumour cell lines [45].

      "text" : "The benefit of combining the polymers and Nanoparticles provides the gateway for future research in terms of exhibiting the various properties like electrical, optical, mechanical and magnetic. Further, these engineering approaches open the various channels by emerging the nanoparticle and polymers to form the PINCs, otherwise called as Polymeric iron oxide nanocomposites. This protocol will form polymers as an aggregate but fails to make a proper dimension [49]. Therefore, it leads to macroscopic processing instead of nanoscale approaches. This key factor remains as a challenge for future research to develop the nanocomposites in the nanoscale.\n3. Parameters influencing the activity of nanomaterials\nTo control and estimate the activity of nanomaterials, it is of high\nimportance to explore the parameters that have an influence on the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials. These properties are responsible for the efficacy and toxicity of nanomaterials. The nanoparticle size and size distribution, composition, shape, surface charge, surface chemistry and surface functionalization, hydrophobicity, crystalline phase, crystallite size, and porosity of the NPs are the key parameters that influence the physicochemical properties and consequently the activity of nanomaterials [50,51]. The smaller the size of NPs, the better penetration of NPs through the malignant tissues. Although, smaller particles have less specificity compared to larger particles due to their tendency to extravasate into the normal tissues [52].\n302 Muthupandian Saravanan et al.\nNPs with a particle size of <5nm have a short circulation time and tend to penetrate into tissues, while NPs with a particle size of larger than 5nm are able to remain in circulation for a long time and accumulate in solid tumours by penetrating through the enlarged pores of vessels [53]. A study reported that the optimal particle size of AuNPs for penetration into CL1-0 andHeLa cell lines was 45nm in comparison to the particle size of 70 and 110nm [54]. Besides, the shape of NPs has an influence on their cellular uptake [55]. In a study, antibody conjugated rod-shaped NPs showed higher specific uptake and decreased nonspecific uptake in a series of breast cancer cell lines compared to spherical NPs [56]. Besides, a study reported that needle-like shaped NPs caused high gene-expression efficiency indicating the role of the shape of NPs as a key factor for successful siRNA therapy [57]. Moreover, in a study spherical-shaped AuNPs depicted higher cellular uptake in the HeLa cell line compared to rod-shaped AuNPs [58]. Additionally, the surface charge of NPs has a role in their circulation time. In particular, charged NPs can be rapidly opsonized and cleared by the immune system [59]. Significantly, the surface charge of NPs has a role in NPs internalization. The NPs containing positively charged surface can bind efficiently to cell membrane surfaces due to the cell surfaces negative charge, while electrostatic repulsion between NPs with negative surface charge and negatively charged surface membrane avoid the NPs internalization process [60]. The renal clearance of NPs is significantly affected by the size and surface charge of NPs [51]. It was reported that due to the negative charge of the glomerular membrane, cationic NPs with a particle size of 6–8nm showed better renal clearance in comparison to neutral or negatively charged NPs with the same size [61]. In addition, spherical NPs with a particle size of <6nm showed better renal clearance in comparison to spherical NPs with a particle size of larger than 8nm [62]. Remarkably, size and surface charge of NPs influence in their CNS penetration. It was shown that the particle size of 20–70nm was optimum for CNS transport [51]. It was reported that cationic NPs have neurotoxic potential owing to increased permeability [63]. Furthermore, surface charges of NPs can have an influence on NPs tendency to bind a range of plasma proteins in the blood vessels [64].\n4. Emerging potential plant-based anti-cancer nanomaterials\nNanomaterials and in particular metallic NPs exhibit unique proper-\nties due to their high surface area and nanoscale size. Numerous research\n303Emerging plant-based anti-cancer green nanomaterials\nattentions have been given to developing novel strategies for the preparation of NPs. Among these, the biological approach has been attractive to researchers who wish to use safe and eco-friendly methods to synthesize various size and shape of metallic NPs. Among biological methods, phytosynthesis of NPs has drawn attention as an alternative approach for conventional physical and/or chemical approaches and has given rise to a novel field which can be named as ‘Phytonanotechnology’ dealing with preparation of metal NPs by using herbal resources [65]. Plant-mediated synthesis of metallic NPs has been gaining importance in the field of nanoscience due to its advantages such as simplicity, eco-friendliness, non-pathogenicity, rapidness, cost-effectiveness, etc. The plant extracts contain rich amount of biomolecules such as enzymes, alkaloids, tannins, phenolics, saponins, terpenoids, proteins, amino acids, polysaccharides, and vitamins that act as reducing and capping agents as well as providing stability of NPs [66–68]. It seems that more than one of the mentioned agents may be in charge of bioreduction of metallic NPs. Furthermore, the composition of these agents varies in different plants. Hence, the exact mechanism of phytosynthesis of NPs has not been completely understood as yet [67]. Reports have emerged that a large number of plants have been exploited for the biosynthetic process of NPs preparation. The anti-cancer potential of these biogenic NPs has been discussed briefly in the present review (Table 2).\n5. Anti-cancer mechanisms of action of nanomaterials\nThe anti-cancer mechanisms of biogenic metallic NPs are not fully\nunderstood yet. Although, reports have emerged that upregulation of p53 protein and caspase-3 expression, inhibition of VEGF-induced activities, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and Sub-G1 arrest in the cell are the significant suggested anti-cancer mechanisms associated to biogenic metallic NPs [65,87]. Metallic NPs cause DNA damage via oxidative DNA damage, mutation, DNA strand break, and chromosomal aberration [88,89] as well as oxidation of DNA bases owing to overproduction of ROS [90]. Besides, metallic NPs may induce the release of cytokines like IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α as inflammatory factors that lead to DNA damage and may prevent DNA repair [91]. Fig. 2 illustrates an overview of probable anti-cancer mechanisms of biogenic metallic NPs against cancerous cells. Overproduction of ROS within a cell prevails over cellular antioxidant defence system [91–94].

Notably, the glutathione is a tripeptide which is made from cysteine, glycine, and glutamic acid and have several critical roles through the cells such as regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis, direct chemical neutralization of singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide radicals, as well as detoxification of both xenobiotic and endogenous compounds. Besides, glutathione is found in cells in two reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) forms. The ratio of GSH to GSSG (i.e., GSH/GSSG) in healthy cells are above 100, while this ratio in the cells that were exposed to oxidant stress drops from 1 to 10 [95]. GSH is oxidized by overproduction of ROS and changes to GSSG and further, the loss of GSH leads to a significant increase of cytotoxicity [60]. Besides, the activation of caspase-3 by ROS is responsible for cell apoptosis by arresting the cell cycle at the G2/M phase [96]. Considerably, not only ROS generation [97] but also an interruption of ATP synthesis [98] by metallic NPs disturb the respiratory chain function of mitochondria as well as cytochrome c release into the cytosol. Besides, translocation of Bax to the mitochondria induces mitochondrial pathway apoptosis with ROS generation and C-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, and also cause cell cycle arrest in the G1 and S phases [91,99]. Additionally, metallic NPs may block the VEGF-induced signalling pathway. VEGF promotes VEGF receptor-2 (KDR/Flk-1) activation that leads to activate the enzymes cascade regulating cell survival, migration, proliferation, and vasodilation [91].\n308 Muthupandian Saravanan et al.\nMoreover, it was shown that upregulation of some genes by metallic NPs including caspase-1, apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase (CASP1), apoptosis inhibitor (FKSG2), growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein (GADD45A) alpha, and DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3) leads to DNA damage, chromosome instability, and mitosis inhibition [100]. In a study, spherical-shaped AgNPs were synthesized with an average size of 14nm by using leaf extract of Podophyllum hexandrum. Biosynthesized AgNPs induced the apoptosis in treated HeLa cells. Molecular investigations in this study revealed that AgNPs exhibited the downregulation of Bcl-2 gene and conversely, upregulation of the Bax gene. This regulation of Bcl-2 and Bax initiates a cascade that leads to the activation of the caspases 3, 8 and 9 which are responsible for apoptotic cell death. Thereby, this modulation of Bax and Bcl-2 expressions in the mitochondria suggested an intrinsic apoptotic pathway that was induced by biogenic AgNPs [101]. A study reported phytosynthesis of AgNPs by using flower aqueous extract of Lonicera hypoglauca in the range of 4.99–25.83nm. The prepared NPs induced upregulation of the p53 tumour suppressor gene and the subsequent increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9, as well as downregulation of the mRNA levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 resulting in promoting apoptosis in MCF-7 cancer cells. Considerably, biosynthesized NPs inhibited the expressions of mRNA of JAK, STAT-1, and STAT-3 genes in MCF-7 cancer cells [102]. It is well known that JAK/STAT signalling upregulates anti-apoptotic genes [103]. Similarly, plant-mediated synthesized AgNPs in the range of 10–50nm induced upregulation of p53 and caspase-3 along with downregulation of Bcl-2 genes and nuclear DNA damage in MCF-7 cancer cells [104]. Furthermore, phytosynthesized AuNPs with an average particle size of 15nm induced upregulation of the Bax gene and downregulation of Bcl-2 gene in HeLa cells at the concentration of 20μg/mL [105].\n6. Future prospects of nanomaterials for cancer nanomedicine\nNanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology involv-\ning the use of various types of nanomaterials as potential tools for cancer diagnosis and therapy [51,57]. It is safe to conclude that the future of phytosynthesized NPs is extremely bright because of their eco-friendliness, cheaper cost, and high biocompatibility [106]. A 2018 meta-analysis depicted that the odds of cytotoxicity of biogenic metallic NPs in cancerous\n309Emerging plant-based anti-cancer green nanomaterials\ncell lines were found to be nine times more than normal cell lines indicating higher cytotoxicity of metal NPs in cancerous cell lines (OR¼9.004, P < 0.001) [60]. This finding is important because it is required that biogenic metallic NPs as anti-cancer agents have less cytotoxicity in normal cells compared to malignant cells. Thereby, according to the recent advantages in cancer nanomedicine, it is expected that biogenic metallic NPs may emerge as potential cancer therapeutic agents alone or in combination with FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs in the near future. However, further studies are required to find out the exact role of phytochemicals for the synthesis, stabilization, or pharmaceutical potentials of metallic NPs. Furthermore, the surface of these metallic NPs can be modified with biologic materials such as peptides, antibodies, aptamers, and small molecules to target a specific receptor in cancer cells [53]. Besides, these NPs can be conjugated with anti-cancer agents for their delivery after reaching their target sites. Moreover, the thermal therapy of these biogenic metallic NPs can open a new avenue in cancer nanomedicine. In details, when the NPs reach their target sites, they can be destroyed by external energy sources such as optics or magnetics enabling NPs to heat in vivo in a localized site to kill cancer cells in parts of the body [107]. Future investigations should be conducted to control the behaviour of NPs through in vivomodels. Because the behaviour of NPs is associated with their design along with their interactions in the body. Hence, engineering the behaviour of NPs empower them to move, emit light or heat, or to release a cargo and bring their success as treatment and diagnostic agents. [53]. Besides, mathematical optimization may help to study binding kinetics and diffusion of NPs enabling targeted NPs to penetrate deep into tumour tissues [108]. Overall, designing functionalized NPs along with deep biological understanding, and computational tools are emerging as the next frontier.\n7. Barriers for green nanomaterials as future cancer nanomedicine\nAlthough nanotechnology has paved the way for a revolution in can-\ncer nanomedicine, there are considerable challenges that should be addressed in the future. Comprehensive studies are required to demonstrate biocompatibility and biodegradability of biogenic metallic NPs along with their uptake, retention, clearance, dosage, and route of administration before these NPs enter clinical trials for cancer theranostics. Besides, in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies should be carried out. NPs may\n310 Muthupandian Saravanan et al.\nalso trigger immunogenic reactions [107]. Thereby, the counter proceeding should be considered to suppress such sensitization reactions. Biophysical barriers like increased osmotic pressures within cancerous cells lead to inappropriate diffusion of NPs through the cancerous tissues [109]. Consequently, new strategies such as surface modifiers are suggested to overcome biophysical barriers. Moreover, the interactions between biogenic metallic NPs with protein coronas like tubulin, ubiquitin, and human serum albumin should be studied attentively [110], because the formation of protein coronas around the NPs may result in unexpected in vivo outcomes, and consequent interfering with the biological activities of NPs [65]. Last but not the least, sufficient data about the acute and chronic toxicity of biogenic metallic NPs in clinical studies are lacking and future works should identify the hazards concerning the use of biogenic metallic NPs before applying the procedure to clinical trials.\n8. Conclusion\nBiogenic metallic NPs are currently in the laboratory-type setting for\nthe treatment and diagnosis of cancer. Taken together, the biocompatibility and effectiveness of these green NPs as theranostic agents for cancer caused that many studies have been performed in recent years. Although our knowledge base in relation to the anti-cancer potential of phytosynthesized metallic NPs has expanded over the last decade, comparatively little research has been conducted on their genotoxicity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety profile alone or in conjugation with other drugs. Most of the studies conducted so far have been mainly concerned with cytotoxicity of metallic NPs through in vitro models. These findings have provided initial evidence of the potential value of greenNPs through in vivomodels, and future additional in vivo studies will allow us to draw stronger conclusions for the anti-cancer efficacy of these NPs. Furthermore, clear empirical evidence on the differential cytotoxicity effects of types of plant sources and their phytochemicals that are responsible for the NPs formation, stabilization, and also their biogenic activities is lacking, as research on this issue has produced conflicting results. Hence, additional researches in this area provide stronger evidence of the possible positive or negative effects of secondary metabolites, which exist in the plant extract, on the anti-cancer efficacy of these NPs. In spite of all the challenges, we hope that biogenic metallic NPs would be a cancer nanomedicine candidate in the near future.\n311Emerging plant-based anti-cancer green nanomaterials"
