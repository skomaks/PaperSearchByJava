The stability, drug loading, anti-ultraviolet, adhesion, sustained-release and toxicity of nano-pesticides presented considerable behavior confirmed via various characteristics. The results indicated that AVM@P-Zein/CMC-g-PDMDAAC had an average particle size of 360 nm, and possessed favorable dispersion performance and excellent anti-ultraviolet property compared to P-Zein. And comparatively, encapsulation efficiency increased up to 82.11%. In addition, adhesion performance of AVM@P-Zein/CMC-g-PDMDAAC on foliage also improved by about 20% compared to P-Zein. Also, AVM@P-Zein/CMC-g-PDMDAAC can intelligently control pesticide release by adjusting monomer ratio and pH values. More importantly, such nano-pesticide system presented no significant difference on toxicity in comparison with bare AVM.\nKEYWORDS: Zein; Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose; Nano-carrier; Foliage adhesion; Sustained release; Anti-UV property\n1. Introduction\nJo ur\nna l P\nr -p\nro of\nNano-pesticide formulation has many advantages such as remarkable targeted\ndelivery, intelligent controlled release property, great efficiency, and environmental friendliness, compared with traditional pesticide formulations, which is of great research interest of pesticide formulation at present (Kumar et al., 2018). The potential use of nanotechnology lies on protection and delivery of drugs, which provides new ideas for green and sustainable agricultural development. Therefore, the relevant characteristics of nanomaterials can be used to design intelligent formulations for pesticides, alleviating the related shortcomings of pesticides (Zhao et al., 2017). Nanocarriers can protect pesticides from adverse environmental conditions such as high temperature and radiation, and significantly improve their chemical stability (Bugatti et al., 2019; Li, Zhou, Pang, & Qiu, 2017), which can also enhance the dispersibility and wettability of pesticides and reduce the risk of organic solvents to environment. The characteristics of nano-pesticide formulation can be benefit from its large surface area, good stability, biodegradability and targeting to pests (Yegin et al., 2017; Ezhilarasi, Karthik, Chhanwal, & Anandharamakrishnan, 2013; George & Abraham, 2006). To date, more and more researchers focus on the development of novel advanced nano formula to maintain stability and activity under the sun, heat, rain and other spray conditions, and to penetrate into the target and release effective components, prolonging the effective time and improving the efficacy of pesticides (Kacsó et al., 2018; Wu, Wang, Wang, Li, & Liang, 2019; Agostini, Winter, & Engert, 2015; Sinisi et al., 2018; Babu, Sairam, Hosamani, & Aminabhavi, 2007; Smith & Gilbertson, 2018). Jo ur na l P re -p ro of\nProteins not only have unique spatial structure to realize drug loading, but also\nhave good biodegradability and biocompatibility, promoting them be applied in agriculture and medical field (Chen et al., 2019; Kapoor & Kundu, 2016; Fang, Chen, Leu, & Wang, 2006; Lin et al., 2019; Corradini et al., 2014), for instance, walnut protein, peanut protein, almond protein isolate, and other plant proteins can be carrier for drugs as well as nutrients for the human body (Elzoghby, Samy, & Elgindy, 2012; Verma, Gulati, Kaul, Mukherjee, & Nagaich, 2018).\nZein is classified as a safe protein by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),\nwhich has unique solubility, biocompatibility, biodegradability, anti-oxidation, non-toxicity and other advantages, and also can be used as a drug carrier in food, cosmetics and medical fields (Luo & Qin, 2014). In addition, in the wet process of industrial production of maize starch, a large amount of maize residues are usually produced, in which zein accounts for about 60%. Approximately 80,000 tons annual of zein are discharged with waste liquor, resulting in serious waste of resources and leading to environmental pollution (Lin et al., 2013). The research and application of zein in corn residue can help the rational utilization of resources and alleviate the environmental problems caused by accumulation.\nZein is insoluble in aqueous solution, but has good solubility in 60%-95% alcohol\nsolution, which can simply precipitate to form nanoparticles by anti-solvent method (Paliwal & Palakurthi, 2014; Hu & Mcclements, 2015). Zein composite nanoparticles have the potential to encapsulate and release bioactive molecules in food and drug\nJ ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro f\nformulations as natural delivery systems (Li et al., 2019). In addition, another advantage for zein as carries is that both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs can be encapsulated (Patel & Velikov, 2014; Kacsó et al., 2018; Oliveira et al., 2019) . In general, hydrophobic bioactive substances and zein are dissolved in ethanol solvent, and then mixed with water and other anti-solvents to precipitate the bioactive substances with zein. In this process, due to the strong hydrophobicity and hydrogen bond, the bioactive substances migrate rapidly into zein particles (Oliveira et al., 2018). A variety of hydrophobic bioactive substances are encapsulated in corn protein granules, including avermectin, ciprofloxacin, 5-fluorouracil and DNA, as well as essential oils, enzymes, polyphenols and other nutrients (Luo et al., 2013; Lai & Guo, 2011). For instance, Luo et al. (Luo et al., 2013) encapsulated two kinds of drugs 3-indolylcarbinol (I3C) and 3,3’-diindolylmethane (DIM) by liquid-liquid phase separation and ion gel method into zein/carboxymethyl chitosan, which could well control the release of drugs. Lai et al. (Lai & Guo, 2011) wrapped 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in zein particles by phase separation for liver targeting.\nIn order to improve the utilization of pesticides, primary task is to improve the\nhydrophilicity of zein, so that zein can be dispersed stably in water with nanometer size after loading pesticides. The second is to improve the properties of nano-pesticides, such as drug loading, stability, adhesion, sustained release and stimulus response. Feng et al. (Feng & Lee, 2016) used sodium caseinate (NaCas) to modify the surface of zein nanoparticles in order to improve the hydrophilicity. Chuacharoen et al. (Chuacharoen & Sabliov, 2017) modified zein nanoparticles by folic acid hydrophilic modification. The Jo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\nresults showed that the modified nanoparticles could be stably dispersed in phosphoric acid buffer solution and had good biocompatibility and targeting in cells. Phosphorylation of zein can also improve hydrophilicity, anti-ultraviolet, adhesion and sustained release properties of pesticides to some extend (Hao et al., 2019). Furthermore, the performance of phosphorylated-zein (P-Zein) based nano-pesticides need to be improved in further step by encapsulating a layer of functional polymer on the surface. Based on this point, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) has good hydrophilicity, film forming, adhesion, biocompatibility and biodegradability (Lin et al., 2013). Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2019) used CMC to improve the stability of denatured feather keratin and realized pesticide loading. The incorporation of proteins with CMC have been studied to improve surface properties (Gao et al., 2017). Bikova et al. (Bikova & Treimanis, 2004) showed that the chromogenic groups such as carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of CMC can absorb part of ultraviolet light and have certain anti-ultraviolet properties by irradiating ultraviolet light. Therefore, CMC can be used to improve the performance of phosphorylated-zein based nano-pesticides, such as stability, ultraviolet resistance, adhesion and so on. However, the existing problem is that CMC is difficult to spontaneously combine with phosphorylated-zein based nano-pesticides directly, so it is necessary to modify CMC and introduce functional groups. As known, diallyldimethylammonium chloride (DMDAAC) has high practical value because of its non-toxicity, bactericidal, easy to control molecular weight polymerization, low cost and high positive charge density (Peng et al., 2018). Therefore, DMDAAC can be used to Jo ur na l P re -p oo f\nmodify CMC, which can spontaneously combine with phosphorylated-zein based nano-pesticides by electrostatic interaction.\nIn present work, CMC-g-PDMDAAC was prepared by graft copolymerization of\nsodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with DMDAAC as functional monomers. Avermectin (AVM) was selected as model pesticide. And AVM@P-Zein/CMC-g-PDMDAAC nano-pesticide was prepared by electrostatic interaction encapsulation. The formation mechanism is schematically shown in Scheme 1a.\nScheme 1.

Then, the graft copolymerization was conducted at 80 °C for 6 h.

Encapsulation efficiency\nAVM encapsulation behavior inside P-Zein/CMC-g-PDMDAAC was investigated and\nthe amount of encapsulated AVM in P-Zein/CMC-g-PDMDAAC was quantified by UV-Vis analysis. To this end, the effect of parameters, i.e. phosphorylation degree of zein, mass ratio of CMC to DMDAAC, and pH, were analyzed as follows.\n3.3.1 Effect of phosphorylation degree of zein on encapsulation efficiency\nJo\nur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\nThe effect of phosphorylation degree of zein in AVM@P-Zein/CMC-g-PDMDAAC on\nencapsulation efficiency was investigated under the mass ratio of CMC and DMDAAC kept 1:0.12 and pH of 7.

This phenomenon was presumably because that it produced more phosphate groups inside P-Zein with higher phosphorylation degree, leading to the electrostatic repulsion becoming stronger as well as the inner three dimensional structure of protein expanding, hence it held more space inside the protein to carry on more pesticides increasing the particle size (from 233.10±10.13 to 369.25±15.71 nm). On the other hand, CMC-g-PDMDAAC was preferable to capture more AVM through electrostatic effect which wrapped on the surface of P-Zein with higher phosphorylation degree, then also resulting in the encapsulation efficiency growing and causing the increase of particle size. The increase of phosphorylation degree brought the negative charge growing evidenced from zeta potential (from -50.45±1.21 to -54.24±0.78 mV) in Table 1, and also confirming the colloidal stability of P-Zein system.\nTable 1.

As aforementioned, DMDAAC possessed positive charges and could capture more AVM through electrostatic effect, hence, the encapsulation efficiency of AVM@P-Zein/CMC-g-PDMDAAC grew a bit with the increase of DMDAAC portion. This reason can be explained in the aspect of change of zeta potential (from -50.78±1.55 to -34.85±1.21 mV) with higher mass ratio of CMC to DMDAAC, leading to the decrease of amount of CMC-g-PDMDAAC on the surface on P-Zein, thus resulting in the decrease of particle size (281.16±5.79 to 245.30±8.65 nm) accordingly.

Meantime, both particle size and negative charge raised with pH increasing from 3 to 9. These results can be presumably due to deprotonation of phosphate, strengthening the electrostatic repulsion inside zein protein and thus leading to expansion of inner three dimensional protein structure and reducing the internal tightness of protein to provide more space for carry more pesticides and increase the particle size. In addition, carboxylate groups were also prone to deprotonation with pH increasing, therefore increasing the negative charges on the surface as well. Another phenomenon was that when pH values grew from 5 to 9, the encapsulation efficiency present stable, which possible owing to reaching carrier capacity limit. Furthermore, the nano-carrier system of AVM@P-Zein-3/CMC-g-PDMDAAC was fairly stable against aggregation under any pH value, due to DMDAAC not hydrolysis and combining with unprotonated phosphate even in the acid condition, thus improving the stability under acidic condition.

This trend can be ascribed to the electrostatic effect between CMC-g-PDMDAAC and AVM@P-Zein becoming stronger when DMDAAC mass ratio was higher, therefore enhancing the tightness of outer layer of CMC-g-PDMDAAC and slowing down the release rate of AVM. Another reason was presumably that cationic properties improved the attractive interaction of AVM with the increase of DMDAAC proportion, which limited AVM come out by PDMDAAC.

Generally speaking, the residual rate of AVM varied in only small extend as phosphorylation degree decreased, which was ascribed to P-Zein located in the inner layer not touching cucumber leaves. And variation in the phosphorylation degree only changed the electrostatic effect between AVM@P-Zein and CMC-g-PDMDAAC, therefore P-Zein had little effect on the adhesion behavior. Compared with the residual rate of AVM@P-Zein with 39.10±1.12 % in our previous report (Hao et al., 2019), the adhesion ability improved almost 20 % once AVM@P-Zein encapsulated with CMC-g-PDMDAAC. The membrane formation of CMC contributed to the enhancement, which could interact with the surface of leaves. Besides, the hydrogen bond formed between hydroxyl from CMC and aliphatic acid originated from leaves could also strengthen the adhesion ability and reduce the loss of sample during water eroding, thereby improving the Jo ur na l P r pr\no f\nutilization of pesticides.\nFigure 4f elucidated the effect of mass ratio of CMC to DMDAAC on the adhesion\nability of AVM@P-Zein/CMC-g-PDMDAAC on leaves.

The higher mass ratio of DMDAAC resulted in the larger residual amount of AVM in the samples and indicated the better adhesion performance. This phenomenon was due to the mass ratio increase of DMDAAC increasing the positive charges in the CMC-g-PDMDAAC system, which reducing the amount of CMC-g-PDMDAAC wrapped on the outer surface of P-Zein as well as the particle size of AVM@P-Zein/CMC-g-PDMDAAC.

Specifically, AVM dispersing in ethanol solution without encapsulated using P-Zein/CMC-g-PDMDAAC degraded rapidly under UV light irradiation. After 1 h, the remaining rate of AVM was 86.15±0.30 %, and 11 h later, the remaining rate became 45.36±0.25 %, continuously, the remaining rate was only 38.28±0.35 % after 47 h irradiation, from which obtained the half-life for bare AVM was nearly 10 h.

This demonstrated the anti-UV property and light-stability of AVM encapsulated in P-Zein/CMC-g-PDMDAAC was much better than AVM unencapsulated. It was also discovered that the higher amount of DMDAAC was preferably to keep the higher remaining rate of AVM under 47 h of irradiation. This was presumably considered that DMDAAC had stronger electrostatic effect with AVM@P-Zein and the combination between them decreased the void space among CMC-g-PDMDAAC, therefore improving the light irradiation-stability. Compared with anti-UV performance for AVM@P-Zein in our previous work (Hao et al., 2019), ultraviolet resistance performance improved approximately 10% when AVM@P-Zein encapsulated with CMC-g-PDMDAAC. One reason was that CMC-g-PDMDAAC encapsulation increased the thickness of AVM@P-Zein to protect AVM better.
