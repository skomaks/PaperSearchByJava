      "text" : "In recent years, with the rapid development of the microelectronics towards miniaturization, high-degree integration and multifunctionalization, there are a lot of accumulated heat being generated when electronic devices are working. Therefore, the heat removal has become a critical issue that needs to be solved immediately to guarantee the performance, lifespan and reliability of electronics device [1–3]. Polymer-based composites with high thermal conductivity have been widely used as the thermal management package materials owing to their excellent characteristics, such as light mass, low cost, easy processing, small coefficient of thermal expansion, etc. [4] Most of pure polymers have poor thermal conductivity generally below 0.5 W m 1 K 1 [5], which cannot satisfy the thermal diffusion requirement of modern electronics [6,7]. In order to improve the thermal conductivity of polymers, a common strategy was to add high thermal conductivity fillers. Various ceramic fillers such as alumina [8],\naluminum nitride [9], boron nitride [10], and silicon carbide [11] have been widely used because they have the advantages of low cost, high thermal conductivity and electrical insulation property, etc. However, those composites required high loading of ceramic fillers, which not only increased the difficulty of processing but also destroyed the mechanical properties of the composites [12].\nGraphene is a two-dimensional single-layer graphite, which has received extensive attention in thermal management due to its ultrahigh thermal conductivity (~5300 W m 1 K 1) [13].However, the thermal conductivity of graphene-based composites is much lower than the inherent thermal conductivity of graphene. The main reason is that graphene nanosheets tend to aggregate and are poorly dispersed in the matrix [14,15]. This could result in high interfacial thermal resistance and insufficient heat transfer path, which in turn results in a decrease in thermal conductivity [16]. Much effort on graphene as filler to improve thermal conductivity of composites has been proposed.

Song et al. prepared reduced graphene oxide/nanofibrillated cellulose composite films via vacuum filtration [18] and graphene nanosheets/nanofibrillated cellulose composite via layer-by-layer assembly process [19]. The in-plane thermal conductivity of composite film reached 6.17 W m 1 K 1 and 12.6 W m 1 K 1, respectively. Yang et al. fabricated polystyrene composites with silver nanoparticles-decorated reduced graphene oxide by electrostatic self-assembly and a hot press process. The composites achieved a thermal conductivity of 0.54 W m 1 K 1 for rGO and AgNPs loading of 2.39 vol% [20]. Zhou et al. prepared graphene-carbon nanotube composite films that exhibited a high thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity [21]. However, the high electrical conductivity of graphene inevitably hinders the practical application in the electronics packing field where electrical insulation is required. To the best of our knowledge, there are rare reports focusing on using graphene-based filler to regulate both the high thermal conductivity and electrical insulation property of composites.\nOne-dimensional nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) with biodegradability, light-weight, transparency, and high mechanical properties is a material that can spontaneously form a layered continuous network [22, 23]. Therefore, NFC-based composites have attracted more and more attention [24,25]. In this work, we report a strategy through alumina nanoparticles-deposited graphene (f-Al2O3@RGO) as the hybrid filler for the NFC matrix to achieve the high thermal conductivity by facile vacuum-assisted filtration technique. f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film has a typical layered structure and excellent flexibility. This composites film can combine the advantage of both Al2O3 and RGO, which exhibited high thermal conductivity and favorable electrical insulation. As a result, a flexible, light-weight and electrical insulating composite film was achieved. The in-plane thermal conductivity of the composite film with 30 wt% RGO and 5.6 wt% f-Al2O3 is 8.3 W m 1 K 1, which is 1975% higher than that of pure NFC. This feasible and scalable experimental method for constructing highly thermally conductive and insulating composites opens up a new avenue for the fabrication of high performance thermal-management materials in the near future."

      "text" : "The fabrication process of f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film is illustrated in Fig. 1. Through the electrostatic self-assembly process, the f-Al2O3 is deposited on GO. After adding NFC, the composite film is obtained by vacuum assisted filtration process.\nFig. 2a presents the photographs of the NFC, GO, RGO and hybrid solution, respectively. NFC solution is homogenous and transparent. Owing to the existence of a large amount of oxide-containing functional groups, GO dispersion is stable. However, the stability of RGO dispersion is poor. Compared with RGO, f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC hybrid solution exhibits great stability even after six months, which could be attributed to the interaction of hydroxyl groups on the NFC with the remaining oxide-\ncontaining groups of the RGO [27]. Fig. 2b displays the TEM image of f-Al2O3@RGO, which shows f-Al2O3 nanoparticle was deposited on RGO.\nFig. 3a exhibits the FTIR spectra of Al2O3 and f-Al2O3. For Al2O3, the bands of 3443 and 1632 cm 1 are recognized to the stretching and bending vibrations of –OH. In contrast with Al2O3, the spectrum of fAl2O3 shows some new bands at 2930, 1560, 1495 and 1120 cm 1, which is attributed to –CH2 asymmetric stretching vibrations, N–H bending vibrations, –CH2 bending vibrations, C–N stretching vibrations, respectively. These characteristic peaks indicate that APTS successfully modified Al2O3 [13]. TGA tests also provided the evidence of successful modification of Al2O3 (Fig. 3b). F–Al2O3 exhibits 2.5 wt% mass loss compared with Al2O3 when the temperature reaches to 700 �C, which suggests that the APTS content on Al2O3 is approximately about 2.5 wt %. Fig. 3c presents the FTIR spectra of GO and f-Al2O3@GO. For GO, the peak at 3412, 1734, 1624, 1226 and 1055 cm 1 are attributed to –OH stretching vibrations, C–O stretching vibration at the carboxyl group, –OH bending vibrations, C–O–C stretching vibrations, C–OH stretching vibrations, respectively [28,29]. However, the spectrum of f-Al2O3@GO exhibits new bands at 826 and 1530 cm 1, which is attributed to N–H rocking vibrations, C–N stretching vibrations, respectively. At the same time, the band at 1226 cm 1 (C–O–C) disappeared, implying the reaction between the epoxide of GO and amino group of f-Al2O3 [28,30]. And the wide absorption band from 500 to 1000 cm 1 is attributed to Al–O band of f-Al2O3. The results indicated that the f-Al2O3 is successfully deposited on GO.\nIn addition to FTIR, XPS provides an effective way to study the chemical components of composite films. Fig. 3d presents the highresolution of the C1s spectra of the f-Al2O3@RGO, the peaks at 284.6 eV, 285.8 eV, 286.8 eV and 288.6 eV are ascribed to the C–C/ C–C, C–O, C–N, O–C–O of RGO, respectively [31]. The two main peaks at 399.7 eV and 401.4 eV are attributed to C–N and N–H bonds in the N1s spectrum of the f-Al2O3@RGO (Fig. 3e). In the high-resolution of the Al2p of the f-Al2O3@RGO (Fig. 3f), the peak at 75.67 eV is attributed to Al–O, indicating the presence of f-Al2O3 on RGO. The results further demonstrated that f-Al2O3 was successfully deposited on RGO [30].\nAfter reduction, the intensities of oxide-containing groups dramatically decreased (Fig. 3g), which indicated that of GO is successfully reduced to RGO. The –OH peak of RGO/NFC and f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC shows a shift relative to that of the NFC, which may be caused by the hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 3g) [27,32]. The XRD patterns of GO, RGO, NFC, RGO/NFC, Al2O3, RGO/NFC and f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC are displayed in Fig. 3h and i. A characteristic diffraction peak at 10.2� is observed in the XRD pattern of GO [33]. However, RGO exhibits a flat broad peak centered at 23.5� after reduction, which implies that GO is\nS. Guo et al.\nComposites Part B 178 (2019) 107489\nsuccessfully reduced [33–35]. For NFC, the pattern exhibits two diffraction peaks at 15.3� and 22.4�, which reveals a typical structure of cellulose I structure [19]. While the RGO/NFC, the typical peak of GO is disappeared and exhibits the characteristic peaks of RGO and NFC, implying the successful combination of graphene and cellulose. The three typical diffraction peaks approximately at 37.1�, 45.7� and 66.9�\nof Al2O3 indicate the Al2O3 is the γ-Al2O3 crystalline structure [30], as shown in Fig. 3i. However, the characteristic peaks of Al2O3 cannot be found in the f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC, which may be attributed to that the f-Al2O3 content is so small that its diffractions are hardly detected.\nThe photographs of pure NFC, RGO/NFC and f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film are displayed in Fig. 4a. The obtained f-Al2O3@RGO/ NFC composite film is very light. And it can maintain its original shape after bending several times (Fig. 4b), indicating its excellent mechanical flexibility. Fig. 4c–e presents the cross-sectional morphology of the\nfilms. The NFC shows a relatively ordered structure with filaments (Fig. 4c). The cross-sectional morphology of RGO/NFC has a typical layered structure in which graphene nanosheets are alternately stacked along the plane direction of composite film and formed a compact layered structure (Fig. 4d). Similar to the RGO/NFC layered structure, the f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film also has a regularly arranged layered structure (Fig. 4e). However, the surface morphology of the composite film is rough because the NFC filaments are presented on the surface of the graphene nanosheets. Since the particle size of the f-Al2O3 is too small to be observed in the cross-sectional image, SEM elemental mappings were performed on f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film to demonstrate the presence and distribution of the Al2O3 (Fig. 4f). It can be found that the C, O and Al elements are uniformly distributed on the fAl2O3@RGO/NFC surface.\nThe in-plane thermal conductivity as a function of RGO contents for\nS. Guo et al.\nComposites Part B 178 (2019) 107489\nthe NFC composites with or without f-Al2O3 was investigated in Fig. 5a. The pure NFC has a poor thermal conductivity of about 0.4 W m 1 K 1 at room temperature, which was consistent with previously reported values [36]. When the RGO content is lower than 30 wt%, the thermal conductivity of RGO/NFC and f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film increases with the increase of RGO. The maximum in-plane thermal conductivity of RGO/NFC is 4.35 W m 1 K 1, whereas the f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film is founded to reach a maximum in-plane thermal conductivity of 8.3 W m 1K 1. Interestingly, the thermal conductivity of the f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film is not significantly increased relative to that of the RGO/NFC when the RGO content is less than 20 wt%. This could be caused by that the filler is encapsulated by the matrix when the filler content is low, so that the f-Al2O3 cannot form an effective connection between the RGO. But when the content of RGO reached to 30 wt %, the thermal conductivity of f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC rises sharply compared to RGO/NFC, indicating that RGO is effectively connected through f-Al2O3. Furthermore, the thermal conductivity decreased when RGO content exceeds 30 wt %. One possible explanation is the aggregation of RGO. To understand the role of f-Al2O3, the effect of f-Al2O3 contents on the thermal conductivity was investigated (Fig. 5b). The thermal conductivity of f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film increased firstly and then it subsequently decreased with the increase of f-Al2O3 content. The enhancement of thermal conductivity can be attributed to the bridging effect of f-Al2O3 among the RGO, which leads to an increase of thermal transfer path. However, the thermal conductivity of the composite film reduced when f-Al2O3 contents were over 5.6 wt%. This may be due to the aggregation of f-Al2O3, which lead to the increase of diameter of f-Al2O3. The distance between the RGO layers is enlarged by the large-sized f-Al2O3, which results in a decrease in the contact area of the RGO. The reduction in contact area of RGO and the increase in interfacial thermal resistance between the RGO result in lower thermal conductivity. The highest thermal conductivity (8.3 W m 1 K 1) of the f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film was achieved when the f-Al2O3 content is 5.6 wt%. The thermal conductivity enhancement (TCE) is a significant factor in determining the efficiency of fillers in NFC matrix. TCE is calculated by the following formula:\nTCE ¼ [K- Km]/Km (2)\nWhere K and Km is the thermal conductivity of composites and pure NFC, respectively. Fig. 5c displays the TCE as a function of RGO for the RGO/NFC and f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC. The TCE of f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC with 30 wt% RGO is 1975%, whereas the TCE of RGO/NFC is 987.5% at the same RGO content. The thermal conductivity as a function of the heating and cooling cycles for f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film is showed in Fig. 5d, which suggests the good thermal stability of the f-Al2O3@RGO/ NFC composite films in the temperature range from 25 to 100 �C. A model of composite film for thermal conduction paths was proposed in Fig. 5e. In this model, the heat flow is transferred from the hightemperature region to the low-temperature region along the graphene nanosheets, in which the heat flow is transported through f-Al2O3 to another adjacent graphene nanosheet (the arrows denote the directions of the heat flow). The increase in thermal conductivity of composite film is attributed to the following three points. First, the graphene nanosheets are aligned in the plane direction during the vacuum-assisted process, which further increases the contact area between the graphene nanosheets. So the heat flow is transferred along the heat conduction path formed by the graphene nanosheets. Second, since the hydroxyl group on the NFC has a hydrogen bonding interaction with the remained oxygen-containing functional groups of RGO, the NFC not only serves as the matrix in the system, but also acts as a crosslinking agent to efficiently connect and stably disperse graphene nanosheets. Third, f-Al2O3 on the surface of graphene is considered as “bridge” to effectively connect independent graphene nanosheet, which can increase the number of heat conduction paths.\nCompared with previous reports (Table 1), the f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC\ncomposite film has an excellent thermal conductivity. It is believed that the unique structure of this composite film plays a crucial role in improving the thermal conductivity of the polymers.\nIn order to demonstrate the thermal management application of the f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film, the temperature distribution of NFC, RGO/NFC and f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film with heating time was recorded by infrared thermal imager. To do this, a ceramic heating plate was used as a heat source and adhered to the surface of the film with thermal grease (Fig. 6a). The surface temperature distribution of these films with heating time is recorded. As showed in Fig. 6b, one can see that the center color of the NFC, RGO/NFC and f-Al2O3@RGO/ NFC composite film becomes brighter with heating time. Meanwhile, the color of lateral region of the.\nf-Al2O3@RGO/NFC is brighter than that of the NFC and RGO/NFC. After 300 s, the surface temperature of f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film is close to 60 �C, while the temperature of other films is much lower than 60 �C. This result illustrated that the f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film exhibited better heat-spreading performance compared to NFC and RGO/NFC.\nThermal stability is one of the important properties for thermal management materials in the field of electronic packaging applications. The TGA investigation was conducted to explore the thermal stability of the f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film (Fig. 7). Td 5% represents the temperature corresponding to the degradation of the sample at 5 wt%, indicating the information on the thermal stability of the sample [47]. In detail, the temperature of pure NFC and RGO/NFC at weight loss of 5 wt % is 109 �C and 129 �C, respectively. However, Td 5% is increased to 155 �C after the addition of the f-Al2O3@RGO. This is attributed to the stability of Al2O3, which hardly decomposes below 700 �C. The introduction of f-Al2O3 further increases the interaction with filler/matrix compared to that of the RGO/NFC, which could improve the thermal stability of composite film.\nElectrical insulation property is an important property for thermal management materials in the field of electronic packaging applications. Fig. 8 presents the volume resistivity of the f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film. The volume resistivity of pure NFC exceeds 1010 Ω cm, which is consistent with previously reported value [48]. However, when RGO (30%) is hereby added, the volume resistivity of RGO/NFC is significantly reduced compared with pure NFC, which is lower than the volume resistivity of the electrical insulator (109 Ω cm) [49]. This is resulted from the good conductivity of graphene. Compared with RGO/NFC, the volume resistivity of f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film increased slightly when the addition of f-Al2O3 is 2.9 wt%, but it still\nNote: TPS: Transient plane heat source method, PPMS: Physical property measurement system, TIMT: Thermal Interface Material Tester 1300.

When the addition of f-Al2O3 is further increased, the volume resistivity of f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite film increased gradually with the increase of f-Al2O3 content. The values are over 109 Ω cm, but still lower than that of NFC and maintained as insulators."

    "abstractText" : "Polymer composites with high thermal conductivity and good electrical insulation property exhibit great potential applications in electronic packing field. Herein, we report a composite film through functional Al2O3 (fAl2O3) deposited graphene as fillers to regulate both the thermal conductivity and the electrical insulation property of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC). The bridging effect of f-Al2O3 among graphene increased the number of heat conduction paths, thus improved the thermal conductivity of obtained f-Al2O3@RGO/NFC composite. The maximum in-plane thermal conductivity of obtained composite film is up to 8.3 W m 1 K 1, representing the enhancement of 1975% compared with the pure NFC. At the same time, owing to the inherent insulating property of Al2O3, the composite exhibited excellent electrical insulation property due to the inherent insulation property of Al2O3. This facile and scalable strategy could pave the way for the fabrication of thermal management materials in the next-generation electrical packing field.",
