Mn-based catalysts have attracted great attention for their excellent activity, but the poor SO2 resistance limits their application. Herein, we report a novel assembled composite featuring Mn3O4 nanoparticles embedded in defect-abundant graphitic carbon frame (Mn3O4@G-A) via a confinement–pyrolysis–oxidation strategy derived from MOF. The Mn3O4@G-A exhibits excellent activity (reaching over 90 % NO conversion in 100, 000 h−1 GHSV at 160 °C) and significantly improved SO2 resistance in comparison to pristine Mn3O4, and all the performance tests were conducted with 5.6 vol.% water vapor. By combining synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation, we further discovered the positive role and the origin of graphitic carbon for improving SO2 resistance. Over the Mn3O4@G-A sample, the electrons can be transferred from graphitic carbon to Mn3O4 nanoparticles, which can regulate the electronic properties and oxidizing ability of Mn3O4 nanoparticles. The proper oxidizing ability of Mn3O4@G-A can inhibit the oxidation of SO2 to SO3, thus further avoid the formation of NH4HSO4 and improve the SO2 resistance. Our work here not only solves the current problem of poor SO2 resistance of Mn-based catalysts, but also provides new insights into the design and synthesis of MOF-derived graphitic carbon-containing catalysts for SCR applications."

      "text" : "Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) NOx by NH3 is regarded as the most effective deNOx technology [1]. The commercial SCR catalyst is the supported V-W(Mo)/TiO2 which shows a high activity and stability in 300–400 °C [2,3]. However, the high working temperature of V-W (Mo)/TiO2 catalyst demands the SCR unit to locate upstream to the electrostatic precipitator and desulfurizer, which brings many problems such as the loss of active components by dust washing and the blockage of downstream pipeline by ammonium sulfates [4]. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop low-temperature SCR catalysts (working temperatures< 200 °C) to make denitrification used as the last unit of flue gas treatment. Mn-based catalysts are considered one class of the\nmost promising candidates for low-temperature SCR technology, but their poor SO2 resistance limits practical application [5–8]. Introducing a second metal or designing novel structures to tune the electronic structure of Mn oxides have been used to improve the SO2 resistance [9–11]. However, only a few catalysts can maintain stable activity in the presence of SO2, and it is still highly challenging but desirable to develop efficient Mn-based catalysts with remarkable SO2 resistance. According to the previous reports, the formation of NH4HSO4 and surface sulfate species caused by SO3 (the oxidation product of SO2) are the primary cause of catalyst deactivation, which can be attributed to the strong oxidizing ability of Mn-based catalysts [12–14]. Therefore, weakening the oxidizing ability of Mn-based catalysts could be an effective approach to enhancing the SO2 resistance. Yet on the other\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118731 Received 11 November 2019; Received in revised form 19 January 2020; Accepted 4 February 2020\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

All rights reserved.\nT\nhand, the oxidizing ability is the origin for the excellent SCR activity at low temperatures of Mn-based catalyst because oxidizing NO into NO2 is the key step to trigger the “fast SCR” reaction (NO+NO2 + 2NH3 → 2N2 + 3H2O) [15,16]. Therefore, finely regulating the oxidizing ability of Mn-based catalysts to selectively oxidize NO instead of SO2 is the key point to improve the SO2 resistance. Compared with MnO2 and Mn2O3, Mn3O4 has a weaker NO oxidizing ability due to the lower valence state of Mn element [17]. Therefore, after modification, Mn3O4 could be a promising candidate for low–temperature SCR deNOx catalyst with high SO2 resistance. Graphitic carbon could be an ideal component to further regulate the charge distribution of Mn3O4 because of its high conductivity, and has been widely studied in batteries for stability improvement [18]. However, according to our literature survey, there is no study focusing on the Mn3O4 surface modification by graphitic carbon for low–temperature SCR process.\nMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely used as the sacrificial template to construct various porous nanostructured metal–carbon composite materials [19–23]. It would be of unique advantage to synthesize Mn3O4–graphitic carbon composite using MOFs as the precursor: First, because of the uniform structure of metals and organic ligands in MOF precursor, strong interaction between Mn3O4 grains and graphitic carbon can be realized during pyrolysis, which can effectively regulate the electronic properties of Mn3O4; then, the small Mn3O4 grains can be confined in graphitic carbon, which is beneficial for inhibiting the sintering of Mn3O4 grains and exposing more active sites.\nInspired by the above considerations, we conducted this work with two aims: First, to design and synthesize a novel catalyst with graphitic carbon–modified Mn3O4 nanoparticles derived from Mn-based MOFs to be used for low-temperature SCR deNOx reaction; Second, to study the role and the origin of graphitic carbon on regulating the SO2 resistance of Mn3O4-based catalyst by combining the characterizations such as synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation (DFT)."

      "text" : "The Mn3O4@G-A catalyst was synthesized by a confinement–pyrolysis–oxidation strategy derived from that for Mn-BTC MOF precursor. In brief, Mn2+ doped on F-127 micelles can react with trimesic acid to generate Mn-BTC MOF grains in water/ethanol mixed–solvent. F127 works as a support material (which helps the fastgrowing MOF grains agglomerate together) as well as a soft templating agent. The as-synthesized MOF precursor is denoted as Mn-BTC-SA (“SA” represents the self-assembled structure of Mn-BTC). The crystal of Mn-BTC-SA (Mn3(BTC)2(H2O)6) can be confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and FTIR spectra (Fig. S1a–c) [32]. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. S1d) image shows MnBTC-SA has a self-assembled microsphere structure composed of MnBTC nanosheets. Mn3O4@G-A (“A” represents the assembled structure of Mn3O4@G) sample was obtained after the pyrolysis of Mn-BTC-SA at 900 °C, followed by oxidation at 300 °C, where the temperatures were pre-determined from the TGA and XRD results in Fig. S2–S5. The XRD pattern of Mn3O4@G-A exhibits the characteristic peaks of Mn3O4 spinel with space group I41/amd (JCPDS: 00-024-0734), along with the peak at 26.2° corresponding to graphitic carbon (JCPDS: 03-065-6212) (Fig. 1), indicating the successful synthesis of Mn3O4@G-A. High-resolution SEM (HRSEM) images (Fig. 2a–c) reveal that Mn3O4@G-A has an assembled nano-dandelion structure composed of nanorods with an average diameter of ∼100 nm. Such an assembled structure could promote the diffusion of reaction gases in SCR process [33]. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Fig. 2d) reveal the fringe spacings of Mn3O4 at 0.501 nm (101), 0.313 nm (112), 0.276 nm (103) and 0.255 nm (211), and those of graphitic carbon at\n0.347 nm (002). Additionally, the Mn3O4 nanoparticles are embedded into the graphitic carbon, leading to the small size of Mn3O4 grains (∼9 nm) and the close interaction between Mn3O4 grains and graphitic carbon. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images (Fig. 2e–h) reveal that the Mn, O and C species are well dispersed in the entire nanorod. Thermogravimetric analysis in air flow (Fig. S5) of Mn3O4@G-A indicates that graphitic carbon accounts for ∼14 % weight of Mn3O4@GA.\nFor comparison, Mn3O4-A (“A” represents the assembled structure of Mn3O4) was synthesized via pyrolysis at 700 °C followed by oxidation of Mn-BTC-SA at 300 °C. The XRD pattern (Fig. S6a) of Mn3O4-A shows the characteristic peaks of Mn3O4 spinel (JCPDS: 03-065-6212), which is consistent with the crystal of Mn oxide in Mn3O4@G-A. HRSEM images (Fig. S6b–c) reveal that Mn3O4-A has a uniform nano–dandelion morphology assembled by nanorods. HRTEM images (Fig. S6d–e) indicate that the nanorods in Mn3O4-A were composed of pure Mn3O4 spinel. Because of the aggregation of Mn3O4 grains, Mn3O4-A shows a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of 58m2 g−1 (Fig. S7), which is much smaller than that of Mn3O4@G-A (256m2 g−1, Fig. S8). The isolated graphitic carbon in Mn3O4@G-A (denoted as G-A) was obtained by treatment of diluted HCl. The carbon species of G-A can be confirmed by the XRD pattern (Fig. S9a). HRTEM images of G-A are illustrated in Fig. S9b–d. As shown in Fig. S9b–c, the graphitic carbon has a porous frame structure, which indirectly reflects that the Mn3O4 nanoparticles were embedded into the graphitic carbon frame. HRTEM image (Fig. S9d) confirms that G-A is composed of graphitic carbon, with the typical D-spacing of 0.34 nm, corresponding to the C (002) planes."

      "text" : "The oxidizing ability of Mn-based catalysts is closely related to its SCR performance [12]. The strong oxidizing ability of Mn oxide lies in the continuous production of surface-adsorbed oxygen (OS), which has strong oxidizing activity [34–36]. The ultimate source of OS in the oxidation process is O2, and activating O2 to continuously produce OS is crucial. Oxygen vacancies (OV) as well as the lattice oxygen defects play the role of activating O2. Therefore, the essential origin for the strong oxidizing ability of Mn oxide lies in its unstable surface lattice oxygen (OL) as well as its low OV formation energy [10]. Using the relative content of OV in fresh catalyst could indirectly reflect the difficulty to produce OV and the oxidizing ability of Mn oxide. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are shown in Fig. 3a–c. For O 1s spectra (Fig. 3a, Table 1), the binding energies located at ∼529.9, 531.4 and 532.9 eV are attributed to OL, OS and adsorbed surface H2O as well as the presence of OV, respectively [37]. The relative content of OS and OV in Mn3O4@G-A are significantly lower than those in Mn3O4A, indicating that the oxidizing ability of Mn3O4 in Mn3O4@G-A was weakened by graphitic carbon. To illustrate the interaction between Mn3O4 and graphitic carbon in Mn3O4@G-A sample, the C 1s XPS spectra of Mn3O4@G-A and GeA were provided in Fig. 3c. The characteristic peak of CeC bond in graphitic carbon over Mn3O4@G-A (284.8 eV) is shifted to higher binding energy in comparison to that for GeA (284.5 eV), indicating that the electrons were transferred from graphitic carbon to Mn3O4 over the Mn3O4@G-A sample [38,39]. The electron transfer from graphitic carbon to Mn3O4 could strengthen the Mn–O bonds and inhibit the production of OV, further leading to the relative weaker oxidizing ability of Mn3O4@G-A. For Mn 2p spectra (Fig. 3b), the binding energies of Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2 of Mn3O4@GA are found at 653.2 and 641.6 eV, which are ∼0.2 eV higher than those of Mn3O4-A, respectively, indicating that the valence states of surface Mn in Mn3O4@G-A is higher than that in Mn3O4-A. The higher valence states of surface Mn in Mn3O4@G-A can be attributed to the combined effects of OV content and electron transfer from graphiticFig. 1. XRD pattern of Mn3O4@G-A.\ncarbon to Mn3O4, because the lower content of OV in Mn3O4@G-A can lead to the increase in valence states of surface Mn, while the electron transfer from graphitic carbon to Mn3O4 can lead to the decrease in valence states of surface Mn.\nRaman spectra (Fig. 4) confirms the composition of Mn3O4@G-A. The peaks at 643, 347 and 296 cm−1 are characteristic of the Mn–O vibration modes of Mn3O4 [39]. The two peaks at ∼1326 and ∼1576 cm−1 originate from the defective carbon (D bond) and defined graphitic carbon (G bond), respectively. The high ID/IG ratio of 1.36 (area ratio) in Mn3O4@G-A indicates that the defective carbon (CGD) is widely present in the graphitic carbon.\nTo gain in-depth information on the interactions between Mn3O4 and graphitic carbon in our composite, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were recorded. The Mn L-edge XANES of Mn3O4-A and Mn3O4@G-A are shown in Fig. 5a, where the L3 and L2 peaks originate from 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 core states to 3d unoccupied states localized on the excited manganese ions, respectively. Both L3 and L2 peak positions of Mn3O4@G-A are shifted to higher energy, indicating that the valence states of the Mn atoms in Mn3O4@G-A is higher [40]. This inference can be further consolidated by the Mn K-edge XANES spectra in Fig. 5b. The Fourier-transformed (FT) EXAFS spectra (Fig. 5c) of Mn3O4-A and Mn3O4@G-A showed three main peaks at ∼1.5, 2.4 and 3.2 Å, corresponding to the Mn–O, Mn–Mn in edge-shared octahedra and Mn–Mn in corner-shared tetrahedra, respectively [41]. The higher ratio of the peak intensity at 2.4 Å to peak intensity at the 3.2 Å indicates that hexacoordinated Mn (Mn3+) is dominant on the surface of Mn3O4@GA, which can provide the basis for our calculation models. In addition,\nthe higher Mn–O peak intensity is in accordance with the larger coordination numbers of Mn3+ in Mn3O4@G-A. Generally, the high content of OV can intensify the other Mn-O bonds, leading to shortened Mn-O bonds. However, the Mn–O peak of Mn3O4@G-A with relative lower OV content is shifted to lower distance. Therefore, this can be attributed to the strong interaction between Mn3O4 and graphitic carbon. The electrons could transfer from graphitic carbon to Mn3O4, further strengthening the Mn–O bonds, which can also explain the lower content of OV over Mn3O4@G-A sample and is in consistence with the XPS results.\nSoft XANES of O K-edge and C K-edge were applied to gain insight on the interaction between graphitic carbon and Mn3O4, which is sensitive to the local chemical configuration around the probed element. The pre-edge regions (x and y) from 528 to 535 eV in O K-edge spectra (Fig. 6) are attributed to the hybridization of O 2p and Mn 3d states, and the splitting y signals (y1 and y2) can be attributed to the Jahn–Teller distortion induced by Mn3+ sites in Mn3O4 spinel [42,43]. The second region (z) centered around 542 eV is related to the projected unoccupied oxygen p states mixed with the manganese 4sp band at higher energy above the Fermi level [40,44]. And all the peaks fit well with those of pure Mn3O4 spinel. C K-edge XANES spectrum of Mn3O4@G-A is provided in Fig. 7. Besides the typical spectroscopic features of graphitic carbon at 285.3 eV (CeC π* transitions), 291.8 and 292.9 eV (CeC σ* transitions), a sharp peak is found at ∼288.5 eV, which can be assigned to the π bond between Mn3O4 and graphitic carbon, indicating the presence of strong interaction [45–48]. Two peaks at 289.4 and 290.2 eV are characteristic of chemical defects, and are attributed to the carbon atoms that are attached to either oxygen\natoms or nitrogen atoms, which provides direct evidence for the existence of Mn–O–CGD bond [49–51]."

Mn3O4@G-A showed good deNOx activity, N2 selectivity and SO2 resistance at low temperatures compared with the representative state-of-the-art catalysts (Table S1).\nAs illustrated in Fig. 8a, both Mn3O4@G-A and Mn3O4-A samples can reach 90 % NO conversion at 140 °C in 60, 000 h−1. Mn3O4@G-A showed a wide temperature window (T90) from 140 °C to 290 °C in 60, 000 h−1, and Mn3O4@G-A can reach 90 % NO conversion at 160 °C in the GHSV of 100, 000 h−1 (Fig. S10). The temperature dependences of NO reduction (NO conversion rates during SCR deNOx process; black curves) and NO oxidation rates (NO to NO2 oxidation rates; olive curves) are shown in Fig. 8b. It is found that both the NO reduction and NO oxidation rates of Mn3O4@G-A were lower than those of Mn3O4-A, respectively. Two conclusions can be drawn from the reaction rate results: First, Mn3O4@G-A has the weaker oxidizing ability than Mn3O4-A because of the modification of graphitic carbon on Mn3O4; Second, the intrinsic SCR deNOx activity of Mn3O4@G-A was weakened, which can be attributed to the lower NO oxidation rate of Mn3O4@G-A because it is widely accepted that “fast SCR” reaction (NO+NO2 + 2NH3 → 2N2 + 3H2O) is the crucial SCR deNOx pathway at low temperatures [15,16].\nThe N2 selectivity of Mn3O4@G-A and Mn3O4-A were also considered. As illustrated in Fig. 9, Mn3O4@G-A exhibits good N2 selectivity especially when the reaction temperature is lower than 180 °C. When the temperature is higher than 180 °C, the N2 selectivity decrease with the increase of temperature. As previous report, the primary path of N2O production is the side-reaction of NH3 oxidation (2NH3 + 2O2 → N2O + 3H2O) caused by the excessively strong oxidizing ability of catalysts [12]. Additionally, the lower N2 selectivity of Mn3O4-A can be assigned to its stronger oxidizing ability.\nThe result of stability test of Mn3O4@G-A is shown in Fig. 10a; it is found that Mn3O4@G-A can maintain ∼100 % NO conversion at 160 °C in the GHSV of 60, 000 h−1. There were almost no changes on the crystal (Fig. 10b) and O species (Fig. 10c) between fresh Mn3O4@G-A and Mn3O4@G-A after stability test, indicating that Mn3O4@G-A has a high stability and that an entire oxygen cycle exist in the reaction systems.\nSO2 resistance is crucial for low-temperature SCR deNOx catalyst, because the poor SO2 resistance is the key obstacle that limits their application. The results of SO2 resistance tests over Mn3O4@G-A and\nMn3O4-A are depicted in Fig. 11a. With the introduction of 50 ppm SO2 at 160 °C, the NO conversion of Mn3O4-A decreased from ∼98 % to ∼13 % in 8 h; by contrast, Mn3O4@G-A exhibited a significantly improved SO2 resistance, which could maintain a NO conversion above 80 %. The S 2p XPS spectra of the two samples after SO2 resistance tests (denoted as Mn3O4@G-A-SO2 and Mn3O4-A-SO2) were recorded. As illustrated in Fig. 11b, the peak at 168.5 eV is assigned to the surface SO32−, and the two peaks at 169.2 and 169.7 eV can be attributed to surface SO42− [14,52]. It can be found that SO32− is the primary S species on the surface of Mn3O4@G-A-SO2, whereas SO42− is the\nprimary S species on the surface of Mn3O4-A-SO2. To further confirm and quantify the S species on Mn3O4@G-A-SO2 and Mn3O4-A-SO2, temperature-programmed desorption in He flow (He-TPD, Fig. S11a) were performed, in which the desorbed or decomposed gases were online detected by mass spectroscopy (MS) (Fig. 11c, Fig. S11b, Table S2). As shown in Fig. 11c, a large amount of SO2 (2.48 molecule nm-2) and O2 (1.27 molecule nm-2) were simultaneous detected at ∼800 °C over Mn3O4-A-SO2. The high decomposition temperature of ∼800 °C is in accordance with the decomposition temperature of surface sulfate species [6,14,53]. And the molar ratio of SO2/O2 approximately equals to 2, corresponding to the element composition of SO3 as well as the decomposition product of surface sulfate species. Therefore, the peaks at ∼800 °C over Mn3O4-A-SO2 can be assigned to the decomposition of surface sulfate species. The surface sulfate species was formed primarily from the reaction between Mn3O4 and SO3 as well as the decomposition product of NH4HSO4, because the characteristic peaks of NH4HSO4 decomposition at∼328 °C were found in the TPD, NH3 MS and H2O MS curves in Fig. S11 [13,14]. Therefore, the formation of NH4HSO4 is the primary cause of deactivation of Mn3O4-A-SO2. For the SO2 and O2 MS curves of Mn3O4@G-A-SO2, the weak SO2 signal (0.54 molecule nm-2) at ∼600 °C can be assigned to the decomposition of surface sulfite species or chemisorbed SO2 [53]. No obvious sulfate species was found in both the XPS and He-TPD-MS results, indicating that the weakened oxidizing ability of Mn3O4@G-A can inhibit the oxidation of SO2 into SO3 and avoid NH4HSO4 formation, further contributing its high SO2\nresistance."

      "text" : "We have discussed that the electronic properties of Mn3O4 active\nsites could be tuned by the charge transfer between graphitic carbon and Mn3O4 through Mn-O-CDG bonds, further leading to the relative lower oxidizing ability of Mn3O4@G-A. Here, we conducted a series of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to reveal the structure–function relationship. The simplified Mn3O4(101)/CGD model with the interface between the defective graphitic carbon and the hexacoordinated Mn exposed (1 0 1) lattice plane of Mn3O4 was adopted, and the optimized Mn3O4(101) model with pure (1 0 1) lattice plane of Mn3O4 was used for comparison (Fig. S12). The optimized Mn3O4(101)/CGD model (Fig. 12a–c) revealed that Mn3O4 can connect with defective graphitic carbon through Mn–O–CGD bond (1.38 Å), which can provide direct channels for charge transfer, in consistence\nwith the C K-edge XANES results of Mn3O4@G-A. Charge density difference (Fig. 12d–f) was further explored to investigate the charge transfer between graphitic carbon and Mn3O4 over the Mn3O4(101)/ CGD model, where the yellow and blue bubbles represent gain and loss of electrons, respectively. The planar average charge density (z direction) of the charge density difference models (Fig. 12d–e) was presented in Fig. 12f. The two negative peaks at the positions (z direction) of ∼10.6 and 11.6 Å are attributed to the electron loss of graphitic carbon, whereas the positive peaks at the positions (z direction) of\n∼9.1 and 9.5 Å are attributed to the increased electron density of Mn3O4. Therefore, the electron transfer from defective graphitic carbon to Mn3O4 can be confirmed, corresponding to the inference from the C 1s XPS and Fourier-transformed (FT) Mn K-edge EXAFS results. Then, the vacancy formation energies of Mn3O4(101) and Mn3O4(101)/CGD models were calculated. There are two types of O site (denoted as O (A) site and O (B) site as illustrated in Fig. S13) on the as-built Mn3O4(101) model, and the lower vacancy formation energy of removing O (A) site was selected to compare with that of Mn3O4(101)/CGD model (Fig. S14). As shown in Fig. 12g, the vacancy formation energy of Mn3O4(101)/CGD (1.2 eV) is higher than that of Mn3O4(101) (1.0 eV), indicating that OV formation is more difficult in Mn3O4(101)/CGD model, which can explain that the relative content of OV in Mn3O4@GA is lower than that of Mn3O4-A. Further DFT calculation results (Fig. 12h and Fig. S15) indicate that O2 can be readily adsorbed on OV of both Mn3O4(101) (-0.4 eV) and Mn3O4(101)/CGD (-1.7 eV) models. During this process, one O atom of O2 recovers the OL, while the other O atom of O2 becomes the OS. On the basis of these two O2 adsorption models, the OS atom desorption energies (Fig. 12i) of both Mn3O4(101) (0.6 eV) and Mn3O4(101)/CGD (-0.5 eV) models are low, in consistence with the mobility of OS in the reports [25,34]. Over the entire oxygen cycle process, the formation of OV is the rate-determining step, which is directly linked with the oxidizing ability of samples. In conclusion, defective graphitic carbon can directly bond with Mn3O4 via Mn–O–CGD bonds, through which electrons can transfer from graphitic carbon to Mn3O4, leading to the strengthened Mn–O bonds, the higher vacancy formation energy and the weakened oxidizing ability of Mn3O4@G-A."

      "text" : "In summary, we designed an assembled Mn3O4@G-A composite catalyst through a confinement–pyrolysis–oxidation strategy using a novel self-assembled Mn-BTC-SA as the precursor. The Mn3O4@G-A catalyst shows a good SCR activity (T90< 140 °C) at low temperatures, benefiting from its assembled structure, small grain crystals, high specific surface area, and the appropriate oxidizing ability. More importantly, the Mn3O4@G-A sample exhibits a significantly improved SO2 resistance, and can maintain a NO conversion in above 80 % in the presence of SO2 at 160 °C. By combining synchrotron radiation-based Xray absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculation, the electron transfer from graphitic carbon to Mn3O4 through Mn–O–CGD bond was found, which can regulate the electronic properties of Mn3O4, leading to the higher vacancy formation energy and weakened oxidizing ability of Mn3O4@G-A in comparison to Mn3O4-A. The proper oxidizing ability of Mn3O4@G-A can inhibit the oxidation of SO2 into SO3, further avoiding NH4HSO4 formation. This is the most important origin for the high SO2 resistance of Mn3O4@G-A. In brief, our works report a novel Mn3O4@GA catalyst featuring a high activity and a remarkable SO2 resistance. In addition, the positive role and the origin of graphitic carbon in Mn3O4@G-A for improving SO2 resistance are unveiled. We believe that our work here provides new insights on the design and synthesis of assembled Mn-based catalysts with excellent activity and high SO2 resistance for SCR applications.\nSupporting information\nSupplementary Information related to this article is available.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nZhi Liu: Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review & editing, Writing - original draft.Minmin Wang: Investigation.

    "abstractText" : "The biggest challenge for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by NH3 at low temperatures is to develop robust catalysts with high resistance to SO2. Mn-based catalysts have attracted great attention for their excellent activity, but the poor SO2 resistance limits their application. Herein, we report a novel assembled composite featuring Mn3O4 nanoparticles embedded in defect-abundant graphitic carbon frame (Mn3O4@G-A) via a confinement–pyrolysis–oxidation strategy derived from MOF. The Mn3O4@G-A exhibits excellent activity (reaching over 90 % NO conversion in 100, 000 h GHSV at 160 °C) and significantly improved SO2 resistance in comparison to pristine Mn3O4, and all the performance tests were conducted with 5.6 vol.% water vapor. By combining synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation, we further discovered the positive role and the origin of graphitic carbon for improving SO2 resistance. Over the Mn3O4@G-A sample, the electrons can be transferred from graphitic carbon to Mn3O4 nanoparticles, which can regulate the electronic properties and oxidizing ability of Mn3O4 nanoparticles. The proper oxidizing ability of Mn3O4@G-A can inhibit the oxidation of SO2 to SO3, thus further avoid the formation of NH4HSO4 and improve the SO2 resistance. Our work here not only solves the current problem of poor SO2 resistance of Mn-based catalysts, but also provides new insights into the design and synthesis of MOF-derived graphitic carbon-containing catalysts for SCR applications.",
