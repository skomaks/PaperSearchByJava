      "text" : "In recent years, the use of a multimodal approach (see Glossary) for cancer management has become increasingly important. The preferred strategy has changed from monotherapy to multitherapy, enhancing treatment efficiency by combining cancer therapy and diagnosis. Nanotechnology is recognized as a key player that is expected to drive this profound transformation. Within this paradigm, two or more therapeutic agents can be associated into a single multifunctional nanomaterial to obtain the benefits of a bimodal or trimodal synergistic therapy. Moreover, drugs and contrast agents (CAs) can be coassembled to develop theranostic probes that can detect and cure tumors at the same time [1].\nOver the last decade, gold-based magnetic nanoparticles have attracted interest in the management of cancer disease by taking advantage of combined multiple diagnostic and/or therapeutic potentialities. The multifunctional character of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) is mainly attributable to the unique chemical–physical properties of these nanomaterials, which allow for customization of several diagnostic and therapeutic functions. The potential of AuNPs as a CA for cancer diagnosis has been studied for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after combining with spin-active CAs [2,3], X-ray computed tomography (CT) [4], surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) imaging [5], and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) [6].\nAuNPs also represent an efficient system for plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) [7], radiotherapy (RT) [8], and the delivery of drugs [9] and genes [10]. Recently, the potential of these nanocomplexes as theranostic systems with the opportunity of multitherapy for cancer control has been a key subject of investigation. This review highlights multiple potential uses of these Au-based nanotheranostic agents in order to face cancer.\nTrends in Biotechnology, September 2019, Vol. 37, No. 9 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2019.02.005 995 © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Biosafety: the inhibition of loss of biological integrity in large scale due to the effect of nanomaterials on human health. Human biosafety of nanomedicine is a major concern for clinical use. Cancer disease: a large number of diseases that involves abnormal cell proliferation and the ability to spread throughout the body. Cancer is the third leading cause of death in the world. Clinical translation: a research leads to superior development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches by way of measuring their impact in the human body. Hyperthermia: a cancer treatment modality in which elevated temperature is used to kill cancer cells and subsequently to destroy the tumor without significant side effects to surrounding healthy cells and tissues. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR): a unique optical characteristic of conductive nanomaterials produced by incident light-driven collective oscillation of conduction band electrons in nanomaterials of a size smaller than the wavelength of light. It is a powerful analytical technique in the determination of biomarkers, as well as being useful for photothermal therapy. Magnetic gold: a type of nanocomposite composed of gold nanomaterials and magnetic materials that shows the inherent properties of both materials. Multifunctional nanomaterial: an innovative nanoplatform in biomedicine that exhibits multiple functions to determine and treat diseases by acting as contrast agents and therapeutic agents for various imaging and therapy. Multifunctional nanoparticles are more effective for cancer management. Multimodal approach: the most effective approach in biomedical field consists of more than one diagnostic and therapeutic approach in order for precise identification as well as enhanced treatment of diseases. Despite the great potential of magnetic AuNPs for clinical translation, very limited perspective on this topic has been outlined so far [11–13]. The present report aims to provide an updated overview and critical insight into the recent literature, focusing on hybrid magnetic AuNP preparation, classification, chemical–physical characterization, and the advanced methodologies for combined cancer diagnosis and therapy. Concerns around the toxicity of these nanomaterials are also discussed in view of tangible transition into clinical practice. Preparation, Classification, and Chemical–Physical Characterization of Gold Nanomaterials The utilization of biocompatible gold nanostructures, including nanocluster, nanosphere, nanorod, and nanocage in biomedicine is more favorable compared with other inorganic nanomaterials, owing to their facile synthesis in aqueous solution, straightforward surface modification, and unique physicochemical properties [14–31]. The size and shape-dependent optical properties of gold nanomaterials, including fluorescence, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), and effective absorption of X-rays have been exploited to design multifunctional nanoprobes for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Several approaches have been reported for the synthesis of these gold nanostructures (Figure 1), however, we highlight here the most frequently employed wet methods (Table 1). The bright fluorescence of gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) from visible to near-infrared (NIR) spectral region is mainly capitalized on bioimaging applications. Nanoclusters are composed of several to hundreds of gold atoms and can be prepared either by bottom-up or top-down approaches [15,16]. In bottom-up methods, stable nanoclusters are obtained via reduction of gold salts in presence of thiol materials as strong capping agents or peptides as structuredefined scaffolds. The most commonly used reducing agent is sodium borohydride, however, sometimes the light is used to avoid hazardous chemicals. Conversely, the etching of AuNPs by thiol ligands produces AuNC in a top-down approach. The optical properties of synthesized AuNCs depend on their physicochemical characteristics, such as size, shape, and surface chemistry [15]. Gold nanospheres are probably the most widely explored colloidal nanoparticles in biomedicine and most of the reported methods for their synthesis are based on two original methods that were developed by Turkevich and Frens [17]. The reduction of HAuCl4 using sodium citrate in an aqueous solution produces AuNPs of different sizes, depending on the ratio of reducing agent to gold salt. In addition, a seed-mediated growth step is advantageous to obtain larger nanoparticles [18]. AuNPs are also prepared in a biphasic solution using a phase transfer agent and a capping surfactant [19]. The typical single LSPR peak of small roundshaped nanoparticles becomes wider and shifts from 520 nm to higher wavelengths upon increasing size [17]. Among various methods for the synthesis of gold nanorods (AuNRs) with controlled aspect ratio, a simple, highly efficient and reproducible seed-mediated growth method has been extensively exploited over the past decades [20,21]. This method involves the synthesis of small AuNPs by reduction of gold precursors (e.g., HAuCl4) to be used as seeds for subsequent growth of these seeds into nanorods in presence of growth solution. The anisotropic character of AuNRs results in two characteristic LSPR peaks, one associated to a transverse mode around 520 nm, which is fixed, while the second is relative to a longitudinal mode at 600– 1800 nm, which is instead dependent on the aspect ratio of AuNRs [20,21]. AuNRs exhibit higher photothermal conversion efficiency compared with spherical nanoparticles and are therefore more appropriate for photothermal therapy.\n996 Trends in Biotechnology, September 2019, Vol. 37, No. 9\nNanocomposites: highperformance nanomaterials made of two or more materials, which display typical properties of the individual materials. Nanostructures: a material of different dimensions, with size in the nanometer scale range. Noninvasive technique: a conventional medical technique that does not involve incision into the body or the removal of tissue during diagnosis as well as treatment. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI): photoacoustic effect based an emerging biomedical imaging modality that has high prospective in preclinical research and clinical practice. Photothermal conversion: a photothermal effect in which thermal energy (heat) is produced from the material when photoexcited by electromagnetic radiation. This produced heat is more promising for hyperthermia and responsive drug delivery. Photothermal therapy: a physicochemical therapy for cancer treatment in which released heat from photothermal agents (e.g., AuNPs) with high photothermal conversion efficiency under NIR laser irradiation kill cancer cells. Radiosensitizers: an agent including gold nanomaterials that achieves greater tumor inhibition by amplification of X-ray radiation doses. Radiotherapy (RT): a therapeutic approach using a high dose of ionizing radiation to destroy cancer cells and subsequently shrink the tumors, with limited side effects and high success rate. Theranostic: a new field of medicine in which simultaneous diagnosis and therapy are performed for the management of diseases. Tumor hypoxia: a state of solid tumors arising from an insufficient supply of oxygen in blood vessels that leads to resistance to radiotherapy as well as chemotherapy. Tumor microenvironment: the cellular environment where the tumor cells are surrounded by noncancerous cells, including fibroblasts, immune cells, proteins, and blood vessels. The tumor can alter this environment, while the environment can affect the growth of the tumor. Gold nanoshells can be generated using several colloidal nanomaterials, including silica nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), and quantum dots, which act as a template, by means of deposition of gold through chemical reduction of gold salts [22–24]. The gold layer on these core-shell nanoparticles has thickness-dependent enhanced tunable LSPR properties from visible to NIR region. In addition to their unique optical properties, the combination with the inherent properties of core materials offers the opportunity to develop an efficient multifunctional theranostics platform for cancer. The hollow interior and porous wall of gold nanocages are fabricated by deposition of reduced gold on the surface of a silver nanocube template followed by spontaneous oxidation of silver through galvanic replacement, producing a colloidal solution with LSPR peak in the range between 400 and 1200 nm [25]. These amazing nanostructures allow incorporation of therapeutic agents inside their cavity, making them candidates for cancer theranostics [14,25,26]. The progress in the synthesis and characterization of other gold nanostructures, including nanoplates, nanostars, and nanocubes, has been also well established in the last decades. Most popular methods used for the preparation of these nanostructures are chemical reduction and seed-mediated growth [27–31]. Their optical properties, including NIR LSPR peak, make them attractive forbiomedicalapplications. Consequently, synthesized gold nanostructures support the development of many different magnetic gold nanostructures (Figure 1) (Box 1) [32–45]."

      "text" : "A number of imaging techniques, including MRI, CT, and PAI, as well as therapeutic approaches, including PPTT, PDT, RT, chemotherapy, and hyperthermia therapy using magnetic gold nanocomposites, have been developed towards the diagnosis and treatment of several diseases, especially cancer (Figure 2). Imaging In view of an accurate detection of occult metastases and due to the need of tissue reconstruction after treatment of highly aggressive cancer, the development of newly designed complex biomaterials, imaging techniques, and specialized imaging probes to sensitively access detailed images of the 3D spatial distribution of malignancies seem vital. The imaging of tissues helps to differentiate the diseases states, such as tumors, from healthy environments. In addition, the progress of cancer therapy can be monitored by means of bioimaging. MRI is a noninvasive technique, widely employed in molecular imaging and medical diagnosis in the clinic [46]. CAs, including paramagnetic Gd(III) complexes for T1-weighted images and superparamagnetic IONPs for T2-weighted images, are frequently employed in MRI to enhance imaging sensitivityandaccuracy indiagnosis [47].Themagnetic relaxivitiesofCAsareconveniently improved by combination with plasmonic AuNPs in nanocomposites as a result of surface plasmon-driven enhancedmagneto-optical interaction [48].Thefruitful validationofmagnetic-goldnanocomposites as efficient CAs, for example, Gd(III)-DNA@gold nanostars and Gd(III)-labeled AuNPs, were demonstrated in MRI of pancreatic cancer with high contrast-to-noise ratios [49,50].\nAnother widely employed noninvasive imaging and diagnostic clinical technique is CT, which relies on the absorption of X-rays by tissues and is commonly recommended after or in concomitance with MRI [46]. Among recently developed nano-CAs, AuNPs are particularly favourable for CT owing to their intrinsic high X-ray absorption coefficient [51]. Indeed, various magnetic gold hybrids were extensively developed and used as CAs for preclinical identification of tumors by CT [52,53].\nTrends in Biotechnology, September 2019, Vol. 37, No. 9 997\nNanocluster Nanocage Nanoshell Nanoshell\nAR∼2.2 AR∼3.5 AR∼5.4 AR∼6.3\n5 nm\nNanostar\n8 nm 10 nm 16 nm\nRhombic dodecahedra Nanocub eNanoplate\nJanu s Janu s Core-s atell ite Core-shell\n10 nm 10 nm 10 nm 10 nm\n100 nm\n100 nm100 nm50 nm\nFigure 1.\n(Figure legend continued on the bottom of the next page.)\nTransmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Images of Various Gold and Magnetic Gold Nanostructures.

It benefits from converting the absorbed light into an outgoing thermoacoustic wave, thus offering a complementary approach to the established imaging techniques [54]. AuNPs have been suggested as CAs for PAI owing to their extremely high absorption of light in the NIR window [55]. For this reason, AuNR-bound magnetic nanoparticles were used in magnetically targeted PAI imaging of cancer [56].\nThanks to high sensitivity and accessible cost, optical molecular imaging is an emerging technique for examining the occurrence and progression of tumors [46]. For example, fluorescence optical imaging (FOI) and newly developed fluorescent biomarkers have been customized for real-time\nimages of gold nanorods with tunable aspect ratio from 2.2 to 6.3.

In addition, they have allowed for the multiplexed imaging of cancer foci detection and the evaluation of therapeutic outcomes [46,57]. Therein, biosynthesized complexes of AuNCs and iron with high fluorescence properties in the NIR region were more beneficial for early diagnosis of malignant tumors based on fluorescence imaging [57]. Twophoton luminescence (TPL) flourished as one of the most powerful bioimaging tools for imaging and tracking at the microscopic level with high resolution [58]. Due to plasmon modes of metallic nanostructures, AuNPs can be used as TPL emission resources for imaging of tumor microenvironment [59]. Plasmonic nanostructures significantly enhance thesignal of emission compared with a single fluorescent dye molecule [60]. Furthermore, magnetic AuNPs can improve surface plasmon oscillation and nonradiative decay of excited AuNPs by an effective magneto-optical coupling, which is suitable for multimodal imaging [48]. The nanocomposite of AuNPs with IONPs provided bright TPL images of cancer cells [61].\nSERS imaging is another promising and complementary optical modality for surface-sensitive biomedical imaging that allows visualization of molecular distribution in cells with high resolution\n1000 Trends in Biotechnology, September 2019, Vol. 37, No. 9\nExterna l s muli (e.g., li ght, mag ne c field, and X- ray)\nTarge ng liga nd Gold shell\nContrast age nt\nStabili zing age nt\nMag ne c core\nTherape u c age nt\nTumor site\nMul therapy Phototherm al therap y Photodynamic therap y Mag ne c hype rthermia\nRad iotherap y Chemotherap y Gene therap y\nMul fun c onal mag ne c gold nanomaterials\nTumor\nBlood vess el\nCombina on of mul ple imag ing\nand therap y\nMul - imaging Computed tomog rap hy Photoacous c imag ing\nMag ne c resonance imag ing Fluoresc ence imag ing\nSERS imag ing\nFigure 2.

Abbreviation: SERS, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.\n[62]. The SERS properties of AuNPs are more useful to enhance the sensitivity and specificity to determine intracellular cancer biomarkers accurately with very low noise-to-signal ratio and multiplexing capability [51]. Thus, AuNPs are an attractive CA for Raman imaging of cancer cells/tumors. Amendola and colleagues designed magneto-plasmonic nanoparticles (Au-Fe alloy) that allowed the identification of tumor by SERS imaging [63].\nTherapy Thanks to their easy surface functionalization and capability of thermal ablation of tumors, AuNPs are gaining popularity in view of an imminent clinical transition. According to their LSPR, AuNPs convert the absorbed laser beam into heat, which induces various biological phenomenon such as protein denaturation, apoptosis, and necrosis [51,64–66]. Consequently, the tumor cells are damaged and killed and then the tumor is destroyed. However, the application of NIR-assisted therapeutic methods remains challenging in treating deep tumors due to low tissue penetration of light [51]. Eyvazzadeh and colleagues demonstrated the potential of Au-coated IONPs with high NIR light absorption as a candidate for cancer photothermal therapy [67].\nRT is a crucial therapeutic mode for the treatment of nearly 50% of cancer patients [8]. Recently, much interest has been raised toward the application of AuNPs as radiosensitizers in RT of\nTrends in Biotechnology, September 2019, Vol. 37, No. 9 1001\ncancer, with special attention to hypoxic solid tumors due to various advantages of gold nanostructures, for example high absorption and efficiency in generating secondary electrons under g-ray or X-ray irradiation [68]. In fact, it has been shown that AuNPs with different sizes and shapes can significantly improve the effectiveness of radiation doses both in vitro and in vivo. Yang and colleagues demonstrated that the efficiency of RT depends on the sizedependent accumulation of magnetic AuNPs at the tumor site [69].\nPDT recapitulates important benefits such as negligible invasiveness, the capability of being specifically targeted, the possibility of administering repeated doses in contrast to RT, and minimal or absent scarring after healing [70]. Another advantage of PDT, which is beneficial for the patient, is the possibility of being performed in an outpatient or day-case setting without side effects [70]. Han and colleagues used Gd2O3-AuNC hybrids to sensitize the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) under NIR laser stimulation in PDT of cancer. The AuNC component in the Gd2O3-AuNCs hybrid enhanced the efficiency of PDT via increasing the production of 1O2 [71].\nHyperthermia has long been used to treat cancer. Hyperthermia kills or weakens the tumor cells by exposing the body tissues to high temperatures. Since tumor cells are more sensitive to heat compared with nondiseased cells, they could be more susceptible to chemotherapy or radiation therapy after hyperthermia treatment [51]. Similar to photothermal therapy, the increased temperature in magnetic fluid hyperthermia also induces numerous biological phenomenon (e.g., protein denaturation, apoptosis, and necrosis), which successfully damages and kills cancer cells [32,72]. Notably, magnetic hyperthermia therapy has important clinical benefits because of its ability to destroy deep tumor tissues in a noninvasive manner, taking advantage of wide spatial penetration of radiofrequency radiation produced by an alternating magnetic field [32]. Superparamagnetic AuNPs clusters showed typical superparamagnetic behavior and extraordinary magnetic hyperthermia effect, which is more favorable for cancer theranostics compared with simple photothermal therapy [73].\nIn the past half century, chemotherapy has been one of the most popular cancer treatment methods [74]. In conventional chemotherapy, delivery of the anticancer drug to tumor cells is performed by the circulatory system. Therefore, this method needs a higher concentration of the drug administered to the patient in order to reach tumor cells and since it is not tumortargeted, system toxicity and side effects of the drug are generally high [74]. Therefore, being able to deliver the drug to specific tumor tissues, nanoformulations become an attractive alternative to traditional chemotherapy. Magnetic-assisted drug delivery systems outperform other targeting techniques, exploiting a variety of energy sources such as electromagnetic fields and ultrasounds [75]. In magnetic-targeted drug delivery, the magnetic nanoparticle surface is modified with an appropriate biocompatible coating to allow drug loading. Therefore, highly accumulated drug molecules at the tumor site using an external magnetic field exhibit enhanced anticancer activity with limited side effects. The characteristics of AuNPs, such as plenty of preparation methodologies and ease of surface functionalization, make them potential candidates for modifying magnetic nanoparticles with versatile profunctional nanostations [51]. For example, Peng and colleagues reported a mesoporous gold-iron oxide nanocomposite for targeted delivery of drug to the breast tumor site by exposure to an external magnetic field [76]."

Biocompatible multifunctional gold nanomaterials endowed with active magnetic properties have successfully established their significant character as an effective CA in order to perform multimodal imaging, including CT, MRI, and FOI. For example, Wu and colleagues used Gd3+ ion-induced aggregated AuNCs inside silica with enhanced emission for in vitro and in vivo diagnosis of breast cancer by FOI, MRI, and CT imaging techniques, simultaneously [78]. In another study, gadolinium oxide-AuNC hybrids stabilized by BSA protein had greater contrast capability in trimodal imaging (e.g., CT, MRI, and FOI) of cervical cancer cells and in vivo system [71]. Wang and colleagues prepared a biocompatible spiky Fe3O4@Au supraparticle with enhanced NIR absorption, which efficiently served as an imaging agent for MRI, CT, and PAI of cervical cancer, simultaneously [79]. Therefore, such types of multifunctional magnetic AuNPs are more promising agents for the development of cancer theranostics via employment of their therapeutic aptitudes, such as photothermal therapy, RT, and magnetic hyperthermia."

In recent years, several such types of multifunctional nanomaterials offering the platform of multimodal image-guided cancer therapy have been reported (Table 2). For example, Li and coworkers reported multifunctional nanoparticles based on mesoporous silica-coated Fe3O4@Au nanoparticles loaded with anticancer drug doxorubicin followed by oligonucleotide capping for effective treatment of cervical cancer [80]. The enhancement of nanoparticle internalization and production of heat due to the photothermal effect of gold inside the tumor was achieved by application of an external magnetic field followed by NIR laser excitation, which facilitated the\n1004 Trends in Biotechnology, September 2019, Vol. 37, No. 9\ndrug release in a controlled manner. Therefore, collective anticancer activities exposed significant therapeutic effects on tumor tissue that allowed complete removal of the tumor after 14 days. Similarly, Ma and colleagues observed the higher therapeutic effectiveness of CDF-Au shell nanomicelle in cervical cancer treatment owing to the effects of photothermal therapy and magnetic field-guided drug delivery, simultaneously [81]. Bhana and colleagues investigated the effect of multimodal therapy in the presence of an external magnetic field in breast cancer treatment using gold-iron oxide nanopopcorns containing NIR-absorbing photosensitizer [82]. The in vitro studies exhibited that the gradient magnetic field accelerated intracellular uptake as well as the release of photosensitizer agent and as a result, the synergistic effect of photothermal therapies and PDTs improved anticancer activity compared with that without magnetic field. Recently, the combination of photothermal therapy with RT using gold-coated IONPs specifically induced a higher level of apoptosis in KB cancer cells, which is suitable for treatment of head and neck cancer [83].\nMagnetic Gold Nanomaterial for Multitherapy The integration of magnetic nanoparticles with gold nanomaterials, particularly AuNRs, into single nanoplatform is estimated to have a greater impact in cancer treatment (Table 2). In this section, we provide the effectiveness of these nanocomposites in the management of combination therapy for cancer. The drug-loaded nanocapsule (GNR@IOs-DOX) with superior magneto-plasmonic characteristic and stimuli-responsive drug delivery behavior presented a well-organized multifunctional system for effective cancer treatment [84]. The complete abolition of a breast tumor at the early stage without possible recurrence was attained through the combination of magnetically guided tumor homing of this nanocapsule and the dual effect of NIR laser triggered increased temperature and released doxorubicin. Hu and colleagues designed and prepared a successful multifunctional polycationic gold-iron oxide nanocomposite based on negatively charged polydopamine-coated IONPs and positively charged AuNRs\nTrends in Biotechnology, September 2019, Vol. 37, No. 9 1005\nto make complex with plasmid DNA for dual therapy of glioma cancer [85]. The combined application of photothermal and gene therapy had more potentiality in inhibition of high proliferation of glioma. A novel nanocomposite was developed by Yang and colleagues via decoration of plasmonic photothermal agent AuNPs and targeted agent Fe3O4 nanoparticles on black phosphorus nanosheet, which performed as photosensitizer [86]. A low-power NIR laser was sufficient to produce a combo of photothermal therapies and PDTs to cervical cancer cells that effectively inhibited the tumor growth. The multifunctional core-shell magnetic AuNPs (Au@FeS-PEG) with a strong NIR absorption property exhibited an excellent therapeutic function to overcome hypoxia-associated RT resistance by means of mild photothermal therapy-initiated enhancement of oxygen levels in the tumor microenvironment [87]. Therefore, the efficiency of RT was enhanced and this treatment modality was then further combined with photothermal therapy using this multifunctional nanoparticle, resulting in more efficient treatment of tumor hypoxia."

In this regard, nanoparticle-based platforms have been identified as valid tools for cancer theranostics. Therefore, multifunctional magnetic AuNPs containing both magnetic and optical properties have been rapidly developed to achieve an effective theranostic agent, advantageous for multi-imaging and multitherapy of cancer. Han and colleagues demonstrated that indocyanine green-loaded protein-stabilized gadolinium oxide-AuNC nanoplatform was more effective for multimodal imaging, as mentioned in the previous section, and this nanoplatform further improved PDT and PPTT [71]. Drug-loaded nanocapsules (GNR@IOs-DOX) also allowed for the diagnosis of the tumor by MRI and PAI techniques because of their magnetic and plasmonic properties [84]. Trimodal imaging (e.g., MRI, CT, and PAI) of the tumor using nanocomposite of AuNRs and IONPs having multiple therapeutic abilities was effective for cancer theranostic applications [85].\nAdditionally, several cancer theranostic agents composed of gold and magnetic materials have been reported through various types of combination, such as single therapy with single imaging, single therapy with multi-imaging, and multitherapy with single imaging.

Thus, this nanocomposite attained theranostic capacity specifically for triple-negative breast cancer. The core-shell theranostic nanoplatform composed of anticancer drug nanoparticles as a core and coated with a thin layer gold shell with magnetic IONPs was prepared to combine MRI and synergistic effects of PPTT and chemotherapy [89]. The Zhang research group developed g-Fe2O3@Au core-shell gold-iron oxide nanoflowers-based cancer theranostics, which allowed the precise determination of the tumor by multi-imaging techniques, including MRI, PAI, and SERS, as well as the efficient destruction of the tumor by PPTT [90]."

      "text" : "Evaluating the biosafety of nanomaterials is essential for their safe clinical application in the biomedical field. The toxicity of nanomaterials depends on their size, shape, surface chemistry, biological target, and time of exposure [91]. Over the past decades, several in vitro and in vivo toxicity studies have been performed to demonstrate the lower toxicity of individual AuNPs and magnetic nanoparticles [92–94]. However, the complete understanding of the toxic effects of magnetic gold hybrids to biological systems is still limited.\n1006 Trends in Biotechnology, September 2019, Vol. 37, No. 9\nOutstanding Questions What role does the size, shape, and composition of each material in nanocomposites have in developing a novel cancer theranostics with optimum magnetic and optical properties for effective cancer diagnosis and treatment?\nHow can we minimize the intrinsic toxicity of nanomaterials and mitigate the side effects of an overdose of therapeutic agents and external stimuli to healthy tissues and organs?\nWhy do the unique magnetic and optical properties of magnetic gold nanomaterials allow for enhanced multiple imaging and therapy?\nHow many imaging and therapeutic modalities are needed to develop multimodal cancer theranostics for the sensitive and selective early detection and effective treatment of cancer, including drug-resistant, hypoxic, and metastatic tumors, without any recurrence?\nHow can we modify the surface of magnetic gold nanomaterials with various agents (e.g., imaging, therapeutic, targeting, and stabilizing) of appropriate ratios to obtain highly colloidal stable and biocompatible multifunctional magnetic gold nanomaterials for targeted cancer therapy in the clinic?\nThe most recent studies aimed to elucidate the toxicological impact of magnetic AuNPs in vitro and in vivo, highlighting the safety profile of these nanocomplexes. The hybrid of gadolinium oxide-AuNCs employed for multimodal imaging had a negligible hemolytic effect and also higher cell viability [71]. Multifunctional therapeutic agents Au@FeS induced no observable toxicity to healthy mice [87]. Furthermore, gold-iron oxide nanocomposites such as Fe2O3@Au exhibited no significant toxicity on healthy tissues, including liver, heart, kidney, and lung [88,90,95]. As a result, these hybrids were successfully established as cancer theranostic agents in preclinical studies."

      "text" : "Multifunctional nanomaterials have significant benefits in biomedicine because of their effective synergistic diagnostic and therapeutic effects. In this review, we have summarized the design, preparation, and properties of multifunctional magnetic gold nanomaterials as cancer theranostics that support their use for both simultaneous diagnosis using multiple imaging techniques and treatment using multiple therapeutic approaches. For this purpose, the AuNPs are combined with magnetic materials via various chemical routes to make nanocomposites that show significant inherent physical and chemical properties of individual materials, for example, magnetic and plasmonic. These biocompatible nanocomposites are further modified for integration of other imaging and therapeutic agents (e.g., radioactive element and drug molecule) and biomolecules (e.g., peptide and antibody) in order to employ multimodal imaging of tumors to determine the cancer at an early stage without any false positive or negative results and complete destruction of tumors without any recurrence by more effective combined effects of multimodal therapy. Furthermore, the superior accumulation of theranostics agents inside the tumor via magnetically guided tumor homing of magnetic nanocomposites improves the efficiency of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Recent preclinical studies showed that due to the versatile physicochemical properties of magnetic gold nanomaterials, their applications in multimodal imaging and therapy of tumors overcome some of the limitations associated with individual approaches for cancer treatment. Though several preclinical studies demonstrated the higher theranostic efficiency of magnetic gold nanomaterials, some important aspects should nevertheless be considered for further improving their theranostic outcome and successive clinical translation (see Outstanding Questions).\nThe magnetic gold nanocomposites possess both magnetic and optical (e.g., plasmonic and fluorescence) properties and also these properties affect each other depending on the nature of each material. Furthermore, the sensitivity and resolution of the various imaging techniques and the efficiency of therapies are usually different. As a result, the composition of nanocomposites is a crucial factor in regulating their physicochemical properties and later the efficiency of multimodal imaging and therapy. Therefore, optimizing the physicochemical properties of nanocomposites by tuning their size, shape, and choice of nanomaterials is essential to enhance their performance.\nInorganic nanoparticles possess unique physical and chemical properties that are suitable for imaging and therapeutics, but these nanoparticles are also toxic to human healthy tissues and organs. This toxicity also depends on other parameters such as surface chemistry. In order to apply multifunctional magnetic gold nanomaterials in the human body, it will be important to evaluate their biosafety by monitoring the biodistribution, accumulation, and clearance of these nanomaterials in healthy tissues and organs. Moreover, to reduce the significant side effects in multimodal approaches that arise from combined imaging and therapeutic agents (e.g., radioactive elements and drug molecules) as well as external stimuli (e.g., high-power laser and ionizing radiation) during and after cancer treatment, several issues should be\nTrends in Biotechnology, September 2019, Vol. 37, No. 9 1007\ncarefully addressed. Some important goals include adjusting the minimum essential doses of imaging and therapeutic agents, enhancing the properties of magnetic gold nanomaterials to achieve therapeutic performance under biologically safe external stimuli, and selecting less harmful imaging and therapeutic modalities without any major compromise in the efficiency of cancer treatment. We are confident that solving most of these issues will bring this advanced new class of colloidal nanomaterials to maturation and prompt the transition toward a first-inpatient study."
