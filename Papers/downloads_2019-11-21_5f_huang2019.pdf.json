However, improvement is still necessary to reduce the consumption of Pt and obtain the quaternary Pt-based catalyst by Mo modification. Through the introduction of Mo(CO)6, novel quaternary hexapod nano-skeletons with high-index facets are obtained here, which are composed of core, first-layer feet and second-layer feet.

      "text" : "Though non-noble metal catalysts have received considerate attention and development, Pt-based catalysts are still necessary nanomaterials in the catalytic reactions due to their superior catalytic properties [1,2]. For current commercial Pt-based catalysts, the main challenge comes from limited Pt resources and high application costs. At the same time, it also faces the issue of poor catalytic activity, stability and anti-poisoning ability. To address these challenges, we consider the synthesis of binary, ternary or even multi-element low Ptbased catalysts by introducing other metallic elements [3–5].\nAmong various catalyst composition, binary and ternary Pt-based catalysts (e.g. Pt-Cu [6], Pt-Ni [7], Pt-Co [8], Pt-Pd [9], Pt-Ru [10], PtAu [11], Pt-Cu-Ni [12], Pt-Cu-Co [13], Pt-Co-Ni [14], etc.) have been broadly investigated in recent years and have shown enhanced catalytic performance, stability and anti-poisoning ability than commercial Pt/C catalyst. However, improvement is still continuous, and superior catalysts also need to be further studied. More and more researchers are beginning to understand the quaternary Pt-based catalysts and explore\ntheir applications in electrocatalysis [15,16]. To reduce the consumption of Pt and the cost of the catalyst, we have long been committed to developing Mo-modified multi-element Pt-based catalysts, and improve catalytic performance, stability and anti-poisoning ability of Pt-based catalysts.\nThe high-efficiency catalysts are mainly hollow spheres, nanoframes and nano-skeletons. For this type of catalytic material, they exhibit a highly open structure and efficient atomic utilization. Electron transfer and mass exchange are accelerated in electrochemical tests, which is very beneficial for improving catalytic performance. It is well known that carbonyl compounds (Mx(CO)y, M=Fe, Co, W, Mo, etc.) as surfactants and reducing agents play an important role in the preparation of many nanomaterials, such as the synthesis of nanowire [17], concave cube [18], nanorod [19], etc. Carbonyl compounds are popular in the synthesis of nanomaterials due to the presence of carbonyl groups in its organic composition [20–23]. In addition, carbonyl compounds are safe and convenient compared to CO gas, which is good for controlling the synthesis and growth of nanocrystals. Due to these advantages, carbonyl compounds are a great choice for our material synthesis [24].\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.117974 Received 20 February 2019; Received in revised form 11 July 2019; Accepted 17 July 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

Obviously, Mo(CO)6 also plays a significant part throughout the synthesis, and only PtCoNi NPs can be obtained in absence of Mo(CO)6. The quaternary PtCoNiMo NSs possess abundant tip areas with highindex facets, which can promote efficiency of electronic transfer and mass exchange. Therefore, the quaternary PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs exhibit efficient mass activity, stability and anti-poisoning ability for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), compared to commercial Pt/C catalyst and to PtCoNi NPs."

In N2-saturated 0.5M H2SO4 solution, the cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves were recorded at a sweep rate of 50mV s−1. The electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) were obtained by integrating the coulombic charges for hydrogen adsorption. As for CO-stripping measurements, the working electrode was held at -0.14 V vs. SCE, and the CV curves were then recorded in a 0.5M H2SO4 solution with a sweep rate of 50mV s−1. The MOR curves were recorded (-0.2 ˜ 1.0 V vs. SCE) under a scan rate of 50mV s-1 in a solution of 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0M CH3OH. The ORR polarization curves were recorded (0.05 ˜ 1.1 V vs. RHE) under a scan rate of 10mV s-1 and 0.1 M HClO4 solution.

      "text" : "In Fig. 1, a schematic diagram of the preparation and formation of PtCoNiMo hexapod nano-skeletons (NSs) can be seen. In a typical synthesis, Pt(acac)2, Ni(acac)2 and Co(acac)3 are used as reaction\nprecursors, glucose is used as reducing agent, and Mo(CO)6 is used as surfactant and reducing agent; all of them are dissolved in OAM reaction solvent by magnetic stirring [25]. Immediately after the sonication for 30min, a homogeneous mixed solution was obtained. The mixture was then transferred to an oil bath at 120 °C for 5 h. At the same time, the formation process of PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs is simply shown, and the nanocrystal structure undergoes some significant changes as the reaction time progresses. A more detailed evolution process of the nanocrystals is presented below.\nFor a better analysis of PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs, the typical TEM and HAADF-STEM images of PtCoNiMo nanocrystals display relatively uniform NSs (Figure S1). As shown in Figs. 2a-2d, , the structure of PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs can be clearly distinguished, while the structural characteristics of a single nanocrystal were further analyzed through HRTEM images. The atomic-scale HRTEM images obtained from the corresponding dotted squares, and the lattice spacing of 0.226 and 0.197 nm at the center and the tip areas can be recorded according to Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) imaging. Meanwhile, combined with the value of the lattice spacing, the basic crystal facets ({111} and {200}) are also confirmed. It is worth noting that abundant stepped atoms and different high-index facets are observed around the tip area (Fig. 2e), such as {211}, {222}, {311}, {711}, and {755}, which can\nboost electron transfer, mass exchange and performance improvement in the electrocatalytic reactions [26–29]. To clarify the specific morphology of the PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs, the TEM images obtained at different angles are analyzed (Figure S2). As shown in Fig. 2f, the PtCoNiMo nano-skeletons (NSs) are composed of a central core and first and second-layer feet; the same product can get different images from different perspectives.\nAs can be distinguished from the high-magnification TEM images (2g-2i), the first image shows 4 feet (Fig. 2g), the second image shows 5 feet (Fig. 2h), and the third image shows 6 feet (Fig. 2i). Through the rotation of the model, the corresponding NSs in the HRTEM images can be clearly observed, which also proves that the PtCoNiMo nanocrystals possess 6 feet [30]. In addition, the FFT images, insets in the TEM images, are clear and bright, indicating that PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs have good crystallinity. Moreover, the EDS mapping images show that the Pt, Co, Ni, Mo are evenly distributed on the PtCoNiMo NSs, and the Mo element is less relative to other metal elements (Figs. 2j & S3). The length of NSs is an important information datum, which has a certain reference value for evaluating the catalytic properties of materials. As shown in Figure S4, the PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs consist of three parts, including central core, first-layer and second-layer feet. The average length d1 of the central core is ˜5.83 nm, the average length d2 of first-\nlayer feet is ˜5.63 nm, and the average length d3 of the second-layer feet is ˜4.78 nm. This information shows that the first and second-layer feet occupy a large part of the size of the entire nanocrystal, which is very advantageous for the catalytic performance of the nanomaterial [31–33].\nThe XRD patterns of the PtCoNiMo hexapod nano-skeletons (NSs) were obtained in order to analyze the crystal structure (Fig. 3a). It is worth notice that the diffraction peaks of PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs are at 40.72°, 47.15°, 68.93° and 82.86°, which are closely related to some specific crystal facets based on the position of 2θ diffraction peak, including (111), (200), (220), and (311). Moreover, the XRD patterns of the PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs have a significantly positive shift compared to commercial Pt/C, and no impurity peaks were observed. The introduction of Co, Ni, Mo decreases the interatomic distances and redesign the electronic structure of Pt atoms. Meanwhile, the TEM-EDS spectrum shows that the atomic ratio of Pt/Co/Ni/Mo equals 49.7/ 19.8/22.7/7.8, and the results can be used as a reference to analyze the elemental composition (Fig. 3b). To further analyze the PtCoNiMo NSs, the XPS measurements were carried out. As shown in Figs. 3c & 3d, the XPS survey displays the atomic ratio of Pt/Co/Ni/Mo equals 75.4/8.5/ 13.6/2.5. It is worth noting that the materials have a 75.4% Pt atomic ratio, demonstrating that the PtCoNiMo NSs possess a Pt-rich surface. The Pt 4f area of PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs can be cleaved into Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2, the first group Pt 4f7/2 and Pt2+ 4f7/2 at 71.57 and 72.27 eV, and the other group Pt 4f5/2 and Pt2+ 4f5/2 at 75.07 and 76.38 eV, where the metal Pt is zero valence, and the metal oxides on the surface is divalent. Compared with that of pure Pt, the Pt 4f binding energy of PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs has an obviously negative shift, demonstrating that the electronic structure of Pt is redesigned.\nCombining the shift of Pt 4f, Ni 2p, Mo 3d and Co 2p spectra (Figures S5), we conclude that the electronic structures of Pt have been\noptimized and redesigned due to introduction of Co, Ni and Mo atoms [34–36]."

      "heading" : "3.2. Growth process analysis",
      "text" : "To carefully clarify the formation process of quaternary PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs, the morphological evolution of the nanocrystal was considered with the progress of reaction time. As shown in Fig. 4, Pt species are preferentially reduced and form nuclei due to standard redox potential in the entire reaction system, and then other species will gradually be deposited [37,38]. NPs (nanoparticles) were obtained when the reaction was carried out for 1 h. Generally, the surface energy of the (100) facets is greater than that of (111) facets, indicating that the latter is more stable. As the CO molecules adsorb on the top of Pt (111), the (111) facet becomes more stable, resulting in deposition of various species along a specific direction of< 100> [39–41]. In the subsequent growth phase, the reaction lasted for 2 h and the NP with the first-layer of feet was collected. As the reaction time progresses, the particle size of the nanocrystals increases, and the second-layer feet was formed due to excessive growth. After 5 h of reaction time, PtCoNiMo hexapod NS was synthesized.\nThe above discussion and investigation, further demonstrated that Mo(CO)6 is vital throughout the synthesis process and the formation of vertex-reinforced PtCoNiMo NSs structure is reasonable [42–44]. Mo (CO)6 is usually used to adjust the morphology as a structure directing agent, PtCoNiMo NSs can be obtained only in the presence of 5mg Mo (CO)6 in the reaction system, and the PtCoNi NPs were synthesized in the absence of Mo(CO)6. When 1, 3mg Mo(CO)6 was added, only a small amount of crystals with feet are obtained (Figure S6). The results further indicate that Mo(CO)6 plays an important role in the reaction system, and the PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs can be obtained when there is\nenough amount of Mo(CO)6."

      "heading" : "3.3. Electrochemical performance analysis",
      "text" : "Before the electrocatalytic measurements, PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs catalyst was loaded onto commercial carbon. As shown in Table S1, the mass activity of the catalysts was obtained based on Pt loadings. Meanwhile, commercial Pt/C catalyst is used as a basic standard for comparing the catalytic performance of other catalysts. In Fig. 5a, a schematic diagram of MOR and ORR processes is depicted, indicating ORR at the cathode and MOR at the anode are important in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), therefore, their catalytic performance is investigated in the following electrochemical measurements.\nAs seen in Fig. 5b, CV curves are obtained using a N2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution and recorded at a scan rate of 50mV s−1. The ECSAs are calculated by the integration of hydrogen adsorption peak area from the CV curves of Pt/C (35.1m2 gPt−1), PtNiCo (43.8 m2 gPt−1) and PtCoNiMo (48.7 m2 gPt−1). The CO-stripping curves were also recorded at a scan rate of 50mV s−1, and the peak potential of PtCoNiMo NSs (0.485 V) exhibited a more negative potential, compared to PtCoNi NPs (0.504 V) and to commercial Pt/C (0.594 V) (Fig. 5c). The ratios between forward-scan and back-scan peaks are 0.98, 0.83 and 0.66 for PtCoNiMo NSs, PtCoNi NPs and Pt/C catalysts, respectively. The results further indicate that PtCoNiMo NSs catalyst exhibits enhanced anti-poisoning ability compared to Pt/C and PtCoNi NPs (Fig. 5d). Based on the oxidation peak intensity and Pt loadings for PtCoNiMo NSs (6.15mA, 17.4 μgPt cm-2), PtCoNi NPs (6.44 mA, 19.4 μgPt cm-2) and Pt/C catalysts (2.59 mA, 30.6 μgPt cm-2), the PtCoNiMo NSs displayed for MOR a better mass activity (1.82 A mgPt−1), which was 4.2 times greater than that of commercial Pt/C (0.43 A mgPt−1) (Fig. 5f). In addition, the PtCoNiMo NSs have a more negative onset potential than other samples. The results show that PtCoNiMo NSs possess enhanced MOR catalytic activity and anti-poisoning ability than commercial Pt/C.\nThe ORR polarization curves were obtained under a scan rate of 10mV s−1 in a 0.1M HClO4 solution. Compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.15 A mgPt-1), the PtCoNiMo NSs (0.45 A mgPt-1) and PtCoNi\nNPs (0.22 A mgPt-1) showed more positive onset potential and enhanced ORR catalytic activity at 0.9 V vs. RHE (Figs. 5e & 5f). The catalytic performance of the PtCoNiMo NSs catalyst should be attributed to the vertex-reinforced nanostructure, the Pt-rich surface and the introduction of Mo [8,14,45].\nThe durability of PtCoNiMo nano-skeletons (NSs) catalyst for MOR was measured through performing 1000 cycles of ADTs (Figs. 6a, S7 & S8). As seen in Figs. 6b & S9b, the mass activity of commercial Pt/C catalyst was reduced to 67.1% of the initial value after 1000 cycles, while the PtCoNiMo NSs catalyst was only reduced to 83.5% of the initial value. The results indicate that the PtCoNiMo NSs catalyst has an efficient mass activity, and the mass activity of PtCoNiMo NSs catalyst cam still reach 1.51 A mgPt−1, which was 5.2 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst (mass activity of 0.29 A mgPt-1). In addition, the stability of PtCoNiMo NSs catalyst for ORR was investigated by using ADTs for 10,000 cycles (Figs. 6c & S10)c [46,47].\nThe TEM images and EDS atomic ratios of PtCoNiMo NSs before and after 10,000 cycles are shown in Figs. S11(c & d). The tip areas of PtCoNiMo NSs was slightly destroyed after the ADTs, and a large amount of Co was dissolved, resulting in the decrease of mass activity. As shown in Figs. 6d & S12, after 10,000 cycles the mass activity of PtCoNiMo NSs catalyst was reduced to 77.8% of the initial value, while the commercial Pt/C catalyst was reduced to 40.1% of the initial value. Remarkably, compared with the PtCoNi NPs, the PtCoNiMo NSs catalyst showed enhanced mass activity, stability and anti-poisoning ability for MOR and ORR due to the introduction of Mo and vertex-reinforced structure [45]. Based on the above discussion, the stability of the quaternary nano-skeletons catalyst is improved compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts and PtCoNi NPs. In our mind, the improvement in stability is mainly due to the following two points: 1) the Mo-modified multi-catalyst via alloying treatment is more stable than pure Pt catalysts and 2) the vertex-reinforced nano-skeletons structure is active than NPs due to better electron transfer and mass exchange. In addition, the quaternary catalyst still needs improvement, and the PtCoNiMo ND as superior bifunctional catalyst is promising in future work."

Meanwhile, the quaternary hexapod NSs are composed of core, first-layer feet and second-layer feet. The formation process of PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs is also analyzed with the progress of reaction time. Based on the advantages mentioned, compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst and PtCoNi NPs, quaternary PtCoNiMo hexapod NSs exhibit efficient mass activity, stability and anti-poisoning ability for MOR and ORR. More meaningfully, quaternary catalysts can offer more possibilities for the performance improvement of Pt-based catalysts.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."

However, improvement is still necessary to reduce the consumption of Pt and obtain the quaternary Pt-based catalyst by Mo modification. Through the introduction of Mo(CO)6, novel quaternary hexapod nano-skeletons with high-index facets are obtained here, which are composed of core, first-layer feet and second-layer feet. Compared with PtCoNi nano-particles (NPs), the vertex-reinforced PtCoNiMo hexapod nano-skeletons (NSs), due to abundant tip areas, can facilitate electron transfer and mass exchange. It is found that the as prepared PtCoNiMo nano-skeletons catalyst exhibits enhanced mass activity, stability and anti-poisoning ability towards methanol oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction, compared to commercial Pt/ C catalyst and PtCoNi nanoparticles. More importantly, the development of quaternary catalysts can create better possibilities for the performance improvement of Pt-based catalysts.",
