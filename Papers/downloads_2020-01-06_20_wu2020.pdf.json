Surface modification and incorporation of bioactive fillers are effective strategies to promote the cellular responses of PEKK implants and their integration with bone tissues. In this study, silicon nitride (SN) microparticles were blended with PEKK to develop bioactive composite implants (SPC). Femtosecond laser was then used to modify SPC surfaces inducing favorable micro/nano structural surface (FSPC). After the laser ablation, irregularly shaped SN microparticles were converted to “petal-like” clusters composed of “pin-like” SN nanoparticles, while the entire surface was covered by SN particles due to the removal of PEKK. The roughness, hydrophilicity, content of surface chemical groups (e.g., -NH2), and protein adsorption capability of FSPC were significantly enhanced compared to SPC and PEKK. Also, the release of biologically active Si ions was increased after the femtosecond laser treatment, inducing a positive microenvironment favorable for cellular activities. Moreover, FSPC exhibited a greater bacteriostatic activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) than SPC. The presence of micro/nano structure also remarkably promoted adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of rat bone mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs). In vivo evaluation of the composites in a rabbit femur defect model verified that FSPC could enhance osteogenesis and osseointegration to a greater extent than SPC, evidenced with greater bone-implant contacts and push-out force. These results indicate that the femtosecond laser induced micro/nano structural surface on SN/PEKK implants can significantly promote osseointegration and bone repair. The femtosecond laser exhibits great potential in surface modifying bioceramic/polymer composites. The fabricated FSPC have shown great potential as bone implants in orthopedic applications considering their excellent biocompatibility, bacteriostatic property, osteogenic activity, and osseointegration.\n© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) is gaining increasing attention as an implanted biomaterial because of its favorable physical-chemical and mechanical properties [1,2]. Moreover, more ketone groups are available in PEKK in comparison to PEEK, facilitating further surface functionalization [2]. However, PEKK is biologically inert exhibiting weak osteogenic activities [1]. PEKK is usually wrapped by fibrous connective tissues after being implanted into the body, which hinders the integration with the host bone tissues in vivo and causes poor osseointegration [2]. Therefore, promoting the osteogenic activity and osseointegration of PEKK is of the utmost importance to its effective orthopedic applications.\n2 ed Ma\nc r o u p i p M u e f\ne t B p t p a t p i r d t e g s t c t b w I a f a n t b d m c m l p r s u n a t S t i s t s\ni a a T b m\nH. Wu, T. Liu, Z. Xu et al. / Appli\nSilicon nitride (SN), a well-known structural ceramic, is haracterized by its great mechanical strength and excellent corosion resistance [5,6]. SN also shows excellent biocompatibility, steogenic potential, and antibacterial property, which has been sed for biomedical applications since the 1990s [5–7]. For examle, SN has been used to fabricate spinal fusion devices and ntervertebral discs [8–10]. SN can also promptly adsorb serum roteins, a key step for consequent cell adhesion and growth [11]. oreover, some functional groups, such as -NH2 and -OH, can natrally form on SN surfaces under physiological conditions, which ndows SN with high hydrophilicity and the possibility of surface unctionalization [5,6].\nIncorporation of bioactive fillers and surface modification are ffective strategies to promote osteogenic activity and osseoinegration of bioinert implants, including PAEK based implants. ioceramics (e.g., calcium phosphate) and bioactive glasses (BG) ossess excellent osteogenic activity [12,13], whose combinaion (either as fillers or coatings) with PAEK can significantly romote osteogenesis and osseointegration that ensure early fixtion and long-term stability of implants in vivo [14,15]. Due o the beneficial physicochemical and biological properties, SN articles have shown great potential as multifunctional buildng blocks for composites and orthopedic coatings in hard tissue epair/regeneration applications. For example, Wang et al. [16] eveloped SN/poly(methyl methacrylate) composites for denal restoration. The incorporation of SN in PMMA resin greatly nhanced the initial adhesion and spreading activity of Human ingival fibroblast cells. Besides incorporation of bioactive fillers, urface modification towards creating specific micro/nano strucures (e.g., nanoporous, microgroove) can also positively modulate ellular responses leading to enhanced osteogenesis and osseoinegration [17–19]. For example, micro/nano porous structure could e induced on PEEK or PEKK surface by acid etching [1,20], hich could promote cell adhesion and in vivo osseointegration. n our previous work, we etched PEKK implants with SN/sulfuric cid suspension, which induced porous SN/PEKK composite surace and significantly enhanced the osteogenic and bacteriostatic ctivities as well as osseointegration of PEKK implants [20]. Alteratively, implant surfaces can also be modified by laser [17,21], hrough which specific surface patterns or porous structure could e induced. Femtosecond laser, one of the most potent laser tools eveloped in the past 20 years [22], has been preferably used in icromachining field due to its high power, great processing preision, and limited thermal damage to various materials including etals, ceramics/glasses, and polymers [23–25]. Compared to other aser technique (e.g., nanosecond laser), the femtosecond laser is referred for surface modification due to its higher precision and educed heating effects leading to less debris around the ablated pots on the material surface [17,21]. The femtosecond laser can be sed to induce various micro/nano structures (e.g., microgroove, anoporous) on titanium and PEEK implants and promote cell dhesion as well as osteogenic differentiation [17,24,26]. Moreover, he femtosecond laser can also modify ceramic surfaces (including N). For example, nanoscale parallel grooves have been created on he surface of SN/TiC composites by the femtosecond laser [27]. The nfluence of femtosecond laser induced micro/nano structural SN urfaces on cellular responses has not been comprehensively invesigated. However, acid-etching induced porous surfaces on SN have hown promoted osteogenic and antibacterial activities [6].\nIn this study, we first incorporated SN microparticles into PEKK mplants to enhance the bacteriostatic activity and osteogenic ctivity of PEKK. SN particles have shown greater antibacterial ctivity, osteogenesis, and osseointegration than PEEK and Ti [9]. he combination of SN and PEEK/PEKK has shown enhanced one repair effects [20,28]. It is known that induction of specific icro/nano surface structures on implants can enhance cellular\nterials Today 18 (2020) 100523\nperformance and particularly osseointegration, ensuring early fixation and long-term stability of implanted materials in vivo [29]. We thus explored the possibility of applying femtosecond laser, a technique rarely used to modify the surface of composite implants, to induce specific micro/nano structural surface on the SN/PEKK composites (SPC) for promoting bacteriostatic activity, osteogenic responses and osseointegration. To prove these hypotheses, we comprehensively evaluated the surface structure and properties, rat bone mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) responses, and antibacterial activity of the femtosecond laser treated SN/PEKK implants (FSPC) as well as those of PEKK and SPC. Moreover, in vivo bone repair and osseointegration of the implants were also evaluated in a rabbit femur defect model.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Fabrication and characterization of FSPC\nSN/PEKK composites (SPC) were prepared by physical mixing of PEKK and SN, compression molding, and sintering. Briefly, PEKK (OXPK-C, Oxford Performance Materials, UK) powders (∼20 m) were added into ethanol at a concentration of 0.1 g/mL and stirred for 1 h. Then, mixtures of SN and PEKK (PEKK:SN = 50:50, vol%) were prepared by adding SN powders (∼3 m, phase, 99.9 % metals basis, Aladdin Industrial Co., Ltd., China) into PEKK suspension under stirring for 3 h. After drying at 80 ◦C for 24 h, the mixtures were placed into stainless steel molds of different dimensions and compressed under a pressure of 5 MPa. The specimens were then sintered at 355 ◦C for 6 h to obtain SPC. PEKK samples were prepared as control by using the same method described above. The surface of SPC samples was then irradiated by a femtosecond laser instrument (GLX-200HP-1053, Time-Bandwidth Products AG, Switzerland) with the processing parameters of pulse width 120 fs, power 20 mW, and scanning speed 800 m/s to obtain FSPC.\nThe surface morphology of samples (Ф10 mm × 2 mm) of PEKK, SPC, and FSPC was observed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan), while the 3D surface morphology and roughness of the samples were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Multimode8, Bruker, German). The surface chemical structure of the samples was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR, Nicolet 6700, Nicolet, USA), X-ray diffractometer (XRD, max2550VB/PC, Rigaku Co., Japan), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Co., UK). The hydrophilicity of the samples was determined using a contact angle measurement (JC2000D2, Shanghai Zhongchen Digital Technology Equipment Co., Ltd., China). The compressive strength of PEKK, SPC, and FSPC ( 12 × 10 mm) was tested by utilizing a universal material machine (E44.304, MTS Co., China) under ambient condition. The compressive strength was determined from the peak of the stress–strain curve.\n2.2. Protein adsorption\nProtein adsorption of the samples was evaluated by using the model bovine serum albumin (BSA). Briefly, the samples (Ф10 mm × 2 mm) were placed into 10 mL of BSA-PBS solution (100 g/mL) in an incubator (HAJ-3-160, Shanghai Yuejin Medical Devices Co., Ltd., China) at 37 ◦C for 24 h. Then the samples were taken out and washed with PBS three times to remove loosely adsorbed proteins. After that, 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate solution (SDS) was added and shaken for 20 min to detach adsorbed BSA from the sample surfaces. The protein concentration of the collected SDS solution was determined at a wavelength of 280 nm by NanoDrop 2000C device (Thermo Scientific, USA).\nd Mat\n2\nt fl e p C t c e t d\n2\nw F T G h e t\n2\nc d 6 J C n t d 7 t\n2\nu d s d a f w c b\n2\no f s p i t c g M w w a\nH.

Ion release and pH change\nThe ion release behavior of the samples (Ф10 mm × 2 mm) and heir influence on pH values after immersion in simulated body uid (SBF, Beijing Leagene Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) were valuated. Briefly, the samples were immersed in 10 mL of SBF and laced into an oscillator (HZQ-X300, Yiheng science instruments o., Ltd., China) at 37 ◦C for different times. At every predetermined ime point, 1 mL of supernatant was collected for determining the oncentration of Si ions by using inductively coupled plasma atomic mission spectrometer (ICP-AES Agilent Co., USA). The pH value of he solution was recorded by a pH meter (FE20, Mettler Toledo) uring the immersion of the samples.\n.4. Evaluation of in vitro cellular responses\nrBMSCs extracted from male SD rats (Sprague Dawley, 4 weeks) ere used to evaluate in vitro cellular responses of PEKK, SPC, and\nSPC (Ф10 mm × 2 mm). rBMSCs were cultured in -MEM (Gibco, hermoFisher Scientific, USA) with fetal bovine serum (FBS, 10 %, ibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) under an atmosphere of 95 % umidity and 5 % CO2 at 37 ◦C. The culture medium was changed very 3 days. The samples were sterilized by ethylene oxide before he cell experiments.\n.4.1. Cell adhesion and morphology rBMSCs were seeded on the samples at a density of 4 × 104 ells per well in 24-well plates and cultured for 1 day and 3 ays. The samples were then stained with 2-(4-Amidinophenyl)-indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride (DAPI, Beyotime Biotech, iangsu, China) and FITC-phalloidin (Beyotime Biotech, Jiangsu, hina) for observing the cell morphology under confocal laser scaning microscope (CLSM, A1R, Nikon Co., Japan). The morphology of he adhered cells on the samples was also observed by SEM after ehydrating the samples in gradient ethanol solutions (10, 30, 50, 0, 85, 90, and 100 %, respectively) for 10 min and drying at room emperature.\n.4.2. Cell proliferation The proliferation of rBMSCs on the samples was evalated by using the MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5iphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. rBMSCs were cultured on the amples at a density of 4 × 104 cells per well for 1 day, 3 and 5 ays. At each specific time point, the culture medium was removed nd the samples were washed 3 times with PBS. Then 300 L of -MEM and 120 L of MTT solution were added into the medium or a further 3 h of culture. After that, the medium was replaced ith 500 L dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma, USA) for 30 min. The optial density (OD) values at a wavelength of 490 nm were recorded y a Microplate Reader (PathTech, Australia).\n.4.3. Alkaline phosphatase activity Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity is a marker of early steoblast differentiation, indicating the degree of osteogenic diferentiation. The ALP activity of rBMSCs after culture with the amples was evaluated. Briefly, rBMSCs were seeded onto the samles at the density of 4 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates. After ncubation for 7, 10, and 14 days, 200 L of 1 % Nonidet P-40 soluion was added on the samples and incubated for 1 h. Then the ell lysate was obtained after incubation with 2 mg/mL pNPP (Sanon, Shanghai, China) solution, 0.1 moL/L glycine and 1 mmol/L\ngCl2·6H2O solution for 30 min at 37 ◦C. Afterward, the reaction as quenched by adding NaOH solution (0.1 mol/L). ALP activity as measured spectrophotometrically with a microplate reader at wavelength of 405 nm. The total protein content in the cell lysate\nerials Today 18 (2020) 100523 3\nwas determined using the bicinchoninic acid using the Pierce protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., USA) at the wavelength of 562 nm. The ALP activity was normalized to the total protein content.\n2.4.4. Alizarin-red staining and quantitative analysis After 28 days of culture, all the samples were washed with PBS, and the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde (Sigma, USA) for 15 min. After that, the alizarin red solution (Solarbio, China) was added and stained for 25 min. Then the samples were washed with PBS and observed by optical microscopy. In order to quantitatively analyze calcium nodules on the samples, cetylpyridinium chloride solution (10 %; Cyagen, Guangzhou, China) was used to desorb the stain on the samples. The OD values were measured at 620 nm using a Thermo Scientific microplate reader (Multiskan, MA, USA).\n2.4.5. Osteogenic related gene expression The effects of the samples on the osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs were assessed by using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to measure the mRNA expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin (OPN), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and osteocalcin (OCN). The primer sequences applied for the RT-PCR study are shown in Table 1. Briefly, rBMSCs were seeded on each sample at a density of 4 × 104 cells per well in 6-well plates and cultured for 3, 7, and 14 days. The total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Australia). Complementary DNA was reverse-transcribed from 1 mg of total RNA applying Superscript III (Invitrogen, USA). The expressions of these genes were quantified applying Real-time PCR (ABI Prism 7900 H T sequence detection system) with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA). The mean cycle threshold (Ct) value of each target gene was normalized against the Ct value of GAPDH (a housekeeping gene) to obtain the relative expression of the genes.\n2.5. Bacteriostatic activity\nThe bacteriostatic property of PEKK, SPC, and FSPC was evaluated by using the bacteria counting method. All the samples (50 mm × 50 mm × 2 mm) were sterilized by ethylene oxide before the experiments. Briefly, 50 L of E. coli (ATCC 25922) and S. aureus (ATCC 25923) (5 × 106 CFU/mL) were respectively added on the sample surface before culture at 37 ◦C for 24 h. After that, the samples were vigorously washed with certain amounts of sterilized PBS to detach the bacteria from the samples. The resulting PBS was then diluted with sterilized PBS. Finally, 100 L of diluted PBS was transferred to Luriae-Bertani agars and tryptic soy broth agar before culture at 37 ◦C for 24 h. The active bacteria were counted according to the National Standard of China (GB/T 4789.2 protocol). The relative bacteriostatic rate was calculated using the following formula:\nBacteriostatic rate (%) = ( Rcol − Rexp )\nRcol × 100%\nWhere Rcol represents the average value of colonies for PEKK and Rexp represents the average values of colonies for SPC or FSPC.\n2.6. In vivo osteogenic activity and osseointegration\n2.6.1. Animal surgery\nNew Zealand white rabbits (approximate 2 kg in weight and 3 months in age) were used for the in vivo evaluation of bone repair and osseointegration of the samples in a rabbit femur cavity defect model. The surgical procedure was approved by the Animal Exper-\n4 H. Wu, T. Liu, Z.

All the samples (Ф5 mm × 5 mm) were sterilized by - ay radiation (15 KGy) before the surgery. The rabbits were assigned andomly to three groups corresponding to the samples (PEKK, SPC, nd FSPC). The defects (5 mm in diameter and 5 mm in depth) in the istal part of the femur were generated by a medical electrical drill, nd the samples were implanted into the defects immediately. At eek 4 and 12 after surgery, the rabbits were sacrificed, and the\none defects with implanted samples were harvested and fixed by .5 % glutaraldehyde solution.\n.6.2. SRmCT and Micro-CT analysis The repair of bone defects was evaluated by SRmCT (Syn-\nhrotron Radiation Micro-CT) at week 4 and 12 after the mplantation. The SRmCT measurement was carried out at beamine BL13W1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, hanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, China) with a monochroatic beam (energy of 30 keV). The distance from the detector o the bone samples was 0.9 m and the X-ray signal of the harested bone samples was recorded by a detector (Photonic-Science ompany, Britain). An Amira software program (Visage Imaging, ustralia) was used to construct 2D and 3D images from the 8- it images. The formation of new bone tissues around the implants as evaluated by using a Micro-CT scanner (Skyscan 1076, Skyscan, elgium) under the condition of voltage: 40 kV, current: 250 A and esolution: 35 mm. The cylinder area (5 mm × 5 mm) of the femur amples containing implants was selected as the interesting region. he bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) and bone mineral density BMD) were quantitative determined by CTAn program (Skyscan ompany, Belgium).\n.6.3. Histological analysis and push-out test The fixed specimens containing bone-implant were trimmed\nnto small ones, which were dehydrated in ascending series of thanol and embed into poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA). A Leica P1600 saw microtome (Leica, Hamburg, Germany) was used to repare the histological sections with a thickness of 150 m. The istological sections were polished (thickness ∼50 m) and stained y Van Gieson’s (V&G) picro fuchsin. Inverted microscope (TE2000, Nikon, Japan) was applied to observe the stained sections and mage-Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, USA) was used o determine the percentage of bone-implant contact (BIC). A uniersal material testing system (Instron, HighWycombe, UK) was sed to perform the push-out test, and the loading rate of test force as set as 5 mm/min. During the pushing period, the load-time urves were recorded, and the peak load values were recorded to efine the push-out force.\n.7. Statistical analysis\nThe experiments were independently carried out in triplicates, nd the results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.). ne-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test was used to analyze ll data. *p<0.05 represented that the differences were considered tatistically significant.\n3. Results\n3.1. Femtosecond laser ablation induced micro/nano structural surface\nThe surface morphology and roughness of PEKK, SPC, and FSPC were characterized by SEM and AFM. SEM images of PEKK (Fig. 1a and b) reveal a macro-rough surface that was a typical morphology of sintered PEKK or PEEK implants [9,30] while no embedded powders were visible. After the incorporation of SN particles, the surface morphology was at variance with that of PEKK and nanostructural surface features were observed. Some embedded SN particles with irregular shapes and sizes in 2−5 m were observed on the SPC surfaces (Fig. 1c and d). After the femtosecond laser ablation, a larger number of SN particles were observed on the surface (Fig. 1e and f), while the irregular shaped particles became more regular in shape and smaller in size (∼1 m). Also, the surface of FSPC was fully covered by SN particles due to the elimination of PEKK, which was not observed on the SPC surface where PEKK was still visible (Fig. 1d). Before the femtosecond laser ablation, SN particles exhibited a dense and non-porous surface structure (Fig. 1g and h). However, after the laser treatment, SN particles exhibited a micronized “petal-like” cluster structure composed of smaller “pin-like” nanoparticles leading to a porous nanostructural surface, which resulted from the femtosecond laser ablation of PEKK and SN [21,31]. The formation of the micro/nano structural surface on FSPC was also proved by AFM images (Fig. 2). The “pin-like” morphology was shown in the AFM image of FSPC (Fig. 2c), while the nanoroughness of FSPC (Ra = 154.0 ± 19.9 nm) was significantly higher than those of PEKK (Ra = 28.2 ± 8.7 nm) and SPC (Ra = 81.7 ± 14.3 nm) suggesting the formation of micro/nano surface structures after the femtosecond laser ablation. As shown in Fig. 1k, the compressive strength of SPC (151.0 ± 3.8 MPa) was higher than that of PEKK (134.0 ± 5.1 MPa), due to the incorporation of SN particles. Bioceramic particles including SN particles have been widely used as bioactive fillers to enhance the mechanical properties of PEEK or PEKK implants [14,18,20]. However, in this study, the improvement in compressive strength was not significant after the incorporation of SN particles, which could be due to the inhomogeneous distribution of SN particles in SPC (Fig. 1). Further optimization of SN distribution in PEKK matrices could enhance the mechanical properties of PEKK implants to a greater extent. No obvious difference in compressive strength between SPC and FSPC (149.5 ± 3.2) was found, which was understandable considering that the femtosecond laser treatment could only modify the implant surface. Nevertheless, the femtosecond laser ablation induced micro/nano surface structure on SPC but not reducing the compressive strength.\nFig. 3a shows the FTIR spectra of PEKK, SPC, and FSPC. Characteristic bands of PEKK located at 1650 cm−1 (ascribed to carbonyl stretching vibration), 1152 and 1233 cm−1 (ascribed to C O C stretching vibration of diaryl groups) as well as 1583 cm−1 (ascribed to the carbonyl and aromatic ring C C bond bands) [32] were observed in both spectra of SPC and FSPC. Additionally, a band located at ∼916 cm−1 ascribed to Si-N asymmetrical telescopic vibration and a broad band located at 3440 cm−1 ascribed to N H and O H telescopic vibration were also observed in the FTIR spec-\nH.

The observation of these bands suggested he presence of SN particles in SPC and FSPC. XRD patterns of SPC nd FSPC (Fig. 3b) show characteristic diffraction peaks of PEKK ocated at 2 = 14.0, 18.3, 20.5, 22.7, and 28.6◦ [1] as well as those f SN located at 2 = 13.4, 23.3, 27.0, 33.6, and 36.0◦ [33], which also onfirmed the presence of PEKK and SN in both SPC and FSPC. Morever, the intensity of FTIR bands and XRD patterns of SN appeared o be greater in FSPC than that in SPC, probably due to the entire xposure of SN particles after the femtosecond laser treatment as hown in SEM images (Fig. 1e and f). XPS survey results (Fig. 3c–d) dentify that Si, N, and C were the major constituents of both SPC nd FSPC surfaces. The relatively higher intensity of Si and N peaks in relation to C) in FSPC compared to that in SPC suggested that he femtosecond laser ablation eliminated PEKK and allowed for the xposure of SN particles. The high-resolution XPS spectra (Fig. 3e–f) or N1s show that more N element existed in the form of N-H n FSPC (77.82 %) than that on SPC (38.09 %), indicating a higher mount of -NH2 groups on the surface after the femtosecond laser odification.\n.2. Femtosecond laser ablation enhanced surface hydrophilicity nd protein adsorption\nAs shown in Fig. 4a, the water contact angle of PEKK, SPC, and SPC were 78.5 ± 1.6◦, 62.3 ± 2.2◦ and 35.1 ± 1.3◦, respectively. The ydrophilicity of PEKK was increased after the incorporation of SN llers, which was in agreement with the results in the literature 1,20]. After the femtosecond laser ablation, the hydrophilicity was urther enhanced, probably due to the higher density of exposed N on the surface and micro/nano structural surface (Fig. 1). Addiionally, the increased nanoroughness of FSPC could also contribute o the improvement of hydrophilicity [34]. Fig. 4b shows the proein adsorption of the samples after soaking in BSA-containing PBS\nifferent magnifications; SEM images of surface morphology of SN particles on SPC , SPC and FSPC.\nfor 24 h. The amounts of adsorbed protein on PEKK, SPC, and FSPC were 7.7 ± 2.1, 35.3 ± 5.6, and 59.6 ± 4.2 g/mL, respectively, indicating the enhanced protein adsorption after the SN incorporation and femtosecond laser treatment. SN particles have shown higher protein adsorption capability than PEEK [11], due to their surface chemistry characteristics (e.g., presence of NH2 and Si-OH groups) and topography. Considering the similar surface chemistry of PEEK and PEKK, it is understandable that the incorporation of SN into PEKK could significantly enhance protein adsorption. After the femtosecond laser treatment, a larger amount of SN particles were present on the surface, while the micro/nano structural surface improved the surface area, which could result in the further enhanced protein adsorption."

On the other hand, the concentration of Si ions increased over time in the SPC and FSPC groups, revealing the dissolution of SN particles in physiological fluids [35]. Moreover, the concentration of released Si ions from FSPC was higher than that from SPC, probably due to the larger amount of SN particles on the surface in contact with SBF. Additionally, after the femtosecond laser treatment, the size of SN particles was reduced and the surface was converted to be more porous (Fig. 1), leading to the larger surface area of SN on FSPC and consequently enhancing the dissolution of SN particles. Fig. 4d shows the change in pH values over time. Due to the bioinert characteristic of PEKK, no significant change of pH value (stable at approximate 7.4) was observed in the PEKK group, whereas the pH values of the SPC and FSPC groups increased in the first day of sample immersion and remained stable thereafter. The pH rise was related to the ionization of water (-NH2 + H2O =\n6 H. Wu, T. Liu, Z.

After 4 days of immersion, the pH value of the FSPC group (7.82 ± 0.03) as slightly higher than that of the SPC group (7.76 ± 0.02), probbly due to the larger amount of SN (larger amount of-NH2 group) n FSPC surface than that on SPC.\ns (d) of the samples (*p < 0.05, vs PK; #p < 0.05, FSPC vs SPC).\nFig. 6a shows the quantitative MTT results of rBMSCs after culture on PEKK, SPC and FSPC for different days. The OD values of cells on all samples increased with the extension of culture time, suggesting the proliferation of cells on the samples. At both day 3 and 5, the OD values of the SPC group were significantly higher than the corresponding OD values of the PEKK groups, suggesting that the incorporation of SN particles promoted the cell proliferation. Moreover, the FSPC group exhibited significantly higher OD values than the SPC group, which indicated the promoted cell proliferation after the femtosecond laser treatment. Fig. 6b shows the ALP activity (an indicator of osteoblast differentiation) of rBMSCs on the samples after 7, 10, and 14 days of culture. The ALP activity of the cells cultured on both SPC and FSPC increased over time while no significant change was found in the cells cultured on the PEKK surface. At day 10 and 14, the ALP activity of the FSPC group was significantly higher than that of the SPC group, while PEKK exhibited the lowest ALP activity after culture for 14 days. The results showed that the incorporation of SN particles could enhance the ALP activity of rBMSCs while the femtosecond laser ablation could further promote the ALP activity. Fig. 6c shows the alizarin-red staining images of the cells on the samples. It could be found that the FSPC showed the strongest staining, indicating that the calcium nodule formation on FSPC was higher than those on PEKK and SPC. Fig. 6d displays the quantitative analysis of calcium nodules on the samples, further confirming that FSPC promoted osteogenic differentiation to a greater extent compared with PEKK and SPC.\nFig. 7 shows the expression of osteogenic-related genes (i.e., ALP, OPN, Runx2, and OCN) of rBMSCs after culture on PEKK, SPC and FSPC for different times.

In addition, FSPC could upregulate the expression of he genes to a greater extent than SPC, revealing that the femtosecnd laser ablation on SPC surfaces could enhance the osteogenic ctivity of rBMSCs.\n.5.

A large number of bacterial colonies could be observed in the PEKK group, indicating the negligible bacteriostatic activity of PEKK against both bacteria. Compared to the PEKK group, the amounts of E. coli and S. aureus colonies were reduced in the SPC group. Notably, even compared to the SPC group, both types of colonies were significantly reduced in the FSPC group, indicating that the femtosecond laser ablation induced effective bacteriostatic action. Fig. 8g and h show the relative bacteriostatic ratio of SPC and FSPC towards E. coli and S. aureus. The bacteriostatic ratio of SPC towards E. coli and S. aureus were 56.7 % and 69.2 %, respectively, while FSPC exhibited a significantly higher bacteriostatic ratio towards E. coli (88.5 %) and S. aureus (95.7 %), indicating the enhanced bacteriostatic activity after the femtosecond laser treatment.\n8 H.

Femtosecond laser ablation enhanced osseointegration\nFig. 9 shows 2D and 3D reconstructed images from SRmCT of one defects after the implantation of samples. Both SPC and FSPC ould be observed in the images because SN could act as an effecive CT contrast agent [36], but PEKK could not be observed due o its ray penetrable characteristic [37]. Newly formed bone tisues (NBs) around the implanted materials could be observed in all roups. The amounts of NBs in all groups after 12 weeks of implanation were larger than those after 4 weeks of implantation. At both eek 4 and 12, more NBs were formed around SPC and FSPC than hose around PEKK. At week 12, FSPC induced a significantly higher mount of NBs than SPC. Fig. 10 shows images of the histological ections stained with V&G picro fuchsin after implantation of 4 and 2 weeks. In line with the results of SRmCT images, SPC and FSPC nduced a larger amount of NBs than PEKK, while FSPC could induce ore NBs than SPC after 12 weeks of implantation. Also, more NBs ere found to be closely in contact with the FSPC surface comared to those in the SPC group. However, NBs were only loosely ttached on the PEKK surface. Fig. 11a–b shows the quantitative nalysis of BV/TV and BMD from Micro-CT. At week 12, both BV/TV nd BMD for FSPC were obviously higher than those of SPC and\ndissociated from PEKK (a, d), SPC (b, e) and FSPC (c, f); bacteriostatic rates of the\nPEKK, while those of SPC were higher than PEKK’s. Fig. 11c shows the quantitative analysis results of bone-implant contact (BIC) at week 4 and 12 after the implantation. The BIC of both FSPC and SPC increased over time, while no significant change in BIC was observed in the PEKK group. Moreover, the BIC of both FSPC (82.74 %) and SPC (52.55 %) were higher than that of PEKK (13.12 %) at 12 weeks. Fig. 11d shows the push-out force of the samples at week 4 and 12 after the implantation. The push-out force of both FSPC and SPC increased with the implantation time increasing, but no significant increase in the push-out force was observed in the PEKK group. At week both week 4 and 12, the push-out force of FSPC was the highest while that of PEKK was the lowest. At week 12, the push-out force of FSPC (501.26 ± 41.20 N) was significantly higher than that of SPC (352.93 ± 16.97 N). These in vivo results revealed that the incorporation of SN particles could enhance the osseointegration of PEKK, and the femtosecond laser treatment of SPC could further remarkably promote osseointegration.\n4. Discussion\nImplanted biomaterials with favorable biocompatibility, osteogenic activity, and bacteriostatic property can well integrate\nH. Wu, T. Liu, Z.

PEKK has shown great potential as implanted biomaterials in rthopedic applications due to its superior biocompatibility and echanical performances [2,30]. However, its bioinert characterstic inhibits effective osteogenesis and osseointegration. Many fforts, such as the incorporation of bioactive fillers and surface\nodification, have been dedicated to enhancing the bioreactivity\nf PEKK towards promoting osteogenic activity and osseointeration [1,20]. SN particles have been used as bioactive fillers for\nPEEK or PEKK implants to promote osteogenic and bacteriostatic activities [20,28]. Moreover, SN and PEEK/PEKK can also be modified by various lasers to induce micro/nano structural surfaces (e.g., micro/nano grooves) for enhanced osteogenic activity and osseointegration [27,39]. In this study, we successfully promoted the osteogenic activity, bacteriostatic property, and osseointegration of PEKK implants by the incorporation of bioactive SN and the femtosecond laser induced micro/nano structural surfaces.\nAppropriate micro/nano structural surfaces of implants can benefit osteogenesis and osseointegration, because they can positively\n12 H.

The femtosecond\naser, a potent laser technique, has been widely used to induce eriodic surface structures or to modify surface features for a ariety of biomaterials (e.g., electrospun polymeric fibers, bioeramics, hydrogels) [24,25,40,41]. Femtosecond laser induced icro/nano structures have promoted the osteogenic activities of EEK implants [21,39]. Compared to other laser techniques, the emtosecond laser is characterized by its less thermal damages o the material surface, which has been proven to be an effective echnique to fabricate micro/nano structures on the implant surace without significantly affecting surface chemical properties and omposition [42]. In this study, after the femtosecond laser treatent, the irregular SN microparticles were converted to be smaller N particles exhibiting a “petal-like” structure composed of “pinike” nanoparticles (Fig. 1). The formation of such a micro/nano tructural surface on FSPC could be explained by the femtosecond aser ablation of SN and PEKK. During the laser treatment, both N particles and PEKK underwent instantaneous high-temperature blation and then sublimed/ionized in a short time [24,43]. Due to he greater resistance of SN to the laser, the irregular SN microparicles (∼3 m) on SPC were not completely ablated but shaped into niformly microparticles with a reduced size (∼1 m). As a comarison, most PEKK on the surface was ablated. The surface of FSPC as completely covered by SN particles (Fig. 1), and a “petal-like” icro structure composed of “pin-like” nanoparticles was formed. imilar micro/nano structures were also found in femtosecond laser blated surfaces of titanium alloys, which greatly facilitated cell dhesion [26,44]. In addition to modifying the surface morphology, he femtosecond laser ablation also changed the surface chemical tructure and compositions. As mentioned above, PEKK was mostly\nush-out force (d) of the samples at 4 and 12 weeks after implantation (*p < 0.05, vs\nablated by the laser while SN particles remained the main component of surface, which was confirmed by the FTIR, XRD, and XPS results (Fig. 3) that revealed the surface properties of FSPC resembling those of SN particles. For example, -NH2 and -OH groups appeared on the surfaces of both SPC and FSPC due to the incorporation of SN as indicated in the FTIR and XPS spectra (Fig. 3), which are key regulators of cell activities in bone formation [5]. Moreover, FSPC exhibited a greater intensity of -NH2 and -OH groups than SPC, due to the full exposure of SN particles on the surface after the femtosecond laser ablation. The surface concentration of N-H on FSPC (77.82 %) was higher than that on SPC (38.09 %), also suggesting the increased amount of SN on the FSPC surface.\nThe presence of the micro/nano structural surface after the femtosecond laser treatment also increased the surface nanoroughness (Fig. 2). The surface roughness of biomaterials can affect cellular responses, especially the initial interactions between cells and substrates, such as cell adhesion and spreading [45,46]. Kue et al. [47] reported that lower roughness of SN discs appeared more favorable for maintaining the viability and function of human osteoblast-like MG63 cells. On the other hand, Deligianni et al. [46] investigated the influence of roughness of another bioceramic (hydroxyapatite) on the behavior of human bone marrow cells. They revealed that the cell adhesion, proliferation, and detachment strength were enhanced when the surface nanoroughness was increased, probably due to the enhanced adsorption of serum proteins. Our results showed that FSPC with higher surface roughness facilitated cell adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in comparison to PEKK and SPC with lower nanoroughness (Fig. 5–7). However, cellular responses are also related to surface topography, chemistry, and surface charge. The effects of surface roughness on cellular behaviors may be contradictory when different materials\nd Mat\na o a f a l a m n s P o p a m o i h i m t -\ns i r s a s s b o b t s i b c s l m m t t s w o t i o\nc a c a A i a w w h [ i a r b\nH. Wu, T. Liu, Z. Xu et al. / Applie\nre compared. For example, the contribution of the higher density f SN particles on the FSPC surface to cellular responses should lso be considered, given the favorable surface chemistry of SN or osteogenic activities [5,28]. Also, FSPC exhibited greater protein dsorption (Fig. 4), which is also generally advantageous for celluar responses [48]. Protein adsorption on the biomaterial surface is n initial step to modulate the interactions between the cells and aterials [48]. PEKK exhibits a bioinert surface which is generally ot favorable for protein adsorption and consequent cell adheion [1]. SN particles have shown greater protein adsorption than EEK [11], probably due to their surface chemistry (e.g., presence f -NH2 and -OH groups). Understandably, FSPC exhibited greater rotein adsorption than SPC, considering their larger total surface rea of SN on the surface (Fig. 1). Greater hydrophilicity of the bioaterials usually also facilitates cell adhesion, proliferation, and steogenic differentiation [49]. FSPC exhibited greater hydrophilicty than SPC (Fig. 4) because they had a higher concentration of ydrophilic SN particles. Therefore, the promoted cellular behavors of FSPC should be ascribed to the femtosecond laser induced icro/nano structures enhancing nanoroughness, protein adsorpion, hydrophilicity, and the concentration of functional -NH2 and OH groups.\nImplantation-associated infection remains a major challenge for uccessful clinical applications of implants. Biomaterials that can nhibit bacterial adhesion and growth are preferred, as they can educe the risk of infection and maintain the long-term in vivo tability of implants [50]. Bacterial adhesion onto biomaterials is\ncomplex process, which is related to a variety of factors, e.g., urface roughness, hydrophilicity, and surface chemistry [51]. The uperior bacteriostatic activity of SN to Ti and PEEK implants has een verified in previous studies [9,52]. The bacteriostatic activity f SN is believed to result from the chemical interactions between acteria and the biological environment around SN particles, as eluion of ammonia can take place when SN particles are in aqueous olutions, which can trigger a cascade of reactions leading to the nhibition of bacterial growth [28]. Here FSPC exhibited the greatest acteriostatic activity (Fig. 8), probably due to their highest conentration of SN on the surface. Additionally, -NH2 groups on SN urfaces can form NH4+ in an aqueous environment, and weak alkaine microenvironment was consequently created (Fig. 4d). This\nicroenvironment might change the permeability of the bacterial embrane, block the transport of nutrients, and thus inhibit bacerial adhesion on SN surfaces [53]. After the femtosecond laser reatment, the whole surface of FSPC was covered by micro/nano tructural SN particles, leading to the larger active surface area, hich further enhanced the bacteriostatic activity. However, in rder to understand the anti-infection capacity of FSPC in vivo, paricularly in infected bone defects, further studies (e.g., evaluation n infected animal models), are required, which will be focused in ur future studies.\nEffective cell adhesion is an essential event for the subsequent ell proliferation and differentiation [54]. The femtosecond laser blation induced micro/nano structural surfaces on FSPC, which ould provide more binding sites for cell adhesion as the interction with the cellular filopodia at nano-scale might occur [55]. dditionally, higher hydrophilicity and roughness can also faciltate cell adhesion [45], which could explain the enhanced cell dhesion on SPC and FSPC compared to PEKK. The cell proliferation as also enhanced after the femtosecond laser treatment (Fig. 6), hich was likely due to the incorporation of SN particles increasing ydrophilicity and inducing the release of biologically active Si ions 10,20]. Osteogenic differentiation of the cells was enhanced by the nclusion of SN particles into PEKK as indicated by the improved ALP ctivity (Fig. 6b), alizarin-red staining (Fig. 6c–d) and osteogenic elated gene expression (Fig. 7). The enhanced osteogenesis could e ascribed to the release of active Si ions from SN particles, which\nerials Today 18 (2020) 100523 13\nwas in good agreement with the results in the literature [5,20,28]. After the surface modification by femtosecond laser, the proliferation and osteogenic activities of the cells was further improved, likely due to the synergistic effects of both micro/nano structural surface and released Si ions. Release of biologically active ions (e.g., Si and Ca ions) from biomaterials has been considered as a key regulatory factor to cellular behaviors and functions [56]. SN can dissolve in physiological fluids over time and release Si ions [5,35]. SN particles could act as a regulator of mesenchymal progenitor cell activity towards bone formation [5], owing to their unique surface chemistry and topography characteristics. Fu et al. [10] developed biodegradable SN based bioceramics by sintering SN with SrO, MgO, and SiO2 additives that could release biologically active ions. The dissolution products of these bioceramics enhanced proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts. Our results showed that FSPC could upregulate the expression of osteogenic genes to a greater extent than SPC, which could be ascribed to the favorable surface morphology and chemistry characteristics (e.g., enhanced release of Si ions) after the femtosecond laser treatment. To further confirm the improved osteogenic activity, it is necessary to understand the effects of the micro/nano surface structures on relevant protein expression, which will be carried out in our future studies. Based on the promising in vitro cellular performance of FSPC, in vivo studies were performed to evaluate the bone repair and osseointegration of samples in a rabbit femur cavity defect. According to the images from SRmCT and histological sections (Fig. 9 and 10), SPC and FSPC significantly promoted new bone formation in comparison to PEKK. Previous results have shown that SN implants exhibited enhanced in vivo osteoinductive properties in comparison to PEEK and Ti [9], which were in line with the findings in our in vivo study. Moreover, specific micro/nano surface structures can also promote osteogenesis and osseointegration of implanted biomaterials [1]. Given the favorable surface topography induced by the femtosecond laser and intrinsic surface chemistry of SN, it is thus understandable that FSPC induced more new bone formation in comparison to SPC and PEKK (Fig. 9 and 10). Particularly, after implantation for 12 weeks, almost no gap between formed bone tissues and FSPC could be observed, while the gaps were still visible in both SPC and PEKK groups (Fig. 10), which suggested the excellent osseointegration of FSPC. BV/TV and BMD were usually used to evaluate the new bone regeneration [57]. BIC, defined as the percentage of implant surface covered by NBs, is one of the critical indicators to quantify the degree of osseointegration [58]. After implantation for 4 and 12 weeks, the BV/TV, BMD and BIC of FSPC were higher than those of SPC and PEKK, which also proved the promoted osseointegration of FSPC. The push-out force reflects the bonding strength between the implants and NBs [59]. At both tested time points, FSPC showed the highest push-out force, revealing their superior osseointegration to SPC and PEKK. As discussed above, cell adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of the implants were enhanced after the femtosecond laser ablation. All these positive results should greatly contribute to the promoted in vivo osteogenesis and osseointegration occurring on FSPC.\nIn this study, we aimed to prove the femtosecond laser induced micro/nano structural surface could enhance the osseointegration and osteogenesis of the composite SN/PEKK implants. This hypothesis has been clearly proved by the in vitro and in vivo results. The improvement in cell adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation after the femtosecond laser modification was induced by the synergistic effects of both micro/nano structural surface (improved roughness, hydrophilicity, protein adsorption and presence of functional groups of -NH2 and -OH) and the release of bioactive Si ions. The synergistic effects could stimulate cell behaviors towards successful bone regeneration through specific signal pathways such as 5 and 1 integrins, Wnt/ -catenin, ILKERK1/2 and ILKP38 pathways [60–62]. However, in order to develop\n1 ed Ma\na p P o s\n5\nc c t S n a f c i r f m l u b l t s t a m F o i\nA\ng\nt\nD\nR\n- F\nD\nc i\nA\nF n\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n4 H. Wu, T. Liu, Z.

This comparison will be carried out in our further tudy.\n. Conclusion\nBioactive composites composed of SN and PEKK was fabriated by blending and compression molding. The surface of the omposites was modified by the femtosecond laser, which led o the formation of unique micro/nano structural surafces, i.e., N microscale “petal-like” clusters composed of “pin-like” SN anoparticles. The surface roughness, hydrophilicity, and protein dsorption of the composites were significantly improved after the emtosecond laser ablation. Additionally, FSPC released a higher oncentration of Si ions than unmodified SPC. FSPC also exhibted stronger bacteriostatic activity than SPC and PEKK, which esulted from synergistic effects of micro/nano surface structure, unctional groups, and hydrophilicity. Furthermore, the induced\nicro/nano structural surface of FSPC facilitated the adhesion, proiferation, and osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs compared to nmodified SPC and PEKK. The in vivo study performed in a rabit femur cavity defect model showed that FSPC exhibited the argest bone-implant contact and highest push-out force compared o SPC and PEKK, suggesting the significantly promoted osteogeneis and osseointegration after the surface modification. In summary, he femtosecond laser technique has shown its capability to crete unique micro/nano structural surfaces on implants to actively odulate cellular responses and osseointegration. The fabricated SPC exhibited excellent biocompatibility, bacteriostatic activity, steogenic activity, and osseointegration, showing great potential n orthopedic applications.\nuthor contributions section\nHan Wu: Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Investiation, Writing - Original Draft, Writing - Review & Editing.\nTao Liu: Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Investigaion, Writing - Original Draft, Writing - Review & Editing.\nZhiyan Xu: Validation, Investigation.

    "abstractText" : "Poor cell adhesion and osteogenic activity impede the bone regeneration and osseointegration effects of polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) implants. Surface modification and incorporation of bioactive fillers are effective strategies to promote the cellular responses of PEKK implants and their integration with bone tissues. In this study, silicon nitride (SN) microparticles were blended with PEKK to develop bioactive composite implants (SPC). Femtosecond laser was then used to modify SPC surfaces inducing favorable micro/nano structural surface (FSPC). After the laser ablation, irregularly shaped SN microparticles were converted to “petal-like” clusters composed of “pin-like” SN nanoparticles, while the entire surface was covered by SN particles due to the removal of PEKK. The roughness, hydrophilicity, content of surface chemical groups (e.g., -NH2), and protein adsorption capability of FSPC were significantly enhanced compared to SPC and PEKK. Also, the release of biologically active Si ions was increased after the femtosecond laser treatment, inducing a positive microenvironment favorable for cellular activities. Moreover, FSPC exhibited a greater bacteriostatic activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) than SPC. The presence of micro/nano structure also remarkably promoted adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of rat bone mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs). In vivo evaluation of the composites in a rabbit femur defect model verified that FSPC could enhance osteogenesis and osseointegration to a greater extent than SPC, evidenced with greater bone-implant contacts and push-out force. These results indicate that the femtosecond laser induced micro/nano structural surface on SN/PEKK implants can significantly promote osseointegration and bone repair. The femtosecond laser exhibits great potential in surface modifying bioceramic/polymer composites. The fabricated FSPC have shown great potential as bone implants in orthopedic applications considering their excellent biocompatibility, bacteriostatic property, osteogenic activity, and osseointegration. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
