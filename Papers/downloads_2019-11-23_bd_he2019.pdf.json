      "text" : "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is partly characterized as epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related airflow limitation. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play crucial roles in the crosstalk between cells, affecting many diseases including COPD. Up to now, the roles of EVs in COPD are still debated. As we found in this investigation, COPD patients have higher miR-21 level in total serum EVs. EMT occurs in lungs of COPD mice. Furthermore, bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) could generate EVs with less miR-21 when treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE), impacting less on the M2-directed macrophage polarization than the control-EVs (PBS-treated) according to EVs miR-21 level. Furthermore, the EMT processes in BEAS-2B cells were enhanced with the M2 macrophages proportion when co-cultured. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CSE-treated BEAS-2B cells could alleviate M2 macrophages polarization by modulated EVs, and eventually relieve the EMT process of BEAS-2B cells themselves under COPD pathogenesis, revealing a novel compensatory role of them in COPD. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These inflammatory reactions might lead to many abnormal structural changes in COPD, such as epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-based narrowing of small airways (also named small airway\nThis project was funded by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 81770042, 81500033).\n⁎Corresponding authors.

Furthermore, many studies also reported that EMT is associated with small airway remodeling.8,9 Generally speaking, many cytokines could contribute to the development of EMT, such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), fibroblast growth factor 2, connective tissue growth factor and insulin-like growth factor 2.10 Among those EMT-related cytokines, TGF-β is also considered a typical product of M2 macrophages, which are\nles ameliorate epithelial–mesenchymal transition in COPD pathogenesis by .nano.2019.03.010\ntherefore in turn considered to be directly connected to the EMT process.11,12\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes (usually 30 nm150 nm in diameter,) and microvesicles (usually 200 nm-1000 nm in diameter), composed of a phospholipid bilayer, can be secreted by many cells, including epithelial cells, dendritic cells, mast cells macrophages, etc.13 EVs have been recently recognized as a novel cell-to-cell communication method for nucleic acids, proteins encapsulation and delivery functions.14 In this manner, the EVsreceiving cells could thereforemake different responses according to the EVs' content.15,16 As one of the most common cargo of EVs, microRNAs could participate in many inflammatory lung diseases' pathogenesis17; thus, it is reasonable to make a hypothesis that EVs could influence the occurrence of those inflammatory lung diseases through the contained microRNAs.\nMiR-21 is a promising research element for its multi-functional roles in many diseases, especially in tumor related diseases.18,19 However, many researchers reported that miR-21 could also be related to various inflammatory diseases,20–22 including many pulmonary inflammatory diseases23–25 by targeting specific pathways, thereby regulating the expression of related key signals. Notably, one of the most important ways miR-21 functions, in both tumor and non-tumor diseases, is by affecting the EMT process.26 This concept has been confirmed bymany other researchers. Yang et al found that miR-21 promotes high glucose-induced human peritoneal mesothelial cells EMT by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).27 Moreover, Wu et al reported that, in breast cancer, miR-21 could also target PTEN/AKT pathway, inducing EMT.28 In our previous studies, miR-21 was found to be higher in the serumof healthy smokers in comparisonwithCOPD patients,29 an observation further confirmed by our following in vivo studies. Furthermore, it was found that the level of miR-21 in the lungs is positively correlated to the severity of COPD.30 Additionally, we reported that the proportion of M2 macrophages was enhanced in both alveolar and peripheral blood in a COPD mouse model and this might also be an indicator of the COPD severity.31,32\nIn this investigation, a novel mechanism of how bronchial epithelial cells compensate for the EMT process under cigarette smoke extract (CSE) stress by modifying their EVs' content is presented for the first time."

Instead, 8% and 10% CSE showed a significant increase in the apoptotic cells percentage of BEAS-2B cells (Figure 4, G). Furthermore, in comparison to 0%CSE group, the 1%, 3% and 5% CSE reduced the EVs miR-21 level of BEAS-2B cells; however, this was not the case for the 8% and 10% CSE (Figure 4, H).\nEVs as carriers of miR-21 from BEAS-2B cells to macrophages\nEVs were dyed with PKH67 (Sigma, USA) and incubated with THP-1 derived macrophages for 6 h respectively.

      "heading" : "Discussion",
      "text" : "The present study consolidated the pathogenic role of miR-21 in COPD in promoting EMT in bronchial epithelial cells via macrophage polarization. More importantly, as the level of total serum EVs miR-21 in COPD patients increases, bronchial epithelial cells were shown to reduce the level of their EVs miR-21 to compensate for the pathogenic effects of increased EVs miR-21 from other sources. In this manuscript, for the first time, a novel self-compensatory role of EVs in COPD pathogenesis is presented.\nAs the dominant element in COPD pathogenesis, CS contains numerous toxicmaterials and noxious particles which could directly cause disorders in lung, especially the microRNA expression profiles.43,44 According to Momi and colleagues, this could result from some epigenetic disruption, such as DNA methylation and genetic alterations.45 In this study, similarly, we confirmed an\nincreased level of serum EVs miR-21 in COPD patients. The serum EVs could be a total of all the other cells derived EVs, macroscopically reflecting the changes of their contents. This result indicates that CSE exposure might influence not only the cellular or lung tissue miR-21 level,29,30,46 but also the serum EVs. However, when we focused on a single cell type, the miR-21 level was decreased in BEAS-2B EVs in 5% CSE exposure, indicating the BEAS-2B cellswereworking against the overall trendswhen treated with CSE. As reported by many researchers, EVs could play multifunctional roles in the internalmicroenvironment. For instance, those tumor cells derived EVs always tend to work in a pathogenic way. Shan and colleagues found that EVs from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), under hypoxic conditions, were overloaded with matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), leading to enhanced migration and invasiveness and inducing microenvironment changes to promote NPC aggressiveness.47 In a similar manner, the hypoxic tumor-derived EVs contained more miR-301a,\npromoting pancreatic cancer metastasis by influencing tumor associated macrophages polarization.15 On the other hand, those stem cells derived EVs could act in a therapeutic way. Adiposederived stem cells could control obesity-associated inflammation andmetabolic disorders by EVswithmodifiedmicroRNAprofile.16 Besides, mesenchymal stromal cell EVs were found to be able to alleviate the hyperoxia induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia by blunting related inflammation and immune response, still, resulting from the modified EVs contents.48 All these results above indicate that it is the contents of the EVs thatmake themmulti-functional and this concept is in line with our results. Although we observed an increased level of EVs miR-21 in 8% or 10% CSE, this is not a normal way of EVs secretion and would lead to an unauthentic result. 8% or 10% CSE could cause an obvious enhancement of the apoptotic cell percentage, whichmight give rise to an uncontrollable release of other extracellular vesicles from the dead cell and therefore influence the observing of the actual EVs contents.\nNotably, M2 macrophages were recently considered to be the primary active phenotype in COPD.49 In this study, we confirmed that macrophages could uptake BEAS-2B EVs and be polarized into an M2 phenotype by EVs miR-21 in COPD pathogenesis. Similar results were also reported by other researchers15,16 for other diseases. According to them, those EVs miR-21 might take effect through targeting PTEN/PI3Kgamma pathway or the phosphorylation process of STAT3. As was found by us that the proportion of M2 macrophages was negatively correlated with the lung function of mouse COPD models, it is reasonable to speculate that EVs from the CSE-treated BEAS-2B cells could play a compensatory role by reducing their EVs miR-21 which could therefore decrease the M2 macrophage proportion.\nAn obvious EMT process was observed in the lungs of mouse COPD models in the present study, in line with many previous studies.50–52 Furthermore, when the 0% CSE-EVs- and 5% CSEEVs- polarized macrophages were co-cultured with other BEAS-2B cells respectively, the former resulted in severer EMT in BEAS-2B cells becau EMT process partly through the TLR4/IL-10 pathway.53 Moreover, Shen and colleagues found that M2macrophages could promote EMT process by TGF-β1 in renal fibrosis54 which is similar to what we found previously - an increased TGF-β in alveolar M2 macrophages in COPD31. These results indicating, in the present study, that those EVs-polarizedM2macrophages could promote EMT in BEAS-2B cells by TGF-β.\nSeveral recent studies showed that EVs play crucial roles in COPD. Benedikter and colleagues found that EVs from CSEtreated bronchial epithelial cells could affect the inflammation process of both smokers and ex-smokers.36 Moreover, Yu Fujita and colleagues reported that EVs could also promote the EMT process in lungs of COPD patients by affecting the autophage process.37 Furthermore, Kim and colleagues also demonstrated the therapeutic role of EVs from adipose stem cells in the development of emphysema.55 In our investigation, we have demonstrated that the contents of EVs could be modified according to the exposure of COPD pathogeneses, therefore compensating for the following pathological changes.\nHowever, there are some limitations in the present study that merit mentioning. Firstly, aswaswidely reported, EVs containmany agents other than the targets of interest investigated in this study. This should be considered in future investigations by performing a\ncomplementary gene sequencing or proteomics of the EVs. Moreover, although the EVs TEM images in the present study could provide a clear structure of the EVs isolated, images with multiple EVs would be advantageous, as it could provide more detailed information of the sample. Additionally, regarding the coculture of M2 macrophages and BEAS-2B cells, we set two groups, which are both treated with EVs, for the reason that, in real world, macrophages are supposed to be always under the influences of EVs. However, to be more rigorous, an extra PBS-treated macrophage group could be better to measure the specific effects of M2 macrophages. Furthermore, one more western blot of TGF-β in the co-culturedBEAS-2B cells couldmake the results more confidential as it could give more information about where the TGF-β came from, leading the EMT process of BEAS-2B cells.\nIn summary, BEAS-2B cells were shown to indirectly modulate the EMT process in the COPD pathogenesis by alleviating the polarization of M2 macrophages via reducing their EVs miR-21 level, revealing a novel compensatory role of EVs in COPD."

    "abstractText" : "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is partly characterized as epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related airflow limitation. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play crucial roles in the crosstalk between cells, affecting many diseases including COPD. Up to now, the roles of EVs in COPD are still debated. As we found in this investigation, COPD patients have higher miR-21 level in total serum EVs. EMT occurs in lungs of COPD mice. Furthermore, bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) could generate EVs with less miR-21 when treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE), impacting less on the M2-directed macrophage polarization than the control-EVs (PBS-treated) according to EVs miR-21 level. Furthermore, the EMT processes in BEAS-2B cells were enhanced with the M2 macrophages proportion when co-cultured. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CSE-treated BEAS-2B cells could alleviate M2 macrophages polarization by modulated EVs, and eventually relieve the EMT process of BEAS-2B cells themselves under COPD pathogenesis, revealing a novel compensatory role of them in COPD. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
