In this study, a magnetic nano-composite adsorbent, i.e. reduced graphene–iron oxide (rGO–Fe3O4) was synthesized and used for removal of phenazopyridine residues from wastewater samples. Experimental parameters influencing adsorption process were optimized, and results showed a sorption capacity of 14.064 mg g -1 at pH= 6.0 for phenazopyridine. Under the best experimental condition, rGO–Fe3O4 nanocomposite showed an efficiency of 91.4% for removal of phenazopyridine in aqueous solution. Adsorption of phenazopyridine on flat and parallel oxygen and iron–terminated rGO–Fe3O4 surfaces was studied by density functional theory calculations. It was found that, in case of both oxygen and iron–terminated rGO–Fe3O4 surfaces, phenazopyridine prefers to interact with aromatic ring and amino flat to oxygen–terminated rGO–Fe3O4 surface, as opposed to iron–terminated sites due to enhanced charge migration at the interface. Negative adsorption energy revealed that formation of phenazopyridine@ rGO–Fe3O4 is an exothermic process, confirming stability of these species.\nKeywords: Magnetite/graphene oxide nanocomposite, Phenazopyridine removal, Adsorption, Kinetic investigation, DFT investigation\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of"

      "text" : "Release of pollutants into water poses many risks to human health, and is also harmful to aquatic life [1]. On the other hand, presence of drug residues in wastewater or soil can be harmful to plants and human [2, 3], creating important challenges for application of drugs [4]. Sources of water pollution are wastewaters produced from hospitals, agriculture as well as industrial and domestic activities [5]. Most of medicines coming into wastewater are absorbed by activated sludge processes in treatment systems, transferring them from liquid to solid phases [6, 7]. As a remedy, the application of advanced treatment processes has a good efficiency in removing such micro contaminants [8, 9]. Due to the importance of water recycling, global focus on wastewater removal has increased in recent years [10-15]. Phenazopyridine is an azo-derivative dye with pharmaceutical applications excreted through urine [16-18]. Unwanted administration of phenazopyridine, e.g. through polluted water samples can lead to emergence of symptoms such as headache and upset stomach. This compound can also cause changes in skin or eye pigments making them turn into a noticeable yellowish color. Therefore, it is very important to remove phenazopyridine residues from wastewater. Nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, polymer nanowires, metal oxide nanoparticles, etc. are unique due to their properties like considerably high surface area [19-27]. These materials have been used for removal of pollutants [28-32], fabrication of sensors for biological and pharmaceutical materials [33-40], energy storage systems [41], super-capacitors [42], batteries [43] and drug delivery [44]. Different types of nanomaterials such as metalorganic framework [45], iron nanoparticle [46] and nano-clay composite [47] have been suggested as adsorbents for removal of drugs from water samples. Compared to reported adsorbents, rGO–Fe3O4 nanocomposite has shown more advantages such as enjoying a high surface area contributing to more recovery percentage in pollutant removal. Due to good\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\nregeneration of rGO–Fe3O4 nanocomposite, this adsorbent is very cost-effective for industrial applications. With regard to this fact, the present study was conducted aimed at synthesis and application of rGO–Fe3O4 nanocomposite, as a high -performance adsorbent for removal of phenazopyridine from water samples. Results of experiments indicated that, developed adsorbent showed considerable ability for removal of phenazopyridine in water samples. Additionally, a Density Functional Theory (DFT) study was performed to comprehend nature of adsorption sites, as well as structure and interaction energy between phenazopyridine residues and rGO–Fe3O4."
