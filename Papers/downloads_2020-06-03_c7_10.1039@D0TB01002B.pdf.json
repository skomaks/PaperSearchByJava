Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation shows the nano/submicro-fibrous morphology and well-interconnected porous structure of the BC/CA grafts. It is found that the BC/CA graft with a suitable BC content demonstrates lower potential of thrombus formation and enhanced endothelialization as compared to the BC and CA counterparts. Western blotting and RT-qPCR results suggest that the BC/CA-2 graft promotes endothelialization by improving expressions of genes vWF-1 and CD31 and protein CD31. The in vivo tests demonstrate much lower inflammatory response to the BC/CA graft. These results suggest that the BC/CA graft shows a great potential as an artificial graft for rapid formation of an endothelial cell monolayer.\nvascular graft, nanofiber, bacterial cellulose, endothelialization"

      "heading" : "Introduction",
      "text" : "Currently, autologous grafts (autografts) are still the gold standard for vascular replacement. However, the use of autografts is limited by the shortage of donors and secondary site injury.1, 2 Therefore, artificial grafts have become the focus of research in the field of vascular replacement. Although large vascular grafts are successfully used in the clinic, smalldiameter vascular grafts (< 6 mm) remain a huge challenge due to intimal hyperplasia and thrombosis.1, 3-6 Therefore, much effort has been made to mitigate these issues, including surface modification and controlled drug release approaches.79 Despite these achievements, the performance of the\nreported small-diameter vascular grafts is still unsatisfactory. Accordingly, new strategies are highly demanded to develop novel small-diameter grafts with rapid endothelialization and therefore non-thrombotic.10 Recently, mimicking the morphological structures of native tissues becomes a popular strategy. Native blood vessels are composed of three layered structures, i.e., tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica adventitia.11, 12 Of these three layers, replicating the structure of tunica intima is the focus of research on vascular grafts, which contains a monolayer of endothelial cells attached to their basement membrane, and is critical to anti-thrombosis.3, 6 The basement membrane in tunica intima is composed of a topographically rich threedimensional (3D) non-woven porous fibrous network in which the fibers are on the nano (1 - 100 nm) and submicron (100 - 1000 nm) size scale. The intrinsic topography of the basement membrane plays a critical role in adjusting the adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation of the overlying endothelial cells.13 Although a great deal of research has been emphasized on the fabrication of nano/micro-fibrous 14, 15 and nano/submicro-fibrous 16, 17 scaffolds, nano/submicro-fibrous vascular grafts have not yet been reported. Furthermore, many studies focused on the fabrication of structurally biomimetic vascular grafts including bi-layered structures 10, 18 and tri-layered grafts.11 The replication of the nano/submicrofibrous structure of the tunica intima has not been reported, partially because it is difficult to integrate nanofibers and submicrofibers within a hollow tube by available techniques.\nPage 1 of 15 Journal of Materials Chemistry B\nJo ur\nna lo\nfM at\ner ia\nls C\nhe m\nis tr\ny B\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\n0 3\nJu ne\n2 02\n0.

The main objectives of this work are thus to prepare the nano/submicro-fibrous vascular grafts with varying contents of BC, to evaluate their morphologies, chemical and mechanical properties, in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility, the propensity of the material for endothelialization, and to understand how endothelial cells respond to the nano-submicro-fibrous matrix."

      "text" : "The materials for BC biosynthesis including yeast extract, tryptone, disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4), and acetic acid were provided by Beijing Innochem Science & Technology Co., Ltd., China. All other materials and reagents were purchased from Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China, unless otherwise indicated and used as received without any further purification. The bacterial strain, Komagataeibacter xylinus X-2, was received from Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, China.\nPreparation of electrospun CA submicrofibrous graft\nCellulose acetate (CA, MW = 4.0 × 104) was dissolved into a mixture of acetone/acetic acid (1 / 1 by volume) under constant stirring, resulting in a CA solution with a concentration of 15 wt%. The CA solution was poured into a 10 mL plastic syringe and fed by a pump through a stainless steel needle. The electrospinning was performed at a voltage of 10 kV, a solution flow rate of 5 mL h-1, and a throw distance (between collector and needle) of 15 cm (at approximately 25 - 30 °C and 40% relative humidity. The fibers were directly collected on a cylinder rotating at 100 rpm (Fig. 1A) with a diameter corresponding to that of the envisaged graft. The\nobtained submicrofibrous CA graft was vacuum dried at 70 °C for 24 h and finally sterilized at 115 °C for 30 min.\nPreparation of nano/submicro-fibrous BC/CA grafts\nThe bacterial strain, Komagataeibacter xylinus X-2 was used for the production of BC, and the culture medium (pH = 4.5) for the fermentation consisted of 2.5% (w/v) glucose, 0.75% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) tryptone, and 1% (w/v) Na2HPO4. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, two silicon tubes with different diameters were fixed in the assembly, and the space between them was filled with the culture medium (150 - 200 R # inoculated with the bacteria. There was sufficient oxygen due to the existence of the vent hole and the silicon tubes. A BC ring (BC substrate) with a thickness of about 2 mm could be obtained after culture for 1 - 2 days within the space, which was used as the substrate for the preparation of BC/CA grafts via the step-by-step in situ biosynthesis as reported in our previous studies.26 Typically, a tubular CA scaffold 30 mm long was cut and placed on the top of the BC substrate. The culture medium (50 R # was sprayed to the space between silicon tubes, thus filling the pores of the CA scaffold. After in situ growth of BC within the CA scaffold for 1 h, a second cycle of feeding and growth continued. The process was completed after the 4th cycle, yielding the BC/CA-1 hydrogel. Similarly, BC/CA-2, BC/CA-3, and BC/CA-4 hydrogels were produced, corresponding to 6, 8, and 10 cycles, respectively. The same procedure was employed to produce a bare BC graft for control. Afterward, the BC/CA hydrogels were taken out and purified using the same procedures reported in our previous work,27 leading to BC/CA grafts with varying diameters (Fig. 1C). The diameter and thickness of the BC/CA grafts were determined by the diameter of the two silicon tubes and the space between them. The morphological structure of the BC/CA grafts is illustrated in Fig. 1D. BC and BC/CA grafts were immersed in tertiary butanol for 10 h, renewed every 2 h, followed by washing with deionized water at least three times, for further characterization. The grafts were stored in a freezer at -20 °C for 24 h and finally lyophilized at -50 °C for 36 h to obtain the BC and BC/CA aerogels.\nPage 2 of 15Journal of Materials Chemistry B\nJo ur\nna lo\nfM at\ner ia\nls C\nhe m\nis tr\ny B\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\n0 3\nJu ne\n2 02\n0.

The BC, CA, and BC/CA samples were cut into circular specimens with a diameter of 15 mm and placed into 24-well culture plates. 100 R of PRP was carefully deposited on each specimen followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS solution, these treated specimens were fixed using 0.25% glutaraldehyde solution for 24 h and then dehydrated with a series of ethanol solutions (30, 50, 75, 90, 100%) for 15 min each. Finally, the dehydrated specimens were air-dried and sputter-coated for SEM observation. The platelet adhesion on BC, CA, and BC/CA grafts was also quantified by a lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. In brief, fresh PRP (300 R # was dropped on BC, CA, and BC/CA grafts, respectively, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The PRP suspension was removed from samples, followed by washing with PBS for three times. The lysis solution (150 R # was then dropped on the grafts and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to induce lysis of the adhered platelets and LDH release. The lysate (120 R # was collected and mixed with the substrate solution (80 R #! Finally, the mixtures were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatants were collected and measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader (2000, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, USA)."

Each circular sample with a diameter of 10 mm was put into a tube containing 10 mL of 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride solution and conditioned at 37 °C for 30 min. Afterward, 0.2 mL of the diluted blood was added followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Finally, the solutions were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was measured at 540 nm using the aforementioned microplate reader to determine the optical density (OD). The hemolysis rate was calculated using Equation (1).29 R= (A C1)/(C2 C1) × 100% (1) where R was the hemolysis ratio (%), A was the absorbance (%), C1 and C2 were the absorbance of the negative and positive controls (%), respectively.\nIn vitro biocompatibility\nThe cell proliferation was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital). The HUVEC cells were cultured in endothelial cell medium (ENCM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% ECGS in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The culture medium was renewed every other day. The circular grafts with a thickness of 1 mm and a diameter of 14 mm were sterilized at 121 °C for 30 min (LDZX-30KBS, Shenan, Shanghai, China).\nPrior to cell seeding, grafts were immersed in medium with 10% FBS at 37 °C for at least 3 h. Afterward, cells were seeded on the grafts with a density of 1 × 104 per well and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 1, 4, and 7 days. After incubation, 200 R of mixed medium containing CCK-8 and ENCM (VCCK-8 : VENCM = 1 : 10) was added to each well followed by incubation in darkness at 37 °C for 3 h. The culture medium (100 R # was transferred to 96-well plates and the absorbance was read at 450 nm using microplate reader (iMark, Bio Rad, California, USA). After culture under the aforementioned conditions, the grafts were rinsed with PBS (phosphate buffered saline) twice followed by staining with live staining reagent (Fluorescein diacetate). After further incubation for 30 min, the stained cultures were viewed using a fluorescence microscope (TS2, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The cell morphology was observed by SEM. After incubation for 4 and 7 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde solution at 4 °C for 12 h, and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, and 100%).

Thereafter, the membrane was washed with TBST (0.01% Tween-20 in TBS) for three times and 5 min each time, which was then incubated with goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse second antibodies (Jackson, Hartford, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. The ECL plus Western blotting substrate was used to visualize the protein bands.

Furthermore, the ratio of BC nanofibers to CA submicrofibers can be adjusted. The morphologies of nano/submicro-fibrous grafts were observed by SEM (Fig. 2A) and average fiber diameter was determined (Fig. S1, ESI). BC nanofibers with a diameter of about 46 - 50 nm and CA submicrofibers with a diameter of 0.64 - 0.92 R 3 are combined in an interpenetrated network. Furthermore, BC nanofibers are present throughout the entire BC/CA grafts, which can be confirmed in Fig. S2 (ESI). As shown in Fig. 2A, the number of BC nanofibers increases with the biosynthesis duration (Table S1, ESI).

The TGA curves reveal a similar three-stage trend a slight weight loss below 100 °C due to water evaporation,37 a drastic weight loss at 250 - 400 °C due to degradation of main cellulose skeleton,38 and a stable stage at higher temperatures. Moreover, the TGA result indicates a slight positive effect of BC on the stability of the BC/CA materials. Wettability is an important factor with great influence on cell attachment.39, 40 The water contact angles of BC, CA, and BC/CA materials were tested and the results are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI). CA is hydrophobic with an average contact angle of 121.2°, but BC is hydrophilic with an average contact angle\nof 32.1°. The contact angles of the BC/CA materials lie between those of the BC and CA, ranging from 53.3° to 100.8°. The tensile stress-strain curves (Fig. 4A) show that the maximum stress and strain at break are different. The quantitative results of tensile strength, Young s modulus, and strain at break are shown in Fig. 4B-D. Note that CA shows the lowest tensile strength (0.14 ± 0.03 MPa) and Young s modulus (1.09 ± 0.14 MPa), but the highest strain at break (38.56 ± 1.38%). BC exhibits a tensile strength of 0.95 ± 0.12 MPa, which is higher than that (0.38 ± 0.1 MPa) reported by Xie et al.41 As shown in Fig. 4B and C, adding BC to CA significantly increases the tensile strength and Young s modulus. Furthermore, BC/CA-2, BC/CA-3, and BC/CA-4 show significantly higher tensile strength, Young s modulus and strain at break compared with BC (p < 0.05 for tensile strength and strain, and p < 0.01 for Young s modulus).\n0 10 20 30 40 50 0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nT e n\nsi le\ns tr\ne ss\n( M\nP a )\nStrain (%)\nCA\nBC/CA-1\nBC BC/CA-2\nBC/CA-3\nBC/CA-4\nBC CA\nBC /C\nA1\nBC /C\nA2\nBC /C\nA3\nBC /C\nA4\n0.0\n0.4\n0.8\n1.2\n1.6\n2.0\n2.4\n2.8\nT e n\nsi le\ns tr\ne n\ng th\n( M\nP a )\nBC CA\nBC /C\nA1\nBC /C\nA2\nBC /C\nA3\nBC /C\nA4\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nY o u\nn g 's\nm o d\nu lu\ns (M\nP a )\nBC CA\nBC /C\nA1\nBC /C\nA2\nBC /C\nA3\nBC /C\nA4\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nE n\nlo n\ng a ti\no n\na t\nb re\na k\n( %\n)\nA\nC D\nB\nFigure 4 Mechanical properties of BC, CA, and BC/CA materials: (A) Typical stress-strain curves, (B) Tensile strength, (C) Young s modulus, (D) Strain at break.

The quantitative results are displayed in Fig. 5B and the scheme showing the locations of platelets on BC/CA grafts is illustrated in Fig. 5C. A large number of platelets adhere on the surfaces of BC and BC/CA-4, partially showing irregular\nmorphology, aggregation, and widely spread shape, which may indicate activation and potential for thrombus formation.44, 45 The number of adherent platelets was quantified via the LDH assay (Fig. 5B). Note that significantly fewer platelets are observed on BC/CA-1 and BC/CA-2 as compared to BC/CA-3 and BC/CA-4 (p < 0.05). There is no significant difference in the number of adhered platelets between BC/CA-1 and BC/CA-2, and a few observed exhibit grainy shape without pseudopodia or deformation (Fig. 5A), indicating that they are not activated. This result suggests that BC/CA-1 and BC/CA-2 grafts have good hemocompatibility and anti-thrombogenic potential.\nPage 7 of 15 Journal of Materials Chemistry B\nJo ur\nna lo\nfM at\ner ia\nls C\nhe m\nis tr\ny B\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\n0 3\nJu ne\n2 02\n0.

To further evaluate the performance of BC/CA grafts, BC/CA-2 was selected for Western blotting assay and in vivo biocompatibility assessment, which exhibits improved mechanical properties than BC/CA-1, and comparable in vitro biocompatibility, hemolysis rate, and platelet adhesion and activation. To further demonstrate the advantage of BC/CA grafts, the expression of CD31 protein was assessed using the Western blotting assay. The results shown in Fig. 7A and B reveals the relative expression of CD31 (0.82 ± 0.08) on BC/CA-2 is 1.6 times higher than BC (0.50 ± 0.01), and is also significantly higher than CA (0.72 ± 0.06, p < 0.05). The expressions of the HUVEC-specific markers, genes vWF-1 and CD31, were examined at the mRNA level. As shown in Fig. 7C, the relative expression levels of vWF and CD31 on BC/CA-2\nare significantly higher than those on BC and CA (p < 0.01).\nPage 9 of 15 Journal of Materials Chemistry B\nJo ur\nna lo\nfM at\ner ia\nls C\nhe m\nis tr\ny B\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\n0 3\nJu ne\n2 02\n0.

The H&E staining images in Fig. 8A reveal fewer inflammatory cells around the BC/CA-2 graft as compared to BC and CA grafts. The Masson's\ntrichrome staining results (Fig. 8B) demonstrate a thinner fibrotic capsule around BC/CA-2 graft as compared to BC and CA grafts. The results of immunohistochemical DAB staining (Fig. 8C) presents that there are a large number of inflammatory cells of CD8+ in the surrounding tissues of BC and CA grafts, while the BC/CA-2 graft shows much fewer inflammatory cells, indicating less rejection reaction of the BC/CA-2 graft than BC and CA grafts. These results suggest that the BC/CA-2 graft has improved in vivo biocompatibility over bare BC and CA grafts.\nPage 10 of 15Journal of Materials Chemistry B\nJo ur\nna lo\nfM at\ner ia\nls C\nhe m\nis tr\ny B\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\n0 3\nJu ne\n2 02\n0.

Among these methods, electrospinning is the most widely used. However, it is not easy to fabricate fibers with diameters down to the nanoscale (the lower limit of 50 nm in natural ECMs).63, 64 Mimicking the nano/submicrofibrous morphology of native blood vessels still remains a great challenge. In this study, we developed morphologically biomimetic vascular grafts composed of BC nanofibers and CA submicrofibers using a combined method of electrospinning and step-by-step in situ biosynthesis. We previously prepared nano/submicro-fibrous scaffolds for tissue engineering or cancer cell culture.16, 17, 65 Although the nano/submicro-fibrous structure was mimicked, the BC/CA ratio has not been modulated, which might affect the morphology, mechanics and in vitro/in vivo biological behaviors of the BC/CA grafts, particularly endothelialization. In this study, we can control the BC/CA ratio by adjusting the in situ biosynthesis duration. The result in Table S1 confirms that the content of BC nanofibers varies from 2.7 to 9.1 wt% and more importantly it affects the mechanical properties of the BC/CA grafts. All BC/CA grafts except for BC/CA-1 exhibit significantly higher tensile strength and Young s modulus compared with bare BC (p < 0.05), which, when used alone, has been reported as an appropriate material for vascular graft.19-21, 25 It is therefore deduced that BC/CA-2, BC/CA-3, and BC/CA-4 have suitable mechanical properties for vascular grafts. SEM observation demonstrates that the fiber diameters of BC nanofibers and CA submicrofibers are 46 - 50 nm and 0.64 - 0.92 R 3 respectively, which are comparable to the size range of collagen fibers in native tissues. The diameter of fibers plays an important role in the adhesion of the cells to the fibers.66, 67 Previous in vitro experiments demonstrated that micron-sized fibrous substrates could support human HUVEC monolayer formation,68 while other studies suggested that small-diameter fibers represent a better basis for endothelialization.69-71 For instance, Milleret et al. claimed that thin fibers (diameter < 1 R # triggered very low coagulation and few adhered platelets while larger fiber diameter (2 - 3 R # triggered higher thrombosis formation and more adhered platelets.69 These findings seemed to indicate that grafts with small fiber diameter could reduce early thrombogenicity due to lower platelet adhesion and activation. However, no report can be found in literature on the use of ultra-thin (< 100 nm) fibrous structure as vascular grafts except for nanofibrous BC. It is noteworthy that although bare BC grafts demonstrated good functions,19-25 the combination of BC nanofibers with submicrofibers as vascular grafts has not yet been reported. The activation of platelets is considered to be the first step of thrombogenesis, compromising the patency of vascular grafts.72 As displayed in Fig. 5 and Table 1, the BC/CA-2 graft exhibits lower platelet adhesion and hemolysis rate compared with the other grafts, suggesting that improved hemocompatibility may be achieved by optimizing the BC content. As shown in Fig. 6A and B, endothelialization of the BC/CA-2 graft quickly occurs. Furthermore, Western blotting and RTqPCR results (Fig. 7) confirm the enhanced expressions of protein CD31 and genes CD31 and vWF-1 from BC/CA-2 samples as compared to single BC and CA samples. CD31 is highly localized in endothelial cell junctions for robust endothelialized structure.73 CD31 not only participates in the construction and maintenance of a stable endothelial cell layer, but is also related to neo-vascularization and angiogenesis.74 It is believed that vWF-1 is a vital predictor of endothelialization after graft implantation in blood vessel.75 Therefore, together with the in vitro endothelialization result, the Western blotting and RT-qPCR results suggest that the BC/CA-2 graft can promote endothelialization, and thus reduce formation of thrombosis and increase patency. Subcutaneous implantation into animals is important for the evaluation of in vivo biocompatibility of materials before in situ implantation. The results in Fig. 8 display lower inflammatory response of BC/CA-2 as compared to bare BC and CA. Therefore, both the in vitro (Fig. 6C) and in vivo biocompatibility experiments confirm that the BC/CA-2 possesses excellent biocompatibility, demonstrating great potential to be used as vascular grafts. The overall excellent performance of BC/CA-2 graft can be explained as follows: (1) Chemically, cellulose is believed to be nonthrombogenic with low platelet adhesion and low coagulation activation 76 and more importantly BC has been confirmed by many researchers to have great potential for vascular grafts.19-25 (2) Mechanically, BC/CA-2 shows a higher tensile strength than bare BC and is comparable to that of human umbilical vein.77 (3) More importantly, morphologically, the size of BC nanofibers is close to that of the lower limit of collagen fibrils (50 nm) in native tissues and the CA submicrofibers show comparable size to that of the upper limit of native collagen fibrils (500 nm), which means that the BC/CA-2 possesses biomimetic nano/submicro-fibrous morphology that contributes to cell spreading and cell functions.78, 79"

      "text" : "The nano/submicro-fibrous BC/CA grafts with biomimetic structure have been fabricated via a combined method of electrospinning and modified in situ biosynthesis. The BC/CA grafts show fibrous and interconnected porous structure with nanofibers (46 - 50 nm) and submicrofibers (0.64 - 0.92 R #! The mechanical properties of the nano/submicrofibrous BC/CA grafts (except for BC/CA-1) are improved compared with CA and BC grafts, due to the mechanical entanglement and hydrogen bonding between BC nanofibers and CA submicrofibers. Endothelial cells actively spread with a higher density after seeding on the surface of the BC/CA-2 graft for 7 days, compared with BC/CA-3 and BC/CA-4 grafts, showing promotion of endothelialization by the BC/CA-2 graft. The platelet adhesion test demonstrates that fewer adhered platelets are observed on the BC/CA-2 graft and the hemolysis assay result displays lower hemolysis rate for the BC/CA-2 graft, compared with the BC/CA-3 and BC/CA-4 grafts.

Western blotting and RT-qPCR results demonstrate promoted endothelialization of the BC/CA-2 graft by upregulating expressions of genes vWF-1 and CD31 as well as protein CD31. In vivo results demonstrate that the BC/CA-2 graft displays significantly better biocompatibility than nanofibrous BC and submicrofibrous CA grafts. These findings suggest that the BC/CA-2 graft shows a great potential as a new type of vascular grafts. This study provides a new guideline for the development of biomimetic vascular grafts."
