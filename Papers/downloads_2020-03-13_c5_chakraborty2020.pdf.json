Feynman during his most famous lecture on 1959 ‘‘There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,” (Feynman, 1960). However, it is mentioned by an eminent scientist and visionary in his book “Engines of Creation” (Drexler, 1986) that the term “Nanotechnology” was first developed by Taniguchi in 1974, followed by popularized in the 1980s (Kumar et al., 2011). The term nanotechnology can commonly be defined as the understanding, control, and restructuring of matter on the order of nanometers (i.e., less than 100 nm) to create materials with fundamentally new properties and functions (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010; NSTC, 2007). Usually, the nanotechnology encompasses two main approaches such as top-down (through the process of deconstruction of larger structures into their smaller) and bottom-up (through the process of atoms/molecular assembling) (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). There are many revolutionary progress and developments in physics, chemistry, and biology by manipulating matter at an extremely small scale, i.e., the nano-scale (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). Currently, the impact of nanotechnology on the construction materials including the binding materials has been investigated significantly (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010; Torgal and Jalali, 2011) and assumed that the civil and infrastructural industries, can be a major beneficiary of nanotechnology (Singh et al., 2017). The report RILEM TC 197-NCM, ‘‘Nanotechnology in construction materials” (Zhu et al., 2004), is the first document that represents clearly the potential impact of nanotechnology for the development of construction and building materials, namely: the use of nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes and nanofibers to increase the strength and durability of cementitious composites as well as for pollution reduction, production of cheap corrosion-free steel, production of thermal insulation materials with an adequately performance than that of current options available commercially, production of coatings and thin films with self-cleaning ability and self-colour change to minimize energy consumption, production of nanosensors and materials with sensing ability and self-repairing ability (Torgal and Jalali, 2011).\nConcrete is a most used manmade material consisting of cement, aggregates, and water, that can be considered as multiscale composites starting from nano-scale hydrates to macro-scale aggregates (Singh et al., 2017). The massive use of concrete increases the consumption of binder and energy as well, thereby increases the production of Portland cement, which, in turn, contributes to environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emission (7% of total manmade emission) by releasing 800 kg of CO2 during the production of 1t cement (Singh et al., 2017; Jo et al., 2014a). Hence, the prime challenge of cement and concrete construction industries is to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission by developing innovative and sustainable cement-based materials utilizing natural resources or industrial waste products. Some literature reported that the most feasible way to meet the challenges would be (1) the production of nano cement/nano modified cement and understand the hydration behavior of nanomodified cementitious materials and (2) development of alternative cementitious material preferably in nano dimension utilizing natural resources and industrial wastes (Singh et al., 2017; Jo et al., 2014a; Chakraborty\net al., 2017). Numerous literature reported that the application of nanotechnology in producing cement concrete refers to the addition of nanosized particles (namely, nano-SiO2, nano-TiO2, nano-Al2O3, nano-Fe2O3, etc., nanofiber or nanotube, viz., carbon nanotube (CNT), carbon nanofibers (CNF)) to the concrete system at suitable proportions by appropriate methods to improve the strength, hydration behavior, pore characteristics, interface interaction at the transition zone (ITZ), and durability of concrete (Singh et al., 2017; Rao et al., 2015; Jo et al., 2014a; Birgisson et al., 2012; Torgal and Jalali, 2011; Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). Additionally, it is reported that the presence of nanomaterials reduces the amount of cement content in concrete than the conventional concrete without sacrificing strength characteristics. Hence, it is possible to produce eco-friendly concrete with the help of nanotechnology (Rao et al., 2015; Jayapalan et al., 2013).\nTo date, an adequate advancement in developing nano-engineered concrete (knowledge and understanding of basic phenomena in cement at the nano-scale) has been achieved by nano modification and addition of nanosized additives into the cement concrete system; however, nanotechnology applications in the construction and building materials fields have found to be uneven (Bartos, 2009). Limited attention has been paid to develop nano-sized cement particle by the top-down method and nano-cement/innovative alternative cementitious materials by the bottom-up method; (Jo et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2014c; Lee and Kriven, 2005; Sobolev and Ferrada-Gutiérrez, 2005a, 2005b). Additionally, implementation of nanotechnology in the field of concrete construction on a commercial scale remains limited except a few results successfully converted into marketable products due to the exploitation of the knowledge of physical, chemical, and structural mechanisms at the nanometer scale (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). Hence, in this chapter, the impact of top-down and the bottom-up nanotechnology concept on the synthesis/production, characterization, and properties evaluation of nanosized cement/nano cementitious materials has been studied providing two case studies."

      "text" : "Concrete is a paramount used manmade material and considered as a most ubiquitous material in the world (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). It is a composite material, consists of multiphase components, i.e., amorphous and crystalline component, belonging to the multi-scale structures starting with nano-scale hydrates to macroscale aggregates (as shown in Fig. 7.1). The properties of concrete, including the degradation mechanism, occur at multiple length scales where the properties of each scale derive from those of the next smaller scale (Jennings et al., 2008; Sanchez et al., 2009; Sanchez and Borwankar, 2010). In fact, the properties of concrete are controlled by the hydrated cement products, namely, crystalline calcium hydroxide (CH) and amorphous/semi-crystalline calcium-silicate-hydrate (CeSeH). The CeS eH itself is a nanomaterial, acts a glue and holds the concrete components together,\ncontributes to control the properties and performances of concrete at the macroscale (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010).\nViewing in the light of nanotechnology concept, the solidification of concrete by the cement hydration is the nanoscale molecular assemblage of the hydrated products that, in turn, develops the chemical bonds, intermolecular forces, and interphase diffusion. The structure of the amorphous and crystalline phases and of the interphase boundaries originate from this scale. Hence, the processes occurring at the nano-scale during solidification of concrete ultimately affect the engineering properties and performance of the bulk concrete/construction material (Garboczi and Bentz, 1996, 1998; Xi et al., 2000; Scrivener and Kirkpatrick, 2008; Jennings et al., 2008; Sanchez et al., 2009). Additionally, nanoscience deals with the measurement, characterization, and molecular level modeling of the nano and microscale structure of cement-based materials to better understand the properties and performance of concrete at the macroscale (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010).\nThe nano-engineering usually done by nano-scale modification (nanomodification) of concrete is the term that is often used to describe the application of nanotechnology in concrete research (Garboczi, 2009; Raki et al., 2009; Scrivener, 2009; Scrivener and Kirkpatrick, 2008).; Basically, the nano-engineering is the technique of manipulation of the structure at the nanometer scale, can effectively done by bottom-up nanotechnology approach, to develop a new generation of tailored, multifunctional, cementitious composites with superior mechanical performance\nand durability potentially having a range of novel properties such as: low electrical resistivity, self-sensing capabilities, self-cleaning, self-healing, high ductility, and self-control of cracks (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). The nanoeengineering/nanomodification of concrete can be done by the incorporation of nanosized objects (e.g., nanoparticles and nanotubes) to control concrete’s behavior and add novel properties, or by the grafting of molecules onto cement particles, cement phases, aggregates, and additives (including nanosized additives) to provide surface functionality, which can be adjusted to promote specific interfacial interactions (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010)."

      "heading" : "3. Nanotechnology approaches",
      "text" : "Usually, the nanotechnology encompasses two basic approaches such as top-down and bottom-up (Wang and Xia, 2004). The top-down approach is a method of nano-scale materials processing technique through which the larger structures are reduced in size to the nano-scale maintaining their original properties without controlling the atomic-levels (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010; Jo et al., 2014a, 2014c). On the other ways, in the top-down method, the composite materials are deconstructed from larger structures into their smaller composite parts without affecting their original behavior (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). In fact, the top-down approach starts from a bulk material that incorporates critical nano-scale details. In this approach, a material can be engineered by scaling down a complex entity into its component parts (Liu et al., 2011). For example of biomaterials processing technique, the small crystals from a bulk mineralized hard tissue can be created via acid-etching. Similarly, for the case of cementitious materials processing, comminution of the microscale cement particle to the ultrafine level (350w220 nm) can be done through grinding/milling (Jo et al., 2014c; Sobolev and Ferrada-Gutiérrez, 2005a, 2005b).\nOn the other hand, the ‘‘bottom-up” approach, also termed as ‘‘molecular nanotechnology” or ‘‘molecular manufacturing,” introduced by (Drexler et al., 1991); in which the materials are engineered from atoms or molecular components through a process of assembly or self-assembly (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). Fig. 7.2 represents a pictorial view of top-down and bottom-up approaches for nano-scale materials processing (collected from (Sobolev and Ferrada-Gutiérrez, 2005a; Sobolev and Ferrada-Gutiérrez, 2005b; Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). It is reported elsewhere that though the most contemporary technologies rely on the ‘‘top-down” approach; however, molecular nanotechnology (bottom-up approach) holds the great promise for breakthroughs in materials and manufacturing, electronics, medicine and healthcare, energy, biotechnology, information technology, and national security as well (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). In fact, the hybridization and grafting of molecules can occur easily through the bottom-up approach that may allow for the direct\nmanipulation of the fundamental structure of materials (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). Currently, the precise control of crystal growth at the nano-scale and the creation of natural structures of materials based on the bottom-up self-assembly mechanisms have inspired the scientists to control the materials properties by nano-engineering/nano modification (Xu et al., 2007; Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010; Singh et al., 2017). To date, the advances in nano-engineered concrete are based on the nano modifications of concrete structures. The basic concept of nanomodification is the bottom-up engineering, starting with engineered modifications to the nano-scale structure/phase of cement concrete with an aim to improve the bulk properties of concrete (Birgisson et al., 2012)."

      "text" : "The top-down nano-engineering of cementitious material is mainly based on the comminution of the micro-scale cement particle to the ultrafine level (350w220 nm) through physicomechanical crushing (Balaguru and Chong, 2006; Huang et al., 2003; Jo et al., 2014c; Pilevneli et al., 2004; Sarkar and Wheeler, 2001; Sobolev and Ferrada-Gutiérrez, 2005a, 2005b) stated that the concrete containing <500 nm particle can be considered as a nano cement concrete. It is reported elsewhere that the fine cement of the particle size 200e2 mm can be produced by the grinding of the cement using ball mill, vibration mill, Raymond mill, mixing mill or air-blow mill, stirred mill, and so forth (Sobolev and FerradaGutiérrez, 2005a, 2005b; Pilevneli et al., 2004; Sarkar and Wheeler, 2001; Huang et al., 2003). It is also reported that the milling process increases the surface area of cement particles which in turn, exposes the higher surface area of cement for hydration reaction, as a result, the rate of hydration reaction can be increased (Singh et al., 2017; Jo et al., 2014c). The faster rate of cement hydration reaction leads to developing the early strength gaining capability of cement concrete that in turn, reduces the time for the building construction (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). On the other hand, the increased surface area of cement particle may lead to the agglomeration of the particles (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). Therefore, a special arrangement is sought for its storage and packing, consequently, the ultimate cost of the ultrafine cement may increase (Huang et al., 2003).\n(Pilevneli et al., 2004) reported a pilot scale dry grinding of cement by the open and closed circuit tube milling method using a vertical stirred mill. They stated that the prime reason for using stirred mills is their energetic efficiency in the production of submicron particles compared to other conventional grinding systems such as ball milling. Results of this pilot-scale investigation revealed that a more finished and comparatively smaller size (average particle size 20e25 mm) of cement particle can be produced by open and closed circuit stirred milling method (Sarkar and Wheeler, 2001). reported the setting performances of ultrafine cement (<10 mm) produced by grinding. They stated that the substantial increment of the specific surface area of cement is achieved due to the size reduction of cement particle that in turn, accelerates the cement setting and increases the early age strength gaining capability. However, it may cause the strength retrogression at the later age.\nAdditionally, the wet grinding method possessed the significant potential to produce ultrafine cement as stated by (Huang et al., 2003). They reported a new preparation technology for producing wet-ground fine cement (WFC). The maximum size of cement particles in the slurry is not bigger than 40 mm and the average size (50%\nby weight) is less than 10 mm after using wet-ground technology. In fact, wet-grinding was first reported in Japan to prepare the slurry of fine cement (called WMCmethod). OPC was ground by a drum attrition mill to decrease the particle size in grouting fields (Huang et al., 2003). In this technology, the produced particle size depends on the milling time and thus, the longer milling time produces the finer cement particles. As the particle of cement becomes fine, therefore, there is a possibility of agglomeration. Hence, by avoiding package and storage designed especially for fine cement, WMC technology had been applied in many grouting projects as reported by (Huang et al., 2003).\nThough the numerous research investigations were executed for producing ultrafine cement using top-down physic-mechanical grinding approach, however, very few investigations can able to produce nano-scale cement particles. Hence, with the aim to produce ultrafine (submicro) cement using the physic-mechanical crushing (top-down) method, bead milling technique was used by (Jo et al., 2014c). The following summarizes the effect of bead milling process (considered as top-down nanotechnology approach) to produce ultrafine cement of the particle size 220 nm from the ordinary portland cement of 10e30 mm particles as a case study.\n4.1.2 Case study on ultrafine cement production by top-down nanotechnology concept\n4.1.2.1 Production of ultrafine cement The case summarizes the processing, characterization, and properties of ultrafine cement (particle size belongs to the nanometer scale). The study reported the production of ultrafine ordinary Portland cement (OPC) from micro-particles of OPC using the bed milling wet grinding method. The bead mill is a type of the stirring mill;\ntherefore, the grinding of cement particles was performed by abrasive and shear forces developed in the mill as a grinding force. A schematic of horizontal bed mill is represented in Fig. 7.3 (collected from (Jo et al., 2014c). In this milling process, comminution of cement particle depends on several parameters such as grinding media, grinding force, and agitation speed, etc. In this case, grinding of cement was done at 3600 RPM agitation speed in the presence of two different grinding agents, viz., methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH), for three different times such as 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h (Jo et al., 2014c). describes in detail the comminution of micro-scale OPC particles by the bed milling process to produce nano-scale particle.\n4.1.2.2 Characterization of ultrafine cement In order to evaluate the properties of nano-scale OPC particles produced by the bed milling process and compare these with the micro-scale OPC particles, the particle size distribution, the oxide composition, chemical phases, and microstructures were analyzed using LA-950 laser particle size analyser (Horiba Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), EDXRF (Rigaku NEX QC energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) analyzer), XRD (Ultima III, Rigaku Inc., Japan), and a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-6700F, JEOL USA), respectively. Please follow (Jo et al., 2014c) for detail characterization techniques.\n4.1.2.3 Properties of ultrafine cement 4.1.2.3.1 Particle size distribution The particle size analysis revealed that 10, 50, and 90% of the OPC particles possess the size w2.43 mm, w12.57 mm, and w38.77 mm, respectively. Whilst, a significant reduction of the particle was observed after 1, 3, and 6 h bed milling of OPC irrespective of the grinding agents used (methanol and ethanol) as shown in Table 7.1 (Jo et al., 2014c). Fig. 7.4 represents the particle size distribution pattern of OPC after 6 h bed milling using ethanol as a grinding agent (adopted from (Jo et al., 2014c). Analysing the result, it is\nReproduced with permission from Jo, B.W., Chakraborty, S., Yoon, K.W., 2014a.

In fact, the particle size of the 50% OPC is reduced to 240 nm and 200 nm after 3 h and 6 h milling, respectively, in the presence of the ethanol (C2H5OH) as grinding agent (Jo et al., 2014c). It is reported elsewhere (Balaguru and Chong, 2006) that the cement particle less than 500 nm can be termed as nano-cement. Prior to this investigation, a very few researchers have attempted to produce ultrafine cement using grinding/milling method (Sobolev and Ferrada-Gutiérrez, 2005a, 2005b; Pilevneli et al., 2004; Sarkar and Wheeler, 2001; Huang et al., 2003). Therefore, it is considered that the bed milling process is an effective technique to reduce the particle size of OPC to the nano-scale level.\n4.1.2.3.2 Chemical composition and phase analysis After analysing the chemical composition of OPC using EDXRF, it was observed that the OPC contain the same oxide minerals with the identical amount before and after grinding (milling). In fact, OPC contained 61.3% CaO, 21.1% SiO2, 4.0% MgO, 5.2% Al2O3, 2.8% Fe2O3, and 2.4% SO3 before and after milling (Jo et al., 2014c). Additionally, the loss of ignition was found to be the same (2.0%) before and after milling of OPC. On the other hand, XRD analysis revealed that the ultrafine OPC produced by the bed milling method and the original OPC both contained the identical phases at the same XRD coordinates with the similar intensity (except a very few changes in intensity due to more active characteristics of ultrafine cement) (Jo et al., 2014c). Hence, it is considered that grinding of OPC by bed milling as a top-down nanotechnology method can produce the nano-scale cement particle without affecting the chemical composition and characteristics.\n4.1.2.3.3 Microstructure analysis Finally, the reduction of the particle size of OPC by bed milling process was verified by the microstructure analysis. Fig. 7.5\nrepresents the SEM micrograph of OPC before and after grinding (6 h) (Jo et al., 2014c). Microstructure analysis revealed that the original OPC particles belong to the micro-scale level; whilst, the OPC particles after 6 h grinding belong to the nano-scale level. Hence, the microstructural observation possessed a good agreement with the particle size distribution analysis. Accordingly, it is apparent that the wet grinding of the cement utilizing bead milling process can able to produce the nano-scale cement particle. As the bed milling method reduces the particle size of cement from bulk scale to the nanometer scale without affecting the original characteristics of cement, therefore, it can be considered as a top-down nanotechnology method to produce nano cement (Jo et al., 2014c).\nThough the bed milling process can effectively reduce the particle size of OPC to the nano-scale level; however, the method is still under consideration of the laboratory scale developments. No industrial protocol has yet been developed to implement this technology for the bulk production of nano-cement. Additionally, the cost for the production of nano-cement using this technique is not yet reported. As this technique is based on the milling process; therefore, it is assumed that it may consume extra energy for the comminution of OPC particle that in turn, increase the ultimate cost of the cement. The increased cost may be compensated by reducing the consumption of cement using the ultra-high performance of cement (nano-cement). Therefore, an optimised protocol needs to be developed prior to implementing this technology practically. Conversely, the nano-scale engineering of cement and/the production of alternative cementitious material using bottom-up nanotechnology concept may have the beneficial impact in this occasion."

In fact, the bottom-up nano-engineering can be done either by the direct modification of cementitious materials and hydrates using nano additives and/reinforcements or assembling the molecules at the nanometer scale of materials that in turn, finally develop a superior concrete by controlling the concrete properties, performance, and degradation processes and providing the material with new functions and smart properties (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). Though the hybridization and grafting of molecules allow for the direct manipulation of the fundamental structure of cement phases that may lead to providing the superior properties and performances of concrete; however, these techniques are still difficult for the concrete science and engineering field (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). The nano-scale concrete engineering can take place in three locations, i.e., in the solid phases, in the liquid phase, and at interfaces, including liquidesolid and solid-solid interfaces. (Garboczi, 2009). It is reported that the nano-engineering of cement-based materials possesses tremendous potential to control the properties of concrete, nonetheless, several challenges are still needed to be solved for realizing its full potential, including the proper dispersion of the nano-scale additives, scale-up of laboratory results and implementation on larger scale, and a lowering of the cost-benefit ratio (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). The following some nano modification of cement-based materials using nano additives, nano-reinforcements, and nano-scale hydrate hybridization have been discussed, including a case study for the hydrothermal production of an alternative cementitious material (nano cement) with nano-scale particle size.\n4.2.1 Nano modification of concrete using nanostructured materials (nano additives)\nTo date, the advancements in the nono modification of cement concrete encompass the addition of nanostructure materials. Nanosized particles possess a high surface area to volume ratio that in turn, provides the significant potential for chemical reactivity (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). In fact, nanoparticles can act as nuclei for cement phases that may lead to promoting the cement hydration reaction due to their high reactivity. Consequently, a dense microstructure can be appeared by improving the interfacial interaction at the ITZ of concrete system, thereby leading to the reduction of porosity and delivering the ultra-high performances introducing the new functions and smart properties (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010; Singh et al., 2017; Birgisson et al., 2012; Barbhuiya et al., 2015). Much of the research work on the nano modification of cement and concrete using nano-additives to date have been dealt with the addition of nano-silica (nano-SiO2) (Bjornstrom et al., 2004; Li et al., 2004a; Ji, 2005); Li et al., 2006; (Jo et al., 2007; Qing et al., 2007, 2008; Lin et al., 2008a, 2008b; Sobolev et al., 2009; Aggarwal et al., 2015; Brzozowski et al., 2017; Arel and Thomas, 2017). Additionally, a few studies conducted on\nincorporating nano-iron (nano-Fe2O3) (Li et al., 2004a), nano-alumina (nano-Al2O3) (Li et al., 2006b), and nanoclay particles (Chang et al., 2007; Kuo et al., 2006).

Additionally, it helps to control the leaching of calcium (Gaitero et al., 2008) that in turn, resists the concrete degradation, thereby increasing the concrete’s life.

      "text" : "Nanoclay particles have possessed promising impact in enhancing the mechanical performance, resistance to chloride penetration, and the self-compacting properties of concrete (Kuo et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2007; He and Shi, 2008; Morsy et al., 2009). To date, most of the research work on the nano-clay embedded cement is based on the utilization of calcined clays, e.g., metakaolin (Siddique and Klaus,\n2009; Abo-El-Enein et al., 2014). Nowadays, the attention of the researchers attracted toward the possibilities of the nanoengineering of natural (non-calcined) clays. In fact, the clay particles are typically highly hydrophilic. Hence, the control of water requirements in clayecement composites is one of the most important issues that may be achieved by organic cation exchange modification through which organic cations replace sodium or calcium in the interlayer; as a result, the hydrophilicity of clay can be reduced (Kuo et al., 2006). Recently, chemical binding of PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) to exfoliated clay particles has been proposed to create linked clay particle chains. Incorporation of this linked clay in cement reveals benefits in improving the post-failure properties of the material (Birgisson and Beatty, 2007). Moreover, some non-modified nanosized smectite clays are used to modify the C eSeH structure by altering the nucleation of CeSeH (Lindgreen et al., 2008; Kroyer et al., 2003).\n4.2.2 Nano modification of concrete using nano-reinforcements (nanofibres/nanotubes)\nCarbon nanotubes/nanofibers (CNTs/CNFs) are reported to be the most promising nanomaterials used as nano-reinforcements in cement-based materials for enhancing the mechanical properties by improving the resistance to crack propagation of cement-based materials along with providing some novel properties such as electromagnetic field shielding and self-sensing capabilities (Stynoski et al., 2015; Makar et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007a, 2007b). In fact, CNTs/CNFs exhibit superior strength (tensile) and moduli of elasticity in the range of TPa and GPa, respectively, with the unique electronic and chemical properties (Ajayan, 1999; Salvetat et al., 1999; Srivastava et al., 2003). Additionally, the CNTs (single-wall CNTs (SWCNTs) and multi-wall CNTs (MWCNTs) and CNFs are graphene ring-based highly structured materials with very large aspect ratios (in the range of 1000/more) and very high surface areas (Xie et al., 2005). To date, most research efforts have focused on the utilization of CNTs (single-wall CNTs (SWCNTs), multi-wall CNTs (MWCNTs)) compared to CNFs for the preparation of cement pastes (Makar et al., 2005; Shah et al., 2009; Cwirzen et al., 2008, 2009a; Saez de Ibarra et al., 2006; Konsta-Gdoutos et al., 2010; Stynoski et al., 2015); however, limited attention has been paid to produce mortar with CNFs (Li et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b). In fact, due to their high hydrophobicity and strong self-interaction, the proper dispersion of CNTs/CNFs into cement paste becomes the major challenge that needs to be resolved for the production of CNT/CNF based cement mortar/concrete.\nHence, the several methods have been adopted to improve dispersion of CNT/ CNF in cement concrete system for enhancing the interfacial interaction and ultimate properties of cement concrete through surface functionalization and coating, optimal physical blending, and the use of surfactant and other admixtures (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). Though it is rather complex to prove the mechanism behind the achievement of the superior performances of CNTs/CNFs based cement concrete; nonetheless, good interfacial interaction between CNTs/CNFs and cement phases leading to bridging cracks and stress transfer has been demonstrated very effectively\nby several researchers (Ajayan, 1999; Salvetat et al., 1999; Srivastava et al., 2003; Makar et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007a, 2007b). (Makar et al., 2005) reported among the first the early-age cement hydration effect of CNTs and formation of a strong bond between cement paste and CNTs. It is reported that the dispersion of CNTs in isopropanol by sonication, followed by mixing with cement, evaporation, and grinding lead to produce CNTs coated cement. The critical analysis was done by some researchers investigating that the use of dispersing agents, functionalization, pre-treatment prior to mixing, ultrasonic vibration, super-plasticizer, viscosity modifier, pre-dispersion in acetone, etc., (surfactants) are more effective approach to enhance mechanical properties of CNTs based cement than that of the without dispersing agent used (Shah et al., 2009; Cwirzen et al., 2008, 2009a, 2009b; Saez de Ibarra et al., 2006; Konsta-Gdoutos et al., 2010; Li et al., 2005; Musso et al., 2009; Sanchez and Ince, 2009; Sanchez, 2009; Stynoski et al., 2015). Hence, it is demonstrated that the resolving the dispersion issue of CNTs/CNFs in cement concrete system holds the key to optimizing the benefits of CNTs/CNFs addition to concrete and leads to improve the fundamental understanding of the interfacial interaction and minimize the complexity in evaluating the mechanism of the superior performances of CNTs/CNFs based cement concrete.\n4.2.3 Nano modification of CeSeH (hydrate hybridization)\nNano-scale modification of CeSeH structure using some organic molecules often termed as hydrate hybridization has been attracted the attention of researchers to produce more sustainable nano-cementitious composites (Raki et al., 2009; Beaudoin et al., 2008, 2009a, 2009b; Minet et al., 2006; Franceschini et al., 2007). In fact, the layered structures and the structural defects in the silicate chains (missing bridging tetrahedra) of CeSeH (Cong and Kirkpatrick, 1996; Chen et al., 2004) create opportunity for the potential manipulation of basic CeSeH structure by the insertion of a variety of organic molecules (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). Usually, three schemes for CeSeH hydrate hybridization have been proposed such as (1) intercalation of organic molecules into the CeSeH layer (Matsuyama and Young, 1999), (2) bonding (covalent) of guest molecule with the silicate structures (Franceschini et al., 2007), and (3) the grafting of guest molecules at the defect sites of the silicate chain (Beaudoin et al., 2008, 2009a, 2009b). It is reported elsewhere that the small-sized organic molecules can be linked directly and accommodated in the interlayer space of the silicate chains (Minet et al., 2006); however, incorporation of a large-sized molecule may occur phase separation. Additionally, some covalently bonded polymereCeSeH hybrids can be produced using organic chains containing T-silane group without hampering the internal structure of CeSeH (Franceschini et al., 2007) and some nanomodified CeSeH can be produced by grafting of HTDMA (hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium), PEG (polyethylene glycol), and methylene blue dye, etc., at the missing site of silicate tetrahedra of CeSeH (Beaudoin et al., 2008, 2009a, 2009b). Though some research work on the hydrate hybridization were executed; however, these schemes are already a source of debate, including the partial intercalation into the interlamellar space of the CeSeH,\ntemperature and drying conditions, and the effectiveness of the Ca/Si ratio on the grafting of the CeSeH (Raki et al., 2009). Hence, much attention needs to be paid on the nano-scale hydrate hybridisation for practical implementation of the technology."

Though the adequate research investigations have been carried out on the nano-engineering concrete structures; however, a very limited attention has been paid on the production of nanosized cement particles and of nano-binders (Sobolev and Ferrada-Gutiérrez, 2005a, 2005b; Lee and Kriven, 2005; Jo et al., 2011, 2014a).

In fact, they conducted an investigation on the synthesis and hydration study of Portland cement components prepared by the organic steric entrapment method using PVA as a complexation agent. In this method, C2S, C3S, C3A, C4AF were produced by the sol-gel method using colloidal silica as the silica source, nitrate salts of several cations as cation sources, and PVA as complexation agent with controlled heating, followed by calcination at low temperature compared to that of the normal cement production method. It is reported that the PVA method can produce relatively pure synthetic cement components of sub-micron/nano-scale crystallite dimension with high specific surface area and extremely high reactivity at relatively low calcining and crystallization temperatures. Additionally, it is reported that synthesized powders showed faster-setting speed and higher early compressive strength than that of the commercial white cement paste. The fast setting and the early compressive strength development of synthesized cement have been attributed due to the rapid formation of Ca(OH)2 and CeSeH.\n4.2.4.2 Synthesis of nanosized b-dicalcium silicate by sol-gel method (Gajbhiye and Singh, 2010) have conducted an investigation for the production of b-dicalcium silicate by sol-gel method. In this study, they have produced Fe3þ doped and undoped b-dicalcium silicates (b-Ca2SiO4 or b-C2S) using sol-gel method. In fact, b-dicalcium silicate was produced using tetraethyl orthosilicate as the silicate precursor, calcium nitrate as calcium precursor and glacial acetic acid. The gel was produced by stirring magnetically for 3 h and aging for overnight. Finally, the gel was heated using a microwave oven for 10 min, followed by the calcination at 700 C in a muffle\nfurnace. The results revealed that solegel combined with microwave and conventional heating is a powerful method for the preparation of fine powders of b-dicalcium silicate. Additionally, doping of Fe3þ in the crystal lattice of b-C2S led to decrease the particle size b-C2S and improved the hydration characteristics."

      "text" : "(Jo et al., 2011, 2014a, 2014b, 2015a, 2016, 2017) reported the synthesis, characterization, application of the alternative cementitious (nano cement) material produced by the hydrothermal method. In fact, some of these literature highlight a procedure for the production of alternative cementitious material of the particle size w168 nm using nano-silica infused with hydrated alumina by the hydrothermal method along with its physical, chemical, hydration, and mechanical behavior. Additionally, others have described the effectiveness of carbonated slaked lime (calcium carbonate) in producing the carbon dioxide stored alternative cementitious material using hydrothermal method and the performance of carbon dioxide stored cementitious material in developing mortar/concrete (Jo et al., 2015a, 2016, 2017). The case study focuses on the production, characterization, and application of the alternative cementitious material.\n4.2.4.3.1 Production of alternative cementitious material (ACM) The ACM was produced by sol-gel method preparing an aqueous based high-density gel of nano silica and a low-density gel of hydrated alumina through the reaction of sodium aluminate and sodium hydroxide at 90 C (Jo et al., 2014). The source gel materials, such as silica source and alumina sources, were left undisturbed for 24 h to ripen, followed by mixing together using a turbine mixture, sonication for 3 h, and controlled oven drying for 15 days at 105 C for crystallization. Thus the obtained crystallized product was then washed with distilled water and filtered off using a membrane filter, followed by oven drying for 6 h at 105 C and grinding to obtain the powder (Jo et al., 2014b). Usually, the Portland cement contains three main components such as SiO2, Al2O3, and CaO. However, the synthesized material contained only SiO2 and Al2O3. Hence, the dried powder was treated with calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2) solution to increase the CaO content. Finally, the sample was allowed to centrifuge and filtered off, followed by oven drying at 105 C for 3 h and grinding to obtain alternative cementitious material. Fig. 7.6 represents the pictorial view of the ACM/nano cement synthesis procedure (Jo et al., 2014a). The steps followed in this method avoid the use of high temperature and calcination that may lead to minimising energy consumption and CO2 emission as well.\n4.2.4.3.2 Characterization of ACM In order to evaluate physical, chemical, and microstructural behavior of ACM, the particle size distribution using LA- 950 Laser particle size analyzer, specific gravity, and fineness were analyzed. The chemical composition and phases of ACM were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction study using Rigaku NEX QC (EDXRF) analyser and Ultima III X-ray diffractometer, Regaku Inc., respectively. The microstructure of the\nACM was analyzed using a Field emission scanning electron microscopic (FE-SEM), JEOL JSM-6700F, JEOL USA Inc (Jo et al., 2014a).\nThe setting and hardening performance of ACM was determined by analysing the setting time following the standard setting time measurement procedure of hydraulic cement using a Vicat apparatus. Finally, the effectiveness of the ACM in controlling the mechanical properties of mortar and concrete was evaluated by fabricating the ACM based mortar and concrete, followed by measuring their compressive and flexural strengths (Jo et al., 2014a).\n4.2.4.3.3 Properties evaluation By analysing the physical properties of ACM and comparing with OPC, it is found that the ACM contains finer particles (w168 nm) and possesses higher fineness than that of the OPC. Table 7.2 represents physical properties of ACM/nano cement produced synthetically by hydrothermal method and commercially available OPC (Jo et al., 2014a). The particle size distribution analysis reveals that w50% of the ACM particles possess less than 0.2 mm (Fig. 7.7) (Jo et al., 2014a). Hence, it can be considered that the hydrothermal method is able to produce ACM with the nano-scale particle using nano-silica infused with hydrated alumina. Additionally, extremely higher fineness of ACM may lead to occurring faster hydration due to the exposure of a greater surface area of ACM for hydration reaction.\nBy analysing the chemical composition, it is found that ACM contains similar phases with different percentages. Table 7.2 represents the chemical composition of ACM and OPC (Jo et al., 2014a). The ACM contains more amounts of SiO2 and Al2O3 than that of OPC. It indicates that ACM is composed of aluminosilicate compound which was further justified by the XRD analysis (as reported by (Jo et al., 2014a). The XRD analysis (not shown) revealed that the hydrated ACM mainly contains sodalite (Na8Al6Si6O24(OH)2 (H2O)2), natrite (Na2CO3), and gismondine (CaAl2Si2O8) 4H2O (Jo et al., 2014a). All these three compounds are aluminosilicate based. Hence, it can be considered that the ACM can produce\nTable 7.2 Physical properties and chemical composition of ACM/nano cement produced by hydrothermal method and commercially available ordinary Portland cement (OPC) (Jo et al., 2014a).\nType of cement\nPhysical properties Chemical composition (%)\nParticle size (mm)\nSpecific gravity\nFineness (cm2/ g) CaO Na2O SiO2 Al2O3 MgO Fe2O3 SO3 LOI\nOPC 10e30 3.15 w2800 64.33 e 20.36 5.77 2.05 2.84 2.51 2.0\nACM 0.167 2.11 3582400 3.71 5.31 42.8 21.9 0.41 2.37 e 0.32\nReproduced with permission from Jo, B.W., Chakraborty, S., Yoon, K.W., 2014a.

Additionally, the FESEM analysis of ACM supports the formation of the nano-scale particle of size w200 nm with structural equality by the hydrothermal method (Jo et al., 2014a).\nMoreover, the EDS analysis in conjunction with FESEM supports the chemical composition and phase analysis results of ACM. In fact, the EDS analysis also reveals that ACM contains mainly alumina silicate compound by evaluating elemental composition, i.e., 32.62% Si, 25.05% Al, 30.24% O, 10.09% Ca, and 2.00% Na (Jo et al., 2014a).\nFor the setting performance of cement, it is an important characteristic that describes the hardening performance of cement concrete. In fact, it is a result of the hydration reaction taken place among the cement phases. It is usually predicted by measuring the time need to harden the cement paste that is often termed as setting time. The setting of ACM occurs due to the condensation reaction between aluminosilicate compounds in the presence of alkali activator (50% NaOH) (Jo et al., 2014a). The prime reason for using alkali activator is the less reactivity of the alumina silicate compound with water at the normal environment. The alkali activator may supply the driving force to transpire the condensation reaction that may lead to producing calcium/(sodium) based alumina silicate hydrate instead of the formation of calcium silicate hydrate (Jo et al., 2014a). Consequently, the hardening of ACM based concrete/mortar takes place. It is reported that the initial and final setting time of ACM at 30 C are 230 min and 540 min, respectively, whilst, the same are reported to be 27 and 30 min, respective when cured at 60 C (Jo et al., 2014a). It indicates that the hydration of alumina silicate phases proceeds faster with the increase in curing temperature (Jo et al., 2014a).\nBy mechanical strength analysis, it reveals that ACM performs similarly as OPC performed (Jo et al., 2014a). In fact, the mechanical strength of mortar and concrete depends upon several factors such as mix design, nature of cement, and curing environment, etc. Similarly, the strength of ACM based concrete and mortar depends upon the same factors (Jo et al., 2014b). However, irrespective of the factors affecting the mechanical strength, the compressive strength of ACM based mortar and concrete is reported to be similar or better than that of the OPC based concrete and mortar (Jo et al., 2014a, 2014b). In fact (Jo et al., 2014b), reported several physical and mechanical properties of concrete fabricated using ACM. They reported that the ACM has the ability to control physical and mechanical performances of the concrete. The slump value of ACM based concrete increases gradually with the increase in fine aggregate content as well as the alkali activator content, respectively. The air void content (%) and the bleeding capacity decrease gradually with the increase in fine to coarse aggregate ratio, however, the reverse trend in these properties are observed for the ACM based concrete with the increase in alkali activator content. Based on the compressive and splitting tensile strength analyses, it is demonstrated that the ACM based concrete fabricated using the optimum amount of fine aggregate (516 kg/m3), coarse aggregate (804 kg/m3) and alkali activator content (440 kg/m3 alkali activator) possesses superior mechanical performance as compared to that of the OPC based concrete (Jo et al., 2014b). Additionally, it is it is assessed that chemically synthesized nano cement (ACM) is able to achieve 43 MPa compressive strength of concrete after 14 days curing instead of 28 days at an optimized amount of aggregates content as well as alkali activator content (Jo et al., 2014b). Apart from these (Jo et al., 2015b), reported that the ACM has\nthe ability to achieve strength-maturity at the early age of curing. In fact, they predicted the optimized curing time to achieve maturity of the ACM based concrete using the Weibull distribution model (Jo et al., 2015b, 2015c).\nSubsequently (Jo et al., 2015a, 2016, 2017), studied the performances and properties of ACM prepared by the hydrothermal method using calcium carbonate as a Ca ion precursor directly without calcination, including the use of nano-silica infused with hydrated alumina. Analysing the results, the average compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and modulus of elasticity of the ACM based concrete is found to be w33 MPa, 4.1 MPa and 19 GPa, respectively; whilst, the same is reported to be 20e40 MPa, 3e5 MPa, and 15e50 GPa, respectively, for reference concrete (RC) prepared using ordinary portland cement (OPC) (Jo et al., 2017). Based on the results, it is ascertained that the ACM based concrete possesses a similar characteristic to that of the RC fabricated using OPC.\n4.2.4.3.4 Mechanism The prime reason for setting, hardening, and achieving mechanical strength of ACM based concrete and mortar is the condensation reaction of alumina-silicate compounds of ACM in the presence of alkali activator, followed by the formation of calcium/(sodium) alumina-silicate hydrate (Jo et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2015a, 2017). Fig. 7.9 represents a plausible model for the hydration and hardening of ACM/nano cement based mortar/concrete (Jo et al., 2014a). It is reported earlier that ACM contains alumina-silicate compounds which have a lack\nof driving force to initiate the hydration reaction (Jo et al., 2014a). However, the addition of alkali activator supplies the driving force for allowing the hydration reaction of alumina-silicate compounds that in turn, leads to produce sodium and/ or calcium based alumino-silicate compounds such as sodalite, natrite, gismondine, calcium silicate hydrate gel, sodium alumino-silicate-hydrate gel, and calcium sodium alumina-silicate-hydrate gel (Mondal, 2008; Sathupunya et al., 2002). As it seems that the alkaline hydration of ACM produces the various alumino-silicate gel and crystalline compounds, therefore, these compounds may lead to developing the microstructure at the nano and microscale level of the hydrated ACM concrete and mortar system. Hence, it can be anticipated that the performance of ACM may be controlled by the dispersion of the crystalline component over the gel compounds that in turn, leads to filling of the capillary pores at the nano and microscale level and increasing the efficiency of the interfacial transition zone. Consequently, the strength of the hydrated ACM based concrete/mortar can be enhanced (Jo et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2015a, 2017).\n4.2.4.3.5 Advantages Based on the results and discussion made in this case study, the production of nano-scale ACM by the hydrothermal method using nano-silica infused with hydrated alumina is demonstrated to be very effective not only to control the properties and performance of the construction materials, but also to reduce CO2 emission and energy consumption associated with the construction purpose. In fact, production of ACM by hydrothermal method belongs to the bottom-up nanotechnology concept and the utilization of ACM in preparing concrete products is assumed to be the sustainable developments (Jo et al., 2014a, 2017). The hydrothermal synthesis of ACM avoids the high-temperature clinker production step. Hence, the method is expected to be less energy intensive as compared to that of the existing process (Jo et al., 2014a, 2017). Additionally, the cost for the production of ACM is reported to less as compared to that of the existing OPC. Table 7.3 represents the benefits of ACM in comparison with the existing cement production method (Jo et al., 2017).\nThough an adequate advancement in producing the nano-scale alternative cementitious material has been achieved; however, it is still under consideration of the lab scale developments and needs to answer several key information such as, repeatability of the results, advanced physical, chemical, and structure analysis, market assessment, supply chain analysis, cost analysis, carbon dioxide footprint analysis, and finally the development of the industrial protocol for implementing the technology."
