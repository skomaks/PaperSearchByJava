      "text" : "At present, with increasing awareness of consumers and their concerns about processed foods along with the rising number of complicated diseases such as various types of cancer, food bioactive compounds, nutraceuticals, and functional foods are attracting considerable attention (Augustin and Hemar, 2009; Jafari and McClements, 2017; Katouzian and Jafari, 2016). In fact, people are demanding food products with ingredients that can promote their health and protect their wellbeing besides just providing nutrients. In our modern lifestyle, it is not common to have access to many of these bioactive nutrients in a normal diet, so an alternative could be adding them to our daily food products. However, processing and environmental conditions such as high temperatures, light, oxygen, pH, presence of other ingredients within the matrix, etc., can have unfavorable effects on these valuable nutrients (Borel and Sabliov, 2014; Gharibzahedi and Jafari, 2017b). Another important issue is the bioavailability of nutraceuticals: the ratio of an ingested bioactive compound that is uptaken by our cells and can effectively provide health-promoting properties. Food bioactive ingredients and nutraceuticals should\nNanomaterials for Food Applications ISBN 978-0-12-814130-4, https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-814130-4.00003-8\n© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this context, nanoencapsulation has emerged as a possible strategy to protect food bioactive ingredients and to provide delivery systems for nutraceuticals (Assadpour et al., 2017).\nIn this chapter, after a brief overview of the main differences between nanoencapsulation and microencapsulation, different nanoencapsulation technologies applicable to food ingredients will be presented on a systematic classification. Then, the recent studies and developments on nanoencapsulation of different food bioactive ingredients will be discussed, including phenolic compounds and antioxidants, essential fatty acids and fish oil, minerals, natural food colors, flavors, natural antimicrobial agents and essential oils, and bioactive peptides and enzymes."

      "text" : "In general, micro-/nanoencapsulation processes consist of embedding bioactive ingredients within micro-/nanosized capsules to protect them against deteriorating environmental conditions such as high temperatures, oxygen, light, pH variations, undesired interactions with other compounds, etc. (Yada et al., 2014; Jafari, 2017a). Besides, micro-/nanoencapsulation may allow controlled or targeted delivery of the loaded bioactive components to the desired location and with an appropriate rate through engineered design of the capsules and correct selection of the wall materials. For these reasons, these processes have been extensively studied in different research areas including food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics, and recently in agrochemicals and fisheries, among others.\nIt is generally accepted that nanoencapsulation should result in carriers with a size below 1 mm (1000 nm), although according to some specific legislations, particularly in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic areas, their size should be lower than 100 nm to be considered as nanocapsules (Shin et al., 2015; Jafari, 2017b). But, what are the advantages of nanoencapsulation over traditional microencapsulation for food ingredients? The reality is that when the size of particles is reduced to the nanoscale, there is a dramatic increase in the surface-to-volume ratio, which provides many attractive and unique properties to the nanoparticles. For instance, by producing nanoscale emulsions, liposomes, protein particles, etc., more available active sites are exposed on the surface of these delivery systems, which would be very beneficial for their absorption through the mucus-adhering mechanism within the digestive system of the body (McClements, 2015; Esfanjani and Jafari, 2016; Katouzian et al., 2017). On the other hand, penetration of nanocapsules into the cells and through the membranes would be much easier compared to microcapsules. Moreover, this higher surface-to-volume ratio enhances\nthe interaction of nanocarriers with enzymes, microorganisms, and other target agents such as receptors in tissue cells, which again results in higher efficiency of nanocapsules (Faridi Esfanjani et al., 2018).\nProduction of bioactive-loaded nanocarriers is more complex than generating microcapsules, and more advanced and sophisticated technologies are needed for the preparation of nanodelivery systems (Rafiee et al., 2018). Also, characterization and analysis of nanoencapsulated ingredients requires the use of specialized, modern instruments (Livney, 2015; Jafari and Esfanjani, 2017)."

      "heading" : "3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF NANOENCAPSULATION TECHNIQUES",
      "text" : "Nanoencapsulation is an emerging field of research that has been the focus of many recent studies. Fig. 3.1 shows the trends of publications in this field from 2007 to 2018. It is necessary to mention that statistics for 2018 is still in progress and certainly it will increase by the end of this year. This figure clearly shows that the number of publications in nanoencapsulation had a 500% growth in the last 10 years.\nAccording to Jafari (2017a,b), we can classify nanoencapsulation technologies into five groups based on the main mechanism/ingredient used to make nanocapsules for the food industry. They include lipid-based techniques, nature-inspired techniques, specializedequipment techniques, biopolymer-based techniques, and other miscellaneous techniques as shown in Fig. 3.2. There could be some overlaps in this classification; for example, some biopolymers are applied in specialized equipment techniques, but this classification is based on the main mechanism of nanocapsule formation. Selection of an appropriate technology for the production of food bioactive-loaded nanocarriers depends on many factors such as desired release profile and delivery purposes, physicochemical properties of the final product, economic considerations, available equipment, technical knowledge, etc (Assadpour\nand Jafari, 2018). Detailed information about various nanocarriers applicable to food bioactive ingredients and nutraceuticals is provided in Table 3.1.\nIt is worth mentioning that nanocapsules are not necessarily spherical nanoparticles; different morphologies and structures of final nanocarriers can be achieved based on the applied materials/technologies, which are briefly outlined below: • Spherical nanocarriers:\nThey could be in the form of nanocapsule or nanosphere. Nanospheres can be defined as matrix systems utilized for the uniform dispersal of bioactive components, whereas nanocapsules are vesicular systems where bioactive compounds are encapsulated within a cavity consisting of an inner liquid core which in turn is surrounded by a polymeric membrane. Also, from a physical point of view, these nanocarriers can be “liquid” such as those prepared with nanoemulsions, nanoliposomes, biopolymer nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, and cyclodextrins (CDs), or “solid” such as nanoparticles made with nano spray dryer, electrospraying, and nanocrystals. • Tubular nanocarriers: They should have at least one dimension in the nanoscale (usually their cross sec-\ntion in nanosized) to be considered nanocarriers, although their length could be higher than 1000 nm. Within this group, we can include nanofibers (produced by electrospinning), nanotubes (from certain proteins such as a-lactalbumin), nanofibrils (for instance from b-lactoglobulin), and nanohelix structures (such as those from amylose). Bioactive components can be embedded within their hollow cavity."

      "text" : "Different categories of lipid-based nanocarriers have been reported and reviewed in the last decade for food bioactive ingredients (Katouzian et al., 2017). The main types that have been studied and developed in recent years include nanoemulsions, nanoliposomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, and solid lipid nanoparticles (Akhavan et al., 2018).\nConcerning nanoemulsions, there have been plenty of research efforts on their formulation, characterization and application in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. These nanocarriers can be applied for nanoencapsulation of hydrophilic or hydrophobic bioactive components in the form of simple nanoemulsions, multiple nanoemulsions, pickering nanoemulsions, nanoemulsion-filled gels, and so on (Jafari et al., 2017c). In simple nanoemulsions, the bioactive ingredient is entrapped within the dispersed phase that is itself stabilized through surfactants/biopolymers in the continuous phase (Jafari et al., 2015). In multiple nanoemulsions, first an initial simple nanoemulsion is fabricated with the core material loaded within its internal phase and in the next step, it will be dispersed in a second continuous phase so that there is one internal phase, one middle phase, and one external phase (Assadpour et al., 2016a; Esfanjani et al., 2015). If the core material is a hydrophilic ingredient, then it is necessary to prepare waterin-oil nanoemulsions or water-in-oil-in-water double nanoemulsions. Although for hydrophobic ingredients such as fat-soluble vitamins and carotenoids, it is essential to formulate oil-in-water nanoemulsions or oil-in-water-in-oil double nanoemulsions.\nIn general, nanoemulsions can be produced by low energy methods (including phase transition approaches) and high-energy methods (such as high-pressure homogenization and ultrasonication). Also, there are some other mechanical techniques for production of nanoemulsions, which do not need energy as much as high-energy methods; some of the well-known techniques in this group are membrane emulsification and microfluidics (Esfanjani et al., 2017; Mehrnia et al., 2017).\nRegarding nanoliposomes, they are applicable for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic food ingredients (Demirci et al., 2017). Liposomes have been studied for a long time and their nanosized version, i.e., “nanoliposomes”, has been introduced in recent years with the main difference being their size. Nanoliposomes are produced from phospholipids (mainly lecithin) through various techniques; the two main methods include: (1) thin layer hydration technique, which needs some cholesterol and conversion of the phospholipid solution into a thin layer through vacuum evaporation of the solvent; (2) noncholesterol technique, which eliminates usage of cholesterol by replacing it with solvents such as glycerol and heating in a water bath. After formation of the liposome structure, its size will be reduced to the nanoscale by applying high-energy devices such as ultrasonication (Ghorbanzade et al., 2017). The phospholipid vesicular nanocapsule can be single layered (unilamellar) or multilayered (multilamellar). In these nanocarriers, hydrophilic ingredients are entrapped within the polar cavity in the central part, and hydrophobic components can be encapsulated within the nonpolar layer at the peripheral of the resultant capsules. In recent years, there have been some studies on the stability improvement of nanoliposomes through application of an extra biopolymer layer (such as chitosan) on the external surface of liposomes, resulting in changes in the zeta potential of the prepared nanocarriers due to the inherent surface charges of these biopolymers (Demirci et al., 2017). Also, “nanophytosomes” are a new class of nanoliposomes that have been customized for entrapment of bioactive phytochemicals, particularly phenolic compounds (Esfanjani and Jafari, 2016). Although both of them have a similar structure, there are two main differences: (1) in phytosomes, there is 1:1 or 1:2 (phospholipid:bioactive) stoichiometry ratio, whereas in nanoliposomes this is much higher; (2) in nanoliposomes, the bioactive is entrapped physically, but in nanophytosomes, the bioactive will be bound chemically to the structure of the carrier, for example through hydrogen bonds, which makes it more stable.\nFinally, within this group, there is a new generation of nanocarriers that are generally called nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) (Katouzian et al., 2017). To control the release of bioactive ingredients and to give a better protection of the core material and reduce its leakage, scientists have developed solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). In fact, SLNs are similar to nanoemulsions, but the oil component in their dispersed phase is solidified (Pyo et al., 2017). This strategy allows reducing the leakage of the entrapped bioactive ingredient, enhancing its protection. But because of crystallization\nconsequences of the solid lipid, researchers have optimized this technology by replacing the solid phase with a mixture of solideliquid lipid, developing the so-called NLCs (Pyo et al., 2017). NLCs and SLNs are appropriate for hydrophobic ingredients including some vitamins and many drugs. Their preparation methods are similar to those employed for nanoemulsions, with some modifications. An important step is the melting of the solid lipid before addition of the core material, which then solidifies in the form of SLNs or NLCs when mixed with a liquid oil.\nIn Table 3.2, some examples of different food bioactive ingredients loaded within lipid-based nanocarriers are presented.\ningredients Examples of the bioactive Reference"

      "text" : "The idea of bioactives encapsulation using natural nanocarriers results from taking into account the nature-made functionalities of these nanoparticles (Esfanjani and Jafari, 2016). As an example, casein micelles can naturally encapsulate and transport vital nutrients through milk; amylose chains can bind a variety of flavor compounds developed during bread making, which can be released during subsequent heating, and starch derivatives (nanogranules and CDs) can form inclusion complexes with many nutraceuticals. Nature-inspired nanocarriers have received great attention for the delivery of nutrients and drugs because of their safety and low cost. The functional properties of naturally occurring nanovehicles are characterized by their biological source, isolation methods, or physical and biochemical alterations. These tiny natural nanoparticles such as caseins, CDs, amylose nanostructures, and starch granules are employed in the nanoencapsulation of bioactive food ingredients and nutraceuticals.\nCaseins are the major proteins of cow’s milk, accounting for 80% of its total protein content; caseins are found naturally in the form of spherical micelles with nanoparticles typically between 50 and 200 nm (Haratifar and Guri, 2017). Caseins have physicale chemical properties similar to copolymers with well-balanced hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions and can self-assemble to form nanosized carriers, with excellent thermal stability, offering enormous potential to be used as a natural carrier for bioactive food ingredients of hydrophobic or sensitive properties. In addition, the recent understanding of its physicochemical properties of each protein fractionation in casein micelle and the use of novel technologies have opened up new application opportunities. The way how caseins self-assemble into micelles due to hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions renders them very suitable for incorporation of hydrophobic active molecules (Esfanjani and Jafari, 2017). These protein assemblies are perfectly designed to transport all the essential nutrients from the mother to the offspring in the most precise way. Regarding the economical, nutritional, and safety issues, caseins have been proven to be one of the most reliable nanovehicles. All three types of caseins (as1, as2, and b-casein) have the ability to bind calcium, and calcium phosphate in their structure due to the presence of phosphate residues. Knowing this, researchers have looked at the possibility of utilizing caseins as carriers of other metal ions such as iron (Feþ2) and magnesium (Mgþ2) (Gharibzahedi and Jafari, 2017a). It is believed that the core of casein micelles provides an environment where nonpolar compounds could be accommodated for a safe delivery. Because of the structural and physicochemical characteristics and their ability for hydrophobic interactions, caseinates and b-caseins have been used to encapsulate different hydrophobic bioactive molecules such as hydrophobic vitamins, curcumin, fatty acids, etc.\nCyclodextrins are hollow molecular nanocarriers with certain sizes to encapsulate many different ingredients through the insertion of the appropriate ‘‘guest’’ structure\ninto their cavity (Gharibzahedi and Jafari, 2017). This cavity is less polar than water. The internal diameter of the water-insoluble cavity with a certain depth (0.78 nm) depends on the number of glucose units in a-, b-, and g-CDs, which is 0.57, 0.78, and 0.95 nm, respectively. Generally, the inclusion is formed by complexing one CD molecule and one guest molecule in a stoichiometry ratio of 1:1. However, it is possible in the design of CD complexes to include more than one guest with low and/or high molecular weights into the cavity (Gharibzahedi and Jafari, 2017). Starch, a widely available carbohydrate polymer, is the raw material for the industrial-scale production of CDs. These natural structures are formed through the transformation of starch by certain bacteria such as Bacillus macerans and Bacillus circulans through the CD-glycosyltransferase (CGTase) enzyme, which partially hydrolyzes starch into a-(C36H60O30), b-(C42H70O35), and g-(C45H80O40)eCDs. Modification of CDs not only can provide their safety, but also can keep the formation ability of inclusion complexes with different guest molecules (Asghari Ghajari et al., 2017). The modification usually converts natural CDs into their amorphous derivatives. Two primary chemical parameters including nucleophilicity of eOH groups and the production potential of complexes between CDs and applied reagents should be considered for their modification process. There are different methods involved in the complex formation between guest molecules and CDs such as dry mixing (physical blending), milling/cogrinding, kneading, coprecipitation, and so on (Gharibzahedi and Jafari, 2017a).\nIn terms of amylose nanocarriers, different bioactive ingredients as ligands can be nanoencapsulated within amylose nanostructures (Zabar et al., 2009). The presence of ligands induces a conformational change in amylose, namely the conversion of double helices into a unit strand (V-shaped amylose), which is dense and has a central hydrophobic cavity, capable of binding lipophilic molecules such as fatty acids via hydrophobic interactions (Cohen et al., 2008).\nSome examples of different food bioactive ingredients loaded within nature-inspired nanocarriers are presented in Table 3.3."

      "heading" : "3.3.3 Nanoencapsulation of Food Ingredients Through Specially Designed Equipment",
      "text" : "Many of the techniques that have been applied for nanoencapsulation of food ingredients rely on formulation knowledge and some well-known equipment such as rotorestator mixers, high-pressure homogenizers, ultrasonication devices, etc. But in the last few years, researchers throughout the world have developed specially designed equipment including nano spray dryer, electrospinning/spraying, and micro/nanofluidics for the direct production of nanoparticles and nanocarriers without any formulation background.\nBasically, an electrospinning assembly consists of three main elements (Ghorani et al., 2017), which are (1) a supply of high voltage, (2) a spinneret (typically made by\nrepurposing a blunt hypodermic syringe), and (3) a grounded collector. A high voltage direct current supply is used to induce a surplus electric charge in the liquid polymer (either a melt, or more commonly a solution or dispersion). A fiber strand is pulled out of the droplet that is accelerated toward the collector. The liquid polymer is either pumped from the spinneret at a constant volume flow using a syringe pump or more\ningredients Examples of the bioactive Reference\ntraditionally fed from a reservoir at constant head (Jafari, 2017a). The resulting electrospun nanofibers can be applied to deliver bioactive components along with the fiberforming polymer; these bioactives significantly influence the mechanical properties and functionality of the nanofibers. Electrospun nanofibers are monofilaments, and if the fiber is being solidified in flight, it results in a cross section of cylindrical shape. When applying electrospinning for preparation of nanofibers containing bioactive components, it is necessary to consider different parameters such as the polymer solution properties, process variables, and ambient conditions because they influence the nanofiber structure and bead formation (Ghorani et al., 2017).\nElectrospraying is fundamentally similar to electrospinning, as both techniques are based on the same physics governing the ejection of a continuous stream; however, if the degree of molecular cohesion is below a critical level, droplets are formed from the ejecta, instead of a continuous fiber (Tapia-Hern andez et al., 2017). The theory of electrospraying technique is based on the ability of an electric field to crush a droplet into nanosized particles depending on the control parameters. It has been shown that nanoparticles obtained from electrospraying can serve as nanocarriers of bioactive components. Therefore, the electrospraying technique is a feasible method for the entrapment of nutraceutical compounds and for nanoencapsulation purposes (Jafari, 2017a). To obtain desired nanoparticles, the parameters that influence the morphology of the particles during electrospraying should be carefully controlled. These parameters can be classified in three groups: equipment, solution, and environmental factors (Tapia-Hern andez et al., 2017).\nNano spray dryers have been introduced in the last few years to extend spray drying to the submicron scale (Arpagaus et al., 2018). Laboratory spray dryers are based on a fundamentally new concept of spray drying technology, involving the fabrication of submicron particles from a solution, nanoemulsion, or nanosuspension. To produce nanoscale particles via spray drying technology, some modifications on the experimental setup of traditional spray dryers have been necessary. A major constraint is the limited efficiency of separation and collection of submicron particles by cyclone separators. Typical cyclones are unable to collect particles below 2 mm (Arpagaus et al., 2017). In other words, submicron-sized particles cannot be collected using traditional spray dryers. The only feasible option for collection of nanoparticles is to use electrostatic particle collectors. Another limitation is the turbulent gas flow in the drying chamber, which results in particle depositions on the chamber wall. Furthermore, traditional atomizers do not allow the fine droplets being generated to reach submicron particle sizes. With the recent advances in nano spray dryer technology, particles <1 micron can now be generated, which have the potential to be applied as nanocarriers of food bioactive ingredients (Arpagaus et al., 2017).\nRecently microfluidics techniques are also being utilized in the manufacture of novel micro/nanocarrier systems. This modern technology allows greater control and\nimproved optimization for the encapsulation efficiency and release of bioactive ingredients (Comunian et al., 2014). A microfluidic device consists of coaxial assemblies of a series of rigid glass capillaries resistant to chemicals; their 3D geometry could be applied for the controlled production of different carriers including emulsions and multiple emulsions, liposomes, polymeric particles, etc. (Balbino et al., 2017). The microfluidics technology has been well studied in drug delivery, but its application for the encapsulation of food bioactive ingredients is still at the beginning (Ravanfar et al., 2018). Generally, microfluidics techniques work with very small volume of fluids (10 9e10 8 L) within channels with dimensions of 10e100 mm. It has been claimed that this technology has many advantages such as more thoughtful use of sample and other ingredients, possibility to carry out separations and detections with higher resolution and sensitivity, lower cost of the whole system, quicker analysis, possibility of developing in vitro studies, and small footprints for the analytical devices (Ran et al., 2017). Also, microfluidics have unique characteristics such as pico- to nanoliters of initial ingredients, nano- to microseconds of mixing, reaction and self-assembly, real-time monitoring/imaging, and direct scaleup. This technology has been mainly applied for the production of microparticles and microcapsules, but it is also possible to fabricate nanocarriers by this system such as polymeric nanoparticles (from chitosan, alginate, etc.), nanoliposomes, and hybrid nanoparticles (Ran et al., 2017). The recent version of this technology, so-called “nanofluidics” has been the focus of researchers in the last few years and its application in nanoencapsulation can be predicted in the coming years.\nIn Table 3.4, some examples of different food bioactive ingredients loaded within nanocarriers made with special equipment are presented."

      "text" : "Biopolymer-based nanoparticles are defined as submicron biopolymeric particles, which can be used for nanoencapsulation of bioactive compounds. Biopolymeric nanocarriers can be fabricated by individual biopolymers such as lactoferrin nanoparticles, starch nanoparticles, alginate nanohydrogels, and a-lactalbumin nanotubes, or by complexation of two biopolymers with different surface charges such as proteinepolysaccharide nanocomplexes (e.g., pectinewhey protein nanocarriers).\nSingle biopolymer nanocarriers can be fabricated by either single protein or carbohydrate biopolymers via desolvation and precipitation techniques, respectively (Sadeghi et al., 2017). Desolvation is defined as a self-sorting process with the minimum of Gibbs free energy for biopolymers such as proteins to prepare nanoparticles. Based on this theory, replacing some or all water molecules (solvent) around protein molecules with a desolvating agent (another solvent) will cause conformational changes in protein structure and its solubility decreases significantly; therefore, phase separation and precipitation of proteins will occur consequently. This makes them\nready to interact with each other and form nanoparticles (Sadeghi et al., 2017). Application of protein nanoparticles produced by desolvation method has been studied for various food ingredients and nutraceuticals such as curcumin, folic acid, carvacrol, resveratrol, retinoic acid, vitamin D3, date extract, and many drugs and other bioactive compounds. A similar technique to desolvation, named nanoprecipitation, has been developed for the fabrication of nanoparticles from other biopolymers including polysaccharides.\nNanogels are defined as nanoscale carriers structured by chemically or physically cross-linked biopolymer networks particles within a nanosized range (Abaee et al., 2017). They have good swelling ability in appropriate solvents. When the solvent utilized\ningredients Examples of the bioactive Reference\nis water, the term “hydrogels” is used (Mokhtari et al., 2017). Some biopolymers such as alginate, chitosan, whey proteins, and soy proteins are capable of forming nanogel carriers through appropriate cross-linking agents. Also, nanogels can be produced using different synthetic polymers such as polyvinylalcohol, polyethyleneoxide, polyethyleneimine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and poly-N-isopropylacrylamide mainly for drug delivery. Based on the stimuli responsiveness, nanogels are divided into two main subcategories (Abaee et al., 2017). If the swelling process of a nanogel occurs simply by absorbing water, they are called “nonresponsive nanogels”. In some cases, environmental changes such as pH, enzymes, ionic stresses, temperature, or magnetic fields may affect the swelling ability of nanogels and consequently their release behavior. Such nanogels are referred to as being “stimuli-responsive”.\nNanotubes demonstrate a characteristic tubular shape similar to the structure of an empty carbon nanotube. As an example relevant to food applications, it is noteworthy that when a-lactalbumin is hydrolyzed partially, it is transformed into self-assembled nanotubes under suitable conditions (Jafari, 2017a). Protease enzymes from Bacillus licheniformis have been found to partially hydrolyze a-lactalbumin molecules, which immediately form linear nanotubes on exposure to calcium ions. All of the major physicochemical characteristics of a-lactalbumin nanotubes render this component as a promising nanoencapsulation agent. Recently researchers have found that in addition to a-lactalbumin, some globular whey proteins such as b-lactoglobulin and bovine serum albumin also can be self-assembled into nanofibrillar structures at elevated temperatures and low pH values (Jafari, 2017b). These nanofibrils have a characteristic diameter of approx. 5 nm and range up to 15 mm in length.\nAs compared to single biopolymers, formation of biopolymer complexes offers different functional and promising properties due to the synergistic combination between the functional features of various biopolymers (Ghasemi et al., 2017, 2018). The application of biopolymers and their mixtures for designing advanced engineered delivery systems to entrap food bioactive components and to enable subsequent fortification of food products is a highly desirable and promising technique. Generally, physical entrapment and chemical complexation of bioactive molecules (particularly hydrophobic ones) are the main strategies applied in the development of supramolecular biopolymer-based carrier systems. Complexes and coacervates derived from proteinepolysaccharide interactions are ideal tools in nanoencapsulation technology (Hosseini et al., 2017). A large spectrum of different combinations of proteine polysaccharide applied for nanoencapsulation of different components can be seen in the literature. Among different structures resulted from proteinepolysaccharide complexation, the coacervates are superior to others for encapsulation technology.\nSome examples of different food bioactive ingredients loaded within biopolymer nanocarriers are presented in Table 3.5.\ningredients Examples of the bioactive Type of nanocarrier Reference\nN anoencapsulation:Techniques and D evelopm ents for Food A pplications\n51"

      "text" : "In addition to the abovementioned technologies, there are some other techniques that can be utilized for the formation of bioactive-loaded nanocarriers or nanoparticles including nanocrystals, dendrimers, niosomes, etc.\nBioactive ingredients that are prone to degradation due to environmental/processing conditions, e.g., pH, oxygen, light, temperature, can be loaded into nanocrystals; then these nanocarriers can be coated by a protective polymer layer. This is also applicable for nanocrystals of bioactives that are sensible to the different conditions in the GIT after ingestion, e.g., degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach (Romero et al., 2017). The coating of single nanocrystal is often a tedious and costly process. A smarter and more cost-effective solution is the encapsulation in larger units, which serve as “containers” for nanocrystalsdthe “container approach.” Such containers are typically pellets. These are useful, for example, to protect the nanocrystals until they are incorporated into the final composition of the product being produced or, in case of nutraceuticals, they can be loaded into, e.g., hard gelatin capsules. The nanocrystals are admixed to an aqueous extrusion mass and the pellets are coated with a polymer dissolving in specific conditions, e.g., acid pH of the stomach or more alkaline pH in the intestine (Romero et al., 2017). Nanocrystals can be produced by bottom-up methods (starting from the molecule and growing it to nanocrystals through precipitation) and top-down methods (by reducing the size of mm crystals to the nanoscale).\nRecently, researchers particularly in pharmaceutical fields have developed surfactant nanostructures such as niosomes, cubosomes, and hexosomes for encapsulation of different bioactive ingredients. Niosomes are a group of surfactant-based carriers that consist of an aqueous core surrounded by a layer of nonionic surfactants, resulting in a vesicular bilayer structure similar to liposomes (Basiri et al., 2017). Hydrophilic bioactive components can be encapsulated within the central aqueous core, and lipophilic ingredients and nutraceuticals can be entrapped within the enclosed membrane. For preparation of niosomes, some energy input (in the form of physical agitation, heat, or sonication) is needed (Kopermsub et al., 2011). Niosomes have found applications in different fields including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food. Biocompatible, foodgrade, and nontoxic surfactant should be applied for food-based niosomes through hydration of the amphiphilic surfactants in a colloidal dispersion that can nanoencapsulate both hydrophilic and lipophilic bioactive ingredients. It has been claimed that niosomes are superior to liposomes in terms of stability and costs (Pando et al., 2015).\nThe structure of dendrimers as a subgroup of chemical polymer nanostructures consists of three major parts that are core, branches, and surface moieties. Because of monodisperse and multivalent character of dendrimers, they can be used for drug or food bioactive compound nanodelivery (Jafari, 2017a). Synthesis of dendrimers requires the\nselection of a suitable initiator that can be transformed into the reactive core of the assembly, where repetitive reactions take place to generate new highly branched dendrimers. Each reaction results in the generation of a larger dendrimeric assembly.\nSome examples of miscellaneous nanocarriers applied for food bioactive ingredients are given in Table 3.5."

      "text" : "OF NANOENCAPSULATED FOOD COMPONENTS\nAlthough the fate of nanoformulations after consumption has been covered in more detail in Chapter 2 of the present book, given its relevance, the route of food bioactive-loaded nanocapsules within the GIT and their bioavailability are briefly mentioned here. Nanocarriers loaded with different food bioactive ingredients and nutraceuticals move through various regions of our GIT and some changes happen in their properties when they pass through mouth, stomach, small intestine, and colon before release of their cargos (Jafari et al., 2017a). Metabolic enzymes such as amylase, protease, and lipase, acids, ions, bile salts, etc., are secreted within our GIT, which certainly will have an impact on these nanocarriers. It is important that nutraceuticals and bioactive ingredients loaded within nanocarriers should be intact in small intestine as it is considered the main site for absorption of these valuable ingredients, particularly the lipophilic components that should be solubilized, transported, and absorbed here through mixed micelle formation mechanisms (Jafari andMcClements, 2017). Those undigested ingredients in small intestine such as fibers move into colon and will be metabolized there with the help of residing bacteria.\nIn small intestine, bioactive ingredients and nutraceuticals first should diffuse through the intestinal mucus layer and reach the endothelia cells by two main routes: paracellular and transcellular (Jafari et al., 2017b). After passing through the GIT barrier, nutraceuticals and bioactive components move into the blood circulation and here they could be distributed within the whole body; therefore, they will reach all cells and organs for implementing their health-promoting roles. But another significant point is successful cellular uptake of nutraceuticals, i.e., they should pass through the cell walls too. Within the cells, there are complicated and various mechanisms for absorbed nutraceuticals, which could result in favorable functions for improving our health (Katouzian and Jafari, 2016).\nA schematic representation of GIT fate of nutraceuticals is presented in Fig. 3.4."

      "text" : "A broad range of nanoencapsulation systems have been developed, although most of them have only been produced at lab-scale, and only a very few made it to the market.\nSelection of a nanoencapsulation technology depends on several factors, such as physicochemical features, required particle size, release properties, delivery method, process cost, and so on. Although there are many different nanoencapsulation technologies applied in the literature, a few of them can be utilized in the food industry because of regulatory and economic issues. One major gap on applying nanoencapsulation technologies for the food products is research activities and studies on quality and safety improvement of food products rather than nutraceutical delivery. In fact, encapsulation experts in the food industry should focus on improving the shelf life and quality of food products by nanoencapsulated bioactive ingredients. For example, delaying the oxidation of oils and fats, improving the organoleptic properties of foods, replacing synthetic preservatives by natural encapsulated antimicrobials, etc."
