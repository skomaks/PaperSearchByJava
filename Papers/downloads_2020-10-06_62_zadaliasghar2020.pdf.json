It is based on the inhibitory effect of phenobarbital on melamine induced aggregation of sodium dodecyl sulfate modified silver nanoparticles. The interaction ofmelamine andphenobarbital results in thedisaggregation of nanoparticles and consequently increase the absorbance intensity proportional to phenobarbital concentration, and color change from purple to yellow. A central composite design as a multivariate optimization approach with four independent parameters (i.e. pH,melamine concentration, nanoparticle concentration and time)was employed to optimize the reaction conditions. In the optimized conditions, the presentedmethodwas fully validated by investigation of system linearity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, and selectivity. The validatedmethodwas used for the determination of phenobarbital in plasma samples collected from patients receiving phenobarbital.\n© 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

      "text" : "Phenobarbital (5-ethyl-5-phenylbarbituric acid, pKa of 7.63 and a partition coefficient, pKo/w, of 1.47) is a medication prescribed for treatment of anxiety, seizures and insomnia [1]. Hypnosis and sedation are reported as important side effects for phenobarbital. Some overdose symptoms including drowsiness, decreased urination, shallow breathing, and fainting spells can also be reported for this drug [2]. Therefore, in the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics studies of phenobarbital in the biological fluids of patients, the development of a simple and reliable method can be considered as an important issue in clinical applications. So far, numerous analytical techniques have been reported for phenobarbital determination in the biological samples such as gas chromatography–mass spectrometry [3], liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry [4], high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector [5], microchip electrophoresis with laser-induced\nesearch Center and Faculty of 165665811, Iran. ur).\nfluorescence detection [6], voltammetry [7], and spectrofluorimetry based on molecularly imprinted polymers [8]. Although chromatographic methods exhibit high accuracy and precision for drug determination in the biological samples, the development of an easy-to-use method for quantification of drugs' concentration in the biological fluids has always been of interest for clinicians. For this purpose, increasing attention has been attracted towards sensors based on nanomaterials [9]. Nanomaterials with unique optical properties that arise due to their small size effect can offer significant advantages for sensing [10]. Plasmonic nanostructures such as silver and gold nanoparticles (NPs) are nanomaterials with widespread application in various fields due to their special optical properties arises from the collective oscillations of free electrons in response to incident light [11]. Plasmonic property of noble metal NPs can be employed for bio-diagnostics and biomedical studies.\nIn the current research, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) modified Ag NPs were synthesized and used for developing a nano-platform for determination of phenobarbital in the biological samples. Melamine can affect the stability of SDS-modified Ag NPs and results in their aggregation. However, in the presence of phenobarbital, melamine can react\nwith it and disaggregation of NPs is observed. The inhibitory effect of phenobarbital on the aggregation of Ag NPs/melamine system is proportional to its concentration. To obtain maximum signal intensity for the developednano-platform, the experimental parameterswere investigated by central composite design (CCD) as response surface methodology (RSM) instead of conventional “one at a time” method. One at a time method for optimization of process parameters requires large number of experiments, which may be quite expensive and timeconsuming. These limitations can be resolved by experimental andmultivariable optimization [12–15]. RSM was introduced by Box and. Wilson in 1951. The main idea of RSM is to use a sequence of designed experiments to obtain an optimal response. RSM is extensively used to reduce the number of experiments, to investigate the interactions between variables and to find the optimal condition via shorter cycles and higher accuracy [16]. This method uses mathematical computation and presents an equation for the dependency of the response signal to reaction parameters."

Fig. 1A and B show that the SDS-modified Ag NPs have a spherical morphology with a mean dimension of ≈16 nm (Fig. 1C).\nXRD analysis was used to determine the crystalline phases of the synthesized NPs and its pattern is presented in Fig. 1D. Three specified peaks at 38.3°, 44.5° and 64.8°, respectively, attributed to (111), (200) and (220) planes. By comparing JCPDS (file no: 89-3722), the typical pattern of synthesized Ag NPs is found to possess the FCC structure [18].\nIn order to identify the surface nature of the synthesized NPs, FT-IR was provided and given in Fig. 1E. The peaks for C\\\\H bonds of SDS were observed at 2922 and 2852 cm−1. The characteristic peaks at 989–1075 cm−1 and 824 cm−1 is attributed to symmetric and antisymmetric stretching bonds of the SO4 part of SDS and the bending vibration of the S-O-C segment of SDS which demonstrate that Ag NPs has been well modified with SDS [19]. Moreover, the successful synthesis of the SDS-modified Ag NPs was further verified by the chemical composition analyzed by EDX. As can be seen in Fig. 1F, it is demonstrated to illustrate the distribution of silver, sodium, oxygen, sulfur and carbon elements."

      "text" : "Ag NPs as plasmonic NPs exhibit well characteristic spectrum in the visible region. Because their electron density can couple with electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths and induce the electrons oscillation or the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) phenomenon. LSPR spectrum for SDS-modified Ag NPs with spherical morphology is observed at 400 nm (Fig. 2a). In the preliminary tests, no interaction was observed between SDS-modified Ag NPs and phenobarbital (Fig. 2b).\nAccording to the literature [20], melamine can induce aggregation of Ag NPs, and cause to changes in both the absorbance peak of the NPs and in the solution color (from yellow to bold purple) (Fig. 2c). On the other hand, it is reported that the melamine can react with barbital at pH = 5.5 [21] and the next investigations show that phenobarbital can also have an interaction with melamine due to the structural similarity (Fig. 2d). Thus, it can be said that phenobarbital served as an inhibitor for aggregation of SDS-modified Ag NPs in the presence of melamine and results in regeneration of LSPR peak of Ag NPs. Fig. 3 show that this regeneration and increase in absorption at 400nm is proportional to phenobarbital concentration in the range of 1–50 μg∙mL−1.\n3.3. Optimization of reaction parameters by CCD\nRSM was used to investigate the effect of reaction factors affecting the phenobarbital analysis including reagents concentrations, pH, and reaction time. A CCD with four independent parameters was employed to optimize the reaction conditions. Each of the investigated parameters was assessed at five coded levels (−α,−1, 0, +1, and+α). The related data and figures are summarized in electronic supporting material (ESM). To see the effect of each variable and also analyze the variation of the response surfaces, the three dimensional graphs were plotted and are given in Fig. 1S. In Fig. 1Sa, the response surfacewas constructed\nas a function of pH and melamine concentration by holding other parameters at the center level. As can be seen in Fig. 1S, the analytical response decreases with an increase in the pH and the response reaches maximumwhen pH is acidic. It coincides to the literature which reports melamine and barbital interact at pH = 5.5. Also, the maximum response in signal intensity was obtained as the melamine concentration raised to 40 mg.L−1 and reach a plateau after that concentration which verifies the involvement of all NPs in the aggregation process. Fig. 1Sb shows the response surface of absorbance intensity as a function of the melamine concentration and Ag NPs volume and confirms 40 mg. L−1 as optimum value for melamine. The optimum volume for Ag NPs to reach amaximum responsewas obtained to be 60 μL. The absorbance intensity increases with an increase in time and devastatedwith time as the samples stand more than 5 min (Fig. 1Sc). So maximum 5 min was selected for the next experiments. The optimum values of each selected parameter are: pH 5.0, [melamine] = 40 mg∙L−1, Ag NPs volume =\n60 μL, and time = 5 min. The trained equation in uncoded units can be written as:\nY ¼ 0:631−0:2135 X1 þ 0:01471 X3−0:0337 X4 þ 0:01534 X12−0:002256 X1 X3 þ 0:00847 X1 X4 ð1Þ\nIn which X1, X2, X3 and X4 are pH,melamine concentration, NPs concentration and time, respectively. As can be seen, pH is an important factor with the maximum impact factor and melamine concentration is a less important variable which is omitted from the equation. The variableswith a negative effect, positive effect, and any interaction between investigated parameters along with their impact factors on the analytical signals are clearly understood from themodel and the response surface reported in Fig. 1S."

      "text" : "Patients may take some co-administered and non-prescribed drugs such as over-the-counter drugs. To study the selectivity of the developed method toward phenobarbital, the effects of the various drugs on the phenobarbital determination by the developed nano-platform was studied. For this purpose, sample solutions containing a fixed concentration of phenobarbital (20 μg.mL−1) and various concentration of the interfering drug were analyzed and the obtained tolerance limit for each interfering drugwas listed in Table 1. As can be seen, the developed nano-platform has good selectivity for phenobarbital analysis except in the presence of oxazepam, alprazolam and lovastatin. The interfering concentration for the mentioned drugs is about 20 μg. mL−1. However, it should be noted that the therapeutic level for oxazepam, alprazolam and lovastatin was reported to be 0.2–1.5 μg∙mL−1, 0.005–0.05 μg∙mL−1 [22], and 9.5 ng∙mL−1 (mean value) [23] which is much lower than concentration obtained as the tolerance limit. These results demonstrate that the current nano-platform has good selectivity for phenobarbital analysis.\n3.5. Analytical figures of merit\nIn the optimized reaction conditions, a linear calibration graph was constructed for phenobarbital concentration against absorbance intensity (λ400) in the range of 1–50 μg∙mL−1 (Fig. 3) with a correlation coefficient of 0.998. The regression equation was ΔA= 0.0049 C. + 0.0277, whereΔA is the response intensity in an arbitrary unit, and C. is the concentration of phenobarbital in μg∙mL−1. The limit of detection (LOD), defined as 3 Sb/m (in which Sb is the standard deviation of the blank and m is the slope of the calibration curve), for the developed method was 0.6 μg∙mL−1. The method precision was investigated by repeated determination of phenobarbital in a known concentration on the same day and on different days. The intra-day and inter-day (n = 5) relative standard deviations (%RSD) for determination of 20 μg∙mL−1 phenobarbital are 4.3% and 5.2%, respectively.

The LOD and linear range of the developed nanoprobe are comparable with that of other published techniques [3–7]. Moreover, the developed method is rapid and simple and has good performance for the quantification of phenobarbital by considering this fact that the therapeutic plasma level of phenobarbital is 10–40 μg∙mL−1 [22]."

The Ag NPs-based method was employed for the phenobarbital analysis in plasma of the patients receiving phenobarbital and the obtained concentration range was reported to be 9.59–30.12 μg∙mL−1. Selective interaction between melamine and barbital at optimum conditions gives a proper selectivity to phenobarbital analysis by the developedmethod. Furthermore, the high sensitivity and fast response time of the validated method havemade it a promisingmethod for phenobarbital determination in the biological samples. Despite these advantages, the presented method has an important problem that could limit its applicability for routine clinical use and it is the poor long-term storage stability of these nanoparticles.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nSamira Zadaliasghar: Methodology.
