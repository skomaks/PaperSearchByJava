The combined effects of the two environmental stressors on the anti-predation ability of marine mussels were studied. Mytilus coruscus was exposed to three different gradient concentrations of nano-ZnO (0, 2.5, 10mg/L) in combination of two pH levels (7.7 and 8.1). The crab Charybdis japonica was used as its predator. During the experiment, anti-predator indexes, including number of byssus threads (NBT), shell-closing strength (SCS), diameter of byssus thread (BTD), length of byssus thread (BTL), cumulative length of byssus thread (CBTL) and cumulative volume of byssus thread (CBTV) were studied. The results showed that predator induced the anti-predation responses in M. coruscus, and NBT, SCS, BTL, CBTL and CBTV were significantly increased. Under the conditions of pH 7.7 and 10mg/L nano-ZnO, NBT, SCS, BTD, BTL, CBTL, and CBTV were significantly reduced. What's more, significant interactions among pH, nano-ZnO and predator were observed in CBTL and CBTV. Therefore, the joint treatment of nano-ZnO and low pH reduces the adhesion strength of byssus thread and may increase the probability of mussels being preyed.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.02.072 Received 14 November 2018; Received in revised form 2 February 2019; Accepted 20 February 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author at: National Demonstration Center for Experimental Fisheries Science Education, Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai, China.

      "text" : "The rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) resulting from human fossil fuel combustion reduces the pH of the ocean, leading to ocean acidification (OA) [1]. At present, the pH of the ocean has been reduced by 0.1 units compared to the time before the industrial revolution, and it is expected to reduce 0.3 to 0.5 units by the end of the 21 st century [2]. Some evidences have shown that marine animals are in the midst of the huge impact of OA [3]. There are lots of studies have confirmed that OA affects physiological activity [4–6], immune function [7] and interspecies interaction [8] in bivalves. The increasingly harsh seawater environment has brought unprecedented difficulties to the diversity of marine ecosystems and the protection of species. The survival of marine organisms, especially marine invertebrates, is in the midst of a huge threat of OA.\nNanoparticles refer to particles with at least one dimension on the three-dimensional scale in the order of nanometers (1˜100 nm) [9,10]. It is a type of artificial material that can exist in nature in a single particle or aggregate state. Its unique physical properties make it a wide application in optoelectronic devices, solar cells, 2D materials, environmental protections and biomedical applications [11–14]. Some studies showed that combined mixtures of nanoparticles are less toxic in comparison to individual mixtures [15], and ZnO nanoparticles with different forms or under various environmental conditions exert different toxicity to organisms [16]. Similarly, studies have shown the adverse effects of nanomaterials on aquatic animals, in addition to their own toxic effects on organisms, nanomaterials also show interactive effects with other pollutants [17,18]. Along with the rapid development of nanoscience and technology, the biological effects and safety of nanomaterials have attracted great attention all over the world. However, the toxic effects and mechanisms of nanomaterials on aquatic organisms are still not comprehensive. Marine mussels as filter-feeding organisms inevitably consume nanoparticles [19]. Compared with freesuspended nanoparticles, mussels are more likely to incorporate and take up agglomerated nanoparticles [20]. When nanoparticles enter different tissues and cells of mussels, they accumulate in specific tissues and organs. For example, nano silver particles can enter the blood cells of the mussel Mytilus edulis [21], and C60 fullerene can agglomerate in digestive gland tissue and cells of the oyster Crassostrea virginica [22]. The state of nanoparticles in water can be affected by various environmental factors, such as pH, ionic strength, and adsorption of humic acid [23]. For example, the properties of nanoparticles can be altered by low pH in seawater, resulting in greater aggregation [24]. In previous studies, under low pH, ZnO nanoparticles can accumulate and form large agglomerates, possibly allowing the mussels to consume more nanoparticles [25]. Acidified water can impair the dissolution rate of nanoparticles [24,26], and due to the feeding characteristics of mussels, nanoparticles may be ingested more easily by mussels when forming larger agglomerates [20]. Therefore, under acidification conditions, mussels may ingest more nanoparticles. Once ingested, the nanoparticles are not easily discharged in the body, leading to more serious toxic effects, which in turn may have a negative impact on their anti-predation behavior.\nPredation affects behavior, physiology, and even population characteristics of prey, which is an important ecological factor [27–29]. In order to reduce the risk of predation, preys can produce multiple reactions when they face predators [30,31]. It is generally believed that the cost of increased anti-predator response will translate into a reduction in reproductive yield or long-term survival [29]. Therefore, when predatory signal is present, prey organism detects the predation risk and displays an inducible anti-predator defense, which allows prey to decrease the risk of injury or death while accurately defining and simulating a combination of costs and benefits that are good for defense [32]. Aquatic animals assess predation risk from the surrounding environment by detecting chemical signals. These chemical signals may be released by predator [33], or by prey that is preyed [34]. In the case\nof mussels, Perna viridis and M. edulis secrete more byssus threads in the presence of predators [35,36]. The byssus threads allow the mussels to securely attach to the substrate. In order to improve the anti-predation capacity, mussels enhanced adhesion strength by increasing the production of byssus threads [37]. The tensile stress is related to the length, and as the length of byssus thread increases, it requires a greater pulling force to break the threads [38].\nThe thick shell mussels (Mytilus coruscus) are mainly distributed along the coast of East China Sea. The Zhoushan Island has the largest mussel resources which contribute ecological and economic values very high for marine diversity and aquaculture. As a typical filter-feeding organism, mussel is a key species with a long life history in coastal ecosystem, and highly resistant to pollutants, these characteristics make mussel become a widely used indicator organism for monitoring the pollution of the marine environment [39,40]. The thick shell mussel is an important organism for studying ocean acidification and nanoparticle toxicity, and is of great significance in ecology and marine environmental science [40]. At present, these mussels may experience acidification condition in summer, and there are a large amount of nanoparticle pollutants in the Yangtze River estuary [41]. These two factors may have harmful impacts on the physiology and behavior of mussels, and subsequently mussels may be more vuneralble to its main predator, i.e., crabs [42]. In this experiment, the effects of nano-ZnO particles on the anti-predation ability of M. coruscus under seawater acidifications were investigated by measuring the anti-predation performance indexes, including the number of byssus threads (NBT), shellclosing strength (SCS), diameter of byssus thread (BTD), length of byssus thread (BTL), cumulative length of byssus thread (CBTL) and cumulative volume of byssus thread (CBTV)."

      "text" : "The thick shell mussels M. coruscus (shell length 5.20 ± 0.50 cm) and the crabs Charybdis japonica (carapace width 7.50 ± 0.50 cm) were collected from an island in Shengsi county, Zhejiang Province, China. The byssus threads of mussels were cut down to separate them. Then each mussel/crab was gently washed to remove the surface dirt and parasites, and adapted under laboratory conditions for a week. Mussels were held in fiber-glass tanks (500 L) with a circulating seawater system and air pumping. They were fed daily with the Isochrysis galbana (2.5× 104 cells/mL). Individual male crab was kept in a tank (10 L) with a circulating seawater system and air pumping. They were fed with live mussels every day. Crabs that didn’t eat mussels during acclimation were not used for experiments. Throughout the acclimation, seawater temperature was maintained at 20℃, pH was maintained at 8.1, and salinity was kept at 25 psu, which mimicked the conditions of natural environment in the Shengsi island where the mussels were collected."

      "text" : "An aquarium (30 L) was divided into two parts for water exchange by nylon mesh. Ten mussels were individually placed in a plastic container (100mL) with rows of holes and then immersed in one compartment. One male crab starved for two days was placed in the other compartment, exposing the mussels to an environment where they were able to detect the predator but avoiding predation. The experiment contained three different environmental/biological factors: two pH levels (pH 7.7 as the condition of acidic seawater; pH 8.1 is the environmental pH level), different concentrations of nano-ZnO levels (0 as control, 2.5 mg /L as moderate concentration and 10mg /L as high concentration respectively), and the presence and absence of predators (crab and no crab). Thus, there were totally 12 experimental treatments, the experiment was lasted for three days and repeated for three\ntimes. The CO2 gas used in the experiment was provided by Shanghai lidan industrial gas co., and nano-ZnO powder (99.9% purity) was made into 10 g nano-ZnO/L stock solution for preservation. Medusa thermodynamic analysis software was used to simulate the chemical formation of ZnO at a thermodynamic equilibrium of pH 1–14, and drew a Fraction diagram of the component distribution (Fig. 1). Primary particle size and morphology of nano-ZnO were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi JSM-7500 F) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Low Voltage Tem5, LVEM5) equipped with a CCD camera. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) of nanoZnO was tested by X'Pert PRO X-ray Diffractometer [47]. In addition, the particle size and zeta potential of nano-ZnO in different treatments were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a ZetaSizer Nano ZEN3600 in our previous study [47]. According to the calculation of the volume of seawater in the tank, the concentration of nanoparticles was made to reach the experimental concentrations. pH was controlled by the pH and pCO2 control system developed by Loligo® System company. The pH of the water in the experiment was achieved by intelligently controlling the flow rate of CO2 [25]. In the experiment, the water chemical parameters of experimental seawater were measured daily. Salinity was measured by YSI (model 5200 A, USA) and total alkalinity was measured by titration [51]."

In the experiment, NBT was defined as the amount of effective adhesion when they were attached to the substrate. NBT was observed by cut all the byssus threads from byssus orifice. Furthermore, BTD was measured by an anatomic microscope (Nikon, 0.01mm accuracy) with eyepiece micrometer; BTL was measured by vernier caliper (0.1mm accuracy);\nassuming that the byssus thread is cylinder, the volume of the byssus thread was computed from BTL and BTD (πr2L); SCS was measured by a force components (model: LH-Y01-20-4M), the shell was opened to a certain extent by shell opening device, and a sensor was used to complete the measurement. In addition, CBTL was calculated by multiplying NBT and the average BTL, CBTV was calculated by multiplying the number of byssus thread and the average volume of byssus thread."

      "text" : "According to the simulation results of the Medusa program, a few of ZnO particles can form into Zn2+ and ZnOH− at pH 7.7 (Fig. 1). According to the morphological observation by both SEM and TEM, the typical spheroid irregular shapes and particle diameters of 15–25 nm were confirmed, respectively (Fig. 2). Through the pH and pCO2 control system, the pH of each treatment was stably maintained within the range required by the study. Salinity and temperature were maintained at about 25 psu and 20 °C during the whole experiment. In addition, the seawater chemical parameters of each experimental group were showed in the Table1.\nMultivariate analysis of variance showed that pH, nano-ZnO and predator significantly affected the NBT, but there were no significant interaction among them (Table 2). NBT increased over time, and the predator-exposed mussels produced more NBT than the control group (Fig. 3). Throughout the experiment, NBT was reduced significantly under low pH after predator-exposed treatment (Fig. 3a). NBT was significantly reduced by high concentration of nano-ZnO from 12 h to the end of the experiment, but increased under pH 8.1 at the beginning, and pH 7.7 at 8 h (Fig. 3a). Low pH reduced NBT significantly at 24 h, 72 h for the non-predator group. Similarly, High concentration nanoZnO significantly decreased NBT from 8 h to 72 h under pH 8.1, and from 24 h to 72 h under pH 7.7 (Fig. 3b).\npH, nano-ZnO and predator significantly affected the SCS under all experimental conditions, and a significant interaction between pH and nano-ZnO was observed (Table 2). Compared with the control treatment, the SCS in the predator-exposed treatment showed an increasing tendency, but there was no statistical difference. Regardless of the predator exposure, the SCS of mussels was significantly reduced under the high concentrations of nano-ZnO. For the pH effect in the predatorexposed treatment, low pH significantly reduced SCS under nano-ZnO 2.5mg/L. Furthermore, SCS was significantly reduced under high concentrations of nano-ZnO for the control group, and SCS was also significantly reduced under low pH in the presence of nano-ZnO (Fig. 4).\npH, nano-ZnO and predator significantly affected the BTD, but no\ninteractions among pH, nano-ZnO and predator were observed (Table 2). The BTD was increased in the presence of crab. For the predator-exposed group, with the concentration of nano-ZnO increased, the BTD was significantly reduced. However, pH did not significantly affect BTD. For the control group, nano-ZnO also significantly impaired BTD. Unlike the predator-exposed treatment, low pH significantly reduced BTD under nano-ZnO exposure conditions (Fig. 5).\npH, nano-ZnO and predator significantly affected byssus thread length (BTL), and an interaction between pH and predator was observed. High concentrations of nano-ZnO significantly reduced BTL for all treatments. When the predator was present, the BTL was significantly reduced under low pH at concentrations of 0 and 2.5mg/L of nano-ZnO (Fig. 6). BTL was significantly increased in the presence of predators compared to the control group. pH, nano-ZnO and predator affected cumulative byssus thread length (CBTL) significantly, and all significant interactions were observed among them (Table 2). With the different BTL, CBTL was not only significantly reduced by high concentrations of nano-ZnO, but also the low pH (Fig. 7).\npH, nano-ZnO and predator significantly affected cumulative byssus thread volume (CBTV), and all significant interactions among them were observed (Table 2). For the predator-exposed and the control treatments, CBTV was significantly reduced under high concentration of nano-ZnO regardless of normal pH or low pH. Similarly, low pH significantly reduced CBTV for nano-ZnO exposure group (Fig. 8).\nAccording to principal component analysis (PCA), the total variance\nof 96.07% was expressed by two principal components (Fig. 9). Among them, 90.54 of the total variance was accounted by PC1, which separate zero and high concentration of nano-ZnO, most of which had higher levels of anti-predation responses, especially the CBTL and CBTV related to NBT. PC2 representing 5.53% of total variance, differentiated non-predator from predator-exposed mussels, showing that high BTD, BTL, and SCS were correlated to predator treatments."

      "heading" : "4. Discussion",
      "text" : "Marine mussels usually secrete byssus thread to fix themselves on the substrate to counter the impact of waves or predators. In addition, the secretion of byssus thread is a recognised anti-predator behavior for\nmussels. Predators in the hunting process first need to peel off the mussels from the attachments [42], so the performance of byssus thread plays an important role in the anti-predation of bivalve molluscs [43]. Our experimental results confirmed that the secretion of byssus thread was enhanced when mussels were exposed to crabs, indicating that the presence of predator has a significant inductive effect on the production of byssus threads. On the other hand, the enhancement of the ability of mussels to secrete byssus thread increases the resistance to the predation of crabs. Similarly, the byssus thread productions of the mussels Brachidontes variabilis [44], P. viridis [35,45,46], and M. coruscus [43] were increased significantly when their predators were present. In this study, the number of secreted byssus threads was reduced significantly under pH 7.7 and high doses of nano-ZnO. In our previous research, the physiological activity of mussel was reduced by low pH and nano-ZnO [47], indicating that these environmental stress factors reduce the\nenergy distribution of the mussel-secreted byssus thread, thereby increasing the risk of predation.\nThe shell-closing strength can be used as an ideal indicator to evaluate the health of bivalves, for example, SCS is an efficient indicator of health of pearl oysters, and is useful for bivalve breeding and culture [48]. It is well known that healthy mussels usually keep their valves tightly closed to resist predators and waves, so the SCS of mussels can reflect its defensive properties. In this study, acidification and high doses of nano-ZnO reduced SCS significantly, although the SCS of predator-exposed mussels increased compared with the control group, no significant effect was found. Since acidification and nanoparticles can result in the expenditure of energy reserves for metabolism in bivalves [49], the distribution of energy for maintaining normal physiological activity of the mussels, i.e., the SCS may be reduced.\nAccording to this study, under low pH conditions the number of byssus thread produced by the thick shell mussel was reduced\nsignificantly, and the secreted byssus thread was thinner than that under the normal pH. Previous studies have shown that acidification has the potential to drive fiber weakening by altering certain aspects of mussel physiology [50]. In previous studies, low pH significantly reduced the byssus function ofM. coruscus [43,51]. In this experiment, we found that pH had no significant effect on the BTD in the predator exposed treatment, while in the control group, under high doses of nano-ZnO, acidification significantly reduced the diameter of byssus thread. This indicates that under acidified stress, mussels distribute more energy to resist the predation of crabs. When the effects of predators are eliminated, mussels will allocate more energy to resist acidification and nanoparticle stress and thus resulting in impaired byssus.\npH, nano-ZnO and predator had significant effects on BTL and NBT of M. coruscus, so subsequent CBTL was also significantly affected by these factors. Mussels utilize all of the byssus thread as a whole to resist predation from predators [43], so fewer NBT, thinner BTD, and shorter BTL may increase the risk of mussels being preyed by their predators. However, under the stress of adverse environment such as acidification and nanoparticles, the predation risk may not be increased, because the predator's ability to adapt to environmental stress needs to be considered. If predator can not adapt to the same environmental pressure, then the risk of predation of mussels will not exist, but if the prey can’t adapt to the stressful environment, it would be easily preyed. Previous studies have shown that aquatic predators showed lower capture efficiency when they were exposed to stressful conditions [52–54]. In contrast, some reports suggested that predators can gain predation advantages in a stressful environment [55,56]. Kroeker et al. (2014) pointed out that environmental changes may affect a series of reactions between prey and their predators [50], and the results of predator-prey interactions need further exploration.\nCBTV was increased by 107% in the presence of predators compared with the control group. From the molecular level, acidification may alter the performance of the byssus thread by affecting the up- or downregulation of certain genes [51]. A previous study has demonstrated that the down-regulation of some specific byssus thread proteins may be one of the reasons for the weakened mechanical properties of individual byssus thread under ocean acidification conditions [57]. There are few reports explaining the effect of nanoparticles on the byssus thread. We speculate that the mussels may adsorb or embed the\nnanoparticles from the water environment into the byssus thread during the process of secreting byssus, thus affecting the performance of byssus thread. In terms of energy distribution, our previous research found that low pH [5,58] and high concentration of nanoparticles [47,59] reduce the physiological energy of M. coruscus. Mussels distribute energy in physiological activity, defense, growth and reproduction, and the energy costs of acid-base regulation [60] and calcification [61, 62] can be affected by environmental stress. Affected mussels may display complex and distinct energy distribution patterns that may affect growth and defense, including changes in a series of physiological processes and behaviors [50], which may subsequently affect predator-prey interactions. In this study, anti-predation behaviors of mussels were impaired over time under low pH and high concentrations of nanoparticles, which means an increase in energy allocation to adapt to stressful environment. However, they still increased the byssus production when the predator was present, highlighting the survival requirements of mussels under stress conditions."
