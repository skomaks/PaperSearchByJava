      "text" : "As we known, when skin is injured, bacteria will soon penetrate into the subcutaneous tissue, and cause skin infection and may also cause life-threatening problems. Therefore, using dressings with good antibacterial properties cover the wound could prevent bacteria from penetrating, avoid the growth of bacteria, effectively prevent wound infection and provide an ideal environment for wound healing [1].\nAt present, many methods have been used to obtain wound dressings with bactericidal activity. These methods include the materials with intrinsic bactericidal activity, surface modification and adding antibacterial drugs[2]. Therefore, a wide variety of antibacterial dressings have been developed[1, 3, 4]. They have been made of different natural or synthetic materials based on various carriers (fibers[5, 6], hydrogels[7-11], hydrocolloids[1,3], sponges[1, 12], films[1, 13-15], three-dimensional membranes[15-17]). Although the traditional fiber-based antibacterial dressings are easy to obtain and can be widely produced, they still cannot meet the needs of complex wound treatment because they tend to adhere to the wound and cause pain during changing of dressing. The gelled fiber-based antibacterial dressings have the moisture prevention function, which can reduce the pain during changing of dressing, and maintain the moist environment\naround the wound to promote healing. But the fibrous antibacterial dressings are not suitable for the wounds with large amount of exudate, because of their limited liquid absorption capacity. Hydrogels can cover the wounds better, absorb water well and are easy to be replaced, which provide good conditions for moist healing because they can store large amounts of water in their three-dimensional polymer networks and provide a moisture environment for the wounds as well. However, the weak mechanical properties of hydrogels limit their development. Hydrogels, which do not adhere and can easily be washed out by saline or disinfectant, belong to painless dressings. But they may have cytotoxic and unpleasant smell, low mechanical stability and a possibility to acidize the wound. The sponge antibacterial dressings, with large pores and good absorption, can provide heat insulation and maintain the moisture environment around the wound. However, the poor adhesion of sponge-based dressings may cause skin immersion and the tissue is easy to grow into the pores, leading to a secondary trauma, which is not suitable for the third degree burn treatment or eschar wound. The membrane-based antibacterial dressings are transparent and can be used to observe the wound condition directly. They can also keep the wound in a moisture environment and are painless, but these dressings are difficult to handle, and the absorption is poor. When they adhere to the wound, it is easy to cause the accumulation of exudate and leads to infection.\nThe three-dimensional membranes are considered as a physical barrier, and can reproduce the three-dimensional structure of the primary extracellular matrix. The high specific surface and pores of three-dimensional membranes are essential to ensure cell proliferation, gas exchange, nutrition supply and control of fluid loss. The reported works show that different dressings have different properties and are only suitable for the treatment of a specific type of wounds. The antibacterial dressings still need to be further improved and may need to be combined with other materials to get preferable properties.\nIn order to improve the antibacterial properties of dressings, a variety of antibacterial drugs or agents have been incorporated into their structures[1,12], mainly including antibiotics, nanoparticles (such as silver nanoparticles and TiO2) and natural raw materials (such as honey, essential oil, and chitosan). However, all these antibacterial drugs or raw materials have limitations. For example, antibiotics are easy to induce drug resistance. Chitosan and other natural antibacterial substances are mainly suitable in a low infection degree situation. Silver nanoparticles, TiO2 and other antibacterial agents all have certain cytotoxicity besides their strong antibacterial ability. Therefore, the development of new antibacterial agents is still a hot research topic.\nMicro/nano carbon functional materials (including activated carbon fibers[18, 19], carbon nanotubes[20], graphene[21-24], carbon dots[24,25] and three-dimensional block carbon aerogels[26]) which can be used as carriers or antibacterial materials in field\nof antibacterial dressings have attracted the attention of researchers and medical workers. Since these micro/nano carbon functional materials possess advantages of abundant raw materials, low cost in preparation, good mechanical stability, strong biocompatibility, biodegradability and antibacterial activity. At present, the antibacterial strategies of micro/nano carbon functional materials include their hybrid of antibacterial metal nanoparticles, antibacterial polymer composite materials, which enhance the structural stability of the wound dressings, improve the photothermal antibacterial performance , etc."

      "heading" : "2 Active carbon fiber-based antibacterial dressings",
      "text" : "As a porous carbon fiber material with good adsorption capacity, active carbon fibers (ACFs) show excellent characteristics like large specific surface area, high speed of adsorption and desorption, easy regeneration, strong chemical stability, good flexibility and strength, good biocompatibility and biological activity, which made them ideal as cell scaffold materials. According to the application features of implants in promoting the growth and interaction of different cells, ACFs can produce redox reaction with a variety of coagulation factors in the wound, activate coagulation, accelerate hemostasis, and relieve bleeding. It can be seen that ACFs have great application potential in antibacterial dressings owing to their strong adsorption capacity, effective controlling of the inflammatory reaction and promotion on the wound healing[27, 28].\nfibers and gentamicin incorporated into a γ-PGA/gelatin membrane[29]. Reprinted with permission.\nFibroblasts can help to restore some functions of skin in the proliferation stage, and ultimately promote the normalization of wound healing by increasing the number of fibroblasts in the extracellular matrix and by increasing the secretion of collagen and protein. In 2012, Huang et al[29] developed a multifunctional double-layer wound dressing consisting of three-dimensional ACFs and poly (-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA)/gelatin film containing gentamicin (Fig. 1). Gentamicin was added into the γ-PGA/gelatin membrane to prevent bacterial infection. Three dimensional ACFs could promote the growth and migrating of fibroblasts to the wound site for tissue regeneration. The vitro field emission scanning electron microscopic images showed that the fibroblasts of rat skin diffused on the surface of ACFs and penetrated the inside and outside of the three-dimensional ACFs structure, with a depth of about 200 μm. The vivo analysis showed that the bio functional dressings with fibroblasts and three-dimensional scaffold materials had the potential to accelerate the recovering of the wound. In addition, compared with Tegaderm hydrocolloid dressings or gauze, the double-layer wound dressings containing fibroblasts could promote skin regeneration faster since the fibroblasts could migrate to the wound site and enhance the expression of fibronectin and type I collagen.\nDue to a unobvious antibacterial effect of ACF dressing, 2014, Wang Ying[18] designed a nano-silver/ACF composite dressing for pressure sore treatment by modifying ACFs with silver nanoparticles, based on the good inhibitory effect of silver nanoparticles on microorganisms and pathogenic bacteria. This dressing got the characteristics of both nano-silver and ACFs dressing, that is, high adsorption capacity, rich micropores, and efficient bactericidal performance. The nano-silver/ ACF composite dressing could effectively absorb wound exudate, kill the bacteria, prevent the invasion of microorganisms in vitro, and reduce the probability of infection. Moreover, they could properly release\nmoisturizing ingredients and show a strong antibacterial effect with their own clean filter, greatly reducing the unnecessary loss of proteins, hormones, enzymes, vitamins, and other substances that beneficial to wound healing. When this nano-silver/ACF composite dressing was used, the bacteriostatic circles to Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more obvious compared to just using silver nanoparticles dressing, active carbon dressing or chlorhexidine Vaseline dressing. These outcomes proved that the excellent bacteriostatic effect of nano-silver/ACF composite dressing can effectively promote the pressure sore wound treatment and healing.\nIn 2016, Nina Murphy[30] reported a new antibacterial dressing, Zorflex made of 100% activated carbon cloth, which reduced the infection of chronic leg ulcer. The Zorflex could safely remove bacteria during dressing change because the bacteria can be attracted and attach onto the surface of Zorflex. Moreover, it had no toxic effect, and can be used in both short term and long term. It was found that the active carbon cloth dressing can treat the recurrent infection of chronic venous ulcer of the lower extremity. It had a good therapeutic effect compared with just using silver nanoparticles, iodine or polyhexamethylene biguanide antibacterial dressing. The infection symptoms decreased significantly within 4 weeks and the prognosis of the patients was good.\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common bacteria in burn, surgery and infection. In 2017, Ashfaq et al[31] prepared a highly effective wound dressing biomaterial based on Cu/Zn carbon micro/nano fiber polymer composite (ACF/CNF) to deal with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa with multiple and extensive drug resistance (Fig. 2). In this study, Cu/Zn bimetallic dispersion ACF/CNF was used as the reinforcement material to synthesize the wound dressing of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) polymer composite membrane (with a thickness of about 0.2 mm).\nand its biochemical tests[31]. Reprinted with permission.\nAs encapsulation agents, PVA/CAP polymer composite could not only improve the hemostatic properties of biomaterials, but also provide slow release of nanoparticles. Besides, ACF/CNF also provided good mechanical and thermal stability as the carrier of dispersed bimetallic nanoparticles. This composite has a good biocompatibility and suitable for rapid wound healing. The biochemical experiments showed that it can significantly improve the coagulation rate, platelet aggregation and macrophage proliferation in vitro. In addition, the antibacterial experiment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that bimetallic nanoparticles dispersed in the composite material as an antibacterial agent can effectively inhibit the growth of bacteria. Overall, this composite material is an effective dressing for the treatment of wounds infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa."

      "text" : "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are seamless and hollow tubes shaped graphene sheets formed by carbon atoms. They can also be regarded as hollow nanofibers with a diameter of less than 50 nm. Owing to their unique structure, CNTs have distinctive mechanical, electrical, antibacterial, and absorption properties, and have been widely used in fields of engineering scaffolds, drug delivery systems and nano sensors.\nIn view of the excellent mechanical and antibacterial properties of CNTs, in 2010, Hui et al [32] selectively wrapped cyclodextrin (-CD) on the polyethylene oxide fragment of three block copolymer and synthesized a supramolecular hydrogel by hybridizing with CNTs. Compared with ethylene oxide, the content of -CD and the network density of hydrogel both decreased, which improved the diffusion of encapsulated materials. And the modulus of the hydrogel increased slightly after the introduction of CNTs. In addition, the antibacterial activity, skin adhesion and water retention properties of the supramolecular hydrogel were also verified. At the same time, the hydrogel has the characteristics of shear thinning and is suitable for injectable biomaterials. Its cytotoxicity is comparable to that of natural hydrogel without CNTs. Therefore, this CNTs hybrid supramolecular hydrogel has great potential in biomedical applications.\nAlthough CNTs have aroused great interest for their good antibacterial properties, their antibacterial application in medical devices is limited by their cytotoxicity and aggregation in polymer matrix. In 2016, Shi et al [33] studied the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the antibacterial properties of polyurethane/CNTs electrospun nanofibers, and proposed a simple, economic, time-saving, and environmentally friendly thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanofibers containing CNTs. Firstly, CNTs were fixed on TPU electrospun nanofibers in situ by non-toxic ultrasonication for\n10 min, which can effectively inhibit the aggregation of CNTs and achieve the bactericidal effect. Secondly, TPU-g-PEG/CNTs nanofibers were prepared by UV light induced grafting polymerization. The adding of PEG could effectively reduce the toxicity of CNTs to human cells, and reduce bacterial adhesion. The TPU-g-PEG/CNTs nanofibers have good blood compatibility, including inhibition of red blood cell adhesion and low hemolysis rate. More importantly, the designed nanofibers have better antibacterial properties due to the bacterial resistance of grafted PEG and the bactericidal effect of CNTs.\nMulti wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are easy to aggregate in polymer matrix and weak in bactericidal performance, which limit their resistance to infection. To solve these problems, Liu et al [34] also designed and synthesized vancomycin hydrochloride modified MWCNTs (Van-MWCNT), and got the TPU/Van-MWCNT by fixing this Van-MWCNT in situ in thermoplastic polyurethane electrospun nanofibers with the aid of ultrasound. The preparation process using water as green solvent in this study was simple, non-toxic, and effectively reduced the aggregation of van MWCNT in electrospun nanofibers. The minimum inhibitory concentration of Van-MWCNT against Staphylococcus aureus was significantly lower than that of MWCNTs, and the bactericidal effect was achieved (Fig. 3), indicating the wound dressing application potential of the electrospun nanofibers.\nCNTs have been attracted more and more attention in the skin injury reconstruction application[35-37] owing to their excellent biological, chemical and physical properties in drug delivery systems for cancer treatment. In 2015, Nowacki et al [36] studied the application of CNTs in hemostatic dressings containing anticancer substances, and obtained a new hemostatic dressing with the anti-cancer effect. The results of nephron sparing surgery in animals showed that cisplatin filled CNTs could inhibit tumor recurrence, and could be used in local chemical prophylactic hemostatic dressing. In 2017, Liao et al [38] prepared a biological dressing called CNT/PVA/EGF composite dressing by electrospinning a mixture of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), CNT and epidermal growth factor (EGF). The CNT/PVA/EGF composite dressing has an ideal microstructure, good activity, and the desired EGF release ability, which has a positive effect on accelerating wound healing. The maximum cumulative release rates were 12.47% at 12 h and 9.4% at 48 h. At the same time, the relative growth rates of L929 fibroblasts in 12 h experimental group and 48 h group were 291.24% and 211.3%, respectively. The gross morphology and histological characteristics of the rat skin (Fig. 4) showed that the dressing could accelerate the skin healing, and the wound can be healed within 7-10 days.\nproducts of (g) MWCNT and (h) Van-MWCNT onto TPU electrospun nanofibers.

      "heading" : "4 Graphene-based antibacterial dressing",
      "text" : "Graphene is a two-dimensional carbon nanomaterials\nwith a honeycomb lattice hexagonal structure, in which each carbon atom has a sp2 hybrid orbital. Owing to its excellent mechanical, optical, electrical, and adsorption properties, it\nshows important application prospects in the fields of micro-nano processing, energy, biomedicine and drug delivery, which is considered as a revolutionary material. Graphene, including graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and other graphene materials, have attracted the great attention of many researchers as a new type of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs. Due to their remarkable molecular interaction with microorganisms, they provided a good platform for the design of antibacterial programs, such as minimizing infection, accelerating wound closure, stimulating appropriate healing without scarring and keeping wound environment moist. In 2010, Hu et al [39] reported the excellent antibacterial properties of GO and rGO for the first time. It is found that they have great application potential in biomedicine owing to their good antibacterial activity, weak cytotoxicity and excellent biocompatibility.\nThe release of silver nanoparticles and silver ions (Ag+) significantly affected the toxicity to bacteria and other organisms. Since it is difficult to maintain the stable release of high concentration Ag+, it is still a challenge to develop a high-efficiency, stable, and biocompatible silver antibacterial composite material. So Zhou et al [40] developed a new type of a solar-driven Ag/AgCl/rGO photocatalyst, which has a high antibacterial activity and stability ( Fig. 5). Under the action of the GO flakes and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) surfactant, ultrafine Ag/AgCl nanoparticles were fixed on rGO with a high content to obtain Ag/AgCl/rGO. This kind stable nano photocatalyst can produce a large number of oxidation free radicals that kill bacteria, so that high sterilization efficiency and stability were achieved. In addition, PDDA functionalized nanomaterials greatly improve\ntheir adsorption capacity, enable them to capture bacteria and enhance their bactericidal activity. Moreover, Ag/AgCl/rGO nanomaterials are very stable with a long shelf life. Taking Ag/AgCl/rGO nanomaterials as a dressing to treat burn wounds, the fast healing speed and rapid epidermal regeneration can be achieved. Therefore, they have good biomedical potential in wound healing.\nTo develop hydrogels with antibacterial and water-retaining properties, and hence to promote the development of wound dressings, in 2014, Fan et al [41] synthesized a series of Ag-graphene composite hydrogels using glucose as a green reducing agent, and acrylic acid and N, N'-methylenebisacrylamide as the crosslinking agents of Ag/graphene composites. The antibacterial properties and the ability to accelerate wound healing of the hydrogels were evaluated systematically, obtaining a novel and effective wound dressing. It was found that the composite hydrogels with a mass ratio of silver to graphene of 5∶1 showed a good antibacterial activity against Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, and also have a good biocompatibility, high expansion rate, and good ductility. At the same time, embedding graphene in hydrogels could help improving the tensile strength and elongation at break of hydrogels, which meet the requirement of the mechanical properties for finishing. When the hydrogel was used in the treatment of full-thickness skin wounds, the damaged wounds within a short period of time (15 days) was healed, and the entire thickened epidermis was successfully reconstructed. This method provided a new idea for the design of antibacterial materials such as silver/graphene composite hydrogels.\nand (c, d) the burned skin of mice treated with (c) water and (d) Ag/AgCl/rGO on the day 10, and (e) contents of\nhydroxyproline in granulation tissues of skin wounds in diffent healing periods [40]. Reprinted on with permission.\nIf the injured tissue is damaged by external mechanical pressure and improperly protected, people may die from severe infection or dehydration of the injured skin. In order to improve the mechanical properties of the dressing and maintain the moist environment of the wound, Shams et al. [14] introduced GO nanosheets as an antibacterial agent and enhancer into a new dressing membrane framework composed of polyurethane/siloxane network in 2017. The appropriate combination and distribution of GO nanosheets in the matrix make the dressings have good tensile strength and flexibility, which can protect the damaged tissue from external force. At the same time, this dressing could treat the exudate and decrease the level of exudate to low or medium level, keeping the wound in a moist environment. Therefore, this dressing could not only achieve physical protection of external force, but also maintain a moist environment on the wound. The dressing containing the best amount of GO can successfully kill bacteria and fungi strains without adverse effects on the growth and proliferation of dermal fibroblasts. The experiment of rat model in vivo confirmed that the designed dressing containing GO can effectively stimulate the wound healing process and the remodeling of new skin tissue (Fig. 6).\nAnd besides antibacterial properties, the structural stability of wound dressings is also very important for wound healing. Therefore, graphene materials with simple preparation and good mechanical strength have been added to various dressing formulations to improve their structural stability. In 2015, Mitra et al[42] reported a three-dimensional scaffold biomaterial for wound healing, in which curcumin loaded nano GO (NGO) enhances fish scale collagen and improves its mechanical stability. Collagen functionalization of NGO by type I collagen (2% NGO mixed with 1% collagen) (CFNGO) was achieved, and curcumin was used as a model drug to enter CFNGO through noncovalent interaction. The mechanical stability of CFNGO was three times that of natural collagen, which has an obvious mechanical strength improvement, biosafety, and compatibility. The antibacterial activity of curcumin-loaded CFNGO demonstrated that the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria decreased significantly, showing a significant antibacterial activity. The wound healing studies in vivo showed that the wound healing efficiency of curcumin-loaded CFNGO scaffolds was higher than that of pure collagen, which could be used as a better wound dressing. ESI showed that the materials have enzymatic degradation properties under physiological conditions. Various functional groups in NGO collagen scaffolds indicated that the scaffolds may be used for the delivery of various drugs. As a unique delivery system, the cross-linking of NGO and collagen could be suitable for the delivery of drugs, growth factors or cells.\nIn addition, Mahmoudi et al [43] also added the GO nanosheets into the chitosan/polyvinylpyrrolidone based electrospun porous membrane to obtain the physical and mechanical properties close to the natural skin in 2017, which showed a good biocompatibility. The porous nanofiber\nmembrane also has improved the survival rate of cells and bactericidal ability. Their interaction with human fibroblasts were also enhanced, causing the wound healing rate in rats was increased to 92%.\nIn 2018, Misra et al [44] synthesized a kind of effective dressing for the treatment of dermatomycosis, nano engineering electrospun scaffolds loaded with tolnaftate-graphene composite materials. They mixed the graphene nanosheets (Gn) into the antifungal drug tolnaftate (Tf) to obtain the composite drug Tf-Gn, and embedded it into the polymer blend acrylic resin RL100/acrylic resin RS100 (EuRL100/EuRS100). The nanofiber scaffold was prepared by electrospinning, among which EuRL100/EuRS100 polymer blends obtained with a mass ratio of 3∶1 have high permeability, excellent expansibility, significant hydrophilicity, great drug encapsulation efficiency and drug-controlled release properties. Moreover, it has a good antifungal activity to the pathogenic Trichophyton rubrum, which causes tinea pedis (Hong Kong foot). Therefore, this nanofiber scaffold is a potential dressing for effective treatment of dermatomycosis.\nTo prevent wound infection and promote wound healing in the early stage, Li et al [45] proposed a new nanotechnology strategy to develop a flexible patch in 2017. rGO was used to enhance the bacteria inhibition performance of the gold-plated polymer (Kapton) skin patch, which can rapidly and efficiently treat subcutaneous wound infection through photothermal irradiation (Fig. 7). The application of this skin patch combined with laser treatment can effectively prevent the infection. The skin patch shows good near-infrared photothermal properties produced by gold nano (Au NHs) pore array that is self-assembled on a flexible polyimide film and rGO nanosheets used for laser-gated pathogen inactivation.\nmembranes containing 5 wt% graphene oxide nanoplatelets as\nantimicrobial wound dressings during the wound healing process for\n20 days.

Reprinted with permission.\nTherefore, the bactericidal activity could be adjusted and switched by light to obtain a high efficiency of photothermal conversion, which completely eliminates the Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. In addition to the dual photothermal effect shown by near-infrared radiation, the skin patch was also used to treat subcutaneous skin inflammation. Owing to the firmness of these patches, there was no loss of bactericidal activity when the rGO with a thickness less than 100 nm was used for more than 10 times under light. Thus, the reusability of the patches and the possibility of disinfecting them decrease their cost and show great potential market value. In addition, this convenient patch instead of injecting nanostructures for photothermal pathogen treatment, making it a safe and attractive alternative.\nRecent studies have shown that a series of carbon nanomaterials have intrinsic peroxidase activity. Among them, GQDs have a high enzyme activity [46]. As H2O2 is a low-cost broad-spectrum antibacterial agent, Sun et al [47] proposed a combination of GQDs and low-dose H2O2 antibacterial system in 2014 and proved that the band-aid based on this system has a good effect on wound disinfection. It was found that the peroxidase-like activity of GQDs is attributed to their catalytic conversion of H2O2 to hydroxyl radicals ·OH. Because ·OH a has high antibacterial activity, the conversion of H2O2 to ·OH can improve the antibacterial performance of H2O2, thus avoiding using a high dose toxic H2O2 during wound disinfection. The intrinsic activity of the system has a high enhancement effect on the antibacterial activity of H2O2, and has a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus). In addition, in order to evaluate the antibacterial effect of this system in the actual wound disinfection, GQD based band-aid was prepared and showed a good antibacterial performance with the assistance of a low dose H2O2 in vivo, indicating the potential of GQDs in antibacterial wound dressings."

      "text" : "Carbon dots (CDs) are a new type of carbon nanomaterials after carbon nanofibers, CNTs, and graphene.\nThey are nanoparticles with particle sizes less than 10 nm and rich in various functional groups on their surface (such as–OH,–COOH, –NH2). Because CDs not only have the advantages of the wide source of raw materials, simple and rapid preparation, and lower production cost, but also have the advantages of small size effect, easy surface modification, water solubility, low toxicity, etc. They have better optical performance[48], biocompatibility and antibacterial performance. At present, they have been also emerging in the application field of antibacterial dressings[24]. According to the core structure, CDs can be classified into[49] (Fig. 8) GQDs, carbon nanodots (CNDs), and polymer-like carbon dots (PDs). Among them, the application of GQDs in antibacterial dressings was detailed in the section of graphene-based antibacterial dressings.\nAs monitoring the pH value of the wound is an important diagnostic factor in the process of wound healing, Omidi et al[50] developed a new type of chitosan/CDs composite membrane (Fig. 9) in 2017. Studies on the antibacterial activity and cell viability of Staphylococcus aureus and L929 fibroblasts showed that they have good biocompatibility and non-toxic antibacterial properties.

The optimized chitosan/CDs nanocomposite was used as the wound healing bandage. Experimental in rats showed that the nanocomposite not only has good antibacterial properties and high pH sensitivity, but also could improve the wound healing process. Therefore, the advantages of strong antibacterial performance, non-toxic to fibroblasts, and good pH sensitivity enable its use as an effective antibacterial non-toxic wound dressing by enhancing wound healing and pH monitoring, which show broad application prospects as intelligent materials."

      "heading" : "6 Carbon aerogel-based antibacterial dressing",
      "text" : "Aerogel is a class of three-dimensional porous framework material with low density, high surface area, continuous porosity, and high crosslinking structure. The highly porous properties of aerogel enable antibacterial agents,\ndrugs and nanoparticles to be uniformly integrated into it and fixed into its pore network, providing sustained release of antibacterial agents and drugs at an acceptable antibacterial level [51]. At present, as a safe, cheap, ultra-light and easy handling material, aerogel has been developed in wound healing [52]. Carbon aerogel, as a new type of aerogel, not only has the characteristics of aerogel, but also has excellent physical, chemical and mechanical properties of carbon-based materials. Several literatures have been reported the application of carbon aerogel in antibacterial dressings [51,53]. In 2015, Zheng et al [54] developed a new antibacterial cellulose nano-carbon aerogel. The bacterial cellulose nano-silver composite was prepared by an in-situ reduction method, and then freeze-dried by liquid nitrogen to obtain the bacterial cellulose aerogels with silver nanoparticles. The carbonization of cellulose was performed through heating under nitrogen atmosphere in an aseptic furnace to synthesize a nano-cellulose carbon aerogel with good antibacterial, biocompatibility, mechanical properties and release stability. The cost of this method is low, and the shape and size of the\nprepared products are easy to control, which also has a good biocompatibility. Therefore, antibacterial cellulose nano-carbon aerogel can be used in common antibacterial dressings, implants, drug release and other related biomedical fields.\n７ Conclusions and prospect\nGreat progresses have been made in the application of carbon-based antibacterial agents and dressings in wound treatment. They are mainly reflected in the following aspects. ACFs have been used in the practical application, CNTs and graphene-based antibacterial materials have been developed rapidly in the enhanced mechanical properties of antibacterial dressings for wound healing. As a new type of nanocarbon material after CNTs and graphene, CDs have abundant development space in the preparation and application of antibacterial dressings owing to their photoinduced bactericidal properties. Carbon aerogels with a three-dimensional space structure are expected to be the ideal carrier materials for various antibacterial agents, and dressings based on carbon aerogels can not only bandage wounds, but also play a positive role in the healing process, which brings a bright prospect for medical care.\nHowever, there are still challenges in the research of nano carbon-based antibacterial dressings in wound treatment. To achieve the large-scale clinical application of nanocarbon materials in antibacterial dressings, there is still a long way to go. For example, the antibacterial mechanism of nanocarbon materials has not been fully determined. CNTs, CDs and other new nano antibacterial agents may have cytotoxic effects during long-term use. The biological multifactorial nature and the complex human response to infection also restrict the clinical application of nano carbon-based antibacterial dressings. Therefore, while new antibacterial dressings are synthesized, it is still necessary to systematically and deeply study the antibacterial mechanism, biosafety, various reaction mechanisms and influence mechanisms of carbon nanomaterials. On this basis, combing carbon nanomaterials with other antibacterial drugs or materials can further improve the therapeutic effect. Besides, due to the comprehensive progress of materials science, microfluidics, optical physics, nanometer engineering, tissue engineering and other disciplines, new intelligent dressings can be developed as physical and chemical barriers, as growth factors and cell delivery equipment, and as antibacterial barriers. Carbon-based dressings containing sensors and molecular therapy can be produced to simultaneously treat and monitor infected wounds, which will make a significant contribution to reducing wound infections and saving lives."
