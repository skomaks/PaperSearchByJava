      "text" : "In regard to the rapid infrastructure development in the current scenario, concrete is considered to be the second most widely used construction material; the first being water [1]. Therefore, innovative sustainable construction materials such as geopolymers which consume less natural resource and energy seem to be the need of the hour. Geopolymers binders and concretes are usually referred as alkali-activated materials and are reported to replace 100% ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and, at the same time, bear improved mechanical and durability properties than the conventional cement-based materials [2–4]. However, the bond synthesis mechanism of geopolymers is different than that of conventional cementbased materials. The precursor materials used for the preparation of geopolymer concrete should be essentially rich in silica and alumina which are further activated by a mixture of sodium/potassium-based alkaline solutions to form aluminosilicate networks. The strength development in the case of geopolymers does not depend on C-S-H (Calcium Silicate Hydrate) gel formation rather compound phases such as C* Hasan Suliman Assaedi hsassaedi@uqu.edu.sa 1 CSIR- Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India 2 Green Tech Concrete and Research, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India 3 Department of Civil Engineering, GCE, Keonjhar, Odisha, India 4 Department of Civil Engineering, VSSUT, Burla, Sambalpur, Odisha, India 5 Department of Civil Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkatta, India 6 Department of Physics, Faculty of Applied Science, Umm Al-Qura University, P.O.

Hence, industrial wastes such as fly ash, GGBFS, silica fume (SF), or rice husk ash (RHA) [1], which has appropriate amounts of silica and alumina, could be used as potential precursor materials for geopolymerization.\nIn recent times, substantial advances regarding the improvement of properties of FA based geopolymers have been made and one of the promising additives is GGBFS [5]. Therefore, fly ash in combination with GGBFS based geopolymer concrete may be considered to a suitable alternative for conventional concrete when exposed to adverse environments [6]. The addition of GGBFSwith fly ash significantly increases the compressive strength of geopolymer concrete by contributing extra CaO to the geopolymer matrix and thus producing C-S-H/C-A-S-H gels [7, 8]. Several types of research are reported in the literature based on the fresh and hardened properties of FA–GGBFS based geopolymer concrete [9–11] which suggests that inclusion of GGBFS as partial replacement of fly ash provides an overall improvement in the setting times, strength, microstructure with reduced workability. Such improvement in the properties is because of the simultaneous occurrence of reaction mechanisms i.e. polymerization and hydration from fly ash and GGBFS respectively [12]. However, early age strength gain along with workability are the major issues for the wider applications of FAGGBFS based geopolymer concrete: for which there is a demand for performance-enhancing additives such as silica fume and nano-silica [13].\nSilica fume (SF), also known as micro-silica, is a byproduct of the silicon smelting process from the ferrosilicon industry, which is generated as a result of the reduction of high-purity quartz with coal in the electric furnaces. It contains very small-sized particles which are rich in amorphous silicon dioxide (SiO2) and serves as an extremely reactive pozzolanic material. SF is mostly utilized as an additive in the production of geopolymer concrete because of its behavior as fillers. The inclusion of SF not only improves the compressive strength but also enriches the cohesive behavior between precursor materials and aggregates [14]. Apart from this, the addition of SF helps reducing permeability and rate of segregation of the fresh geopolymer concrete mixes [15]. Thokchom et al. [16] studied the effect of SF (2.5-5.0%) on the properties of fly ash-based GPC and found that SF improves both the mechanical and durability properties of the resulting geopolymer concrete. Likewise, Okoye et al. [17] reported that the properties of geopolymer concrete containing 20% of SF had significant resistivity against chemical attacks and also established its economic advantage. However, Cheah et al. [18] found that the excessive dose of SF alters the mechanical and durability properties. In another study by Duan et al. [19], they revealed that the microstructure and thermal resistance of geopolymers improved with the addition of SF but the effect of SF largely\ndepends upon the type of alkaline solution and curing regime adopted.\nRecently, nano-sized amorphous silica, also known as nano-silica (NS) has gained increased popularity for its usage in construction industries. This is due to the fact that NS has an extremely high surface area which provides substantial improvements in properties of concrete and also acts as porefillers [20, 12]. Fly ash based geopolymer concrete requires elevated temperature curing for strength development which limits its use for in situ applications. This limitation can be easily overcome by inclusion of suitable quantity of nano silica (NS) [21]. NS as an additive material to fly ash based geopolymer concrete has been reported to increase the dissolution rate of Si and Al which influences the polymerization reactions thus resulting in the improved performance of geopolymer concrete [22]. In a study by Deb et al. [23], the influence of the addition of NS on properties of fly ash based geopolymer mortar was discussed. Inclusion of 2.0% NS of the binder (FA) greatly improved the compressive strength from 29 MPa to 67 MPa. The authors also revealed that the presence of silicates accelerated the geopolymerization process which helped in the improvement of strength. This similar behavior of NS as a strength-enhancing additive has also been reported [24, 25]. Further, in the study [26], the authors claimed that 2.0%NS in the fly ash based geopolymer mixture made the microstructure denser and more compact when analyzed through SEM/EDX which ultimately resulted in higher strength gain.\nThe early strength development and workability related to FA-GGBFS based geopolymer concrete can be improved by using suitable silica-based additives such as SF and NS. Although there are studies available on the role of NS and SF at an individual level, fewer studies are made on the inclusion of both NS and SF for the preparation of FA-GGBFS geopolymer concrete. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of both SF and NS as property enhancers (fresh and hardened) on FA-GGBFS based geopolymer concrete and to achieve an optimum mix regarding the quantity of NS and SF while taking care of the financial prospects too. For comparisons, the optimized mixes made out of SF and NS were analyzed through various microstructural and mineralogical tests for a better understanding of strength development."

A mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate was used as an alkaline activator in the weight ratio of 1:2. The molar concentration of sodium hydroxide solution was kept 12 M. Both superplasticizer (PCE based) and extra water are also mixed to the fresh geopolymer concrete by 0.8% and 4.0% (by wt. of total binder content), respectively to enhance the workability.

The cube moulds of 150 mm size as per IS10,086 [30] was considered for specimen preparation and were filled in three consecutive layers followed by compaction and vibration. The cast cube specimens were then cured up to 28 days under the outdoor temperature curing at an average temperature of 31.4 . The compression test at the age of 3, 7, 14 and 28 days was done as per IS-516 [31] with the help of a compression testing machine (CTM) of capacity 2000kN.

      "text" : "The workability (slump values) of the fresh FA-GGBFS GPC mixtures made with NS and SF are presented in Fig. 2. The workability slightly improved when the NS and SF were added to the mix; this is due to the ball-bearing effect owing to the spherical particle shape of these materials [13, 14]. However, the slump values are found to be better in comparison to the control FA-GGBFSGPCmix. The slump values of\nall the fresh GPC mixtures containing NS in the range of 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2% and 2.5% NS are found to be 55 mm, 54 mm, 58 mm, 58 mm and 55 mm respectively. Similarly, for the same range of dosages, the slump value of SF added GPC are found to be 41mm, 49mm, 53mm, 53mm and 50 mm respectively. In both cases, with the increasing percentage of NS or SF, the workability greatly improved up to 2.0%, after which there was a decline in the slump values as observed from Fig. 2. The workability behavior of the mixtures GPCNS1.5 and GPCNS2.0 are found to be following a similar trend as GPCSF1.5 and GPCSF2.0. Apart from the initial improvements offered by NS [13], the inclusion of NS also led to reduction in the workability [33, 34] when the\nTable 2 Mixture proportions Mix name Materials in kg/m3\nFA GGBFS SF NS FA CA SH solution\nSS SP Extra water\nGPCSFNS 0.0\n343 147.00 0.00 0.00 490 1470 73 154 3.92 19.6\nGPCSF 0.5 343 146.265 0.735 0.00 490 1470 73 154 3.92 19.6\nGPCSF 1.0 343 145.530 1.470 0.00 490 1470 73 154 3.92 19.6\nGPCSF 1.5 343 144.795 2.205 0.00 490 1470 73 154 3.92 19.6\nGPCSF 2.0 343 144.06 2.940 0.00 490 1470 73 154 3.92 19.6\nGPCSF 2.5 343 143.325 3.675 0.00 490 1470 73 154 3.92 19.6\nGPCNS 0.5 343 146.265 0.00 0.735 490 1470 73 154 3.92 19.6\nGPCNS 1.0 343 145.530 0.00 1.470 490 1470 73 154 3.92 19.6\nGPCNS 1.5 343 144.795 0.00 2.205 490 1470 73 154 3.92 19.6\nGPCNS 2.0 343 144.06 0.00 2.940 490 1470 73 154 3.92 19.6\nGPCNS 2.5 343 143.325 0.00 3.675 490 1470 73 154 3.92 19.6\nNB:- FA- fly ash, GGBFS- ground granulated blast furnace slag, SF- silica fume, NS- nano silica, FA- fine aggregate, CA- coarse aggregate, SH- sodium hydroxide, SS- sodium silicate, SP-super plasticizer\nquantity of NS is added beyond 1.5%.

However, in some studies [37], an increase in the quantity of SF beyond a certain value in the FA based geopolymer mix led to further rise in the slump values proportionally. The decline in slump values after 1.5% of the addition of NS and SF may be due to the fact that both have a large surface area as a result of which they consumed the free water generated from the mixture making the mix more cohesive which ultimately led to the decrease in the slump.

      "heading" : "3.2 Effect of NS and SF on Setting Time",
      "text" : "The setting time test on the optimum mixtures is conducted to observe the effect of SF and NS on initial and final set times. From Fig. 3, it can be observed that in addition to both NS and SF the setting of the geopolymers pastes delays up to some extent. The standard mix (GPCSFNS 00) has its initial and final setting time at 120 and 156 min, respectively. Whereas, with 1.5% NS addition the initial setting of the paste extended to 143 min, and the final set was observed at 195 min. Similar observations are also found for SF incorporation, at 1.5% SF, the initial setting time increased to 135 min and the final setting time increased to 180 min. This retarding effect of silica sources on setting time in geopolymers is observed by several researchers [14, 33]. It is obvious that with NS or SF addition, the silica species in the matrix increases, which leads to forming more silicate oligomers, and the conversion of silicate oligomers to polymer network is a time-consuming process, thus it delays the setting process of the paste [39]. However in the case of NS, the delay in the setting process is more than that of the SF, this results due to more reactivity of NS as compared to SF."

The compressive strength of geopolymer concrete specimens with SF incorporation is presented in Fig. 4. The control mix (0% SF) exhibited a compressive strength of 56.53 MPa after 28 days of outdoor curing conditions. On the other hand, the compressive strength of the mix containing 1.5% SF was found to be 57.04 MPa at the age of 14 days, which indicates the early age strength improvement. The mix GPCSF0.5 did not show any significant strength improvement both in the case of early and later age strength development. However, the mixture with 1.0% SF (GPCSF1.0) showed an increment of about 8.86% at the age of 3 days and 3.69% at the age of 28 days in compressive strength as compared to the control mixture. From the Fig. 4, it can be observed that highest compressive at the age of 28 days was achieved by the mixture with 1.5% of SF (GPCSF1.5). An increase of 18.9% (3 days) and 5.94% (28 days) was noted for the rise in the compressive strength of the optimum mix i.e. GPCSF1.5 with respect to the control mixture. The improvement in the strength development of FA-GGBFS based GPC could be due to the injection of high reactive silica with small particle sizes that acted as fillers and enriched the cohesiveness between precursor materials and aggregates [14]. These properties of SF facilitated a higher degree of geopolymerization to form sodium or calcium-based silicates [40] as found from XRD analysis (Sect. 3.5.1) which led to an increase in the compressive strength. Conversely, when the addition of SF was further increased to 2.0% and 2.5%, there was no substantial increase in strength when compared to the mixture containing 1.5% SF. The overdose of SiO2 by the inclusion of SF beyond\n2.0% would have hindered the geopolymerization reactions, thereby increasing the Si/Al ratio of the mix [18]. The results of this analysis indicate that the optimal dosage of SF for compressive strength improvement of FA-GGBFS based GPC is 1.5%."

From the figure, it can be noted that strength of all mixes containing NS (0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2%, and 2.5%) improves in comparison to the control mixture taken. The highest compressive strength of 63 MPa achieved by the mix GPCNS1.5 at the age of 28 days of outdoor curing. Previously in Sect. 3.3.1, it was observed that 0.5% of SF showed no strength improvement at all ages of curing. However, as NS has high reactivity and large surface area, considerable improvements in strength has been observed with the inclusion of 0.5% of NS (GPCNS0.5). The compressive strength showed a significant improvement of 20.61%, 6.42% and 6.43% at the age of 3, 14 and 28 days, respectively. It is also important to note that the addition of 1.0% and 1.5% of NS into the mix behaves similarly to SF added FA-GGBFS GPC mixes in compressive strength development. From the\nFig. 5, it is understood that 1.5% of NS would be the optimum dosage to be considered for strength improvement, as further increase in the quantity of NS addition led to reduction in strength. The improvement in the compressive strength is due to very small size particles of NS which act as pore filler making the matrix denser and more compact [12]. Moreover, the increase in soluble silica concentration in the NS included GPC mixes [41–43], made the geopolymer binder stronger and accelerated the geopolymer reactions which eventually\nimproved the compressive strength of the mixes [44]. The possible reason for the reduction in the compressive strength beyond 1.5% of NS could be due to excess availability unreacted NS in the matrix [45, 23]. Furthermore, the inclusion of 2% and 2.5% of NS could have led to the agglomeration of NS which could have hindered the silica dissolution thereby leading to the formation of voids as a result of which strength loss was observed [46]."

      "text" : "Curing temperature predominates the strength development behavior in the case of geopolymers and its effect has been studied extensively by several researchers in the past [47–49]. The majority of prior studies based on fly ash-based geopolymer pastes/concretes followed curing in elevated temperatures which resulted in high early strength gain [3, 50]. On the other hand, curing under ambient conditions facilitated strength gain gradually [51, 52] requires less energy and suitable for in-situ applications [53, 54]. Hardjito et al. [3] reported that with the increase of curing temperature, the compressive strength of the geopolymer specimens increased. They also established a range of curing temperatures, i.e., 60 -90 , which could be implemented for high strength development of geopolymer concrete. Likewise, Bakri et al. [55] suggested temperature of 60 for optimum strength development in fly ash-based GPC; they got a maximum strength of 67.04 MPa during their investigation. B. Mo et al. [56] studied the effect of various temperature conditions on the strength development of metakaolin based GPC. They found in their results that 60 was the suitable curing temperature for strength development but they also mentioned the possible negative effect of high-temperature curing (beyond 80 ).\nIn this study, cast geopolymer specimens were subjected to outdoor temperature curing conditions for 28 days to observed improvements in the early age strength gain of NS and SF added FA-GGBFS GPC. The influence of curing temperature on the compressive strength development was scrutinized throughout the curing period i.e. 28 days keeping note of the maximum and minimum temperatures of each day. From the temperature profile of the curing period, it is observed that maximum and minimum temperatures were 42 and 23 , respectively (Avg. temp 31.4 ). The increased temperature during the day time (42 ) enhanced the geopolymerization rapidly, thus high early strength development was observed in all the GPC mixes as observed from the compressive strength development profiles. From the above discussions, it can be easily established that there is a direct proportionate relationship between compressive strength development and the curing temperature of GPC.Fig. 5 Effect of NS on compressive strength development of GPC"

The diffractogram of both source materials and optimum geopolymer mixtures are represented below in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. All identified mineral phases from the diffraction analysis of resulted optimum GPC mixes are also tabulated in Table 3. In Fig. 6, the diffractograms of FA and GGBFS show the presence of quartz and mullite, whereas calcite is only present in GGBFS indicating the presence of calcium. In NS and SF, quartz is present predominately with some peaks of cristobalite, and stishovite is only present in SF. Out of the three polymorph of silica, quartz is more reactive hence actively participated in geopolymerization whereas the cristobalite might have partially reacted to produce reaction product and stishovite is a stable phase of silica thus acted as filler to the gel matrix. In the mix GPCSF 1.5, the prominent phases are enstatite ferroan and gyrolite which are mostly silicate phases associated with Na or Ca indicating the formation of geopolymer networks. The quartz phase at 21.1 and 26.9 (2 theta position) could be due to the presence or unreacted silica precursor from FA or SF; moreover the presence of quartz may be due to the silica present in aggregates which remains unreacted. High MgO content of GGBFS facilitated the formation of magnesium rich silicate minerals such as diopside aluminian, syn (Ca(Mg, Al) (Si , Al )2O6) and ens ta t i t e fe r roan\n((Mg1.385Fe0.395Ca0.01Al0.21)(Si1.76Al.024O6)) in association with calcium which assisted in the strength development process of GPCSF1.5. The iron content of the GGBFS also contributed in reaction mechanism forming partially amorphous mineral complexes of enstatite ferroan in both the mixture with a slightly different chemical composition (see Table-3); the occurrence of this mineral phase could be in a line with the formation of the poly (ferrosialate-siloxo) and poly (ferro-sialate-disiloxo) as obtained by J. Davidovits and R. Davidovits [57] having a formula close to [Ca,Na,K,Mg]– [–Fe–O–]x–[Si–O–Al– O–]1-x–[–Si–O]y where “x” is less than or equal to 0.5, “y” is a value between 0 and 25.

Though XRF doesn’t signify the mineral phases distinctly, it stretches the information regarding the presence of various minerals in the oxide state, which help determine the possible mineral phases in correlation with diffraction data. From Fig. 7, it can be observed that quartz (SiO2), gyrolite (sodium calcium aluminum silicate hydroxide hydrate), calcite (calcium carbonate) and enstatite ferroan (magnesium calcium aluminum iron silicate) andesine (sodium calcium aluminum silicate) and diposide aluminian, syn (calcium magnesium aluminum silicate) are the dominating mineral phases of both the mixtures; the high silicon oxide content as found from XRF justifies the presence of these silica rich silicate minerals. Moreover from Fig. 8, it can be seen that the SiO2, Al2O3, CaO and Na2O contributes nearly 95–98% of the total mass of the concrete which explains the presence of major phases associating with Si, Al, Na, and Ca throughout both the complexes."

The splitting of absorption bands in the ranges of 1446– 1476 cm− 1 and 1422–1482 cm− 1 observable on GPCSF1.5 and GPCNS1.5 samples, respectively are linked to C-O stretching of carbonate groups resulting from the reaction of unreacted Na+ during the geopolymerization reaction with atmospheric air CO2 known as efflorescence phenomenon [8] suggesting the elimination of degenerescency due to the distortion [61]. Similar reaction was observed by Djobo et al. [62] and Kaze et al. [63] during the synthesis of volcanic ash and laterite based geopolymers, respectively. These authors found that the degree of splitting depend on metal cation type capable to fix carbonate group. The both materials used as solid precursors contained Mg, Na, Fe and Ca oxides in their chemical composition. Thus, these oxides in alkaline medium would release Mg2+, Na+, Fe2+/Fe3+ and Ca2+ ions which could be associated to CO2 − 3. However, regarding the XRD patterns of both geopolymer concretes Ca2+ and Na+ ions are responsible for the degree of splitting (observed on FTIR spectra) although the presence of other ions. Thus, this trend justified the presence of such mineral phases like gyrolite, calcite and enstatite ferroan as shown in Fig. 7.

These values are higher compared to those of literature (around 1000 cm− 1) is due to possible insertion of calcium ions into tetrahedra site or additional silica species from silica sources (Silica fume and nano silica used in this work) resulting in an extension geopolymer network [65, 66]. The band situated 777 cm− 1 in all spectra is due to the stretching vibration of 6- coordinated Al (VI)-O bond [67]. The lower absorption bands located at 536, 580, 643 and 696 cm− 1 correspond to the stretching and bending vibration modes of Si-O-T (T = Al or Si) bonds [68]. Finally, the last bands at 431, 462 and 471 cm− 1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of Mg-O [68]. The trend of FTIR analysis is in line which the one of XRD."

      "text" : "The fractures of GPCSF1.5 and GPCNS1.5 samples exhibiting in detail their internal texture are reported in Fig. 10 (a-b). Both micrographs appear heterogeneous compact and dense describing the high cohesion between binder phase and coarse particles justifying the high mechanical performances achieved. No fissures and cracks were observed on both specimens indicating the important amount of binder phase that allowing the good adhesion or bonding between different particles\nwithin the matrix. Thus, the use of silica sources from silica fume and nano-silica, induced a higher degree of geopolymerization and polycondensation contributing to good densification of the whole system resulting in high strength development. This trend is in line with the observations of several authors [69–71]. Authors found that the use of silica fume and nano silicate act as fillers by filling pores spaces and improved packing particles between binder phase, FA- fly ash and GGBFS- ground granulated blast furnace slag. Hence this cohesion seems to avoid the weak bond between\nreactive and unreacted particles in both geopolymer concretes as a result of the interface transition zone (ITZ) caused by lack of binder phase into the matrix. EDS analyses of selected spot from two areas in both samples revealed that Al, Si, Ca, Mg, O and Na are the main elements in GPCNS1.5 sample (Fig. 11b) corresponding to N-C-S-H, N-A-S-H, C-S-H and Mg(OH)2 binders type, while the latter in GPCSF1.5 contains Na, O and Si attributable to polysialate N-A-S-H gel. However, it observed the white needle crystals related to NaOH or Na2SiO3 on micrograph of GPCSF1.5 sample (Fig. 11a). This needle shapes could be either due to the non-reacted Na in geopolymer reaction with atmospheric CO2 resulting in sodium carbonate formation or to precipitation sodium silicate from of excess of reactive silicate with sodium ions. Therefore, the microstructure evolution in both geopolymer specimens is in agreement with the trend of strength development."

      "text" : "The petrographic observations of both SF and NS incorporated GPC are depicted in Figs. 12, 13, 14, 15 and\n16. The microstructural observations were taken in four different resolutions to examine the effect of NS and FS in detail, as shown in the listed figures. In Fig. 12 (a-b), the images at 5x resolution of GPCSF1.5 and GPCNS1.5 are presented respectively; identifying the microstructures of both the mixture, it can be observed that both have similar heterogeneous surface morphology as observed by SEM. However, the GPCSF1.5 has distinct needle-like structures over its surface, referring to the occurrence of efflorescence process; the unreacted sodium or calcium in the presence of carbon dioxide (atmospheric) would have lead this process, similar structures were also detected regarding SEM analysis of GPCSF1.5 (Fig. 11a). Images taken at a higher resolution (10X) gives more detail structures of the GPC specimens, as shown in Fig. 13(a-b). Figure 14 illustrates the delicate structures of the efflorescence product, which could be sodium/calcium carbonate justifying the FTIR band found at 1446–1476 cm− 1 in GPCSF1.5. High packing and gel density could be observed in both the mixture GPCSF1.5 and GPCNS1.5; in SF based mixture (Fig. 15a) some amount of unreacted FA (UFA) particles are packed as filler inside the binder phase, some unreacted SF particles are also present acted as filler to the GPC matrix, ultimately leading to a more densified gel phase. Similar observations were found in case of GPCNS1.5 (Fig. 15b), but the magnitude of UFA is less as compared to the GPCSF1.5, and instead of unreacted SF (USF), presence of unreacted NS (UNS) was observed in a minimal amount as most of the FA and NS particle have reacted to yield N-C-SH or N-A-S-H in the presence of alkalis [72]. In GPC containing SF, some partly reacted cenospheres are also found (Fig. 16a); however, in GPCNS 1.5, no such structures were noticed; this could be due to the high polycondensation mechanism leading to an intense polymerization inside the mixture. The nano-sized reactive silica is responsible for such a high degree of reactivity of the precursors contributing to high compressive strength. As mechanical properties directly depend upon\nthe intrinsic microstructure of the concrete [73], the interfacial transition zones (ITZs) considered as the weakest point in the concrete, which plays a vital role in internal stress resistance capacity of the concrete impacting the ultimate compressive strength. Therefore better the ITZs of the concrete, higher will be its compressive strength. In Fig. 16 (a-b), the ITZs of the GPC with SF and NS are spotted; GPCNS1.5 (Fig. 16b) has excellent bonding between the aggregates and the paste resulting great ITZs. However, in the case of GPCSF1.5 (Fig. 16a), resulted in ITZs are inferior to that of GPCNS1.5, justifying a lesser compressive strength of the mixture (i.e., GPCSF1.5)."

      "heading" : "4 Conclusions",
      "text" : "From the above experimental investigation, the following conclusions are drawn.\n1 Both SF and NS made significant changes in both fresh and hardened GPC samples. In both the case, the optimum percentage was found to be 1.5% of the GGBFS content, considering both fresh and hardened properties. The setting time of geopolymer paste also increases with NS and SF addition. However, the NS performed better than that of SF in FA-GGBFS based GPC in all aspects; the finer\nparticle size and comparatively high reactivity of NS is responsible for its better performance. 2 XRD and XRF revealed the microstructural and mineralogical information about the GPC mixtures. From XRD analysis, it was found that the major components that attributed the compressive strength of GPC are gyrolite (NC-S-H), andesine and enstatite ferroan, and both SF and NS had facilitated the geopolymerization process by providing extra silica precursor for the synthesis of Na/Cabased aluminum silicates. However in the case of NS, due to high surface area and reactivity, the dissolution of silica occurred more effectively facilitating the formation of geopolymer gel densifying the matrix, therefore compressive strength of NS modified GPC was superior. 3 The SF and NS caus ed a h i ghe r deg r ee o f geopolymerization and polycondensation, contributing to higher densification of the whole system resulting in high strength improvement as clarified by FTIR, SEM, and petrographic analysis. However, from SEM and petrographic observations, it is found that the unreacted NS/ SF (cristobalite and stishovite) behave like fillers by filling pores spaces, hence improving packing density of the binder phase. 4 Examining the fresh and hardened properties of SF and NS modified GPC, it can be concluded that both SF and NS improves the properties of GPC at very low replacement level. However, due to nano sized particles and high\nreactivity, the NS incorporated GPC performs better than of the SF modified GPC.\nAcknowledgements The authors duly acknowledge the contributions of all project staffs of CSIR-IMMT, Bhubaneswar, India in carrying out the experiments.

Five mixtures of each containing 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0% and 2.5% NS and SF are prepared for this investigation. The optimum GPC mixture with NS resulted in compressive strength of 63 MPa and the SF modified GPC achieved a compressive strength of 59.59 MPa after 28 days of outdoor temperature curing (Avg. temp. 31.4 ). The hardened concrete samples are analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and petrographic examination, for the better understanding of geopolymer mineralogy, mechanism and microstructure. Results indicate that both NS and SF facilitated a higher degree of geopolymerization, leading to the densification of the geopolymer matrix which led to the improvement of the properties of FA-GGBFS based GPC.",
