      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "In recent years, water pollution has become an international environmental problem that constricts the development of human health, economy and sustainability [1,2]. To solve this problem, various efficient technologies have been developed and employed to purify wastewater, such as photocatalysis, adsorption, chemical precipitation, and membrane filtration [3–6]. Among them, photocatalysis has been regarded as a promising approach due to its convenient operation, effective remediation and low environmental impacts [7,8]. Among the well-studied photocatalysts, nano iron oxides including α-Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 have received extensive investigations and increasing attentions in the field of photocatalytic decontamination, benefiting from low cost, nontoxicity, large surface area, and especially strong absorption in the visible light region [9,10]. Moreover, the favorable magnetism of iron oxides makes the recovery of catalysts more convenient and economical via applying an external magnetic field for cyclic utilization after wastewater treatment [11].\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1345; doi:10.3390/nano10071345 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1345 2 of 17\nHowever, the major drawbacks of iron oxides including low charge carriers’ mobility and rapid photogenerated electron–hole recombination rate restrict its practical applications in photocatalysis [12]. Consequently, various strategies were developed to enhance its photocatalytic properties, such as controlling diverse morphologies (e.g., nanoparticles, nanocubes and nanodiscs) [13], doping metal or non-metal ions such as Ca and I [14,15], and coupling with other semiconductors to generate satisfactory photocatalytic heterostructures. Among them, the coupling strategy with other semiconductors has been receiving extensive attentions since these heterostructures can efficiently suppress recombination rates and promote transportation rates of photo-generated charge carriers. For instance, the heterogeneous photocatalysts including α-Fe2O3@AgCO3 [16], γ-Fe2O3@Mn3O4 [17] and Fe3O4@TiO2 [18] all displayed significantly increased photocatalytic performance compared with pure iron oxides. Among the various semiconductors combined with iron oxides, TiO2 has been extensively investigated for their stable, nontoxic and economical properties [19,20]. Particularly, abundant attentions have been given to 1D TiO2 nanotubes (abbreviated as TNT in this article) due to their unique 1D nanotube architectures accompanied with superior charge transport property and large internal surface to disperse doped iron oxides nanoparticles [21–23]. Especially, the constructed heterostructures of TiO2 and iron oxides could further enhance the separation of charge carriers in this heterostructure. Recently, the majority of the researches on FexOy@TNT nanocomposites focused on Fe3O4@TNT composites [24,25]. Unfortunately, the narrow bandgap of Fe3O4 brought serious photodissolution of Fe3O4, which would deactivate the composites and induce the decrease of photocatalytic performance [25]. As a result, iron oxide species with larger bandgaps such as Fe2O3 (bandgap ~2.3 eV) rather than Fe3O4 with narrow bandgap (0.1 eV), are more beneficial for the separation of photo-induced charge carriers in the heterojunctions [26,27]. On the other hand, Fe2O3 possesses higher chemical stability than Fe3O4 at room temperature, which can be oxidized in the presence of oxygen. From this point of view, it is reasonable to believe that introducing Fe2O3 nanoparticles into TiO2 nanotubes would significantly enhance the separation of charge carriers in Fe2O3@TiO2 heterojunctions. Furthermore, the excellent magnetic property of Fe2O3 would make them easier to be recycled and regenerated in the photocatalytic decontamination research, which is considered as a sustainable material for future applications [11]. Although Fe2O3@TNT composites have bright prospects and potential applications in photocatalytic water remediation, efficient methods to synthesize TiO2 nanotubes with uniform Fe2O3 nanoparticles deposition still need to be developed since the agglomeration of Fe2O3 nanoparticles would act as the recombination center and accelerate the destruction of excitons. The extensively used manner to prepare this heterostructure is the dipping method, which is limited by the low-dispersion loading and severe agglomeration under high deposition [28,29]. In our previous work, an anaerobic oil-phase cyclic magnetic adsorption (OCMA) method was developed to uniformly deposit Fe3O4 nanoparticles into TNT, which would provide inspiration to inhibit the agglomeration of Fe2O3 nanoparticles in this work. Especially, although the carbon species was introduced into the designed Fe3O4@TiO2 composites to inhibit the migration of e- towards Fe3O4, 13.5% (in 3 h) of Fe3O4 in the prepared Fe3O4@C@TiO2 composites were still photo-dissolved, which might induce poor recycling performance [27]. As a result, the wide-bandgap Fe2O3 nanoparticles, instead of narrow-bandgap Fe3O4, were designed for fabricating Fe2O3@TiO2 composites with enhanced photocatalytic performance and inhibited photo dissolution. Especially, the designed Fe2O3@TiO2 heterostructures avoid the incorporation of carbon materials, which might have unassessed toxicity to the environment. Nevertheless, there was little work on the synthesis method and photocatalytic investigation of TiO2 nanotubes with uniform deposition of Fe2O3 nanoparticles. In this work, uniform 1D magnetic Fe2O3@TNT composites with excellent dispersive Fe2O3 deposition were newly synthesized through a new aerobic OCMA method. This new synthesizing method is more convenient and economical compared with other reported methods. Moreover, the photocatalytic performance of these nanocomposites containing different amounts of Fe2O3 under visible light irradiation were evaluated and discussed. The results indicated that there was an optimum amount of Fe2O3\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1345 3 of 17\ndeposition, which could be well explained by the physicochemical properties including Fe2O3 dispersion, PL intensity and charge carriers’ lifetime. Finally, the photo dissolution of the obtained composites was further examined by the leaching experiments and the results indicated superior repression of photo dissolution and stable regeneration of Fe2O3@TiO2 compared with Fe3O4@TiO2 and Fe3O4@C@TiO2."

Firstly, certain amounts of Fe3O4@oleic acid were ultrasonically dispersed in hexane and this suspension was filtered to remove the undispersed particles thoroughly and prepare a homogeneous solution of 1 g/L Fe3O4@oleic acid (The preparation of 1 g/L Fe3O4@oleic acid solution: Firstly, certain amounts (marked as M1) of Fe3O4@oleic acid were ultrasonically dispersed in hexane. Then, this suspension was filtered to remove the undispersed particles thoroughly. The mass of these undispersed particles can be determined and marked as M2. Therefore, the real amounts of Fe3O4@oleic acid dissolved in hexane can be calculated by M1 −M2. After adding hexane to a certain volume, the concentration of “Fe3O4@oleic acid” in the homogeneous solution can be confirmed). Then, different volumes of the homogeneous solution (0.5 mL, 1 mL, 2 mL) were added onto the anodized TNT arrays under the effect of an external magnetic field beneath the TNT arrays, as shown in Scheme 1. It should be noticed that magnetic force played a vital role in loading Fe3O4@oleic acid nanoparticles into TiO2 nanotubes and the volatilization of hexane also made a contribution. Finally, these 0.5, 1, and 2 mL suspension-loaded TNT arrays were annealed at 450 ◦C for 2 h in air atmosphere to obtain Fe2O3@TNT composites with high crystallinity, which were recorded as 0.5FeTi, 1FeTi and 2FeTi, respectively.

Photocatalytic Experiments\nFor assessments of the photocatalytic activity of the samples, Rhodamine B (RhB) solutions in concentration of 10 mg/L were first prepared. Then, 70 mg as-prepared catalysts (Fe2O3, 0.5FeTi, 1FeTi and 2FeTi) were suspended into 70 mL RhB solutions, respectively. After dark adsorption for 2 hours and reaching equilibrium, the mixed solutions were illuminated for 6 hours under visible light (λ ≥ 400 nm) using a 300 W Xenon lamp (light intensity of 90 mW·cm−2 at distance of 15 cm from the light source). During the photocatalytic experiments, 3 mL samples of the mixed solutions were taken out and centrifuged at a given time interval. Finally, the photocatalytic activity was analyzed by UV−vis absorption measurement of the characteristic peak of RhB at 554 nm. For each sample, all photocatalytic experiments were carried out for irradiation duration of 6 hours at 20 °C and were repeated three times.\n2.6. Characterizations\nThe obtained samples were characterized by an XRD diffractometer (Rigaku, D/max 2500, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å, Tokyo, Japan) within the scanning angle range of 15°–60° at rate of 8° min−1. The morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nanosem 430, FEI, Eindhoven, Netherlands) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Tecnai G20&F20, FEI, Eindhoven, Netherlands). UV-Vis measurements were performed on a Hitachi U4100 UV Spectrometer and Fluorescence spectra were measured with FLS980 Series of Fluorescence Spectrometers (excited at λ = 420 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250XI, Thermo, MA, USA) with monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source was employed to analyze elemental contents and the chemical states of these composites. All the binding energies were calibrated by contaminant carbon at 284.8 eV. BET surface areas, BJH pore volume and average pore size were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, which was measured by SSA-7000 (BJ Builder, Beijing, China). FTIR spectra were recorded on Bruker Alpha spectrometer from 4000 to 400 cm−1 (Regensburg, Germany). The magnetic properties were measured by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, MPMS SQUID XL, Quantum Design, Santiago, USA) in the field from −20,000 to 20,000 Oe.

Since the peaks related to iron species were hardly to be observed due to the small amount of deposited Fe2O3 in Figure 1A, the narrow-range XRD spectra with higher resolution were further performed to examine the iron oxide species. As shown in Figure 1B, the characteristic peak intensity at 35.6◦ increases with the rising contents of Fe2O3 in 0.5FeTi, 1FeTi and 2FeTi, which further confirms the successful deposition of iron oxides. Furthermore, 2FeTi and Fe2O3 samples were further selected and analyzed by selective area electron diffraction (SAED) to ensure the existence of Fe2O3 (Figure 1C,D). As shown in Figure 1C, the SAED pattern of Fe2O3 with characteristic rings at 3.023 Å, 2.736 Å and 2.565 Å (from inside to outside) is in good agreement with the d-spacing of γ-Fe2O3 (d220 = 2.953 Å), α-Fe2O3 (d104 = 2.700 Å) and γ-Fe2O3 (d311 = 2.518 Å) [34]. For the SAED pattern of 2FeTi composite in Figure 1D, the diffractive rings of Fe2O3 are weak but still in agreement with corresponding crystal planes of Fe2O3, which might be due to the low and uniform dispersion of Fe2O3. Especially, it should be mentioned that the SAED patterns of 1FeTi and 0.5FeTi are also examined while the weak signals of Fe2O3 hinder their further characterization by this method.

The O/Ti ratios in 0.5FeTi, 1FeTi and 2FeTi are 2.02, 2.17 and 2.31 respectively, which are close to theoretical values (2).

With the increment of deposition, the pore sizes of 1FeTi and 2FeTi decrease sharply and fall into a range near pure Fe2O3, which is probably associated with the smaller inner structures between Fe2O3 nanoparticles, characterized at about 4 nm (as shown in the inset Figure of Figure 4).

PL spectra were traditionally applied to detect the photo-chemical properties of the synthesized materials and it was considered that higher PL intensity indicated more electron-hole pairs generated in the heterostructures containing iron oxides [42]. Figure 6A clearly shows that the PL spectra of Fe2O3 nanoparticles is lower than that of three Fe2O3@TNT composites, implying that combining Fe2O3 with TiO2 nanotubes could effectively promote the generation of charge carriers. Except for the fluorescence intensity, the luminescence efficiency should also be considered by analyzing fluorescence lifetime. It can be observed in Figure 6B that the intensity of the decay curves fast diminishes after reaching the top of peak instead of a slow tailing trend, which might be due to the high charge carriers recombination rate of Fe2O3. Then, the fluorescence lifetimes of 0.5FeTi, 1FeTi, 2FeTi, and Fe2O3 were determined from the decay curves and fitted by a single exponential term. According to the corresponding equation (as shown in Figure S3), the lifetimes of 2FeTi, 1FeTi, 0.5FeTi, and Fe2O3 were calculated to be 0.6844 ns, 0.6759 ns, 0.6475 ns, and 0.6306 ns, respectively, indicating that the lifetimes also increase with the increment of Fe2O3 deposition. Additionally, these results also reveal the superb migration and effective separation of electrons and holes between Fe2O3 and TiO2, which is also shown in Scheme 2. Under the consideration of both charge carriers’ generation and their lifetimes, 2FeTi has the highest fluorescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime, which indicates that 2FeTi might have the best photocatalytic activity, followed by 1FeTi or 0.5FeTi and lastly bare Fe2O3.\nScheme 2.

Consequently, the intermediate products during photocatalysis of RhB over 1FeTi for 0–6 h were identified by HR-MS. As shown in Figure S6, the HR-MS spectra of RhB solution (t = 0 h) shifted from m/z = 443 (characterized as RhB) to m/z = 415, 387, 359, 331, 304, 302, and 272 after photo illumination, which might be ascribable to the N-de-ethylating process under the effects of photogenerated radicals [49,50]. Then, the N-de-ethylated intermediates would react with functional radicals to produce opening-ring intermediates (e.g., phthalic acid), which could be further mineralized to CO2 and H2O [49,50]. Based on these deductions, the degradation pathway of RhB was proposed and is displayed in Scheme 3. Finally, it should be mentioned that the intensity of MS spectrum at t = 6 h is much weaker than that at t = 0 h, indicating the almost total mineralization of RhB in the wastewater.\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, x 14 of 18\nScheme 3.

It could be observed from the Fe 2p spectra in Figure 9A that peak shape and intensity is almost unchanged after photocatalysis, indicating the effective inhibition of photo dissolution of the doped Fe2O3 [25].

Furthermore, the dissolution amount was determined to be 13.4% in 6 h according to Table 1 and Figure S7, which is much less than 17.5% in 0.5 h for the Fe3O4@TiO2 and 13.5% in 3 h for Fe3O4@C@TiO2 heterostructures [25,27], verifying the hypothesis that the photo dissolution could be significantly hindered by incorporating wide-gap Fe2O3 instead of narrow-gap Fe3O4. Considering the good stability of 1FeTi during photocatalysis, the regeneration experiments were performed. As shown in Figure 9B, the recyclable performance is almost stable in three cycles, and the slight reduction might be due to the moderate dissolution of Fe2O3 from the composite. Generally, 1FeTi exhibits superior repression for photo dissolution and stable regeneration, which could be considered as a promising photocatalytic medium for water remediation. Nanomaterials 2020, 10, x 15 of 18 Generally, 1FeTi exhibits superior repression for photo dissolution and stable regeneration, which\ncould be considered as a promising photocatalytic medium for water remediation.\nIn this work, 1D Fe2O3@TiO2 nanotube composites were first successfully synthesized by an\naerobic OCMA method. The structural and photo-chemical properties of the prepared Fe2O3 and\nFe2O3@TNT composites were characterized via XRD, XPS, FTIR, HRTEM, BET, UV-Vis, and PL\nspectra. Based on the XRD results, both α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3 were found to exist in pure Fe2O3. The\nsuccessful deposition of Fe2O3 was further confirmed by XPS and FTIR spectra. In addition, HRTEM\nwas also applied to evaluate the dispersity of the Fe2O3 nanoparticles, and the results indicated that\nthe nanoparticles were well dispersed on the TNT inner walls, resulting in efficient separation of\ncharge carriers and homogeneous dispersion of Fe2O3 nanoparticles, which was further verified by\nthe PL and BET analysis. According to the UV–vis spectra, the band structures of these catalysts were\nderived and it was found that the band alignments of these heterostructures were staggered, which\nmight have resulted from the coexistence of α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3. Benefiting from the superior\nstructural and photo-chemical properties, the composites exhibited much higher photocatalytic\ndegradation efficiency towards RhB than pure Fe2O3 under visible-light irradiation. The\nphotocatalytic results were in good agreement with PL results, which revealed the photoactivity\ntendency of the heterojunctions could be well predicted through fluorescence intensity and\nfluorescence lifetime. Furthermore, the introduction of Fe2O3 in Fe2O3@TNT nanostructures made\nthem easy to be separated and recovered in a magnetic field, which further confirmed that the\nsynthesized Fe2O3@TNT composites are efficient and cost-effective materials. Finally, the photo\ndissolution phenomenon of 1FeTi was examined and the low leaching amount as well as stable\nrecycling performance illustrated the promising prospects of 1FeTi for water remediation and\nrational design of Fe2O3 into TiO2 instead of Fe3O4.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at www.mdpi.com/xxx/s1, Figure S1: N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, Figure S2: Decay curve fitting procedures for the synthesized samples; Figure S3: Magnetization curve of Fe2O3.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, X.H. and J.B.; methodology, Q.T. and R.W.; formal analysis, Q.T., J.B. and C.X.; data curation, Q.T. and Y.Z.; resources, H.H. and J.W.; writing-original draft preparation, Q.T.; writingreview and editing, J.B., L.Y. and H.H.; supervision, H.H. and L.Y.

XRD and TEM analyses were performed to verify the uniform deposition of Fe2O3 nanoparticles on the nanotube inner walls of TiO2. The steady-state degradation experiments exhibited that 1FeTi possessed the most superior performance, which might be ascribable to the satisfying dark adsorption capacity, efficient photocatalytic activity, ease of magnetic separation, and economic efficiency. These results indicated that the deposition of Fe2O3 into TiO2 nanotubes significantly enhanced the activity of Fe2O3, which was mainly ascribed to the Fe2O3-induced formation of staggered iron oxides@TiO2 band alignment and thus efficient separation of h+ and e−. Furthermore, the PL intensity and lifetime of the decay curve were considered as key criterions for the activity’s evaluation. Finally, the leaching tests and regeneration experiments were also performed, which illustrated the inhibited photodissolution compared with TiO2/Fe3O4 and stable cycling ability, enabling 1FeTi to be a promising magnetic material for photocatalytic water remediation.",
