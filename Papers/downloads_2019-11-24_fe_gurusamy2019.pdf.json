In this study, biodiesel was produced from Ulva lactuca seaweeds using TiO2–ZnO nanocomposite catalysts with particle size of ~12 nm. The size controlled TiO2–ZnO nanocomposite was characterized by powder XRD analysis and TEM. The result of that TiO2–ZnO catalyst is a promising catalyst for the production of biodiesel under mild reaction conditions and high yield of hydroxydecanoic acid conversion of 82.8%. The various conditions optimized for the higher conversion to FAME (15.8ml of FAME) were 4 wt% catalysts at 4 h under 60 °C and further there is no increase of conversion to FAME above 60 °C–80 °C. The total product yield was calculated as 82.8% of conversion to FAME. The evaluated biodiesel was found to be up to the mark of ASTM standards. The silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized by using leftover biomass of algae obtaining after lipid extraction of U.lactuca. AgNPs particle size was achieved as ~12 nm and was confirmed by UV–Visible spectroscopy, XRD and TEM analysis. Antibacterial activities of the synthesized AgNPs were analyzed and compared. The antibacterial activity was excellent against bacterial pathogens and treatment against P. vulgaris shows the maximum zone of inhibition (13.8mm). The present work identified that the unutilized bioresource such as U.lactuca can be effectively utilized for biodiesel production so as to replace fossil fuel usage."

      "text" : "The energy crisis in India is due to the excessive dependency only on fossil fuel and thereby creates energy scarcity [1]. As the fossil fuel energy resource in India is limited and lack of adaptability for alternative energy policy, it depends on other countries for energy resources. The excessive use of energy will ultimately exhaust fossil fuel resources [2], raise carbon dioxide emission in turn increases the green house effect that is hazardous for the environment, thus demands the\ndevelopment of sustainable energy sources [3]. Potential of biofuels provides energy demands for significant portion of our society's [4]. The production of biodiesel were carried out by various sources such as plants, rapeseed, soybean, sunflower, microalgae, palm, animal fat and were used as an alternative energy sources [5–7]. Algal biomass have large productivity potential, which do not compete for agricultural land, able to withstand different temperature, nutrient concentrations, salinity and farming practices [8]. The numerous researches were focused on microalgae, moreover several species consists of nearly 30%\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2019.02.011 Received 27 January 2019; Received in revised form 20 February 2019; Accepted 26 February 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

All rights reserved.\nT\nlipid on dry weight [9–11]. Notably, some major challenges in microalgae are harvesting and cultivation which leads concern towards seaweeds [12–14]. Seaweeds are having commercially important lipid consisting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) [15], protein, fatty acid contents in higher level, which are biological components with interesting functional properties [16], were commercialized for biomedical, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical properties and about 2400 natural products were reported [17]. Consumption of fuel feedstock such as marine macroalgal species achieves a maximum growth rate comparing terrestrial and water grown biomass [18]. Currently, algal resources have being practiced with interest as an alternative resource of renewable energy feedstock in across the world [19]. Bruhn et al. [20] highlighted the successful usage of Ulva for better growing and biomass producing macro algae in open ocean culture.\nU. lactuca seaweed is not used as human food and having 8.5% of lipid [21], moreover it is abundant, not commercially exploited, and are available at the eastern seashore of the Nambuthalai coastal area of India, so the present work aimed to use U. lactuca for the production of biodiesel and silver nanoparticles.\nMethyl ester production by using basic catalytic methodologies may yield FAME (Fatty acid methyl ester) [22–24]. Lipids can be transesterified from various biological sources in the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts. Product quality and synthesis conditions were improved while using nanocomposites as catalysts [22]. Effective biodiesel transesterification can be achieved by heterogeneous metal oxide catalysts than the usage of homogeneous catalyst [23]. Generally mixed metal oxide nanoparticles has well known surface acidity which acts as a solid catalyst provides higher prolonged catalytic activity in the transesterification process [24]. Heterogeneous TiO2–ZnO nanocomposite catalysts provide higher activity, selectivity, water tolerance properties [25], easier catalytic separation, pollution reduction, low reaction temperature and time. Requiting affordable, selective and stable catalysts occurs a impact in the production process [26]. Divalent metal oxides provide a considerable covalent character which enhances transesterification [25]. ZnO is an amphoteric oxide having capability of transesterifying Free Fatty Acid (FFA) oil at both acid and base sites [27]. In transesterification, high density material like ZnO on TiO2 leads to increase accessibility on FFA, methanol and triglycerides [28]. And particular TiO2 has broad spectrum and attracts with excellent applications gas sensors, medicine, catalyst support, pigments, cosmetics and solar cells, antibacterial, environmental remediation, air purification, water disinfection [28–32]. Optimization was carried out to determine amount of catalyst, oil molar ratio, temperature, and time [33,34]. At present there are no reports that utilized TiO2–ZnO from seaweed lipid. TiO2–ZnO mixed oxide nanocomposite as catalyst for\ntransesterification process was effectively used in transesterification of palm oil into FAME based on glycerol nitrate combustion method [35]. Subramani et al., [36] derived Mn3O4 nanocubes from decomposition of metal hexocyanoferrate by using simple co-precipitation method for super capacitor application. This method is ecofriendly, low cost, less energy consuming, less time consuming and suitable for large-scale synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles. Superior advantages attracted towards the method used by Subramani et al., [36] with other heterogeneous catalyst synthesis methods [35]. The basic lipid extraction techniques were not applicable to attain complete extraction. So it needs formic acid, hydrochloric acids for rupturing tissues, ethanol and chloroform for extracting the solvent [21]. In the present study, TiO2–ZnO nanocatalyst was produced by co-precipitation method and optimization was established using the laboratory scale biodiesel production parameters such as catalyst concentration, temperature and reaction time during transesterification process [33,37].\nDue to the broad spectrum and large surface area nanoscale silver nanoparticles were highlighted as a potential candidate against multiresistant microbes [38,39]. Increasing market prices, safe development, environmental friendly approaches for biogenic production is now in more interest due to the simplicity of the procedures and versatility [38]. Currently, there is a increasing necessitate to develop environmental friendly and sustainable methods for the synthesis of\nnanomaterials without utilizing harmful chemicals in the synthesis protocols, which curtail negative impacts in medical application [40]. The exact reaction mechanism leading to the formation of AgNPs is yet to be elucidated [41] but it is believed that natural products are having\nthe rich amount of alkaloids and flavonoids, consisting large amount of electrons and these electrons were reducing the silver nitrate into AgNPs. In antibacterial activity of AgNPs, the most believed mechanism is interaction between bacterial cell membrane and surface interchange, which cause intercellular leakage leads to cell death [42]. Moreover, Ag+binds to the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits metabolic pathway by which leads to produce reactive oxygen species finally damaging the cells and destroying the DNA replication [43–45]. Considering the importance of silver nanoparticles in the medical field for developing toxic free nanoparticles from biosynthesis, we focused on the economical and effective production of AgNPs using leftover biomass obtained after lipid extraction from U. lactuca."

The XRD patterns suggested in Fig. 1a and b were good agreement with the standard ICDD No: 01–079-0208 for Hexagonal ZnO crystal and ICDD No: 01-084-1750 for the orthorhombic TiO2 system. Fig. 1c exposes both TiO2 and ZnO phases; it clearly indicates the formation of TiO2-ZnO nanocomposite. The broad and high\nintensity peak of tiny particles confirms the amorphous nature of TiO2ZnO nanocomposite with particle size of 12 nm. TiO2 and ZnO with particle size of 11 nm and 10 nm respectively was estimated based on the diffraction reflection by using Debye–Scherrer equation Eq.

The particle size produced in the present study is much smaller (12 nm) than the particle produced by glycerol-nitrate combustion method [35,54]. The FT-IR spectra of TiO2–ZnO mixed oxide nanocomposite was taken in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. Ti-O-Ti stretching vibration was confirmed by the corresponding bands at 664 and 1400 cm−1 [55], While the one found at 1658 cm−1 is equivalent to bending vibration of the H2O and Ti-OH, the peak at 609 cm−1 is due to the presence of ZnO and peak at 460 cm−1 indicates the ZneO vibration [28,55].\nFig. 2 shows a typical TEM image of TiO2-ZnO nanocomposite material which is completely rolled with TiO2 and ZnO like a sandwich. Similarly, TEM image revealed the high magnification of TiO2-ZnO nanocomposite. The SAED pattern of TiO2-ZnO shows that polycrystalline material was present. The EDAX study (Fig. 3) confirms that the nanocomposite is composed of Ti, Zn, Cu and O. The Synthesized TiO2-ZnO catalyst can esterify Free fatty acids from non utilized raw materials and non hazardous material.

      "text" : "In U. lactuca wet algal powder; we were able to achieved lipid extraction of about 8.5%. Yaich et al., [21] obtained 7.9% of lipid from U. lactuca. In the present study, U. lactuca originated from India shown to have same high level of lipid content. In order to find a higher conversion to FAME, different percentages of catalysts (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10wt %) at different reaction temperature (40 °C–80 °C) and time (3–6 h) were tested with constant methanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1. The various conditions optimized for the higher conversion to FAME (15.8ml of FAME) were 4 wt% catalysts at 4 h under 60 °C and further there is no increase of conversion to FAME above 60 °C–80 °C. The role of optimization of oil molar ratio in the reaction is highest mass ratio creates impacts in the methanol and oil molecules so the methyl ester increases methanol to oil mass ratio [56]. Its mandatory to identify the optimized reaction temperature because the temperature must to less than the alcohols boiling point and reaction time was optimized due to identify the relationship between the reaction temperature, time.\nThe total product yield was calculated as 82.8% of conversion to FAME. The same reaction parameters were applied in Mahula oil and they got the related results [33]. Here we have taken unutilized seaweed sample and got better result. Madhuvilakku and Piraman [35]\nalso proved that applying heterogeneous TiO2-ZnO catalyst, achieved a faster reaction rate until 4 h of reaction time. The reusability of the recollected catalyst was accessed and was found to be 100% activity for 3 cycles, later on the activity declined. The conversion of fatty acid methyl ester from U. lactuca algal oil was evaluated by Gas chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy analysis. The extracted lipid dry weight consists of different lipid components, because basically plant and algal species bears some nonpolar triacylglycerols containing fatty acids with phospholipids, sterols and vitamins [57].\nThe FTIR analysis (Fig. 4) was conducted in the mid infrared region to found the functional group, various bending and stretching frequencies of corresponding bands regarding to biodiesel blends [58]. FTIR was characterized on symmetric, asymmetric regions, it shown strong stretching vibrations of alkyl groups on 3404, 2648, 2381, 1411, ester group on 1708 cm−1 and it has been found as typical ester. Moreover alkane group was found at 1220 cm−1. The product obtained from the transesterification was confirmed as biodiesel [35,55].\nFrom the algal oil fatty acid profile by comparing with standard data in GC MS software, we found that saturated fatty acids and poly unsaturated fatty acids (78.2%). Relative quantity of monounsaturated fatty acid profile was found between green algal species [59]. Concentration of oleic acid, octadecenoic was higher in green algae [59]. GC–MS result (Fig. 5) (Table 1) shows the presence of large amounts of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids.\nThe other parameters of produced biodiesel was shown in Table 2, they were in accordance with ASTM standards. Some parameters are not found in ASTM standard methods. So we did European Biodiesel Standards for those parameters.\nDensity of biodiesel was slightly high (0.86%/ml) in our study than the normal diesel (0.83%/ml) [46].\nCatalyst was reused twice as it provides a good catalytic activity and yields same conversion to FAME rate. The occurrence of large amounts of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid shows the good performance of biodiesel conversion from U. lactuca. Excess amount of methanol was added to the above mixture in between the process of transesterification reaction for enhancing the reaction [60,61]."

      "text" : "TiO2-ZnO mixed metal oxide nanocomposite was synthesized using co-precipitation method with particle size of ~12 nm. The process parameters were optimized and higher yield of FAME of hydroxydecanoic acid conversion of 82.8% was obtained from U. lactuca. The solid biomass of U. lactuca after transesterification was effectively used for synthesis of AgNPs as it contains effective reducing and capping agents. The nanoparticles synthesized were spherical and ~24 nm in size, shows to be a promising material with higher antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity was excellent against bacterial pathogens and treatment against P. vulgaris shows the maximum zone of inhibition (13.8mm). The biogenic AgNPs synthesized from U. lactuca extract can be applied as an ingredient in the potential antimicrobial drug formulation."

    "abstractText" : "TiO2-ZnO heterogeneous catalytic system provides a good replacement of a homogeneous catalytic reaction due to its easier recovery. In this study, biodiesel was produced from Ulva lactuca seaweeds using TiO2–ZnO nanocomposite catalysts with particle size of ~12 nm. The size controlled TiO2–ZnO nanocomposite was characterized by powder XRD analysis and TEM. The result of that TiO2–ZnO catalyst is a promising catalyst for the production of biodiesel under mild reaction conditions and high yield of hydroxydecanoic acid conversion of 82.8%. The various conditions optimized for the higher conversion to FAME (15.8ml of FAME) were 4 wt% catalysts at 4 h under 60 °C and further there is no increase of conversion to FAME above 60 °C–80 °C. The total product yield was calculated as 82.8% of conversion to FAME. The evaluated biodiesel was found to be up to the mark of ASTM standards. The silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized by using leftover biomass of algae obtaining after lipid extraction of U.lactuca. AgNPs particle size was achieved as ~12 nm and was confirmed by UV–Visible spectroscopy, XRD and TEM analysis. Antibacterial activities of the synthesized AgNPs were analyzed and compared. The antibacterial activity was excellent against bacterial pathogens and treatment against P. vulgaris shows the maximum zone of inhibition (13.8mm). The present work identified that the unutilized bioresource such as U.lactuca can be effectively utilized for biodiesel production so as to replace fossil fuel usage.",
