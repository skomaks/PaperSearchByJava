Among the latest innovations investigated to enhance the overall performance of this process both qualitatively and quantitatively, the application of some nanoparticles (NPs) has attracted a great deal of attention. Typically, the NPs of potential benefit to the AD process could be divided into three groups: (i) zerovalent iron (ZVI) NPs, (ii) metallic and metal oxides NPs, and (iii) carbon-based NPs. The present review focuses on the latest findings reported on the application of these NPs in AD process and presents their various mechanisms of action leading to higher or lower biogas production rates. Among the NPs studies, ZVI NPs could be regarded as the most promising nanomaterials for enhancing biogas production through stabilizing the AD process as well as by stimulating the growth of beneficial microorganisms to the AD process and the enzymes involved. Future research should focus on various attributes of NPs when used as additives in biogas production, including facilitating mixing and pumping operations, enriching the population and diversity of beneficial microorganisms for AD, improving biogas release, and inducing the production and activity of AD-related enzymes. The higher volume of methane-enriched biogas would be translated into higher returns on investment and could therefore, result in further growth of the biogas production industry. Nevertheless, efforts should be devoted to decreasing the price of NPs so that the enhanced biogas and methane production (by over 90%, compared to control) would be more economically justified, facilitating the large-scale application of these compounds. In addition to economic considerations, environmental issues are also regarded as major constraints which should be addressed prior to widespread implementation of NP-augmented AD processes. More specifically, the fate of NPs augmented in AD process should be scrutinized to ensure maximal beneficial impacts while adverse environmental/health consequences are minimized."

      "text" : "Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a complex microbial process, in which various organic compounds such as animal manures, agricultural residues, food industries waste, and sewage sludge are converted into\nbiogas (Aghbashlo et al., 2019b). The final product, i.e. biogas, constitutes mainly of 60–70% methane (CH4) and 30–40% carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as trace amounts of other gasses such as ammonia (NH3), hydrogen (H2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and water (H2O) vapors (Alawi et al., 2009; Ganzoury and Allam, 2015;\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109597 Received 17 February 2019; Received in revised form 6 September 2019; Accepted 16 September 2019\n∗ Corresponding author.

The process consists of four main steps to decompose organic matters into biogas in an oxygenfree environment. In the first step, i.e. hydrolysis, large polymers such as carbohydrate, proteins, and lipids are broken into smaller organic molecules through the enzymatic action of bacterial communities (Shirzad et al., 2019). The second step, i.e. acidogenesis, involves the conversion of monomers generated in the hydrolysis step into organic acids by acidogenic bacteria. In the third step, i.e. acetogenesis, acetogenic bacteria produce acetic acid, CO2, and H2 from the products of the acidogenic step (Tabatabaei et al., 2019b). This step requires low partial hydrogen pressures to support the growth and metabolism of acetogenic bacteria. The last step is methanogenesis in which acetic acid, CO2, and H2 are converted into methane by the aid of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, belonging to archaea (Angelidaki et al., 2018; Ghodrat et al., 2018; Tabatabaei et al., 2019b). Indeed, acetic acid and H2 are two of the most significant intermediates acting as substrates for methanogenic archaea during the methanogenic assimilation of organic matters (Conrad, 1999). It should also be noted that the simultaneous synthesis of H2 by syntrophic and fermenting bacteria and its consumption by methanogenic archaea determine H2 concentration. Moreover, a Gibbs free energy of −23 kJ/mol CH4 is required for coupling the generation of 1/3 ATP to that of CH4. Below this threshold, the production rate of methane would be decreased or even inhibited, and hydrogen could be, for instance, channeled into completing pathways such as sulfate reduction (Conrad, 1999). A flow diagram of a typical AD process is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nAD is, in fact, a sustainable method not only to protect the environment from wastes but also to produce biogas as renewable energy (Barati et al., 2017; Tabatabaei et al., 2019c). Moreover, the digestate produced upon the completion of the AD process, which is mainly a mixture of solid and liquid substances, can be applied as a high-quality fertilizer to enrich agricultural lands with low organic matters (Aghbashlo et al., 2019a; Rajaeifar et al., 2017). Straight biogas requires a simple economically-viable purification (H2S < 500 ppm, no moisture content, no limitation for CO2) and could be used to generate power (electricity and heat) in combined heat and power plants for use in urban and rural areas, as adapted by many countries (Shirzad et al., 2019; Tabatabaei et al., 2019c). The price of electricity generated through AD depends on the feedstock, technology and equipment involved, size of plant, by-products, as well as managements and policies implemented (Gebrezgabher et al., 2010; Oreggioni et al., 2017; Shirzad et al., 2019). Typically and despite its lower electricity production cost vs. some other techniques such as solar, wind, and hydrothermal gasification, the current AD process is not an economically viable process for green energy production unless its other benefits, for example, mineral fertilizers substitution, bioremediation of inorganic (to some extent) and organic pollution, wastewater treatment, and greenhouse gases mitigation are completely exploited as well (Shirzad et al., 2019; Thi et al., 2016). It should be noted that raw biogas could also be biologically upgraded into more advanced fuels such as\nmethanol (Kazemi Shariat Panahi et al., 2019c). Through this strategy, the major step of conventional biogas purification, i.e., H2S removal would no longer be required leading to saving of approximately USD 0.38/m3 CH4 (Kazemi Shariat Panahi et al., 2019c). Given the various advantages of waste-oriented biogas production, a great deal of research is focused on further advancing this field by introducing a wide range of innovative approaches.\nAlong with different recently-introduced innovations such as biogas production under integrated biofuels production schemes (i.e., biorefinery concept), bioaugmentation, anaerobic co-digestion, etc. (Kazemi Shariat Panahi et al., 2019b,c,d; Tabatabaei et al., 2019b,c),The application of nanoparticles (NPs) is also receiving increasing attention due to their remarkable properties such as extremely small size, variety in morphology, high reactivity, and chemical stability (Rahimzadeh et al., 2018; Sekoai et al., 2019; Tabatabaei et al., 2019c). Additionally, NPs have high surface area to volume ratios increasing the number of active sites available, an essential attribute for proceeding reactions of different types. For instance, NPs can facilitate hydrolysis processes by providing a large surface area to volume ratio for microorganisms to attach the active sites of organic molecules (Hsieh et al., 2016). Alternatively, NPs could also function as electron donors/acceptors and cofactor of important enzymes involved in various bioprocesses enhancing their yields.\nThe term nanotechnology first coined by Richard Feynman in his 1959 talk at the American Physical Society meeting (Feynman, 1959). In the following years, a rolled up sheet of carbon in tubular structure, called Fullerences/Buckyballs, was discovered. Twenty one years after the Feynman's famous talk about nanotechnology, Eric Drexler published probably the first scientific paper dealing with molecular engineering (Drexler, 1981). In 1986, he published an influential book introducing fundamentals of nanotechnology (Eric, 1986). Intriguingly, Drexler was the first teacher presenting a formal course on nanotechnology in 1988 and was the first student who received a PhD in molecular nanotechnology in 1991 as well. Nanotechnology could be defined as research and development at the atomic scale of 1–100 nm for measuring and manipulating matters to obtain fundamentally different chemical, physical, and biological characteristics, compared to their corresponding bulk materials.\nDespite huge efforts devoted to the application of nanoparticles in different fields including remediation of various pollution from soil and water (Chowdhury and Yanful, 2010; Jorfi et al., 2016; VitelaRodriguez and Rangel-Mendez, 2013), its potential application in biogas industry has remained largely unattended. In one of the first study, Scott (2006) described the general potentials of unmentioned NPs for enhancing biogas production from animal manures. However, it was only in 2011 that the impact of particle size of some metal oxide (CuO, ZnO) on methane and biogas production in AD process was evaluated for the first time (Luna-delRisco et al., 2011). In the subsequent year, researchers noticed the accumulation of NPs in municipal wastes due to increasing applications of these compounds in various industries. This triggered investigations into the potential effects of various metallic and metal oxide NPs on AD of municipal sludge in the same year. Preliminary investigations showed that, at certain concentrations, some NPs (e.g., Ag and TiO2) exert no harmful effects on AD process with respect to methane and biogas productions, as well on the microorganisms population involved in AD and their diversity whereas others (Au, CeO2) could negatively impact this process (García et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012a, 2012b). The study of the impacts of NPs on AD continued in following years and some other NPs (such as ZVI, CuO, ZnO, CeO2, Cu0, TiO2) were also investigated (Carpenter et al., 2015; Eduok, 2015; Gonzalez-Estrella et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2015; OteroGonzalez et al., 2014b; Yang et al., 2013a, 2013b; Zheng et al., 2015). In light of the above, this review presents the state-of-the-art of the application of various nanomaterials used to enhance/improve biogas production via AD process with a focus on the studies conducted most recently. NPs covered in the present review are categorized into three\nsubclasses; (i) zero-valent metal NPs, (ii) metallic and metal oxides NPs, and (iii) carbon-based NPs. Techno-economic and environmental analysis of NPs on biogas production along with practical implications of this study is discussed in detail."

      "heading" : "2.1. Zero-valent iron NPs/nano zero-valent iron",
      "text" : "Zero-valent Iron (ZVI) NPs have been characterized as a proper lowrelease electron donor (i.e., Fe2+) during the methanogenesis process leading to enhanced biogas production yields (Ma et al., 2015). These NPs could also participate in the synthesis of microbial key enzymes that are essential for the AD process (Fig. 2). For example, the activity of coenzyme F420 increases in the presence of ZVI NPs, because Fe2+ is an essential part of this coenzyme (Ma et al., 2015). Similarly, in a different study (Wang et al., 2016) the addition of 10mg ZVI NPs/g total suspended solids enhanced methane production by up to 120% during a 30-d fermentation process as compared to the control (180.96 mL/g volatile suspended solids, VSS).\nIt has been reported that ZVI NPs were capable of optimizing the microbial population and consequently, enhancing hydrolysis fermentation (Ganzoury and Allam, 2015) (Fig. 2). More specifically, the strong reductant property of iron could facilitate hydrolysis-acidification steps; the rate-limiting steps throughout AD (Ganzoury and Allam, 2015). In better words, at certain concentrations, ZVI NPs act in favor of the microorganisms responsible for hydrolysis-acidification processes\nthrough enriching organic load i.e., disrupting the cell membrane of the other microorganisms that are comparatively more susceptible. This lysis phenomenon leads to the release of a considerable deal of proteins and celluloses, further stimulating the growth of hydrolyzing-acidifying populations (Wang et al., 2018). From the mechanism point of view, the disruption of the membranes is due to the direct interaction of ZVI NPs with microbial cells rendering reductive decomposition of functional groups in lipopolysaccharides and proteins of the outer membranes (Wang et al., 2018). However, it should be noted that higher concentrations of Fe2+ could also inhibit the methanogenesis probably through a similar mechanism i.e., disruption of cell integrity. This could justify the conflicting results obtained in some studies (lacking anaerobic granular sludge, AGS) with lower methane production in response to the application of ≥1mM ZVI NPs (Cerri et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2013a).\nIn addition to the above, the dissolution of ZVI NPs in water releases H2 (Huang et al., 2016). This phenomenon may exert negative or positive effects on methane production yield by enriching hydrogenotrophic bacteria or acting as an electron donor for hydrogenotrophic archaea for methane production, respectively (Cerri et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2013a) (Fig. 2). More specifically, rapid H2 release decreases methane production whereas its slow release improves its production (Cerri et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2013a). Intriguingly, the presence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the substrate could improve methane production through inhibition of H2 generation as well as through protecting microorganisms against toxicity (Cerri et al., 2017).\nEnhancement of biogas production in the presence of ZVI NPs could also be attributed to their influence on the physical and chemical properties of the environment surrounding methanogenic microorganisms by controlling pH, ammonia nitrogen concentration, and volatile fatty acids content (Fig. 2). The impacts exerted through pH modification could be ascribed to the oxidation of Fe0 to Fe2+ by water or some organic compounds as an oxidant during the AD process generating iron oxide or covering the surface of NPs by oxyhydroxide (Li et al., 2007; Suanon et al., 2017). It should be noted that iron oxide and oxyhydroxide could also be produced through reaction of ZVI NPs with some other compounds present in the AD process including chlorinated pesticides, H2S, toxic metal ions (such as lead and mercury), and methyl sulfides (Li et al., 2007). These could donate an additional buffering capacity to the system against volatile fatty acids produced. ZVI NPs could also stimulate hydrogen-consuming microorganisms and the consumption of the produced volatile fatty acids (Suanon et al., 2017). Moreover, there is an inverse relationship between the amount of ammonia nitrogen and pH value in AD (Suanon et al., 2017). It is worth mentioning that ammonia nitrogen could be adsorbed by the oxyhydroxide generated in the presence of ZVI NPs (Suanon et al., 2017). On this basis, Jia et al. (2017) added various concentrations of ZVI NPs (1–4 g/L) with average diameter sizes of 50–70 nm to biogas production reactors. Optimum performance parameters such as biogas production volume (> 600mL), methane content (68.75%), and ammonia nitrogen (< 600mg/L) were associated with 1 g/L ZVI NPs. The authors concluded that cumulative (35 d) biogas production and methane content were respectively enhanced by 18.11% and 6.93% in the presence of ZVI NPs in comparison with the control (biogas, ~500mL; methane content, ~61%).\nZVI NPs can lower H2S content through the formation of nonvolatile and stable superficial complexes and could, therefore, improve the quality and quantity of the biogas produced (Li et al., 2007). The mechanism of removal include, for instance, impacts of ZVI NPs on AD of sewage sludge, methane production, and COD under mesophilic temperature (Suanon et al., 2017). The presence of ZVI NPs (0.1 wt%) respectively enhanced COD removal, methane production, and methane content by 17.8%, 25.2%, and 3.1%, improving the control values for the mentioned parameters from 44.6% (2968mg/L), 8563.9 mL/kg VSS, and about 70.3%–54.4% (3618.9 mg/L), 9108.2 mL/kg VSS, and 73.4% within 30 d of AD process (Suanon et al., 2017). In their study, ZVI NPs were also used to treat high-concentration (10,000 ppm) H2S biogas in a fixed-bed reactor. The H2S removal capacity of ZVI NPs was recorded at 12.56 and 14.77mg H2S/g ZVI NPs at room temperature and 100 °C, respectively. The capacity was significantly increased to 391.02 and 488.95mg H2S/g ZVI NPs at elevated temperatures of 200 °C and 250 °C, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the removal of impurities such as CO, H2S, and NH3 from biogas is critical in improving the economic profitability of the process by both increasing the quality of the biogas generated and by protecting the equipment from corrosion (Achinas et al., 2017; Sahota et al., 2018).\nCompared to floc sludge, AGS plays a critical function in AD systems (Cerri et al., 2017). These granules have a three-layered structure: (i) the outer layer that is highly heterogeneous, consisting of hydrogenotrophic methanogens archaea, as well as syntrophic and fermentative eubacteria; (ii) the middle layer with lower heterogeneity than the outer layer; and (iii) the internal core consisting of large populations of Methanothrix-like cells (Cerri et al., 2017). Cerri et al. (2017) investigated the effect of ZVI NPs on the stability of AGS, fate, and distribution of Fe2+, and modification of microbial diversity. They achieved 30% more methane production by enriching the reaction mixture with 30mmol/L ZVI NPs. At this concentration, insignificant increases in chemical oxygen demand (COD) revealed that granular sludge cells were not completely disrupted when they came into direct contact with ZVI NPs. Microscopic analysis of iron particles distribution in sludge also showed that ZVI NPs have mostly attached on the AGS surface as well as EPS in the form of iron oxides, rather than entering\ninto its inner side. This behavior could protect methanogens against the toxic effects of ZVI NPs. Interestingly, in the same study, it was found that ZVI NPs could significantly enrich phylum Thermotogae and genera Methanobacterium while discouraging the growth of Chloroflexi and class Methanomicrobia. The increase in Methanobacteria was due to the availability of higher amounts of H2 triggered by the decreased population of Chloroflexi (disruption of the cell membrane) in the presence of ZVI NPs (Krakat et al., 2011). Increases in the abundance of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria in the presence of ZVI NPs were also observed by Wang et al. (2018)."

      "text" : "Some trace metal elements such as Co, Cu, Fe, Mo, and Ni could play significant roles in stimulation as well as stabilization of AD of waste organic materials when they are present at low concentrations (Abdelsalam et al., 2016; Luna-delRisco et al., 2011). In fact, the presence of these heavy metal ions is essential for enzymes and cofactors and is fundamental for various reactions taking place during AD. More specifically, cobalt is essential (as protein cofactor of vitamin B12) for degradation of methanol by methanogenic bacteria whereas methanogenic archaea need nickel as their coenzyme F430 (Roussel, 2013). Zinc plays key roles in enzymes (e.g., as methyl coenzyme M) and as structural ions in transesterification factor while copper is essential for coenzyme and biological electron transport (Bartacek et al., 2008; Fermoso et al., 2008; Metcalf, 2003). Finally, Fe is required for proper growth and activities of AD microorganisms by acting as oxidation-reduction agent, co-enzyme, and terminal electron acceptor (Roussel, 2013). Therefore, given the unique properties of nanomaterials, the application of these elements in nano range size has attracted a great deal of attention. For instance, Abdelsalam et al. (2016) studied the effect of Co and Ni NPs on AD of cattle dung slurry in a batch system. Compared to the control (biogas, 26.7 L; methane, 13 L), the treatment of feedstock with Co (1mg/L), Fe (20mg/L), Fe3O4 (20mg/L), and Ni (2mg/L) NPs increased both cumulative biogas production (1.7, 1.5, 1.7, and 1.8 times, respectively) and methane production (2, 1.67, 2.16, and 1.86 and 2.17 times, respectively) through 40 d hydraulic retention time. Moreover, the addition of these NPs reduced the lag phase time required to reach the production peak of biogas and methane.\nAli et al. (2017) studied the impact of Fe3O4 NPs on AD of municipal solid waste under the mesophilic condition for 60 d of reaction time at different concentrations (50–125mg/L) and particle sizes (15–22 nm). The maximum yield of methane (5000mL) was obtained at 75mg/L of NPs whereas any further increases in the concentration of NPs reduced methane production. In another study, Noonari et al. (2018) reported a relatively similar concentration of magnetic Fe3O4 NPs (81mg/L) for optimum methane production (256.0 mLCH4/gVS) through co-digestion of canola straw and banana waste plant with buffalo dung under mesophilic conditions for 40 d. Chen et al. (2018) examined the role of Fe3O4 NPs as iron releasing agent on the growth of methanogen Methanosarcina barkeri. The tubes containing Difco Sporulation Medium 120 medium was supplemented with 0–20 ppm of Fe3O4 NPs (with a mean size of 8.1 ± 2.4 nm) and degassed using deoxygenized gas pressure injector before inoculation of M. barkeri. The amount of Fe2+ released from 20 ppm Fe3O4 during the first 6 h was 10 μM and kept gradually increasing. Methane production in the presence of NPs significantly increased (up to 60%) as compared to the control of iron-free medium. The authors also claimed that the addition of methanol (as a substrate) had an immediate and synergistic effect on the rate of methane production, compared to the medium supplemented with Fe3O4 NPs alone. This could be ascribed to the increasing number of methanogens in the last step in response to the addition of a readily available substrate like methanol to an enzymatically active environment caused by Fe3O4 NPs.\nOverall, these improvements in biogas production could be due to the vital effect of metal ions (such as Fe2+ and Fe3+) on the growth of\nanaerobic microbial populations as well as decreasing the lag time in AD process (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the application of Fe3O4 NPs could facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer during the syntrophic methanogensis (Ali et al., 2017) (Fig. 3). In contrast, it should be noted that these metal oxides could also inhibit methanogenesis by mainly acting on acetoclastic methanogens at elevated concentrations (Otero-Gonzalez et al., 2014a). For example, CuO and Fe2O3 NPs reportedly led to decreased methane production by suppressing acetoclastic methanogenes and H2-consuming methanogens, respectively. High concentrations of both CeO2 and Mn2O3 NPs have been associated with the inhibition of both groups of methanogens (Otero-Gonzalez et al., 2014a).\nContrary to the above-mentioned metallic and metal oxide NPs that have been shown to exert positive impacts at certain concentrations, NPs containing Cr, Cd, and Zn have been associated with interference with biogas production (Fig. 3). These metal species could inhibit or kill microorganisms involved in AD and could, therefore, suppress the whole process. The cellular mechanisms may be through adverse modification of membrane properties of microorganisms and/or stimulation of oxidative stress (Hamedi et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2013b). The latter route is less common in AD as metal oxides need either oxygen or illumination to produce reactive oxygen species. Temizel et al. (2017) investigated the long-term effect of nano-ZnO (100mg/kg of dry waste) on the digestion of municipal solid waste in both conventional and bioreactor manners. Up to 15% reduction in biogas production in the presence of ZnO in both conventional and bioreactor modes were observed probably due to the inhibitory effect of ZnO on methanogenic microorganisms. Moreover, approximately 99% of the ZnO could persist in the waste matrix for a long-term period with still unclear fate and impact on the environment. In another study by Mu et al. (2011), it was concluded that the inhibitory effect of ZnO NPs on biogas production was concentration dependent with 6 mg/g-total suspended solids not influence methane production. The activity of coenzymes F420 dropped to 66.2%, 89.8%, and 99.3% of the control in the presence 150, 30, and 1mg ZnO NPs/g total suspended solids, respectively (Mu et al., 2011). It has also been shown that ZnO had no considerable improving effect on solubilization and acidification steps\n(Mu et al., 2012). The long-term effect of CuO NPs (37 nm, 1.4mg/L, 43 d) on AD of AGS was studied by Otero-Gonzalez et al. (2014b). Based on the results obtained, methane production was reduced to 85% of the control in the presence of CuO NPs mainly due to the inhibition of acetoclastic methanogens rather than H2-consuming methanogens, a similar mechanism observed during biogas reduction by ZnO NPs (Otero-Gonzalez et al., 2014a, b). The negative impacts of both of NPs mentioned above (i.e., CuO, ZnO) on methane production were also reported by LunadelRisco et al. (2011), highlighting their toxic effects on anaerobic microbes involved in the AD process. In their study, the application of 120mg/L of CuO or ZnO significantly reduced biogas production in a 14-d AD process at 36 °C. Although the study emphasized that the adaptation of microorganisms to these NPs and/or removal of the NPs from the medium, for example, by microbial bioremediation/bioadsorption led to some improvements over the last days of the experiment.\nThe impact of NPs on AD highly depends on their size as well. More specifically, smaller-sized NPs are reportedly more favorable (Nel et al., 2006). The existing literature has proved enhancement of biogas production and methane content in the presence of metallic and metal oxides NPs such as Ni, Co, Fe, Fe3O4, Fe2O3, MgO, and Al2O3, however, there are reports highlighting the inhibitory effect of NPs such as ZnO and TiO2 on the biogas production process when used at higher concentrations."

      "heading" : "2.3. Carbon-based nanomaterials",
      "text" : "All nanocompounds with carbon atoms in their structures are considered as carbon-based nanomaterials. These compounds are classified mainly based on their geometrical structure. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and fullerenes are the most significant carbon nanomaterials of various industrial applications (Zaytseva and Neumann, 2016). Among the carbon-based nanomaterials, CNTs have been introduced into a wide range of applications due to their remarkable thermal, mechanical, electronic, and adsorption features (Rahimzadeh et al., 2018; Shojaei et al., 2019; Zaytseva and Neumann, 2016). Similarly, their potential applications in renewable energy and biogas production\nhave also been investigated recently (Ambuchi et al., 2016; Rahimzadeh et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). Nevertheless, there are still no accurate information on the risks associated with their release into the environment and their interactions with the living organisms.\nSingle-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) could facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) during the AD process. Compared to the control, the rates of feedstock consumption and methane production were speeded up in response to the addition of SWCNTs but methane production yield remained unchanged (~14mL after 180 h) (Li et al., 2015). In fact, DIET allows microorganisms to directly exchange electrons apart from formate or hydrogen transfer (Ambuchi et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2017). In light of that, materials with electrical conduction (such as SWCNTs) could serve as conduits between electronaccepting and electron-donating microbes (i.e., exoelectrogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea) during the DIET process (Li et al., 2015; Park et al., 2018). Intriguingly, methane production is more efficiently promoted in the presence of conductive materials allowing DIET than H2 or other electron carriers consumed as interspecies electron transfer (Park et al., 2018).\nAnother electrically conductive material is multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) that could enhance biogas and methane production rates by transferring electrons toward methanogens (Ambuchi et al., 2017). Generally, CNTs could noticeably enrich electroactive bacteria such as Caloramator sp. or Geobacter sp. along with other bacteria or methanogenic archaea (Methanosarcina, Methanosaeta, etc.) (Ambuchi et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2017). For example, MWCNTs could enrich bacterial community and growth with the two of the top largest phyla affected the most, i.e., Bacteroidetes (11.2%) and Firmicutes (8.4%) (Ambuchi et al., 2017). Ambuchi et al. (2016) studied the effect of MWCNTs on the AD of granular sludge obtained from the beer industry under the mesophilic condition for 96 h. The results showed that after the termination of the experimental period, the cumulative CH4 production was higher in the presence of 1500mg/L of MWCNTs as compared to the control (151.8 vs. 106mL/g volatile-suspended solids). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the sludge granules sampled from the bioreactor treated with MWCNTs had a denser aggregation of microorganisms due to a probable interaction between MWCNTs, microbes, and microbial EPS. In a more recent study, Wang et al. (2018) studied the long-term effect of MWCNTs on the activity and structure of the microbial community in AGS for 110 d. Although MWCNTs did not show a significant influence on biogas production and COD reduction, it increased the removal of total phosphorus by 29.34%. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that MWCNTs had no effect on microbial diversity but changed the composition and structure of microorganisms. For example, in the presence of MWCNTs, Saccharibacteria replaced Proteobacteria suggesting the probable adverse effect of MWCNTs on specific microbial populations.\nThe ash-based nanomaterial is another choice of carbon-based additives for enhancing biogas production. Lo et al. (2012) obtained micro/nano fly ash and micro/nano bottom ash from a municipal solid waste incinerator and applied them for enhancing biogas production. A considerable increase in biogas production was observed in the presence of different concentrations of these ashes during a 90-d AD at 35 °C. This observation could be attributed to the expanding habitats of anaerobic microorganisms caused by the agglomeration nature of these nano-compounds (Lo et al., 2012). The long-term application of fullerene (C60) NPs was shown to have no improving effects on biogas production (Nyberg et al., 2008).\nA summary of the effects of different NPs on the biogas production process is presented in Table 1."

      "text" : "The application of NPs is generally beneficial in terms of accurate dosing of ions capable of enhancing AD process leading to higher biogas production. However, the large-scale application of NPs could trigger some concerns (Gottschalk et al., 2013). More specifically, apart from the cost involved, such large-scale applications could raise environmental and health-related complications. Unfortunately, these complications of NPs such as ZVI NPs in the AD process and biogas production have not been yet considered in detail. In fact, there are currently no universal and effective guidelines available in the field of NPs-enhanced AD processes at an industrial scale (see Section 3.3). The establishment of such guidelines could facilitate the application of these beneficial additives to enhance the conversion of various organic materials including waste streams into biogas via AD process. These guidelines should also encompass environmental, economic, and technical (e.g., preventing inhibitory effects) aspects of NPs applications.\nIf the constraints mentioned above were overcome, among the NPs investigated so far, the most promising NPs for enhancing biogas production would be ZVI NPs. In fact, they could directly or indirectly render positive effects on biogas-producing microorganisms during the AD process when applied at appropriate concentrations. In summary, their mechanisms of action may be through (i) low release of Fe ions, (ii) direct interaction with membranes of susceptible non-biogas producing microorganisms, (iii) release of H2, and (iv) improving the physicochemical characteristics of the AD environment. As mentioned earlier, Fe2+ is an essential trace element for both microorganisms growth involved in the AD as well as for their enzymes activity. In fact, AD-related microorganisms are capable of tolerating somewhat higher concentrations of Fe2+ and ZVI NPs than the AD-contaminating microorganisms. As a result of the degradation of non-favorable microorganisms, more nutrients (proteins, cellulose) are provided for biogas formation, and the microbial population is also regulated. Moreover, this process leads to optimization of microbial diversity as well as modification of hydrolysis fermentation. Slow release of H2 could positively contribute to methane production by acting as an electron donor for hydrogenotrophic methanogens. As elaborated earlier, compounds such as ammonia nitrogen, H2S, heavy metals, volatile fatty acids on the one hand and pH, on the other hand, exert direct effects on biogas production. At specific concentrations, ZVI NPs is capable of adsorbing and remediating some of these compounds, decrease their production, and/or increase their degradation. It can also act as a good buffering agent maintaining pH within a suitable range for AD-related microorganisms.\nFrom the techno-economic point of view, NPs can be synthesized from readily available chemicals with minimum infrastructure (Faisal et al., 2019). The technology involved in NPs production is also wellknown but their impacts on biogas production during AD process still need further assessments. The concentration, time of addition, and particle size determine the effects of NPs, i.e., inhibition, enhancement, etc. on this process (Faisal et al., 2019). Generally, smaller particle size and higher surface area to volume increase the effects of NPs. AD process coupled with appropriate NPs dosing, type, and addition time could assist with achieving an enhanced biogas production process.\nCase study. In order to understand the potential economic impacts of NPs augmentation during the AD process, a case study was designed according to the data available in the literature. More specifically, the techno-economic analysis of two mesophilic (20–40 °C, optimum at 35 °C) farm-scale (i.e., 3670m3) AD scenarios for combined heat and power energy (CHP) generation was considered. One scenario included conventional biogas production from biomass (agricultural residues), manure, glycerol defined as BMG scenario without no NPs addition, whereas the other scenario involved NPs (ZVI) augmentation under\nTa bl e 1 A su m m ar y of\nth e eff\nec ts\nof N Ps\non th e bi og\nas pr od\nuc ti on\npr oc\nes s.\nN an\nop ar ti cl e ty pe\nC on\nce nt ra ti on\nof N P\nFe ed\nst oc\nk R ea ct io n ti m e\nBi og\nas /M\net ha\nne yi el d (c om\npa re d to\nco nt ro l)\nR ef er en\nce (s )\nZV I N Ps\nZV I N Ps\n15 an\nd 30\nm m ol /L\nG ra nu\nla r sl ud\nge 25\n0 h\n7. 45\nm m ol\nC H 4 at\n30 m m ol /L\nZV I N PS\n(C on\ntr ol :5\n.7 4 m m ol\nC H 4 )\nC er ri\net al .( 20\n17 )\n1. 1 g V SS /L ZV I N Ps 10 an d 30 m M M un ic ip al\nsl ud\nge 14\nd 98\nm L m et ha\nne vo\nlu m e at\n10 m M\nN Ps\n(− 20\n.3 % )\nY an\ng et\nal .( 20\n13 b)\n38 m L m et ha\nne vo\nlu m e at\n30 m M\nN Ps\n(− 69\n% )\n(C on\ntr ol\nm et ha\nne vo\nlu m e of\n12 3 m L)\nZV I N Ps\n0. 10\nw t%\nM un\nic ip al\nsl ud\nge 17\nd 5. 1–\n13 .2 %\nm et ha\nne co\nnt en\nt im\npr ov\nem en\nt Su\net al .( 20\n13 )\n22 .2\nL cu\nm ul at iv e bi og\nas vo\nlu m e (+\n30 .4 % )\n13 .7\nL cu\nm ul at iv e m et ha\nne vo\nlu m e (+\n40 .4 % )\n(R es pe\nct iv e co\nnt ro l cu\nm ul at iv e bi og\nas an\nd m et ha\nne vo\nlu m es of 15 .4 6 L an d 8. 16\nL) cZ V I N Ps 2. 5 an d 5 g/ L Br ew er y w as te w at er 10 d 18 2 m L m et ha\nne pr od\nuc ti on\n(+ 28\n% )\nC ar pe\nnt er\net al .( 20\n15 )\n(C on\ntr ol\nm et ha\nne pr od\nuc ti on\nof 14\n2. 19\nm L)\nZV I N Ps\n10 m g/\ng to ta l su sp en\nde d so lid\ns M un\nic ip al\nsl ud\nge 30\nd 21\n7. 16\nm L/\nV SS\nm et ha\nne pr od\nuc ti on\n(+ 12\n0% )\nW an\ng et\nal .( 20\n16 )\n(C on\ntr ol\nm et ha\nne pr od\nuc ti on\nof 18\n0. 97\nm L/\nV SS ) ZV I N Ps 10 00 m g/ L M un ic ip al sl ud ge 35 d 6. 93 % m et ha ne co nt en t im pr ov em en\nt Ji a et\nal .( 20\n17 )\n> 60\n0 m L of\nbi og\nas vo\nlu m e (+\n18 .1 1% ) (C on tr ol : 50 0 m L of bi og as ;6 1% m et ha\nne co\nnt en t) ZV I N Ps 0. 1 w t% M un ic ip al sl ud ge 30 d + 3. 1% m et ha ne co nt en t im pr ov em en\nt Su\nan on\net al .( 20\n17 )\n91 08\n.2 m L/\nkg V SS\nm et ha\nne pr od\nuc ti on\n(C on\ntr ol\nm et ha\nne pr od\nuc ti on\nof 85\n63 .9\nm L/\nkg V SS ) ZV I N Ps ,I M Z, IC Z 50 0 an d 10 00 m g/ L D om es ti c sl ud ge 14 d > 80 0 m L of bi og as at IC Z 10 00 m g/\nL A m en\net al .( 20\n17 )\nTS :1\n.6 4%\n;V S:\n74 .9 % ;C\nO D :\n38 73\nm g/\nL >\n70 0 m L of\nbi og\nas at\nZV I N PS\n10 00\nm g/ L > 60 0 m L of bi og as at IM Z 50 0 m g/ L (C on tr ol bi og as vo lu m e of < 15 0 m L)\nC op\npe r ir on\n-b as ed\nbi m et al lic\n(Z V I\nN Ps /C\nu° )\n10 0,\n25 0,\n50 0,\n15 00\nan d 30\n00 m g/\nL M un\nic ip al\nsl ud\nge 14\nd 69\n3 m L of\nbi og\nas at\n15 00\nm g/\nL N Ps\n(+ 20\n2. 62\n% )\nA m en\net al .( 20\n18 )\nTS :4\n.2 2%\n;O C :7\n2. 8%\n;C O D :\n54 53\nm g/\nL (C\non tr ol\nbi og\nas vo\nlu m e of\n22 9 m L)\nZV I N Ps\n10 0,\n25 0,\n50 0,\n15 00\nan d 30\n00 m g/\nL M un\nic ip al\nsl ud\nge 14\nd 47\n7 m L of\nbi og\nas at\n30 00\nm g/\nL (+\n20 8. 29\n) A m en\net al .( 20\n18 )\nTS :4\n.2 2%\n;O C :7\n2. 8%\n;C O D :\n54 53\nm g/\nL (C\non tr ol\nbi og\nas vo\nlu m e of\n22 9 m L)\nM et al\nan d m et al\nox id e N Ps\nA g\nU p to\n40 m g/\nL M un\nic ip al\nsl ud\nge 20\n–3 0 d\nN o si gn\nifi ca nt\neff ec t (1 84\nm L of\nm et ha\nne an\nd ~ 40\n0 m L of\nbi og\nas )\nY an\ng et\nal .( 20\n12 a)\n(C on\ntr ol\nbi og\nas an\nd m et ha\nne vo\nlu m es\nof ~ 40\n0 m L an\nd <\n19 0 m L,\nre sp ec ti ve\nly )\nA g\n10 m g/\nkg M un\nic ip al\nso lid\nw as te\n20 0 d\n27 .2\nL of\nm et ha\nne vo\nlu m e (−\n80 % )\nY an\ng et\nal .( 20\n13 a)\n(C on\ntr ol\nm et ha\nne vo\nlu m e of\n~ 12\n0. 2 L)\nA g\nN M\nC el lu lo se\n50 d\nN o si gn\nifi ca nt\neff ec t (~\n38 0 m L/\ng V SS\nof bi og\nas )\nG ar cí a et\nal .( 20\n12 )\n(C on\ntr ol\nbi og\nas vo\nlu m e of\n~ 39\n0 m L/\ng V SS ) C eO 2 10 m g/ L M un ic ip al sl ud ge 40 d ~ 18 00 m L of bi og as vo lu m e (1 1%\n) N gu\nye n et\nal .( 20\n15 )\n(C on\ntr ol\nbi og\nas vo\nlu m e of\n~ 16\n00 m L)\nC eO\n2 N M\nC el lu lo se\n50 d\n~ 40\nm L/\ng V SS\nof bi og\nas vo\nlu m e (−\n90 % )\nG ar cí a et\nal .( 20\n12 )\n(C on\ntr ol\nbi og\nas vo\nlu m e of\n~ 39\n0 m L/\ng V SS ) Ti O 2 N M C el lu lo se 50 d ~ 43 0 m L/ g V SS of bi og as vo lu m e (+ 10 % )\nG ar cí a et\nal .( 20\n12 )\n(C on\ntr ol\nbi og\nas vo\nlu m e of\n~ 39\n0 m L/\ng V SS ) C uO 1. 4 m g C u/ L M un ic ip al w as te w at er 10 7 d > -5 0% in m et ha\nne (O\nte ro -G\non za le z et\nal ., 20\n14 b)\nC uO\n10 .7\nm g\nC at tl e m an\nur e\n14 d\n− 50\n% in\nm et ha\nne Lu\nna -d el R is co\net al .( 20\n11 )\nC o,\nN i, Fe\n,F e 3 O 4\nC o:\n1 m g/\nL;

The AD plants were assumed to be co-located with a cattle feedlot with a target digester input of 90MT. The process model of the system is illustrated inFig. 4.\nThe data for this model process were adapted from Aui et al. (2019) with some modifications and included a feedlot with 2400 beef cattle and two AD plants with 3670m3 capacities. The AD process is completed in six technical areas including feedstock pre-processing, feedstock pretreatment, feedstocks mixing, AD, by-products (liquid digestate, 2 wt% organic matter; solid digestate, 28 wt% organic matter) separation, and steam and power generation (Aui et al., 2019). The feedstocks (9 wt% total suspended solids) used in this wet digestion process consisted of biomass (such as rye, wheat, corn stover, etc.) and cattle manure, supplemented with glycerol to obtain a final ratio of 10.15:79.85:10 wt%, respectively. This cheap supplement (i.e., crude glycerol), which is infinitely available as by-product of biodiesel industry, could enhance both biogas yield and methane content due to its high amount of easily degradable COD for anaerobic microorganisms (Kazemi Shariat Panahi et al., 2019d; Robra et al., 2010; Tabatabaei et al., 2019b). Regardless of the type of feedstock, the addition of ZVI NPs (typically, 0.1 wt%) has been proven to enhance biogas yield (18.11–366.7%, typical average of 50.3%) and methane content (3.1–120%, typical average of 40.1%) (Table 1) (Carpenter et al., 2015; Cerri et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2017; Su et al., 2013; Suanon et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016), through the mechanisms discussed in Section 2. The selection of mesophilic process was due to its higher stability (over thermophilic processes) as well as its common application for largescale AD plants (Abbasi et al., 2012; Aui et al., 2019; Baldwin et al., 2009). The results were fortified by incorporation of a conservative generation potential value (power efficiency) of 42% and operating capacity of 85%, corresponding to the traditional low-efficient farmscale AD plants (Aui et al., 2019; Klavon et al., 2013).\nThe data related to BMG scenario was obtained from the technoeconomic analysis (including capital and operating costs) conducted by Aui et al. (2019). They used a modified analysis version originally developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, i.e., the multiyear discounted cash flow rate of return. Mixers, reactors, anaerobic digesters, storages tanks, pumps, heat exchangers, and CHP units were the considered equipment. The costs of these equipment, together with installation costs, land expenses, and indirect costs (e.g legal fees, engineering design) constituted the capital cost (estimated at 3.12 million USD) (Aui et al., 2019). For the NPA scenario, it was assumed that no step was involved for separation of unreacted NPs from the distillate. Therefore, both scenarios shared the same capital costs. However, the main (operating) cost difference between these scenarios was the NPs cost in the NAP scenario. NPs transportation cost was excluded due to low concentration of ZVI NPs required (0.1 wt%). The feedstock cost (i.e.,manure, biomass, and glycerol) for both scenarios was estimated at 25 USD/MT with 5 USD/MT solids handling costs (Aui et al., 2019). Plant life time of 30 yrs; construction period of 2.5 yrs; equity of 40%; depreciation period of 7 yrs; start-up time of 6 months; working capital of 15% of Fixed Capital Cost; interest rate for financing of 7.5%/yr;\nincome tax rate of 39%; and electricity price of 0.064 USD/kWh were some key financial assumptions considered through the design of this case study (Humbird et al., 2011). Upon the completion of AD process, 0.015 USD/kWhe (Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit), 35.25 USD/MT solid digestate, and 2.64 USD/MT liquid digestate could be gained (Aui et al., 2019).\nAccording to the calculations performed by Aui et al. (2019), about 8335m3/d of biogas could be generated from a 90MT of digester input in the BMG scenario, leaving 80MT of digestate. The electricity power of 950 kW could be assumed with a gas turbine power efficiency of 42%. While the NPA scenario could provide about 1809 kWe (about 90.4% more electricity) if enhanced biogas and methane content of 50.3% and 40.1% were assumed in the presence of 0.1 wt% ZVI NPs. Unfortunately, there is no data available on the ratio of digester input to digestate (DItD) as well as digestate quality when ZVI NPs are augmented into AD process. Therefore, to simplify the calculations, we assumed the same ratio of DItD (i.e., 1.125) in both scenarios and consequently, a similar amount of digestate (i.e., 80MT) was taken into account. It should also be noted that the quality of the digestate from these two scenarios should also be different and must be analyzed and compared in future studies.\nIn the BMG scenario, 137 kW of parasitic electricity consumption was considered while another 152 kW was taken into account for heating feedstock to 35 °C prior to AD process and to maintain the AD process at mesophilic temperatures through the heat exchanged between the recycled process water and feedstock (Aui et al., 2019). Similarly, the NPA scenario requires similar operating energy (289 kW). Both scenarios have also similar estimated capital costs of about 3.12 million USD (Aui et al., 2019). This capital cost is translated into electricity production costs of 0.44 and 0.23 USD/kWhe for the BMG and NPA scenarios, respectively. For the BMG scenario, the translation of operating costs into electricity cost results in an additional expense of about 0.07 USD/kWe totalling 0.51 USD/kWhe (Aui et al., 2019). It can be assumed that the NPA scenario has the same operating costs and credits including capital depreciation, labour and maintenance, biomass, solid and liquid digestate credit, and solid handling costs for electricity generation up to 950 kWh. Then, we can estimate whether the 859 kWh more electricity generated under the NPA scenario would be worth the higher feedstock cost (i.e., ZVI NPs) or not. In this estimation, income tax was not included.\nOverall, under the conditions of the NPA scenario, the gain related to renewable tax credit for the additional electricity generated (i.e., 859 kWhe) would be about 12.88 USD/h. The revenue obtained through selling the excess electricity of 859 kW would be 54.98 USD/h. The higher operating cost attributed to the NPs cost could be compensated, to some extent, by the lower capital cost of the NPA scenario (i.e., up to 377.96 USD/h less expense), compared to that of BMG scenario. Therefore, it could be concluded that the price of NPs for feasible NPA scenario (consuming 90 kg/d ZVI NPs) must be≤ 118.88 USD/kg. More specifically, if the price of ZVI NPs would be ~118.88 USD/kg, an equal profit vs. the BMG scenario would be expected and any further improvements in cost-effective production of ZVI NPs (< 118.88 USD/ kg) would translate into corresponding profits."

      "text" : "The commercial application of NPs in various industries has posed great risks to the environment. The toxic effects of NPs on microorganisms, plants, and animals have been reported by several studies requesting for more precautions and further investigations prior to their extensive utilization in biological processes such as AD. For instance, NPs could have various physical hazards owing to their considerable lower phase transition temperature or melting point, as well as different magnetic properties, electrical conductivity, and chemical reactivity, compared to their bulk-sized counterparts (European Commmission, 2014). Moreover, metallic or carbon-based NPs may require special\nstorage precautions due to potential increase in self-heating properties, flammability, and even dust explosivity. In addition to the above, NPs could cause health complications due to their altered absorption rates into human (and animal) body via skin contact, ingestion, and inhalation (European Commmission, 2014). Following absorption, NPs may reach the body parts, for example, by crossing blood-brain barrier or cell boundaries while their corresponding bulk sized counterparts are unable to do so. Consequently, the chance for toxicity (in susceptible organs) would be enhanced. It is worth to mention that oxidative stress (which could also be rendered by NPs) in brain could induce cell apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration as well as neuronal cell loss developing various neurodegeneration diseases such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease (Dehhaghi et al., 2018, 2019). Therefore, the impacts of NPs on brain function and health must be carefully assessed as well (Teleanu et al., 2018). Adhesion, endocytosis, semi-endocytosis, and penetration are the four main interaction methods of NPs with cells (Moore et al., 2016). Additionally, greater surface area of NPs evokes higher toxic dose-response, for a given mass, than bulk forms (European Commmission, 2014). It should also be noted that the existence of surface coatings could influence the level of NPs toxicity. It is believed that poor miscibility of fiber-like NPs with biological fluids have potential inhalation consequences such as direct entering into bloodstream from lungs, and ultimately, affecting all body organs (Amoabediny et al., 2009). In the case of the release of NPs into the environment, these compounds may exert biocidal or biostatic effects on microbial communities through the mechanisms already mentioned in Section 2. Additionally, some fungal species (such as wood-decay fungi) may degrade NPs into some antimicrobial metabolites, affecting microbial ecology. A key release pathway of NPs into the environmental is through wastewaters generated by different industry.\nThe toxicity of NPs depends on their type, exposure time, and concentration in a given reaction (Wang and Chen, 2016). Cell membrane disruption and generation of reactive oxygen species have been proposed as the main toxicity mechanisms of some NPs such as ZVI NPs. Therefore, it is worth mentioning that even NPs capable of enhancing biogas production via AD process could exhibit inhibitory effects if used at beyond-optimal concentrations. In light of that, optimizing the concentration of the NPs of interest must be conducted.\nThe potential human health and environmental impacts of any products or services could be analyzed through life cycle assessment (LCA) (Salieri et al., 2018). However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has been published on the LCA of NPs application in AD processes, highlighting the need for future research in this domain. It should be noted that increasing the environmental burdens associated with NPs application (regardless of their biogas enhancement characteristics) through the addition of fresh NPs into AD process is not recommended until appropriate environmental safety assessments are conducted and proper guidelines are generated. The application of NPscontaminated digestate as organic fertilizer would be another important risk that must be thoroughly evaluated. An alternative to application of fresh NPs into AD process is the usage of waste streams containing NPs generated by other industries. This would not only result in partial/ complete bioremediation of these NPs streams but also would lead to enhanced AD process. It should be mentioned that the AD process itself holds great promises in remediating environmental pollution containing NPs through their adsorption and accumulation by the sludge (Wang et al., 2016). Since these waste streams are already disposed of in the environment, therefore, they raise less concerns in comparison with the first approach discussed above, i.e., usage of fresh NPs.\nIn general, the treatment of NPs-contaminated sewage sludge and post-processing of biosolids by AD and some processes such as those mimicking composting/stockpiling could be appreciable in remediating some NPs, such as Zn, Cu, and probably Ag NPs (Lombi et al., 2012). In the case of ZnO NPs, the AD process could remediate them into ZnS and\nZn complexes with cysteine or phosphate. The prescribed composting/ stockpiling procedure could further oxidize ZnS or any other sulfides prior to the application of the digestate as agricultural fertilizer (Lombi et al., 2012). More specifically, many microorganisms could consume different NPs through mechanisms discussed in Section 2, out of which the main two mechanisms are interaction with microorganisms’ membranes and participation in enzymatic activities of microorganisms. Apart from these mechanisms, NPs could be aggregated by bacteriallysynthesized proteins, affecting the chemical reactivity of the NPs (Aruguete and Hochella, 2010; Moreau et al., 2007). For example, the extracellular mineralization of NPs (such as ZnS) has been observed in sulfate-reducing bacteria (Moreau et al., 2007).\nThe degradation of some NPs by bacteria has also been documented. For example, Streptococcus agalactiae made the up-taken ZnO NPs less crystalline and more amorphous (Huang et al., 2008). Similarly, Staphylococcus aureus could break cadmium selenide NPs inside its cell (Kloepfer et al., 2003). In addition to concentration, the rate of microbial bioremediation of NPs is determined by physiochemical properties of NPs, such as core chemical composition, NP size and shape, and coating or surface functionalization that influence microorganismsNP interactions. Another key determinant is the type and physiological state of microorganisms and NPs (Aruguete and Hochella, 2010).\nQuantitative techniques are important for safety environmental assessment of NPs. In contrast to qualitative techniques, only few techniques are available for quantitative analysis of NPs in environmental samples (Farre et al., 2011). For instance, Ag NPs in the environmental samples could be analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, cloud-point extraction coupled to scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, ultraviolet detection, or capillary electrophoresis (Chang et al., 2008; Farre et al., 2011; Geranio et al., 2009). Chemical mechanical planarization, anodic stripping voltammetry, atomic absorption spectroscopy, ultra-violet-vis spectroscopy, and liquid chromatography have also been applied for NPs determination in the environmental samples (Deye et al., 2008; Farre et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2006). Liquid chromatography is a versatile analytical technique and can be coupled with other analytical techniques such as ultra violet and mass spectroscopy to increase its accuracy (Mohammadipanah et al., 2016). Nevertheless, most of these techniques are ineffective for NPs quantification by showing high limits of detections (Farre et al., 2011). Another challenge is the presence of natural NPs in the environment. Sampling and sample preparation steps must be also optimized as they can erroneously lead to a lower concentration of NP in question, for example, because of absorption of organic or inorganic NPs by sample bottles (Farre et al., 2011). Sonication or dispersants must be applied for releasing NPs prior to quantification in the case of soil and sediments samples but these pretreatment methods may interfere with analytical procedures by modifying physicochemical characteristics of the NPs. Hence, the recommended pretreatment is centrifugation, despite the induction of some aggregation (Gimbert et al., 2005)."

      "text" : "The European Commission considers nanotechnology a key enabling technology which is relevant for many sectors, including health, chemicals, the environment, consumer products, and energy (Rauscher et al., 2017). Consequently, nanomaterials implicitly or explicitly have been dealt with in the European Union's regulatory framework. This framework consists of several pieces of sector-specific and horizontal legislations (European Commission, 2012a, b). In general, the existing legislations particularly cover the potential risks associated with nanomaterials and may explicitly or implicitly mention nanomaterials (Rauscher et al., 2017). In the case of the EU legislation explicitly addressing nanomaterials, authorisation of nanomaterials for specific application, safety assessment with nano-specific characteristics included, and nanomaterial specific information are required (Rauscher\net al., 2017). European Commission (2012a) has concluded that similar to normal substances or chemical species, nanomaterials could be classified as toxic or safe compounds. However, no general classifications could be defined as the toxicity of nanomaterials depends not only on the nature of nanomaterials but also on the type of application. Therefore, a case-by-case risk assessment of nanomaterials should be conducted using all the relevant information.\nCurrently, each piece of the EU legislation has established binding rules only within its subject matter and scope (Rauscher et al., 2017). For example, a pre-market notification including the presence and specification of nanomaterials must be conducted under the nanomaterial regulations on cosmetic products (European Commission, 2009). The specification data of a given nanomaterial used must present chemical and physical characteristics, estimation of its amount in product, its particles size, pertinent safety data, the toxicological profile, and appropriate predicted exposure conditions. As already mentioned, other legislative provisions have specific definitions of their purpose and each legislation cover nanomaterials within that purpose and scope only (Rauscher et al., 2017).\nThe implicitly of nanomaterials has been covered in certain legislative provisions, for example, in the most comprehensive EU legislative provisions for chemicals, i.e., Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regardless of their physical state, shape, or size (European Commission, 2006). The substances produced or imported in quantities ≥1MT/yr must be registered while those marketed in volumes ≥10MT/yr also need a chemical safety assessment (Rauscher et al., 2017). All forms of a substance must be addressed in the safety assessment of registration dossier. Substances only exist in nanoform(s) require REACH's regulation based on the annual quantity. In contrast, for substances that exist in two forms (i.e., bulk or non-nanoform, and nanoform), applicants can either submit a dossier, explicitly covering nanoform or prepare and submit two dossiers separately covering nanoform and bulk size. European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) is responsible for safety issues of nanomaterials under the REACH legislation. Some recommendations on the registration of nanomaterials have been covered by the agency in periodically updated guidance on Information Requirements and Chemical Safety Assessment (IR & CSA) appendices (Rauscher et al., 2017). This agency also consists of experts from accredited stake-holder's organizations, ECHA, the European Commission, and EU member states in a group named nanomaterials working group (NMWG) providing informal recommendations on technical and scientific challenges relevant to the implementation of Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP), and REACH regulations for nanomaterials. The registered nanomaterials are also investigated by another group organized by ECHA, i.e., group assessing already registered nanomaterials (GAARN), working on finding the best practices for assessing and managing the nanomaterials safety under the REACH legislation (Rauscher et al., 2017). The results obtained by GAARN are reflected in guidelines revised or developed by ECHA.\nSimilarly, the European Commission relies on Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER), an independent scientific committee, for preparing proposals and policy relevant to health and environment safety. SCHEER provides the European Commission with scientific recommendations on emerging health and environmental issues/risks developed by new technologies including nanotechnology (Rauscher et al., 2017). Manufactured nanomaterials could be globally discussed in a forum, called Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials (WPMN), launched by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2006 (Rauscher et al., 2017). A responsible development of nanotechnology is promoted by this forum through debates on safety evaluation and risk assessment of produced nanomaterials. Therefore, WPMN seeks international cooperation on environmental safety and human health aspects of produced nanomaterials with an emphasis on endpoints pertinent to toxicology and environmental fate, material safety,\nmammalian toxicology, and physicochemical characteristics. The aim of OECD's WPMN is, therefore, the generation of proper methodologies to assure safe application of nanotechnology (Rasmussen et al., 2016; Rauscher et al., 2017).\nOverall, despite some developments, there is no specific regulation at EU level for many of the nanomaterials, in particular, related to their application in the AD process. However, nanomaterials may have been implicitly or explicitly covered in different legislations for specific groups of products such as biocidal (Regulation 528/2012), cosmetic (Regulation 1223/2009), novel food (Regulation, 2015/2283), food additives (Regulation 1333/2008), active and intelligent food contact (Regulation 450/2009), and plastic food contact products (Regulation 10/2011). More specifically, definition, approval procedure, safety assessment, labelling, and guidelines relevant to nanomaterials have been already covered to some extent for biocidal, cosmetic, and novel food products by mentioned regulations. The lack of rigid guidelines and regulations for application of NPs in the AD process demotivates private economic operators by not clearing their compliance (legal obligations) leading to legal uncertainty (Busquets-Fité et al., 2017) and should be addressed in the near future.\n3.4. Patents in the field of NPs-augmented AD process\nProbably the first patent exploring the application of NPs in the AD process was built upon the findings of a US patent No. 4,981,593A (Priestley and Woods, 1991), which was granted for using the magnetite particles (i.e., Fe3O4) in millimeter size (50–100mm) for H2S removal. Interestingly, despite satisfactory results, the bulk size Fe3O4 led to decreases in biogas production by up to an order of magnitude vs. the control (Priestley and Woods, 1991). The authors concluded that biogas production was proportional with the size of magnetite used. In light of that, Applied Nanoparticles S.L. (AppNPs) was granted a patent (US 9,416,373 B2 Biogas production, 2016 and EP2683662, 2017), involving the application of iron oxide NPs for enhancing biogas production (Puntes et al., 2016). The method named BioGAS+ is the drop-in additive derived from NPs aiming at enhancing the AD process with respect to biogas production. The enhancement mechanisms are those already explained in Section 2. The main advantage of these NPs over conventional iron oxide NPs are their engineered nature allowing controlled release/dosing of Fe ions to prevent iron toxicity and excess reactivity (Busquets-Fité et al., 2017). The NPs introduced formed a colloidal solution preventing its aggregation while they are miscible in feedstock, allowing homogeneous distribution of iron ions in feedstock. This allows a sustained and continuous (long time) supply of iron ions to AD plant till the depletion of organic materials while avoiding concentration fluctuations following inoculation and assimilation of iron oxide. The Fe3O4 NPs sized 3–100 nm in diameter was decorated with serum proteins (Puntes et al., 2016). The ideal concentration of Fe3O4 NPs in the solution was determined at 0.5–1mg/mL of solvents (such as inorganic salts, deoxygenated tetramethylammonium hydroxide, etc.). Under optimum conditions (21 d, pH 8), up to 74.84% (232mL/g) increase in biogas could be obtained in the presence of Fe3O4 NPs, compared to control (310mL/g) (Puntes et al., 2016). According to a report by Busquets-Fité et al. (2017), BioGAS+ has a Technology Readiness Level of nine. However, despite good biogas enhancement capabilities, the application of iron oxide NPs in AD suffers from a number of shortcomings, including requirement for very high dose (0.5–1 mg/mL) and a 10-d lag phase (Pérez Martínez, 2017).\nIn another patent, Fe3O4 NPs were continuously added into a continuous-flow anaerobic reactor to enhance the methane production rate (马文成 et al., 2015). Under optimum conditions (circulation flow of 100 L/d; sludge concentration of 10 g/L, 34–36 °C, pH 6.8–7.2, hydraulic retention time of 20 h; water effluent flow of 10 L/d; and water effluent COD of 5 g/L), the yield of biogas and methane were respectively improved by up to 90.8% and 112.6%, compared with controls. The NPs size and dose were 40–60 nm in diameter and 0.02–0.04 g/g\nVSS, respectively (马文成 et al., 2015)."

      "heading" : "3.5. Practical applications of this study",
      "text" : "Among the above-mentioned NPs studied, the most promising nanomaterials for enhancing biogas production are ZVI NPs. The growth of the microorganisms beneficial to the AD process and the enzymes involved are stimulated in the presence of this type of NPs. Moreover, ZVI NPs could stabilize the AD process and therefore, enhance biogas production. Overall, the future commercial application of nano-additives for enhancing the AD of waste organic materials seems technoeconomically feasible. However, environmental aspects of NPs application for biogas production are yet to be further assessed. More specifically, the exact compositional analysis of digestates containing NPs must be conducted in order to assess their environmental benefits (as fertilizer) and/or hazards (soil pollution, biolcidal, biostatic, etc.). The analysis of these digestates could also allow determining the fate of augmented NPs in AD process. In another word, the rate of NPs escaping in intact and/or converted forms should be quantified. Overall, efforts must be devoted to greatly reduce the price of NPs as well as to reduce the rate of their escape from the AD process. The latter could be achieved by appropriately dosing the NPs and/or increasing hydraulic retention time among other methods allowing complete consumption of the augmented NPs.\nIt should be stressed that biofuels production could only have environmental, societal, and economic sustainability when all their tradeoffs/weak-points are determined and appropriately addressed (Kazemi Shariat Panahi et al., 2019a,d; Tabatabaei et al., 2019a). On the other hand, the strong-points of innovative procedures in biofuels production such as the application of NPs to enhance biogas production must also be improved and fully exploited. In this context, introduction and commercialization of such innovative processes should be preceded by thorough assessments to ensure maximal beneficial impacts while adverse environmental/health consequences are minimized."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "According to the investigations reviewed herein, both positive and negative effects of NPs on AD (biogas production) and methane content have been reported. Therefore, it is important to obtain more in-depth insights into the impacts of NPs on the microbial community and waste digestion process with an aim to improve biogas production yield during the AD process. In fact, NPs present a high surface to volume ratio with high reactivity potential that makes them suitable for various reactions. It should be noted that the complex microbial community involved in the AD makes extrapolation of the results of lab-scale NPs study to commercial-scale ones complicated. Therefore, types of NPs and their concentrations must be tailored based on the results obtained at large scale operations. Future research should also focus on various attributes of NPs when used as additives in biogas production. Those attributes include but not limited to facilitating mixing and pumping operations (e.g., through reducing substrate viscosity and decreasing energy consumption), improving biogas release, enriching the population and diversity of beneficial microorganisms for AD, and inducing the production and activity of AD-related enzymes. Moreover, investigation of different NPs-augmented AD processes with respect to changes in Gibbs free energy remains a fascinating field to explore by future studies.\nOverall, the economic viability of large-scale NPs-augmented AD process is mainly dependent on the price of NPs. Moreover, regardless of the economic feasibility issue, the application of NPs in any industries (including biogas industry) raises some environmental risks that must be appropriately addressed. Therefore, to stay on the safe side, it is recommended to consider AD as a bioremediating process for treating sludge contaminated with NPs. In this context, future research should be directed toward investigating the impacts of various NPs on\nAD process. For example, simultaneous application of two or more types of NPs and the potential interactions and beneficial effects should also be scrutinized. Moreover, NPs speciation during AD process and the existence of remnant of NPs or NP-derived compounds must be analyzed and traced in the digestate to avoid contamination of agricultural soil.\nAnother future research interest would be the application of digestate from NPs-augmented AD (including specific NPs) to enhance growth of specific agriculture crops. Additionally, it would also be fascinating to assess the adsorption rate of different NPs from contaminated soil or water by plants and their deposition sites (e.g. stalk, root, fruit, leaves) in the form of intact NPs or their derivatives. In this context, the NPs-contaminated parts of plants could be employed as biogas enhancing additives in AD process while assessing their proper doses."

Among the latest innovations investigated to enhance the overall performance of this process both qualitatively and quantitatively, the application of some nanoparticles (NPs) has attracted a great deal of attention. Typically, the NPs of potential benefit to the AD process could be divided into three groups: (i) zerovalent iron (ZVI) NPs, (ii) metallic and metal oxides NPs, and (iii) carbon-based NPs. The present review focuses on the latest findings reported on the application of these NPs in AD process and presents their various mechanisms of action leading to higher or lower biogas production rates. Among the NPs studies, ZVI NPs could be regarded as the most promising nanomaterials for enhancing biogas production through stabilizing the AD process as well as by stimulating the growth of beneficial microorganisms to the AD process and the enzymes involved. Future research should focus on various attributes of NPs when used as additives in biogas production, including facilitating mixing and pumping operations, enriching the population and diversity of beneficial microorganisms for AD, improving biogas release, and inducing the production and activity of AD-related enzymes. The higher volume of methane-enriched biogas would be translated into higher returns on investment and could therefore, result in further growth of the biogas production industry. Nevertheless, efforts should be devoted to decreasing the price of NPs so that the enhanced biogas and methane production (by over 90%, compared to control) would be more economically justified, facilitating the large-scale application of these compounds. In addition to economic considerations, environmental issues are also regarded as major constraints which should be addressed prior to widespread implementation of NP-augmented AD processes. More specifically, the fate of NPs augmented in AD process should be scrutinized to ensure maximal beneficial impacts while adverse environmental/health consequences are minimized.",
