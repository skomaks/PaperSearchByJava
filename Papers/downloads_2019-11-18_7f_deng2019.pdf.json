In this work, we reported a simple and sensitive electrochemical method for evaluation of cell apoptosis by determining the activity of caspase-3. Specifically, a peptide substrate specific to caspase-3 was attached on the graphene electrode surface through the hydrophobic and πstacking interactions. Cleavage of the peptide substrate by caspase-3 resulted in the exposure of an amino terminal Cu(II) and Ni(II)-binding (ATCUN) motif on the electrode surface. The ATCUN peptide fragment can interact with Cu(II) to produce an ATCUN-Cu(II) complex which exhibits good electrocatalytic property toward water oxidation. The catalytic current increased linearly with caspase-3 concentration ranging from 0.5 pg/mL to 2 ng/mL. The method showed a detection limit of 0.2 pg/mL for caspase-3 detection. Finally, the sensor electrode was used to evaluate cell apoptosis induced by four drugs (staurosporine, vitamin C, doxorubicin and cisplatin). This work should be valuable for diagnosis and prognosis of apoptosis-relative diseases and designing of novel protease biosensors."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Apoptosis is a highly regulated and controlled process conferring advantages during an organism’s lifecycle. However, dysregulation of apoptosis may lead directly to many diseases, including cancers, neurological disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and autoimmune diseases [1]. Thus, cell apoptotic death has attracted intensive attentions in the fields of pathology, pharmacology, and toxicology. During the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of apoptosis-relative diseases, methods for apoptosis evaluation are required [2,3]. To date, the established methods for apoptosis detection include observation of cell morphology changes, probing of DNA fragmentation and annexin V staining, and detection of cytochrome c release from mitochondria [4]. Nevertheless, these methods are troubled by their low sensitivity, complex operation, and/or high cost.\nCaspases belong to a family of cysteine proteases that play essential\nroles in apoptosis. Of kinds of caspases, caspase-3 is the central player in mediating internal and external apoptosis pathways [1]. Thus, caspase-3 has been considered not only as a therapeutic target but also as a diagnostic marker of apoptosis-relative diseases. The protease can specifically recognize and cleave the C-terminus of Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD). Based on the proteolytic activity, recently, a huge number of methods have been developed for detection of caspase-3 and evaluation of cell apoptosis, including electrochemistry [5–16], colorimetric assays [17,18], fluorescence [19,20], high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [21], surface-enhanced scattering (SERS) [22], photoelectrochemical and electrochemiluminescent detection [23–27], and surface plasma resonance (SPR) [28]. Among them, electrochemistry is the most powerful analytical technique in view of its simplicity, rapid response, high sensitivity, and suitability for miniaturization. Usually, the DEVD-containing peptide is immobilized on an electrode surface. Cleavage of the peptide leads to the remove of redox label or facilitate\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2019.01.137 Received 20 November 2018; Received in revised form 20 January 2019; Accepted 27 January 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors at: Henan Province of Key Laboratory of New Optoelectronic Functional Materials, Anyang Normal University, Anyang, Henan, 455000, People's Republic of China.\nE-mail addresses: liulin@aynu.edu.cn (L.

To improve the detection sensitivity, efforts have been made to amplify the electrochemical signal with enzymes, nanomaterials and redox cycling [21,29]. The use of nanomaterials with large surface area and high electrical conductivity can increase the loading number of peptide substrates or electroactive reporters on electrode surface to amplify the electrical signal. Graphene, one-atom-thick two dimensional carbon material with hexagonal lattice, exhibits special features, including high surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and enhanced electron transfer rate. Sequence-specific peptide attached onto graphene surface can be cleaved by proteases including caspases, which facilitates the development of protease biosensors [30–32]. Here, we attempted to develop a graphene-based electrochemical sensing platform for caspase-3 detection and apoptosis evaluation.\nGraphene-based materials exhibit high electrocatalytic ability toward electrochemical sensing of redox-active biomolecules [33]. Recently, it has been reported that the Cu(II) complex attached onto a graphene electrode surface through π-stacking interactions exhibits extremely high electrocatalytic ability toward water oxidation [34]. Copper is an essential metal and exists in a number of proteins. Peptide with a specific sequence has been shown to interact with a number of metal ions including Cu(II). For example, amino terminal Cu(II) and Ni (II)-binding (ATCUN) motif, comprising of a free NH2-terminus, a histidine (His) residue in the third position and two intervening peptide nitrogens, exhibits high binding ability to Cu(II) in a square plannar configuration with a 1:1 binding mode [35]. We have investigated the redox properties of ATCUN-Cu(II) metallopeptides and found that they exhibit good electrocatalytic ability toward water oxidation [36]. For these views, herein, we developed a simple, sensitive and signal-on electrochemical sensing platform for caspase-3 detection and apoptosis evaluation by the generation of ATCUN-Cu(II) complexes as the water oxidation electrocatalysts on the graphene electrode surface. In contrast to other electrochemical methods for caspase-3 detection, the signal-on sensing platform exhibits lower signal-to-background ratio and obviates the labeling of peptide substrate with an electrochemical reporter. Moreover, the signal amplification by the generated electrocatalysts does not require addition of extra resources to the electrolyte solution."

      "heading" : "3. Results and discussion",
      "text" : "For electrochemical biosensors, the electrode with good catalytic ability and high surface can facilitate the electron transfer, thus amplifying the electrochemical signal. Graphene electrode with high surface area and abundant functional groups allowed for the modification of probes or capture elements through non-covalent interactions (e.g. πstacking and electrostatic adsorption) or covalent coupling reactions. Pyrene is well-known for its non-covalent interaction with nanomaterials including π-electron-rich frameworks (e.g., carbon nanotubes and graphene) [37,38]. We first attempted to modify the graphene with a pyrene-labeled peptide of Ac-GDEVDSK(pyrene)H through π-stacking interactions. However, a high background current from the electrochemical oxidation of pyrene was observed (Fig. S3). This may be attributed to the less loading amount of peptide on graphene surface through the covalent coupling reaction. The FFFF sequence ensures the attachment of peptide on graphene surface through the hydrophobic and π-stacking interactions [31]. For this view, peptide with a sequence of Ac-GDEVDSK(FFFF)H was used as the substrate of caspase-3. The carboxy group in the C-terminal of the peptide is free, which can facilitate the turnover of ATCUN-Cu(II) and improve the catalytic oxidation of H2O molecule [36]. Thus, the FFFF sequence was linked to the side chain of the Lys residue. Cleavage of the peptide by caspase-3 between D and S residues leads to the detachment of Ac-GDEVD fragment from electrode surface, thus allowing for the exposure of an ATCUN motif (SKH) (Scheme 1). Consequently, the remained peptide fragment on the electrode surface can bind with Cu(II) to form the ATCUN-Cu(II) complex, which exhibits good electrocatalytic ability toward water oxidation. Since signal-on electrochemical sensing platform exhibits higher sensitivity and lower signal-to-background ratio than that of signal-off one, the peptide substrate is designed by including a potential ATCUN motif in the C-terminus, but not pre-labeling of the peptide with an ATCUN motif in the N-terminus. Moreover, the close proximity between ATCUN motif and graphene can facilitate the electron transfer between Cu(II) center and electrode [39].\nFig. 1A shows the CVs of the peptide/GO-modified electrode in the electrolyte solution before and after incubation with caspase-3. No electrocatalytic voltammetric wave was observed on the Ac-GDEVDSK (FFFF)H/GO-modified electrode without incubation with caspase-3 (curve a). The result is acceptable since the substrate peptide can not bind Cu(II) to generate an electrocatalyst for water oxidation. However, after incubation with caspase-3, the sensor electrode exhibited a sigmoidal CV wave with an oxidation potential of ˜0.82 V (curve b) in the Cu(II)-containing electrolyte solution. The CV wave shows similar characteristics to that of the Cu(II)-based electrocatalysts toward water oxidation, which is indicative of a catalytic process in which the electrogenerated Cu(III) is immediately reduced by H2O molecule through intramolecular coupling mechanism or nucleophilic attack of H2O on the high-oxidation-state CuIV=O intermediate [36,40,41]. But no electrocatalytic wave was observed when the caspase-3-treated electrode was scanned in a Cu(II)-free electrolyte solution (curve c). This result suggested that the electrocatalytic wave of curve b is attributed to water oxidation by the SK(FFFF)H-Cu(II) complexes generated on the electrode surface. Thus, proteolysis of the peptide on electrode surface can be monitored by measuring the electrocatalytic signal produced by the resulting ATCUN-Cu(II) complex. We also found that the electrochemical signals increased with the cleavage time (Fig. S4). The current-time curve began to level off beyond 20min, demonstrating that the peptide substrates on electrode surface have been digested by caspase-3.\nTo evaluate the specificity of the method, serum albumin (BSA) and other proteases including thrombin and trypsin were tested. As shown in Fig. 1B, these proteases did not cause the presence of an\nelectrocatalytic wave, which is indicative of high selectivity of the sensor. Also, the coexistence of these tested proteases in caspase-3 solution did not lead to the significant decrease in the catalytic peak current, indicating that these proteins show no influence on the cleavage of peptide by caspase-3. To further evaluate the specificity of this method, DEVD-FMK, a well-known caspase-3 inhibitor, was incubated with caspase-3 for the assay. As shown in curve f, when the sensing electrode was exposed to the mixture of caspase-3 and DEVD-FMK, a smaller voltammetric response was observed in contrast to that in the absence of inhibitor, indicating that caspase-3 activity was depressed by DEVD-FMK. Thus, the electrocatalytic peak current is related to caspase-3 activity and the proposed sensor can be used for the selective detection of caspase-3.\nTo demonstrate the analytical merits of this sensor, the CVs of the modified electrode after incubation with different concentrations of caspase-3 were collected. As shown in Fig. 2A, the electrocatalytic current was intensified with increase of caspase-3 concentration ranging from 0.5 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL. The method allowed for the analysis of caspase-3 with a linear range of 0.5 ˜ 2000 pg/mL (Fig. 2B). The detection limit was estimated to be 0.2 pg/mL by determining the smallest concentration of caspase-3 at which the signal is clearly distinguishable from the background. This value is comparable to or even lower than that achieved with the p-nitroaniline (pNA)-labeled (0.1 nM) or p-methoxyaniline-conjugated (0.0002 units/mL) peptide substrate [6,12] and by the signal amplification of methylene blue/GO (0.06 pg/mL) [7], calixarene functionalized reduction of GO (0.0167 pg/mL) [5], bare silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) (0.1 pg/mL) or CB [8] capped AgNPs (24.62 pg/mL) [8,15], magnetic beads/\nScheme 1. Scheme representation of the proposed strategy for caspase-3 detection based on the generation of ATCUN-Cu(II) for electrocatalytic water oxidation.\nhorseradish peroxidas (MBs-HRP) (100 pM) [9], and gold nanoparticlefunctionalized MCM-41 (AuNP-MCM-41)/MBs-HRP (5 fM) [10]. The low detection limit can be attributed to the good electrocatalytic ability of the resulting Cu(II) complexes toward water oxidation and the low background current of the “signal-on” sensing strategy. Moreover, our method required a simple detection procedure and showed a wide linear range.\nTo demonstrate the viability of the established method for apoptosis evaluation, Hela cells were selected as the cell type. As shown in Fig. 3A, a low oxidation current was obtained when the sensing electrode was incubated with the Hela cell lysate (curve a), implying the weak activity of caspase-3 in the Hela cells. However, the current increased greatly when the Hela cells were pre-incubated with STS (a commonly used apoptosis inducer) for a given time (curves b ˜ g). This indicated that caspase-3 in the cells was activated during apoptosis. The apoptosis was also confirmed by observing cell morphology change (Fig. S5). Furthermore, we found that the current increase was timedependent. The current-time curve showed an inverted-V shape (Fig. 3B). It was initially increased with the increase of incubation time and reached a maximum value at 6 h. The result demonstrated that long-time incubation of the cells with apoptosis inducer depressed the caspase-3 activity. The result is acceptable because over-expressed Bcell lymphoma-2 or other proteins may block apoptotic response and depress caspase-3 activity during long-time apoptosis [24].\nTo demonstrate the applicability of this electrode for evaluation of caspase-3 activity and cell apoptosis in response to potential drugs, the cells were treated with different concentrations of STS and three drugs (vitamin C, DOX and cisplatin) for assays. When the Hela cells were pre-\nincubated with the four compounds at the concentration of 5 μM, the current increased in the order of STS > DOX > cisplatin > vitamin C (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B depicts the dependence of the current value on the concentration of the four compounds. It can be observed that the current value increased greatly with the increase of the concentration of DOX, cisplatin or STS. No significant difference was observed when the cells were incubated with and without vitamin C. This indicated that STS and the two anticancer drugs (DOX and cisplatin) can induce the cell apoptosis, but vitamin C is not a good apoptosis inducer. The result is in agreement with that obtained by the fluorescent probe [20]. Thus, this sensor can be used to evaluate the response of cells to the potential drugs for apoptosis by monitoring caspase-3 activity."

      "text" : "In summary, a simple and sensitive electrochemical method was proposed for assay of caspase-3 activity and evaluation of cell apoptosis. Differing from the existing methods for caspase-3 or protease detection, the signal-on sensing platform dose not require labeling of peptide with a redox-active reporter or an extra recognition element such as biotin group for signal readout. The signal amplification strategy is simple than that by the enzyme or nanomaterial labels without reducing the detection sensitivity. H2O molecule was the substrate of the electrocatalytic reaction; thus, the sensing platform exhibits the advantages of simple operation procedure, environment friendliness and low background current. Satisfactory results were obtained for evaluation of cell apoptosis in response to drugs. Efforts have being made in our group to design novel electronic sensing devices\nbased on the electrocatalytic properties of ATCUN-Cu(II) complexes."

In this work, we reported a simple and sensitive electrochemical method for evaluation of cell apoptosis by determining the activity of caspase-3. Specifically, a peptide substrate specific to caspase-3 was attached on the graphene electrode surface through the hydrophobic and πstacking interactions. Cleavage of the peptide substrate by caspase-3 resulted in the exposure of an amino terminal Cu(II) and Ni(II)-binding (ATCUN) motif on the electrode surface. The ATCUN peptide fragment can interact with Cu(II) to produce an ATCUN-Cu(II) complex which exhibits good electrocatalytic property toward water oxidation. The catalytic current increased linearly with caspase-3 concentration ranging from 0.5 pg/mL to 2 ng/mL. The method showed a detection limit of 0.2 pg/mL for caspase-3 detection. Finally, the sensor electrode was used to evaluate cell apoptosis induced by four drugs (staurosporine, vitamin C, doxorubicin and cisplatin). This work should be valuable for diagnosis and prognosis of apoptosis-relative diseases and designing of novel protease biosensors.",
