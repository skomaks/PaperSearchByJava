The potential for widespread human exposure raises safety concerns about\ngraphene and its derivatives, referred to as graphene family nanomaterials (GFNs). Due to their\nunique chemical and physical properties, graphene and its derivatives have found important places\nin their respective application fields, yet they are being found to have cytotoxic and genotoxic\neffects too. Since the discovery of graphene, a number of researches are being conducted to\nfind out the toxic potential of GFNs to different cell and animal models, finding their suitability\nfor being used in new and varied innovative fields. This paper presents a systematic review of\nthe research done on GFNs and gives an insight into the mode and action of these nanosized\nmoieties. The paper also emphasizes on the recent and up-to-date developments in research on\nGFNs and their nanocomposites for their toxic effects.\nKeywords: graphene, quantum dots, desalination, drug delivery, antibacterial, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity\nIntroduction Graphene has emerged as a sensational nanocarbon with unusual properties. Graphene\nis a two-dimensional planar and hexagonal array of carbon atoms. Each of these carbons\nis sp2-hybridized and has four bonds, one σ bond with each of its three neighbors and one π-bond that is oriented out of plane. It is a gapless material with ballistic conduction at room temperature and high carrier mobility. The complete planar exposure of\nthe carbon atoms renders graphene a theoretical surface area .2,500 m2/g. The new\nproperties of graphene and its hybrid structures have been widely explored for advanced\ntechnological applications in electronics, optics, and various other fields. Graphene has\nattracted attention among the scientific community since it was developed as a single\nlayer of material by Novoselov et al1 by using the scotch tape method. It consists of\ncarbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice and has a thickness of a single atom. It\nhas the property of extremely high intrinsic mobility of charge carriers. It has a zero\nband gap and high chemical stability. Related materials include few-layer graphene,\nultrathin graphite, graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and graphene\nnanosheets. Graphene materials vary in layer number, lateral dimension, surface chem-\nistry, defect density, or quality of the individual graphene sheets, and composition or\npurity. In this way, GFNs are analogous to carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which vary in\nwall number, diameter, length, surface chemistry and the amount, composition, and\nN\nan ot\nec hn\nol og\ny, S\nci en\nce a\nnd A\npp lic\nat io\nns d\now nl\noa de\nd fr\nom h\nttp s:\n//w w\nw .d\nov ep\nre ss\n.c om\nF or\np er\nso na\nl u se\no nl\ny.\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\n1 / 1\nNanotechnology, Science and Applications 2016:9submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress\nDovepress\n16"

By modifying the size of the pores,\nspecific materials other than salt, based on their molecular\nsize, can also be filtered out. There is less understanding as\nto whether NPG is strong enough to maintain its mechanical\nintegrity under the high hydraulic pressures inherent to the\nRO desalination process.36 An NPG membrane can maintain\nits mechanical integrity in RO, but the choice of substrate\nfor graphene is critical to this performance. Nicolai et al38\nassessed GO framework membranes for water desalination\nusing classical molecular dynamics simulations. For a given\npore size (n=16 or 32), water permeability of GO framework membranes increases when the pore spacing decreases,\nwhereas for a given pore spacing (n=32 or 64), water permeability increases by up to 2 orders of magnitude when the\npore size increases. Carboxyl functional groups can enhance\nion exclusion for all pores considered, but the effect becomes\nless pronounced as both the ion concentration and the pore\ndiameter increase.39 When compared with a CNT of similar\npore diameter, graphene sheet pores functionalized with\nCOO− groups were found to be more effective in excluding\nCl− ions from passing through the membrane."

Similarly, Wu\net al158 studied the potential cytotoxicity of GO nanosheets on\nhuman breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line and suggested\nthat higher concentrations of GO ($100 µg/mL) exhibited time- and dose-dependent cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231\ncells. The exposure suppressed the colony-forming capacity\nand cellular proliferation. Even higher concentrations of GO\nincreased the proportion of G0/G1 phase cells and resulted\nin higher generation of intracellular reactive oxygen spe-\ncies (ROS), which may be directly related to cytotoxicity.\nThe paclitaxel-loaded composites were found to enter the\nA549 cancer cells and exert cytotoxicity.89 PEGylation of\nGO has shown to reduce or change its cytotoxicity.160–162\nLymphoma cells were treated with different concentrations\n(10–100 µg/mL) of PEGylated GO at different time points (6, 12, and 24 hours), but a low toxicity to lymphoma cells\nwas found suggesting a fair chance for the application of\nPEGylated GO in medicines.160 GO has been found to pres-\nent an attenuation effect on X-ray-induced genotoxicity\nin cultured lymphocytes.163 The effect of surface coatings\non cytotoxicity of GFNs was studied.161 Naked GO could\ninduce a significant toxicity to macrophages, while the\ncoated GO with biocompatible macromolecules such as\nPEG or bovine serum albumin could greatly attenuate their\ntoxicity. Qu et al164 found that QDs posed great damage to\nmacrophages through intracellular accumulation of QDs\ncoupled with ROS, particularly for QDs coated with PEG-\nNH 2 . QDs modified with PEG-conjugated amine particles were found to exert robust inhibition on cell proliferation\nof J744A.1 macrophages. Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs)\nsynthesized using potassium permanganate-based oxida-\ntion and exfoliation followed by reduction with hydroiodic\nacid (rGNP-HI) were found to show excellent potential as\nbiomodal contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging\nand computed tomography. In vitro cytotoxicity analysis\nperformed on NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and A498 human\nkidney epithelial cells showed CD 50 values of rGNP-HI to lie between 179 and 301 µg/mL.165 The cell viability experiments revealed that the presence of the nanocomposites of GO with\ngold nanoparticles can significantly reduce the cytotoxicity\nof the amyloid peptides.166 GOs were also found to induce\napoptosis of erythroid cells through oxidative stress in E14.5\nfetal liver erythroid cells.164 Waiwijit et al167 assessed cytox-\nicities of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (MDA cells)\non carbon paste and graphene–carbon paste substrates. Cell\nviability on graphene–carbon paste substrate was found to\ninitially increase as graphene content increased from 0 to\n2.5 wt%, but then decreased as the content increased further.\nSimilarly, Wu et al168 evaluated the cytotoxicity on human\nmultiple myeloma cells (RPMI-8226) treated with GO, doxo-\nrubicin (DOX), and GO loaded with DOX (GO/DOX) and\nrevealed that cells treated with GO, DOX, and GO/DOX for\n24 hours showed a decrease in proliferation. GO/DOX was\nfound to significantly inhibit cell proliferation as compared\nwith pure DOX (P,0.01). But purified GO as prepared\nand characterized in the study169 did not induce significant\ncytotoxic responses in vitro, or inflammation and granuloma\nformation in vivo. GO and carboxyl GNPs were found to\ncause dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells\nwith plasma membrane damage. But no toxicity was found\nwhen applied at very low concentrations (,4 µg/mL).170 Cell division of Chlorella vulgaris was found to be promoted at\n24 hours and then inhibited at 96 hours after GO and carboxyl\nsingle-walled carbon nanotube (C-SWCNT) exposure. At 96\nhours, both GO and C-SWCNT inhibited the rates of cell\ndivision by 0.08%–15% and 0.8%–28.3%, respectively.171\nTable 2 shows different cytotoxic studies on graphene and\nits nanocomposites.\nGQDs with their unique morphology and exceptional\nproperties, hold great promise for many applications, espe-\ncially in the biomedical field.178 Cytotoxicity of GQDs have\nbeen assessed by various researchers on erythroid cells and\nmacrophages,164 human gastric cancer MGC-803 and breast\ncancer MCF-7 cells,178 and human A549 lung carcinoma\ncells and human neural glioma C6 cells.179 Cytotoxicity of\nthree kinds of GQDs with different modified groups (NH 2 , COOH, and CO–N (CH 3 ) 2 , respectively) in human A549 lung carcinoma cells and human neural glioma C6 cells was\ninvestigated using thiazoyl blue colorimetric (MTT) assay and\ntrypan blue assay. GQDs were found to randomly disperse in\nthe cytoplasm, but not get diffused into nucleus. The study\nsuggested the three modified GQDs to have good biocom-\npatibility even at the concentration of 200 µg/mL.179 GQDs were demonstrated to get internalized primarily through\ncaveolae-mediated endocytosis and have lower toxicities as\ncompared with micrometer-sized GO on the cell viability,\ninternal cellular ROS level, mitochondrial membranes poten-\ntial, and cell cycles.178\nGenetic toxicity in animal models represents a potential\nhealth hazard that may lead to different health-related ailments\nincluding cancer.
