Herein, we develop a simple metal organic frameworks (MOFs) based approach to prepare bifunctional Co-NC@ Mo2C complex catalysts. Differently from traditional carbon encapsulated functional nanomaterials, herein the carbon-based framework derived carbonitride and Co nanoparticles (Co-NC) are encapsulated with Mo2C. Benefiting from the unique reverse-encapsulation structure and synergetic effects of Mo2C and Co-NC, the Co-NC@Mo2C catalyst shows superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. In alkaline media, it affords the current density of 10mA cm−2 at low overpotentials of 99mV and 347mV for HER and OER, respectively. Interestingly, due to a reversed encapsulation structure where Co nanoparticles are protected by Mo2C, it leads to an outstanding HER catalytic activity (a low overpotential of 143mV) and stability in acidic solutions. Remarkably, when employed as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.685 V is required to reach the current density of 10mA cm−2 in alkaline media with excellent stability, making the Co-NC@Mo2C an efficient non noble metal bifunctional electrocatalyst toward water splitting."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Under the concept of sustainable development, hydrogen energy is attracting more and more attention [1–5], and electrocatalytic water splitting is widely regarded as a promising approach for hydrogen generation. The water splitting involves two half reactions: cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [6,7], wherein, the key requirement for successful implementation of these two chemical reactions is highly active and stable electrocatlaysts [8]. To date, most of the commercial catalysts are platinum (Pt)-based electrocatalysts for HER and ruthenium (Ru)/iridium (Ir)-based electrocatalysts for OER, respectively [9–12]. However, their high cost and scarcity limit the wide-scale applications. Additionally, HER and OER electrocatalysts often function well in different media, which result in inferior efficiency of overall water splitting when assembled them in the same electrolyte solutions. Therefore, it is highly desirable to rationally design and synthesize cheap and efficient bifunctional catalysts with long stability for water splitting.\nRecently, the design and fabrication of porous carbon with\nhierarchical structures derived from metal organic frameworks (MOFs) has become a hot topic for their potential applications in energy storage, sensor, catalysis etc [13–26]. For example, ZIF-67 have been used as precursors for Co-NC hybrid through facile pyrolysis. The resultant Co-NC complex shows a high surface area, high graphitization degree, a CoNx moiety and uniform N dopant with a regular shape on the nanoscale [27–30]. When applied as OER catalyst, it exhibits excellent activity, approaching the value of Ru or Ir [31,32]. However, common Co-based catalysts suffer from an inferior HER performance [33,34]. To address this problem, researchers have introduced more heteroatoms into Co-based catalysts, such as Pd [35], Ni [36,37], P [38], leading to the change of surface properties and then the enhancement of electrocatalytic performances [7].\nOn the other side, molybdenum compounds, such as MoC2, MoS2, and MoB, are proved to be alternatives for Pt catalyst due to their low costs and impressive HER catalytic performance [39–41]. Particularly, Mo2C shows highly effective electrocatalytic properties for HER under pH-universal conditions [23,42–45]. For example, Cui et al. prepared Mo2C nanoparticles decorated graphitic carbon sheets (Mo2C/GCSs) as\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.060 Received 21 November 2018; Received in revised form 12 December 2018; Accepted 18 December 2018\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

Lu et al. reported Mo2C-embedded nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets (Mo2C@2D-NPCs) with a low overpotential for HER in alkaline solution in which the strong interaction between Mo2C and NPC reduces the energy barrier for water splitting [47]. Recently, our group also obtained a Mo2C quantum dot embedded N-doped graphitic carbon layer (Mo2C QD/NGCL) with outstanding HER catalytic activity and stability at all pH values [48].\nIn this work, we report a MOF-based approach to prepare Co-NC@ Mo2C complex with integrated advantages of Mo2C and Co-NC for water splitting. The as-prepared catalyst is Mo2C coated derivations of carbonitride and Co nanoparticles (NPs), where the coating structure of Mo2C not only protects the inner layer of Co NPs from electrolyte erosion, but also provides more metal and carbon contact sites. Benefiting from the excellent bifunctional catalytic property, Co-NC@ Mo2C shows outstanding catalytic activities in both HER and OER in an alkaline electrolyte. When employed as electrocatalysts for both anode and cathode in an overall water electrolyzer (1.0 M KOH), a cell voltage of only 1.685 V at 10mA cm−2 and long-term durability (20 h) is achieved, which functioning the Co-NC@Mo2C as a versatile electrode for efficient overall water splitting."

Ag/AgCl (KCl saturated) was used as the reference electrode for the acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) electrochemical measurements. Hg/HgO was used as the reference electrode for the alkaline (1.0 M KOH) electrochemical measurements. Graphite plate was used as the counter electrode in above measurements. The reference electrode was corrected with regard to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in all measurements, and the scan rate of obtaining polarization data was kept at 5mV s−1. Pt wire was used as the working electrode in the high purity hydrogen saturated electrolyte for calibration. With the 5mV s−1 scan rate of current-voltage, the average value of two potentials of zero crossing current is taken as the thermal dynamic potential of H-electrode reaction. The catalyst Co-NC@Mo2C loaded on GCE was used as both cathode and anode in a two-electrode configuration for overall water splitting. The LSV curves were obtained at a scan rate of 5mV s−1 and chronoamperometry experiments were conducted at applied bias voltage of 1.69 V for 20 h. All polarization curves were IR-corrected. The amount of H2/O2 generated in the H-type electrolytic cell was collected by the water drainage method. The watersplitting device uses carbon paper as electrodes (2×2 cm) precoated with Co-NC@Mo2C."

      "heading" : "3. Results and discussion",
      "text" : "The synthesis procedure for Co-NC@Mo2C is illustrated in Fig. 1a. ZIF-67 (or ZIF-8) was prepared according to the reference [49]. As shown in Fig. 1b (Fig. S1 and S2), ZIF-67 displays a rhombic\ndodecahedron structure and a size of around 500 nm with a smooth surface. Then, the same mass of ZIF-67 and ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate was ground together. ZIF-67 was wrapped by ammonium molybdate and the surface becomes rougher (Fig. 1c and Fig. S3) compared to pristine ZIF-67. After carbonized under high purity argon atmosphere, Co ions from ZIF-67 were reduced to form Co NPs, and the organic moiety could form carbonitride surrounding the Co NPs. Meanwhile, ammonium molybdate was converted into Mo2C with possible chemical reactions as follows [50]:\n(NH4)6·Mo7O24·4H2O = 7MoO3+ 6NH3+ 7H2O (1)\n2MoO3+ 4C = Mo2C+ 3CO2 (2)\nwhere, firstly, ammonium molybdate is decomposed into ammonia, MoO3 and water. Then the resulting MoO3 reacts with the carbon skeleton of ZIF-67 and generates Mo2C. It can be seen clearly from the\nSEM images (Fig. 1d and Fig. S4) and TEM images (Fig. 2a and Fig. S5) that Co-NC@Mo2C still keeps the rhombic dodecahedron structure, although some carbon skeletons collapsed probably due to the water production and consumption of C in the chemical reactions. From the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image (Fig. 2b), its surface shows clear lattice fringes with interplanar distance of 0.149 and 0.228 nm, corresponding to the (110) and (101) crystal planes of the Mo2C nanoparticles, respectively. It is difficult to see the outline and lattice fringes of Co nanoparticles clearly when Mo2C wrapped the Co-NC. However, Co nanoparticles with the lattice fringes corresponding to (111) plane can be seen faintly in those collapsed structures, as shown in Fig. S6.\nThe EDX spectrum (Fig. S7) and elemental mapping (Fig. 2c) reveal the existence of Co and Mo in Co-NC@Mo2C. Besides, from the distribution of Co and Mo in elemental mapping figures, we can find that the Co element only concentrates in the inner part of carbon frameworks, whereas the Mo element is distributed in the edge, which further\nconfirms the encapsulation of Mo2C on the surface of whole carbon skeleton. In addition, the results of Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) test also indicate the existence of Co and Mo element in Co-NC@Mo2C (Table S1).\nIn the control experiments, NC@Mo2C was obtained by the same method except ZIF-67 was replaced by ZIF-8, while the pyrolysis derivations of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 under high purity argon atmosphere was NC and Co-NC, respectively. The surface of Co-NC (Fig. S8) is very smooth, and ZIF-8 (Fig. S9) shows a similar structure to ZIF-67 and Mo2C wrapped around carbon framework in NC@Mo2C (Fig. S10), as a normal encapsulated structure.\nFrom the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results in Fig. S11, NC shows disappearance of all the sharp peaks of the pristine ZIFs. Instead, a new broad peak emerges at 2θ=22.6°, due to agraphitic C diffraction, which indicates there are little graphite domains presented in the samples [51]. Compared with NC, another obvious diffraction peak is observed at 2θ=44.37° for Co-NC and 2θ=39.49° for NC@Mo2C, indexing to (111) plane of Co (JCPDS No. 01-1255) [52] and (101) plane of Mo2C (JCPDS No. 11-0680) [53], respectively. For Co-NC@ Mo2C, it has one broad peak and two strong diffractions peaks, corresponding to agraphitic C diffraction, Co (111) and Mo2C (101), respectively. As shown in Fig. S12, Co-NC@Mo2C possesses the D peak (1582 cm−1) for sp2- hybridized carbon and G peak (1330 cm−1) for lattice defects of a typical carbon material with a low degree of graphitization. Besides, it has additional peaks assignable to the Mo-coupling phases and doped Co-species [23,31].\nThe X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results of Co-NC@ Mo2C indicate the existence of Co, Mo, C, N, and O elements (Fig. S13a) with the atomic ratio of 6.94%, 13.41%, 19.64%, 28.57%, and 31.45%, respectively (Table S2). The Mo 3d spectrum (Fig. 2d) displays two pairs of peaks (Mo 3d5/2/3d3/2) at binding energies of 232.6/235.6 and 228.5/231.7 eV, attributed to surface-oxidized MoOx caused by the exposure to ambient atmosphere [46] and Mo2C, respectively [47]. The spectrum of Co 2p (Fig. 2e) can be deconvoluted into three major peaks located at 781.3, 778.5 eV for Co 2p3/2 and 797.3 eV for Co 2p1/2, respectively. The peak of Co 2p3/2 in 781.3 eV can be further split into subpeaks of Co3+ (780.9 eV) and Co2+ (782.1 eV). The peak of Co 2p3/2 in 778.5 eV indicates the existence of a metallic state of Co. [54–56] Two additional shake up satellite peaks are also observed at binding energy of 803.1 and 786.6 eV, which indicates the oxidized surface species owing to exposure to the atmosphere. [31,57] The deconvoluted C 1s binding energy spectrum can be demonstrated as three peaks, corresponding to C˭C/C-C (284.6 eV), C˭N (285.4 eV) and C-N (288.7 eV) bonds, respectively (Fig. S13b) [48]. Two peaks of the N 1s spectrum (Fig. S13c) can be ascribed to pyridinic N (397.7 eV) and graphitic N (399 eV), respectively [50], while the pyridinic N is the main nitrogen species in Co-NC@Mo2C, which is good for the HER because the lone electron pair in the plane of the carbon matrix can elicit electron and active hydrogen [51].\nTo evaluate the electrocatalytic behavior, samples were investigated by linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) in alkaline solution (Fig. 3a), the overpotentials for Co-NC, NC@Mo2C, NC and commercial Mo2C are 340mV, 173mV, 545mV and 238mV (at the current density of 10mA cm–2), respectively, while Co-NC@Mo2C at 700℃ (Fig. S14) displays much better catalytic activity (η@10mA cm−2 =99mV) than the contrast samples except the commercial Pt/C. As shown in Fig. 3b, the Tafel slope of Co-NC@Mo2C (65mV dec−1) is around 4mV dec−1, lower than the Pt/C (20 wt%) (69mV dec−1) and much lower than the other catalysts used in this study (demonstrated in Table S3). When CoNC@Mo2C was operated for stability test (Fig. 3c), the LSV curves of the 1st and 1000th cycle almost overlap, and the current density has 87.7% retention after 25 h, demonstrating the higher stability of Co-NC@Mo2C compared with commercial Pt/C (Fig. S15a) in alkaline medium.\nDue to the acid corrosion of Co NPs, the HER performance of common carbon-supported Co NPs catalysts is not good under acidic conditions [38,58,59]. However, in such a reversed encapsulation\nstructure, Co NPs are protected by Mo2C in this work, so Co-NC@Mo2C still shows an outstanding catalytic activity in 0.5M H2SO4 aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. 3d, although commercial Pt/C still shows the best performance (η@10mA cm−2 = 35mV). Co-NC@Mo2C also performs well (η@10mA cm−2 = 143mV), which is much better than the Co-NC (526mV), NC@Mo2C (179mV), NC (500mV) and commercial Mo2C (394mV) as well as other catalysts reported (Table S4). Meanwhile, it shows a small Tafel slope (60mV dec−1) (Fig. 3e) and better electrocatalytic stability than commercial Pt/C (Fig. S15b), where the current density has around 81% retention after 25 h and little reduction after 1000th cycles (Fig. 3f). After the durability tests, the XPS spectra (Fig. S16) of Co-NC@Mo2C were collected, and the strength of peaks for Mo2+ corresponding to Mo2C weaken after HER stability test in acidic solution (Fig. S16b), which indicates Mo2C in Co-NC@Mo2C is the main participant in HER and the loss of Mo2C during the reaction results in the decrease of catalyst performance. Besides, the peaks corresponding to the metallic Co state disappear after stability test(Fig. S16c), showing that a small amount of Co nanoparticles on the surface were consumed during the reaction. Yet, there is only a slight decrease about the elemental atomic ratio of Co and Mo after durability test (Table S5), and the XRD patterns before and after stability test (Fig. S17) shows no obvious change. In addition, the SEM image (Fig. S18) indicates that the sample almost maintains the pristine morphology. These confirm that Co-NC@Mo2C has a good HER stability in acid media.\nThe capacitive currents of Co-NC@Mo2C (Fig. S19a), Co-NC (Fig. S19b) and NC@Mo2C (Fig. S19c) were measured in a potential range between −0.60 to −0.50 V without faradic processes. The differences in current density variation at the potential of −0.55 V plotted against scan rate were fitted. As seen from Fig. S19d, the capacitance of CoNC@Mo2C, Co-NC and NC@Mo2C is 85.82, 43.80 and 57.74 mF cm−2, respectively, which is consistent with their HER performances.\nThe OER performance of catalysts in 1.0M KOH aqueous solution is shown in Fig. 4. In contrast to Co-NC (η@10mA cm−2 = 375mV), NC@Mo2C (η@5mA cm−2 =524mV) and other reported similar catalysts (Table S6), Co-NC@Mo2C (η@10mA cm−2 = 347mV) has a great performance, which is comparable to commercial IrO2 catalysts (η@10mA cm−2 = 316mV) (Fig. 4a). The OER performances of NC@ Mo2C and commercial Mo2C (η@10mA cm−2 = 518mV) suggest that pristine Mo2C has little catalytic activity in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solutions, which further proves that the excellent OER activity of Co-NC@ Mo2C is because of the unique structure and synergetic effects of Mo2C and Co-NC. The Tafel slope (Fig. 4b) of Co-NC@Mo2C (61mV dec−1) is much lower than the other catalysts used in this study (demonstrated in Table S3), and around 27mV dec−1 lower than the commercial IrO2 (88mV dec−1). When Co-NC@Mo2C was operated at overpotential of about 350mV in a 1.0M KOH aqueous solution, it shows more excellent electrochemical stability compared with commercial IrO2 (Fig. S20a) with 73% retention after 20 h and 10mV potential attenuation after 1000th cycles (Fig. 4c).\nThe point diagram of the Tafel slope and the overpotential/voltage corresponding to 10mA cm−2/5mA cm−2 of all catalysts are shown in Fig. S21. Co-NC@Mo2C shows an outstanding HER and OER performances. Thus, we assembled an electrolyzer by using Co-NC@Mo2C as electrocatalyst in 1.0M KOH aqueous solutions. LSV curves were collected (Fig. 4d) and obvious H2 and O2 bubbles can be observed (inset in Fig. 4d). It delivers a voltage of 1.685 V at 10mA cm−2, which is only around 67mV worse than the commercial IrO2-Pt/C catalyst, comparable to that of the excellent catalyst reported (Table S7). The corresponding Tafel slopes (Fig. 4e) are also consistent with the results of LSV curves. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4f, the system remains 79.2% catalytic performance at 1.69 V after 20 h and around 18mV reduction of the current density after 1000th cycles, which is superior to commercial IrO2-Pt/C catalyst (Fig. S20b).\nThe amount of H2/O2 generated in the H-type electrolytic cell based on Co-NC@Mo2C catalyst was collected by the water drainage method (Fig. 5a and Fig. S22). Figs. 5b–e (or Figs. 5f–i) reveals the volume of H2\n(or O2) generated by the cell. The electrolyte is separated by Nafion membrane (Fig. 5j), and the bubbles can be clearly seen on carbon paper (Figs. 5k and l). The Faradaic efficiency is demonstrated to be close to 100% for overall water splitting with the H2 to O2 volume ratio of 2.13:1 (considering the influence of device air tightness), approaching the theoretical value of 2:1 during electrolysis (Fig. 5m). This result manifests that Co-NC@Mo2C is indeed an efficient and durable electrocatalyst toward water splitting."

      "text" : "In summary, we successfully synthesized Co-NC@Mo2C (Mo2C coated derivations of carbon nitride and Co NPs). The reversed encapsulation effect of Mo2C not only protects the normal electrocatalytic reaction of carbon-supported Co NPs, but also provides more metal sites for reaction, and ultimately enhances the catalytic performance of the whole catalyst. Compared with other reported similar catalysts, CoNC@Mo2C shows not only excellent HER electrocatalytic performance in acid (η@10mA cm−2 =143mV in 0.5M H2SO4) and alkaline (η@ 10mA cm−2 = 99mV in 1.0 M KOH) solutions, but also great OER\nelectrocatalytic performance in alkaline solutions (η@10mA cm−2\n= 347mV in 1.0M KOH). This bifunctional catalytic property allows Co-NC@Mo2C to be used as an outstanding catalyst for efficient water splitting. Our study opens up a new way for the design of MOF derived catalysts to obtain multifunctional catalytic performance."

    "abstractText" : "Developing low-cost, highly active, and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts is a challenging issue in electrochemical water electrolysis. Herein, we develop a simple metal organic frameworks (MOFs) based approach to prepare bifunctional Co-NC@ Mo2C complex catalysts. Differently from traditional carbon encapsulated functional nanomaterials, herein the carbon-based framework derived carbonitride and Co nanoparticles (Co-NC) are encapsulated with Mo2C. Benefiting from the unique reverse-encapsulation structure and synergetic effects of Mo2C and Co-NC, the Co-NC@Mo2C catalyst shows superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. In alkaline media, it affords the current density of 10mA cm at low overpotentials of 99mV and 347mV for HER and OER, respectively. Interestingly, due to a reversed encapsulation structure where Co nanoparticles are protected by Mo2C, it leads to an outstanding HER catalytic activity (a low overpotential of 143mV) and stability in acidic solutions. Remarkably, when employed as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.685 V is required to reach the current density of 10mA cm in alkaline media with excellent stability, making the Co-NC@Mo2C an efficient non noble metal bifunctional electrocatalyst toward water splitting.",
