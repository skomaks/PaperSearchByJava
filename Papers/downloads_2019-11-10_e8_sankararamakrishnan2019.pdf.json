Cellulose nanofibres (CNF) acts as a template and stabilizer and prevents agglomeration of FeS/MgS nano particles. MgS present in the nano-composite provides a barrier to suppress aerial oxidation of Fe(II) and provided additional source of sulfide ions. An adsorption capacity in the order of 142.8mg/g of the bionano composite was exhibited towards hexavalent chromium. Both FeSCNF and FeMgSCNF followed pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics with regression coefficients >0.96. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies indicated that decontamination of Cr(VI) follows the route of electrostatic attraction, ion-exchange followed by reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) and immobilization of Cr(III) as chromic oxide and Fe-Cr mixed oxide. Toxicity characteristics leaching tests revealed the efficacy of immobilization. Finally the developed sorbents were successfully applied to the removal of chromium from tannery waste effluents.\n© 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

      "text" : "With the steady rise in industrialization and global population, contamination and pollution have been inevitable, compromising clean water. Contamination of water bodies from anthropogenic sources is the major cause for deteriorating public health. WHO\nrishnan).\n(World Health Organization) (Guidelines for drinking-w, 2017) and USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) (USEPA, 1995) have prescribed very low permissible limits for heavy metals discharge especially Cr(VI) due to carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic effects to human health and lives even at low concentration (USEPA, 1995; PRC, 1996). Numerous advanced methods including membrane filtration (Muthumareeswaran et al., 2017), chemical surface precipitation (Zhou et al., 2018), electrodeposition (Yao et al., 2013), reverse osmosis (Padilla and Tavani, 1999), ion exchange (Shi et al., 2009) are reported for their\nremoval. However, these methods are found to be either inefficient or expensive (Zhong et al., 2016) and some methods also result in high sludge production (Choi et al., 2018). Thus, the desire to supply efficient technology coupled with economic feasibility still has wide scope. In recent years, iron nano particles including iron oxide (Shen et al., 2016) iron sulphide (Patterson et al., 1997; Mullet et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2014; Gong et al., 2014, 2016; Lyu et al., 2017) zerovalent iron (Zhou et al., 2014) have been employed to treat Cr(VI) contamination. However, the challenges that are faced are agglomeration, difficulties in recycling due to their small size, lack of selectivity and chemical reactivity in aqueous medium and lack of stability (Echigo et al., 2012; Chauhan et al., 2014). Thus twomain problems needs to addressed: (1) effective dispersion of nano particles to enhance reactivity and prevent agglomeration, (2) stabilizers to prevent aerial oxidation of Fe(0) or iron sulfides, thus enhancing their reactivity towards the concerned pollutant. Various stabilizers like carboxymethyl cellulose (Gong et al., 2014), yeast extract (Roy et al., 2015), starch (He and Zhao, 2005), alginate (Wu et al., 2017) have been used. FeS is a non-toxic and ubiquitous mineral. Under anoxic environments, FeS can be easily prepared by co-precipitation (Gong et al., 2016). Hence, it has been found useful for the abatement of contaminated soil and groundwater with various pollutants like chromium (Mullet et al., 2004), arsenic (Wolthers et al., 2005), mercury (Skyllberg and Drott, 2010) and uranium (Hyun et al., 2012). Especially in the present study to address Cr(VI) contamination FeS would be very useful as both Fe2þ and S2 species could serve as reducing agent to reduce toxic Cr(VI) to non-toxic Cr(III) (Patterson et al., 1997). However, the main challenge in using FeS is preventing aerial oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) and agglomeration of FeS nanoparticles.\nThus in the present study to address the above mentioned problems, FeS/MgS nanoparticles will be embedded in cellulose nanofibres and used for Cr(VI) removal. Cellulose fibers derived from agrowaste sugarcane bagasse have gained remarkable attention owing to variety of factors including low coefficient of thermal expansion, superior mechanical strength, high specific surface area, etc. Cellulose nanofibres acts as a stabilizer and organic framework for holding iron sulfide nanoparticles without agglomeration and MgS, where Mg ions will act both as a stabilizer and barrier to suppress oxidation of Fe(II) and provide additional source of sulfide ions. Thus the present study involves the preparation, characterization and evaluation of Fe/MgS doped cellulose nano fibers towards decontamination of Cr(VI). Systematic characterization using various spectral techniques, batch studies, kinetics, toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) will be carried out. Mechanism of interaction will be postulated using XPS as a tool and finally the applicability will be demonstrated by using the adsorbent for the removal of Cr(VI) from tannery waste effluents."

Analysis of Cr(VI) was carried by widely used spectophotmetric method using diphenyl carbazide as chromogenic reagent (APHA, 1995). Total chromium concentrations in the samples were determined by Thermo inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS).

Further the inset depicts the TEM image of FeS/MgS which shows nanowire like structures. Further adsorption of Cr(VI) is evident from the SEM image (Fig. 1b). SAED pattern of FeMgSCNF (Fig. 1c) revealed the diffused ring pattern confirming the amorphous nature of FeS/MgS doped on the fibres. Presence of Fe, Mg, S and Cr is evidenced in EDAX plot of Cr(VI) loaded FeMgSCNF (Fig. 1d).\nFig. 2a shows the infrared transmission spectra of FeSCNF and FeMgSCNF. The eOH str of cellulose monosaccharide units was observed around 3430 cm 1 in both the FeSCNF and FeMgSCNF. An absorption band at 2930 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching vibrations of O-CH3 molecules from the small amounts of lignin in nanofibres (Nada et al., 1998). Symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of S-O group were observed at 1115 and 1014 cm 1 respectively (Mikhlin et al., 2000). Bands arising from Fe-O stretching vibration was observed in both the spectra at 550 cm 1 (Sankararamakrishnan et al., 2014). Furthermore absorption bands due to non-dissociated molecules of water was observed at 1640 cm 1 (Babou et al., 1995).

      "text" : "In order to understand the mechanism of interaction of prepared adsorbents with hexavalaent chromium, XPS spectra of virgin and Cr(VI) loaded sorbents were analyzed. The results obtained from these spectra are tabulated in Table 1.\nFe 2p peaks of FeSCNF and FeMgSCNF before and Cr(VI) loading are shown in Fig. 3a and b respectively. The concentration of Fe(III) species was found to be higher (61.2%) in FeSCNF as compared to FeMgSCNF (17.9%). This could be due to the fact that the surrounding Mg ions suppress direct oxidation of Feþ2 to Feþ3 and act as a barrier for ion and electron transfer (Liu et al., 2016). Furthermore, MgS undergoes hydrolysis (eqn. (2)) and the resultant product prevents the air oxidation of Fe(II).\nMgSþ 2H2O/MgðOHÞ2 þ CO2/MgðOHÞCO3 (2) Thus formed Mg(OH)CO3 preserves Fe in þ2 state and thus enhanced activity was observed in the FeMgSCNF towards Cr(VI) removal (Table 2).\nFe 2p peaks FeSCNF and FeMgSCNF could be deconvoluted to 2 major peaks of 2 p3/2 and 2p1/2 around binding energies 708 and 723 eV respectively. Further Fe 2p3/2 depicted twomajor peaks. The one centered around 708.2 eV (FeSCNF) and 708.9 (FeMgSCNF) corresponded to Fe(II)-S/Fe(II)-O bonds (Descostes et al., 2000; Boursiquot et al., 2002) and the other peak corresponded of Fe(III)O peaks at binding energies 710.5 eV (FeSCNF) and 711.2 eV (FeMgSCNF). After Cr (VI) loading oxidation or Fe(II) occurred which resulted in increased concentration of Fe(III) ions (Fig. 3b). Oxidized products of Fe, corresponding to FeOOH (711.0 eV), Fe2O3 (723.8 eV) and Fe3O4 (723.9 eV) were observed. Furthermore, in the case of Cr (VI) loaded FeSCNF complete oxidation of Feþ2 to Feþ3 species was observed as compared to Cr(VI) loaded FeMgSCNF (Table 1). This again could be attributed to the protective covering of Mg which prevents complete oxidation. The S(2p) spectrum of FeSCNF (Fig. 4a) exhibited only one peak at 161.1 eV which corresponds to monosulphide species (Pratt et al., 1994). However in FeMgSCNF, S2p3/2 could be deconvoluted to two peaks at 161.1 and\nI) loaded FeMgSCNF, c. SAED pattern of FeMgSCNF, d. EDAX plot of Cr-FeMgSCNF.\n166.6 eV which corresponds to monosulfide (Pratt et al., 1994) and polysulfide (Kim et al., 2011) respectively. Thus initially addition of thiosulfate leads to insitu generation of hydrogen sulfide. The formed hydrogen sulfide reacts with Fe(II) and Mg to form the respective monosulfides which further reacts to form polysulfides (Wilkin and Barnes, 1996) as shown below.\n2S2O 2 4 þ H2O/2HSO 3 þ S2O 2 3 (3)\nS2O 2 4 þ S2O 2 3 þ 2Hþ þ 2H2O/H2Sþ 3HSO 3 (4)\nTable 2 Model constants for isotherms and kinetics of FeSCNF and FeMgSCNF and Cr(VI) System.\nAdsorbent Isotherm Constants Kinetics Constants\nLangmuir Freundlich Pseudo First Order Pseudo Second Order\nQ(max) (mg/g) b R2 1/n Kf R2 kL (min 1) qe (mg/g) R2 k2’ (mg/g/min) qe (mg/g) R2\nFeSCNF 66.70 0.028 0.987 0.712 2.480 0.981 4.61 10 3 23.01 0.988 4.0 10 5 47.61 0.989 FeMgSCNF 142.80 0.029 0.989 0.754 4.860 0.990 6.9 10 3 34.43 0.967 7.89 10 5 50.00 0.980\nFig. 4.

The 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 centered at 585.2± 0.1 and 575.5± 0.1 ev respectively, with a spin orbit coupling of 9.7± 0.1 eV which is indicative of Crþ3 compounds (Mullet et al., 2004; Lyu et al., 2017; Allen et al., 1974). Further deconvolution of 2p peaks of Cr(VI) loaded FeSCNF indicated the formation of Cr(III) oxide (575.5 and 585.2 eV), mixed oxides of Fe(III)-Cr(III) (577.5 ev) (Lyu et al., 2017) and CrO2 (587.7ev) (Dai et al., 2000). The percentage of Cr(III)oxide, mixed Fe(III)-Cr(III) oxide and CrO2 were found to be 81.5, 11.2 and 7.3% respectively. However, in the case of Cr(VI) loaded FeMgSCNF, all the adsorbed Cr(VI) were converted to Cr(III) oxide.\nThus it could be concluded that initially electrostatic interaction occurs between ferrous cation and chromate anion followed by redox reaction resulting in complete transformation of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). The redox potential of Cr(VI)/Cr(III) (E0¼1.35 V NHE) is higher than FeS (E0¼ 0.47 V NHE) (Bokare and Choi, 2011). Hence transfer of electrons occur from FeS conduction band to surface sorbed hexavalent chromium resulting in spontaneous reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) and oxidation of FeS to iron oxides and oxyhydroxide as well as oxidized products of sulfur ion.\nFurther XRD spectra of FeMgSCNF (Fig. 4d) did not reveal any sharp peaks owing to the amorphous nature of sulfides formed on cellulose nano fibers. However, Cr(VI) laden FeMgSCNF exhibited diffraction peaks corresponding to Cr2O3 (PDF -2No.38-14791), iron oxides (Hou et al., 2007).\nThus the following mechanism is postulated. Initially dissolution of FeS/FeS2 takes place in acidic medium (eqn (9)) followed by electrostatic interaction of cationic ferrous iron and anionic chromate ion (eqn (10)). Thus this attraction helps in the diffusion of chromate ions from the bulk of the aqueous solution to the surface. This is followed by the redox reaction leading to Cr(III), Fe(III) and oxides of sulfur (eqns (11)e(14)) (Yang et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2012). From XPS spectra we observed the evidence for the formation of mixed oxides of iron and chromium. This is the resultant of ion exchange reaction as shown in eqn (15) (Mullet et al., 2004).\nFeSþ Hþ/Fe2þ þHS (9)\nFe2þ þ HCrO 4 /Fe2þ HCrO 4 ðElectrostatic Interaction=SorptionÞ (10)\nHCrO 4 þ 3Fe2þ þ 7Hþ/Cr3þ þ 3Fe3þ þ 4H2O (11)\n2HCrO 4 þHS þ 7Hþ/2Cr3þ þ SO 2 3 þ 5H2O (12)\n3HCrO 4 þ 8HS þ 29Hþ/8Cr3þ þ 3SO 2 4 þ 20H2O (13)\nHCrO 4 þ 7Hþ ! 3e 4H2Oþ Cr3þ (14)\nx Cr3þ þ ð1 xÞFe3þ þ 3H2O/3Hþ þ CrxFeð1 xÞðOHÞ3 (15)"

      "text" : "Initial solution pH effect on the adsorption of Cr(VI) by FeSCNF and FeMgSCNF were carried at pH values 5-9. pH values lower than 5 were not carried out due to instability of iron sulfides (Rickard, 2006). The results indicate that uptake of Cr(VI) is strongly dependent on pH (Fig. 5a). This observation is similar to earlier research on amorphous FeS2 (Li et al., 2016), calcium polysulphide (Chrysochoou and Ting, 2011) and pyrites (Graham and Bouwer, 2012). The observed trend could be attributed to the reduced dissolution of Fe or MgS at higher pH values and competition from hydroxyl ions which inhibits the initial electrostatic interaction of Cr(VI).\nEquilibrium kinetics were performed with FeSCNF and FeMgSCNF with an initial Cr(VI) concentration of 50 ppm. The concentration of Cr(VI) adsorption with time is shown in Fig. 5b. It is evident that for both FeSCNF and FeMgSCNF equilibrium reached after 6 h of equilibration. It is reported that Cr(VI) reacts with sulfide containing compounds (Li et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2007) following first order kinetics. In this work pseudo first and second order kinetics were utilized to determine the Cr(VI) immobilization by both FeSCNF and FeMgSCNF. The formula used for pseudo first and second order models (Ho and McKay, 1999) is represented in equations (16) and (17) respectively.\nlogðqe qtÞ ¼ logqe þ k\n0 1\n2:303 t (16)\nt qt ¼ 1 k 0 2qe þ t qe\n(17)\nwhere qt and qe represents the amount of Cr(VI) adsorbed at given time t and equilibrium respectively. Pseudo first and second order rate constants are represented by k1’ and k2’ respectively. Obtained values for the both the models are presented in Table 2. From the data it is apparent that the systems followed both pseudo first and second order model with regression coefficients >0.96.\nIn Fig. 5c, the sorption isotherms were fitted into both Langmuir and Freundlich models (Table 2). For Cr(VI) sorption by FeSCNF and FeMgSCNF, the amount adsorbed shows a gradual increase with equilibrium concentration, and reached a plateau. FeMgSCNF exhibited higher Langmuir adsorption capacity compared to FeSCNF. This could be attributed to the role ofMgS in preventing the aerial oxidation of Feþ2 to Feþ3 which in turn increased the adsorption of Cr(VI). A comparisonof iron based adsorbents towards the removal of Cr(VI) is listed in supporting information S1. It is evident that the proposed adsorbents exhibited higher capacity compared to magnetite coated activated carbon (57.4mg/g) (Liu et al., 2012), Fe@Fe2O3Core-Shell Nanowires (7.8mg/g) (Zhang and Qiu, 2008) Fe(0) supported biochar (10.6mg/g) (Zhou et al., 2014) and comparable with the recently reported work on the removal of Cr(VI) by FeS coated biochar (150mg/g) (Lyu et al., 2017)."

      "heading" : "3.4. TCLP leaching tests, recyclability and application to tannery wastewater",
      "text" : "To study the extent of leachability of Cr (VI) loaded FeMgSCNF, an extended TCLP test (Isenburg et al., 1992) was conducted. The Cr(VI) loaded FeMgSCNF was equilibrated for 24 h with aqueous solution with varying initial pH namely: 3.06, 3.66, 4.18, 5.33 and 6.35. While FeMgSCNF had 3100 mg Cr g 1 of dry adsorbent, the concentration of total Cr in the leachate ranged from 100 to 12.57 mg/L in the pH range of 3.06e6.35 (Fig. 5d). According to EPA, the TCLP limit for chromium is 5mg/l (Anon). Thus it could be concluded that chromium is immobilized and it is safe to dispose loaded FeMgSCNF in landfills. Similarly, in a recent study (Li et al., 2017) TCLP tests revealed that carboxymethyl cellulose stabilized FeS particles reduced total Cr and Cr(VI) in the leachate to 98.4 and 99.4% respectively.\nRecyclability studies were conducted with both FeSCNF and FeMgSCNF. Initially 0.1 g of the adsorbent was equilibrated for 16 h with 20ml of 50 ppm of Cr(VI) solutions at pH 5. After equilibration, the filtrate was analysed for Cr(VI) and the adsorbent was washed with water and equilibrated with 0.01 N NaOH for 1 h for desorption of adsorbed Cr(VI). After desorption, the sorbent was washed with water and the cycles for adsorption and desorptions were repeated for five cycles. The results obtained are shown in Fig. S1 (Supporting information). It is evident the FeMgSCNF performed better compared to FeSCNF and the adsorption decreased from 100% to 32% at the end of five cycles. Desorption using acidic solutions were not resorted due to the instability of FeS under these conditions. Decreased adsorption capacity in subsequent cycles using alkaline solutions as desorbent could be attributed to the increased surface electron negativity and aggravated formation of oxides which leads to reduction in Cr(VI) uptake.\nThree different tannery effluents were acquired from nearby tanneries in Kanpur, U.P. India. Characteristics of the acquired\neffluent are listed in Table S2 of the supporting information. The concentrations of total chromium ranged from 110 to 157 ppm. Around 10ml of the effluent were equilibrated with 0.1 g of nanofibers for 16 h after adjusting the pH to 5. It should be noted that the effluent contained very high amounts of total dissolved solids and COD in the range of 6000e20,000mg/l. Concentration of total Cr was determined by ICPMS after suitable dilutions. From Table S3 (Supporting information), it is unambigous that both the prepared adsorbents were effective in reducing the concentration of total chromium to less than 1 ppb effectively."

Thus the Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity towards Cr(VI) for FeMgSCNF (142.8mg/g) was found to be higher than FeSCNF (66.7mg/g). XPS and XRD studies affirmed the formation of chromic oxide and Fe-Cr mixed oxides after adsorption. Further it was observed that all the adsorbed Cr(VI) were effectively converted to Crþ3 by FeMgSCNF. Further the developed adsorbents effectively reduced chromium concentrations from ppm levels to ppt levels. Nevertheless, FeMgSCNF exhibited great potential in decontamination of hexavalent chromium from polluted aqueous streams."
