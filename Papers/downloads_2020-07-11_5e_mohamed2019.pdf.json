The tribological and rheological characteristics of nano grease with a new design of automated lubricant machine tests were evaluated. In this paper, a manual Reicher test machine is converted to an automatic machine by an electric actuator, which used to convert the load from manual to automatic. Calcium grease containing a different concentration of titanium dioxide and carbon nanotubes TiO2/CNTs (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 wt. %) was successfully prepared. The tribological and rheological characteristics of the nano grease were investigated under different temperatures. The morphologies and chemical composition of the worn surface and the wear mechanisms were also discussed at different loads. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis were used to analyze the microstructure of the nano additives and nano grease. The result shows that the optimal concentration of TiO2 /CNTs was 3 wt%, which reduces the wear and coefficient of friction about 72.3 and 60 %, respectively. Furthermore, the apparent viscosity and shear stress are increased by 48.2 and 74.2 %, respectively.\n© 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Lubricants help to minimize friction and wear in contacting surface in order to reduce friction and minimize power loss. In certain situation, lubricants fail to satisfy their lubricating properties. In order to improve the attributes of lubricants, nanotechnology offers the opportunity for improving the performance of lubricant oil using nano additives [3,4]. The addition of nanoparticles to base oil will enhance the certain characteristic of lubricant oil, such as improving friction, wear resistance, load carrying capacity, thermal properties, and rheological properties [5,6]. Therefore, attention has been paid by many engineering designers to investigate the wear\nn open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://\n. 2 0 2\nb s t a y t l p s r a t i c s t t s n\nl d l i t i t h d a f\nn t t o u a u a f b [ w l e c t G d b s i t c m a ( i [\nj m a t e r r e s t e c h n o l\nehavior of materials under different operating parameters uch as applied load, sliding distance, velocity, [7,8], and he contact conditions mechanism such as point, line, and rea [9–12]. Furthermore, rheological characteristics such as ield stress, shear thinning, dropping point, consistency and hixotropic behaviors are strongly related to structure. Rheoogical properties of grease and structure are two important arameters which define “grease properties”. Therefore, few tudies have been reported in the literature to improve the heological properties by adding an additive like nanoparticles nd thus to improve the greasing properties [13–15]. Moreover, he thermal conductivity of lubricant plays an important role n the transfer of heat during the contact parts in the lubriation process [16,17]. Therefore, suspending nano additives uch as graphene or carbon nanotubes, which possess high hermal conductivity increases the heat transfer in grease due o increased thermal conductivity [18]. Based on the compoition of nano additives and fluid, the thermal conductivity of ano grease may increase or decrease [19,20].\nOil analysis, is the laboratory analysis to determine a ubricant’s characteristics, pendent contaminants, and wears ebris. This analysis helps in forecasting the life of a particuar machine and hence the trends can be established, which ntern help eliminate costly repairs. In the past few years, here has been a major development in the mechanical field n general and the mechatronics field in particular to create he simplest way to control any testing mechanism without uman interference [21,22]. In this research, we are going to iscuss control mechanism evolution from manual test to utomatic test, which will reduce the errors that may occur rom human interference.\nTribology is a very important language of mechanical engieers, covering lubrication sciences, friction, and wear. Many ribological apparatus have been designed and standardized o study the wear behavior of materials by the development f nanocomposite greases technology and deepening the nderstanding of the particularity of functional nanomaterils and nanoparticles. Nanoparticles used as additives show nique thermal, physical and chemical properties and have\nbroad application prospect in lubrication. Nano additives or lubricant such graphene nanosheets(GNS) [23,24], caron nanotubes (CNT) [25–27], TiO2 [28–30], SiO2 [31,32], Al2O3 33,34], ZnS [35] and MoS2 [36–39] influence distinguished antiear properties, dropping point, extreme pressure and good ubricating performances. Many researchers investigated the ffect of GNS on the lubricating performance and the results leared that the friction coefficient, the wear scar diameter, he extreme-pressure (EP) properties improved with 3 wt. % NS. Additionally, the rheological properties of grease with ifferent concentrations of GNS cleared that non-Newtonian ehavior and the dropping point, apparent viscosity and shear tress improved by 17, 52, and 65 % respectively, with increasng GNS nanoparticles [23,24]. Bahaa et al. [40,41] studied the ribological and rheological characteristics of calcium grease ontaining carbon nanotubes. They reported that the optium concentration of the CNTs in the nanocomposite was bout 3 wt. % and the friction coefficients, wear scar diameter WSD), shear stress and apparent viscosity were significantly mproved with the addition of nanoparticles. Hui Wu et al. 28] studied the influence of TiO2 on the tribological proper-\n0;9(2):2054–2062 2055\nties of water-based lubricant and the results show that the optimal percentage of TiO2 was 0.8 wt. %, which demonstrates excellent tribological properties.\nCNTs have attracted much interest due to their remarkable mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical and optical properties [19,42]. CNTs are able to mitigate friction and wear in loaded contacts due to their shape, high aspect ratio, and high flexibility. In addition, previous studies reported that TiO2 has good friction-reducing, anti-wear, and cooling properties, so it can reduce the coefficient of friction and wear [43,44]. Therefore, recently researchers focused more on using a combination of two different nanoparticles in base oil or grease, which is state-of-the-art technology [45–47]. However, no investigation has been conducted yet on the combination of CNTs and TiO2 on the Tribological and rheological properties [48–50]. It is well known that nanocomposites usually show superior characteristics compared to the characteristics of each individual component due to the synergetic effects of more than one type of nanoparticles [51–53].\nThe aim of the present work is to update a new version of automated lubricant machine test, which converting control mechanism from manual test to automatic test, that will reduce the errors that may occur from the human interference. The hybrid nano additives TiO2 /CNTs reinforcing a calcium grease with different concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 wt. %) were investigated. Besides, the microstructure of these nano grease, the coefficient of friction, wear scar diameter, flow properties, consistency and dropping point of newly formulated greases are investigated."

The basic differences between these techniques are the contact mechanism (area, line or point contact) of the tested material. The testing machine basically consists of a rigidlymounted test roll, which is pressed against a revolving friction wheel by means of leverage. The friction wheel is immersed with its lower third in the sample under test. Its rotating speed is at a rate that ensures that a sufficient quantity of lubricant will always get to the contact surface of the test roll and the friction wheel. Due to the crosswise arrangement of the axles, an elliptical wearing surface will be formed, the size of which will grow corresponding to the operating time elapsed. The extension of the wearing surface results in a decrease of the specific surface pressure between friction wheel and test roll, whereby a load-carrying lubricant film will be built-up. Additionally, in this machine, the automated load is used instead of the manual load by setting an electric actuator that will move linear downwards and the test piece is attached at the end of the actuator, which will touch the oil that is rolling on the friction disc until it breaks.\nj m a t e r r e s t e c h n o l . 2 0 2 0;9(2):2054–2062 2057\nLubr\ne c c v t t a o a w T m m\n3\n3\nT p c i o i fi p\n3\nT w t 1 c r T a t [\nFig. 2 – Automated\nAn electric linear actuator is powered by a motor to convert lectrical energy into torque.

It’s evident that the slope of the line increases with increasing different concentration of TiO2/CNTs from 0.5 to 4 wt%, that is observed in many articles [62,63], but the improving at concentration 4 wt% is unsatisfactory.

    "abstractText" : "The present work deals with the development of nanocomposite grease to reduce friction and wear between two contact surfaces such as the components of engine, cams, gears, and bearing. The tribological and rheological characteristics of nano grease with a new design of automated lubricant machine tests were evaluated. In this paper, a manual Reicher test machine is converted to an automatic machine by an electric actuator, which used to convert the load from manual to automatic. Calcium grease containing a different concentration of titanium dioxide and carbon nanotubes TiO2/CNTs (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 wt. %) was successfully prepared. The tribological and rheological characteristics of the nano grease were investigated under different temperatures. The morphologies and chemical composition of the worn surface and the wear mechanisms were also discussed at different loads. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis were used to analyze the microstructure of the nano additives and nano grease. The result shows that the optimal concentration of TiO2 /CNTs was 3 wt%, which reduces the wear and coefficient of friction about 72.3 and 60 %, respectively. Furthermore, the apparent viscosity and shear stress are increased by 48.2 and 74.2 %, respectively. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the",
