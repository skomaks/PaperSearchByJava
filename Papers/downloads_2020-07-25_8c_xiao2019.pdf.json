In this study, micro-nano-engineered nitrogenous biochars derived from cow bone meal pyrolyzed at different temperatures and were engineered with the assistance of a ball-milling technique. The ball-milled bone biochars were natural composites combined with plant biochars and hydroxyapatite components on the micro-nanoscale. Both the micropore area and the external specific surface area of the bone biochars were significantly improved after ball-milling. The sorption capacities for heavy metal ions were heavy metal ions were MBC-600>MBC-450>BC-600>MBC-300>BC-450>BC300, consistent with the variation tendency in the specific surface areas of the bone biochars. The adsorption capacities of MBC-600 for Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) were 165.77, 287.58 and 558.88 mg/g, respectively (T 298K, pH 5.0), representing increases of 93.91.%, 75.56% and 64.61% compared with the un-milled preparation. Surface complexation, cation exchange, chemical precipitation, electrostatic interaction and cation-π bonding were responsible for the removal of heavy metal ions by bone biochar materials.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Anthropogenic activities such as mining, metallurgy, electroplating and chemical manufacturing inevitably release heavy metal ions (HMs, e.g., Cd(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), and other heavy metal elements) into the natural environment, resulting in serious threats to ecosystems and to human health (Xu et al., 2019a, b; Zou et al., 2016). Because of their non-biodegradability, their continuous bioaccumulation and their high toxicity, HMs are hazardous, and they easily concentrate in living organisms, causing long-term damage to humans and other species through the food chain and increasing the risk of various human diseases and disorders such as cancer, liver and kidney damage and hypertension (Duruibe et al., 2007; John et al., 2012). The maximum allowable concentrations of Cd2+, Cu2+ and Pb2+ in drinking water have been set by the World Health Organization at 0.003mg/L, 2.0mg/L and 0.01mg/L, respectively (WHO, 2011). Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate hazardous heavy metal ions from polluted water to improve the ecological environment and human health.\nTo date, a variety of conventional and advanced techniques, including chemical precipitation (Meunier et al., 2006), electrochemical treatment (Peydayesh et al., 2019), solvent extraction (Jean et al., 2018), ion exchange (Nekouei et al., 2019), membrane filtration membrane (Shariful et al., 2018), reverse osmosis (Vital et al., 2018) and adsorption (Li et al., 2003), have been utilized to safely dispose of contaminated water. Among those methods, adsorption is considered an attractive and effective method based on its good adaptability, ease of operation and relatively low cost. Many ordinary functional materials, including natural mineral materials and synthetic nanomaterials, have been extensively used in HMs purification. The development of cost-effective and sustainable sorbents is still the primary challenge to the overarching goal of water environment security.\nBiochar is a byproduct that is produced by the thermal decomposition of waste carbon-rich residuals (i.e., crop and wheat straw, wood biomass, waste sludge, poultry waste, and other materials) under oxygen-limited conditions (Ahmad et al., 2014; Park et al., 2011; Qin et al., 2018). Compared to typical commercially produced activated carbon, biochar is regarded as a potentially cheap, sustainable and alternative adsorbent for the remediation of HMs based on its broad applicability in practice and its beneficial physicochemical properties, including available surface area, developed porosity and surface functional groups with good capability of adsorbing various compounds (Mohan et al., 2014). Nevertheless, the use of pristine biochars is limited by several intrinsic disadvantages, including the scarcity of their surface functional groups and their large particle size, which limits their removal efficiency in environmental remediation and reduces the feasibility of their use to remove highly concentrated pollutants. To that end, various chemical modification methods, including acid and alkali activation, metal salt activation and nanoparticle loading materials, have been adopted to further their performance (Hu et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015a, b; Jung et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2019a, b). For instance, Wang et al. (2015a) reported that engineered biochar that had been activated by KMnO4 showed a significantly improved capability to remove HMs from aqueous solutions compared with pristine biochar. In another study, manganese ferrite/biochar composites were synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal chemical process; these composites also showed high performance in the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated wastewater (Jung et al., 2018). Although most of the chemical modification methods used to obtain effective biochar-based composite materials are comparatively simple and reliable, these methods still have various drawbacks such as high cost, requirement for harsh experimental conditions (i.e., strict control of pH, pressure and temperature) and plenty usage of toxic chemicals. Furthermore, to make biochar a useful material in engineering application, greater surface area and smaller size of the material need to be achieved (Liu et al., 2018). Thus, it is urgent to seek a green, effective and low-cost method of producing functional biochar for the practical\nelimination of HMs. Ball milling, a feasible and promising synthesis technique, has numerous advantages; it is environmentally friendly, can be used for large-scale production, and has broad adaptability and has been widely used in industrial grinding to produce various materials on different scales (Lyu et al., 2017; Peterson et al., 2012). Several studies have shown that ball milling can greatly influence the structure and surface properties of biochar, which determine its capacity for adsorption of various pollutants in the aquatic environment. For example, Lyu et al. (2018b) reported that ball-milled BM-biochar, which had greater specific surface area and larger pore volume, showed improved removal efficiency of Ni(II) compared to bare biochar in aqueous solutions. Cao et al. (2019) explored methods of obtaining effective biochar derivate from wheat straw by a ball-milling technique and showed that the Pb (II) adsorption capacity of the material can reach 134.68mg/g. Not only that, the use of ball-milled biochar with increased external and internal surface area for galaxolide and methylene blue removal resulted in excellent sorption performance compared with pristine biochar (Lyu et al., 2018a; Zhang et al., 2019).\nIn general, biochars produced from different types of biomass possess very different chemical structures. Bone biochar has gained considerable attention in environmental management due to the distinct components and structures that enable their favorable properties, such as its low cost, ease of preparation, high adsorption capacity, acid-base adjustability, ion-exchange capability, thermal stability and biocompatibility (Goto and Sasaki, 2014; Ibrahim et al., 2019; Vamvuka et al., 2018). Compared with conventional biochar, bone biochar has high pollutant removal capability; this can be attributed to its principal characteristics such as its textural properties and its hydroxyapatite content, which can be applied to purify HMs by complexing with phosphate and hydroxyl groups in aqueous solution (Buehler, 2006). For instance, Park et al. (2015) reported that the maximum amount of Cu(II), Cd(II) and Zn(II) adsorbed by chicken bone biochar was 130mg/ g, 109mg/g and 93mg/g, respectively, which is superior to most of conventional biochar such as the biochar derived from hickory wood, bamboo feedstock and sesame straw (Wang et al., 2015a; Park et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018a, b). The bone biochar also has a low negative impact on the environment and human health compared with other waste-based adsorbents such as aluminum oxide-amended wood char (Yami et al., 2015). Thus, the bone-based biochar shows a great potential for large-scale application in the removal of HMs from aqueous solution. In addition, according to reports issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a globally significant increase in meat consumption has led to the production of large amounts of bone meal waste by the meat industry (OECD, 2018; Alkurdi et al., 2019). Hence, the high-value utilization of waste bone resources is also particularly important for environmental protection and sustainable development.\nTo the authors’ knowledge, a comprehensive evaluation of the suitability of ball-milled bone biochar materials for environmental applications has not been reported. Therefore, in the present study, cow bone meal pyrolyzed at different temperatures was ball-milled to obtain micro-nano-engineered nitrogenous biochar for removal of Cd(II), Cu (II) and Pb(II) from aqueous solution. The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to study the effect of pyrolysis temperature and of the use of ball-milling technology on bone biochar surface composition and structure; (2) to investigate the sorption of Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) to ball-milled and pristine bone biochar in macroscopic sorption experiments under conditions involving multiple environmental factors and to analyze the results using kinetic and isotherm models; (3) to explore the underlying mechanisms of HM binding to bone biochar samples; and (4) to evaluate the potential application of ball-milled bone biochar in the remediation of HMs in water."

Surface texture and morphology of the samples were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Quanta 200FEG, Thermo scientific Quanta, USA). The organic elemental compositions (C, N, H, S) for bone biochar samples were measured using Elemental analyzer (EAI CE-440, USA). The amounts of other main elements in the bone biochar samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS, Thermo Scientific ELEMENT 2/HR) after being digested with a mixture solution containing 65% HNO3 and 30% H2O2 and then being further diluted.

The adsorption kinetics was investigated by dispersing 0.10 g adsorbents into 200mL aqueous solution containing Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) with different initial concentrations (i.e., 50, 50 and 120mg/L) under pH=5.0, I =0.01mol/L NaNO3 and T=298 K. Adsorption experiments were performed in a series of 10mL centrifuge tubes and carried out in an orbital shaker (HNY-100B, Honour instrument shaker, Tianjin, China) with oscillation frequency of 160 rpm/min. In brief, at dosage of various adsorbents, the effect of pH values, ionic strength and temperature were investigated by varying the solution pH (2–7), NaNO3 concentration (0–0.25mol/L) and temperature (298–328 K), respectively, and the initial Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) concentrations in the aqueous solutions were 50, 50, 120mg/L. The solution pH was adjusted by negligible volume of 0.001∼0.1 mol/L HNO3/NaOH solutions. The adsorption isotherm experiments were carried out by vigorously shaking 10mL of different HMs solution (Cd(II) and Cu(II) from 5 to 200mg/L, Pb(II) from 5 to 400mg/L) mixed with 5.0 mg BCs and MBCs for 24 h to reach equilibrium at pH=5.0, I =0.01mol/L NaNO3 and T=298 K. After the sorption experiment equilibrium achieved, the supernatants were filtrated with 0.22mm filter membrane and measured the Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) concentration (Ce, mg/L) by flame atomic absorption spectrometry(FAAS, AA-6880, Shimadzu, Japan). The sorption capacity (qe, mg/g) were calculated from the initial (C0, mg/L) and final equilibrium concentration (Ce) of metal ions as well as the adsorbents dosage (m/V, g/L) of the uptake system with the following equation:\n= − ×q C C V m ( ) e e0\n(1)"

      "text" : "The particle sizes and surface morphologies of pristine and ballmilled bone biochar are shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen in Fig. 1(a, e, i), BC-300, BC-450 and BC-600 appeared as inhomogeneous particulate matter with irregular geometry. The images magnified at 100,000 × provided detailed information (Fig. 1(b, f, g); the surface morphology of the material was compact and relatively smooth, and the surface of the BCs become more fragmented and looser as the pyrolysis temperature increased. Conversely, the ball-milled BCs grains appeared as rough, ultrafine particles of comparatively uniform size at the micro-nanoscale (Fig. 1d, h, l), suggesting that ball milling effectively breaks the granular pristine bone biochars into superfine particles. Preliminary studies of ball-milled general biochar were also conducted, and similar results were obtained for biochars originating from plant waste (Lyu et al., 2018b; Cao et al., 2019).\nN2 adsorption-desorption analyses were conducted to measure the basic structural properties of the BCs and MBCs (Fig. 2a). The isotherms of BCs and MBCs were typical IUPAC type-IV with an H3 hysteresis loop, showing that all the adsorbents have a mesoporous structure; this is consistent with the measured average pore diameter of 6.46–14.48 nm (Table 1) (Jung et al., 2019). The specific surface area (SSA) values of the MBCs were all larger than those of the corresponding un-milled biochars (Table 1). The pristine bone biochars prepared at 300 °C, 450 °C and 600 °C had lower SSA (2.76–52.78 m2/ g), and the SSA increased to 35.49–313.09m2/g after ball milling. The SSA of both BCs and MBCs increased when the pyrolysis temperature was increased from 300 to 600 °C; this could be ascribed to the presence of exposed pores generated by the release of volatiles from the biochar matrix (Kloss et al., 2012). The results were confirmed by determination of the elemental composition parameters of BCs and MBCs (Table 1). The weight percentage of the volatile organic elements C, N and S displayed an apparent decrease, while that of the solid elements Ca and P increased slightly. The contents of C (wt.%) and N (wt.%) decreased insignificantly from in the carbon content, the decreased from 45.53% to 43.68%, 42.21% to 40.21%, 39.49% to 39.11% and 4.59% to 4.35%, 4.25% to 4.04%, 3.42% to 3.46% for the BCs and MBCs with different pyrolysis temperatures, respectively. The slight decrease C (wt%) might be attributed to the structures of oxygen containing groups (C]O, such as ester group and carboxyl group etc.) have been disrupted and the small fused-ring aromatics, aliphatic C and carboxyl C in the biochar-DOC or the tar particles released to aqueous solution in the pores of biochar during the wet ball-milling process (Xu et al., 2019a, b; Lyu et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2019a, b). As for N (wt%) in the BCs and MBCs, the slightly reduced can be caused by the dissolved the tiny amounts of soluble pyridine and sparingly soluble pyrrole during the wet ball-milling process due to the increasing the external surface area and opening the internal pore of biochar. As also shown in Table 1, the contents of Ca (wt%), P (wt%) and O (wt%) in the bone biochars with same pyrolysis temperature before and after ball-milling show no significant variation, which are consistent with the stability of the HAP in the deionized water solution and the slightly changed of the other elements in the bone biochar and ball-milled samples. Moreover, the external and micropore SSA and the average pore volume of the BCs also showed an obvious increase after ball-milling, and the samples prepared at higher temperatures displayed greater increases in these parameters. The results are likely due to the fact that ball-milling disposal does not merely increase the biochar’s external surface area by decreasing the grain size but also increases its internal surface area by exposing the pore networks (Lyu et al., 2018a). However, the average diameter of the particles was inversely related to the pyrolysis temperature; this can be attributed to the rapid improvement in the microporous SSA, which resulted in a smaller value after averaging. Of all the bone biochar samples, MBC-600 showed the highest SSA and the\nlargest pore volume. The surface functional groups of BCs and MBCs were identified via FT-IR analysis; the corresponding spectra are presented in Fig. 2b. The broad band centered at ∼ 3420 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of OH groups in all bone biochar samples and hydroxyapatite (HAP); OH groups are the representative functional groups of the\nbiochar and HAP (Piccirillo et al., 2017). The visible peaks at 2926 and 2853 cm−1 in BC-300 correspond to the CeH stretching vibrations of the methylene group (Jung et al., 2019). However, the CeH peaks decreased in intensity or disappeared in the other samples prepared at high pyrolysis temperatures and by ball-milling disposal; this may be ascribed to the fact that those preparation conditions would be likely to\nbreak the specific groups. The specific peaks observed in BCs and MBCs at ∼1640, ∼1470 cm−1 and ∼1209 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibrations of aromatic C]C/C]O, aromatic C]O and CeO, respectively. Moreover, the peaks at 1425 and 1633 cm−1 for the HAP are likely due to stretching vibrations of eCOO or CO32−originating from the adsorption of atmospheric CO2 (Fernando et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018a, b). Specially, the several peaks indicating vibrations in the range of 450–1100 cm−1 can be attributed to the tetrahedral PO43− groups in all BCs and MBCs (Wang et al., 2018a, b; Kousalya et al., 2010). The adsorption peaks at 1040 cm−1 and 473 cm−1 are attributed to ν3 PeO stretching vibration and ν1 symmetric PeO stretching vibration, respectively. The bands at 964 cm−1, 606 and 564 cm−1 correspond to ν2 OePeO bending vibrations and ν4 OePeO bending vibrations (Jung et al., 2019).\nAs shown in Fig. 2c, the phase purity and the crystalline structure of BCs and MBCs prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures were also examined by XRD analysis. The recorded diffraction peaks 2θ at 25.94°, 31.83°, 39.58°, 46.66°, 49.55° and 53.21° correspond to the (002), (211), (130), (222), (213) and (004) reflection peaks of hydroxyapatite (Reference code 00-001-1008) (Wang et al., 2018a, b; Zhu et al., 2018). In addition, compared with the spectrum of bare HAP, the other special diffraction peaks shown in BCs and MBCs at 20.69°, 26.72° and 29.22° are attributed to the presence of amorphous carbon, which is a component of general carbon-rich biochar (Jung et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2012). The intensity and sharpness of the characteristic special diffraction peaks shown above were greater in the samples that had undergone more intense heating, indicating that more amorphous carbon was converted to aromatic carbon in those materials. Besides, comparing the XRD of the BCs and MBCs, the significant reduced in the specific diffraction peaks at 20.69°, 26.72° and 29.22° (Fig. 2c), indicated that the crystalline of amorphous carbon was destroyed by the wet ball-milling process. There are no obvious changes in the intensity and sharpness of the characteristic diffraction peaks of HAP for both BCs and BMCs, suggested the HAP displayed a great stability in the ballmilled disposal and confirming the results of elements analysis.\nThe average particle size distribution and the dispersion behavior of BCs and MBCs in aqueous solutions were investigated. As shown in Fig. S1, the particle sizes of the un-milled BCs were all in the micron range (1–20 μm), and the particle size decreased with higher temperature. The MBCs were all within the range of micro- and nanomaterials (0.1–2.5 μm), and the particle size of MBC-600 was less than 1000 nm. It can be confirmed that the BCs were altered and that their particle size was reduced from the millimeter to the submicron scale, whereas that of the MBCs was reduced to the micro-nanoscale. The dispersion behavior of the BCs and MBCs was also explored (Fig. 2d). The MBCs were better dispersed in DI water than their pristine counterparts. The unmilled samples (BC-300, BC-450 and BC-600) settled or floated within ∼30min, while the ball-milled ones (MBC-300, MBC-450, and MBC600) displayed good stability in solutions after 48 h. This phenomenon can be attributed to the adsorbent’s physical and chemical characteristics, such as the particle size and the quantity of functional groups exposed on the surface. The pioneer studies and our FTIR results suggested that more surface functional groups (i.e., carboxyl groups, lactonic groups and phenolic hydroxyl groups) exist on the surface of milled bagasse biochar; the presence of these groups can introduce strong repulsive electrical double layer forces that prevent the aggregation of the submicron MBC particles (Lyu et al., 2018a; Zhang et al., 2019).\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is used to determine the valence state of chemical elements by analyzing the energy distribution of photoelectrons. As shown in Fig. 3a, the characteristic peaks of the main elements in conventional biochar and HAP, such as C, O, N, Ca and P, appeared on the full- scale XPS spectrum of BCs and MBCs. In addition, the surface group characteristics of BCs and MBCs pyrolyzed at different temperatures were analyzed in detail (Fig. 3b, c, d); the results are shown in Table S1. As illustrated in Fig. 3b and Table S1, the\nhigh-resolution C1s spectra reveal three peaks, that is, ∼284.2 eV for CeC and C]C bonds, 285.5 eV for CeO and CeN bonds, and ∼288.4 eV for C]O bonds (Uchimiya et al., 2012). Moreover, the highresolution O1s and N1 s can also be divided into different peaks, i.e., the P]O/C]O bonds at ∼531.2 eV, the PeO/CeO bonds at ∼533.0 eV, pyridinic-N at ∼398.9 eV, and pyridonic-N at ∼399.9 eV (Fig. 3c, d) (Yuan et al., 2017; Ling et al., 2017). The elements of the BCs show no obvious changes with preparation conditions, while the relative areas of the C1s, O1s and N1s characteristic peaks appear diverse. More specifically, according to the relative areas of the peaks, the total percentage of CeC and C]C bonds, CeO and CeN bonds and C]O for BC-300, BC-450 and BC-600 decreased from 74.26% to 69.02%, from 21.67% to 22.89%, and from 4.57% to 8.09%, respectively. As for O1s and N1s, the proportions of P]O/C]O bands and pyridinic-N show a slight increasing tendency, while the PeO/CeO bands and pyridonic-N display a reverse variation as the pyrolysis temperature is increased. The above results show that the more stable chemical surface groups such as C]O, P]O and pyridinic-N are present in the BC-600 due to the thermal decomposition of meat proteins and fatty acids into ester C]O esters, aliphatic alkyl groups, and aromatic C]O and eOH groups at high charring temperatures (Bekiaris et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2008). Moreover, as also displayed in the Fig. 2b, c and d, the C1s, O1s and N1s characteristic peaks of the bone biochar appeared evident changes after the ball-milling. For C1 s and O1 s XPS of the BCs and MBCs, the dramatic change of the atomic ratio in C]O and P]O/C=O, reduced from 4.57%∼8.75% to 1.70%∼1.75% and 79.26%∼86.63% to 65.57% to 78.33%, respectively. There results were mainly attributed to the structures of oxygen containing groups (C]O, such as ester group and carboxyl group etc.) and some dissolved materials in the DI water, which were disrupted during the wet ball-milling process. The ratio of pyridinic-N in the BCs was about 26.59% ∼ 44.49% and then decreased to 20.20% ∼ 32.06% for MBCs, indicating that the more soluble pyridine dissolved in the aqueous solution than the sparingly soluble pyrrole during the wet ball-milling process. The results also line with the slightly decreased N (wt%) in MBCs by the elements analysis. Therefore, the bone biochars derived from cow bone meal not only contained abundant oxygen-containing groups but also had plentiful pyridinic-N and pyridonic-N functional groups. The results of physicochemical property analysis indicated that the BCs and MBCs were a composite containing the characteristic functional groups of hydroxyapatite and conventional biochar components derived from agricultural, forest residues and industrial by-products; these functional groups would be expected to provide a variety of available binding sites for concentrated HMs in aqueous solution."

      "heading" : "3.2. Adsorption kinetics",
      "text" : "The sorption kinetics data of HMs on BCs and MBCs are presented in Fig. 4. The adsorption reactions between BCs and MBCs and HMs proceed rapidly at the initial stage and then gradually slow down as sorption equilibrium is reached. The sorption equilibrium time for Cd (II) and Cu(II) adsorption to the BCs and MBCs is 200min, while Pb(II) requires only 90min to reach equilibrium. The observed differences in the sorption kinetic behaviors of the HMs may be ascribed to the nonuniformity of the processes involved in the adsorption of different HMs to various adsorption sites, which include HAP phases and oxygencontaining and nitrogen-containing functional groups on the surface of the bone biochar (Wang et al., 2015a, b; Chen et al., 2010a, b). Thus, a contact time of 24 h was selected to ensure sorption equilibrium in the following batch experiment.\nKinetic models, including a pseudo-first-order model (Fig. 4a–c) and a pseudo-second-order model (Fig. 4d–f), were also fitted to the adsorption data to provide insight into the potential sorption mechanisms. Based on the correlation coefficients (R2) and calculated qe values (Table S2), the pseudo-second-order model was found to be more appropriate for fitting the adsorption kinetic data. Generally, data that\nconform to a pseudo-second-order model reflect a rate-limiting step such as chemical sorption that occurs through valency forces involving the sharing or exchange of electrons between the sorbent and the sorbate. Thus, the adsorption of Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) to the adsorption sites of BCs and MBCs was mainly controlled by chemical reactions, including ion exchange, surface complexation and/or precipitation, rather than physical absorption (Hu et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2017)."

      "heading" : "3.3. Effect of solution pH and ionic strength",
      "text" : "The pH is one of the most important environmental factors to consider when evaluating the potential application value of a material because it influences the material’s surface charge, its sorption capacity and the HMs species present in aqueous solution. The pH-dependent trends of Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) adsorption to BCs and MBCs are illustrated in Fig. 5(a, b, c). The zeta potentials of BCs and MBCs are displayed in Fig. S2; the pHpzc (point of zero charge) values are in the range of ∼2.0∼ 3.1, following the order MBC-600<MBC450<MBC-300<BC-300<BC-450<BC-600. The decrease in the zeta potential of ball-milled adsorbents compared with that of the raw biochars suggests that ball-milling can effectively reduce the positive charge of biochar by exposing numerous functional groups on the material, an effect that is beneficial to the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions. As can be seen in Fig. 5a–c, HM sorption capacity increases as the pH is increased from 2.0 to 7.0, and the sorption\namounts of MBCs are markedly higher than those of un-milled BCs, especially in the case of MBC-600. When pH < pHpzc, numerous H+ or H3O+ ions occupy the active sites, creating a positively charged adsorbent; this weakens the nucleophilicity of the functional groups and produces electrostatic repulsion towards metal ions, resulting in decreased adsorption capacity of BCs and MBCs (Zhao et al., 2011). When pH > pHpzc, the negatively charged surface of the BCs and MBCs exhibits a significant electrostatic attraction to the positive charges of the heavy metal species in the aqueous solutions. On the other hand, the protonation degree of functional groups of the materials decreases with increasing pH, allowing more oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing sorption sites to easily occupy the empty orbits of HM atoms, thereby greatly promoting the formation of complexes. As also presented in Fig. S3, the species of HMs (i.e., Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II)) present under the experimental conditions used were predicted using Visual MINTEQ 3.1 (Gustafsson, 2018). The dominant species of Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) in aqueous solution at pH=2∼7 are positively charged hydrated cations, i.e., Cd2+, Cu2+/Cu2(OH)22+/Cu3(OH)42+, and Pb2+/PbOH+/Pb3(OH)42+/Pb4(OH)44+, respectively. No heavy metal hydroxide precipitation occurred, indicating that the HMs were anchored on the MBCs and BCs by the active sorption sites themselves. Moreover, compared with pristine bone biochar before and after ballmilling, ball-milled biochars had significantly higher sorption capacities for HMs than un-milled biochars prepared at the same thermal decomposition temperatures, and MBC-600 showed the best adsorption\nperformance. The high-efficiency improvement in the HM sorption capacities of the biochars can be attributed to the ball-milling technique and to the elevated pyrolysis temperature, both of which increase the specific surface area and release relatively more functional groups on the surface of the material and within it.\nGenerally, the adsorption behaviors observed at different ionic strengths can be used to assess the underlying mechanisms through which HMs are adsorbed to BCs and MBCs in a water environment. As shown in Fig. 5(d, e, f), the effect of ionic strength over the range 0.01 to 0.25mol/L on the performance of the adsorbents was studied. It can be clearly seen in Fig. 5(d, e) that the amount of Cd(II) and Cu(II)\nadsorbed to BCs and MBCs decreased as the initial concentration of NaNO3 increased. The apparent dependence of sorption on ionic strength indicates that cation exchange (with Ca2+ or other cations) and/or outer-surface complexation (via electrostatic interaction) are the main immobilization mechanisms for Cd(II) and Cu(II) adsorbed on the BCs and MBCs (Wang et al., 2015a, b; Jung et al., 2018). In contrast, the addition of increasing amounts of NaNO3 to the solution has little or no evident effect on the sorption of Pb2+, suggesting the dominant interaction mechanism in this case is chemical precipitation and inner-surface complexation (El-Bayaa et al., 2009). The above results were confirmed by measuring the dynamic sorption behaviors of the HMs to\nBCs and MBCs."

      "heading" : "3.4. Adsorption isotherm and thermodynamics",
      "text" : "Adsorption isotherm studies play an important role in measuring the mobility or retention of HMs on the solid-phase interfaces of adsorbents. As shown in Fig. 6(a, b and c), sorption isotherms for Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) binding to BCs and MBCs were obtained at various concentrations. All the HM sorption isotherms display a conventional Ltype curve with a visible platform, indicating the possible occurrence of homogeneous or heterogeneous precipitation during the sorption process. Moreover, the sorption isotherm curves of Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) on MBC-600 were higher than those of the other adsorbents, and the MBCs also showed greatly increased sorption capacities compared with BCs prepared at the same pyrolysis temperatures.\nTo thoroughly evaluate the potential adsorption capacity and mechanism, the adsorption equilibrium data were analyzed using two diff ;erent isotherm models: the Langmuir model (Eq. (4)) and the Freundlich model (Eq. (5)). Fitted plots for the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models are presented in Fig. 6a–c, and the corresponding isotherm parameters are listed in Table 2. According to the determined values of R2, it is clear that the Langmuir model is more suitable than the Freundlich model; this indicates that the adsorption of Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) on BCs and MBCs was a completion of the chemisorption, which can be attributed to the energetically abundant binding sites present in these materials (Wang et al., 2015a, b; Bayramoglu et al., 2012).\nThe relationship of the surface area (SSA) of the BCs and MBCs to their sorption capacity for HMs are illustrated in Fig. 6d. The order of the N2-SSA of BCs and MBCs is MBC-600>MBC-450>BC600>MBC-300>BC-450>BC-300. Notably, the N2-SSA values of the test biochar samples were positively correlated with their sorption capacities for HMs (i.e., Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II)), suggesting that the SSA of the bone biochar samples has a significant influence on the sorption capacity. In the BCs, increasing the preparation temperature favors the decomposition of some oxygen-containing and nitrogencontaining ingredients, resulting in the generation of a relatively abundant pore structure. In contrast, ball milling can increase both the\nexternal and the internal surface areas of the biochar and relatively expose more of the oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing functional groups, which have lower hydrophobicity and higher polarity. All of these factors dramatically enhance the ability of the material to adsorb Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) in aqueous solution (Cao et al., 2019; Lyu et al., 2018a, b; Zhang et al., 2019). Thus, ball-milling disposal is an appropriate candidate for application as a practical method of obtaining engineered biochar with excellent physicochemical and sorption properties.\nThe influence of temperature (298–328 K) on the adsorption of Cd (II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) to BC-600 and MBC-600 is shown in Fig. 6e. The sorption of HMs increased with increasing temperature, suggesting that the sorption processes are endothermic. Increased temperature may\nincrease the amounts of HMs adsorbed by enhancing the interaction between the HMs and the adsorbents through the production of new sorption sites and through an increase in the adsorbate’s intraparticle diffusion rate into the pores of the BC-600 and MBC-600. To provide further insight into the interaction between the metal ions and the adsorbents, the thermodynamic parameters, including the enthalpy change (ΔH°), the entropy change (ΔS°) and the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°), were calculated from the slope and intercept of the van’t Hoff ; plots (ln Kd versus 1/T) in Fig. 6f (Eqs. (6)–(8)). The thermodynamic parameters for metal ion adsorption onto BCs and MBCs at 298∼338 K are listed in Table S3. The values of ΔG° are negative for the adsorption of all HMs onto BCs and MBCs, and the values become more negative when the temperature is increased from 298 to 328 K, indicating that Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) adsorption is spontaneous and that the adsorption reactions are thermodynamically favored. Furthermore, the ΔG° and ΔS° values obtained for MBCs were lower than those obtained for BCs, suggesting that more active and effective adsorption sites were generated in the adsorbents by ball-milling disposal (Ghodbane and Hamdaoui, 2008). The positive values of ΔH° also confirmed that the adsorption process was endothermic in nature. Thus, the thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption of Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) to bone biochar-based materials suggested that the sorption reactions are spontaneous and endothermic."

      "text" : "To elucidate the complexation form of the metal ions on the surface of adsorbents, FT-IR was performed for the pristine MBC-600 and HMsloaded MBC-600. As shown in Fig. 7a, the intensities of bands intensities corresponding to the v(−OH) vibration of hydroxyl groups decreased dramatically, and the positions of these peaks changed after the adsorption of Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II), indicating that the hydroxyl groups participate in the HM uptake process. In addition, the peaks at 1626 cm−1 (aromatic C]C and C]O) and 1090 cm−1 (C]O) show a slight shift after the complexation of the biochar with heavy metals. The intensities of peaks of eCOO (1453 cm−1), eOeH (1412 cm−1) and\nphosphate groups (1037 cm−1, 604 cm−1 and 563 cm−1) also exhibited a significant difference before and after the adsorption. Taken together, the data show that specific functional groups of MBC-600 undergo various changes after contacting Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) in aqueous solution and indicate the successful chemical binding of metal ions to the functional groups of MBC-600.\nThe XRD patterns of MBC-600 before and after the adsorption of Cd (II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) are shown in Fig. 7b. Except for the changes observed in the peak intensity, all the recorded XRD patterns are agreed well with the references of hydroxyapatite (HAP) and graphite phase carbon. Specifically, the XRD patterns obtained before and after Cd2+ and Cu2+ adsorption on MBC-600 show no significant changes, which might be ascribed to the low initial concentration of Cd2+ and Cu2+ ions and the relative abundance of carbon ingredients in the MBC-600 (Dybowska et al., 2009; Lei et al., 2019). In contrast, an obvious structural change in the pattern of Pb-loaded MBC-600, i.e., novel recorded diffraction peaks at 2θ=21.47°, 30.92°, and 43.76° corresponding to the reflection peaks of (PbxCa1‒x)5(PO4)3(OH) (Reference code 01-087-2477) (Zhu et al., 2018, 2016).\nThe possible formation of (PbxCa1‒x)5(PO4)3(OH) solid material can be attributed to the similar ionic radii of Ca(II) (0.99 Å) and Pb(II) (1.20 Å), which induces the replacement of Ca(II) with Pb(II) in the formation of the isomorphic solid. The mechanism was assumed to be a dissolution-precipitation mechanism (Eqs. (9) and (10)) (Mu et al., 2016), i.e.,\nCa5(PO4)3OH + H2O → 5Ca2+ (aq) + 3PO43− (aq) + 2OH- (aq) (9)\n5xPb2+ (aq) + 5(1-x) Ca2+ (aq)+ 3PO43− (aq) + 2OH- (aq) → (PbxCa1‒x)5(PO4)3(OH)+ H2O (10)\nXPS analyses of MBC-600 before and after HM adsorption were performed to provide more detailed information on the chemical changes that occurred on the surface of the samples (Fig. 7c). As shown in the full-scale spectra in Fig.7c, C 1s (285.78 eV), O 1 s (531.30 eV), N 1s (400.15 eV), Ca 2p (346.37 eV), and P 2p (132.74 eV) peaks are presented in the spectra MBC-600 samples. Notably, new strong double\npeaks for Cd 3d (405.10 eV), Cu 2p (935.24 eV) and Pb 4f (136.06 eV) appeared in MBC-600 after adsorption of Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II), respectively (Huang et al., 2018), proving that the HMs have been successfully adsorbed on the surface of MBC-600. The O 1s spectrum shown in Fig. 7d can be divided into two peaks, i.e., P]O/C]O (531.2 eV) and PeO/CeO (533.0 eV). The binding energy of O 1s on MBC-600 varied for Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) adsorption, indicating obvious interactions between HMs and oxygen-containing functional groups (Fig. 7d). Moreover, the peak area ratios of P]O/C=O and PeO/CeO exhibit apparent changes from 75.2% to 52.7%, 57.9%, 64.0% and 24.8% to 47.3%, 42.1%, 36.0% after Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) adsorption, respectively, showing that these O-donor functional groups play a significant role in HMs adsorption. The N 1s spectrum displayed in Fig. 7e can be divided into pyridinic-N (398.9 eV) and pyridonic-N (399.9 eV). The area ratio of the pyridinic-N peak changed from 45.6% to 39.5%, 29.4% and 38.6% after adsorption of Cd2+, Cu2+ and Pb2+, respectively, while that of the pyridonic-N peak increased from 54.4% to 61.5%, 70.6% and 61.2%, respectively, suggesting that both the pyridinic-N and pyridonic-N functional groups contributed to the capture of the HMs. The interactions between HMs with the abundant functional groups of MBC-600 including hydroxy, carboxyl and aromatic esters, pyridinic-N, pyridonic-N and phosphate groups should play an important role in the adsorption of HMs with high capacities.\nIn summary, the complexity of bone carbon materials after ballmilling leads to a multiple adsorption mechanism for the HMs on MBCs in the aqueous solutions. The potential mechanisms for Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) adsorption includes (Fig. 8): (a) cation exchange with inorganic components; (b) surface complexation between oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing groups(c) a dissolution-precipitation of HMs with the abundant HAP in MBC-600 (Lei et al., 2019); (c) electrostatic interactions between positively charged heavy metals and negatively charged MBC surfaces with oxygen-containing and nitrogencontaining functional groups in solution at different pH (Lyu et al., 2018a); (e) the aromatic/graphitic carbon in BCs and MBCs would coordinate HMs with π-electrons (Keiluweit et al., 2010)."

      "text" : "Based on the adsorption of the HMs on the pristine bone biochar and the demineralized bone biochar, the contribution of the several sorption mechanisms to the different metal ions were calculated. The contributions and sorption capacity of cation exchange (Qex), precipation (Qp), functional groups complexation (Qf) and cation-π (Qπ) for adsorbed\ndifferent HMs are presented in Fig. 9a and b. For Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb (II) adsorbed on BC-600, the contribution of Qp and Qex can be reach 40.15% (10.76mg/g) and 25.97% (6.85 mg/g), 46.31% (24.63mg/g) and 22.53% (11.98mg/g), 70.36% (136.72mg/g) and 9.63% (18.71mg/g) of the total sorption amounts of the HMs, respectively, while the Qf and Qπ offer relatively lower percentage of the heavy metal’s uptake. The larger contribution of precipitation and cation exchange for the HMs adsorbed may be ascribed to the ratio of HAP content was relatively higher in BC-600, which can offered large numbers of Ca2+ and PO43− to act with Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) in aqueous solution. Especially for the Pb(II), which can easier to form a precipitation of (PbxCa1‒x)5(PO4)3(OH) than the Cd(II) and Cu(II) in the form of (CdxCa1‒x)5(PO4)3(OH) and (CuxCa1‒x)5(PO4)3(OH), Cu3(PO4)2, the results was consistent with previous research on bone char and synthesized HAP (Chen et al., 2010a, b; Siebers et al., 2013; Lei et al., 2019). Besides, compared with BC-600, the contribution of the four sorption mechanisms of Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) adsorbed on MBC-600 showed an obvious change, the percentage of Qf changed form 20.37% (5.34 mg/g) to 29.68% (18.26mg/g), 19.24% (10.23mg/g) to 30.45% (22.08mg/g) and 12.21% (23.73mg/g) to 18.14% (36.06mg/g), while the Qπ declined from 13.17% (3.48mg/g) to 9.49% (5.84mg/g), 11.92% (6.34mg/g) to 9.53%(6.91mg/g) and 7.8% (15.16mg/g) to 7.58% (16.44mg/g), respectively. The results suggested that more oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing groups were exposed in the ball-milling process on the BC-600, which provided more abundant sorption sites to promote the contribution of the surface functional groups and sharply increase heavy metals removal compared to the original bone biochar (Lyu et. al., 2018a, b; Lyu et al., 2020). Although the sorption capacities of Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) on the MBC-600 showed a slightly increase, the contribution of cation-π displayed a decreased tendency, which might be attributed to its less dramatic elevated effect compared with other sorption mechanisms. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 9b, the adsorption capacity of MBC-600 was higher that of BC-600, confirming that the ball-milled disposal can further enhance the adsorption performance of BCs toward HMs in the aqueous solutions."

The maximum sorption amount (i.e., the qmax value derived from the Langmuir model fitting) of HMs on MBC-\n600 was carefully compared with those on other materials. As shown in Table S4, the removal performance of MBC-600 was vastly superior to that of raw biomass and various biomass waste-derived biochars such as oiltea shell (Liu et al., 2019a, b), rice straw biochars (Shen et al., 2019a, b), anaerobic digestion sludge and paper mill sludge biochar (Ho et al., 2017; Yoon et al., 2017), banana peel biochar and cauliflower leaf biochar (Ahmad et al., 2018), suggesting that the bone biochar produced from animal waste bone sources is more competitive in the concentration of HMs. Moreover, comparison with chemically modified biochar, composites and common nanomaterials showed that the amount of HMs adsorbed by MBC-600 was higher than that for activated carbon (Kyzas et al., 2019), H2O2-modified coconut fiber biochar (Wu et al., 2017), α-FeOOH nanorods impregnated biochar (Yang et al., 2018), hydroxyapatite/biochar (Jung et al., 2019), zero-valent iron nanoparticles (Eglal and Ramamurthy, 2015), HAP (Chen et al., 2010a, b), and magnetic GO-MgAl-LDH (Huang et al., 2018) but lower than that of nano- graphene oxide (GO) (Sitko et al., 2013). In addition, the ball-milled biochar originated from the bamboo feedstock (Wang et al., 2018a, b) and wheat straw (Cao et al., 2019) were applied to uptake Cd (II) and Pb(II) from aqueous solution, the sorption amount was significantly weaker than that of MBC-600 (Table S4). Thus, the excellent sorption performance of MBC-600 can possibly be ascribed to the native components of bone biochar and to the micro-nanoscale of the material. However, the maximum adsorption capacity of MBC-600 for HMs was lower than that of nano-GO, indicating that nanomaterials with nanometer-thin layers and numerous oxygen-containing groups can efficiently remove HMs. It should be emphasized that the potential use of nano-GOs is restricted due to their expensive and complicated synthesis and their negative ecological effects. Due to its multiple advantages, which include easy synthesis, low cost and high removal efficiency, MBC-600 is a promising candidate for the remediation of HMs-contaminated aquatic systems."

Among the tested materials, MBC-600 displayed the best and most efficient adsorption of HMs, largely due to its micro-nanoscale size and large specific surface area achieved by ball-milling and higher temperature pyrolysis. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms for the adsorption of HMs to MBC-600 fit well to the pseudo-second order model and the Langmuir isotherm, respectively. The dominant mechanism of\nadsorption of HMs to bone biochar includes surface complexation, cation exchange and precipitation, electrostatic attraction and cation-π; together, these events can be attributed to the presence of diverse functional groups such as oxygen-containing groups, nitrogen-containing groups and phosphate groups. Micro-nano-engineered nitrogenous bone biochar prepared using environmentally friendly, lowcost ball-milling technology appears to be a promising material for the remediation of HMs-bearing aquatic environments. Further investigations that explore the effect of ball-milled bone biochar on heavy metalpolluted soils and its influence on plant growth and physiology are needed.\nAuthor contributions\nProf. Chen and Dr. Hu. conceived the study and designed research; Dr. Xiao performed research and analyzed data; Dr. Xiao wrote the paper; Prof. Chen and Dr. Hu. were also revised the manuscript for the overall quality improvement\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."
