Thus, the need for its effective removal has become more crucial than before. Studies on graphene-based nanomaterials and their use in removing heavy metals are gaining tremendous traction over the past decade. The properties of graphene oxide (GO), such as large surface areas, desired functional groups and excellent mechanical properties are advantageous. Nevertheless, due to its tendency to agglomerate and difficulty in phase separation after treatment, the functionalization of GO using various materials of different surface functional groups is an ongoing study. The surface modification of GO is done by using various materials to introduce heteroatoms, which have high affinity for heavy metals. This review summarizes the utilization of different surface functional groups, such as oxygen-containing, nitrogen-containing, and sulphur-containing functionalized graphene oxide composites in the adsorption of cationic and oxyanionic heavy metals. The toxicity of these heavy metals is also addressed. Furthermore, the interactions between adsorbents and heavy metals which are influenced by pH and surface functional groups, are also discussed in detail. This is followed by the review in adsorption isotherms and kinetics. Future research needs are also offered.\n© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

      "text" : "Extensive applications of heavy metals in various technologies, such as medical, agricultural, and industries, have introduced open distributions of heavy metals in the environment, together with their negative impacts toward the community (Tchounwou et al., 2012). Major examples of heavy metals that bring about negative impacts are mercury, cadmium, chromium, lead, and arsenic (Wang and Chen, 2015). The toxicity of these metals depends on the route and duration of the metals’ exposure, as well as the absorbed dose of the metals (Jaishankar et al., 2014). They make their way into the human body through various routes, such as from fish and plants (Rajeshkumar et al., 2018). For instance, heavy metals that are dissolved in water have a higher tendency to be taken up by plants. This causes heavy metals to be bioaccumulated in the root and translocated to other edible parts of the vegetables, such as the stem, leaves, and fruits (Amin and Ahmad, 2015). Therefore, when humans consume fish and plants in their meals, heavy metals enter the human system directly and accumulate in the body, thus causing severe health problems. Due to the persistent existence of heavy metals along the food chain, the elimination of heavy metals in the water body has become imperative, as they could harm human beings as well as the environment. Therefore, numerous studies have been focusing on the removal of heavy metals from polluted water (Kumari et al., 2015; Huang, 2016; Rudd et al., 2016; Sahraei et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2018; Wan et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018; Shorie et al., 2019).\nTo date, extensive investigations on the technology of heavy metal removal in aqueous solutions comprise various methods. Some of the existing methods are coagulation, adsorption, membrane filtration, electrodialysis, oxidation, biological treatment, ion exchange, and photocatalysis (Carolin et al., 2017). Among all methods, adsorption is considered as one of the most popular and widely utilized techniques for heavy metal removal. The advantages of this method include its simplicity, ease of operation, lowcost, as well as neutrality to harmful compounds and toxic pollutants (Zhang et al., 2017). The research on discovering and developing highly reliable adsorbents has always been a crucial pursuit for it to be extensively applied in the industries and commercialized. Some well-known adsorbents targeting the removal of heavy metals include chitosan (Zarghami et al., 2016), zeolite (Zanin et al.,\n2017), activated carbon (Pap et al., 2017), carbon nanotubes (Xie et al., 2015), silica (Radi et al., 2019), and cellulose (Nongbe et al., 2018), among others. In general, these adsorbents are porous organic or inorganicmaterials, inwhich they have a high affinity for adsorbing heavy metals. Their performance in adsorbing heavy metals is usually enhanced through to the functionalization of adsorbents with other promising materials.\nIn the past few years, graphene-based materials have emerged as one of the most popular materials to be explored due to their unique properties. Graphene is a material which consists of a hexagonally arranged sp2 bonded single atom thick carbon sheet. Graphene can also be described as a single layer of graphite that is sp2 hybridized and arranged hexagonally (Eigler and Hirsch, 2014). Whereas, graphene oxide (GO) is the highly oxygenated monolayer graphite oxide resulting from the oxidation and exfoliation processes of graphene (Bianco et al., 2013). The application of GO has been extensively studied in various fields, such as in sensor and biomedical applications (Chen et al., 2018a; Huang et al., 2018d; Shahrokhian and Salimian, 2018; Palanisamy et al., 2019), electrochemical applications (Ambrosi and Pumera, 2016; Thiagarajan et al., 2017; Ramesh et al., 2018), photocatalysis (Iliev et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018), and pollutants removal (Robati et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018b; You et al., 2018).\nIn addition, there have been increased reports on heavy metal removal using GO-based nanomaterials (Sahraei and Ghaemy, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017, 2018b; Samuel et al., 2018). For the adsorption of heavy metals, GO has gained much attention due to its advantageous properties, such as having large specific surface areas and numerous amounts of oxygenated functional groups of great affinity toward heavy metal ions, such as carboxyl, hydroxyl and carbonyl groups (Huang and Pan, 2016; Sherlala et al., 2018b; White et al., 2018). Moreover, GO is also known to have high hydrophilicity, which means that it is highly soluble in aqueous solutions (Huang et al., 2018b). Although the hydrophilicity of GO ensures maximal interaction between the heavy metals and aqueous solution, it also causes difficulty in separation between the GO-based adsorbents and treated water after adsorption. In addition, the adsorption capacity of GO is mainly constricted to the limited amount of surface functional groups (Kong et al., 2019) and tendency to agglomerate after adsorption which lessens the performance of GO (Sitko et al., 2013). Therefore, the modification of\nGO using various other materials was addressed to overcome its drawbacks, to which the technique has been gaining momentum in the past few years. Owing to the numerous oxygenated functional groups on GO, this opens to abundant possibilities for the functionalization of GO (Smith et al., 2019).\nCurrently, a few reviews have been published on the utilization of GO-based materials for the removal of heavy metals. However, no systematic or extensive observation has been done to relate the different surface functional groups that are responsible for functionalization with respect to cationic and anionic heavy metal removal. Also, the contribution of different functional groups on the adsorption of heavy metals remains unclear. Therefore, this review focuses on the surface functional groups that dominate the functionalization of GO and their roles in heavy metal removal. On a similar note, the influence of pH, as well as the functional groups in the adsorptive removal mechanism of heavy metals are highlighted. Additionally, the future outlook of GO-based materials as adsorbents for heavymetal removal is also discussed. This review is much anticipated for an improved research on the efficiency and reliability of GO-functionalized materials in their utilization in water, and wastewater treatment technology, as well as being extensively applied in other related environmental systems."

      "text" : "Some of the most critically concerned cationic heavy metals found in the environment and water body are lead ion (Pb(II)), cadmium ion (Cd(II)) and mercury ion (Hg(II)). These heavy metals commonly exist as divalent cations with an oxidation state of þ2 in the aqueous solution as in Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Hg2þ. The toxicity of heavy metals is significantly contributed by the exposure time of metals, the amount of the metals, and the method of introduction (Jaishankar et al., 2014).\nPb(II) comes from various sources, such as from the smelting of ores, metal plating and battery industries, fertilizers and pesticides, house paint, gasoline additives and plumbing pipes (Jaishankar et al., 2014). An exposure to lead can cause digestive problems, neurological disorders, high blood pressure, reproductive health problems, kidney dysfunction, muscle and joint pain, as well as memory and concentration problems in adults. On top of that, lead can damage the developing brains of infants and young children (Fayiga and Nwoke, 2017). Furthermore, the amount of blood lead level (BLL) of less than 10 mg/dL can lead to greater potential drop in IQs in children, and BLL as low as 40 mg/dL can result in motor nerve dysfunction in adults (Goyer, 1990; Brown and Margolis, 2012).\nCd(II) can be introduced to human through air, soil, water, and food, and its long-term exposure can cause cancer and other organ system toxicity, such as cardiovascular, central and peripheral nervous, urinary, reproductive, skeletal and respiratory systems (Rahimzadeh et al., 2017). The sources of cadmium include oil spills of boats, domestic disposals into water bodies, pesticides and fertilizers, as well as industrial and domestic wastes (Sarong et al., 2015). An amount of 2e3 mg Cd/g creatinine in the urine had previously induced kidney damage in general population of Europe (J€arup, 2003). Furthermore, as stated by Mohammadi et al. (2019), the value for Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) of more than 1 10 4 of the exposure for one heavy metal is considered as highly risky in causing cancer.\nMeanwhile, the Hg(II) intake in humans is mainly from the consumption of estuarine and marine fish, as well as other seafood. Methylmercury exposure can cause neurological disorder, where exposed pregnant mothers can harm the development of the foetus, and in some cases, cause severe cerebral palsy-like\nsymptoms in babies (Driscoll et al., 2013). When the concentration ofmercury in human exceeds 0.1mg/L, the effects on health include damaged nervous system, acrodynia, protoplasm poisoning, and possible spontaneous abortion (Singh and Gupta, 2011). In addition, even shorter exposure time of high concentration of mercury can cause nausea, diarrhea, elevated blood pressure, and lung damage (Jaishankar et al., 2014). Nevertheless, the utilization of mercury is decreasing due to health and environmental concerns. Thus, other substitutes for mercury are preferred to reduce the harmful behaviour of mercury in the ecosystem.\nLong-term exposure of heavy metals can result in the degeneration of neurological, muscular, and physical processes, such as Alzheimer’s disease, muscular dystrophy, and Parkinson’s disease. Meanwhile, repeated longer-term exposure can even lead to cancer (Jaishankar et al., 2014). Due to the high toxicity of these cationic heavy metals, the maximum allowable limit for Pb(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) in the drinking water is set to 0.015 mg/L, 0.005 mg/L, and 0.002 mg/L respectively (USEPA, 2009). Meanwhile, the allowable effluent discharge standard in upstream and downstream of water supply is 0.10 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L for Pb(II), 0.01 mg/L and 0.02 mg/L for Cd(II), and 0.005 mg/L and 0.05 mg/L for Hg(II), as stated in the Effluent Discharge Standard of Environmental Quality Act 1974 Malaysia.\nTherefore, various GO-based nanomaterials, either virgin or modified GO of oxygen-containing, nitrogen-containing, sulphurcontaining, or mixture surface functional groups, have been studied for their adsorption of these cationic heavy metals.\n2.2. Oxygen-containing modified GO for cationic heavy metals\nBetween all modification and functionalization of GO, the most significant surface functional group involved is the oxygencontaining functional groups, such as hydroxyl (-OH), carboxyl (-COOH), epoxy (-COC-), and carbonyl (-C]O). These functional groups serve as the active site for the functionalization of GO to obtain composites together with metals, organic molecules, or other heteroatoms (Morimoto et al., 2016). The existence of these functional groups have always been directly related to the new bonding formation with the adsorbed heavy metals, as confirmed using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) of before and after adsorption (Bian et al., 2015; Pourbeyram, 2016). Fig. 1 shows the wide spectra of XPS on ß-cyclodextrin modified GO from before and after adsorption of Pb(II) ion. New peaks of Pb 4f were detected after the adsorption at 139 and 144 eV, as shown in the inserted curve, which confirmed the existence of the new bonding of PbeO (Zheng et al., 2018).\nTable 1 shows the existing studies that utilizing oxygencontaining functional groups for the functionalization of GO to remove cationic heavy metals. Most of contain typical functional groups found in GO, in addition to the characteristic functional groups of the materials selected for functionalization such as polymers, inorganic materials, and metal oxides. Pourbeyram (2016) reported that a chemically modified GO nanocomposite named graphene oxide-zirconium phosphate, a modified GO, was created through the bonding between the oxygen-containing functional groups at GO, such as hydroxyl groups with zirconium site of zirconium phosphate. For this composite, the oxygencontaining groups, phosphate, acted as the adsorbent, Zr ion acted as the binder, and GO acted as the template for the adsorbent. The results showed that GO-Zr-P has the adsorption capacity of 363.42, 328.56, 232.36, and 251.58 mg/g for Pb(II), Cu(II), Cd(II) and Zn(II) respectively. The adsorption capacity increased with increasing amount of adsorbent dosage; for 150 mg of GO-Zr-P, ~99% of 50 ppm heavy metals were removed within 20 min,\nTable 1 Oxygen-containing GO adsorbents for cationic heavy metals removal.\nAdsorbents Bonding Target heavy metals Maximum adsorption capacity (mg/g) References\nGO e modified zirconium phosphate ZreOH, CeO, Zr-OP Pb/Cu/Cd/Zn 363.42/328.56/232.36/251.58 Pourbeyram (2016) MgAl-layered double hydroxide\nmodified MGO CeC, CeO, CeOeC, OeC]O Pb/Cu/Cd 192.31/23.04/45.05 Huang et al.

(2018a) ß-cyclodextrin decorated GO -OH, eC]O, eCOOH, eC]C, CeO, eCH2- Pb 149.56 Zheng et al. (2018)\nwhile for 50 ppb of heavy metals, ~98% of heavy metals were removed using 50 mg of GO-Zr-P within 30 min. The incorporation of phosphate group into GO has improved the specific surface area thus increasing the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents. At the same time, the presence of oxygen-containing compound, such as hydroxyl and carboxyl that originate from the adsorbents, could easily displace or react with the heavy metal ions, thus increasing the adsorption efficiency (Huang et al., 2018b).\nIn other cases, Yi et al. (2018) had modified the sodium alginate hydrogel which was rich in carboxyl and hydroxyl groups using GO and polyvinyl alcohol as the fillers and dispersing agent, respectively. The blending of both components was thought to provide durability and chemical stability to the hydrogel. Meanwhile, commercial GO was functionalized using FeeMg double (hydr)oxide through the co-precipitation method (Huang et al., 2018a). The presence of oxygen-containing bonding in both GO and FeeMg hydroxide had worked synergistically to remove heavy metals mainly through complexation, and ion exchange through OH ions. The grafting of highly oxygenated functional groups of ß-cyclodextrin onto GO has also successfully solved the issue of GO, in which it has a high tendency to form polymerized layer structures. Thus, the high specific surface area was maintained and the maximum adsorption capacity of Pb(II) was increased to 149.56 mg/g (Zheng et al., 2018). Therefore, the modification of GO using oxygencontaining materials directly increases the presence of oxygencontaining functional groups, which serves as the attachment and complexation site for its interaction with heavy metals.\n2.3. Nitrogen-containing modified GO for cationic heavy metals\nThe functionalization of GO using nitrogen-containing\nfunctional groups is also widely investigated due to the affinity of nitrogen compound for heavy metals. In fact, more studies have reported on the functionalization of GO with nitrogen-containing functional groups compared to oxygen- and sulphur-containing functional groups due to the endless varieties of nitrogencontaining materials. Nitrogen atom has five valence electrons surrounding it and commonly forms three bonds with other atoms, leaving a pair of electrons. This lone pair of electrons serves as the activation site to trigger an interaction between the heavy metal ions. Some nitrogen-containing functional groups modified GO are tabulated in Table 2. The functionalization of GO using nitrogencontaining functional groups was demonstrated by Arshad et al. (2019), in which the polyethylenimine (PEI) modified GO-alginate (fGOCA) hydrogel was synthesized for the adsorption of Pb(II), Hg(II) and Cd(II) from aqueous solution. The structure of polyethyleneimine has abundant amounts of NeH groups, where upon the modification with GO, will allow more active sites for heavy metal adsorption. The results showed that fGOCA has higher heavy metal adsorption capacity of 602, 374, and 181 mg/g for Pb(II), Hg(II), and Cd(II) respectively. The excellent removal may be due to the synergetic effects of abundant functionalities in GO, complexation of polyamine, as well as carboxylate groups of alginate. Besides that, the functionalization of GO using nitrogen-group as studied by Zare-dorabei et al. (2016), was done using a bidentate ligand, 2,20-dipyridylamine to anchor them to the GO surface and increase its affinity in coordinating with most inorganic metal ions. The modification thus, introduced pyridine rings which served as a Lewis base to attract cationic heavy metals for adsorption.\nTo overcome the difficulty of separating hydrophilic GO-based adsorbents from aqueous solution, many researchers have opted to incorporate the magnetic properties, such as iron(II,III) oxide,\nTable 2 Nitrogen-containing GO adsorbents for cationic heavy metals removal.\nAdsorbents Bonding Target heavy metals\nMaximum adsorption capacity (mg/ g) References\nPolyethylenimine (PEI) modified GO-alginate hydrogel\nNeH, CeN, eCOOH Pb/Hg/Cd 602/374/181 Arshad et al.

The superparamagnetic properties of MGO enables it to be attracted to external sources of magnetic fields, thus simplifying the phase separation process. For instance, Peer et al. (2018) affirmed that the second generation of dendrimer was synthesized from magnetic GO-modified with polyamidoamine to remove Cd(II), Pb(II), and Cu(II). Dendrimer is a new class of polymeric material, which has numerous surface functional groups and internal cavities (Xiao et al., 2016). The first generation was grown through amidation using tris(2-aminoethyl) amine, whereas the second generation was further grown using ethylenediamine. The grafting of amino groups to the carbonyl groups on GO had formed amide functional groups, which weakened the structure of GO by producing additional defects on it. Nevertheless, the presence of oxygencontaining and nitrogen-containing groups on the modified MGO had successfully provided an outstanding adsorption capacity for the removal of cationic heavy metals. Moreover, the magnetic properties were able to simplify the separation method for the removal of adsorbents from the treated water. Furthermore, Ma et al. (2017) investigated the removal of Pb(II) by using the polymaleicamide dendrimer of maleic anhydride and ethylenediamine as the functional monomers. A few generations were made and the amino-terminated functional groups provided greater Pb(II) adsorption capacity, with an increase in the generation as compared to carboxyl-terminated functional groups. Gabris et al. (2018) synthesized GO-functionalized cyanopropyl to remove Pb(II). The direct visualization of GO and cyanopropyl MGO from\nFig. 2. SEM images for a) GO b) cyanopro\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is shown in Fig. 2. It could be seen that the GO had folded into a sheet-like structure whereas the functionalized cyanopropyl MGO showed the absence of smooth surfaces indicating the successful assembly of cyanopropyl and magnetic materials on GO. The complexation of Pb(II) with eCNtriple bond was the main contributor for an efficient removal of Pb(II), at a maximum adsorption capacity of 111.11mg/g and pH 5.0.\nMeanwhile, the surface modification of GO with nitrogen was successfully demonstrated by Wang et al. (2018) using N2 plasma for the removal of Co(II). The bonds formed between the adsorbents and Co(II) were investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT). It was concluded that the bondings of GOeCOOHeCo and GOeOHeCo were of shorter distance, thus, providing a stronger surface complexation, as compared to that of the NGO-Co bond. In short, the formation of surface complexes on the surface of adsorbents was mainly attributed by the oxygen-containing functional groups, even in the presence of nitrogen-containing functional groups. Nevertheless, the contribution of nitrogen-containing functional groups was not neglected, although their involvement might not be as significant as the surface oxygen-containing functional groups.\n2.4. Sulphur-containing modified GO for cationic heavy metals\nBesides oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing functional groups, sulphur-containing or thiolated materials are also frequently used in the modification of GO for the enhancement in adsorption capacity. In general, more studies utilizing thiolated\npyl/magnetic GO (Gabris et al., 2018).\nadsorbentsare more focused on the removal of Hg(II) due to the spontaneity and selectivity of the eSH sites (Lagadic et al., 2001; Kazemi et al., 2019). Among all the functional groups involved, eSH demonstrated the strongest bonding with mercury, which could interact dominantly with Hg to form sulphur-containing compounds. This preferential bonding could be explained following the Hard-Soft-Acid-Base (HSAB) theory, where Hg(II) is a soft acid that prefers to bond with soft base, the thiol-groups (Mohammadnia et al., 2019). According to Kumar et al. (2016), the SH bonding prefers to form stable complexes with Hg, Ag, and Au; which are highly polarizable soft metals; and to some lesser extent, with Zn and Cd. Nevertheless, some studies have reported on the high adsorption capacity of sulphur-containing functional groups in adsorbing other heavy metals besides Hg (Hu et al., 2013; Pirveysian and Ghiaci, 2018; Wei et al., 2018).\nTable 3 shows the sulphur-containing GO adsorbents modified for the removal of cationic heavy metals from aqueous solution. Pirveysian and Ghiaci (2018) have successfully sulphurized GO using sodium sulphide to produce sulphur-functionalized GO, and further modified it using mesoporous shell of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and silicon dioxide (SiO2) to obtain sodium sulphide functionalized GO coated with TiO2 and sodium sulphide functionalized GO coated with SiO2. With the introduction of the thiol-containing compound, the exfoliation of GO was thought to occur at the edges. Nevertheless, the sulphurization and coatingwith TiO2 and SiO2 did not disturb the internal structure of GO, thus retaining the unique properties of GO. Mojoudi et al. (2018) prepared activated carbon/ thiol functionalized GO from sugarcane molasses that obtained an adsorption capacity of 204.08 and 196.07 mg/g for Pb(II) and Cd(II), respectively.\nFuthermore, the introduction of the thiol-containing compound has been successfully demonstrated by Xia et al. (2019) using 3- mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane to produce a novel thiolfunctionalized GO/FeeMn. The author reported that, even with the presence of oxygen-containing active sites i.e. eOH, OeC]O, SieO on the surface of adsorbents, eSH showed the strongest bonding capability with Hg through different forms. Similarly, 3- mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane was also used to introduce thiolated compound onto the magnetic GO with the presence of toluene (Mohammadnia et al., 2019). The adsorption of Hg using thiolated magnetic GO showed outstanding performance in which the adsorption capacity was able to reach up to 129.7 mg/g at equilibrium in 60 min and at pH 7.\n2.5. Sulphur- and nitrogen-containing modified GO for cationic heavy metals\nWith fierce development on the functionalization of GO with various materials, the modification does not only focus on a single\nheteroatoms. In fact, a number of researchers have opted to functionalize GOwith a material that has a mixture of heteroatoms in it, such as compounds with both nitrogen- and sulphur-containing functional groups (Yari et al., 2015). Awad et al. (2017) synthesized a novel 2-imino-4-thioburet-partially reduced graphene oxide which has bonding of C]S, CeS, O]CeN, C]N, and CeN besides the typical functional groups that can be found in GO. This adsorbent showed excellent selection in the removal of Hg(II) from the mixture of other heavy metals. Only 3% Zn(II), 4% Ni(II), 9% Cd(II), 21% Cu(II), and 63% Pb(II) were adsorbed, while 100% Hg(II) was adsorbed, indicating that this adsorbent has very high selectivity of Hg(II) ion, even in the presence of other heavy metals. Besides that, Fu and Huang (2018) have reported on the synthesis of magnetic dithiocarbamate (DTC) functionalized reduced GO to remove cationic heavymetals of Cu(II), Cd(II), Pb(II), and Hg(II) ions. As shown in Fig. 3, the incorporation of polyethyleneimine had introduced nitrogen-containing compound, and subsequently, the addition of carbon disulphide had introduced sulphur-containing functional groups to the adsorbents. At a pH level of less than 3, the tendency of DTC to dissociate into amine and carbon disulphide, as well as the competition between Hþ and metal ions to be adsorbed onto the active sites (-N-CS2- anion), lead to poor adsorption. Nevertheless, at optimum pH, the maximum adsorption capacities of the adsorbent were able to achieve up to 113.64, 147.06, 181.2 and 116.28 mg/g for Cu(II), Pb(II), Hg(II), and Cd(II), respectively. Meanwhile, the thiol-functionalized magnetic GO that contained both nitrogen- and sulphur-containing functional groups was synthesized from acetylcysteine, where it managed to\nsuccessfully adsorb Hg(II) at a maximum adsorption capacity of 208.8 mg/g (Kazemi et al., 2019)."

      "heading" : "3.1. Toxicity of anionic heavy metals",
      "text" : "For anionic heavy metals, the two most commonly known metals are chromium (Cr) and arsenic (As). Chromium is most commonly found in the form of trivalent (Cr(III)) and hexavalent (Cr(VI)) oxidation state (Hossini et al., 2016). Cr(III) exists as a cation with þ3 charge, whereas Cr(VI) commonly occurs as oxyanions, such as dichromate (Cr2O72 ), hydrochromate (HCrO4 ), and chromate (CrO42 ) (Shahid et al., 2017). Cr(VI) is known as a potent carcinogen, whereas Cr(III) is considered to be mildly toxic. According to The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 100 mg/L is the maximum allowable limit of total chromium in the drinking water. The increased levels of chromium that contaminate the environment come from the increase in its widely increased application in mining, textile dyeing, chemical manufacturing, metallurgy, and electroplating (Lukina et al., 2016; Awang et al., 2019). Since it is well known that Cr(VI) is more toxic than Cr(III), more studies have been focusing on Cr(VI) removal from aqueous solutions, as compared to Cr(III) using GO derivatives.\nArsenic can be found in the form of oxyanionic heavy metals which are H2AsO4 and HAsO4 . Major sources of arsenic include metal smelters, fungicides and pesticides, and the permissible limit of arsenic on human health is 0.02 mg/L (Singh and Gupta, 2011). The chronic exposure of the human body to arsenic, widely known as a carcinogenic substance, could lead to skin cancer, lung cancer, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chromosomal disease, diabetes, peripheral vascular disorder, and Blackfoot disease (Zahra et al., 2017). As previously reported, drinking 1 L/day of water with 50 mg/L and 8.3e51 mg/L concentration of As and Cr, respectively, throughout one’s lifetime can cause bladder, liver, lung, or kidney cancer (Alidadi et al., 2019). The chemical composition of arsenic plays an important role in determining its toxicity. The toxicity of arsenic follows the sequence of organic As < As(V) < As(III) (Danil et al., 2012). In terms of 50% lethal concentration (LC50), which is the concentration of substances that causes the deaths of 50% of a targeted population, an LC50 value of 30 mg/L As(III) can cause death in Nile tilapia. Meanwhile, the fish can tolerate an LC50 concentration of As(V) that is 7-fold higher in the second day as compared to As(III), which confirms the greater toxicity of As(III) compared to As(V) (Ferreira et al., 2019). Thus, more studies have been focusing on the removal of As(III) and As(V) from water bodies due to their acute toxicity compared to that of organic As.\n3.2. Oxygen-containing modified GO for anionic heavy metals\nThe oxygen-containing GO adsorbents for the removal of anionic heavy metals are shown in Table 4. Generally, the oxygen-\ncontaining functional groups can be protonated at a lower pH solution and to become the active sites for the adsorption of negatively charged Cr ions (Ali, 2018). In other words, at a lower pH, the adsorption of oxyanionic heavy metals of Cr and As ions dominantly occurs through the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged heavy metal ions and positively charged adsorbent. For instance, Chen et al. (2015) modified carboxylic acid GO with akaganeite (ß-FeOOH) to remove both arsenic and arsenate from aqueous solution. The oxygen from the FeeO bonding served as the attraction site for As ions for complexation. Thus, the adsorption efficiency of both As ions was able to increase, up to 100% in the range of pH 4 to 11. Liu et al. (2015), on the other hand, demonstrated the functionalization of GO using two metal oxides, which were manganese dioxide and iron oxide. Manganese dioxide acted as a crucial adsorption site, whereas iron oxide served as a magnetic material to ease the separation of adsorbents and water. Furthermore, the formation of GO encapsulated in alginate beads is also one of the options for modification to overcome the difficulty in GO separation from treated water. For instance, Vu et al. (2017) modified GO with magnetite and encapsulated it with alginate beads for stability and aggregation prevention. The removal of As(V) and Cr(VI) showed good performance and the roles of crosslinking was emphasized.\nThe functionalization of reduced GO using montmorillonite was reported by Zhang et al. (2015). Although the functionalization was thought to introduce more oxygen-containing groups, the adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) was moderate, only up to 12.86 mg/g. Meanwhile, Zhang et al. (2018a) have reported on the reduced GO modified with nickel oxide for the adsorption of Cr(VI). Since NiO nanoparticles are not stable at acidic condition, therefore, Ni was dissociated as Ni2þ and reacted with HCrO4 to form NiCrO4 deposits. Shahrin et al. (2018) affirmed the modification of GO using manganese ferrite was effective for the removal of As(V). The synthesized hybrid nanomaterials resulted in an increase in surface area and greater amount of oxygenated-containing functional groups, which turned out to provide more active sites for As(V) adsorption and stabilized dispersion of materials. The functionalization of GO with amorphous iron oxide was also successfully prepared using iron sulphates without the presence of N2 gas condition (Su et al., 2017). The pore volume and surface area increased with iron oxide content, which created more mesopores and therefore, enhancing the adsorption of As ions.\n3.3. Nitrogen-containing modified GO for anionic heavy metals\nThe modification of GO using nitrogen-containing materials for anionic heavy metals is tabulated in Table 5. The introduction of nitrogen-containing functional groups on GO could be done by modifying GOwith polypyrrole (Setshedi et al., 2015). At a lower pH solution (pH < 6.2), simultaneous protonation of nitrogen atom of polypyrrole and dissociation of doped Cl will allow for the adsorption of HCrO4 ions, thus increasing the adsorption capacity. Other than that, 3-(2-amino ethyl amino) propyl trimethoxysilane\nTable 5 Nitrogen-containing GO adsorbents for anionic heavy metals removal.\nAdsorbents Bonding Target heavy metals Maximum adsorption capacity (mg/g) References\nPolypyrrole intercalated into GO CeN Cr (VI) 625 Setshedi et al.

The adsorbent showed outstanding ability to adsorb Cr(VI); however, the volume of AAPTS needed to be in an optimum range. This is to avoid the reduction of surface area, resulted from the blockage of mesoporous sites due to dehydration-condensation reaction. Similarly, the modification of GO using polyethyleneimine provided an introduction of a number of eNH2 on the GO surface. It was then protonated to eNH3þ at an acidic pH, thus preferring to adsorb the negatively charged Cr(VI), which could be in the form of HCrO4 , CrO4 , HCr2O72 , or Cr2O72 (Wang et al., 2017). However, at solutions with higher pH, nitrogen atoms in the adsorbents were deprotonated, causing a competitive interaction between hydroxyl ions and CrO42 ions for adsorption. The electron pair of nitrogen from amine acted as an active site for the chelation for Cr(III) ions into adsorbent complexes. Furthermore, amine and hydrogen bondings in polyethyleneiminemodified GO successfully stabilized the adsorbents and prevented GO aggregation (Geng et al., 2019). As shown in Fig. 4, the involvement of nitrogen-containing bonds for oxyanionic Cr ions could possibly be attributed by the electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding. Besides that, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) also contributed to the adsorption of Cr ion using electron-donor\nFig. 4. Proposed Cr(VI) adsorption mechanism on poly\ngroups (He et al., 2017). Meanwhile, for the adsorption of As(V), the nitrogen-containing triethylenetetramine was reported for the cross-linking on GO together with the presence of hydroxyethyl cellulose (Jin et al., 2018). Even in the presence of nitrogen-containing compound, it was highlighted that the adsorption of anionic species of H2AsO4 and HAsO42 could be adsorbed onto the positively charged surface of the oxygen-containing adsorbents (GO-OH2þ and GOCOOH2þ). On the other hand, Zhang et al. (2019) have successfully prepared the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate modifiedmagnetic GO for the adsorption of As(III) and As(V). The presence of ionic liquid increased the electrostatic attraction between the positively-charged imidazolium ring on the adsorbent and oxyanionic As ions. Consequently, the adsorption of As ions was enhanced.\nAnother functionalization of nitrogen-containing functional groups onto GO for As ions was demonstrated using chitosan by Kumar and Jiang (2016). At an acidic pH, the protonated eOH, eCOOH groups originated from GO, and eNH2 group from chitosan served as adsorption sites for oxyanionic As species thus increasing the relative adsorption capacity, as compared to that of the nonfunctionalized GO. Therefore, it could be concluded that for the\nethyleneimine cross-linked GO (Geng et al., 2019).\nremoval of oxyanionic Cr and As ions, both nitrogen- and oxygencontaining compounds play significant roles as the site of interaction. The nitrogen-related bonds hadinteracte with oxyanionic species similar to how the oxygen-related bonds do, thus, both functional groups were able to increase the adsorption performance.\n3.4. Sulphur-containing modified GO for anionic heavy metals\nRelative to oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing functionalized GO, fewer researches have reported on the modification of GO using sulphur-containing compounds for the adsorptive removal of anionic heavy metals. This might probably be attributed by the lower affinity of anionic heavy metals when using sulphurcontaining compound for GO modification due to the hard base nature of certain sulphuric anions and soft acid nature of Cr6þ, Cr3þ, and As3þ. Table 6 portrays the sulphur-containing functionalized GO for the removal of anionic heavy metals. The modification of GO by the introduction of sulphur-containing materials was demonstrated by Prabhu et al. (2019) by using calcium lanthanum sulphide (CLS) to remove both As(V) and As(III). Arsenate preferred to be adsorbed onto the CLS through its reaction with calcium and lanthanum, while arsenite was thought to react with sulphur by following the Pearson’s hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) theory. Ca2þ and La3þ are hard acids, and they tend to form complexes with arsenate, which is a hard base. On the other hand, S2 is a soft acid, and tends to form a complex with arsenite, which is a soft base. In an article by Han et al. (2017), it was reported that the photocatalytic degradation of Cr(VI) by using tin(IV) sulphide graphene oxide under visible light radiation has successfully removed 100% of Cr(VI) with an initial concentration of 20, 50, 100, and 150 mg/L, and 86% of 200 mg/L Cr(VI) within 90 min. Meanwhile, sulphur-containing functional groups could also be extracted from sulphur-rich biomass of Ulva fasciata and reacted with ferric chloride to produce ferrous sulphide anchored graphene. The adsorbent did not only successfully adsorb Cr(VI) but also the Pb(II) ion and different types of dyes, such as congo red, crystal violet, methyl orange, and methylene blue (Mahto et al., 2018).\nInvestigations utilizing oxygen-containing and nitrogencontaining materials for the functionalization of GO in removing cationic and anionic heavy metals were significantly abundant compared to that of sulphur-containing materials. Only the adsorption of Hg ion was very popular with sulphur-containing materials due to their soft-acid-soft-base interaction. Most studies were focused on nitrogen-containing materials due to the abundant availabilities of certain nitrogen-containing materials, variety of choices, and greater adsorption affinity of heavy metals. In addition, the functionalization of GO with nitrogen-containing functional groups also provided more surface interactions along with the significant contribution of oxygen-containing functional groups besides that of the nitrogen-containing groups."

      "text" : "For an enhanced adsorption performance of the synthesized adsorbents, the mechanism of the heavy metal removal is being\ncommonly explored (Huong et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2019). The heteroatoms functional groups play a crucial role in determining the mechanism for the adsorptive removal of heavy metals. It is noteworthy to know that the mechanism usually does not involve only one route, although it consists of direct and indirect influences of different pathways. For example, the combination between sulphur-containing groups, such as sulphonyl and sulphonate, together with oxygen-functional groups, such as epoxide, ketone, hydroxyl and carboxyl, which provided the driving force for the adsorption of heavy metals by forming hydrogen bond as well as electrostatic attraction with the cationic heavy metals (Pirveysian and Ghiaci, 2018)."

      "heading" : "4.1. Adsorption isotherms and kinetics",
      "text" : "One way of exploring the possible routes or mechanisms involved in the adsorption process is through the study of adsorption isotherms and kinetics. In general, the adsorption isotherm relates to the adsorption amount of adsorbate with the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate in bulk solution (Xing et al., 2015). Themost frequent isotherms used to evaluate the adsorption equilibrium data are Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms, as demonstrated by previous studies (Ge and Ma, 2015; Xing et al., 2015; Shahzad et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2018a; White et al., 2018). Eqs. (1) and (2) express the linear equation of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms respectively:\nCe qe ¼ Ce qm þ 1 KLqm\n(1)\nlogqe ¼ logKF þ 1 n logCe (2)\nwhere Ce (mg/L) is the final concentration of heavy metals ion after equilibrium, qe (mg/g) is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents at equilibrium, qm (mg/g) is the maximum adsorption capacity, KL (L/mg) is the Langmuir constant related to the heat of sorption, KF is the Freundlich constant associated to sorption capacity, and n is a Freundlich constant related to the adsorption intensity. Table 7 shows the results of adsorption isotherm of modified GOs used for various adsorption processes of heavy metals. From Table 7, it can be seen that the correlation coefficient (R2) for Langmuir was very often relatively higher as compared to that for Freundlich. Therefore, this suggested that the adsorption of heavy metals on various modified GO had occurred uniformly and following the monolayer adsorption instead of multilayer adsorption. In addition, the Langmuir isotherm also describes that adsorption occurs at equivalent adsorption energies and homogenous binding sites with no interactions between the adsorbates (Zhao et al., 2016). On the other hand, Freundlich isotherm is an empirical model that describes the heterogeneous surfaces (Zanin et al., 2017). From the equation, when the value of 1/n in the Freundlichmodel is less than 1, then the adsorption process is favourable (Park et al., 2016).\nIn general, the adsorption process involves four steps. The first step is an external mass transfer (heavy metal ions from bulk solution to the surrounding layer of adsorbent). The second step is the external diffusion to the external surface, while the third step is the\ninternal diffusion of the adsorbate to the internal adsorption site. The final process is the adsorption, which occurs on the surface of the adsorbents (Largitte and Pasquier, 2016; Nyairo et al., 2017). The different assumption of rate-determining step derive a different kinetic model. The kinetics of heavy metal adsorption on adsorbents are mostly studied using pseudo-first order and pseudosecond order kinetic models (Li et al., 2015; Lingamdinne et al., 2016; Park et al., 2019).\nThe pseudo-first order kinetic model suggests that the adsorption occurs through physisorption, in which the sorption occurs only through weak Van der Waals forces only and without any chemical bonding occurrence. The adsorption is also easily reversible, which makes it easier for this type of adsorption to be regenerated. The pseudo-second order claims that there are two reactions that occur either simultaneously or one after another. The first reaction is fast, thus, it reaches equilibrium rapidly. Meanwhile, the second reaction transpires slowly and takes a longer time to reach equilibrium (Wang et al., 2015). Pseudo-second order indicates that the adsorption occurs through chemisorption. It is deduced that the bonding occurs due to electronic sharing and the transfer between adsorbents and adsorbate is relatively stronger, as compared to the physisorption pathway from pseudo-first order kinetic. To support the evidences for newly occurred chemical bonding, analysis from X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is usually considered (Manirethan et al., 2018). The presence of new peak related to uranium can be found in the XPS spectra after adsorption, which proves that an interaction involving new chemical bonding has occurred (Song et al., 2019). Apart from the aforementioned kinetic models, intraparticle diffusion kinetic model has also been performed by some researchers (Ge and Ma, 2015; Nyairo et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2018a). Intraparticle diffusion, which is studied through the Weber-Morris model, assumes that the intraparticle diffusion is the only rate-determining step, since the mass transfer of adsorbate is considered a rapid process (Mohan et al., 2017). Eqs. (3)e(5) express the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models respectively:\nlogðqe qtÞ¼ logqe K12:303 t (3)\nt qt ¼ 1 K2qe2 þ t qe\n(4)\nqt ¼K3t 1 =2 þ C (5)\nwhere, qt (mgg 1) is the adsorption capacity at respected time, t, C (mgg 1) is the intraparticle diffusion constant, K1 (1/min), K2 (gmg 1min 1), and K3 (mgg 1min 1/2) are the rate constants of pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and intraparticle diffusion models respectively. From Table 8, it can be concluded that most of the heavy metal adsorption on GO-functionalized adsorbents had fitted well with the pseudo-second order kinetic model, judging from the correlation coefficients. For instance, Fig. 5 illustrates the graphs of adsorption kinetic models for graphene oxide modified with triethylenetetramine and chitosan (TGOCS). The three different kinetic models are pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, and intraparticle diffusion models. Out of all the three, the experimental data had fitted better with the pseudo-second order model (R2 ¼ 0.9996), as compared with the pseudo-first order (R2¼ 0.9522) and intraparticle diffusion model (R2 ¼ 0.8796). Thus, the adsorption of Cr(VI) on the surface of TGOCS was mostly due to chemisorption. Besides TGOCS, most of the adsorption of heavy metals on other GO-functionalized adsorbents were also through chemisorption, as frequently depicted from the kinetic models. A few other studies have also reported on adsorption obtained through physisorption (Zhou et al., 2015; Moharram et al., 2016). Although physisorption was expected to be easily reversible, thus simplifying the regeneration process, an adsorption that follows a pseudo-second order kinetic model (chemisorption) could also be relatively and easily regenerated in practical terms."

      "heading" : "4.2. Influence of pH on the mechanism",
      "text" : "The effects of pH on the adsorption of heavy metals are commonly associated with the points of zero charge (pHpzc) of the adsorbents as well as the initial pH of the solution. pHpzc is the pH at which there is no net charges on the surface of the particles. In other words, the amount of positive and negative charges on the surface of adsorbents are the same, which results in a neutral surface. This neutral surface will have no electrostatic interaction with any ions. In order for cationic heavy metals to be adsorbed on the surface of adsorbents at a wider pH range, the pHpzc of the adsorbents should be more acidic relative to the pHpzc for the adsorption of anionic.\nHeavy metals. When the pH of the solution is higher than the pHpzc, the surface of the adsorbents becomes negatively charged. Hence, this attracts cationic heavy metals to be adsorbed on the\nadsorbents, following the electrostatic attraction. On the other hand, when the pH of the solution is lower than the pHpzc, the surface of the adsorbents becomes positively charged, making it useful for the adsorption of anionic heavy metals. Hadadian et al. (2018) synthesized the novel zinc oxide-graphene (ZnO-Gr) nanocomposite which has a pHpzc of 3.26 for Ni(II) removal. It was concluded that at a pH of less than 3.26 (pHpzc), there was no adsorption of Ni(II) on the ZnO-Gr surface due to electrostatic repulsion between the positive-positive charges of Ni(II) and positive surface of the adsorbent. Meanwhile, at a pH between 3.26 and 5.6, the adsorption of Ni(II) was very low, as there was a competition between Ni(II) and Hþ ions to be adsorbed. Nevertheless, the Hþ ions would win due to their larger charge density. Only at a pH greater than 5.6 to 8.2 can the removal of Ni(II) increased and reached optimum pH for adsorption. At a pH more than 8.2, even if the negatively charged surface sites are abundant, Ni(II) no longer exists as Ni2þ, but as Ni(OH)þ, Ni(OH)2, Ni(OH)3-, or Ni(OH)42 species. Therefore, it is suggested that the electrostatic attraction had poor performance, causing the adsorption rate to decrease.\nTable 9 shows the mechanisms involved in the removal of heavy metals using modified GO as the adsorbents. Generally, the adsorption of heavy metals on GO mainly involves the electrostatic\nattraction between the opposite charges and surface complexation. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the mechanism of heavy metal removal mainly involved surface complexation and electrostatic attraction. For instance, Cui et al. (2015) modified the magnetic GO with a hexadentate ligand, EDTA to treat Hg(II), Pb(II) and Cu(II) and concluded that there were two mechanisms involved in heavy metal adsorption. The first one was the electrostatic interaction between the heavy metal ions (Mþ) and oxygenic functional groups, such as hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups on GO. Besides that, since EDTA is a chelating agent that performs coordination complexation, additional coordination interaction had occurred between Mþ and EDTA. Both mechanisms were primarily affected by the pH of the solution, in which, at a more acidic pH, more Hþ ions were available. This, in turn, caused a preferred protonation of adsorbents. Therefore, the abundance of positive charges caused repulsions for the interaction of Mþ with the adsorbents. On the contrary, the deprotonation occurred at a higher pH, which increased the amount of negative charges.

Furthermore, at a higher pH, precipitation usually takes place, instead of adsorption. Note that these effects of pH could be applied only for cationic heavy metals, whereas for anionic heavy metals, the pH effects would be vice versa.\nFor As(III), at a pH of less than 9.2, the heavy metal exists as neutral molecules in H3AsO3; therefore, there is no electrostatic interaction involved in the removal mechanism (Sherlala et al., 2018a). On the other hand, the coordination interaction between As(III) and adsorbent occurred in the form of surface complexation, forming the bonds between As(III) and COOH and OH from the modified chitosan-GO, as obtained by Kumar and Jiang (2016), via the utilization of chitosan-functionalized GO for As removal. On the contrary, As(V) naturally exists as oxyanions (H2AsO4 , HAsO42 , and AsO43 ) at a pH greater than 2.2 (Yoon et al., 2017). Therefore, for the removal mechanism of As(V), the electrostatic interaction at different pH values plays a significant role. The influence of different pH could be related back to the pHpzc of the adsorbents as stated earlier. In an acidic environment, the abundant amounts of Hþ ions in the solution promotes the protonation of eOH and\neCOOH groups to become cationic eOH2þ and eCOOH2þ groups. The presence of these cations contributes to the optimum adsorption preferences for anionic As(V). therefore, the optimum pH for As(V) removal is more likely to be at an acidic condition, such as at pH 2 (Huong et al., 2018)."

      "text" : "Furthermore, the functional groups present on the surface of the adsorbents also play a crucial role at times. The increase in oxygencontaining functional groups promotes the adsorption of heavy metals (Guo et al., 2016). For instance, the increase in the composition of GO in hydrogel can improve the adsorption capacity of Pb(II) ions, as demonstrated by Yu et al. (2019), which fabricates the sodium alginate hydrogel modified with polyvinyl alcohol and graphene oxide. Higher content of GO causes an increase in the amount of carboxyl groups, creating a strong complexation between Pb(II) and carboxyl ions on the surface of the hydrogel. Fang et al. (2017) studied the contribution of oxygen-containing groups on the GO monolith and concluded that the abundance of oxygencontaining groups did not ensure the maximum adsorption capacity of heavy metals. In fact, only the dissociative oxygenated groups on GO surface play a dominant role, as compared to nonbasic or non-acidic oxygenated groups, such as C]O and CeOeC, which had less significance on the adsorption role since they were less reactive."

      "heading" : "5. Feasibility of GO-based adsorbents for actual wastewater treatment system",
      "text" : "The study on the utilization of GO-based adsorbents in adsorbing heavy metals is still in the developing stage, where the investigation mainly focuses on the laboratory-scale and through the use of synthetic wastewater as the adsorbate. Nevertheless, some investigations have been done on the batch study performance of GO-based adsorbents in removing heavy metals using actual wastewater, such as from pharmaceutical effluents (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2015), municipal sewage effluents (Li et al., 2014), leather industry wastewater (Samuel et al., 2018) and fine chemical wastewater (Dong et al., 2018). Gopalakrishnan et al.\n(2015) suggested that the adsorption of heavy metals using GO from the pharmaceutical effluents could completely remove Pb(II) and Cr(VI), but traces of Ni(II) was left when 70 mg of GO was used in 100mL of effluent. On the other hand, the treatment efficiency of Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II) and total organic carbon (TOC) in the municipal sewage effluents using 2 g/L GO adsorbents reached 85.6%, 73.2%, 68.9%, 90.1%, 72.4%, and 83.2% respectively which demonstrated the feasibility of GO adsorbents in real wastewater application. Meanwhile, Samuel et al. (2018) have reported on the adsorption of Pb(II) from leather industry wastewater in Tamil Nadu by using chitosan-modified MGO. Due to the small amount of Pb(II) ions in actual wastewater, Pb(NO3)2 was added until the concentration of Pb(II) reached 50 mg/L. The result showed an 80% adsorption of Pb(II) from the actual wastewater, in which the experiment was deemed successful.\nApart from that, studies on the interference of GO-based nanomaterials with other pollutants found in actual wastewater, such as bacteria, nutrients, and organic pollutants, are crucial in order to assess the feasibility of GO application in actual wastewater treatment system. As reported by Li et al. (2014), the presence of organic matter, such as humic acid or fulvic acid, at a low pH provided positive influence on the adsorption of Cu(II) from aqueous solution. On the contrary, at a high pH, the adsorption of Cu(II) was negatively affected. Meanwhile, Ahmed and Rodrigues (2013) investigated the effects of GO (in the form of solution) on the activated sludge sample of secondary wastewater treatment. The presence of GO in these microbial community caused deterioration in the bacterial viability, metabolic activity, and biological treatment of nutrients, as well as reducing the final effluent quality by increasing the turbidity and reducing the dewaterability. Therefore, by considering the negative impacts of GO during the secondary stage of conventional wastewater treatment and the presence of organic matter, the adsorption of heavy metals using GO adsorbent can be performed at tertiary/advanced wastewater treatment process in order to reduce the interference from other pollutants. Other than that, the modification of GO using materials with good affinity in removing heavymetals, nutrients, and organic pollutants, simultaneously, can be investigated to ensure the feasibility of GO-based adsorbents in the wastewater treatment system."

      "heading" : "6. Conclusions and future outlook",
      "text" : "The past few years have seen drastic increment in the publications of synthesis and applications of functionalized GO. A number of oxygen-containing, nitrogen-containing, and sulphur-containing functional groups modified GO have been reported. Generally, most of them have an outstanding adsorption capacity for the removal of cationic and anionic heavy metals. Although nitrogen-containing compounds and sulphur-containing compounds have their own roles in the adsorption properties, the oxygen-containing compounds still play a significant role in the interaction of removing heavy metals, where in certain cases, the influence of nitrogenbond and sulphur-bond had not been highlighted. Nevertheless, the synergistic effects between the nitrogen-containing and sulphur-containing materials, along with oxygen-containing compounds, have always had a positive collaboration. Nitrogencontaining functional groups materials are the most popular choice, which might be due to their abundant availability from a variety of sources. For the removal of cationic heavy metals, most of the oxygen-containing, nitrogen-containing, and sulphurcontaining GO compounds are suitable as adsorbents. Meanwhile, for the removal of anionic heavy metals, oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing GO-based compounds are more suitable. However, more attempts could be addressed on the feasibility of\nsulphur-containing GO compounds for anionic heavy metals by taking into account the possible active bond interaction formed. The pHpzc of the materials should be measured in order to identify the optimum pH condition with respect to the target heavy metals. GO-based compound with pHpzc that is slightly acidic is a suitable choice. This is because, in an acidic environment, anionic heavy metals can be adsorbed, and at neutral to slightly basic environment, the adsorption of cationic heavy metals can occur. The adsorption of heavy metals is also directly influenced by the solubility of the species in the solution.\nSome of the critical drawbacks of GO have been frequently addressed, such as the difficulty in separating GO-based materials from treated water. This is done by either incorporating magnetic properties into the GO adsorbents as beads, hydrogels or aerogels, or further utilizing GO-based materials as a membrane or column filtrate. Nevertheless, current researches are mostly focused on the mode of synthesis and adsorption studies using batch test. Only a few papers have extended their researches on column or continuous studies. Therefore, the extension studies of modified GO adsorbents in a longer time frame and bigger scale should be investigated to explore the real potential and challenges of GObased adsorbents. Furthermore, the performance of adsorbents in removing the trace amount of heavymetals should also be explored to assess the performance of the adsorbents at a very small concentration of heavy metals. On top of that, studies on the ability of adsorbents to remove heavy metals from real wastewater are still scarce, as most studies have only utilized synthetic wastewater. Since there are many other contaminants, such as organic pollutants, nutrients, and bacteria, in the real wastewater, the side effects on the performance of adsorbents may prove to be significant and they should be addressed. Further exploration on the preparation of GO by using other starting materials besides graphite should be explored, especially on those that can provide a greener solution."
