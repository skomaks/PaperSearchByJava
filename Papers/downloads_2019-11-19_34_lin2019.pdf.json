      "text" : "Hydrogen is one of the most promising energy candidates with slight ecological impact [1]. Producing hydrogen by water electrolysis is a desired way [2,3]. But both of the two half-reactions (hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction, HER and OER) are kinetically sluggish and need electrocatalysts to reduce the additional energy expenditure [4,5]. Many studies were focusing on replacing the high cost HER or OER noble metal catalysts (Pt, RuO2 and IrO2) [6,7]. However, most of the reported catalysts performed well only for one half reaction, or effective in one kind of electrolyte condition. Previous studies have suggested that non-noble metal Ni has a moderate hydrogen binding energy similar to that of Pt and might be a promising candidate for catalyzing both HER and OER [8–10]. However, Ni metal is unstable under acid conditions due to dissolution. Alternatively, some transition metal phosphides were found to possess electronic structure similar to [NiFe] hydrogenase, thus are promising catalysts for HER process [6], despite\nthe introduction of more electronegative nonmetallic P degraded the conductivity. Recent researches revealed bimetallic phosphide nanostructures displayed superior electrocatalytic performance for both HER and OER compared to their single metallic counterparts, owing to the enhanced proton discharge efficiency and synergistic effect [11–15].\nTo achieve both high activity and stability comparable to those of Pt, rational design and controlled synthesis of hybrid nanostructures with desired interface and structure are essential [16–19]. Herein, we first synthesized multi-dimensional Ni/NiCoP nano-heterojunctions (NHs) by a solid-state phase transformation (SPT) strategy. In the special structure, metallic Ni nanoparticles (NPs) are enclosed and strung by NiCoP, forming strings of Ni/NiCoP core/shell nanostructures. This particular structure takes the most of advantages of Ni metal and bimetallic phosphides nanostructures, but avoids the disadvantages. More significantly, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and synchrotronradiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies show that the Ni/NiCoP interface brings unique electronic structure.

All of these peculiarities contribute to the positive discovery: a comparable HER activity to commercial Pt/C especially in alkaline, better OER activity than IrO2.

      "text" : "HER and OER tests were performed in a three-electrode system with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai): a Ag/AgCl as reference electrode, a graphite rod as counter electrode and the catalyst modified Ti slice (thickness: 0.1 mm, area: 1x1 cm2) as the work electrode. The 0.5M H2SO4 electrolyte and 1M KOH electrolyte were bubbling with N2 or O2 for about 20min to saturate, respectively. All the potentials were calibrated to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and the polarization curves were iR corrected. The work electrode was prepared as follows: 10 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 1mL hexanes and ultrasonic at least 30min to form a homogeneous slurry. Then 200 μL slurry was dropped on the Ti slice with a 20 μL increment, the final catalyst mass loading is 2 mg∙cm−2. The decorated Ti foils were dried under ambient conditions and annealed under 5% H2/Ar [20–22].\nLinear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were performed with a scan rate of 5mV·s−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements scanning at non-Faradaic potential regions with different scan rates were used to determine the double layer capacitance (Cdl). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments with frequencies ranging from 105 Hz to 0.1 Hz were carried out with an alternating current (AC) amplitude of 5mV at the given potentials. The gaseous product was measured by a gas chromatography (Bruker GC450), and the Faradaic efficiencies were calculated with the reported method [23]."

      "text" : "Fig. 1a displays the synthetic process of multi-dimensional Ni/ NiCoP NHs using SPT strategy. Firstly, CoP NCs (Fig. S1, Fig. S2) were synthesized through an organic solution method with Co(acac)2 as metal source and trioctylphosphine (TOP) as P source in oleamine (OAm), the resulting NCs were separated and re-dispersed in 1-octadecene (ODE). The critical step for generating multi-dimensional Ni/ NiCoP NHs is the addition of the second metal precursor (Ni(acac)2) into CoP NCs dispersion followed by heating at 320 °C for 2 h. In this process, metallic Ni NCs formed first and then promoted further growth of NiCoP, forming strings of Ni/NiCoP core/shell structures. Powder Xray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. S1a) confirms the two-phase existence of NiCoP and Ni. Interestingly, segregated NiCoP NCs (Fig. S1˜S5) can also be prepared by adding extra TOP in the second step. Ni2P and Ni NCs (Fig. S1, S2) were also synthesized for electrocatalytic performance comparison. A series of samples with different Ni:Co mole ratios were also synthesized, and the characterizations (Fig. S6, S7) suggested the optimal feed mole ratio for synthesizing this multi-dimensional core/ shell Ni/NiCoP heterojunctions is Co(acac)2: Ni(acac)2 = 1:1 (Ni/ NiCoP NHs).\nHigh-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) shows that Ni/NiCoP NHs possess snap beanlike morphology (Fig. 1b). This special morphology conform to the\nideology of “1+0″, which mean the composite material is multidimensional with one-dimensional (1D) NiCoP nanorod and zero-dimensional (0D) Ni nanoparticles. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) suggested that all the clear diffraction rings match well with Ni and NiCoP (Fig. 1c). High resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Fig. 1d, 1e, 1f, 1 h) and spherical aberration correction (AC) (AC-HAADF-STEM) (Fig. 1j) show identifiable fringe spacing of 0.22 and 0.20 nm, which are corresponding to (111) crystal plane of NiCoP and (101) crystal plane of Ni. These crystal plane identification can be confirmed accurately by line profile (inset of Fig. 1f and 1 h) and FFT images (Fig. 1g, 1i, 1k, 1 l). Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images (Fig. 1m, 1n) further confirm the existence of N, Co and P elements, while Ni mainly exists in the core part of the Ni/NiCoP heterojunctions. EDS line scanning (Fig. 1o, 1p, 1q) was used to further prove the multi-dimensional core/shell Ni/NiCoP heterojunctions. Three different regions in one Ni/NiCoP heterojunctions were selected: entire heterojunctions (insert of Fig. 1o), nanoparticles part (insert of\nFig. 1p), nanochains part (insert of Fig. 1q). The corresponding EDS elements line scanning curves confirm Ni mainly exsites in the core part of the nanoparticles, while the outer of the nanoparticles and the nanochain parts are consist of Ni, Co, P with a uniform distribution. All the above analyses prove Ni nanoparticles are enclosed and strung by NiCoP, forming multi-dimensional core/shell Ni/NiCoP nano-heterojunctions.\nXPS was measured to reflect surface element chemical states. Obvious peaks of Ni, Co and P elements could be observed in the survey of samples (Fig. S8). Six distinct peaks belong to Ni-P (Ni 2p3/2 852.7 and Ni 2p1/2 870.1 eV), oxidized Ni species (855.7 and 873.5 eV) and satellites (861.5 and 879.4 eV) could be divided in Ni 2p spectra of Ni/ NiCoP NHs, NiCoP NCs and Ni2P NCs (Fig. 2a). Similarly, Co-P (Co 2p3/ 2 778.1 and Co 2p1/2 793.3 eV), oxidized Co species (781.4 and 797.1 eV) and satellites (785.5 and 802.5 eV) also can be assigned in Co 2p spectra of Ni/NiCoP NHs (Fig. 2b). In P 2p region (Fig. 2c), the peak around 129.6 eV belongs to P bonds to Ni and Co, and the peak at\n133.3 eV attributes to oxidized P species due to exposure to air. Interestingly, the binding energy in Co 2p spectra for Co-P bond in Ni/NiCoP NHs and NiCoP NCs locate at more negative positions (˜ 0.4 eV) compared with that for CoP NCs, but higher than that of metal Co (778.1 eV). And the negative shift (˜ 0.2 eV) also could be observed in P 2p spectra, suggesting the different electronic structures among Ni2P, CoP, NiCoP, NCs and Ni/NiCoP NHs, but both the Ni and Co show positive charges and P shows negative charge. All these charge property make its structure similar to that of hydrogenase, benefiting the electrocatalytic HER activity [24–26].\nSynchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were further carried out to demonstrate the electronic structure and coordination information. The Ni K-edge absorption threshold position (Fig. 2d) locates between the contrastive NiCoP, Ni2P and NiO, indicating the valence of Ni follows the order of Ni(NiO)>Ni(Ni/ NiCoP)>Ni(NiCoP)>Ni(Ni2P)>Ni. These results reveal the formation of heterojunction greatly changes electronic structure of Ni(0). Similarly, Co K-edge absorption threshold position (Fig. 2f) suggests the valence of Co follows the order of Co(Co3O4)>Co(CoO)>Co (CoP)>Co(Ni/NiCoP)>Ni(NiCoP)>Co. These results confirm XPS analyses, suggesting the different electronic structures of Ni and Co in Ni/NiCoP NHs which may be more conducive to electrocatalytic reaction than NiCoP, Ni2P and CoP NCs. The coordination information of Ni (Fig. 2e) and Co (Fig. 2g) atoms can be confirmed by Fourier-\ntransformed (FT) k3-weighted EXAFS spectra. Compared with R-space of Ni foil, NiO, Ni2P, Co foil, CoO, Co3O4, CoP and NiCoP, the peaks of Ni R-space at 1.7 and 2.25 Å, Co R-space at 1.6 and 2.3 Å can be observed in Ni/NiCoP NHs, which can be attributed to Ni-P, Ni-Co(Ni), Co-P and Co-Ni shells. Additionally, the intensity of Ni-Co(Ni) in Ni/ NiCoP NHs is higher than that of NiCoP NCs, indicating the higher Ni coordination in Ni/NiCoP NHs. The structural parameters of Ni and Co atoms can be obtained by quantitative EXAFS fitting (Fig. S9 and Table S1). Moreover, wavelet transform (WT) contour plots (Fig. 2h) of Ni/ NiCoP NHs show two intensity maximum at about 6 and 10 Å which also can be attributed to Co-P, Co-Ni, Ni-P, and Ni-Co(Ni) coordination by comparing with the WT plots of Co foil, Co3O4, Ni foil, and NiO.\nWe employed a three-electrode setup to assess HER and OER performances. The samples were dropped on Ti slice and annealed under 5% H2/Ar to remove surfactant before measurement and the effect of this treatment on the activity was clarified (Fig. S10, S11). The HER and OER electrocatalytic performance of the samples with different Ni:Co feed ratios were first measured (Fig. S12 ˜ S15), and the electrochemical tests suggested Ni/NiCoP NHs (feed mole ratio is 1:1) was optimal for both HER and OER. Therefore, Ni/NiCoP NHs was selected as the target electrocatalyst. Polarization curves and Tafel curves in 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. 3a, Fig. S16a) suggest except commercial 20% Pt/C, Ni/NiCoP NHs catalyst delivers a smaller overpotential (125mV) at the current density of 10mA·cm−2 and lower Tafel slope (70mV·dec-1) than that of NiCoP (145mV, 75mV·dec-1), Ni2P (160mV, 85mV·dec-1), Ni (250mV)\nand CoP (470mV, 112mV·dec-1), indicating the excellent HER electrocatalytic activity and kinetics [27,28]. Significantly, Ni/NiCoP NHs shows small HER overpotential of 90 and 168mV at 10 and 50mA·cm−2 and low Tafel slope (95mV·dec-1) in 1M KOH (Fig. 3b, Fig. S16b), comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (65 and 157mV, 67mV·dec-1), and lower than that of NiCoP (157 and 230mV, 99mV·dec-1), Ni2P (367 and 459mV, 104mV·dec-1), Ni (215 and 288mV, 108mV·dec-1) and CoP (197 and 284mV, 110mV·dec-1). Tafel slope value of Ni/NiCoP NHs also suggest that the HER reaction follows Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism in both acid and alkaline [29]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. S17, Table S2) suggests the smallest charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of Ni/NiCoP NHs, verifying a quick electron transfer rate [30]. Besides, Ni/NiCoP NHs also show biggest electrochemical double-layer capacitances (Cdl) value (Fig. S18 ˜ S19) for both HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1M KOH, suggesting the largest electrochemical active surface area (ECSA).\nThe OER electrocatalytic performance was investigated in 1M KOH. Ni/NiCoP NHs catalyst show higher current density at the same overpotential than IrO2, NiCoP, CoP, Ni2P and Ni (Fig. 3c). Only 260mV vs. RHE is needed to reach the current density of 20mA·cm−2. And the Tafel slope (Fig. S16c) of Ni/NiCoP NHs is 80mV·dec-1, indicating the favorable reaction kinetics. Ni/NiCoP NHs catalyst was tested for 1000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles in acidic/alkaline medium for HER and OER, and in neither case did the activity show a noticeable change in\npolarization curves (Fig. 3d). Chronoamperometry curves (Fig. 3e) display a negligible loss at the initial time (≤ 5 h) due to the slight drop of active Ni/NiCoP, then the current densities keep unchanged for at least 43 h. The HER and OER electrocatalytic activity of Ni/NiCoP NHs shows significantly improvement compared to some reported highly active electrocatalysts (Fig. 3f, Table S3-S5).\nTEM images of Ni/NiCoP NHs after CV cycled stability tests on HER and OER (Fig. S20) suggested the post-test Ni/NiCoP NHs almost retained the initial morphology. EDS elemental mapping images of Ni/ NiCoP NHs after HER stability tests in both acid (Fig. S21) and alkaline (Fig. S22) confirmed the co-existence of Ni, Co, P. Moreover, the corresponding EDS spectra suggested Ni remained to be the main component, demonstrating the outer NiCoP indeed protected Ni cores from corrosion even in acid. High resolution Ni 2p, Co 2p and P 2p spectra (Fig. S23) suggested the chemical states of the post-HER catalyst in both acid and alkaline did not change, but the chemical states of the postOER catalyst showed an obvious difference, signals belonged to phosphides disappeared, only broad peaks corresponding to the oxidized Ni, Co species were observed for the post-OER sample, and P element was in the similar situation, relating with the surface oxidation during the OER process. EDS line scanning of Ni/NiCoP NHs after stability tests for OER (Fig. S24) was carried to further study the element distribution, and the results showed that the outer part of the heterojunctions was oxygen richer than the inner part, conforming the surface oxidation\nduring the OER process, and surface oxides (or hydroxides) were active species for OER as reported by previous studies [31].\nBased on the above analyses, the Ni/NiCoP NHs catalyst was regard as an efficient HER and OER (pre)electrocatalyst in alkane solution. Therefore, we expect Ni/NiCoP NHs electrodes can act as an excellent bifunctional catalyst for water splitting in alkaline [29] (Fig. 3g). Polarization curve (Fig. 3h) of two electrode (Ni/NiCoP ǁ Ni/NiCoP)\nsuggested that cell voltage of Ni/NiCoP couple at 10mA∙cm−2 was 1.57 V, lower than that of NiCoP ǁ NiCoP (1.61 V), Ni ǁ Ni (1.71 V), Ni2P ǁ Ni2P (2.03 V), CoP ǁ CoP (1.81 V) and Pt/C ǁ IrO2 (1.58 V). To reach the current density of 50mA·cm-2, only 1.71 V was needed, which is better than or parallel to most previously reported highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts (Table S6). Durability test with multi-current density (Fig. 3i) demonstrated the activity could be maintained at least\nof 19 h. The amount of gaseous products from theoretically calculation and experimentally measurement for HER and OER in half-reactions using Ni/NiCoP NHs in alkaline are shown in Fig. 4a, and the data of overall water splitting using Ni/NiCoP NHs as both anode and cathode are shown in Fig. 4b. From which we can see the theoretically calculated gas amount matches well with the experimentally measured values, suggesting that the all of the Faradic efficiencies are nearly 100%. We also tested the Faradic efficiencies in the early stage (after 1 h) and latter stages (after 48 h) of overall water splitting using Ni/NiCoP NHs as both anode and cathode as shown in Fig. 4c and Fig. 4d, the results suggest the Faradic efficiencies are nearly 100% after both 1 h and 48 h reaction, proving the excellent stability of our materials for overall water splitting.\nDFT calculations of H* adsorption free energies (ΔGH*, * denotes an adsorption site) and density of states (DOS) were carried out to further understand the excellent electrocatalytic performance of Ni/NiCoP NHs. An ideal |ΔGH*| is close to zero which indicated moderate H adsorption strength, further suggesting the compromised reaction barriers of the adsorption and desorption steps in hydrogen production process [32,33]. Bimetallic NiCoP (ΔGH* = -0.42 eV) shows more favorable H* adsorption strength than that of Ni2P (ΔGH* = -0.51 eV) (Fig. S25a). Moreover, the obviously increased charge density of DOS around Fermi level for NiCoP suggests more charge carriers are provided (Fig. S25b). For Ni/NiCoP NHs, ΔGH* values at three interface sites were calculated (Fig. 5a, the corresponding optimized model representations for hydrogen adsorption are shown in Fig. S26), and the results show that bridge Ni site far from the surface has a more negative ΔGH* (Fig. 5b). The negative ΔGH* reveals the rate limiting step for HER process on NiCoP is the strong binding of H adatom, but the binding strength decreases as the distance between the HER site and the Ni/NiCoP interface decreases. To understand how interface emerging changes the electronic structure of NiCoP, DOS was also calculated (Fig. S27). According to the d-band theory [34], the strong binding strength of H adatom decreases as the d-band center of the surface downshifted from the Fermi level (Fig. 5c). In alkaline, water dissociation (Volmer step, H2O+ e− = Hads + OH−) is usually the rate-determining step due to the high barrier. Thus the adsorption energy of H2O molecule was further calculated. DFT calculation suggests the adsorption energy of H2O on Ni/NiCoP interface (-0.72 eV) is much more favorable than that nearby Ni or NiCoP (Fig. 5d), demonstrating the formation of Ni/NiCoP hetero-interface accelerates alkaline HER by optimizing the Volmer step.\nFor alkaline OER, the transition metal phosphides actually act as pre-catalyst, because the surficial oxidation occurs under the actual OER potential and is responsible for OER, so the surficial oxidation process can be calculated by DFT to reflect the OER activity. In alkaline, the hydroxyls firstly react with the substrate to form OH*. The adsorption energy of OH* is calculated to be -3.39 eV, indicating the hydroxyl can be strongly captured by the interface sites. The charge density difference plot further indicates the interface sites can donate electron to OH* for generating high valence Ni/Co species (Fig. S28), which may be the real active sites for OER [35–37]."

Herein, we report synthesis of snap bean-like multi-dimensional core/shell Ni/NiCoP nano-heterojunctions (NHs) by adopting a solid phase transformation strategy. In the special structure, Ni nanoparticles are enclosed and strung by single phased NiCoP, forming strings of Ni/NiCoP core/shell heterojunctions, which showed improved stability and activity for both hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that interactions at the interface of Ni/NiCoP greatly changed electronic structures, which is a key intrinsic factor to underpin the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate Ni/NiCoP interface provide more optimal binding strength for H adatom and H2O molecule for HER, strong capture of hydroxyl, high valence Ni/Co species for OER. All these peculiarities facilitate the electrocatalytic process: only 1.57 V was needed to reach the current density of 10 mA·cm for the overall water splitting using Ni/NiCoP NHs as both electrodes. This work demonstrates a facile strategy for synthesis of sophisticated catalytic interface at nano level and endows nano-heterojunction catalysts with enhanced performance for catalytic applications.",
