      "text" : "Thermal transport across interfaces of material and their surrounding medium\nplays an important role in the performance and stability of devices ranging from\nelectrothermal heating element (EHHE), microelectronics to transistor [1]. Managing\nthermal transport in these devices lies in the regulation of interface thermal\nconductance (ITC). For example, EHHE has attracted tremendous attention during the\npast decades because of their wide application in industry, such as thermal therapy,\nsoil remediation and anti-icing of aero surfaces [2-4] as well as household, such as\niron and toaster [5, 6]. The EHHE is formed by resistant heater embedded in dielectric\nceramic material. Thus, large ITC between heater and surrounded dielectric material\nwill lead to high heating efficiency of EHHE. What is more, local superheating of\nheater induced by interface will also be eliminated with high ITC, and lead to long\nservice life of heater.\nGenerally, the heater of EHHE is made from Cr-Ni alloys, which are one of the\nmost studied binary alloy systems and form the basis for many types of austenitic and\nmartensitic steels [7]. The Cr0.22Ni0.78 (corresponding to 20 wt.% Cr and 80 wt.% Ni) is one of the most widely used Cr-Ni alloys. The dielectric material of EHHE is made\nfrom MgO or -Al2O3 (Sapphire), which has high thermal conductivity, melting point\nand low electric conductivity [8]. Therefore, improving the ITC between Cr0.22Ni0.78 and MgO (or Al2O3) is essential and necessary.\nDifferent strategies have been put forward to enhance the ITC. One line is\nengineering the geometry of the two materials forming the interface, which includes\ndecreasing interfacial roughness [9-11] and increasing surface roughness [12]. The\nother line is introducing interlayer at the interface [13-16], which has the advantage of\nslightly affecting properties of the two materials. The most commonly adopted\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc ep te d M an us cr ip t\n4 / 21\ninterlayer is self-assembled monolayer, which will strengthen interfacial bonding [15-\n18] or decrease the mismatch of vibration modes [14, 19]. However, as organic\nmaterials, the melting point of self-assembled monolayer is quite low which limits its\napplication in high temperatures. Enhancing the industrial-relevant properties of\ndevices, such as efficiency, service lifetime and operating temperature, is the keen\ninterest of researcher.\nIn this paper, the ITCs of Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 interfaces are\ninvestigated through non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. An\nexcellent candidate, Cu nano-interlayer, is introduced to effectively enhance the ITCs\nof both Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 interfaces. To better clarify the effect of Cu nano-interlayer, a comparison with graphene interlayer is performed. The\ndependence of enhanced ratio on both temperature and thickness of Cu nano-\ninterlayer is studied. Finally, the phonon transmission function and vibrational\nspectrum analysis are performed to reveal the underlying physical mechanism."

      "text" : "The system of molecular simulation is shown in Fig. 1. Here, the ITC along the\n[001] direction is studied. Crystal structures of Ni, Cu and MgO are face-centered\ncubic system, and the lattice constants are 3.643 Å, 3.615 Å and 4.190 Å, respectively.\nCrystal structure of Al2O3 is trigonal system, a hexagonal unit cell containing 6 formula units is in common use. Its parameters are aH=4.759 Å, cH=12.991 Å. Due to the difference in lattice constants, lattice mismatch of cross section will occur when\nforming interfaces. This will induce stress and strain and decrease the adhesion\nenergy, thus high frequency phonons can be scattered and result in the decreasing of\nITC [20]. In order to decrease the effect of lattice mismatch, a paring of two materials\nwith the smallest value of cross section mismatch is needed.

Meanwhile, the interlayer Cu\n9n×9n unit cell can be introduced to better fit the cross section of the system.\nConsidering the computationally cost, the value of n is taken as 1. Lattice mismatches\nare 2.2% and 1.1% for Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 interfaces, respectively. The sizes of the Cr0.22Ni0.78, MgO, Al2O3 and Cu are 32.787 Å ×32.787 Å ×51.002 Å, 33.52 Å ×33.52 Å ×50.28 Å, 33.313 Å ×32.971 Å ×51.964 Å and 32.535 Å ×32.535\nÅ, respectively. For Cr0.22Ni0.78, a single crystal with Ni element is first generated. Then, 22% Cr as substitution atoms are randomly distributed. Interfacial distances are\ninitially set due to the parameters of Van der Waals interaction.\nTable 1 Parameters for LJ potential for different elements\nMg Al O Cr Ni C Cu\nmeV 4.816 21.909 2.603 12.438 12.438 4.555 167.0\nÅ 2.691 4.008 3.118 2.893 2.893 3.431 2.314\nThe EAM potentials proposed by Bonny et al. [21, 22] and Foiles et al. [23] are\nused to model the interatomic interactions within Cr0.22Ni0.78 and Cu, respectively. The Buckingham potential is used to model the short-ranged interatomic interactions\nand the long-ranged interatomic interactions are described by the Coulomb\nelectrostatic forces for MgO [24] and Al2O3 [25]. For MgO, the ions are assigned partial charges of qMg=1.7, qO=-1.7 [24]. For Al2O3, the ions are assigned partial charges of qAl=1.4175, qO=-0.945 [25]. The optimized Tersoff potential is used to model C-C interactions within graphene [26, 27]. The interfacial van der Waals\ninteractions are modeled by the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential through the Lorentz-\nBerthelot mixing rules [28].

For Cr0.22Ni0.78,\ngraphene and Cu, the cutoff distances are 5.18 Å, 2.1 Å and 4.95 Å, respectively. As\nthere are Coulomb electrostatic forces for MgO and Al2O3, the cutoff distances are set as 8 Å and 10 Å, respectively for both Coulomb electrostatic forces and Buckingham\npotential. Coulomb electrostatic forces outside the cutoff distance are computed in\nreciprocal space with the PPPM method.\nFig.1 (a) Schematic picture of the simulation system. The fixed and periodic boundary conditions are applied along the longitudinal and transverse directions, respectively. (b) A typical temperature profile of the interface system with interlayer. The interface temperature difference (ΔT) is defined as the difference between the linearly extrapolated temperature at each side of the interface.\nNEMD simulations throughout this paper are performed using the LAMMPS\npackage [32-34]. The periodic boundary condition is applied along the transverse\ndirection. In order to establish a temperature gradient along the z direction, the system\nis coupled with Langevin thermostats [35-37] at the 3rd to 6th and (N-6) th to (N-3) th\nlayers with temperature of T0(1+Δ) and T0(1-Δ), respectively.

The equations of\nmotions are integrated by the velocity Verlet method with a time step of 1 fs.\nInitially, to remove the internal stress induced by lattice mismatch, the system is\nrelaxed in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble (NPT) at target temperature (T0) and 0 bar for 2 ns with periodic boundary conditions applied to all three directions. Then, the\nperiodic boundary condition in the z direction is replaced by the fixed boundary\ncondition through introducing vacuum space at the left and right ends to avoid\ninteractions among atoms from the two ends. At the same time, atoms at the 1st to 2nd\nlayers and the (N-2) th to N th layers are fixed by setting the velocity and force as zero\nduring the following evolutionary process. The system is relaxed under the\nmicrocanonical ensemble (NVE) for 3 ns. After that, a time average of temperature\nand heat current is performed for 8 ns. The results presented here are averaged over\nsix independent simulations with different initial conditions."

The Cu nano-interlayer can be deposited through magnetron sputtering with\nnanoscale precision on experiment [38]. Here, the thickness of Cu nano-interlayer is\n7.2 Å. For Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO (or Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/Al2O3) interface, there are two ITCs (ITCs of Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu and Cu/MgO interfaces) and thermal conductance of Cu. We define a single ITC (shown in Fig. 1(b)) which consists of all the three part. So\nthe single ITC is an effective value, which treats the interface as a black box and\nmeasures the ability that phonons transport from one side to the other side no matter\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc ep te d M an us cr ip t\n8 / 21\nhow “thick” or “thin” the Cu nano-interlayer is. This definition is widely adopted in\nprevious studies [11, 19].\nFig.2 The interface thermal conductance of Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO (red dot), Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO (black dot), Cr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 (blue dot) and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/Al2O3 (light yellow dot) interfaces versus the temperature.\nThe results show that the ITCs of all systems increase with temperature increases.\nA similar temperature dependence of ITC is also found by NEMD simulation [31, 39]\nand experiment [40]. The behind physical mechanism will be clarified in details later\nand shown in Fig. 6. What is more importantly, the ITCs of Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 interfaces are 0.028 GW/m 2-K and 0.059 GW/m2-K at 300 K. Compared with other solid-solid interfaces [1], these are quite low. However, the\nITCs of Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO (red dot) and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/Al2O3 (yellow dot) interfaces are much larger than that of Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO (black dot) and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 (blue dot) interfaces in the whole temperature range, respectively. This means that Cu nano-interlayer can enhance the ITC.\nTo show the effect of Cu nano-interlayer clearly, the ratio of ITC with Cu nano-\ninterlayer to that without Cu nano-interlayer is shown in Fig 3. For Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO interface, the ITC is enhanced about 3 times after introducing Cu nano-interlayer\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc pt ed M an us cr ip t\n9 / 21\n(black dot). For Cr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 interface, the ITC is enhanced about 2.4 times after introducing Cu nano-interlayer (red dot). What is more, the enhanced ratios of both\nCr0.22Ni0.78/MgO and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 systems show weak dependence on temperature. This suggests that the enhancement of ITC by Cu nano-interlayer is\nrobust, and this strategy can be applied to situations in a wide temperature range. To\nshow the effect of Cu nano-interlayer clearly, the results of Cu nano-interlayer are\ncompared with that of graphene interlayer, because graphene has an unltra-high\nthermal conductivity. Also shown in Fig. 3, after introducing graphene interlayer, the\nITC is only enhanced about 1.2 times for Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO interface, and decreased to 0.6 of that for Cr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 interface. This further emphasizes the importance of using Cu nano-interlayer to enhance the ITC.\nFig.3 Ratio of interface thermal conductance of Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO to Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO (black dot), Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/Al2O3 to Cr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 (red dot), Cr0.22Ni0.78/Graphene/MgO to Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO (blue dot) and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Graphene/Al2O3 to Cr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 (pink dot) versus the temperature.\nSince the Cu nano-interlayer can effectively enhance the ITCs of\nCr0.22Ni0.78/MgO and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 interfaces, it is necessary to make it clear how the thickness of Cu nano-interlayer affects this benefits.

When the thickness of Cu nano-interlayer increases\nfrom 1.8 Å to 7.2 Å, the ITCs of Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/ Al2O3 interfaces both increase from 0.062 GW/m2-K to 0.087 GW/m2-K and 0.085 GW/m2K to 0.14 GW/m2-K, respectively. Then, the ITCs of both systems saturate as the\nthickness of Cu nano-interlayer further increases from 7.2 Å to 36.2 Å. This means\nthat the Cu nano-interlayer, with a thickness larger than 7.2 Å, can effectively\nenhance the ITCs of Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 interfaces.\nFig.4 The interface thermal conductance as a function of the Cu nano-interlayer thickness for Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO (black dot) and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/Al2O3 (red dot) interfaces at 300 K.\nThe dependence of ITC on the thickness of Cu nano-interlayer can be understand\nfrom how the phonons transport across the interface. When the thickness of Cu nano-\ninterlayer is small, atoms in Cr0.22Ni0.78 can interact with that in MgO (or Al2O3). As a result, phonons with long wavelength can transport from Cr0.22Ni0.78 to MgO (or Al2O3) directly, without seeing the effect of Cu nano-interlayer. When the thickness of Cu nano-interlayer becomes larger, more phonons should first interact with those in\nCu, and then transport to MgO (or Al2O3). Thus, the effect of Cu nano-interlayer becomes stronger. Finally, when the thickness of Cu nano-interlayer becomes large\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc pt ed M an us cr ip t\n11 / 21\nenough, all phonons should first transport to Cu nano-interlayer, and then to MgO (or\nAl2O3). Then, the ITC saturates.\nFurthermore, the ITC of Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO (GCr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO) and\nCr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/Al2O3 (GCr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/Al2O3) will decrease when the thickness of Cu nano-interlayer becomes large enough. We take Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO as an example. The GCr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO consists of the ITC of Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu (GCr0.22Ni0.78/Cu), Cu/MgO (GCu/MgO) and thermal conductivity of Cu nano-interlayer (Cu). Due to the\nsuperposition of thermal resistance [1], GCr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO can be written as: GCr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO =GCr0.22Ni0.78/Cu+CuS/L+GCu/MgO. Here, S and L are the cross section area and thickness of Cu nano-interlayer, respectively. When the thickness of Cu\nnano-interlayer further increases, the change of GCr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO lies in the change of Cu and L. Due to the anomalous heat diffusion [41], the relationship of Cu and L can be written as Cu ~L. For ballistic diffusion, when L is less than the phonon mean\nfree path of Cu equals to 1 [41, 42]. CuS/L keeps the same, and the\nGCr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO does not change. When L is comparable or large than the phonon mean free path of Cu,  will be less than 1 [41, 42], and GCr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO decreases\nwith L increases.\nTo clarify the underlying physical mechanism and explicitly show how the Cu\nnano-interlayer facilitates phonon transport, we calculate the spectral phonon\ntransmission function [43-46] for different systems. By tracking the force-velocity\ncorrelations between atoms, the transmission function from material A to B can be\ncalculated as:\n \n\n    AisB BA ωω tTMk\n)()(Re 2\nii vF ˆˆ)( (1)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc ep te d M an us cr ip t\n12 / 21\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the interface temperature difference, M is\nthe number of samples, st is the sampling interval, )(i ωv̂ is the Fourier transformed\natomic velocity of atom i, )(i ωF̂ is the total force of atom i exerted by atoms from side B. The thorough derivation of this expression is given by Sääskilahti et al. in [43,\n46]. Herein, to avoid repeated description of similar results, only the transmission\nfunctions of Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO are presented. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), the spectral transmission function of Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO (blue line) is much larger than that of Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO (red line) in almost the whole frequency range. However, as shown in Fig. 5 (b), the spectral transmission function of\nCr0.22Ni0.78/Graphene/MgO (green line) is only obviously larger than that of Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO from 2.7 THz to 5.5 THz and 6.1 THz to 7.1 THz, but smaller than that of Cr0.0.22Ni0.0.78/MgO from 7.5 THz to 9.6 THz. These can be served as evidences that Cu nano-interlayer hugely enhances the ITC of Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO, but graphene interlayer not.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc ep te d M an us cr ip t\n13 / 21\nFig.5 The frequency-dependent phonon transmission function of Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO (red line), Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO (blue line) and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Graphene/MgO (green line) interfaces by tracking the force-velocity correlations between atoms. The inset shows the normalized phonon density of state of bulk Cr0.22Ni0.78 (dark yellow line) Cu (green line) and MgO (wine line).\nWhat is more importantly, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5 (a), the cutoff\nfrequency of phonons for bulk Cu and Cr0.22Ni0.78 are 7.8 THz and 11 THz, respectively, which are quite lower than that of MgO (27.5 THz). Phonon transport\nacross interfaces can through elastic scattering and inelastic scattering. Generally,\nelastic scattering is considered to be dominant in interfacial phonon transport [1, 47].\nPhonons from one material with frequencies larger than the cutoff frequency of the\nother material will be heavily blocked. The inelastic scattering contributes a small\nproportion to ITC. Precisely quantifying phonon elastic and inelastic scattering at\ninterfaces is complex [47]. However, phonons with frequencies larger than the\nsmallest cutoff frequencies of materials that form the interface are sure to transport\nthrough inelastic scattering (high-order phonon scattering) [10].\nDue to the Landauer formula, the ITC can be calculated as\n       d Tω,f A G BA )(T )( 2 1 (2)\nwhere A is the cross section area, ω is phonon frequency, f is the Bose-Einstein\ndistribution function, T is temperature, ħ is the reduced Planck’s constant, and  is\nthe phonon transmission function. By integrating for phonons above 11 THz through\nEq. (2), it is found that phonons with frequency larger than 11 THz contributes 29%\nto the ITC of Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO interface. That is, inelastic scattering only contributes about 29% to the ITC. As a result, phonon transport is mainly governed by elastic\nprocess. However, phonons with frequency larger than 7.8 THz contribute 63% to the\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc ep te d M an us c\nip t\n14 / 21\nITC of Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO interface. That is, inelastic scattering contributes as high as 63% to the ITC. This indicates that inelastic scattering is the dominant process after\nintroducing the Cu nano-interlayer.\nAs the cutoff frequency of Cu is lower than that of Cr0.22Ni0.78, the introducing of\nCu nano-interlayer will not increase the overlap of vibration modes of the system\n(shown in the inset of Fig.5). To quantify this point, the overlap ratio is defined due to\nprevious research [19]. The overlap ratio is 0.045, 0.026 and 0.130 for\nCr0.22Ni0.78/MgO Cu/MgO and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu interfaces, respectively. Obviously, the overlap ratio decreases after introducing Cu nano-interlayer. As a result, the\ninterfacial two phonon process (elastic scattering) will decrease. This also implies that\nthe Cu nano-interlayer will decrease phonon elastic scattering. Besides, the increase\nof transmission function in low frequencies is due to the increase of bonding, which\nenables more phonons to take part in interfacial thermal transport [16, 48].\nFig. 6 (a) The frequency-dependent phonon transmission function of Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO interface at 300 K (red line) and 800 K (dark yellow line). (b) The frequency-dependent phonon\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\n60 A\ncc\nep te d M a\nus cr\nip t\n15 / 21\ntransmission function of Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO interface at 300 K (blue line) and 800 K (pink line).\nThe dependence of ITC on temperature can also be clarified from phonon\ntransmission function. As shown in Fig. 6, at 800 K, the transmission function for\nboth Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO (the thickness of Cu nano-interlayer is 7.2 Å) interfaces are larger than that at 300 K in almost the whole frequency range.\nThis increase in transmission function is in accordance to the enhancement of ITC\nwhen temperature increases. Previous work [31, 39] suggested that the most likely\nexplanation for the temperature dependence of ITC may due to inelastic scattering.\nHowever, no direct evidence demonstrates this point [31, 39]. As shown in Fig. 6,\nhigh frequency phonons experience obvious increases in transmission function for\nboth Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO interfaces when temperature increases. This implies the importance of inelastic scattering. Further calculation based on Eq. (2)\nreveals that the inelastic scattering for Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO (phonon frequency larger than 11 THz) and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO (phonon frequency larger than 7.8 THz) interfaces contributes 55% and 72% to the increase of ITC when temperature increases from 300\nK to 800 K, respectively. That is, inelastic scattering is mainly responsible for the\nincrease of ITC when temperature increases.\nIt also need to be noticed that electron can contribute to thermal transport for\nmetal-dielectric interface. There are two channels: (1) electron-phonon coupling\nwithin the metal, and subsequent coupling between phonons of the metal and phonons\nof the dielectric; (2) direct coupling between electrons of the metal and phonons of the\ndielectric [49]. The electron-phonon coupling in the first channel has been\ndemonstrated to induce negligible influence on the ITC [49, 50]. The second channel\nis important for metals with strong electron-phonon coupling [49, 51]. However, the\nconclusion is based on the assumption that the electron-phonon coupling coefficient\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc ep t d M an u rip t\n16 / 21\nkeeps the same at the interface with that in the metal [49, 51]. Here, the interaction at\nthe interface is vdWs force, which is much weaker than the chemical bonding in metal.\nThus, the confining potential scattering electrons is heavily increased [51], the\nelectron-phonon coupling hugely weakens. Quantifying the exact contribution by the\nsecond channel lies in the electron-phonon coupling coefficient for vdWs interaction,\nwhich is unknown."

      "text" : "In summary, the interface thermal conductance (ITC) of Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO and\nCr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 interfaces are studied by using the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that, after introducing Cu nano-interlayer, the ITC of\nCr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO (Al2O3) interface is hugely enhanced by 3 (2.4) times compared with that at bare Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO (Al2O3) interface. The enhanced ratio shows weak dependence on temperature, and first increases then saturates when the thickness of\nCu nano-interlayer is larger than 7.2 Å. After the phonon density of states and\ntransmission function analyzing, it is concluded that the enhancement of ITC after\nintroducing Cu nano-interlayer is mainly attributed to the facilitating of inelastic\nphonon scattering. For Cr0.22Ni0.78/MgO interface, the inelastic scattering contributes about 29% to the ITC. While for Cr0.22Ni0.78/Cu/MgO interface, the inelastic scattering contributes about 63% to the ITC. This work provides an effective strategy\nto enhance ITC at a wide temperature range and accentuates the importance of\ninelastic phonon scattering at interfaces.\nAs a final remark, we need to emphasize that enhancing the ITCs of\nCr0.22Ni0.78/MgO and Cr0.22Ni0.78/Al2O3 interfaces is an alternative way.
