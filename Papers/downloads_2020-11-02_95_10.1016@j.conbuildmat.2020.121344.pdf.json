      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Reactive Powder Concrete (RPC) is considered to be one of the innovated types of high strength concrete in the construction industry that is developed in the 90’s [1,2]. RPC shows an advanced and powerful behavior compared to that of the Ordinary concrete. RPC is characterized by its excellent mechanical properties and superior durability [3,4]. It attained its outstanding properties through the presence of silica fume (SF) as a pozzolanic material, high cement content, quartz powder, quartz sand, superplasticizers and low water to cement ratio [2,5–7]. Additionally, the exclusion of coarse aggregate will obviously enhance the homogeneity of the RPC matrix and will contribute in omitting the interfacial zone.\nDespite the popularity of RPC and being widely known nowadays, its production is still limited in many countries in the Middle East specially Egypt due to the lack of existence for many of its constituent materials, in addition to the high prices and the unsustainable used materials [8,9]. High cement content is one of the most essential aspects that should be taken into account in developing RPC mix [2,10]. Around seven percent of the global CO2 emissions obtained from the industry of Portland cement [11,12] which results in considering cement unsustainable industry [13]. Pozzolanic materials are being commonly used all over the world as partial replacement of cement for sustainability concern [9]. More than that, the use of certain types of pozzolanic materials in concrete assists in the getting rid of high percentages of the attained waste pozzolans [14]. Furthermore, pozzolanic materials as silica fume, fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag [15,16] and metakaoline [17] enhance the filling effect in addition to the pozzolanic reaction that contribute in the formation of farther calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) [18].\neactive\nSilica fume (SF) is considered an essential constituent in the production of RPC due to its high amorphous silica content that will improve the pozzolanic reaction to a great extent [1,19,20]. In many countries including Egypt, the production of SF is not available easily and may costs a lot; therefore it was necessary to seek for available and cheap alternatives. Kaolinite calcined clays such as Metakaoline (MK) can be used as supplementary cementing materials and hence added to concrete mix as partially replacement of cement [21–29]. Kaolinite clay is abundant and quite available in Egypt. The inclusion of MK to concrete will improve the particle packing of the matrix due to its fine particles, in addition to improving permeability, chemical resistance and the mechanical properties through its high pozzolanic reaction [25,27,30,31]. Many studies revealed that MK will promote the fresh and hardened performance of the concrete matrix than SF will do [22,32]. On the contrary, it was recorded that SF shows better cementing performance than MK. Other researches execute combinations of both MK and SF in ordinary concrete [33–35]. These combinations have shown significant improvement in both workability and mechanical performance of the ordinary reinforced concrete.\nPrevious studies stated that in order to achieve ultra high performance concrete as RPC, its crucial to place mineral admixtures to the concrete mix. Nano materials are considered the most powerful and effectual mineral admixtures nowadays [36]. Several types of nano materials can be incorporated to concrete mix that help in boosting the mechanical behavior [37–46]. Some of the common nano materials that may attain good reputation and hence considered promising nanomaterials are Nanosilica (NS) [47] and Nano metaclay (NC)[48–51]. Many earlier studies have proved that the inclusion of nano materials particularly NS to concrete results in a significant enhancement in durability performance which is attributing to the particle packing and the nucleation effect [48,49,52–55]. It was found that NC is abundant in Egypt so it can be used in concrete design.\nOnly few studies are carried out to study the effect of partially or fully replacement of SF with MK on the mechanical behavior and durability of RPC. Also, up till now the inclusion of NC in MK based RPC has not been studied. To overcome and bridge this research gap, an experimental program is designed to study the expediency of replacing SF with MK in RPC in order to optimize the production cost of RPC in Egypt and to study the impact of using NC and NS in the development of RPC. The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectroscopy and Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry test (MIP) are used to confirm the variation in the microstructure of the designed mixes and hydration products in all different curing conditions."

In addition, SEM test was also performed to observe the microstructure of the RPC mixtures.\nThe mixing and pouring process was executed through the following steps: Mixing of all the dry ingredients for about1 min. After that the addition of water mixed with the superplastizers dosage was took place. The entire mix was subjected to mixing for around 4 min with raising the speed of mixer until the appropriate consistency was achieved. After pouring the RPC in the moulds, a vibrating table was used to assure well compaction of the RPC mixture.\nThe control mix was cured using three curing regimes; water, steam and autoclave. The other mixes were cured only by steaming and autoclaving conditions.\nThe water cured specimen was subjected to 20 C water till testing day, while steaming was at 90 C for 24 h then continuing the curing in normal water at 20 C till the testing day. Autoclaving mechanism was applied by subjecting specimens to a pressure of 20 bar for 4 h then continuing the curing in normal water at 20 C till the testing day."

So the influence of partially replacing the silica fume by 50% and totally replacing by 100% with MK were tested as shown in table 3. NC and NS were used in order to study the RPC behavior when the nano particles were as the same source of the pozzolanic material. So, to study the impact of using nano particles of the same pozzolanic source in RPC, NC is then added to both RPC based silica fume and RPC based MK as a partial replacement for cement admixtures with 3% and 5%. Similarly, NS was used by adding NS particles to both RPC based SF and RPC based MK as a partial replacement for cement admixtures with 2.5%. Nanosilica was added in the replacement ratio of 2.5%; the most effective ratio as taken from literature [59]."

Compressive strength of MK-RPC under autoclave curing.\nof cured specimens compared with the same age are shown in Fig. 1. From the above figure it was concluded that steam and autoclave curing have shown significant improvement on early and late ages strength. Therefore, thermal curing treatment enhanced the compressive strength in RPC more than standard water curing treatment due to the inclusion of high ratios of pozzolans in which these pozzolanic materials have high pozzolanic reaction when subjected to thermal curing and hence results in high percentage of hydrated products under heat treatment. Besides that, autoclave cured mixes reached their maximum strength at 28 days. This might be due to autoclaving that led the pozzolans to complete all their reactions at 28 days. This was also clearly shown in the water and steam cured mixes that showed less strength gain at the age of 28 days due to the incorporated pozzolans that did not complete all their pozzolanic reactions at that age. The low strength gain in early age (7 days) in steam cured can be accounted for the formation of products of a vulnerable physical structures (more porous) that stay empty at the age of 7 days [63]. Additionally, subjecting both the steamed and the autoclaved specimens to standard water curing till 28 days will lead to continuous hydration development and hence boost the hydration of remaining unhydrated cementitious particles that would achieve extra hydration products which enhanced pore structure [64]."

      "heading" : "3.1.2. Effect of using MK in RPC",
      "text" : "Figs. 2 and 3 show the effect of partially and totally replacing SF by MK in RPC under steam and autoclave curing respectively. Also, the percentages gain of compressive strength of cured specimens compared with the same age are shown in Figs. 2 and 3.\nFrom the above results, the same conclusion that was achieved in SF mixes, could be observed in all the MK mixes, where the MK autoclave cured mixes reached a significant high strength at 28 days. This might be due to autoclaving that led the pozzolans\nto complete all their reactions at 28 days as mentioned before. This was also apparent in the MK steam cured mixes that showed less strength gain at the age of 28 days due to the incorporated pozzolans that did not complete all their pozzolanic reactions at that age. Also, the recorded decrease in compressive strength in 100% MK-RPC can be demonstrated due to the high amounts of hydrogarnet (katoite) and a-C2SH, that are noted to reduce the strength and also due to decrease in the C-S-H [65].\nIt was reported that the positive effect of the pozzolanic reaction of metakaoline occurs after 7 days in which metakaoline affects the strength enhancement of RPC. This observation agrees with the past literature [30].\nIt was observed that, under steam curing the inclusion of 50% MK in RPC resembles the behavior of SF-RPC mixes at late ages. The compressive strength of the autoclaved SF-RPC mixes appeared to be nearly the same value of the compressive strength of the autoclaved 50%MK mixes at 28 and 56 days. This might be due to the presence of the SF that completed the pozzolanic reaction early under autoclaved curing. Additionally, SF particles will complete all their hydration reactions under autoclave curing, but under steam curing, they will not carry out all the pozzolanic reaction. So the behavior of using 50%MK obviously resembles that of SF-RPC at late ages under steam curing while in autoclave they would be the same at both early and late ages because SF needs autoclave curing to develop all the hydration reactions early. Therefore, MK can be used as an available alternative pozzolans in RPC.\nAlso, due the filling effect of MK particles that pack in between the cement grains voids, and the SF particles that pack in between the MK particles. Therefore, the packing density of the RPC mix containing both SF and MK would be remarkably improved leading to a denser microstructure and hence a higher strength [30]. Thus, the co-addition of SF together with MK enhances the strength than the sole addition of MK do. So, the combined addition of (50% SF and 50% MK) would give better strength development than the inclusion of MK only under both steam and autoclave curing.\nIt can be noticed that there is a certain limit of MK content to be added to RPC mix. Beyond this limit, the excess MK content yields to a remarkable reduction in compressive strength because some excessive MK particles remain unhydrated in the binder system.\nGenerally, the pozzolanic reaction of portlandite with both SF and MK account in a formation of more secondary C-S-H that improve the overall strength, in addition to decreasing the total volume of voids under autoclave curing than under steam curing."

Also, the percentages gain of compressive strength of cured specimens compared with the same age are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. At partial substituting of cement by nano clay and nano silica in SF-RPC, it was observed that, the compressive strength recorded a limited improvement at both the early and the late ages under steam and autoclave curing. Also it was observed that it would not matter whether the nano material and the pozzolanic material were from the same base or not. This was appeared in the above results where NS and NC in the SF-RPC mixes resemble each other to a great extent. The experimental results showed that, compared with the ordinary nano clay, the sonicated nano clay after ultrasonic treatment can improve the compressive of RPC at different ages under autoclave curing conditions. This was because the sonicated nanoclay mixes resulted in a denser and well compacted matrix. Finally, nanomaterials have no remarkable impact on SFRPC due to the presence of silica fume which have already a high effective pozzolanic reaction in RPC. So there is no great demand to incorporate nano materials to SF-RPC mixes under steam or autoclave curing."

Also, the percentages gain of compressive strength of cured specimens compared with the same age are shown in Figs. 6 and 7.\nAfter partial substituting of cement by nano clay and nano silica in 100% MK-RPC, it was observed that, the compressive strength recorded a noticed improvement at both the early and the late ages\nunder steam and autoclave curing. The extreme tiny size of nano particles are the most effective aspect that contribute in strength development through filling the voids among RPC mix. These filling effect cause the microstructure to be well compacted and more denser and hence increase the packing density [39,40,66–68]. Additionally, nano silica and nano clay are high reactive pozzolanic materials that react with extra CH resulting in more C-S-H gel leading to remarkable strength improvement which compensate the absence of SF in these mixes.\nMoreover, it was noticed that autoclave curing promote the mechanical strength more than steam curing do in MK-RPC mix incorporating nano materials.\nThe compressive strength results at all ages showed an enhancement with the cement substitution by 3% nanoclay, and then they showed a reduction with the inclusion of 5% nanoclay substitution, but still recording values larger than the control MK-RPC mix. This might be attributed to van der Waals force, in which increasing the nano particles would increase the agglomeration action between themwithout interacting in the RPC mix [48]. When applying sonicated nanoclay with 5% cement replacement, the compressive strength showed high records due to the shattering of the agglomerated particles into scattered particles. Also it was observed that it would not matter whether the nano material and the pozzolanic material were from the same base or not. This was appeared in the above results where NS and NC in the MK-RPC mixes resemble each other to a great extent.\nThese results validates the usefulness of incorporating nanomaterials to MK-RPC mix specially under autoclave curing."

Generally, all the studied specimens possessed highly dense matrix due to the inclusion of high percentages of powdered materials as quartz powder, silica fume particles and the unhydrated cement grains. In Fig. 8(a) the SEM image illustrates the control RPC cured under normal water curing. It was observed the existence of enormous ettringites (C6AS3H32). This compound is a needle shaped structure which can be found in close to the hydrated particles. Also, some unhydrated cement grains could be observed due to the high cement percentages of RPC. Its well known that curing at higher temperature will accelerates the hydration of cement significantly, so heat cured specimens were free in ettringites. In Fig. 8 (b), the steam cured specimen was rich in anhydrous cement particles which indicates the decrease in the rate of hydration. This may be related to the presence of portlandities (C–H) that filled nearly all the gel pores.\nHydrogarnet (katoite) might be detected in the autoclaved MK specimens as reported in past literature [65,69]. The presence of agglomerated hydrogarnet in the mixes containing high percentages of MK might explain the general decrease in compressive strength. Replacing SF with MK under autoclave curing was clearly shown in Fig. 9.\nIn studying the effect of NC and NS under steam and autoclave curing, SEM images were acquired as shown in Figs. 10–13.\nAdding NC with 5% cement replacement was clearly shown in Fig. 10(a-c). Adding NC with 3% cement replacement was clearly shown in Fig. 12. NC performance resembled to a great extent the performance of NS in the RPC. This was cleared in filling the nano-scale pores together with large amount of C-S-H gel resulting from the high pozzolanic reaction of the Ca(OH)2 of the cement hydration reaction. The pozzolanic reaction of NC could be detected from the tiny needle like sheets. These needle sheets as shown in Fig. 10(a) came from the conversion of ball bearing effect as filling particles into pozzolanic reaction compounds [39]. The divergence in the behavior of NC specimen with NS appeared in the presence of small agglomerated fragments of NC. This was attributed to the high percentage of NC particles. Due to nucleation effect of NC, these agglomeration fragments were located around C-S-H. As the agglomeration fragments increase, the bond between cement matrix would be relatively weakened.\nFig. 11 illustrates the impact of cement substitution by NS with 2.5% under autoclave curing. The inclusion of pozzolanic particles represented in the SF and the NS will cause two physical effects in the chemical reaction with the calcium hydroxide which are\npore size refinement and grain size refinement. A very highly packed and dense matrix was achieved due to the formation of excess C-S-H gel that will tightly fill any existed capillary pores leading to pore size refinement. Nucleation of Ca(OH)2 around pozzolanic particles will substitute the large crystals of Ca(OH)2 into many tiny crystals leading to grain size refinement. Additionally, the autoclave cured specimen showed a highly dense microstructure with a grey smooth texture confirming the existence of completely hydrated compounds. This is owing to the effect of autoclave curing that accelerates the pozzolanic activity of the silica fume, in addition to the reaction that occurs between quartz particles and portlandities under high temperature and pressure forming extra (C-S-H)[70].\nEDS analysis was carried out for SF-RPC cured by water, SF-RPC cured by autoclave and RPC-MK% cured by autoclave and the results are presented in Figs. 13–15 for better investigation, respectively. Generally, the curing conditions obviously affect the presence of elements Si, Ca and Al which in turn will enhance the strength and durability of all mixes [71]. The production of C-S-H and other hydrated products would significantly improve the engineering properties. According to Fig. 14, autoclaved SF-RPC has the highest Si/Ca ratio, which confirms its proper strength. In water cured SF-RPC and autoclaved MK-RPC shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 15 respectively, it was observed that this ratio has been decreased. As the amount of Ca increased, the hydration products are reduced.\ner (a) water curing, (b) steam curing.\n(b)(a)\n(c)\nAgglomerated NC particles\nFig. 10.

      "text" : "As known, the sorptivity is one of most important factors that influences the mechanical properties and durability of concrete, hence the decrease in sorptivity indicates that the matrix is a highly compact microstructure. In hardened concrete pores can be categorized into three main types: gel pores, capillary pores, and air voids. Air voids cause a decrease in strength as their percent increase [72]. It was observed from the results of compressive\nstrength that steam curing enhanced the strength development of RPC significantly. Despite this improvement in strength, steam curing was noticed to increase the water sorptivity of the SF-RPC specimens, when compared to those cured in normal water and autoclave curing as shown in the following figures. The elevated temperature during steam curing have caused heat deterioration impact in the concrete microstructure. The increase in the temperature up to 90 C motivated the allocation of hydration products to be heterogeneous and hence might result in the appearance of surface cracks [73,74]. Additionally, the dehydration in the water content during steam curing might result in extra free opened pore structure in the concrete surface [75–77]. Besides, in autoclave curing, the pozzolanic activity is accelerated due to applied pressure\nFig. 14. EDS analysis of SF-RPC cured by autoclave.\nFig. 15.

This in turn results in a more compacted matrix and the absence of many cracks and this emphasis why elevated temperatures of steam curing lead to cracking then it would not have been the same for autoclave.\nThis comply with the literatures which reported that the autoclaved curing generally improves the capillary porosity and at the same time decreases the gel porosity of hydrated cement paste [79,79].\nBesides, it was noticed that autoclaved RPC based silica fume exhibited lower sorptivity than those were steam cured as shown in Fig. 16. On the other hand, the inclusion of MK in RPC was shown to decrease sorptivity under steam curing more than specimens cured by autoclave. This can be shown in Fig. 17 and Fig. 18. It was observed that the compressive strength of SF-RPC is signifi-\ncantly greater than that of MK50, but the total water absorption of SF-RPC is larger. This may be attributed to the presence of many gel pores in the MK50% that results in reduction in strength. The enhancement in MK steam cured specimens was attributed to the pozzolanic reaction of the MK which react with the present calcium hydroxide performing a modified pore structure [26,80,81] so the pore structure of high-strength concrete can be improved by replacing 50% SF with MK under steam curing [82]. This enhancement can be due to the pozzolanic reaction of MK which is thermally been activated under steam curing conditions [21,83]. The increase in sorptivity in MK specimens cured under autoclave\nmight be due to the increasing amounts of both hydrogarnet (katoite) and a-C2SH, [69] and due to the general decrease in the CS-H binding gel [65] in the mixes containing high percentages of MK. So in order to achieve improved durability properties in RPC, available MK can be utilized under steam curing in RPC development with 50% replacement level.\nAdditionally, Figs. 19–22 revealed that incorporating nano materials to RPC would significantly decrease the sorpotivity results under both steam and autoclave curing. This might be attributed to the effect of nano materials in increasing the packing density of RPC mix and hence filling the present pores. As mentioned before, nano clay and nano silca would also undergo pozzolanic reaction which in turn help in the formation of extra C-SH gel and hence contribute in refining pore structure of the RPC mix. The sorptivity results for all the designed mixes can be shown in Fig. 23."

      "text" : "The size of pores among the microstructure of concrete ranges widely from nanometer to micrometer [84]. There are four kinds of pores which are harmless pores smaller than (20 nm), less harmful pores (20–50 nm), harmful pores (50–200 nm), and more harmful pores larger than (200 nm) [64]. It was reported that both harmless pores and less harmful pores are definitely very small where there is no drawbacks on the strength and permeability of concrete. While, harmful pores and more harmful pores are considered large pores that found to have bad influence on the strength and permeability of concrete [64]. To determine the distribution of pores, the normalized volume of mercury intrusion with various ranges of pore width, greater than 200, 50–200, 20–50 and less than 20 nm, was calculated from the intrusion curves, and the results are shown in Fig. 24.\nIt was reported that silica fume remarkably reduced the porosity and average pore diameter of concrete under all curing conditions more than metakaoline. MIP measurements proved that the incorporation of silica fume leads to reduction of capillary pores more than metakaoline.\nAdding nano materials to RPC results in lower porosity ratio, when compared to the control RPC, which indicates that there is a lower number of capillary pores due to the pozzolanic reactivity of nano materials and their filling effect.\nHeat treatment caused a reduction of total porosity for RPC. This is due to the full cement hydration process under autoclave curing that promotes the microstructure and the porosity of the mixture. Generally, it was observed that there is a linear correlation among compressive strength, sorptivity and the pore size distribution.\nSF-RPC-Steam curing SF-NS-2.5%-Steam curing\nSF-NC-3%-Steam curing SF-NC-5%-Steam curing"

Accordingly, concrete with nano particles has greater stiffness than concrete without nano particles. The values of stiffness in concrete containing nanosilica and nano clay are due to the packing and the compactness of the paste bond with nanoparticles that is greater than that without nano particles [86].\nThe strong matrix which is relatively free from homogeneity due to pore refinement in autoclave cured mixes specially will\ncause the microstructure to execute efficient load transfer among its particles. So, high elastic modulus and mechanical behavior are assigned to the improved microstructure. Also, it was observed that there is a compatibility between the experimental and the predicted elastic modulus results."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "1. Thermal curing treatment enhanced the compressive strength in RPC more than standard water curing on early and late ages due to the inclusion of high ratios of pozzolans. Autoclave curing significantly promotes RPC strength.\n2. MK can be used as an available alternative to SF in RPC with replacement reaches 50%. The 50% replacement may not be the maximum good percentage but it is preferable than 100%replacement. The fact that the silica fume is being unavailable in our country, leads to accept the reduction in strength when utilizing the available metakaoline and nano clay. This conclusion is satisfying especially the reduction in strength in 50% metakaoline RPC in 28 and 56 days ranges between 2% and 18% under steam and autoclave curing. 3. Adding nano materials to RPC containing the high pozzolanic SF the will not achieve a remarkable enhancement in the compressive strength, while adding nano materials to MK-RPC mixes could redeem the properties of common RPC. 4. For RPC mixes incorporated by nano materials, the SEM showed their effects in the RPC matrix through the nucleation and the filling effect in addition to the pozzolanic reaction. Agglomerated NC particles are found which clarifies the decrease in strength in the mixes containing 5% NC. 5. An agreement is reported in the results of the experimental elastic modulus and the predicted ACI elastic modulus equation for high strength concrete.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."

This paper studies the impact of using metakaoline (MK) as an available alternative pozzolans to replace silica fume (SF) in the development of RPC in Egypt. The influence of incorporating nano materials in RPC is also investigated. Different curing techniques were applied on nineteen different mixes to evaluate the compressive strength, sorptivity, elastic modulus. The microstructure study was also performed with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray (EDS) Spectroscopy analysis in addition to Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry test (MIP). The results showed that the blended SF and MK enhanced the strength and the durability of the RPC. Autoclave curing promotes RPC mixes to early reach their maximum strength. Also it was observed that adding nano materials wouldn’t achieve a remarkable enhancement in the compressive strength nor durability of RPC comparing with the enhancement recorded in traditional concrete. 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
