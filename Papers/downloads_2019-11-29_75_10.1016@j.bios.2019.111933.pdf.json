Introduction\nRapid and reliable detection of pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium remains challenging in the realm of clinical microbiology. In this context, several conventional approaches have been used based on culture systems, such as detecting nucleic acids or immunological reactions (Atashpaz et al. 2010; Forouhandeh et al. 2010; Ghotaslou et al. 2013; Ghotaslou et al. 2010; Nemati et al. 2016; Sani et al. 2018; Shahi et al. 2018; Vahed et al. 2011). Despite the recent progress in the pathogen detection approaches, their use is still limited since they are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, the development of novel “rapid, sensitive and specific” analytical biosensors for the identification of pathogens is of paramount importance. Biosensors are analytical devices that combine a biological recognition mechanism with physical transduction, which enables the selective and sensitive recognition of a range of analytes (Bettazzi et al. 2013; Eftekhari et al. 2018; Hamidi-Asl et al. 2015b; Hamidi Asl et al. 2015; Labib et al. 2009; Labib et al. 2016b; Pournaghi-Azar et al. 2008; Raoof et al. 2011b). In addition, biosensors have been recently proposed as appealing surrogates of traditional diagnostic tools to detect and quantify bacteria (Liu et al. 2016). Aptamers are defined as single-stranded nucleic acid strands that are selected against a specific target through iterative rounds of selection. Aptamers offer several advantages over traditional antibodies, including their stability, relatively small size, lack of immunogenicity, and ease of chemical modification (Labib et al. 2012e; Muharemagic et al. 2012a). Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) in vitro is often employed to aptamers against a target analyte ranging in size from a small molecule to a whole cell (Lee et al. 2013; Muharemagic et al. 2012b; Stoltenburg et al. 2007; Wilson and Szostak 1999; Zununi Vahed et al. 2018). Despite the lack of preceding data of particular targets, a counter-selection method using non-targets significantly improves the selectivity of the selected aptamers. Recent studies have demonstrated that combining aptamers with different nanomaterials can result in the production of sensing platforms with paramount sensitivity that can be employed for the early detection of infectious diseases (Eftekhari et al. 2018; Raoof et al. 2009; Raoof et al. 2011a; Zununi Vahed et al. 2018). Various types of nanoparticles ranging from metal to carbon-based materials such as carbon nanotubes, graphite and graphene have been developed and used for immobilization of recognition elements or amplification of detection signals in bioanalytical applications (Asghary et al. 2015; Hamidi-Asl et al. 2015a; Hamidi-Asl et al. 2016b; Iqbal et al. 2015).\n5\nAccordingly, due to the progressive need and demand for using aptasensors for various applications, many recent studies have focused on the utilization of aptamer-conjugated nanomaterials in biomedical applications, such as detection of pathogenic bacteria in food contamination and infectious diseases (Labib et al. 2012a, c; Mocan et al. 2017; Shahdordizadeh et al. 2017; Sharma and Raghavarao 2019; Wu et al. 2019). The present review addresses the recent advances in development of aptamer-conjugated nanomaterials and their applications in the detection of various pathogens in infectious diseases and food contamination.\n6\nDue to their potential applications, aptamer production has increased dramatically over the past few years. Aptamers are favorably employed in biosensors as sensitive and selective bioreceptors with various transduction strategies that can be electrochemical, mass-sensitive and optical. The target analytes usually range in size from small molecules (e.g., amino acids, nucleotides, peptides, proteins, cofactors and polysaccharides) to complex organizations such as whole cells (Labib et al. 2016a), viruses (Giamberardino et al. 2013; Labib et al. 2012d; Wehbe et al. 2015), bacteria (Labib and Berezovski 2014; Labib et al. 2012b), and parasites (Iqbal et al. 2015). In the next sections, we will discuss a variety of nanomaterials that can be implemented into sensing platforms to produces aptasensors with unique analytical properties.\n3. Nanomaterial-based aptasensors\nRecent advances in the area of nanotechnology have led to the advances in nanoscale science and technology and synthesis of a variety of nanomaterials such as transducers with exceptional electronic, optical, catalytic and magnetic properties. On balance, the decrease in the material dimension (between 1-100 nm), noticeably improves the analytical performance of the sensor without altering its properties. The resultant large surface-to-volume ratio significantly enhances the interaction between the sensor and the analyte, allowing for the sensitive detection of analytes (Chen et al. 2010). Importantly, nano-biosensors can detect the real-time physiological statues of the patients and examine the toxicities and pollution in environmental and food specimens (Maojo et al. 2010).\n3.1 Metal and metal oxide nanoparticles"

      "text" : "Gold nanomaterials are characterized by their unusual electronic and optical properties, controllable morphology and high stability (Yang et al. 2015b). Their ease of synthesis as well as their special spectral properties have made them superior in bioanalytical applications. One of the common means of Au NPs production is through chemical reduction of AuCl4 ions by citric acid. This approach has been specifically useful as the size of particle can be specifically regulated (Daniel and Astruc 2004; Frenkel et al. 2005). Aptamer-conjugated gold nanomaterials have been successfully employed to develop highly sensitive sensing platforms which are listed in Table 1.\n7\nA study conducted by Wang et al. showed that a magnetically assisted surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (MA-SERS) aptasensor has been utilized to detect S. aureus. In this study, the aptasensor consisted of Ag-coated magnetic NPs (a SERS substrate) and a new SERS tag (AuNR-DTNB@Ag-DTNB core-shell plasmonic NPs or DTNB-labeled insideand-outside plasmonic NPs, DioPNPs) (Figure 2). The nanoparticles were synthesized using polymer polyethylenimine in the monodisperse, uniform and superparamagnetic form with satisfactory SERS function and magnetic response. Moreover, the sample sedimentation was prevented by magnetic enrichment instead of repeated centrifugation. This novel SERS mapping approach was shown to achieve fast, highly sensitive and specific single-cell detection of S. aureus (Wang et al. 2015).\n8\n(AuNR−DTNB@Ag−DTNB) synthesis and their conjugation with aptamer 2. (c) Schematic bases for the detection of S. aureus (reproduced from ref. (Wang et al. 2015) with permission).\nIn another study by Chang et al, a combination of a DNA aptamer and GNPs was used for the detection of S. aureus. Briefly, they first generated aptamers, which were conjugated with GNPs via thio-DNA adaptors and then two approaches were employed to detect the interaction of aptamer-GNPs and S. aureus, including direct detection and bead-amplification methods. In the direct detection method, the aptamer-GNPs were incubated with S. aureus followed by analyzing the eluted bound aptamer-GNPs by monitoring the light-scattering signals. (Figure 3) (Chang et al. 2013). In the bead-based amplification, they used a combination of biotin-aptamer-GNPs, magnetic beads aptamer-GNPs conjugates to detect the interaction of aptamer-GNPs conjugates with S. aureus using a magnet. Similar to the direct detection method, the light-scattering signals were analyzed as the readout. This new simple platform technology may have a great implication in rapid and sensitive multiplex detection of pathogens in the clinical settings (Chang et al. 2013).\n9\n10\nInterestingly, aptasensors have also been employed for the detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has become a real concern in hospital-acquired infections. In a recent study, detection of whole P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 cell was successfully achieved using the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-based nanosensor technology. Briefly, a sandwich of biotinylated polyethylene glycol, neutravidin, and biotinylated aptamers was produced in which the surface contained a hexagonal array of Au NPs fabricated by nanospheres lithography (Hu et al. 2018). This LSPR sensing platform can be used for clinical diagnostics and therapeutic purposes. Biotinylated aptamers and colorimetric aptasensor have been also successfully employed to detect Salmonella typhimurium. In the former method, the bound bacteria were detected through the application of a secondary Au NPs-based aptamers after adding a silver enhancer solution. Whereas the later method relies on the color change of Au NPs, both methods resulted in specific and sensitive detection of S. typhimurium (Ma et al. 2017). Labib et al. developed a different aptasensor to detect viable but nonculturable (VBNC) microorganisms. Their method involved SELEX platform to select highly specific DNA aptamer for detection of live S. typhimurium in 12 rounds. Every round encompassed positive and negative selection steps for live and the heat killed S. typhimurium, respectively. Moreover, a mixture of related bacteria confirmed the specificity of the selected aptamers. Consequently, an impedimetric sensor was developed using a screen-printed carbon electrode modified with Au NPs. Interestingly, this fabricated aptasensor was able to distinguish between S. typhimurium and other Salmonella species (Labib et al. 2012c). In another study, Cheng et al. used a combined aptamer/antibiotic dual recognition unit with magnetic enrichment for detection of S. aureus through a fluorescent intensity measurement. A simple one-step procedure was used to prepare the sensor, which contained aptamer-coated magnetic beads that specifically capture S. aureus vancomycin-stabilized fluorescent Au nanoclusters (AuNCs@Van). The applied technique could efficiently simplify the fabrication of the fluorescent probes, which sensitively and accurately quantified S. aureus in the presence of other bacteria with higher concentrations. A dual aptamer antibiotic binding biosensor has also been developed using fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) to identify the S. aureus cell wall. A nucleic acid aptamer and vancomycin were employed to provide a dual recognition unit. More specifically, gold nanoclusters and nanoparticles were used to modify vancomycin as energy donor and aptamer as an energy acceptor. As a result, the FRET signal revealed a linear relation to the bacterial count (20-108 CFU/mL) with 10 CFU/mL detection limit (LOD).\n11\nThe pathogenic bacteria M. tuberculosis secretee a specific fused antigen called CFP10ESAT6 in its early culture period. He et al. has recently used this specific antigen to fabricate an aptamer-based sensor using Au NPs (Au-IDE/CFP10-ESAT6 aptamer/DNA-Au NPs) for the rapid detection of the pathogen. An Au-IDE/CFP10-ESAT6 aptamer/DNA-AuNPs probe was prepared through modification of CFP10-ESAT6 aptamer to electrode surface by Au–S bond. After that, double-stranded structure modified the complementary DNA-AuNPs to electrode. Upon the formation of tight complexes of aptamer and CFP10-ESAT6 antigen on the electrode, DNA-Au NPs fragments detached from the surface, which allowed for the pathogen detection by IDE-MSPQC sensor.\n12\nTable 1.

In the presence of P. aeruginosa, the aptamer gives up the surface of GNP, permitting GNPs to resume their peroxidase-like activity, resulting in oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′- tetramethylbenzidine (TMB).\n(Das et al. 2019)\nM. tuberculosis (antigen MPT64)\nElectrochemical 10 CFU/mL - An amino-modified Zr(IV) was prepared with a high specific surface and utilized as the carrier of the gold NPs and the aptamers. After HRP coating of the nanomaterials, the signaling nanoprobe was prepared. The two aptamers were attached on the gold electrode with a synergistic effect on binding to MPT64 antigen. (Li et al. 2018b)\nShigella dysenteriae Electrochemical 100 CFU/mL - By electrodeposition method, a GCE was modified with AuNPs. After that, a thiolated-aptamer was self-assembled on the modified GCE surface for detection of S. dysenteriae. The interaction between outer-membrane proteins of the bacterium and the aptamer led to an increase in the detection sensitivity. Dead bacteria cells did not results in any significant binding.\n(Zarei et al. 2018)\nCampylobacter jejuni Colorimetric 100 CFU/mL - Uptake of aptamer from solution occurred after binding with the cell membrane. Therefore, the aptamer floating concentration was decreased in the solution. Through electrostatic interactions, the surface of added Au@Pd NPs is covered with aptamer. Therefore, they could not function as a peroxidase mimic to oxidize the TMB and give a blue product.\n(Dehghani et al. 2018)\nS. typhimurium surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)\n35 CFU/mL 1 h S. typhimurium was detected by means of DNA-assembled gold nanodimers (AuNDs). AuNPs (35 nm i.d.) were functionalized with the ssDNA 1 aptamer and utilized as the capture probe; however, smaller AuNPs (15 nm) were modified with a Cy3-labeled complementary sequence (ssDNA 2) and utilized as the signaling probe. The asymmetric AuNDs were combined with the Raman signal probe and capture probe by hybridization of the complementary ssDNAs. The gap between two NPs is a \"hot spot\" where the Raman reporter Cy3 is localized. S. typhimurium could bound by the aptamer.\n(Xu et al. 2018)\nS. aureus Colorimetric 9 CFU/mL - First, through biotin-avidin binding, the biotinylated aptamer was immobilized on the microtiter plate wells surface. Then, the S. aureus, biotinylated-aptamer-streptavidin-HRP conjugates, hydrogen peroxide, biotinylated-tyramine, and avidin-catalase were introduced into the microtiter plate wells. Then, hydrogen peroxide consumed by the existing catalase. After adding the gold (III) chloride trihydrate, the color of the reaction changed. (Yuan et al. 2014) S. typhimurium Colorimetric 10 CFU/mL - The aptamers were immobilized onto the MNPs (as concentration elements) and AuNPs (as reporters) surface. The aptamers on the surface of NPs bound to the S. typhimurium specifically and form a MNPs-aptamer-S. typhimurium-aptamer-AuNPs sandwich structure complex. These complexes were separated from the solution in a magnetic field, resulting in a reduction of the UV/Vis signal. (Duan et al. 2016b) S. typhimurium Localized surface Plasmon resonance (LSPR)\n104 CFU/mL 30-35 min A plasmonic active sensing chip was utilized to detect bacteria. AuNPs (20 nm) were homogenously deposited on a transparent substrate that produced longitudinal wavelength extinction shifts via a LSPR signal. Then the AuNPs-based plasmonic sensors were conjugated with aptamers through the dipping adsorption method.\n(Oh et al. 2017)\n13\nUCNPs: upconversion nanoparticles, cDNA: complementary DNA, AuNPs: gold nanoparticles, 3D: three-dimensional, HRP: horseradish peroxidase, GCE: glassy carbon electrode, NPs: nanoparticles, UV/Vis: ultraviolet/visible\nEscherichia coli Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)\n3 CFU/mL 20 min AuNPs were conjugated with aptamers as acceptor and UCNPs were functionalized with the corresponding cDNA as the donor. The spectral overlap between AuNPs absorption and UCNPs fluorescence emission allowed for the occurrence of FRET upon hybridization of targeted aptamer and cDNA. In the presence of target bacteria, binding of aptamers to bacteria led to the formation of a 3D structure and separation of AuNPs-aptamers from UCNPs-cDNA, resulting in the recovery of up conversion fluorescence.\n(Jin et al. 2017)\nS. enterica serovar Typhimurium (STM)\nColorimetric 1 × 103 CFU/mL\n3 h Aptamer-modified magnetic particles captured STM and which became subsequently bound to detection antibodies. For amplification of the colorimetric signal, horseradish peroxidase molecules were utilized.\n(Wu et al. 2014b)\nS. typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7\nColorimetric\n105 CFU/mL 20 min or less\nFor binding to bacteria, target aptamers were adsorbed on the AuNPs surface that was not modified. The identification of bacteria was carried out through aggregation of the aptasensor which is induced by target bacteria. Using high-salt conditions, binding event was associated with a color change from red to purple.\n(Wu et al. 2012a)\nCronobacter sakazakii\nColorimetric 7.1 × 103 CFU/mL\n30 min - (Kim et al. 2017)\nC. jejuni and Campylobacter coli\nColorimetric 108 CFU/mL 30 min Two-stage label-free aptasensor platform was established.

The heterogeneous detection and particular S. typhimurium binding with aptamer released the primer binding part where several circular templates were anchored on the surface of aptasensor. At that point, to produce large amount of long DNA sequences with multiple tandemrepeat sequences, the RCA reaction was started. For enzyme-amplified electrochemical readout on the aptasensor surface, the products of RCA became bound to biotinylated detection probes. (Ge et al. 2018) Vibrio fischeri Colorimetric 4 × 101 to 4 × 105 CFU/mL - Method was based on the aptamer sandwich assay between DNA aptamer probes and live bacteria.

      "text" : "Recent studies have revealed the capability of silver (Ag) NPs in the fabrication of novel medical devices including several types of biosensors. In a recent study, Zhang et al. generated silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) using DNA-scaffolds which resulted in the elevation of the fluorescent intensity of AgNCs and, in turn, recognition of viable S. typhimurium. In this study, they used an intelligently designed sensor system as a hairpin shaped AgNCS that contained a triple trigger sequences-reformed strand dislocation amplification. The aptamertriggered sequence complex liberated the single-stranded trigger sequence in the presence of the bacteria, which in turn commenced a branch migration, opening the hairpin template I. The hairpin template II was then opened through a branch migration when the first strand dislocation amplification was stimulated resulting in the formation of several scaffolds of Ag NCs and receptor strands. The third branch of migration started through the inducer effect of the second strand dislocation amplification, which then produced numerous scaffolds of Ag NCs and triggered the related sequences. Because of continuous cycles in which the sequences were triggered, highly fluorescent Ag NCs were formed and the fluorescent signal was subsequently enhanced. The developed system was able to detect alive S. typhimurium with LOD of 50 CFU/mL (Zhang et al. 2017). Abbaspour et al. developed an aptasensor, which sensitively detected the target by Ag NPs conjugated secondary anti-S.aureus aptamer. The dual-aptamer sandwich generated on the magnetic beads (MBs) surface produced an electrochemical signal of NPs upon binding to the bacteria. MBs were used as transporters of affinity agents in the solution-phase detection while the Ag NPS significantly amplified the produced signal to achieve a simple and sensitive platform (Abbaspour et al. 2015). Leng et al. also described a fluorometric system for the identification of S. typhimurium in which a hairpin probe (HAP) was used to identify the connection between labeled DNA and G-quadruplex DNAzyme via a modified target photoinduced electron transfer (PET) approach. The HAP-dependent circular exponential amplifications allowed this fluorescencebased sensor to detect S. typhimurium with a LOD of 8 CFU/mL. Importantly, the developed AgNPs aptasensor approach can be employed using only one-step homogeneous reaction."

      "heading" : "3.1.4 Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)",
      "text" : "Iron oxides are abundant in the environment and can be easily produced in laboratories (Gupta and Gupta 2005; Wu et al. 2008). Synthesis of magnetic IONPs is specifically important due to their implementation in microfluidics-integrated sensors (Labib et al. 2018; Nemr et al. 2019). Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have recently attracted much consideration for biomedical applications offering exceptional advantages over other nanomaterials due to their physicochemical stability, inexpensive production, environmental safety as well as biocompatibility (Green et al. 2017; Green et al. 2016; Wu et al. 2015). Superparamagnetic IONPs have emerged as a popular aptasensor material given their ability to reversibly switch in reaction to an exterior magnetic power (Yi et al. 2013). Prominently, an atomic layer such as Al2O3, Au and Ag could be used to modify the surfaces of the MNPs. This metal layer can act as effective conjugating locations for several labeling groups and ligands such as proteins, aptamers and fluorescent dyes (Berry 2009). Combination of cell-specific aptamers with multifunctional MNPs adds extra advantages to the nanoparticles by enabling the detection of live cells. Aptamer-conjugated-MNPs (AptMNPs) can also have a broad application in non-invasive separation, extraction as well as enrichment of target cells without any need for multiple centrifugation steps. Besides, once MNPs are combined with other detecting agents, they could act as an amplified signal producer. Table 2 summarizes some of the developed MNPs-based aptasensors that are used for detection of pathogens. A recent study by Duan et al. demonstrated efficient and fast ability of apt-MNPs in capturing bacterial cells such as E. coli, Listeria and S. typhimurium. Based on this report, the detection of bacterial cells was eventually visualized by highly sensitive methods such as fluorophore-conjugated aptamers (Duan et al. 2013a) or real-time qPCR (Ozalp et al. 2014).\n16\nDuan et al. utilized SELEX to produce specific DNA-based aptamers for detection of Vibrio parahemolyticus. Based on their findings, the aptamer was utilized to capture the aforementioned bacterium, allowing for its identification in a complex sample like food. Moreover, they showed by using a magnetic field that the aptamer-conjugated MNPs were able to capture and concentrate the target bacteria. Importantly, chemically-modified aptamers conjugated to highly sensitive detection probes such as enzymatic probes and/or fluorescent may offer great potential in food-safety (Duan et al. 2012a). Wu et al. have developed a multiplex method for the concurrent identification of three different pathogenic microorganisms via the application of nanoparticles. They used multicolored upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as luminescence labels attached to aptamers. This technique has been specifically very useful for the specific detection of the pathogenic bacteria in complex food products (Wu et al. 2014a). In a recent study, Ma et al. have shown that several MNPs were capable of adsorbing DNA, suggesting that engineering of the surface is an important parameter in controlling different interactions. They then showed that ssDNA assembly with polyethylenimine (PEI) coatedMNPs (PEI-MNPs) was mediated by the phosphate backbones of DNA and the electrostatic interactions with the surface charges of MNPs. The interaction with PEI-MNPs substantially quenched the fluorescence of labeled DNA via static quenching. In addition, this interaction with DNA was used for developing a new aptasensor. This has been proven by the sensitive and specific lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sensing with a LOD of 35 ng/mL in which the linear range varied from 50 ng/mL to 10 µg/mL. They also revealed that this sensor is advantageous compared to graphene oxide (GO)-ssDNA aptamer sensors due to the elimination of nonspecific DNA displacement by interfering proteins which leads to the generation of more satisfactory signal-to-background ratio and thereby to serve as a supplement to classic GO‒ DNA sensors (Ma et al. 2018).\n17\nTable 2. Magnetic nanoparticles-based aptasenosrs for detection of pathogenic bacteria\nBacteria Detection method Detection limit (CFU/mL) Detection speed Method References S. aureus E. coli Magnetic separation and detection 10–2000 CFU/mL\n2 hours For bacterial enrichment, fresh blood and Apt-Fe3O4@mTiO2 nanoparticles were incubated. The aptamer has a high affinity and selectivity to the target bacteria. The pathogens captured by AptFe3O4@mTiO2 sensor became more concentrated by virtue of the magnetic field. (Shen et al. 2016)\nP. aeruginosa Fluorometric\n1 CFU/mL <1.5 h The hybridization of aptamer and fluorescein-labeled complementary DNA (FAM-cDNA) using magnetic separation was the basis of this sensor. The assembly of FAM-cDNA on the surface of magnetic particles occured in the absence of the bacteria while the presence of bacteria resulted in the release of FAM-cDNA from the magnetic particles. The fluorescence intensity correlated with the number of bacteria in the sample. (Zhong et al. 2018)\nV. parahemolyticus Colorimetric 10 CFU/mL - The strategy of the detection relied on the competitional binding of V. parahemolyticus and the complementary strand to the aptamer. Using G-quadruplex DNAzyme has led to a significant signal amplification.\n(Sun et al. 2019)\nS. aureus S. typhimurium\nOptical 35 CFU/mL 15 CFU/mL\n- An aptamer was used as a signal probe for and S. typhimurium and S. aureus and GNPs were modified with Raman molecules.

When the apteners were immobilized on the magnetic beads, it enabled the preconcentration and activation steps. This mechanism provided a platform for fast bacteria concentration and a QCM examination for selective and realistic monitoring.\n(Ozalp et al. 2015)\nS. aureus\nResonance frequency measurement\n5 CFU/mL 5-6 min Combination of aptamer and magnetoelastic sensors to design an aptamer-enhanced magnetoelastic wireless diagnosis system.\n(Rahman et al. 2015)\nS. typhimurium S. aureus\nOptical 5 CFU/mL 8 CFU/mL\n40 min Aptamer 1 and aptamer 2 were immobilized onto the MNPs exterior part that was used to detect and concentrate of S. aureus and S. typhimurium.

      "text" : "In another study, Pathania et al. designed an electrochemical aptasensor, which was synthesized from MoS2-rGO and was able to detect S. typhimurium via binding to the Vi\n19\npolysaccharide antigen. The optimal levels of rGO and MoS2 were used to prepare MoS2rGO nanocomposite via a liquid-assisted exfoliation system. The synergistic effects of the nanocomposites were due to the enhanced conductivity and simple bio-functionalization properties. A stable biointerface was provided via embedding the screened anti-Vi aptamer on the nanocomposites through thiol linkages. The results showed that the sensors had high selectivity and was able to detect the bacteria in the presence of closely-related targets (Pathania et al. 2018).\n3.2 Carbon-based nanomaterials\nCarbon nanomaterials (e.g., single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and graphene) have become a popular sensor material for the detection of bacteria (Duan et al. 2014; Maurer et al. 2012; Muniandy et al. 2019). Their capacity as a quencher or transducer along with their high elasticity as well as their tunable bandgap enabled their incorporation in pathogen detection systems (Zhu et al. 2010). Moreover, ssDNA molecules are favorably adsorbed on carbonbased nanomaterials due to their hydrophobic surfaces. This is performed via π-stacking interactions between the sidewalls of the carbon nanomaterials and the nucleotide bases (Zheng et al. 2003). A summary for these carbon nanomaterials-based approaches for aptasensing of pathogens are provided in Table 3."

      "text" : "Scientifically, CNTs have received tremendous attention due to their specific characteristics such as chemical, thermal, electrical and mechanical properties. Their capability of enabling the detection of target molecules in the trace amounts stemmed from their high surface areato-volume ratio along with the rapid transduction of physical or chemical interactions (Yang et al. 2015a). Zelada-Guillen and coworkers designed a SWCNT-bases aptasensor for the identification of distinct microorganisms (Zelada-Guillén et al. 2013). Apt-SWCNT method has been successfully used to identify bacteria such as S. aureus, S. paratyphi, and E. coli with high sensitivity (Zelada-Guillén et al. 2013; Zelada-Guillén et al. 2012). In the AptSWCNT-based approaches, SWCNTs were deposited onto a glassy electrode surface containing a potentiometer. The covalent conjugation of SWCNTs to the synthetized aptamer provided a good platform capable of targeting and capturing the specific bacteria. Binding of the aptamer to the bacteria altered its charge and conformation and caused a difference in the potential. These approaches have been demonstrated to be useful due to their sensitivity\n20\nallowing for rapid detection of 1 CFU/mL of S. typhimurium. Furthermore, the aptamer was regenerated and reused. A rapid and precise sensing platform for M. tuberculosis has been reported by Zhang and coworkers who utilized a ssDNA aptamer against M. tuberculosis (strain H37Rv) to generate a specific sensor for this strain. A Piezoelectric quartz crystal on a gold electrode was modified with a thiol-modified aptasensor. SWCNTs were then bonded to the aptamer by π-π stacking. In the presence of the target, the aptamer substituted the SWCNTs since H37Rv produced stronger binding with the aptamer than SWCNTs, thereby leading to a large change in the electrical properties. Importantly, this sensor discriminated H37Rv from the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine (BCG) and M. smegmatis. Hasan et al. used multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)-based ITO electrodes in an amino-modified aptasensor to enable Salmonella detection. Binding of the amino-based aptamer (ssDNA) with the carboxy-rich MWCNTs-ITO electrodes generated the sensing interface. The presence of bacteria resulted in the increase of the impedance of the electrode surface. The LODs were estimated to be 5.5 × 101 and 6.7 × 101 CFU/ mL for S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium, respectively(Hasan et al. 2018).\n3.2.2 Graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO)\nGraphene oxides (GO) are in the center of attention for fabricating highly sensitive sensing platforms. Their biocompatibility, low-cost, natural source, changes in oxidation level, size controllability, and distinct thermal, mechanical and electrical characteristics have aligned them as material of choice in nanomedicine and nanosensors. GO with an epoxide, phenol hydroxyl, and carboxylic groups can be easily generated from GO. Graphite oxides have been employed in the sensors for the identification of biomolecules (Chou et al. 2012; Krishnan et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019; Yao et al. 2012). Biocompatibility, unique interaction with bases of the aptamer, large surface-to-volume ratio and high electron transfer capacity have elected reduced GO (rGO) as reliable nanoplatforms for the detection of various pathogens. The rGO-azophloxine (AP) nano-aptasensor was designed for a prompt, robust, and sensitive recognition of specific food-derived pathogens using an electrochemical approach. The AP dye provided a conductive and soluble rGO nanocomposite in addition to acting as an indicator of redox reactions. The nano-aptasensor allowed for detection of S. typhimurium with a linear range of 10-108 and a LOD of 101 CFU/mL (Figure 5) (Muniandy et al. 2017).\n21\nFigure 5. Synthesis of the rGO-functionalized AP and its further utilization for the detection of S. typhimurium using an electrochemical approach. Reproduced from (Muniandy et al. 2017) with permission.\nAn aptasensor comprising a capture and a signal probe was developed based on Klenow fragment-assisted target recycling amplification and GO for sensitive and rapid detection of E. coli. Carboxygluoroscein labeled signal probes acted as the primer sequence. In the absence of bacteria, the probe formed an incomplete double-stranded connection on the GO where no fluorescence is generated. However, incubation with the target resulted in the formation of an aptamer-target complex, which caused the separation of the GO from the formed-complex resulting in the fluorescence recovery. The LOD was 1 × 102 CFU/mL.\n3.2.3 Carbon nanowires (CNWs)\nCNWs can be integrated into a variety of sensing platforms due to their small size, electronic properties and high surface-to-volume ratio. Despite their advantages, their fabrication is limited due to the costly methods (Doucey and Carrara 2019; Thiha et al. 2018). A simple fabrication method was recently developed by Thiha et al. for suspended CNWs based sensors (sub-100 nm) using photolithography and electrospinning approaches. Fabrication of high aspect ratio carbon structures has been achieved by microelectromechanical Systems (CMEMS) methods via pyrolysis. For label-free chemi-resistive biosensing, suspended CNWs were integrated with a microfluidic chip and functionalized with Salmonella-specific aptamer probes to form a lab-on-chip device. The designed sensor was able to detect Salmonella in a\n22\nsample volume of 5 µL within 5 min, with acceptable selectivity and sensitivity and a LOD of 10 CFU/mL (Thiha et al. 2018).\n24\n3.3. Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs)\nSilica nanoparticles (SiNPS) with size range of 5-1000 nm are highly biocompatible materials that are commonly proposed as potential candidates for various biomedical application (Jafari et al. 2019). Moreover, SiNPS can form conjugates with different recognition elements such as aptamers to produce aptasensors (Castillo et al. 2019). In this context, Shangguan et al. utilized a combined approach of positive dielectrophoresis (pDEP) and aptamer-fluorescent SiNPs for detection of S. aureus using a microfluidic device. In this study, the S. aureus aptamer NP bioconjugates (AptS.aureus/FNPs) were prepared through a simple chemical modification in which a high-affinity aptamer was immobilized on the bacteria via chloropropyl-functionalized SiNPs. The AptS.aureus/FNP labelled S. aureus were transferred to the electrode within the pDEP frequency region, whereas the non-labelled NPs were flown away. In comparison with other AptS.aureus/FNP based flow cytometry techniques, this method was capable of identifying S. aureus with LODs of 270 and 93 CFU/mL in spiked and deionized water samples, respectively. Furthermore, the assay was completed in a short period because there was no need for prior separation and washing steps (Shangguan et al. 2015). Modified DNA oligonucleotides have also emerged as another approach to determine the activity of released nuclease from the bacteria in order to detect releasing pathogen. Borsa et al. used this technique and designed an aptamer functionalized Si MNPs that was not affected from the interference of blood constituents during fluorescence measurements. This aptasensor successfully detected S. aureus with a LOD of 682 CFU in whole blood (Borsa et al. 2016). Protein A is an important biomarker for S. aureus infection. Urmann and coworkers developed an optical sensor for recognition of protein A using a particular Si-modified aptamer. The optical transducer part of the sensor contained a porous thin film of Si on which the protein A-binding aptamer was immobilized as the capture probe. The sensor permitted a linear detection range of 8-23 µM (Urmann et al. 2017). In another study, Yoo et al. fabricated a localized SRP- based biosensor with an immobilized aptamer ligand for bacterial detection during the changes in the peak extinction intensity. The sensor contained a multi-spot array capping an AuNPs chip. This layer comprised a glass slide on which a thin Au coating was applied on SiNPs. The sensor was capable of detecting three bacterial species with a LOD of 30 CFU/assay (Yoo et al. 2015).\n25\n3.4. Quantum dots (QDs)\nQuantum dots (QD) are semiconductor nanoparticles with excellent electrical and optical properties in cellular imaging and analysis (Pisanic Ii et al. 2014; Reshma and Mohanan 2019). In addition, QDs have higher photo-stability, broad quantum yield and narrow emission spectra (Medintz et al. 2005; Moon et al. 2019). QDs can form conjugates with aptamers upon their excitation with a single wavelength, thus enabling the detection of pathogenic bacteria with great efficiency. Similarly, Duan et al. examined the effect of orange and green QDs at a single excitation for concurrent detection of S. typhimurium and V. parahemolyticus. A flow cytometry approach was utilized to detect the S. typhimurium and V. parahemolyticus individually or collectively after the conjugation of the aptamers with QDs. Combinations aptamer-QDs were also prepared to improve the binding capacity and sensitivity (Duan et al. 2013b). When compared to any single aptamer-QD, the combination revealed an eighteen-fold lower LOD suggesting its high efficiency in bacterial detection (Duan et al. 2013b). A list of QDs-based aptasensing studies for detection of pathogenic bacteria is provided in Table 4.\n27\nRecently, target specific optofluidic particle-sensor and aptamer-conjugated fluorescent nanoparticles were used for real-time and non-destructive detection of single bacterium. The specific binding of aptamer-conjugated fluorescent NPs to the surfaces of target E. coli was suitable for rapid and continuous counting of bacteria in an optofluidic particle-sensor. In addition, the modified aptamer did not exhibit any binding to Enterobacter aerogenes or Citrobacter freundii strains (Chung et al. 2015). Chitosan is an attractive polysaccharide for the development of aptasensors with exceptional stimulus-response properties that can be simply controlled (Elgadir et al. 2015). Hills et al.\n28\ndesigned a sensing strategy for the rapid detection of L. monocytogenes using chitosanaptamer conjugates. The bio-inspired soft material and sensing plan imitated a natural symbiotic system, where low quantities of bacteria were selectively captured from a complex matrix. To prepare this biomimetic system, a reduced graphene oxide/nanoplatinum (rGOnPt) electrodes were developed and the electrochemical behavior was investigated in the absence and presence of chitosan nanobrushes during actuation (pH-stimulated osmotic swelling). The prepared material was utilized to develop a quick test (17 min) for selective detection of L. monocytogenes at concentrations ranging from 9 CFU/mL to 107 CFU/mL with no pre-concentration and in the presence of other Gram-positive bacteria (Hills et al. 2018).\n3.6. Hybrid nano-conjugated systems\nHybrid nano-conjugated systems are used for several applications such as biosensors and responsive NP systems. Extensive efforts have already been devoted to study the possible applications of such systems for biosensors that can sensitively monitor binding events in real-time and detect a variety of processes such as pathogenic bacteria. These systems have been produced by conjugating different kinds of nanoparticles (Basso et al. 2019; Sadeghi 2012). A series of infectious pathogens were detected in a hybrid system compromising GO and nucleic acid-functionalized Ag NCs using fluorescent DNA aptamers. Red and near-infraredemitting Ag NCs were used as two types of nucleic acid-stabilized Ag NCs. There was no attachment between the nucleic acid-stabilized Ag NCs and GO. However, their conjugation with single-stranded nucleic acid resulted in the hybrid adsorption to GO which further led to the fluorescence quenching of the Ag NCs. In the reported system, fluorescence was generated through the conjugation of oligonucleotide molecules acting as probes for target genes, or as aptamer sequences, to the nucleic acid-protected nanostructures. Subsequently, desorption of the probe/nucleic-acid-stabilized Ag NCs from GO through the generation of duplex DNA constructions or aptamer–analyte complexes produced the fluorescence signal. The synthesized hybrid was utilized to obtain a multiplexed analysis of Treponema pallidum, hepatitis B and immunodeficiency virus genes (Liu et al. 2013). Hamidi-Asl et al. conjugated Ag@Au core-shell NPs and aptamers on a carbon paste electrode (CPE) for the detection of E. coli. This electrochemical aptasensing device was based on CPE altered with several NPs such as AgNPs, AuNPs, hollow silver nanospheres (HSNs), hollow gold nanospheres (HGNs), a gold–silver core shell (Au@Ag), a silver–gold\n29\ncore-shell (Ag@Au), and silver/gold alloy NPs (Ag/Au). Among mentioned nanomaterials, Ag@Au core-shell NPs were suitable for utilization in aptasensing because the core improves the physical possessions and the shell offers biocompatibility and chemical stability for the aptamer immobilization. Self-assembly of the NPs on a cysteamine film at the surface of a carbon paste electrode was followed by the immobilization of thiolated aptamers at these nanoframes. In comparison to the response achieved at an aptamer-modified planar gold electrode, the nanostructured (Ag@Au) aptasensor displayed four times better performance for the detection of target bacteria. The cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry were performed for comparison with other (core-shell) NPs. Also, the aptasensor selectivity was studied using other kinds of bacteria (Hamidi-Asl et al. 2016a). The pathogenic bacteria E. coli were also detected in a nano-featured biosensor platform. Maurer et al. reported a rapid and selective method based on AuNPs decorated CNTs that were modified with a specific surface adherent RNA molecule element. The direct synthesis of AuNPs on growing CNTs was followed by attaching a thiolated RNA. Preserving the electrical features of the nanotubes and AuNPs, the formation of an increased surface area and the improved sensitivity were potential benefits of this technique. Selective RNA sequence-coated AuNPs increased the capture of the bacteria by 189% in comparison with uncoated NPs (Figure 7) (Maurer et al. 2012).\n32\n4. Conclusions and outlook\nThe development of aptasensors based on nanomaterials hold great promise for advances in bioanalytical chemistry. However, the design of aptasensors based on nanoscaled transducers is usually challenged by mass-transfer limitations and the need for a robust fluid actuation at the nanoscale level. Although numerous nanomaterials have been developed, there is a general lack of universal protocols for their preparation, particularly at an industrial-scale. Challenges associated with their toxicities, biocompatibilities, and environmental friendliness remain daunting. On the other hand and due to their nanoscale size and potential to work reversibly, aptamer-based assays are widely-accepted for the detection of a variety of targets spanning between small molecules and whole cells. Despite these benefits, aptamer-based analyses are still less mature than immunoassays. The lack of a universal methodology for aptamer generation remains the main challenge. Another challenge can be attributed to the difficulties associated with selecting aptamers specific to particular analytes, such as small molecules. In addition, it is not easy to predict the binding of an aptamer to its target and the folded structures involved in such binding as well as its off-target binding. Thus, better selection of affinity ligands and rational design of nucleic acid probes should improve the selectivity of selected aptamers. In this context, a technique for the selection of slow off-rate modified aptamers (SOMAmers) was employed to generate apatmers specific for 813 proteins with high binding affinity and specificity. In addition, advances in computational chemistry should properly address this setback. Although aptamers represent one of the most attractive recognition elements, their potential application in complex matrices continues to be a major challenge for point-of-care systems. Chemical modifications in the aptamer molecule were proposed to improve the stability of aptamers in clinical specimens or even extend their in vivo survival and reduce their clearance. Considering the rapid progress in nanotechnology and chemical biology, we predict that the design of analytical tools based on a combination of biological nanomolecules, such as aptamers, and nanomaterials will continue to grow, offering solutions for the challenges facing the point of care diagnostics.\nConflicts of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.\n33"
