Introduction\nJo ur\nn l P\nre -p\nro of\nIn recent years with the advancement of cell based techniques the nanotechnology has\nemerged dramatically with a potential to change the medical research. With the help of scaffolds in combination with viable cell systems, tissue engineering has become a therapeutic approach for repair or regeneration of tissues [1]. Advances in stem cell research associated with nanotechnology have been influencing the tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The use of graphene as a biomaterial in nanotechnology is highly evolving due to its peculiar properties [2]. From past few years there was advancement from zero dimensional, one dimensional nanotubes to two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) nanomaterials in the field of stem cell control [3]. The use of graphene and its derivatives like graphene oxide (GO) in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering for stem cell control has got a tremendous attraction to the researchers as it is thought to be a potential next generation nanomaterial [4]. The graphene use as a biomimetic scaffold is a new field, so the research on this needs special attention for the future beneficial prospects [2]. Due to the nature of nanoscale morphology of the scaffolds made through electro spinning technique, they can be used in drug delivery. The nanoparticles have greater permeability and precise control over release time which made them to be employed in controlled drug delivery systems. The nanofibrous structures which are hollow in nature produced by coaxial electrospinning are mostly used for encapsulation of drugs [5, 6]. The use of graphene nanomaterial in stem cell proliferation is emerging from past decade with excellent outcomes [2]. The main procedure involved in tissue engineering is the use of scaffolds, viable cells and biomolecules (proteins, enzymes, growth factors etc.) followed by in vitro tissue culture and the in vivo implantation [7]. This is clearly demonstrated in Figure 1 in which graphene is used as an active biomaterial in scaffolding.\n2. Graphene\nre -p\nr of\nThe biomaterials used in tissue engineering are ceramics, synthetic and natural polymers.\nNatural biopolymers are more biologically active compared to synthetic. However, composite scaffolds show excellent activities by excluding the drawbacks of different types of biomaterials [8, 9]. Biomaterials are those which are non-viable and intended to be used to interact with biological systems [10]. The biocompatibility, biological and chemical properties of the graphene has made its use as a biomaterial [11].There are new insights for the researchers in the search of molecules having variety of biological activities that can be used as scaffolds [12]. In recent years graphene and its derivatives like graphene oxide were shown to be most effective nanomaterials in applications of biomedical sciences. It is having specific qualities like biocompatibility, stiffness, flexibility and thermal properties. This 2D nanomaterial was found to be having extensive applications in biomedicine and electronics because of its intrinsic properties [13]. The 2D honeycomb lattice of graphene is arranged by monolayer of sp2 bonded carbon atoms. Based on its physicochemical properties, large surface area and biocompatibility, graphene was thought to be utilized in stem cell based tissue engineering [14]."

      "text" : "Graphene oxide is a hydrophilic derivative of graphene. It is a single monomolecular layer of graphite and is associated with oxygen containing carboxyl, hydroxyl and epoxide groups [113]. The presence of oxide and hydroxyl groups in its structure makes it an efficient platform for the differentiation and growth of stem cells like induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonal stem cells (ESCs) [2]. When the graphene oxide and nanoparticle (positively charged silica nanoparticles) hybrid structure is cultured with human neural stem cells (hNSCs) the resulting axons from differentiating hNSCs showed a unique behaviour with enhanced growth and alignment. The oxygen functional group in graphene oxide helps in attaching to molecules or surfaces [14]."

      "text" : "Generally, graphene is exfoliated from graphite. There are many methods available to synthesize GO from graphite such as Staudenmaier, Brodie and Hummers method. In the Brodie and Staudenmaier methods, they used combination of nitric oxide and potassium chlorate for oxidation of graphene. These methods were found to be hazardous and time consuming. Whereas, in Hummers method 100 g of powdered flake graphite was mixed with 50 g of sodium nitrate and introduced in sulphuric acid in an ice bath to form a suspension. This suspension was added with 300 g of potassium permanganate and then the ice bath was removed. This mixture gets thickened gradually and produces brownish grey paste. This was washed with water and further treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide. The resulted suspension was filtered and a residue of yellow cake was formed. Further washing this yellow cake with water gives the residual graphene oxide [16, 17]. In recent years the GO was prepared from pure graphite powder by modified Hummers method. This involves use of 9:1 volume ratio of sulphuric acid (27 ml) and phosphoric acid (3 ml) which are stirred for several minutes after mixing. During this process 0.225 g of potassium Jo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\npermanganate was added. After 6 hours of stirring a dark green solution is obtained. 0.675 ml of hydrogen peroxide was added and stirred for 10 minutes to remove the excess potassium permanganate in the solution. Then it was added with 10 ml of hydrochloric acid (HCl), 30 ml deionized water (DIW) and centrifuged for 7 minutes at 5000 rpm. The residuals obtained after transferring the supernatant away was washed for 3 times with DIW and HCl. The final solution obtained was dried at 90o in oven for 24 hours to obtain the GO powder [18]. The main benefit with modified Hummer method is avoidance of sodium nitrate as oxidation with it in Hummers method can emit toxic gasses [17]. Table 1 gives the information about various studies of graphene synthesis using different methods.\nTable 1: Various synthesis methods of graphene oxide\nMethod Oxidants\nused\nAdvantages Disadvantages References\nBrodies\nStaudenmaier\nHummers\nModified Hummers Method\nImproved/ modified hummers method\nliquid oxidation based on\nKClO3, HNO3\nKClO3, H2SO4, HNO3\nKMO4, H2SO4, NaNO3\nH2SO4, KMNO4, H3PO4\nH2SO4, KMNO4, H3PO4, hydrazine\nKMnO4, NaNO3, H2SO4\nearliest method\nfaster method than Brodies (96 h), one vessel reaction with improved processing yield\nrequires less time (<2 h) and water free\navoided the use of NaNo3 decreases toxic gases, produces GO with same characteristics\nincreased amount of KMNO4 provides greater hydrophilic oxidized GO than conventional hummer method, helpful in large scale production.\nvalidated NaNO3 as unnecessary less time consuming (<2 h)\ntime consuming (3-4 days) and hazardous due to emission of toxic gases.\ntime consuming and hazardous\nemits toxic gases with NaNO3\n-\n-\n-\nBrodie, 1859 [19]\nStaudenmai er et al. 1898 [20]\nHummers et al. 1958 [16]\nZaaba et al. 2017 [18]\nDaniela et al. 2010 [21]\nFu et al. 2005 [22]\nJo ur\nna P\nre -p\nro of\nhummers method\nImproved Hummers method\nElectro chemical method\nKMnO4, H2SO4, H3BO3, (NH4)2S2O8\nH2SO4\nThe derived GO has shown high performance as supercapacitor electrodes, less acidic and high yield\nBy electrochemical intercalation in concentrated sulphuric acid, GO produced has shown features of electrochemistry support, high efficiency and yield, less time (<5 min)\ntime of 5 h, needs high temperature (up to 950 C)\n-\nYu et al. 2016 [23]\nPei et al. 2018 [24]"

      "text" : "Graphene and GO possess excellent physicochemical properties making them to gain\ninterest in the research. The 2D allotropic structure and biocompatible properties of graphene has made its availability in biological applications. Graphene has fascinating properties like high surface area of 2630 m2/g, thermal conductivity of ~5000 W/m/K, electrical conductivity and mechanical strength of ~1100Gpa (Youngâs modulus). These properties of graphene has intended to its use in biomedical and therapeutical applications [114] such as biosensors [15], treatment of cancer [115], bioimaging [116], drug delivery [117], bone repair [118] and stem cell regeneration [119] which are discussed in detail elsewhere in this review. The large and planar sp2 bonded carbon atoms, high surface area and oxygen groups in the GO makes it biocompatible and renders physiological stability and solubility with increased capability of loading drugs and genes on to it. Thus it can be used as a drug carrier. The graphene and GO shows promising results in biosensor generations, as the biosensors made by these nanomaterials have the capability of monitoring different cells (like cancer cells) and molecules (like proteins, DNA) [15]. Fluorescence quenching, electronic and controllable self assembling qualities of the graphene can make it an efficient member in the biosensing applications [120]. The use of biomaterials which are closely similar to natural stem cells niche can give best results in cell based applications [2]. The oxide and hydroxyl groups in GO induces proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells and in vitro acceleration of axonal growth in hippocampus neurons. The use of graphene and its derivatives is considered safe and supported by various studies [25-26]."

      "text" : "Bone injuries are the major issues in U.S with six million cases occurring every year which\nneeds almost one million bone graftings [28]. The disadvantages from autograft or allograft can\nJo ur\nal P\n-p ro\nof\nbe minimized by the help of tissue engineering which involves construction of bioartificial bone implant that mimics the microstructure of ECM [29-30]. The structural mimicking can be achieved by electrospinning and nanofibrous matrices [31]. Electrospinning is one of the profound techniques among the available fabricating methods of bone scaffolds because of its cost effectiveness and simple setup [32]. For the beneficial tissue in-growth, the bone scaffolds should be highly porous with large surface area [33]. In the area of bone tissue engineering, electrospinning is versatile and advanced in nature for construction of three-dimensional (3D) nanofibrous structures [34]. There are many factors involving in electrospinning like concentration, viscosity and surface tension of the solution involved [35, 36, 37]. As the tissues of the human body are having nanostructure, this led to the exploration of nanomaterials in tissue engineering [38]. Biomaterials used in bone tissue engineering should fulfil the following qualities that are biodegradable/permanent, natural/synthetic, biocompatible, osteoinductive and osteoconductive with native bone. The nanofibers morphology should be designed as similar to the ECM of native tissue [39]. Organic/ inorganic biomaterials were commonly used in bone tissue engineering [40]. The inorganic biomaterials have advantages like potential for osteoconductivity, compressive bone strength of equal to or better than bone tissue. However, in high load bearing applications they are found to be fragile in nature [41]. Among many materials available for the transplantation of stem cells, graphene was found to provide promising scaffolds which are biocompatible and helps in differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into bone cells without hampering the proliferation. Although the key objective in bone regeneration involves use of growth factors and osteogenic inducers, graphene based differentiation is comparable with that of achieved with common growth factors [42]. Nair M et al. has demonstrated that the enhanced mechanical strength of bone through scaffold made of gelatin based hydroxyapetite (GHA) matrix incorporated with GO nanoflakes. This has resulted in bone tissue of less brittleness with GHA+GO scaffolds when compared to GHA alone scaffold [43]. This implicates that GO in 3D gelatin HA scaffold is having osseopromotive property; even though there is no osteogenic providing factors in the medium. Some studies reported that there are some improved biological properties such as surface structure, cell ingrowth and compressive strength with GO coated collagen scaffold [44]. The combination of GO with bioactive molecules like dopamine will functionalize the GO and induce mineralization as those bioactive molecules mimic with the proteins in ECM [45].

      "text" : "Inspite of having high surface area, graphene has shown superiority in electrical,\nmechanical, thermal and optical qualities [67]. Graphene is extensively used in tissue engineering as an effective regenerative therapy in neurological disorders like stroke, parkinsons and alzheimers. Oxygen containing groups present on the surface of GO are helpful in making it hydrophilic and also for the attachment of cells and their growth [68]. Because of its aromatic structure, the concentration of ECM was thought to be increased through non covalent binding by GO [69]. Among graphene based nanomaterials, chemical vapour deposition (CVD) grown graphene sheets are the most potential in tissue engineering applications because of its better presentation of unique theoretical properties of graphene [70]. CVD grown graphene sheets were found to be helpful in differentiation of hNSCs directly in to neurons rather than converting to glial cells, this kind of differentiation to neurons is highly required in brain repairing [71]. The CVD grown graphene sheets as 2D templates have shown to control neural cell to cell interactions, enhanced neurite numbers and length with enhanced growth association protein-43 expression and also enhances the electrical signalling and neural performances [72, 43, & 73]. Weaver and Cui have used GO nanocomposite template in combination with polymer poly (3, 4- ethylenedioxythiophene) and showed a greater selective differentiation of NSCs. Because of the presence of carboxylic acid functional group on GO (making an advantage to GO compared to CVD grown graphene), the surface of the template provides covalent cross linking with interferonÎ³ (INFÎ³) and platelet derived growth factor which helps in selective neural differentiation [74]. When compared with CVD grown graphene sheets, GO or rGO 2D sheets were more frequently used for hNSCs differentiation in to neurons through stimulation by flash photo, pulsed laser and near infrared(NIR) [75, 76]. Elisa et al. have used 3D scaffolds of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in spinal hemisected rats and demonstrated its prominent role in injury stabilization and sealing. However, the animals without rGO implantation have shown badly structured lesion zones. Moreover, angiogenesis and increased glial fibrillary acidic proteins (GFAP) were seen in rGO scaffolds implanted rats. GFAP are the markers for astrocytes which are involved in mediating regenerative responses in injured rats. Inflammatory response is attenuated in rGO animal group by decreasing ED1cells (biomarkers of macrophages). These results have given insights into the effects of graphene oxide in angiogenesis, neural regeneration and in immunomodulation [27]. Although, the 2D scaffolds have shown interesting results in differentiation of cells, 3D scaffolds with appropriate topographies are highly desired in clinical applications for successful implementation of stem cells [77]. Fabrication of 3D scaffolds can be done by CVD method or chemical exfoliation method. Interconnected neural network with components like neurons and glial cells can be exceptionally generated by 3D GO scaffolds [78]. Nayak et al. has observed a significant difference in cell differentiation between graphene and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Even though they have similar morphologies, they exhibit some structural changes on micrometer scale with many wrinkles and ripples on CVD grown graphene which Jo ur na l P r -p r f\nmakes its surface effective for protein adhesion and cell differentiation when compared to HOPG [42].\nGraphene can act as an electron acceptor. Thus the electric fields produced by graphene\ncan open the calcium channels of cells that attached on the graphene surface which help in neuronal differentiation by increasing calcium ion concentration [71]. A study by Aniruddh Solanki et al. has demonstrated an enhanced neuronal differentiation and axonal alignment from hNSCs among GO coated substrates. There was no alignment of axons observed on silica nanoparticle monolayers. Presence of GO can be helpful in neuronal differentiation and also in axonal alignment [14]. Dominguez-Bajo et al. has evaluated the use of rGO scaffolds in neural repair of chronic cervical hemisected rats. The 3D porous foams of graphene implanted after 4 months of spinal cord injury appeared as populated with neurites and fully vascularized after implantation, moreover the scaffold implanted rats showed reduced perilesional damage when compared with non implanted rats and also there was no toxicity observed in organs or alteration of behaviour with the rGO implants. This demonstrates the rGO pivotal feature of regenerative ability and use in neural repair [79].

      "text" : "Graphene has tremendous electrochemical and electro behavioural properties which\ninfluence their application in biosensors [51]. Sayed H et al. has designed a label free impedimetric biosensor by using porous graphene nanosheets for the purpose of detecting cardiac marker troponin-I helpful in diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Further, the device was tested in real population at clinics and they found good and significant results rather than enzyme linked\nJ ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\nfluorescent assay (ELFA). These findings open new insights in development of reliable electrochemical biosensors [52]. Wakas S et al. used graphene in development of biosensor for detection of fibrinogen and found satisfactory results. In this study, graphene was attached to fibrinogen specific antibodies. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) was used to confirm the antibodies on graphene scaffold. This device senses fibrinogen in whole blood sample, human serum and this biosensor can be helpful in patients with trauma induced coagulopathy in improving clinical management of such patients [53]. Graphene oxide acts as a biosensor in detection of xanthine in sea food, especially in fish. As the non protein nitrogen components in the sea food enhances bacterial growth and easy spoilage during storage there is a need of analytical devices which are cost effective for quality testing of food [54]. Boryana B et al. used hybrid nanomaterials like reduced GO in combination with carboxymethylcellulose for the development of enzyme electrochemical biosensors. It was used for quantifying xanthine in fish and found successfull. This device was based on the amperometric detection of enzyme. Fish freshness was estimated by xanthine and hypoxanthine which act as biochemical markers. Catalytic conversion of xanthine and hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidase is the main principle involved in this device [55]. Recent advances in biosciences have led to the use of nanomaterials in advanced DNA sensors for the detection of genetic disorders. Graphene based field effect transistor (G-FET) in which the surface of graphene was functionalised with ssDNA was used as electronic DNA biosensors. Biomolecular binding events are observed by selective binding of ssDNA probe to the target DNA resulting in electrical conductivity change [56]. The use of GO in optical DNA biosensors is based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect. Because of the photoluminescence properties of GO, it can act both as FRET donor or acceptor [57]. Liu et al. have proposed a biosensor using Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and GO. The AuNPs labelled with cDNA has formed hybridization with probe on GO surface and it lead to decreased fluorescence emission of almost 95% from GO, due to energy transfer between GO sheets and AuNPs. This suggest the use of GO in selective detection of DNA- DNA hybridization [58]. Electrochemistry is an important analysis system for DNA sensing with main principle involved in it is specific hybridization between target DNA and probe DNA which induces change in electrochemical signals. Graphene plays an excellent role in electrochemical DNA biosensing [57]. A study conducted by Pumera et al. has demonstrated the use of graphene modified electrode in genosensing. Immobilization of hairpin DNA (hpDNA) on the sensor surface has increased the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the modified electrode. A significant decrease in Rct was observed after hybridization with wild type target which was due to partial release of hpDNA probes from the surface of electrode [59]."

      "text" : "During past few years, there were unparalleled advancements in cancer discovery with the\nhelp of nanodiagnostics [60]. Correlation of pathological symptoms and morphological features of organs is enabled by bioimaging and thus helps in finding biomarkers as well as diagnosis of various diseases [61]. The optical properties of graphene quantum dots (GQD) and nanographene helps in access into cancer cells. Fan Z et al. have demonstrated the use of boron doped GQDs in\nJo ur\nal Pr\nepr\no f\ndetection of biomarkers through cellular imaging. Rich fluorescence is observed by doping of boron on GQD [62]. A similar study was conducted by Lui et al. using propidium iodide (PI)-GO for staining DNA/RNA of human breast cancer cells MCF-7. These findings have revealed the importance of GO in delivery of PI for staining of cells, as it was found that PI alone cannot pass through cellular membrane [63]. Although graphene can enter both normal and cancerous cells, it is necessary for studies to be conducted in aiming its use in targeted in vivo cancer diagnosis [60]. Sun X et al. have synthesized PEGylated nano graphene oxide (NGO) which can be applied as in vitro and in vivo imaging. In this study, B cell specific antibody Rituxan (anti- CD20) was conjugated with PEGlyated NGO. This combination (NGO-PEG-anti-CD20) helps in specific recognition of B cell lymphomas as depicted in figure 2 [64]. With the advances in targeted cancer cell imaging, the possibilities to in vivo imaging have come in to light. In addition, Hwang et al. has demonstrated the fluorescence imaging of cancer using GO-PEG-folic acid (FA) as intravenous injection. Near IR luminescence was clearly visualized from the internalized GO complex with a high tumor to background ratio after 24 hours post injection. This makes the GOPEG-FA complex a very good theranostatic nanomaterial and encourages its use in clinical setting [65]. In recent years, compared to traditional fluorescent materials the doping fluorescent carbon dots (DFCDs) have become a great interest. The heteroatoms of DFCDs can help in tuning intrinsic properties of GQDs and carbon quantum dots (CQDs) [66].\n+\n(a) (b) (c)\nFigure .2 Schematic representation of (a) PEGylated nano grapheneoxide; (b) anti-\nCD20 antibody; (c) selective binding of NGO-PEG- anti CD20 with B cell lymphoma cell."

Graphene is also used in targeted delivery of anticancer drugs. Graphene oxide in addition with sulphonic acid group and covalent binding of folic acid acts as a nanocarrier for doxorubicin and camptothecin. This has demonstrated the specific targeting of cancer cells in vitro and significantly reducing their viability [89]. An in vivo study by Yang et al. involving PEGylated nano graphene sheets injection to mouse resulted in graphene sheets efficiency in tumor passive targeting without any toxicity noted.

Graphene is used as a photothermal agent and as targeted chemotherapy agent and supported by studies summarized in Table 4.\nTable 4: Applications of graphene nanomaterials in cancer\nMaterial Cells Advantages References\nGlucose reduced GO suspension\nPEGylated nano graphene sheets\nPEGlyalted rGO sheets\nLNCaP Prostate\nin vivo tumor models of mice\nU87MG cancer cells\nshowed excellent in vitro photothermal therapy and biocompatibility compared to hydrazine reduced GO.\nhigh uptake (passive) of GO-PEG by tumors, resulting effective phothermal (NIR) ablation of tumors.\nshowed high in vitro photo ablation, low cost compared to other NIR photothermal agents and with significant loading of doxorubicin on rGO\nAkhavan et al. 2012 [91]\nYang et al. 2010 [92]\nJoshua et al. 2011 [93]\nJo ur\nna\nl P\nre -p\nro of\nnanoGO+PEG+ Doxorubicin\nnanoG0+folic acid Doxorubicin (DOX) + Polyvinylpyrrolidone\nPEG+nanoGO+SN38 (camptothecin analogue)\nin vivo and in vitro tumors\nin vitro\nHCT-116 (human colon cancer cell line)\nshowed synergistic effects by combined chemotherapy and photothermal therapy with high therapeutic efficacy.\nshowed 100% loading ratio of DOX and effective as targeted chemophotothermal therapy\nshowed high efficacy than irinotecan (CPT-11) and excellent water solubility with potency of cancer cell killing\nZhang et al. 2011 [94]\nQin et al. 2013 [95]\nLiu et al. 2008 [96]"

      "text" : "Although graphene has excellent properties to be a scaffold, it acts as impermeable barrier\nbetween cells and obstacle for interchange of ions between them. This may lead to problems in neuronal networks by incomplete formation of synapses. Therefore, there is a need of degradation of graphene scaffolds after desired cell proliferation. This can be done by flash photo stimulation with the help of metal oxide photocatalyst. Recent studies suggested CVD grown nanomesh scaffolds can be degraded by NIR laser irradiation. Ascorbic acid act as hole-scavengers in NIR method of degradation, whereas this is absent in the flash photo stimulation. However, there are no systematic reports in literature so far regarding the biodegradability of graphene scaffolds [97]. Because of its carbon based structure graphene is thought to provide biocompatible surface which is helpful for cell proliferation and differentiation. Nevertheless, graphene has its own toxicity which may be due to smaller size and high concentrations among nanoplates and nanoribbons of graphene [98]. The possible mechanisms for graphene toxicity can be due to physical damage to membrane of cells by contact of sharp edged graphene, aggregated graphene sheet wrapping the cells in a suspension and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation [99, 100]. It is clear that in vitro studies donât show these effects, though these mechanisms can be involved in probable toxicities by graphene in the body [101]. Graphene based nanomaterials when used in humans, they get degraded into holey sheets and aromatic hydrocarbons and moreover it was found that the ability of killing tumor cells and efficiency of drug delivery was exhibited by biotransformed nanomaterials. In contrast, the pristine graphene family nanomaterials were thought to be involved in disturbances of cellular metabolic pathways and also in secondary structural damage to proteins [102]. Although it was shown that graphene is excreted through urine, there is a special consideration in which graphene uptake by different organs from graphene sheets in the body [103]. Furthermore it was supported by a study of Akhavan et al. in which male mice was injected with nanoscale-GO (NGO). They observed the uptake of graphene in to testis which affects the Jo ur na l P r -p\nro of\nviability and motility of the spermatozoa by remarkable DNA fragmentations. Moreover, when the semen of these mice (contains ROS and damaged spermatozoa) was transferred into female mice has resulted in decreased fertility, gestation abilities and disturbed hormone secretion [104]. However, a study by Yang et al. reported that there were no observed toxicities in liver and kidney of mice when it was treated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) functionalized graphene over three months [105]. There are only few in vivo studies available on toxicity and biodistribution of graphene. Wang et al. have observed chronic toxicity in lungs, kidneys, spleen and also granuloma formation among the mice treated with high dose (0.4mg) of graphene (intravenous). These toxicity effects were not observed among low dose injected mice (0.1, 0.25 mg). Moreover, at higher doses the graphene was not filtered by the kidneys [106]. In another study by Dutch et al. the graphene oxide was directly administered in to lungs of mice which resulted in ROS generation and increased mitochondrial respiration [107]. Yang et al. have used polyethylene glycol coated graphene oxide nanomaterials for intravenous administration in mice. The results of this study have shown initial accumulation of graphene in liver and spleen. There was no observed toxicity at a dose of 20mg/kg with complete clearance after 3 months [108]. Graphene also shows toxicity to bacteria. Akhavan et al. and Liu et al. have studied the toxic effects of graphene and its components on the E.coli and S. Aureus strains. The antibacterial activity of graphene compounds was found to be due to disruption of cell membrane of bacteria by direct contact with graphene nanosheets [109, 110]. In contrast, couple of studies have reported lack of graphene toxicity against bacteria with absence of inhibiting bacterial growth [111].\nGraphene oxide has shown dose dependent cytotoxicity on human embryonic kidney cells\n(HEK293). The cytotoxicity was found to be due to generation of ROS, leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and decrease in reduced glutathione levels which collectively induce oxidative stress. These in turn damages the DNA, decreases the ATP synthesis and membrane potential of mitochondria [121]. In order to use graphene nanoparticles in tissue engineering and clinical applications, more studies should be conducted for evaluation of the toxicities (involving geno-toxicity) to support the future applications and minimizing the risks of graphene [112]."

      "heading" : "5. Conclusion",
      "text" : "Graphene has shown to be a fabulous nanomaterial in tissue engineering. It has many\npeculiar properties rather than other nanomaterials used in regenerative medicine. Graphene and its components are extensively investigated in many biological applications in vivo and in vitro and obtained positive and interesting results. As it is thought to be a next generation nanomaterial, its use as 3D scaffolds in humans should be extensively encouraged in near future to avoid the graft rejections which are the main risks observed in patients. The advancements in cell based technologies can induce dramatical changes in medical research with the help of nanotechnology. There is a limited literature associated with graphene interactions with living systems. Future studies of researchers should focus on possible interactions between graphene materials and biological systems through in vitro and in vivo studies to avoid toxicity. When graphene and its components are thought to be used in tissue engineering its biocompatibility must be considered\nJ ur\nn l P\nre -p\nro f\nas a factor because of its dose dependent toxicity. The in vivo toxicity in biomedical applications of graphene family materials is still a big challenge. The use of graphene or GO in the neuronal stem cells differentiation has shown excellent results. The extensive research in graphene nanotechnology can lead to a simple and cost effective treatment option for neurodegenerative disorders, bone and tissue replacements, stem cell technology, targeted drug delivery and as anticancer therapy. Major challenges of using GO in biosensors are a) tuning the electronic properties of GO by modification of originally prepared GO and b) in the development of integration techniques of GO in practical devices with low cost, high sensitivity reliability and selectivity. The major obstacles in the use of GO in labelling and biodetection are involved with its broad emission band and weak fluorescence intensity. However, the GO based biosensors have distinct advantages of facile functionalization, safety and biocompatibility over II-IV QDs. To overcome these challenges in future days more efforts should be made in preparation of GQDs with improved fluorescence quantum yield by control over size and size distribution, their functionalization and surface defects. The authors also suggest the researchers for studies on graphene family nanomaterials in various other biomedical applications which can have clinical impact and thus encouraging the pharmaceutical industries in the manufacturing of graphene based nanomaterials. Use of graphene materials in biosensors for cost effective and quick analysis of diseases should be encouraged for the beneficial use in patients.\nSource of support: Nil\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest: The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\nEthical statement: Ethical approval and consent to participate is not applicable to this article as no data were generated or analyzed during the current study.\nAcknowledgement: The authors express sincere thanks to Gitam Institute of Pharmacy for timely support in accomplishment of this study.\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro"

In this review, we highlighted the recent applications and challenges of graphene and its derivatives in stem cell proliferation, bone tissue engineering, neuronal proliferation and in biosensors. Graphene or graphene oxide has shown interesting results in angiogenesis, neuronal regeneration and immunomodulation in various in vitro and in vivo studies. Graphene based materials have a potential to be emerging as next generation nanomaterials. We discussed about the conventional procedures and related challenges in synthesis of graphene oxide. This review aims in summarizing the recent progresses of various graphene based nanomaterials and their hybrids in biomedical applications. Graphene as two dimensional, three dimensional and hybrids are attracting interest in biosensing and bioimaging. However, besides the fascinating properties of graphene, its biocompatibility and biodegradability related toxicities are still a question to researchers. Graphene nanomaterials use in various tissue scaffolds should be taken as an active area of interest by the researchers in near future. This review also enlisted the recent advancements of graphene as anticancer therapy and targeted drug delivery system. We hope the summary of this review inspires the researchers to conduct more studies on graphene based applications and its possible toxicities in humans, so that it can be implemented as cost effective and safe treatment to many pathological conditions.",
