      "text" : "Mineral insulating oil, which is conventionally divided in aliphatic, naphthenic and aromatic hydrocarbons, is widely used in transformers, circuit breakers and other electrical equipment. However, there is usually still a small amount of sulfur containing compounds present, which are obtained from the refining technique or that have been added as antioxidants, which could cause the corrosion of copper coils within the transformers [1–9]. Dibenzyl disulfide (DBDS) is one of the most abundant and representative of these sulfur species. Thus, the development of new adsorbents to improve the DBDS selective removal is of paramount importance. In this regard, various types of adsorbents, such as, metal oxides, clays, activated carbon and zeolites have been used as adsorbents for organic compounds [10–13]. Among them, cation-exchanged zeolites are attractive for this application due to their thermal stability, facility to be separated from the reaction products, ability to be regenerated, high surface area, size-selective adsorption property and capacity to include a large variety of cationic sites. These materials have also been evaluated as adsorbents for sulfur compounds [11–13]. Particularly, ion exchanged faujasites (type Y zeolite) have proven to be efficient adsorbents for dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) [14], hydrogen sulfide (H2S) [15–18], tetrahydrothiophene (THT) and t-butyl mercaptan (TBM) [19,20]. In the same vein, systems using Ag+, Cu2+ and Ce3+ exchanged Y zeolites have been employed for adsorption of thiophenes from organic liquid medium [21]. Moreover,\nNanomaterials 2019, 9, 715; doi:10.3390/nano9050715 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2019, 9, 715 2 of 10\nadsorbent systems based on Cu-Y, Ag-Y and Ce-Y have been used for DBDS removal from insulating oil with good performance [1]. Indeed, AgY was able to remove 76% of DBDS, 80% of CeY and 97% of CuY. However, adsorption enthalpies were not measured, and these results deserve to be explained at a molecular level. Therefore, for the sake of this study the faujasite zeolite was retained to examine the DBDS adsorption. The adsorption efficiency of the cation exchanged zeolites had been attributed to an adsorption mechanism involving π complexation of cations in zeolites with sulfides after ion exchange, but some questions have not been answered yet, such as the structural effect of the adsorbent (type of zeolite), the amount and type of metal exchanged on the zeolite. As the time required to perform cationic exchange can be very long, here we propose to undertake a theoretical screening of all monovalent cations that can be experimentally incorporated in the Y zeolite. Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the most effective tools to elucidate adsorption processes at molecular level, and is conveniently employed to investigate such processes in various cation-exchanged zeolites [22–29]. Therefore, in the present work a systematic DFT investigation will be performed in order to evaluate the use of metal-exchanged faujasites as adsorbents of dibenzyl disulfide (DBDS). The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the computational details. In Section 3, the DBDS properties are analyzed, first in gas phase and then adsorbed in NaY, and finally, the interaction is studied in different exchanged zeolites LiY, NaY, KY, CsY, Cu(I)Y and Ag(I)Y. In Section 4, the main conclusions are summarized."

      "heading" : "2. Methodology",
      "text" : "In this study, density functional theory was used applying the augmented plane wave method (PAW) [30] to describe the electron-ion interactions with a cut-off energy of 450 eV. The functional of Perdew Burke Ernzerhof (PBE) [31] was employed, and the Kohn–Sham equations were solved self-consistently until the energy difference of the cycles is less than 10−6 eV. The atomic positions were fully optimized until all forces were smaller than 0.01 eV/Å per atom. Due to the large size of the unit cell, all computations were performed only at the Γ-point. The computations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [32]. To accurately describe the adsorption process of DBDS molecule in the zeolite, van der Waals (vdW) interactions, which are not included in the PBE functional were taken into account [23,28,33,34] using two correction schemes, D2 and TS/HI, with each method representing a different degree of complexity in the correction formulation. In the D2 correction of Grimme [35–37] the vdW interactions are described as an atom-pairwise correction and the C6 coefficients are defined for each atomic species irrespective of the system. On the other hand, in the Tkatchenko–Scheffler scheme with iterative Hirshfeld partitioning (TS/HI) [38–40], the C6 coefficients are dependent on the electron density and the ionic character of the system. Both methods were recently implemented in VASP code [37,39,40]. Once the total energy of the different systems has been computed with either of the two dispersion correction schemes, the interaction energies of DBDS over cation-exchanged FAU at 0 K are obtained using Equation (1) below.\n∆Eint = EFAU−X − EFAU − EX , (1)\nwhere\n- EFAU-X: the energy of the system containing faujasite with DBDS; - EFAU: the energy of the faujasite alone; - EX: the energy of the isolated DBDS in gaseous phase.\nIn a similar fashion, the contribution of dispersion forces ∆Edisp to the interaction energy was computed as:\n∆Edisp = Edisp FAU−X − Edisp FAU − Edisp X . (2)\nNanomaterials 2019, 9, 715 3 of 10\nFinally, a Noncovalent Interactions Analysis (NCI), as proposed by Yang and coworkers, was conducted by using the NCI code [41,42] to describe more precisely the different types of noncovalent interactions such as π-cation. The suitability of this methodology to explain host-guest interactions in metal-containing systems has been reported previously [42,43]. The faujasite is a three dimensional network belonging to the family of large pore zeolites. Its framework is composed of sodalite cages also named β cages with diameter of 6.6 Å connected to supercages also named α cages and having a diameter of 12.4 Å. These two units are interconnected by hexagonal prisms whose opening is of 2.3 Å (D6R). These supercages are linked together by a 12MR ring with diameter of 7.4 Å, forming the porous accessible network. The siliceous structure of faujasite crystallizes within the Fd3m symmetry space group [44]. The lattice parameters of the standard cubic cell (576 atoms, Si192O384) are: a = b = c = 25.028 Å [45,46]. In the present study, in order to reduce the computational cost, we consider the primitive rhombohedral cell containing 144 atoms (Figure 1). The primitive cell of faujasite contains two supercages and eight hexagonal windows connecting the sodalite with the supercage. In this work, we exchange 14 Si by Al atom inside this primitive cell (see Figure 1), resulting in a Si/Al ratio of 2.43 which corresponds to Y zeolite [47]. Therefore, the molecular formulas of the investigated cells are M14Al14Si34O96, with M = Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, Cu+ or Ag+. As the cation volumes influence the cell parameters, we carried out a full relaxation of the cells for each system investigated at the PBE+D2 level of theory.\nNanomaterials 2019, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 10\nFinally, a Noncovalent Interactions Analysis (NCI), as proposed by Yang and coworkers, was conducted by usi g the NCI code [41,42] to describe more recisely the different types of non valent interactio s such as π-cation.

The second eigenvalue of the electronic density Hessian (λ2) enables us to determine the nature of such interactions; hence, intense stabilizing forces are characterized by λ2 < 0, steric repulsion by λ2 > 0, and weak interactions by λ2 ≈ 0. These λ2 values are represented by using a color scale. The NCI results for the conformer I of DBDS embedded in NaY and CuY systems are presented in Figure 3. In the DBDS-NaY structure an isosurface is clearly observed between one DBDS aromatic ring and a Na+ ion, revealing an efficient cation-π interaction in this case. Conversely, the absence of this isosurface in the analog DBDS-CuY, along with a shorter distance between the second aromatic ring and a Cu+ (2.350 Å) in comparison to DBDS-NaY (3.815 Å) suggest that a covalent character interaction is the main factor governing the DBDS inclusion in CuY, prior to the rise of noncovalent forces. Remarkably, neither of the two systems exhibits an isosurface between the cation and sulphur, suggesting a negligible interaction between the disulfide bridge and the Na+/Cu+ ions.

In the case of the conformer II, an elongation of the S-S bond is observed for all cations. With regard to the variation of the S-S bond after adsorption of the conformer III, one can notice a lengthening of the S-S bond with all the cations, which is more pronounced in NaY. Regarding the conformer IV, the least stable of the four conformers studied, one can observe a shortening of the S-S bond for all cations, making them good candidates for DBDS removal. We highlight the fact that Li+ and Cu+ exchanged zeolites give the highest interaction energies with values of −170.0 and −275.1 kJ mol−1, respectively. As the proportion of each conformer cannot be controlled experimentally, especially under the conditions of electric transformers, we have to select a Y zeolite formulation where the S-S bond activation would be the most limited as possible. According to this criterion, NaY has to be rejected because it could decompose the conformers II and III quite easily, while LiY appears as an ideal candidate. Hence, CsY, AgY and CuY can be selected as a compromise between high interaction energies and limited S-S bond activation. These recommendations are partially supported or in agreement with the experimental results obtained by Wan et al. [1], who found that CuY was an efficient material to remove DBDS (97% of removal after 2 h), followed by AgY (76%). Unfortunately, we do not have other elements of comparison as adsorption enthalpies were not measured in this study [1]."

      "text" : "The adsorption of DBDS on MY zeolites (with M = Li, Na, K, Cs, Cu or Ag) was investigated using periodic DFT including dispersion corrections in order to propose an efficient DBDS adsorbent for its removal from mineral insulating oils. From the different MY structures herein studied, it was clear that DBDS adsorbs via its phenyl moieties instead of forming a sulfur bond. Among the five conformers, conformer I is recognized as the most stable one followed by conformers II, III and IV that are less stable however equivalent, while conformer V is the least stable and was not considered in this study. The interaction energies of the four considered conformers range from −170 to −275 kJ mol−1 in the cationic-exchanged Y zeolites investigated in the present work. In the case of DBDS-CuY, the comparative NCI analysis with the analog DBDS-NaY, and the shorter distance between the DBDS phenyl group and a Cu(I) belonging the supercage, suggest a covalent character interaction, explaining the high calculated adsorption energies found for this system. Remarkably, neither DBDS-NaY nor DBDS-CuY exhibit NCI isosurfaces between the cation and sulphur, suggesting a negligible interaction between them. In general, one can conclude that the adsorption complex (DBDS/MY) displays an advantageous geometry in order to avoid copper sulfide formation. Moreover, CsY, AgY and CuY can be selected as a compromise between high interaction energies and limited S-S bond activation, and are predicted to be optimal adsorbents for molecular DBDS, avoiding the formations of dissociated species. In the future we plan to extend our study on other zeolites and MOFs, still on the DBDS molecule, but also its sub-species and other sulfated species that may be present in the oil, such as C6H5-CH2-SH and SH2 in the frame of ab initio molecular dynamics.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/9/5/715/s1, Figure S1.

In order to prevent these undesirable processes, MY zeolites (with M = Li, Na, K, Cs, Cu or Ag) are proposed to adsorb molecularly DBDS. In this study, different MY zeolites are investigated at the DFT+D level in order to assess their ability in DBDS adsorption. It was found that CsY, AgY and CuY exhibit the best compromise between high interaction energies and limited S-S bond activation, thus emerging as optimal adsorbents for DBDS.",
