Inspired by the pinecone-shaped structure, a novel reduced-graphene oxide (rGO)/Ni composite coating with pinecone-like micro/nanostructures was fabricated successfully on a stainless steel substrate using a simple electrodeposition method combining Ni pre-deposition and an elevated current assistant approach. The results show that the coating is of self-cleaning and superhydrophicity with a water contact angle (CA) of 162.7 0.8 and a sliding angle (SA) of 2.5 1.0 . Importantly, the coating still maintains the excellent self-cleaning and superhydrophicity, water CA of 155.8 1.2 and SA of 5.9 1.2 , even after 100-cycle mechanical abrasion. Meanwhile, the coating also exhibits good anticorrosion performance in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, with 99.98% inhibition efficiency. The simple fabrication method may provide a cost-effective way to prepare mechanically durable, anticorrosive, self-cleaning and superhydrophobic coatings on metal substrates."

      "text" : "Superhydrophobic surfaces with water contact angles (CA)> 150 , and sliding angles (SA)< 10 have attracted more and more attention due to their numerous potential applications including anti-icing [1,2], self-cleaning [3–5], oil-water separation [6], anticorrosion [7] and drag reduction [8]. Inspired by the “lotus effect”, artificial superhydrophobic materials have been successfully prepared with enough surface roughness and low surface energy. Water droplets could become nearly spherical shapes due to the existence of surface tension and repulsive force, collecting and removing the contaminants when they bounce and roll off the superhydrophobic surfaces. However, the most troubling issue of the as-fabricated superhydrophobic surfaces is the adhesion to the substrates and the durability of the micro/nanostructures [9–12].\nTo date, various efforts have been made to fabricate bio-inspired superhydrophobic surfaces, such as sol-gel [13], 3D printing [14–16], chemical etching [17], chemical vapor deposition [18], electro-spinning [19] and self-assembly [20,21]. Most of these methods are complex and time-consuming, limiting their large-scale industrial applications. In contrast, electrodeposition [22–28] is a simple, controllable, and economical method. Esmailzadeh et al. [29] reported that a thin superhydrophobic nickel layer with water CA of 155 and roughness (Ra) of\nng).\nion and hosting by Elsevier B.V. o\nrication of superhydrophobic r o Materials Science , https://d\n93 nm 8 nm was electrodeposited on a copper substrate, consisting of micro-cones deposited at a low current density (CD) and nano-cones deposited on the surfaces of the micro-cones after the CD was enhanced. Besides, to further increase surface roughness of the coatings [30], various additives have been selected and mixed in the electrolyte as an assistant to deposit hierarchical micro/nanostructures on surfaces [31–35]. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a suitable additive candidate to fabricate superhydrophobic materials [36–39] not only due to the hydrophobicity itself but to its large specific surface area, abrasion resistance and excellent conductivity. Ding et al. [37] have constructed a superhydrophobic rGO/nickel composite coating on a mild steel substrate. Unfortunately, the substrate could not be covered completely by the rGO/nickel composite particles though the water CA achieved 160.4 1.5 after the electrodeposition process at a lower constant CD. Furthermore, biological poison fluorine-based materials [6,8,10], such as fluoroalkylsilane (FAS), are utilized to achieve a low-energy surface in many materials, which leads to environmental pollution. Therefore, environmentally friendly, cost-effective stearic acid (STA) [34] or myristic acid [22] with similar effects have been applied to improve the superhydrophobicity of coating.\nIn this paper, a simple, environmentally friendly and cost-effective method combining Ni pre-deposition (NPD) and an elevated current\nn behalf of KeAi. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license\neduced-graphene oxide/nickel coating with mechanical durability, selfoi.org/10.1016/j.nanoms.2019.05.001\nassistant (ECA) electrodeposition approach was designed to fabricate a rough enough surface with an abrasion resistant pinecone-inspired hierarchical micro/nano structures. After the NPD approach, the stainless steel (SS) substrate was covered completely by a fresh and thin nickel layer, followed by a deposition of stacked rGO/Ni micro/nanoparticles on the NPD layer to enhance the surface roughness through a lower CD, and then an ECA process was employed to construct a pinecone-like hierarchical micro/nano rGO/Ni composite surface. At last, STA was selected to modify the as-deposited composite coating further to improve the superhydrophobicity. The formation mechanism of the special pinecone-like hierarchical micro/nanostructure was investigated, and mechanical stability, self-cleaning and anticorrosion performance of the as-fabricated samples were characterized and evaluated."

The asfabricated coating was faced down to a 400-grit SiC sandpaper, and then a 100 g weight was placed on the back of the sample for detecting mechanical stability of the coating and counting the abrasion cycles [40]. The superhydrophobic surface, facing to the sandpaper, was first moved for 10 cm to the right along the ruler at a constant speed, and then rotated by 90 and moved to the left along the ruler for 10 cm. This process was defined as one abrasion cycle. Corrosion resistance of the coatings was examined by using an electrochemical workstation (Autolab M204, Metrohm). A three-electrode cell with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference, a platinum electrode as the counter, and the samples with exposed area of 1 cm2 as the working electrode was immersed in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution (pH~5.9) for 30min to obtain a stable open circuit potential.

It is clear that a dense composite coating with thickness of ~200 μm has formed on the Ni pre-deposited SS substrate (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1c presents the rGO/Ni composite coating deposited layer by layer after 5min deposition at the lower constant CD of 20mA cm 2. Micron-sized rGO sheets (see the inset in Fig. 1c) provided more nucleation sites for the subsequent nickel deposition and generated more protrusions on the fresh NPD surface. As time went by, these rGO sheets were buried gradually by new deposited nickel and could be hardly\nobserved. After 10min deposition, the stacked rGO/Ni composite micro/ nanoparticles formed, and nickel needles with an average diameter of ~300 nm distributed homogeneously on both the as-deposited rGO sheet surfaces and the bare areas without rGO sheets to form a rough surface of the GN10 sample, as shown in Fig. 1d. Compared with that of Sample GN10, a GNE coating shown in Fig. 1e reveals a pinecone-like hierarchical micro/nano stacking morphology, fabricated through the ECA approach. With increasing CD, most of the nickel crystals were passivated due to the enhancement of effect of cathodic polarization [29,41]. Then pinecone-like sedimentary rGO/Ni composite coating was formed (Fig. 1e) and its zoomed in image was shown in Fig. 1f.\nThree-dimensional LSCM images of GN10 and GNE coatings are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The GNE coating with Ra¼ 67.3 1.0 μm (Fig. 2b) is much rougher than the GN10 one (Ra ¼ 44.8 7.1 μm, as shown in Fig. 2a) due to the special stacking morphology, pinecone-like hierarchical micro/nanostructures."

Elements of Ni, O and C are clearly observed in the XPS spectra (Fig. 3a), and the atomic percentage of each element is 70.61 C%, 4.27 O%, and 5.12 Ni%, respectively. The Ni 2p XPS spectrum shown in Fig. 3b was deconvoluted into five peaks at 852.2 eV, 853.9 eV, 855.6 eV, 856.6 eV, and 861.0 eV. The peak developed at the binding energy 852.2 eV is ascribed to Ni0, metallic Ni [42,43], whereas features appear at 855.6 eV and 856.6 eV are ascribed to NiOOH (Ni3þ states), and Ni(OH)2, respectively [43,44]. Peaks at 853.9 eV and 861.0 eV correspond to NiO [43]. It was inevitable that a little bit Ni would transform into oxidation states in an open experiment environment [45]. Fig. 3c depicts the O 1s spectrum that was deconvoluted clearly into five peaks at 529.5 eV, 530.5 eV, 531.5 eV, 532.3 eV and 533.8 eV, respectively. The peak at 529.5 eV is attributed to O2 (Ni–O) [46]. The peaks at 530.5 eV and 531.5 eV are resulted from\nthe Ni3þ species (NiOOH) [47] and Ni2þ species (Ni(OH)2) [48,49], respectively. The peaks at 532.3 eV and 533.8 eV correspond to O2 ions in carboxylate (–COO–) group [50] and H2O [46]. In Fig. 3d, C 1s deconvolution spectrum exhibits four different peaks centered at 284.6 eV, 285.2 eV, 286.9 eV and 288.5 eV, corresponding to C–C/C–C (rGO/STA), C–H, C–O (rGO), and O–C–O (STA) groups [51,52], respectively. This indicates that rGO and a long-chain aliphatic group including –COO– bond are formed in the rGO/Ni composite coating because –OH groups (NiO–OH/Ni–OH) on nickel surfaces have reacted with –COOH groups of STA and formed a stable covalent bond compound, which further confirms a successful STA modification."

After 10min deposition at lower CD of 20mA cm 2, the water CA and SA of the S-GN10 sample are 158.3 1.0 and 4.6 1.1 , respectively. Through the ECA process, the S-GNE coating with pinecone-like hierarchical micro/nanostructures reached CA of 162.7 0.8 , and the SA decreased down to 2.5 1.0 . It was the composite micro/nanostructure formed by Ni pinecones located at the surfaces of the rGO sheets, which provided sufficient “air pockets”, thus enabled water droplets to bounce and roll off immediately. This is consistent with Cassie-Baxter model [53] expressed by,\ncosθr ¼ f1cosθ0 þ f2 (1)\nwhere θr and θ0 are the CAs of the S-GNE and NPD (102.4 1.3 , as shown in Fig. 4a) samples, respectively; f1 and f2 (f1þf2¼ 1) represent the area fraction of the solid component and the air in contact with water, respectively. Therefore, f1 is 5.97% for the S-GNE coating, which means 94.03% area of the coating was filled with air. The trapped air may serve as air cushions, providing a resistance to the penetration of water droplets to the S-GNE coating [54]."

Fig. 5b presents an SEM image of the S-GNE coating surface subjected to 100-cycle mechanical abrasion, in which almost undamaged rGO/Ni composite particles can still be observed. In comparison, see Fig. 5a, the superhydrophobic PDMS/silica coating [55] and CNC/silica composite coating [56] had already lost their superhydrophobicity after ~45 and 51-cycle mechanical abrasion, respectively, and the mesh/Cu/PDMS films [57] lost after 100-cycle abrasion. Although the coatings of PDMS/silica [58], FAS-TiO2/Zn [59], and rGO/Ni [37] still maintained superhydrophobicity, they only subjected to 20, 50, and 60-cycle mechanical abrasion, respectively. The results indicate that the present S-GNE coatings with rough enough and stabilized pinecone-like micro/nanostructure have the better resistance to repeatedly mechanical abrasion, maintaining excellent superhydrophobicity after much more cycles of sandpaper abrasion than other coatings reported in literature. It was micro-sized rGO that not only providing enough roughness but excellent mechanical strength and toughness as well for the composite coating.\nA schematic illustration of an S-GNE coating under cyclic sandpaper abrasion is shown in Fig. 5c.

      "text" : "To evaluate self-cleaning performance of the coatings, graphite powders were employed as contaminants and spread on the S-GNE surfaces (Fig. 6a). Apparently, the graphite powders were carried away completely by the water droplets. The lower surface adhesion allowed the water droplets to roll easily on the superhydrophobic coating surface, and take the contaminants away even without tilting surface. It was the rGO sheets adsorbed on the NPD surface during deposition that increasing nucleation sites for reduction of Ni ions [60], which results in forming an enough roughness composite coating. Therefore, the as-prepared S-GNE composite coating has a higher CA (162.7 0.8 ) than the superhydrophobic Zn coating [61] (155.29 ), which also fabricated by ECA process. The excellent superhydrophobicity of as-prepared composite coating contributes to the enhancement of self-cleaning ability. Fig. 6b schematically illustrates the self-cleaning process of the present coating surface. The pollutants lie flat on a pinecone-like S-GNE surface. A water droplet falls from a dropper and is compressed and deformed to be ellipsoidal first due to its gravity, which result in reaching the maximum contact area with the pollutants. Then, the low surface adhesion of the superhydrophobic coating provides a contact reaction-force to the water droplet, helping the water droplet bounce from the surface with the contaminants sticking on it. At last, the water droplet rolls off and takes the pollutants away smoothly. Amazingly, after 100-cycle sandpaper abrasion, the scratched S-GNE surfaces still exhibited excellent self-cleaning performance (Fig. 6c).

Inspired by the pinecone-shaped structure, a novel reduced-graphene oxide (rGO)/Ni composite coating with pinecone-like micro/nanostructures was fabricated successfully on a stainless steel substrate using a simple electrodeposition method combining Ni pre-deposition and an elevated current assistant approach. The results show that the coating is of self-cleaning and superhydrophicity with a water contact angle (CA) of 162.7 0.8 and a sliding angle (SA) of 2.5 1.0 . Importantly, the coating still maintains the excellent self-cleaning and superhydrophicity, water CA of 155.8 1.2 and SA of 5.9 1.2 , even after 100-cycle mechanical abrasion. Meanwhile, the coating also exhibits good anticorrosion performance in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, with 99.98% inhibition efficiency. The simple fabrication method may provide a cost-effective way to prepare mechanically durable, anticorrosive, self-cleaning and superhydrophobic coatings on metal substrates.",
