The effects of environmental factors on the adsorption-desorption properties of phenanthrene e.g. pH, heavy metal ions, and natural organic matter were also investigated. MCRG had the highest adsorption capacity for phenanthrene, mainly due to the larger surface area and pore volume, and numerous wrinkles of MCRG. The π–π interaction was the predominant adsorption mechanism of MCRG. Coexisting Cd(II) and As(V) had a minor impact on phenanthrene adsorption by MCRG, while the adsorption capacity of phenanthrene decreased considerably with coexisting humic acids. Phenanthrene caused desorption hysteresis, which was largely suppressed by humic acids. The desorption hysteresis was ascribed to the entrapment of phenanthrene molecules derived from the generation of closed interstitial spaces caused by the rearrangement of graphene\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2019.02.152 Received 2 December 2018; Received in revised form 30 January 2019; Accepted 21 February 2019\nAbbreviations: MGO, magnetic graphene oxide; MCRG, magnetic chemically-reduced graphene; MARG, magnetic annealing-reduced graphene; MGNs, magnetic graphene nanomaterials; GO, graphene oxide; DA models, Dubinin and Astakhov’s models; HI1, hysteresis index of the first desorption cycle; HI2, hysteresis index of the second desorption cycle; Qo, saturated adsorption capacity; KHW, the hexadecane–water partition coefficient; Kd/KHW, normalized adsorption coefficients; Qmax, theoretical, theoretical calculations of maximum adsorption capacities; Qtheoretical, C=C/C–C normalized theoretical calculations; Qmax, experimental, maximum adsorption capacities fitted by Langmuir model\n⁎ Corresponding author at: Institute of Soil and Water Resources and Environmental Science, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, 866 Yuhangtang Road, Hangzhou 310058, China.\nE-mail address: jmxu@zju.edu.cn (J.

      "text" : "Graphene, a two-dimensional allotrope of carbon, with a single layer of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, has attracted much attention from the scientific community due to its specific physical and chemical properties, large external surface area, and ease of modification [1–3]. Numerous graphene-based materials have been used in various processes and applications e.g. the development of electronic devices [4], energy-related materials [5], biomedicine [6], metrology and contaminant removal [1,3,7]. Adsorption is generally regarded as the most efficient and environmentally friendly method for the decontamination of pollutants [8,9]. Recently, nanomaterials derived from graphenebased materials have been reported to be extremely efficient in the adsorption of a variety of contaminants [10–12]. For example, there have been many recent studies on the decontamination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their derivatives, due to their high toxicity and long persistence [13].\nIn aquatic environments, multiple adsorbates often coexist and are frequently co-adsorbed onto graphene nanosheets [12,14]. The release of PAHs and heavy metals into aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems occur frequently during the processing of e-waste [15], and during urban stormwater runoff [16]. Naturally formed organic matter (organic matter) is ubiquitous in natural aquatic environments, where graphenefamily nanomaterials interact with inorganic ions and organic matter [1]. More importantly, both can induce morphological transformations of graphene and thus affect its adsorption capacity [17]. Chowdhury et al. [18] reported that the aggregation and improved dispersion of graphene oxide (GO) could be induced by inorganic ions and organic matter, respectively. The dispersion-aggregation of graphene-based nanomaterials and their desorption properties may be modified depending upon their surrounding solution chemistry and environmental conditions [2], which control the transport and fate of graphene-based nanomaterials and pollutants [1,19].\nDesorption is an important interfacial process in determining the fate, transport, and environmental risk of both graphene-based materials and organic contaminants in aqueous environments [2,19]. Irreversible hysteresis was detected when PAHs interacted with fullerene, which was ascribed to the deformation–rearrangement of fullerene, whereas no desorption hysteresis occurred with PAHs sorbed onto carbon nanotubes [20]. In the case of phenanthrene desorption from multilayer graphene, irreversible desorption hysteresis occurred, due to the folding and rearrangement of the graphene sheets [19]. A detailed understanding of the structure-dominated effects of adsorption-desorption of organic pollutants on graphene-based nanomaterials is crucial when producing graphene-based materials for various environmental applications and in risk assessments. For example, graphene oxide nanomaterials are difficult to isolate from water owing to their high dispersibility, which could cause new risks (e.g. increasing cytotoxicity of GO toward Escherichia coli, and growth inhibition of algae by GO) once released into the environment [1,21,22]. Magnetization by introducing Fe3O4 nanoparticles onto graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide contribute to better separation and more efficient adsorption, which increases practical applications such as their use in samplers, sorbents and detectors [23–25]. Previous studies revealed that magnetic graphene materials had high adsorption capacities for PAHs [26,27]. However, the current literature is mainly focused on the adsorption of PAHs by a single magnetic graphene material. The structure-dominated adsorption-desorption of organic pollutants onto graphene-based nanomaterials under different solution chemistry conditions has not yet been systematically evaluated.\nTherefore, the main objectives of this study were to: (1) identify mechanisms of interactions of phenanthrene with magnetic graphene nanomaterials (MGNs); (2) evaluate the adsorption-desorption behavior as affected by environmental factors (e.g. changes in cations, oxyanions and organic matter); (3) examine the conformation changes affecting the adsorption–desorption processes. Magnetic graphene oxide (MGO), magnetic chemically-reduced graphene (MCRG) and magnetic annealing-reduced graphene (MARG) were selected as adsorbents to better investigate the adsorption characteristics of MGNs containing different microstructures and oxygen contents. Phenanthrene was used as a model for PAHs [13,19,28]. Cadmium ions [Cd(II)] and arsenate anions [As(V)] were selected as model cation and oxyanion contaminants, respectively [12,29], and humic acid was selected as a model for organic matter [30]. Our aims were to provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and conformations that influence the adsorption-desorption behavior of PAHs molecules in natural aquatic environments."

The adsorption kinetics of MCRG were done using a solid-to-water ratio of 0.5 mg per 40mL and an initial phenanthrene concentration of 1mg/L. The reaction times ranged from 10min to 48 h. Our preliminary experiment showed the adsorption capacities of MGO and MARG at various times (24 and 48 h) were the same, indicating that 24 h was sufficient to attain the adsorption equilibrium.\nIsotherm experiments were conducted using a batch technique in a solution of 0.01M NaNO3 (as a supporting electrolyte) and 200mg/L NaN3 (as a bio-inhibitor) in Milli-Q water at pH 5.0 ± 0.1 (background solution). The stock solution of phenanthrene in acetonitrile was diluted in the background solution and the volume percentage of acetonitrile was maintained at below 0.1% to minimize cosolvent effects. Solid-to-water ratios for isotherm experiments were 0.8mg per 40mL for MGO, 0.5mg per 120mL for MCRG and 0.5mg per 40mL for\nMARG. A wide range of initial phenanthrene concentrations (0.01–1.2 mg/L) was used to achieve the desired equilibrium concentrations. The vials were agitated on a rotary shaker in the dark at 200 rpm for 24 h. The adsorbents were isolated by a powerful magnet and the supernatant provided residual concentrations by use of a reverse-phase HPLC equipped with a fluorescence detector.\nThe MCRG was selected to further study the adsorption behavior as affected by solution chemistry due to its superior adsorption capacity for phenanthrene. The water-to-solid ratio of MCRG was 0.5 mg per 40mL, and the initial phenanthrene concentration was 1mg/L. To investigate the effect of pH on adsorption, the initial pH values were adjusted to 2.0–12.0 with 0.1mol/L HNO3 or NaOH without any buffer. After equilibration, the residual concentrations and equilibrium pH values were measured. To examine the effect of heavy metal ions (i.e, Cd(II) and As(V)) on phenanthrene adsorption, the 1mg/L phenanthrene solutions, with initial concentrations of Cd(II) and As(V) ranging from 0mg/L to 100mg/L, were treated with the same procedure as above at pH 5.0. To evaluate the effects of humic acid on the sorption of phenanthrene on MCRG, humic acid (0–25.0mg/L) was added to the same solution as described in the sorption experiment."

Desorption experiments were conducted immediately after the completion of phenanthrene sorption onto MCRG with the supernatant being quickly replaced by the equivalent volume of corresponding background solution. The vials were then resealed and shaken for another 48 h to reach equilibration. The other experimental procedures were identical to the adsorption experiment. The desorption processes were repeated with a second desorption cycle and solvent extraction based recovery experiments were also conducted.

Details of the models and equations are given in SI.\nThe modified residual-concentration-specific relative sorption–desorption hysteresis indexes (HI1 and HI2 indicate the indexes of the first and second desorption processes in equilibrium, respectively) were applied to quantify and compare desorption hysteresis [34,35]. The HI1 and HI2 equations are as follows:\n=HI q q q( )/ |e d e s e s T Ce1 ,1 (1)\n=HI q q q( )/ |e d e s e s T Ce2 ,2 (2)\nwhere qes (mg/g), qed1 (mg/g), and qed2 (mg/g) are the solid-phase concentrations for adsorption, first desorption, and second desorption processes in equilibrium, respectively.

In this approach, at a given solute concentration, HI= 0 indicated no desorption hysteresis (i.e., adsorption and desorption isotherms of the solute were overlapped), while more significant hysteresis happened at a higher HI value (i.e., the desorption isotherm of the solute is significantly larger than the adsorption isotherm)."

      "text" : "Several characterization methods were applied to identify the best method of synthesis of MGNs. The zeta potentials showed that Fe3O4 and GO were oppositely charged within the pH range of 1 to 7 (Fig. S1a). The prepared products were also characterized by FTIR (Fig. S2). The peak appearing in MGO at approximately 555 cm−1 was attributed to the Fe–O vibrations [36]. The XRD patterns also indicated the high\nquality of the prepared MGNs (Fig. S3). The sharp diffraction peaks of XRD were assigned to the (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (4 2 2), (5 1 1), (4 4 0), and (5 3 3) reflections, respectively. They were consistent with the characteristic crystalline spinel structure (JCPDS 88-0315) of Fe3O4 [37,38]. The values of magnetic saturation of MGO, MCRG and MARG were 33.0, 53.9 and 70.7 emu/g (Fig. S4), respectively, indicating that the magnetism was strong enough for many practical applications [39].\nThe microscopic surface morphologies and structures of MGO, MCRG, and MARG were characterized by SEM and TEM, and typical images are presented in Fig. 1. The typical ripples of graphene nanosheets disappeared in the SEM images (Fig. 1 a-c) with the doping of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Nevertheless, transparent and slightly aggregated GO nanosheet films were observed in TEM images (Fig. 1d), in which the wrinkles were mainly located in combinations of GO and Fe3O4 [39]. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles (10–20 nm size) were loosely anchored in the monolayer and in a few layers (2–5 layers) of the GO matrix. The basal plane of the GO was almost unoccupied by the magnetic nanoparticles in MGO (Fig. 1d). In comparison, dense aggregates of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and curved surfaces were observed in MCRG and MARG (Fig. 1e-f). The increases in curved surfaces and porous structure are shown in the SEM images of MCRG (Fig. 1b), which had the most wrinkles.\nChemical reduction of MGO to MCRG increased the BET specific surface areas (SA) from 95.20 to 145.31m2/g and the total pore volume from 0.164 to 0.430m3/g (Table 1), respectively. Thermal reduction of MGO to MARG increased the total pore volume of graphene nanosheets to 0.217m3/g, but decreased the surface area to 78.72m2/g (Table 1). In the Raman spectra, the intensity ratio of the D and G bands (ID/IG) is usually applied to estimate the extent of defects in carbon materials [9]. The ID/IG ratio of MCRG (1.29) was higher than those of MGO (1.01) and MARG (1.03) (Table 1 and Fig. S5). In contrast, chemical reduction generated more porous and wrinkled structures.\nThe surface functional group composition or defects of MGNs samples were examined by XPS (Fig. 2). The peaks of Fe 2p, C 1s, and O 1s were observed in XPS spectra. The deconvolution of the C 1 s peak of MGO indicated the presence of C]C/CeC (∼284.6), CeO (∼285.2), C]O (286.9), and CeC]O (287.8) groups (Fig. 2). The results of the relative atomic percentages are given in Table 1. The contents of C]C/ CeC followed the order: MARG > MCRG > MGO."

All of the isotherms were better fitted by the DA model than the Freundlich and Langmuir models, as indicated by their larger R2 values.\nThe saturated adsorption capacity (Qo) of phenanthrene by the samples followed the order: MGO < MARG < MCRG (Table S1), which was the same order as the total pore volume. The pores were classified as mesopores in the three materials. The specific surface area of MCRG (145.31m2/g) was about 1.5 times that of MGO (95.20m2/g), while the Qo of phenanthrene onto MCRG (34.37mg/g) was approximately 2.5 times that of MGO (14.32mg/g). The deviation from the Langmuir model was larger with the MCRG isotherm compared with MARG and MGO. In addition, the Freundlich N value (0.253 ± 0.016) of MCRG was the smallest of the three materials [40]."

The effect of pH value on the adsorption capacity of phenanthrene was not obvious. Nevertheless, the surface properties (e.g. surface charge) of the MCRG and the conversion of functional groups during protonation-\ndeprotonation processes were affected by pH (2.0–12.0), as signified by the zeta potentials (Fig. S1b).\nThe effects of Cd(II) and As(V) on phenanthrene (1mg/L) adsorption are shown in Fig. 4b-c. The adsorption of phenanthrene onto MCRG (Fig. 4b) slightly increased with Cd(II) concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 mg/L, and was gradually suppressed with increasing Cd(II) concentrations (1.0–100.0mg/L). When As(V) (1.0mg/L) was added, the adsorption of phenanthrene by MCRG was firstly suppressed by about 15.0% and then reached a relative steady state with the coexisting As(V) concentrations, which varied from 1 to 100mg/L (Fig. 4c). Therefore, the coexisting Cd(II) and As(V) had different effects on the adsorption of phenanthrene onto MCRG. Phenanthrene adsorption (1.0mg/L) by MCRG gradually decreased with increasing humic acid concentrations (1–25mg/L), decreasing by approximately 20% with 25mg/L humic acid (Fig. 4d)."

There was significant irreversible hysteresis of phenanthrene during the two cycles of desorption, judging from the desorption hysteresis index (HI) values (HI > 0) [34]. Upon lowering the phenanthrene concentration from 1 to 0.1mg/L, the desorption hysteresis of phenanthrene from MCRG clearly decreased. In addition, HI2 was higher than HI1 at a given phenanthrene concentration. The desorption hysteresis index (HI1 and HI2) values of four experimental treatments on MCRG followed the order PHE < PHE+As < PHE+Cd < PHE+HA. The desorption processes were suppressed by 10mg/L Cd(II), As(V), or humic acid. Notably, significant desorption hysteresis of an initial 1 mg/L phenanthrene plus 10mg/L humic acid (p < 0.05) occurred, but not with the absence of humic acid. In comparison, the effect of Cd(II) or As(V) on phenanthrene desorption was not significant.\nTo further confirm the phenomenon of desorption hysteresis, solvent extraction recovery experiments were conducted to examine the mass balance of MCRG and phenanthrene (1mg/L) (Table 2). The mass loss of MCRG was closely controlled by magnetic separation in the experiments. The mass loss of phenanthrene was less than 4% with MCRG. 1mg/L phenanthrene was selected to carry out the representative solvent extraction recovery experiments due to the higher HI values.\nSA, Vtotal, Vmicro, Vmeso, and Vmacro of magnetic graphene were measured by the BET-N2 method.

      "text" : "To investigate the adsorption mechanisms beyond hydrophobic interactions, the hexadecane–water partition coefficient (KHW=34,581 L/kg for phenanthrene) and normalized adsorption coefficients (Kd/KHW) of phenanthrene were applied to adjust for hydrophobic effects [3,41]. The Kd/KHW variations of phenanthrene onto MGO, MCRG, and MARG are given in Fig. 5 and the maximum values are listed in Table 3. The calculated Kd/KHW ratios of phenanthrene with MGNs followed the order MCRG > MGO > MARG and were consistent with the magnitudes of the specific surface area and micro pore volume (Vmicro). The Kd/KHW value of MCRG (335.48) was about\n14 times higher than that of MARG (23.27), despite the comparative phenanthrene adsorption capacities of the two materials. Although the Kd/KHW ratio of MARG (23.27) was only half of that of MGO (45.30), the experimental maximum adsorption capacity (Qmax) of MARG (26.18mg/g) was almost twice as large as that of MGO (13.65mg/g).\nThe calculations of maximum adsorption capacities (Qmax, theoretical) were obtained by assuming that phenanthrene molecules form planar adsorption on magnetic graphene materials. Based on the molecular area of phenanthrene (1.00 nm2) [3], the Qmax, theoretical of phenanthrene with MGO, MCRG, and MARG were 28.17, 43.00 and 23.29mg/ g, respectively. The C]C/CeC normalized theoretical calculations (Qtheoretical) were obtained by multiplying Qmax, theoretical and the\npercent of C]C/CeC. The Qtheoretical values are presented in Table 3. The Qtheoretical values of MGO, MCRG and MARG were 67.0%, 80.8% and 59.5% of the corresponding Qmax, experimental values. The relative difference between Qtheoretical and Qmax, experimental for MGO and MCRG were 33.0% and 19.2% and they were significantly less than MARG (40.5%).\nThe C 1s XPS spectra of MGO, MCRG, and MARG before and after the adsorption of 10mg/L phenanthrene were analyzed to further verify the mechanism of phenanthrene adsorption. The C]C/CeC band proportions of the samples were all increased after phenanthrene adsorption (Fig. 6) and the increased range in MCRG was much higher than that in MARG, agreeing with the order of phenanthrene adsorption capacity.\nThe different morphologies of MCRG after adsorption were monitored by TEM. Heteromorphic folds and rearrangements of graphene nanosheets (Fig. 7) were observed on MCRG following adsorption of phenanthrene. The morphology of MCRG with adsorbed phenanthrene\nin the absence and presence of 1mg/L Cd(II) were similar (Fig. 7b-c). Following the adsorption of 1mg/L phenanthrene and 100mg/L Cd(II) by MCRG (Fig. 7d), the scrolls of the graphene sheets were mostly unfolded, and the flat surface area was increased with many fewer wrinkles and grooves [40]. Much agglomeration of MCRG occurred with 100mg/L As(V) and 25mg/L humic acid, where the graphene nanosheets were strongly stacked together (Fig. 7e)."

The combination of Fe3O4 and graphene nanosheets was stable, with no graphene nanosheets dissociating from the MGNs even under ultrasonication. The FTIR and XRD analyses demonstrated the successful synthesis of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles in MGNs (Figs. S2 and S3) [36,39]. The TEM images (Fig. 1e-f) indicated Fe3O4 that nanoparticles were appropriately wrapped by GO and graphene, and the reduction of MGO induced serious wrinkles and overlaps on the graphene nanosheets. The chemical reduction of MGO significantly increased the wrinkles and porous structures (Fig. 1b, e), and created more graphitic structural defects and smaller sizes of newly formed sp2-hybridized regions as indicated by the ID/IG values (Table 1 and Fig. S5) [3]. Thermal reduction increased hydrophobicity and reduced MGO more thoroughly than chemical reduction (Table1). Hence, the adsorption mechanisms should be determined when relating the structures with the adsorption properties of MGNs.\nCompared with Freundlich and Langmuir models, DA models showed a better fit for the isotherms (Fig. 3 and Table S1). There are two possible explanations for the result: (1) the pores were mainly composed of mesopores in the three materials and were accessible spaces for the adsorption phenanthrene molecules, since the length of the side of a phenanthrene molecule is 1.213 nm [3] and small enough to occupy the adsorption sites distributed in mesopores and macropores; (2) compared with carbon nanotubes, graphene-based materials\npossess opened-up layer structures that have completely accessible adsorption surfaces for organic molecules [42]. As reported in the literature, the DA model fitted E and bmight also describe the distribution of sorption site energy [43]. Therefore, both surface and pore sorption sites were available for the adsorption process, which were also reflected by isotherms being better fitted by the DA models [3]. The saturated adsorption capacity (Qo) and total pore volume of the three magnetic graphene materials followed the identical order MCRG > MARG > MGO. The heterogeneity of the adsorption sites of MCRG was larger than that of the other two materials, as shown by the larger deviation from the Langmuir model and the smaller Freundlich N value compared with MARG and MGO [40,44]. Compared with other common adsorbents (Table S2) [40,45–47], MCRG was the most efficient at adsorbing phenanthrene. The results were consistent with previous studies [41,48] of the structure of graphene-based materials,\naQmax, experimental were obtained from maximum adsorption capacities of magnetic graphene materials toward phenanthrene in sorption isotherms fitted by Langmuir model, mg/g. Qmax, theoretical were obtained by calculating the maximum adsorption capacities when molecules formed planar adsorption on magnetic graphene materials based on molecular area of phenanthrene and the specific surface area of MGNs, mg/g. Qtheoretical values were obtained by multiplying Qmax, theoretical and corresponding C]C/CeC percent of MGNs. KHW is the hexadecane-water partition coefficient. Kd/KHW is the normalized distribution coefficient at a certain equilibrium concentration that Kd reaches the maximum value.\nwhere MCRG had more grooves. They are considered to be high surface energy sites, where the phenanthrene molecules are preferentially adsorbed [40]. The rapid equilibration (60min) (Fig. S6) also demonstrated the high adsorption efficiency of MCRG, which indicated that it might be a promising candidate for efficient elimination of PAHs from aqueous solutions.\nIt is well-known that the hydrophobic nature of PAHs contributes to their adsorption to graphene-based materials [41]. The results from Kd/ KHW ratios of phenanthrene sorbed by MGNs suggested that the MGNs with the highest surface area and most wrinkles had the highest adsorption affinities to phenanthrene (Table 3). The large difference between Kd/KHW ratios and experimental maximum adsorption capacity (Qmax) values of MARG and MGO demonstrated that the hydrophobic effect played an important role in phenanthrene adsorption onto MARG. For MGO, the experimental Qmax (13.65mg/g) was much lower than that of Qmax, theoretical (28.17mg/g), due to the water clusters created on the surface of the hydrophilic MGO by numerous oxygen-containing functional groups [49,50], the interactions between MGO and nonpolar phenanthrene were weaker than those of MCRG and MARG. However, the Qmax, experimental of MARG was higher than the corresponding Qmax, theoretical, indicating that the surface adsorption of phenanthrene was not simply planar or monolayer adsorption. The sp2-hybridized structures play critical roles in PAH adsorption by graphene nanosheets [40]. The relationship between Qtheoretical and Qmax, experimental values suggested that the surface adsorption sites on MGO, MCRG and MARG were due to surface adsorption and other driving forces (e.g. hydrophobic effects and pore-filling) [3]. The relative differences between Qtheoretical and Qmax, experimental were in good agreement with the large contribution of hydrophobic effects in phenanthrene adsorption by MARG as discussed above. The π−π interaction was the primary adsorption mechanism for MGO and MCRG, while the adsorption of phenanthrene by MARG was mainly through both π−π interaction and hydrophobic interactions. As previously reported, the π−π interaction between PAHs and GO was\nstill operating due to the residual π-electrons on GO [51]. Compared to MGO, MCRG has more grooved regions and sp2-hybridized structures, which have been demonstrated to show high surface energy and could be active adsorption sites for the removal of PAHs [40]. Although the specific surface area of MGO is slightly larger than that of MARG, the adsorption capacity of MGO was inferior to that of MARG. The phenomenon might be due to that hydrophilic MGO possesses more oxygencontaining functional groups [33] and has more exposed adsorption sites, while the available adsorption sites of MGO was less than that of hydrophobic MARG, which further demonstrated that the great importance of π–π interaction and hydrophobic interactions in the adsorption process. The increase in the C]C/CeC band proportions of the three materials after phenanthrene adsorption (Fig. 6) also demonstrated the π–π interactions. Obviously, the increased range of band proportion in MCRG was much higher than those in MARG and MGO, which was in consistent with the higher phenanthrene adsorption capacity of MCRG. The increasement of C]C/CeC band proportion was attributed to the π–π interaction between the graphene nanosheets and phenanthrene molecules [21]."

      "text" : "Previous studies [52–54] have demonstrated that adsorption of organics by carbonaceous was a complex function of adsorbent properties and solute molecular structure. Solution pH is one of the most important factors regulating the adsorption characteristics of adsorbents, as pH may alter their surface charge as well as the speciation of solutes [14,55]. MCRG is a highly-efficient adsorbent for the removal of PAHs over a wide pH range (2.0–12.0). Similarly, the adsorption of phenanthrene onto MCRG is not significantly affected by the solution pH [14].\nwCd(II) [56] and As(V) [23] can be adsorbed by magnetic graphene materials. Although the sorption processes of Cd(II), As(V), and\nphenanthrene occurred on different adsorption sites of MCRG [14,23], the adsorption of phenanthrene was affected slightly by the coexisting heavy metal ions. The slight enhancement of phenanthrene adsorption at low Cd(II) concentrations (1.0 mg/L) is possibly due to the formation of new adsorption sites created by cation–π interactions [1,14,57]. The suppression of phenanthrene adsorption by MCRG coupled with As(V) was negligible within the experimental range of As(V) concentrations of 1 to 100mg/L.\nAs(V) exists as the anion (H2AsO4-) at pH 5.0, and is adsorbed by MCRG by electrostatic interactions [58,59]. The adsorption of As(V) may also compress the electrical double-layer and neutralize the surface charge of MCRG, thus resulting in aggregation of graphene nanosheets on MCRG [1,17]. Yang et al. [17] showed that heavy metal ions could cause morphological transformation of GO. Combined with previous studies [3,40,60], the TEM analysis (Fig. 7) of MCRG after adsorption indicated that the conformational change of MCRG occurred due to coexisting heavy metal ions, which might decrease available adsorption sites of MCRG and so decrease the sorption of phenanthrene.\nHumic acid macromolecules contain oxygen-functional groups and they are much larger than phenanthrene molecules, thus they would not readily enter micropores of MCRG due to steric hindrance [61]. Humic acid molecules perform multiple roles in the adsorption process. They are reported to be adsorbed onto reduced graphene oxide by hydrophobic and π-π interactions [1], thus they could obstruct some of the adsorption paths and remain between the graphene materials and phenanthrene molecules. This was also indicated by the high agglomeration of MCRG in the presence of humic acid (Fig. 7f). Beside competitive adsorption, humic acid can provide new adsorption sites for phenanthrene molecules. Consequently, the integrated effect of humic acid on phenanthrene adsorption onto MCRG was suppression. A similar adsorption suppression phenomenon was also observed with phenanthrene adsorption onto carbon-based functional materials (activated carbon and biochar) as affected by humic acid [62]. The adsorption suppression by organic matter on graphene-based nanomaterials (both graphene and GO) was less than that caused by carbon nanotubes and activated carbon, which is mainly attributed to the lower micropore volumes of graphene-based nanomaterials compared with carbon nanotubes and activated carbon materials [1]."

      "heading" : "4.3. Desorption mechanisms of phenanthrene from MGRG in the presence and absence of Cd(II), As(V) and humic acid",
      "text" : "Desorption hysteresis on magnetic graphene materials is an interfacial process affecting the mobility and fate of adsorbates in aquatic environments [1,63]. Generally, the high recovery (98–100%) suggested that the mass balance was not the reason for desorption hysteresis (Table 2). Our preliminary experiments indicated that the adsorption and desorption processes of phenanthrene reached equilibrium within 48 h. Other reasons for possible artificial hysteresis, such as the degradation of phenanthrene, and an inadequate time allowed for diffusive equilibrium during the sorption or desorption processes (Fig. S7), were also excluded [34]. Therefore, the desorption hysteresis observed in the study was validated. Owing to the absence of functional groups on phenanthrene molecules, covalent bonds are not formed on the surface of MCRG. Accordingly, the formation of chemical bonds on MCRG can be excluded from the hysteresis phenomenon.\nThe desorption processes of phenanthrene in the presence of 10mg/ L Cd(II), As(V), or humic acid were very different, even though the degree of stacking of MCRG in the presence of 10mg/L As(V) and humic acid was comparable (Fig. 7e,f). One possible explanation for the difference in the hysteresis phenomenon was that the size of an individual Cd(II) ion (0.426 nm) [14] and As(V) (> 0.22 nm) [64] are much smaller than humic acid molecules, and the steric hindrance originating from Cd(II) and As(V) was much weaker than the adsorption paths obstructed by humic acid molecules [2]. Therefore, co-occurring macromolecules would make it more complicated for the desorption of\nphenanthrene from MCRG to occur. Due to desorption hysteresis, phenanthrene would be sequestered within MGNs aggregates in aquatic environments, thus decreasing contaminant bioavailability and environmental risks. However, enhanced environmental risks would occur if the graphene pollutant complexes were transferred to aquatic environments e.g. estuaries or accumulated by animals and humans.\nIn summary, owing to their excellent adsorption capacity and ease of dissociation, MGNs have great potential for reusability, magnetic solidphase extraction and other treatments of environmental pollutants. Slight suppression of coexisting Cd(II) and As(V) was observed on the adsorption-desorption behavior of phenanthrene, even though much dispersion and agglomeration of MCRG were affected by the coexisting Cd(II) and As(V), respectively. Co-occurring macromolecules (e.g. humic acids) would increase the complexity of the desorption of phenanthrene from MGNs. This would also result in problems when determining the fate and risk assessment of MGNs as phenanthrene carriers."

      "heading" : "5. Conclusions",
      "text" : "MCRG had the highest adsorption capacity and fastest adsorption rate of phenanthrene in all absorbents, and was little affected by pH and coexisting Cd(II) and As(V). Humic acids considerably decreased the adsorption of phenanthrene by MCRG. Surface adsorption and porefilling were responsible for phenanthrene adsorption onto MGNs, and the dominant mechanism for phenanthrene adsorption was π–π interactions onto MGO and MCRG. Irreversible hysteresis was observed when phenanthrene interacted with MCRG, and it was more significant in the presence of humic acid. The morphology of MCRG after the adsorption of phenanthrene suggested that the phenomenon caused by adsorbed coexisting humic acids was attributed to the folding and rearrangement of MCRG. The findings provide a better understanding of potential applications and risks assessment of MGNs in complicated environments, which might be promising in removing organic pollutants from water and soil. Further research on the recycling and stability of MGNs, and potential toxicity of MGNs to plants, animals and microbes in different natural environments are required."
