      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Our stolen futurewas published by scientists Theo Colborn, John Peterson Myers and science journalist Dianne Dumanoski (Colborn et al., 1996). Like Rachel Carson's groundbreaking Silent Spring, to which it is being compared, the book raises the specter of a world awash in endocrine disruptors (Johnson, 1996). Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that may interfere with endocrine (or hormone) system and cause birth defects, diabetes, obesity, prostate cancer in males, and other developmental disorders (Gore et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2016b, 2017b, 2017c; Jung et al., 2013; Xiong et al., 2017, 2018a, 2018b; Xue et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2017, 2018a, 2019b). Endocrine disruptors commonly detected in wastewaters and the environment or even in people include bisphenol A, polychlorinated biphenyls, phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, Pb2þ, Cd2þ, Hg2þ, etc. (Diamanti-Kandarakis et al., 2009; Gong et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2017a; Liu et al., 2016; Petrie et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014).\nHeavy metals such as Pb2þ, Cd2þ and Hg2þ affect the endocrine system, causing alterations in physiological functions (Huang et al., 2018; Iavicoli et al., 2009; Zeng et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016a). Compared with organic endocrine disruptors, they are mobile, nonbiodegradable, and can accumulate in living organisms. Blood Pb2þ levels ranging from 5 to 10 mg dl 1 were associated with neurobehavioral disorders and an obvious reduction in children's cognitive capacity (Hu et al., 2018; Surkan et al., 2007). Cd2þ exposure is linked to osteoporosis, hypertension, leukemia, renal pathologies, lung cancer etc. (Satoh et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2018a). Exposure to trace amount of Hg2þ can cause arrhythmia, arrhythmia, kidney damage, and central nervous system defects (Zeng et al., 2017). Therefore, it is significant to develop effective technologies to treat heavy metals, especially metal endocrine disruptors, polluted wastewater before their discharge into natural environment.\nNumerous techniques have been applied to eliminate Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Hg2þ from aqueous solutions, including phytoremediation, chemical precipitation, ion exchange, adsorption, etc. (Wang and Chen, 2009;Wang et al., 2013, 2014, 2018). Among these methods, adsorption is one of the most reported technologies for the removal of heavy metals because it is simple and sustainable. Pyrogenic carbonaceous materials refer to the solid pyrolysis products including engineered carbons (activated carbon, biochar, charcoal, etc.) and carbon nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, graphene, graphene oxide, etc.). In recent years, pyrogenic carbonaceous materials especially engineered carbons and carbon nanomaterials as industrially attractive sorbents for the remediation of endocrine disruptors from water and/or soil have been widely investigated (Guo et al., 2018; Lai et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018; Titirici and Antonietti, 2010; Zhang et al., 2016b; Zhou et al., 2018b). The carbonaceous materials at nanoscale have sparked new interest into investigating the potential of finding a sorbent superior to biochar and activated carbon. Beless and co-workers studied the efficacy of carbonaceous materials including biochar, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and graphene oxide for removal of polychlorinated biphenyls from aqueous solution, driving the necessity to reveal the adsorption behaviors of these carbonaceous materials with specific organic endocrine disruptors (Beless et al., 2014). Traditionally used activated carbon (AC) has been proved to be an excellent adsorbent for its availability of sorption-specific extensive surface area and microporous structure (Xu et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018b). Biochar (BC), as a carbon (C)-rich product when biomass such as wood, manure or leaves is heated with little or without air, has the AC-like structure and properties. And it has been extensively investigated for carbon sequestration,\ngreenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions mitigation, pollution control, and enhancement of crop yield (Yang et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2016a; Tan et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016b). Carbon nanotubes (CNT), both single and multiwalled, have been tested to determine their adsorption behavior to heavy metals and persistent organic pollutant (Yang et al., 2018a; Song et al., 2017). Compared with AC, BC, and CNT, relatively few researches of graphene (GE) and graphene oxide (GO) as adsorbents have been conducted (Wu et al., 2014).\nFully considering the possibility of practical application, the purpose of the present work is to compare CNT and GO with the more widely used AC and BC for adsorption of three metal endocrine disruptors (Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Hg2þ). The behaviors of Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Hg2þ adsorption by carbonaceous materials were studied. The underlying adsorption mechanisms of oxygen-containing functional groups on Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Hg2þ by carbonaceous materials were revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The competitive adsorption between Pb2þ, Cd2þ and Hg2þwas also investigated. Moreover, the cost analysis of carbonaceous materials was also performed. To attain an unbiased comparison, no attempt was made to improve the solubility of the carbonaceous materials or prevent them from flocculating."

Lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2), mercuric chloride (HgCl2), and cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2$4H2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\nBiochar samples were produced from rice straw (contain approximately 38.1% cellulose, 16.8% hemicellulose and 11.2% lignin) according to our previous method (Huang et al., 2016a; Zhang et al., 2016b), and biochars produced at 300 C (BC300) and 600 C (BC600) were selected to run this comparison. Commercial bamboo AC and commercial multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) with diameters ranging from 10 to 20 nm were purchased from Shanghai Zhenghai Active Carbon Co.

Pb2þ, Cd2þ and Hg2þ concentrations were 100, 30, 2mg L 1, respectively. The initial pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.0± 0.1 with 0.1M HNO3 and NaOH solution. All the covered conical flasks were agitated on a water bath shaker at 25± 1 C and 100 rpm. Two milliliters of sample\nwere taken at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 120, 180, 300, 600, 900, 1200 and 1500min for analysis of Pb2þ, Cd2þ and Hg2þ concentration. Adsorption isotherms of Pb2þ, Cd2þ and Hg2þ were determined by adding 40mg of BC300, BC600, AC, CNT or GO with 20mL Pb2þ, Cd2þ or Hg2þ solution of different concentrations ranging from 1 to 400, 1e200 and 0.1e10mg L 1, respectively. The suspensions were shaken at 100 rpm at 25± 1 C for 10 h. Then the samples were withdrawn and filtered through 0.22 mmpore size nylonmembrane filters to determine the concentrations of Pb2þ, Cd2þ and Hg2þ via inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICPOES). The amounts of Pb2þ, Cd2þ and Hg2þ adsorbed onto the carbonaceous materials were calculated from the differences between the initial and final concentrations. All the experiments were conducted in triplicate and the results were calculated as the mean values. Control experiments without adsorbents revealed that the adsorption of Pb2þ, Cd2þ and Hg2þ onto the surface of conical flask was negligible."

The solvation energies were calculated using the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) with the SMD model (Marenich et al., 2009), and water was chosen as the solvent for consistency with the experiment.

      "text" : "Elemental analyses of BC300, BC600, AC, CNT and GO are presented in Table 1, which shows the difference between the five adsorbents. The H/C atomic ratio was calculated to evaluate the aromaticity and the (O þ N)/C was calculated to evaluate the polarity (Chen et al., 2008). Relatively lower H/C atomic ratios of 0.18 for CNT than AC (0.31), BC600 (0.37), GO (0.42) and BC300 (0.88), indicating that CNT, AC and biochar produced under higher temperature were highly carbonized, and presented a highly aromatic structure. Moreover, the (O þ N)/C atomic ratios were in the order:\nGO > BC300 > BC600 > CNT > AC, indicating a decrease of the surface polar functional groups (Rajapaksha et al., 2014). The atomic ratios of O/C represent the hydrophilicity of the five adsorbents (Ahmad et al., 2013). As illustrated in Table 1, BC600, AC and CNT are less hydrophilic than BC300 and GO. Compared to the surface area of BC300 (8.12m2 g 1), BC600, commercial AC, CNT and GO have much larger surface area. The surface area of commercial AC (792.65m2 g 1) is more than 97 times that of BC300. Themicrophotographs of the adsorbents are shown in Fig. 1. Porous and amorphous structure of BC300 (Fig.1a) and BC600 (Fig.1b), and vesicles caused by the release of volatile components were observed (Zhang et al., 2016b). Commercial AC appeared as bulk and contained a large number of microporous structures according to the larger surface area (Fig. 1c). CNTs with diameters ranging from 10 to 20 nm were presented in aggregation in its native state (Fig. 1d). GO produced via Hummers and Offeman's method presented the layer structure of the parent graphite and the layers were folded (Fig. 1e).\nThe surface oxygen-containing functional groups have strong adsorption capacity with heavy metals. Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Hg2þ are adsorbed mainly via interactions with surface functional groups. In order to investigate the surface functionality of pyrogenic carbonaceous materials, the five adsorbents were examined using XPS. The XPS C1s peaks of BC300, BC600, AC, CNT, and GO were presented in Fig. 2, which clearly showed that the oxygen containing groups were prevalent on the surface of carbonaceous materials. The binding energy of C1s at 284.8 eV was assigned to aliphatic/ aromatic carbon, including CeC, CeH, and C]C. 286.0e286.2 eV, 287.6 eV, and 289.1e289.8 eV were attached to the oxygencontaining moieties, that is, CeO, C]O, and OeC]O, respectively (Wang et al., 2018b; Zhang et al., 2016b). And their relative percentages obtained via XPSPEAK version 4.1 were listed in Table 2. Fig. 2a and b revealed that with the rise of preparation temperature, oxygen containing functional groups (CeO) decreased rapidly and OeC]O gradually formed. And these results are consistent with our previous conclusions (Zhang et al., 2016b). The CeC intensity of BC600 was much higher than that of BC300, indicating a high graphitization degree of higher temperature pyrolysis biochar. Commercial AC with large surface area also contained a certain amount of CeO and OeC]O. For commercial CNT, oxygen containing functional groups were generated at the surface during the process of purification in aqueous HNO3 solution. Fig. 2e revealed that GO contained large amount of oxygen containing functional groups including CeO and OeC]O. Thus, the graphitization degree of GO was the lowest in the five adsorbents, which could be observed by the intensity of aliphatic/aromatic carbon in Fig. 2e. And in heavy metals adsorption by carbonaceous materials, the proposed mechanisms including electrostatic attraction, ion exchange, and complexation are related to the contents and varieties of surface oxygen containing groups (Tan et al., 2015).\nThermal decomposition resulted in the greatest mass loss in the temperature ranges of about 300e450 C, 400e520 C, 450e570 C, 500e650 C and 500e600 C for BC300, BC600, AC, CNT and GO, respectively. The combustible components in tested carbonaceous materials reacted with oxygen and the burning point was in the order of BC300< BC600< AC<GO< CNT from the DTG curves (Fig. 3). The main peak values were about 0.90% C 1 for BC300, 1.19% C 1 for BC600, 1.18% C 1 for AC, 0.91% C 1 for CNT, and 0.74% C 1 for GO, respectively. And the corresponding temperature were about 392.4 C for BC300, 520.7 C for BC600, 522.9 C for AC, 599.9 C for CNT, and 577.9 C for GO, respectively. These revealed the different inflammability of tested carbonaceous materials. The DSC curves of the combustion process in Fig. S1 showed the variations of the combustion heat release rate with the increasing of temperature, indicating the different exothermic\nproperties of the tested carbonaceous materials."

      "text" : "The pH influences the charge transfer on the solid/liquid interface and also the removal of metal endocrine disruptors (Pb2þ, Cd2þ and Hg2þ) in solution. Fig. 4 showed the experiment results with a pH range from 2.0 to 7.0. Changes in initial solution pH values significantly influenced the adsorption of Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Hg2þ onto the tested carbonaceousmaterials. In general, the removal rate of the metal ions by carbonaceous materials increased gradually with the increase of solution pH. For all the carbonaceousmaterials, a significant increase of Pb2þ, Cd2þ and Hg2þ removal efficiencywas observed when the solution pH increased from 2.0 to 5.0, and then a plateau was reached. These results were similar to previous reports (Cui et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). In an acidic solution, the species of surface groups were eOH and eCOOH. The decrease of solution pH led to neutralization of surface charge and caused the decrease of cation adsorption capacity. Moreover, the competitions on eO- and eCOO- sites between metal cations and proton in an acidic solution also contributed to a lower adsorption capacity. The increase of solution pH would convert more groups to eO- and eCOO-, providing electrostatic interactions for cationic species removal (Madadrang et al., 2012). It is noteworthy that a high pH\nvalue (>7.0) will cause a hydrolysis process of metal cations and form metal hydroxide. The higher removal rates of metal cations were a combination of both adsorption and precipitation. It has been reported that the dominant mercury species at pH< 4.0 are Hg2þ, and at pH> 6 are Hg(OH)2 (Tan et al., 2015). The low Hg2þ removal rate at lower pH was attributed to the competition with Hþ. Under higher pH, the formation of Hg(OH)2 caused the decrease of electrostatic attraction. While the eO- and eCOO- could enhance the formation of COHgþ and COOHgþ, the removal rate of Hg2þ still maintained higher level."

For the tested metal ions, almost 90% of the ultimate adsorption occurred in 120min, and the adsorption equilibrium was reached within 300min of shaking. Pseudo-firstorder model and pseudo-second-order model were used to simulate the adsorption kinetics data. The calculated values are listed in Table S1. The R2 values of the pseudo-second-order model were higher than that of the pseudo-first-order model, which indicated that the adsorption rate was mainly determined by the chemical adsorption process. And it means that exchange, electron transfer and chemical bond were occurred in the process of adsorption (Cui\net al., 2015). For Pb2þ (100mg L 1), the adsorption capacity of tested carbonaceous materials was in the order of GO> BC300>AC> CNT> BC600. For Cd2þ (30mg L 1) and Hg2þ (2mg L 1), the adsorption capacity of tested carbonaceous materials was in the order of GO BC300> AC> CNT BC600 and AC BC300 CNT>GO> BC600, respectively. These results indicated that the adsorption of Pb2þ, Cd2þ and Hg2þ onto carbonaceous materials might be controlled by multiple mechanisms, and for different metal ions the contribution rate of different mechanisms was different. Surface functional groups and surface area of adsorbents might be the criteria for efficient removal of metal ions (Cai and Jia, 2010)."

The calculated values are listed in Table S2. According to the isotherms and isotherm parameters, the adsorption equilibrium data were well fitted to Langmuir model with the coefficients higher than 0.95, which indicated that monolayer physical adsorption played a dominating role. It was noteworthy that Freundlich model could fit the adsorption equilibrium data with lower coefficients. It revealed that chemical interactionsmight be also involved. The obtained results are in accordance with our previous works, indicating that Langmuir model is better fitting of heavy metals adsorption by pyrogenic carbonaceous matters than the Freundlich model (Gong et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2015). The adsorption capacities determined on the maximal experimental amount adsorbed at equilibrium time for the five adsorbents were in the order as follows: GO (357.7mg g 1)> BC600 (115.0mg g 1)> BC300 (70.6mg g 1)> CNT (63.5mg g 1)>AC (54.7mg g 1) for Pb2þ, GO (92.5mg g 1)> BC300 (77.0mg g 1)>AC (66.1mg g 1)> BC600 (58.3mg g 1)> CNT (52.4mg g 1) for Cd2þ, and GO (6.5mg g 1)> BC300 (6.2mg g 1) AC (6.1mg g 1)> CNT (4.4mg g 1)> BC600\n(2.1mg g 1) for Hg2þ, respectively. The results indicated that the dominated adsorption mechanisms for Pb2þ, Cd2þ and Hg2þ were different. Pb2þwas themost retained cation and Cd2þwith was less retained cation. Whereas Hg2þ was the most difficult metal ions to be adsorbed. The reported similar or related systems results were also published. Park and co-workers reported that the maximum adsorption capacities of metal ions by biochar were in the order of Pb2þ (102mg g 1)> Cd2þ (86mg g 1)> Cr3þ (65mg g 1)> Cu2þ (55mg g 1) (Park et al., 2016). Wang et al. studied the adsorption behavior and the relative distribution of Cd2þ adsorption mechanisms on corn straw biochars, bamboo biochars, and pig manure biochars prepared at 300e700 C. The experiment results are also consistent with our experimental results (Wang et al., 2018a)."

The competitive adsorption from solutions containing all heavy metals. The results showed that the competitive adsorption\ncapacities of the five adsorbents for all heavy metals were lower than noncompetitive adsorption. The presence of coexisting heavy metals decreased the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents as expected. The obtained adsorption order was found to be same under noncompetitive and competitive conditions: Pb2þ> Cd2þ>Hg2þ. The results agreed with previous observations (Park et al., 2016; Tofighy and Mohammadi, 2011). Compared with Pb2þ, Hg2þ and Cd2þ had higher mobility and could be easily substituted and exchanged by other heavy metals. A reasonable explanation for the obtained data is that the hydrated radius of the heavy metals is in the order: Cd2þ (4.26 Å) Hg2þ (4.22 Å)> Pb2þ (4.01 Å) (Kadirvelu et al., 2008). Moreover, Pb2þ has greater affinity for phenolic and carboxylic groups, which are hard Lewis bases. It is due to the different chemical characteristics of Pb2þ (hard Lewis acid), Cd2þ (soft Lewis acid) and Hg2þ (soft Lewis acid). Thus, Pb2þ possesses a relatively higher electronegativity. These factors explained why Pb2þ is preferred to be adsorbed via surface complexation. These results were also proved using DFT calculations (Fig. 7)."

      "text" : "The surface functional groups, especially oxygen-containing functional groups (eCOO-, eCOCe, eC]O, eOH), have strong adsorption capacity with heavy metals, e.g. surface complexation,\nelectrostatic attraction, and ion-exchange. Pb2þ, Cd2þ, Hg2þ, Cu2þ, Cr3þ and Al3þ are adsorbed mainly via interactions with surface functional groups (Dong et al., 2013; Inyang et al., 2012). And these effects can be confirmed by the changes of the surface groups before and after adsorptions as our previous publications (Gong et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018a). The surface area and porous\nstructure of the adsorbents also influence the adsorption of heavy metals. However, these properties seem to have a weaker influence on heavy metals adsorption than oxygen-containing functional groups (Dong et al., 2013). Thus, the effects of carbonaceous materials’ different oxygen-containing functional groups on Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Hg2þ (M2þ) were explored with DFT studies. The simplified structure segment for the DFT calculation is shown in Fig. 7. Carboxyl, ether, aldehyde or ketone, and hydroxyl were selected during calculation. For the hydrogen in carboxyl on carbonaceous materials (CMs) was dissociated at experimental pH (5.0). The negative binding energy (DE) means that the adsorption\nis an exothermic reaction. And a larger value of DE indicates a stronger binding of M2þ with CMs. As shown in Fig. 7, comparing the CMswith different oxygen-containing functional groups, theDE values of CM-COO- and CMeCOCe were remarkably higher than that of CM-C]O and CM-OH. The binding energies (kcal/mol) of oxygen-containing functional groups to metal ions followed the orders: (ⅰ) CMeCOCePb ( 136.70)> CM-COO--Pb ( 91.58)> CMeCOePb ( 33.57)> CMeOHePb ( 4.69), (ⅱ) CMCOO--Cd ( 45.91)> CMeCOCeCd ( 4.49)> CMeOHeCd ( 3.68)> CMeCOeCd (1.08), (ⅲ) CM-COO--Hg ( 25.51)> CMeCOCeHg ( 3.58)> CMeOHeHg ( 0.63)> CMeCOeHg (0.23). For\nthe COO functional group, the OePb bond in CM-COO--Pb had the shortest bond distance (2.27Å and 2.29Å) comparing with the OeCd bond (2.29Å and 2.30Å) and OeHg bond (2.43Å and 2.44Å) owing to the different binding ofM2þwith CMs. The binding energy of OePb bond was thus much higher than the other two, which indicated Pb2þ with CMs has the stronger binding, and Hg2þ with CMs had the weakest binding energy.\nGenerally, these DFT calculations are consistent with the adsorption results obtained from the adsorption isotherms. The XPS analysis also demonstrated that the amounts of oxygencontaining functional groups of CMs are positively correlated with their adsorption capacities for metal ions (Fig. 2 and Table 2). A large number of surface oxygen-containing functional groups were found to exist on GO, which explained why its adsorption performances for Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Hg2þ were the best among the tested five CMs. As for Pb2þ and Cd2þ, the adsorption capacities of GO were much higher than other CMs. However, while GO possessed much larger amount oxygen-containing functional groups than BC300 and AC (Table 2), they had similar adsorption capacity for Hg2þ. This phenomenon could be explained by the theoretical calculation (Fig. 7). The DE values of Hg2þ with different oxygencontaining functional groups were generally much lower than that of Pb2þ and Cd2þ. Moreover, BC300 and AC have some sulfurcontaining functional groups, which has been proved that they bind readily to Hg2þ (Zeng et al., 2017). For biochar, the increased pyrolysis temperature enhanced the oxidization degree. The XPS analysis indicates that the amounts of CeO (eOH & eCOCe) decreased from 48.57% to 11.13% and eCOO- & eC]O increased to 6.14%. The DFT calculations and the deconvolution of XPS C1s for biochars revealed that the adsorption capacity of BC600 was higher\nthan BC300 for Pb2þ, while the adsorption capacity of BC300 was higher than BC600 for Cd2þ and Hg2þ. The relative binding energy (DDE) of Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Hg2þ adsorbed on different CMs was shown in Table 3. The obtained data revealed that Pb2þ had the strongest binding ability with oxygen-containing functional groups of CMs. And that explained the highest adsorption capacity of Pb2þ onto CMs. It is noteworthy that eCOCe has the highest binding energy for Pb2þ, followed byeCOO-. WhileeCOCe has much lower binding energy for Cd2þ and Hg2þ. The eCOCe has the highest binding energy ( 136.70 kcaL/mol) than other three oxygencontaining functional group. The short OePb bond distance (2.22Å) and the coplanar which is helpful for the adsorption between Pb2þ and CMs in CMeCOCePb lead to the interesting difference. These DFT calculations can be used for the preparation of selective adsorbent for specific contaminant."

      "text" : "Though biochar may increase the sustainability of biofuel production via its positive environmental management, a market and value of biochar has not been established. Shabangu et al. estimated\nthat biochar selling prices above $220 per ton could yield breakeven for some pyrolysis concepts, and the baseline break-even selling price for the biochar is US$ 220 per ton and US$ 280 per ton for pyrolysis at 300 C and 450 C, respectively (Shabangu et al., 2014). According to the estimated price, the price of biochar produced at 600 C is approximately US$ 380 per ton. The price of commercial bamboo activated carbon, multi-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide are about US$ 800 per ton, US$ 105 per ton and US$ 107 per ton, respectively. The cost of adsorption per kg adsorbate is shown in Table S4. Compared to carbon nanomaterials (multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide), traditional engineered carbons (biochar and activated carbon) are more suitable for the removal of metal endocrine disruptors. It is noteworthy that biochar (as by-product of biomass pyrolysis) is a useful strategy for large scale environmental remediation because of its low cost and multiple effect."

      "text" : "Adsorption of Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Hg2þ by BC300, BC600, commercial bamboo AC, commercial CNT, and GO were investigated using batch experiments. A series of characterizations including elemental analysis, BET method, SEM, XPS, and TG/DSC were used to studied the properties of tested CMs. Pb2þ was the most retained cation, followed by Cd2þ. Whereas Hg2þ was the most difficult metal ions to be adsorbed. The surface oxygen-containing functional groups (eCOO-, eCOCe, eC]O, and eOH) have strong adsorption capacity with heavy metals, including surface complexation, electrostatic attraction, and ion-exchange. DFT calculations are consistent with the adsorption results obtained from the adsorption isotherms. The relative binding energy of Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Hg2þ adsorbed on different CMs revealed that Pb2þ had the strongest binding ability with oxygen-containing functional groups of CMs. The competitive adsorption results were found to be same under noncompetitive and competitive conditions: Pb2þ> Cd2þ>Hg2þ. The cost analysis indicated that biochar is a useful strategy for large scale environmental remediation because of its low cost and multiple effect."
