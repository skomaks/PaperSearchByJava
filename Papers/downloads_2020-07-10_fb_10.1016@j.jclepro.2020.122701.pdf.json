Through rheology measurement, the influence of variations in constituents and mixing proportions on the fluidity of fresh concrete can be effectively evaluated. In the case of self-compacting concrete and 3D printed concrete, the user can predict and optimize the flowability of fluid concrete by controlling yield stress and viscosity. The rheology models have been proven to be an efficient tool to predict the fresh properties of cementitious composites. In most cases, fresh concrete follows Bingham’s model. However, the special concrete combined with nano-materials requires certain modifications in the existing models. This paper presents a critical review of applicable rheological models based on flow curves as well as the viscosity equations of dense suspensions employed to characterize the flowability of cementitious materials in general. In addition to the governing variables included in the model formula, this review paper also highlights the effect of cement hydration, temperature, mixing methods, mixing sequence and time, vibration, pressure and air entrainment on rheology. Their respective effects can be potentially reflected and quantitatively evaluated by determining the values of the governing variables accordingly. The summary and discussions presented in this paper provide relevant information and knowledge on the rheological properties of the cementitious matrix with and without nano-modification and promote further research.\nKeywords: 3D printed concrete, Rheology models, Digitally fabricated concrete; Viscosity; Yield stress; Nano-materials; Multi layered concrete ___________________________________________________________________________\nContents\n1.

Introduction\nCement concrete is a concentrated suspension containing solid aggregates suspended in a viscous liquid of cement paste. Cement paste is considered a non-uniform fluid and composed of cement grains distributed in the water. Concrete has complex fluid properties because of its ingredients size fluctuating from µm to mm [1-3]. The characterization of fresh concrete properties is important because of the impact on casting, consolidation, and forming process, which may affect the strength of hardened concrete in the long term. For instance, unsuitable consistency and workability may lead to honey combing and segregation problems. Therefore, for fresh concrete, it is necessary to have good rheological properties during pumping and casting. Various terms like pumpability, consistency, workability, compactability, mobility and finishability have been used in past to characterize the fresh properties of concrete [4]. However, these methods were empirical methods based on qualitative analysis and give only one value. The most famous tests to determine the fresh properties of concrete are flow /spread table test, slump test, V-funnel and L-box test. However, these tests were found of high sensitivity since a minor variation during execution may produce different results [5]. Therefore, it became necessary to develop methods to characterize the properties of fresh concrete by physical quantities.\nRheology is a term in relation to the deformation and flow of matter under applied stresses and shear rates. Bingham first proposed the term “Rheology” in 1920. The flowability of fresh concrete can be better explained in terms of flow curves, relating yield stress, shear rate and plastic viscosity. These fresh state properties of concrete can be quantitatively and objectively evaluated using rheology parameters. The properties like flowability (inter-particle friction, cohesion and viscosity), compactability (density and particles packing) and stability (bleeding, segregation) of fresh concrete is correlated with rheology [6].\nFerraris et al. [7] observed that the segregation, pumping pressure, surface finish quality and formwork pressure are correlated with rheological properties of fresh concrete. It was also noticed that the reduction in plastic viscosity may decrease the formwork pressure but enhance the segregation risk at the same time [8]. Similarly, the increase in yield stress leads to stiff concrete increasing pumping pressure. Therefore, an adequate combination of rheological parameters is necessary to achieve a good surface finish, without segregation and with minimal pumping pressure. Yen et al. [9] stated that the workability of high-performance concrete can be efficiently evaluated by rheological parameters rather than slump flow tests. Roussel and Perrot [10-12] noticed that the thixotropy of cement paste may reduce the formwork pressure, and this phenomenon of structural built up is beneficial in case of multilayer casting.\n3\nThe impact of rheology parameters and flow rate on pumping pressure varies from normal vibrated concrete to self-compacted concrete [13]. In past, several empirical tests have been employed to relate fresh properties with measured quantities. Rheometer tests and various models were presented to simulate concrete flow. Rheometers are considered better as they provide physical quantitates correlated with fundamental flow behaviour of concrete. These values can significantly predict the flowability of fresh concrete for various applications like 3D printing and selfcompacting concrete. Modelling of concrete is performed to predict the flow behaviour more accurately from its composition as it gives more accurate values once fully developed [14]. The models based on the composition used in the past were found with limitations due to one or more reasons. A few of them were found indirectly related to the rheological measurements because of the limitations of measuring equipment. Some give only one parameter, which is inadequate to predict the flow of fresh concrete. Also, the effects of nano-composites or aggregate properties such as surface texture, size and shape were not taken into consideration in several models [15]. A critical review of these flow models employed for the prediction of the flow behaviour of cementitious materials is presented in the current study.\nIn recent years, the application of nano-materials in concrete to achieve the modified properties has vastly been increased. Particularly, the addition of nano-materials in concrete is used to control the material behaviour and achieve enhanced mechanical and durability properties [16]. However, certain novel properties such as self-healing, self-sensing, self-cleaning and electrical resistivity have been achieved using carbon nano-tubes, nano-graphene oxide, nano alumina, nano-titania and nano iron oxide [17]. The addition of nano-materials in cementitious materials can significantly increase the hydration rate, providing additional nucleation sites for the precipitation and growth of calcium silicate hydrate gel. The modified hydration products are responsible for the enhanced durability and mechanical properties [18]. The water demand, therefore, increases due to the high specific surface area and the overall workability of matrix reduces. To enhance the workability and rheological properties of the printed concrete, suitable dosages of super plasticizers are applied.\nThis paper is organized in a way to present the discussion and a critical review of some of the published results on the general rheology models to predict the flow behaviour of concrete and viscosity equations for the evolution of fluidity of concentrated suspension. Moreover, secondary influencing factors affecting rheology of cementitious composites other than constituents such as mixing sequence, cement hydration, temperature and fineness of cement particles, and vibration of the normal concrete during and after casting are discussed in the current review. Finally, the effect of nano-materials on the rheological properties and models used to predict their flow behaviour is discussed.\n2. Rheology Models of Concrete\nRheological models are based on factors such as particle size, density, shear rate, supplementary cementitious materials and chemical admixtures affecting cement paste rheology. Fresh concrete shows a fluid behaviour with yield stress which is the minimum stress required to initiate the flow [1-3, 19]. Initially, the value of shear stress inclines with time without any flow. As long as, steadystate flow approaches, flow curves of fresh concrete follow the Bingham or Hershel Bulkley models. However, yield stress models are found inadequate between two successive steady states to define the fluidity because of the thixotropic nature of cementitious material.\n4\nwhere, τ0 is yield stress, µp is the plastic viscosity, 1/T is structuration term and α is a thixotropic parameter. By assuming the characteristic time of flocculation is greater than the characteristic time of de-flocculation and after integration Equation (2) becomes\n= (3) Then the yield stress equation will be\n= 1 + + (4) The second term in Equation (4) is related to de-structuration rate. This state is related to the history of flow. During mixing, concrete undergoes through a maximum shear rate. This means that\n5\nflocculation λ and thixotropic apparent yield stress λτ0 will become zero. However, after passing through various steps during casting λ will gain some value according to equation 2. At rest when the shear rate is equal to zero, then apparent yield stress equals to = 1 + = + = + ! \"# (5) where ! \"# = $% . where, τ0(t) shows the time-dependent evolution of yield stress. This model better describes the structuration at rest. However, it does not measure the structuration state for resting time more than one minute [11]. The control of structuration rate is the most important factor in the case of multi-layer casting [11, 26]. The first layer needs to develop a significant amount of yield stress to carry the weight of the upper layers. Also, fast structuration may cause a weak interface bonding between successive layers of a 3D printed concrete [27]. The first layer must be stable to sustain self-weight as well as layers above it. This phenomenon of buildability in 3D printing is dependent particularly on the yield stress. The yield stress developed by the first layer after the resting time Δt, is given by equation 6.\n& = + ! \"#& (6-a) & ' = ()*+, -. (6-\nb)\nwhere Δt is the time of rest for the first layer, V and h are the volume and height of concrete of the second layer, µp is the plastic viscosity and Δtc is critical time after which both layers will not mix [11, 28]. According to Roussel, the yield stress is developed linearly because of flocculation initially and CSH bridges between cement particles during a dormant period lasting for a few minutes [22]. However, Perrot et al. [26] proposed a model to predict and optimize the early structural build-up behaviour of the cementitious materials based on its yield stress evolution. They showed that yield stress grows exponentially with time as illustrated in equation 7. = ! /\"# ' 012, 3⁄ − 1 + , (7) where tc, t rest and τ0,0 denotes the characteristic time adjusted according to the curve, time at rest and yield stress with zero time at rest respectively.\nIn past studies, flow curves have been reported to fit various mathematical models interlinking shear stress and shear rate. Generally, viscoelastic materials need to overcome a certain value of yield stress τ0 to initiate flow. Once the flow starts, stress τ and the shear rate , shows the direct relationship. The slope of this flow curve defines the plastic viscosity which is generally denoted by μp. The flow behaviour of concrete according to the Bingham model is illustrated with the following equations. = + (8) ≥ In past years, various authors have reported their work on the rheology of cementitious materials by using Bingham’s model [29-35]. However, for highly pseudo plastic mixtures, with viscosity modifying admixture (VMA) and supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), the Bingham model gave the least fit for the experimental data (Figure 2), while it was found unsuitable in case of nonlinear part especially in case of shear thickening of SCC [36]. De Larrard et al. also reported a nonlinear curve between torque and rotation speed for thick mixtures, and even Bingham’s model\n6\neven gave negative values for stress, which is practically not possible. Therefore, Bingham’s model was found not suitable to predict the flow properties in the case of nonlinearity [37].\nFigure 2: Different Rheological Behaviours [29]\nTo overcome the weakness of Bingham’s model, Herschel-Bulkley (HB) [38] presented a model by combining both yield stress and power equation to fit the rheological properties of the Bingham’s fluid in nonlinear portion. Mathematically it is represented by equations 9 and 10.\n= 7 8 (9) = + 7 8 (10)\nwhere 7 is the consistency in Pa.sn and n is the power or pseudo-plastic index which shows the deviation from the Bingham’s model. Shear-thickening is the behaviour of fluid whose viscosity increases with shear rate, while viscosity decreases in the case of shear-thinning with shear rate. HB model efficiently describes the shear-thickening behaviour of the cement paste (Figure 2). For shear-thickening, the value of b value is greater than 1 whereas, the value of b less than 1 shows the shear-thinning behaviour [30, 31, 39, 40]. This model significantly describes the flow behaviour of self-compacting concrete. However, as per the investigations by Yahia and Khayat using different grout samples with varying amount of welan gum, and high water reducing admixture (HWRA), the lowest values of yield stress were reported by HB model in shear-thinning as compared to the other rheological models for the same flow data [32]. Feys et al. (2007) correlated this discrepancy with the mathematical formulation. An overestimation of yield stress is obtained at low shear rates, in case of shear thickening. Thus, this model is found inadequate to define the non-linear behaviour of the flow curve [41].\nA Modified Bingham model (MBM) with the additional linear term was introduced to overcome the deficiency of the Herschel–Bulkley model as illustrated in equation 11. The second order term of the shear rate was introduced in MBM to measure the shear-thickening behaviour. As the MBM model was formulated to overcome the discrepancies in both the Bingham model and HB model, therefore, it was found a better description for the non-linear part of the flow curve [42]. = + + 9 : (11) C is the second order parameter and µp is the plastic viscosity. As compared to the HB model, MBM does not have any term containing the variable (b) and does not show any restriction in mathematical formulation for shear thickening or thinning behaviour. A limitation for this model is that the fluid should not possess highly-shear thickening behaviour. Therefore, fitting of the flow data is restrained to a second order polynomial [39, 42, 43].\n7\nIn 1959, Casson postulated an equation relating shear stress to shear strain in the case of suspension [44]. It was supposed that the dispersed particles of certain cohesive strength in suspension flocculate to form a chain like structure. However, in the case of highly concentrated suspensions, it does not predict the interaction between the chain structures [35, 45]. The mathematical form of the Casson model is shown in equation 12. It has two adjustable parameters which can efficiently estimate the viscosity at high shear rates [21, 31, 35, 46]. However, the Casson model was found to be the least fit as compared with the Bingham, HB and modified Bingham during investigating rheological properties of the graphene based nano-materials [30].\n√ = < + < (12) In 1936, Eyring proposed an equation with two adjustable variables to study the flow behaviour of simple fluids. Later on, this model was extended to suspension fluids [31, 46]. In 1998, Papo found Eyring’s model as the least fit for experimental data compared to the other rheological models for cement paste with water to cement ratio (w/c) 0.34 to 0.42 [35]. Mathematically, this model is illustrated in Equation (13). = 7=>?ℎ A (13) Moreover, Eyring's model does not explicitly provide yield stress value.\nVom Berg (1979) presented a new model with three adjustable parameters including yield stress and two other constants. The mathematical form of this model is given by the following equation 14. = + A=>?ℎ /B (14) where, b and c are two constants.\nThis equation was originally derived to investigate the effect of cement suspensions and cement particle-size distribution on the rheological properties of cement paste corresponding to w/c ratio of 0.40 to 0.80 [6, 31, 35]. Atzeni et al. (1985) used this model for investigating the rheological investigations on ordinary Portland cement grouts at lower w/c ratio and compared the results with other models. However, results were satisfactory at low shear rates only. Therefore, to overcome this weakness, Atzeni et al. coupled Eyring and Vom Berg’s model and presented a model with four parameters containing both linear and yield value terms as expressed in equation 15 [46]. However, the calculation of the four parameters may lead to complexity. = + C + A=>?ℎ /B (15) The Williamson model (1929) was formulated with three adjustable parameters.\n= C + D E ſ (16) where ∞denotes the viscosity at very high shear rates, τf is the intercept of the asymptote of the flow curve and ſ is the deviation parameter from the Bingham’s model [47]. However, the yield stress does not exist in this model and it follows Bingham fluid behaviour at very high shear rates. Various authors used this model to analyze the rheological behaviour of fresh cement pastes [35, 39, 48]. Sisko (1958) presented his new model with three adjustable parameters. Mathematically it can be expressed by the following expression. = 7 + A ' (17) where a, b and c are adjustable parameters. However, this model does not involve any term defining yield stress [35, 49]. In 1976, Robertson[50] presented an explicit relationship between shear rate\n8\nand volumetric flow rates. This model has three adjustable parameters A, B and C and is given by the following equation: = ! + 9 G (18) This model is very flexible and capable of describing the relationship between shear rate and shear stress for most drilling fluids and cement slurries. When B = 1 and C = 0, the above equation becomes = ! (Newtonian fluid equation) and when B = 0, this model becomes the power law model. Besides, the constant C was found to be related to w/c ratio. However, Papo found this model less accurate than HB model in his work on the rheology of cement pastes [35, 50]. The Robertson-Stiff model was found adequate to describe the shear rate-shear stress data of various viscous drilling fluids and cement slurries [51-53].\nViscosity is an important parameter to understand the flow of fresh concrete. Specifically, in the case of SCC where the viscosity of the mixture is necessary to avoid segregation of course aggregates from the cement paste. Several phenomenological and fundamental models to predict the viscosity of concrete based on its composition have been reported in past. However, few attempts have been successful due to the limited consideration of particle size and their interactions in case of concrete. As the addition of nano-materials enhances the viscosity of cementitious suspensions, a review of the proposed models to evaluate the plastic viscosity of fresh concrete and concentrated suspensions is provided in this part. Einstein’s equation shown below provided the base for prediction of viscosity. = I 1 + 2.5∅ (19) where, and s represents the viscosity of suspension and solvent respectively. This equation gives clear viscosity values for any dilute suspension but predicts the underestimated values of viscosity for the concentrated suspensions. Also, no particle interaction was considered in this formulation. [54].\nFerraris and de Larrard postulated an equation based on plastics viscosity which is a function of the ratio of packing density (φ) to the maximum packing density of the whole mixture (φmax).\n9\nAfter regression analysis, it is expressed in Equation (20).\n= NO P26.75 × T UUVWX − 0.7448\\ ] (20) However, the boundaries for φ, φmax were not clearly defined in this model and may lead to inaccurate predictions for plastic viscosity [55]. Murata and Kikukawa [56] formulated their model to predict the plastic viscosity of concrete based on Roscoe’s equation [57]. This model considered irregularity in shape and size of the particles but neglected any physical and chemical interactions between the cement particles and water.\n> ^ = \"_\"_% `1 − \"a 9b \"c\n(21)\nwhere ik = ik1 i φ + ik2, 1k1 and 1k2 are constants found by regression analysis. If superscript “i” is set equal to 1, it denotes cement paste. Therefore, 1ηr is the relative plastic viscosity of cement paste, 1 η0 is the plastic viscosity of water and 1 φ is the volumetric fraction of cement particles. 1C and 1k are the percentage of the absolute volume of cement and the coefficient of flocculated cement particles respectively. Krieger–Dougherty (1959) proposed an equation for the viscosity of a dispersed suspension (no particles interaction).\nd d3 = e1 − UUfg.h idjUfg.\n(22)\nwhere, η and ηc show the apparent viscosity of the suspension and liquid phase respectively. [η] denotes the intrinsic viscosity of the suspension, φ is packing density of solids and φmax is the maximum concentration of solids by volume, depending upon on the particle-size distribution and shape [58]. Cement pastes have a high capability for flocculation [entraps the water in flocculates, thus changing the overall solid volume fraction]. Addition of nano clay enhances the degree of flocculation and lowers the φmax values. This equation is still suitable to predict the viscosity of cement pastes although parameters in equation 22 differ in physical meaning for flocculated particles. [59].\nKawashima et al. examined the behaviour of nano clay on flocculation of cement particles by using Krieger–Dougherty viscosity equation [60, 61]. The viscosity increases with an increase in the concentration of solid particles in a suspension, while it gives the correct analytical expression with the least concentration as shown in Figure 3. This represents the strength of Krieger-Dougherty model. Hu and de Larrard [62] incorporated both theories of Krieger–Dougherty [58] and Farris [63] to simulate the flow equation for high performance concrete (HPC).

      "text" : "The hydration of C3S is mainly responsible for the binding properties of cement as C-S-H is very fine and highly cohesive in structure [70, 71]. At the initial stages of hydration, precipitation of CS-H leads to an increase in thixotropy of the cement paste because of the formation of bridges between the cement grains [28]. However, after the initial fast exothermic phase, the dormant\n12\nperiod of hydration reactions are considered slow, which causes massive precipitation of C-S-H and results in the general setting and hardening of the cement [72, 73]. C3A is the most reactive phase in cement which is typically present from 5 to 10% by volume of cement and its hydration would lead to the rapid setting of the cement called “flash set” [74]. Therefore, to reach maximum precipitation of C-S-H, the sulphate contents in the OPC needed to be in control. Fresh concrete properties, such as workability, setting time and rheology are directly influenced by the hydration of cementitious materials. Also, the irreversible flocculation in thixotropy is due to the formation of C-S-H bridges between cement particles. Heat evolution during hydration reactions is influenced by the chemical admixtures, concrete mix proportions, and curing conditions [22]. The hydration of cement particles is critically important to be controlled in case of self-compacted concrete (SCC), shotcrete and 3D printing.\nChemical composition and physical characteristics of cement particles significantly affect the rheological properties of the printed concrete [75]. Hope et al.[76] mentioned that the high contents of Al2O3 or C2S in the cement increases the water requirement for hydration reactions, while the addition of a high amount of carbonate or high C3S decreased the water requirement. Mork et al. [77] investigated the impact of gypsum to hemihydrate ratio of cement on rheological behaviour and observed that the yield stress value decreases with the decrease in the ratio of gypsum to hemihydrate for any cement containing high contents of C3A and alkalis. Dils et al. [78] analysed the influence of various chemicals and degree of cement fineness on the rheological properties of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC). The lowest values of workability were observed on the cement containing high C3A, alkali content and fineness.\nWu et al. [79] correlated the plastic viscosity and yield stress with curing time and temperature and observed that the viscosity increases with increase in temperature and hydration progress. With an increase in temperature, the setting of cement is accelerated regardless of the type of retarder [80- 82]. Huang et al. [83] studied the temperature effect on hydration of cement paste blended with various admixtures of nano silica, nano clay, slag, silica fume and fly ash by using static yield growth test. It was concluded that the structural build-up is related to nucleation of C-S-H, which is highly sensitive to temperature. The addition of minerals increases the structural build-up rate at high temperature, especially, nano silica and nano clay have shown a predominant effect in the context of 3D printing [84].\nVom Berg [85] revealed that the yield stress and plastic viscosity of cement paste is correlated with cement fineness and solid concentration. Lee et al. [86] found a decline in values of apparent viscosity with increase in particle size distribution (PSD) of cement/fly ash binder. By examining the relationship between the rheological parameters, particle density and PSDs of cement/fly ash binders, Bentz P. et al.[87] found that these are critical parameters influencing rheological response. Both viscosity and yield stress depend upon the characteristics of the particles used to prepare cement/fly ash binder. Chen et al. [88] mentioned that the influence of superfine cement on rheological properties depends on the water film thickness on the cement particles. With w/c ≥ 0.24, the addition of superfine cement would increase the yield stress and viscosity. However, at w/c ≤ 0.22, the addition of superfine cement would decrease the yield stress and viscosity values."

      "text" : "The rheology of cement paste significantly influences the flow parameters of printed concrete. The cement paste is considered as a suspension of cement particles which can coat aggregates and fill the empty spaces as shown in Figure 5. Past investigations [89] [90] observed a decline in the values of plastic viscosity and yield stress with the increase in paste volume (other than that in gaps\n13\nbetween aggregates) of concrete because excess cement paste lowers the interaction forces between the particles. Su et al. [91] employed this concept in making a new self-compacting concrete (SCC). Oh et al. [92] noticed a certain decline in both the yield stress and plastics viscosity values with an increase in the thickness of cement paste. This thickness of cement paste can be considered as a suitable parameter to determine the consistency of concrete varying with paste concentration [93].

The process of mixing can significantly impact the rheological and microstructure of the fresh concrete. Also, mixing conditions, especially mixer type and mixing sequence significantly impact the flow properties of cementitious materials. The mixing process should be intensive and long enough to break the agglomerates, but care must be taken to hinder the negative effects due to the presence of admixtures or nano-materials [95]. Roy and Asaga [96] observed almost 60% decrease in the plastic viscosity and yield stress in over mixed cement concrete because of the structural breakdown. Furthermore, the width of the hysteresis loop has decreased with severe mixing. Han et al. [97] examined the influence of mixer types on the rheological and microstructure of cement paste samples prepared with varying solid content and w/c and using two types of mixers as per ASTM C 305 [98] (using common paddle mixer) and ASTM C 1738 [99] (using a high shear mixer). An increase in the plastic viscosity values was observed while using ASTM C 1738 protocol, however, even in extended time, viscosity values were found less in samples prepared by using ASTM C305 protocol.\nYang et al. [100] revealed that the mixing methods significantly influence the rheological properties of cement pastes during the first 2 hours. Due to insufficient mixing by hand or paddle mixing, agglomerates of cement powder and cement paste remain unbreakable and are responsible for higher peak values of stresses. Also, a significant amount of cement particles inside the agglomerate remain un-hydrated for a longer time. These clusters are mainly responsible for the defects created in the microstructure of poorly mixed cement paste [100]. The sequence of mixing is also significantly important in terms of rheology [101]. If nano-materials are directly added in mortar or paste, they might form clusters, reducing the workability. Therefore it is necessary to stir nano-\n14\nmaterials with sand or cement or adopt a sonication process to achieve the homogeneity and proper fluidity of the concrete mixture [102].\nThe prolonged mixing of concrete significantly affects and alters its rheological behaviour. This effect is mostly observed (due to continuous agitation) during the hauling of ready-mix concrete to the construction site. However, in most cases, fluidity decreases while rheology of mix increases. Li et al. [103] developed a model by investigating the time dependence of the Bingham parameters. Results showed the increment in the yield stress and viscosity as a function of the time and temperature. However, the addition of an optimal amount of high range of water reducers (HRWR) to concrete along with a prolong agitation time showed an increase in the yield stress while no effect was observed on viscosity [104]. In the case of self-consolidating paste and mortars, prolonged agitation increases the fluidity but disturbs the flocculated structure of mix; thereby reducing the viscosity and stability [105, 106]."

During vibration, the values of yield stress and plastic viscosity can decrease, making concrete prone to segregation. Tattersall and Baker [107] explained that the vibrated concrete, having plastic viscosity and yield stress values, does not follow the Bingham’s flow behaviour. Hu and De Larrad [62] noticed a decline in almost half of the values of yield stress after vibration when compared to un-vibrated concrete, but very less impact on the plastic viscosity. Krstulovic and Juradin [108] and Banfill et al.[109] studied the impact of vibration by comparing vibrational type rheometer with BTRHEOM rheometer. They observed an increase in the workability with the increase in velocity of vibration up to a certain level, above which it is constant. This peak value of workability is correlated with the yield stress of un-vibrated concrete [109]."

      "text" : "Pumping of concrete is the most common way used in the field to transport material from mixer truck to the construction site. During pumping, the pressure is applied to concrete which significantly affects the rheological properties of concrete. However, these changes are dependent on pressure range and mix design of concrete, mortar or slurries in case of drilling wells [110, 111]. Inside the pumps, concrete goes intensive shearing which alters the rheology and workability parameters. These properties change due to power absorption of water by coarse aggregates and temperature effect due to friction [112]. Jang et al. [112] investigated the pressure effect on high strength concrete and found an increase in slump flow; however, the yield stress and viscosity values were decreased. The authors [110] observed the increment in the viscosity and yield stress up to w/c 0.4 with a pressure of 30 MPa. Thereafter, results showed a minimal difference in rheology. Feys et al.[113] concluded, after investigating the effect of pumping pressure on the rheology of SCC, that viscosity decreases with increasing pressure time. However, yield stress may increase or decrease depending upon the superplasticizer content. Significant increase in the yield stress may cause coagulation and increase the in pressure, while decrease in the yield stress leads to segregation in SCC. Similar results of increment in the yield stress and decrease in viscosity after application of pumping pressure were reported by Secrieru et al. [114].\nAir entraining agents are used to provide air bubbles in the concrete to relieve the extra pressure developed by freeze and thaw of concrete. Usually, these bubbles are in the size of 0.1mm to 1mm. Changes in air content or air void significantly affect slump as well as the rheology of cementitious composites. The yield stress increases while the plastic viscosity decreases without high range water\n15\nreducing (HRWR) admixture. However, both plastic viscosity and yield stress increase with an increase in the air content of the cement paste dispersed with HRWR. The hypothesis was explained due to the formation of bubble bridges [115]. While some researchers relate the increase or decrease of yield to the size of the air bubble, small air bubble increases yield stress while large bubbles produce the opposite effect [116].\n5.

NS is incorporated as an additive to improve the overall quality including durability, porosity, and compressive strength of the cementitious matrix. NS enormously affect the hydration kinetics with its high (specific surface area) SSA, which in turn improves the microstructure and promote the pozzolanic activity. During hydration, NS react with Ca(OH)2 and act as a nucleation site for the formation of CSH gel [123-125]. However, it is yet to be established whether the increase in hydration process is due to its chemical reactivity or higher SSA [126].\nSenff et al. [127] observed a significant increase in the hydration process and the reduction in setting time and formation of CSH gel after 9 hours of mixing. It was explained that the addition of minerals with high SSA in cement mixtures increased the water requirement to maintain the\n16\nrequired workability. The increase in friction between the particles and dense packing of NS in the mixture is the reason for an increase in yield stress and viscosity [127-131]. Later on, Senff et al. [132] employed a factorial design approach along with rheometer and flow table test to study the combined effect of nano-silica and nano-titania on the flow properties of mortars. They presented a most effective combination of both nano-materials along with the super plasticizer proportion to achieve significant rheology with compressive strength. However, Pourjavadi et al. identified that the negative impact of NS on flow properties can be reduced by selection of suitable dosages of superabsorbent polymers [133]. Safi et al.[134] also observed the same results. They employed NS in powder form and NS in suspension form in the solution of the superplasticizer and concluded the latter giving the most suitable results for rheological parameters. Wang et al.

In addition to this, NT impart pozzolanic properties when used in cementitious materials [132], while it releases an enormous amount of heat in the initial reactions. Chen et al. observed early peaks of temperature by increasing NT contents [136].\nThe addition of NT in concrete decreases the flowability along with the reduction in the initial and final setting time. However, significant improvement was observed in the mechanical properties with up to 5% addition of NT [137]. Liu et al. [102] compared the workability of mortar containing various percentages of NS and NT and observed that NT had very less effect on the fluidity of the mortar because of having less SSA than NS. Jalal et al. [138] observed the same decreasing trend in flowability of SCC by increasing the NT content.

      "text" : "NC, is a common name among mineral silicates, can be further categorised as bentonite, hectorite, montmorillonite, kaolinite, halloysite, and organically-modified NC, based on their morphology and chemical composition. [139]. NC makes strong bonding with the cementitious materials and increases the rate of hydration and degree of flocculation. The water adsorption property of NC can reduce the amount of free water, thus increasing viscosity and the yield stress [140]. Quanji et al. [141] monitored the degree of flocculation and the rate of hydration of fresh cement paste blended with attapulgite clay. Nano Clays (NC) significantly affects the rheological parameters of 3D printed cementitious materials. Both, hysteresis loop curve and calorimeter tests showed high rates of thixotropy and hydration with attapulgite addition.\nNC has been widely used in SCC to gain early green strength and to reduce the pressure on the formwork. Investigations on the influence of nano clay, fly ash and other admixtures on the SCC and variance of pressure on formwork have been carried out by various researchers. The lowest pressure was obtained by using nano clay less than 1% weight of binders [142-144].\nTregger et al. adapted the multi-structure approach to investigate the influence of micro and nano clays on the early age strength development of concrete. NC in 1% by weight of the binder was found optimal to achieve maximum green strength after casting [145]. Many researchers observed\n17\nthe significant increase in the thixotropy, yield stress and viscosity of cementitious suspensions by incorporating NC up to 3% by weight of cement [146, 147]. Qian and Kawashima [148], and Wang et al. [149] found the 0.5% NC as the most suitable quantity to accelerate the hydration reaction of the aluminium phase. Due to an increase in the viscosity and the rod shape structure of NC, the higher yield stress will be required to initiate the flow. Qian and Schutter [150] investigated the effect of attapulgite nano clay besides with the various percentages of polycarboxylic ether (PCE). Bingham model was found most fit for experimental results to assess the values of the dynamic shear. The thixotropic index was obtained from shear stress vs time graph with a thixotropic model and degree. From the results, it was concluded that the NC increases both dynamic yield stress and the thixotropy of cement pastes.\nIn the case of 3D Concrete printing, NC enhances the shape stability of the printed layers [151]. After comparing diutan gum and NC in 3D concrete printing, Rubio et al. [152] noticed that NC provides better shape stability and the time gap by gaining early green strength without compromising flowability. Panda et al. [153] studied the effect of various percentages of attapulgite clay on the fresh, micro-structural and 3D printability of OPC mixtures blended with high volume fly ash. The rheometer results showed a significant increase in both yield stress and apparent viscosity because of the formation of a dense microstructure (see Figure 7). Also, the degree of flocculation was found high, which indicates NC significantly enhances the buildability and highly suitable in 3D concrete printing. Similar results were achieved by Zhang et al. for rheological behaviour of 3D printed composition with the addition of nano clay [154]."

Luo et al. [157] probed the effect of two types of NA (γ-phase & α-phase) on the hydration products of cement pastes and mortar. Comparative results showed that the NA (γ-phase) particles were finer and formed the cluster together. While NA (α-phase) was uniformly distributed with cement particles, producing better hydration products in the form of C–S–H gel and C–A–H (calcium aluminate hydrate) salts. Ali and Shadi [158] noticed the same accelerated rate of hydration by the calorimeter test. The optimum amount of NA (15nm size) as can be kept 3% as a replacement with cement to form better hydration products.\nSeveral researchers [102, 137, 159-164] investigated the influence of NS, NT, NA, NF and nanoZnO (NZ) on the fluidity of mortars. NS, NF and NA were found significantly lowering the fluidity while NZ and NT have shown very little effect on the fluidity of mortars (Figure 8). Also, slump value was abruptly decreased for a small increase in NA as compared to NS. However, slump loss was negligible in the case of NT. Nazari et al. [159] and Nazari and Rihai [161] stated that concrete blended with 15nm size NA as replacement of cement lost its workability. NA acting as the filler adsorbs free water and become worse with increasing percentages of NA.

Graphene based nano-materials have shown self-sensing properties, which made them widely accepted to detect damages and cracks without any additional equipment [30]. Due to the formation of a strong physical and chemical bond with cement matrix, size effect and filler effect, significant enhancement was observed in compressive and flexure strength respectively [166-168]. However, insufficient dispersion of nano graphene flakes may limit its application. Some authors found the graphene-based sheets cost effective and enhancement in strain-sensing and transport properties [169]. Due to its high SSA, the rate of hydration increases and the sizes of agglomerates of cement particles minimize. These GO-agglomerates can act as nucleation sites with small particle size and large surface area [170, 171].\nWang et al. [172] incorporated different content of GO in cement paste and investigated the GOblended paste for rheological behaviour using the Bingham, the Modified Bingham and the Herschel Bulkley models. The results showed a sharp increase in the flexural and compressive strength, but the fluidity of pastes was decreased to a significant level. The rheometer results indicated that the increasing content of GO increased plastic viscosity and yield stress. However, the inclination was fast in yield stress values. It was also observed by Laser Confocal Scanning Microscopic (LCSM) results that the addition of GO dosage increases the growth of flocculation structures, which are relatively looser than the initial flocculation structures by the cement paste. Similar research [30] was carried out on the rheological and piezo-resistive properties of cement paste blended with various percentages of GO. Four different rheological models were employed to investigate the rheological parameters. Increasing values of yield stress and plastic viscosity were reported with an increase in the GO content. However, these values found decreasing with an increase in super plasticizer content. Also, plastic viscosity was reduced, and yield stress was increased at higher shear rates.\nIt was observed from various studies that the addition of GO enormously reduces the fluidity of cement pastes. However, this effect can be minimized by incorporating a suitable dosage of fly ash blended with the GO. The “ball” effect and less water demand properties of the fly ash make it more suitable to increase the fluidity of GO-cement pastes. Wang et al. [173] showed the applicability of the Bingham model and the Modified Bingham’s model to predict the flow behaviour of cement pastes blended with nano-GO and fly ash. The results found that fly ash can be used as a potential source to increase the fluidity of cement pastes blended with the GO other than increasing the compressive strength. The highest value of fluidity was observed at a combination of 0.01% GO with the addition of 20% fly ash in the cement paste (Figure 10). The Bingham and MBM models successfully predicted the rheological parameters with both combinations of GO. However, an increment in fly ash decreased the interaction of the particles, which resulted in significantly lowering the yield stress and plastic viscosity of GO cement pastes (Figure 11). Shang et al. [174]investigated the effect of silica fume (SF) and GO encapsulated silica fume (GOSF) in cement paste and observed the similar results of reduction in fluidity because of the entrapment of free water when the negatively charged GO interacted with cement. However, fluidity was slightly improved with the addition of SF and GOSF. The hypothesis was explained by the synergetic effect of the surface area of SF and the high surface activity of GO sheets. The Bingham flow model showed a significant increase in the yield stress and plastic viscosity with an increase in the SF and GOSF content (Figure 12). Also, the hysteresis loop was formed in up and down curve, which shows the thixotropic behavior of cement pastes blended with the nano-GO composites.\n20\nFigure 10: Fluidity of Fly Ash cement paste at different time (a) GO 0.01% (b) GO 0.03% [173]\nFigure 11: Effect of different content Fly Ash on Shear stress of cement paste (a) GO 0.01% (b) GO 0.03% [173]\nLi et al. [170] and Gong et al. [175] reported an increase in hydration rate and decrease in the workability of cement paste with the addition of GO. The hypothesis was explained by the formation of calcium cation agglomerates by the chemical cross-linking of GO sheets. These agglomerates entrapped the free water, thus decreasing the fluidity of the matrix. The addition of GO to the cementitious matrix significantly enhances the compressive, flexural and tensile strength with an improvement in microstructure [170]. The combination of GO with silica fume or fly ash; can be effective in maintaining the fluidity to a certain level in 3D printing [176].\n21"

      "text" : "Carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) are made up of graphene sheets, rolled to form specific shapes of tubes or cylinders. CNTs are categorized as single-walled CNT (SWNT) and multi-walled CNT (MWNT). Both types have the same length of about one micrometre but different diameters (1-3nm and 10-40nm respectively) [177]. CNTs are typically one-dimensional cylinders of graphene having a high length to diameter ratio. Through their physical and chemical properties, CNT has achieved high attention to be used in composite materials, catalyst and sensor devices [178, 179].\nDepending on the size and morphology, CNTs have many applications in concrete structures. Researchers reported that CNTs can be used as filler material to improve the microstructure and thereby enhancing the mechanical properties. However, these improvements depend on the length to diameter ratio and dispersion of CNT [180]. It was also reported that CNTs significantly affect the hydration rate. Makar et al. [181] conducted the calorimeter test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) to investigate the effect of hydration on cement paste blended with SWNT at a w/c of 0.5. The SWNT acted as a nucleation site for the C3S hydration product by entrapping free water and reducing fluidity. Some authors [178, 182] reported similar results of an increase in the hydration rate and exothermic peaks. CNTs tend to form agglomerate together due to the Van-der-Waal forces [183] and considerable surface area; thereby reducing the fluidity of the matrix. Insufficient dispersion of MWNT may pose certain issues to the workability of cementitious materials and limit the efficiency of nano-composites [184]. However, the uniform dispersion by sonication [185] or commercially available surfactant may enhance the rheological and mechanical properties significantly. But, some surfactants may adversely affect the cement hydration kinetics by accelerating or retarding the chemical reactions [186].\nNadiv et al. [187] explored the plasticizing effect of Pluronic surfactant, which reduced the viscosity of cement paste blended with CNTs. Collins et al. [188] focussed on the consistency and strength of cement paste blended with CNTs dispersed by employing sonication and various surfactants. The consistency and compressive strength were significantly decreased with an increase in the percentage of CNTs at various w/c ratios. However, the addition of polycarboxylate has shown better result in the dispersion of CNTs in the matrix, while maintaining substantial fluidity followed by the compressive strength. The effect of dispersion as well as various percentages of polycarboxylic ether (PCE) with MWNT on the rheology of cement paste was investigated. Results showed an increase in values of plastic viscosity and a decrease in the yield stress values as the percentage of MWNT increased to 0.25%. Overall, the shear-thinning effect was reported in the cement pastes blended with MWNT. Addition of MWNT may reduce the shear thickening effect of the PCE based cement pastes [189].\nSome researchers like Leonavičius et al. and Kim et al. [190, 191] concluded that the addition of 0.05 to 2% CNT reduces workability and increases the viscosity of cement pastes. The overall time for exothermic reactions could be prolonged with an overall reduction in the temperature. Henceforth, initial and final setting time was increased by increasing the CNT content. Jiang et al. found the Modified Bingham’s model most suitable after regression analysis for investigating the effect of nano-fillers/fibres on the rheology of cement paste. Results showed higher viscosity and yield stress at 0.5% quantity of the CNT with 0.75% of super-plasticizer. Thereafter, a slight increase in CNT and super-plasticizer content has shown a sudden decline in the yield stress and plastic viscosity values [192].\nMendoza et al. [193] achieved a significant increase in yield stress and plastic viscosity by using three different surfactants aqueous for dispersion of MWNT in cement paste. While Maria et al.\n22\n[194] dispersed MWNT by using ultrasonic energy in combination with a dosage of surfactant and achieved efficient rheological results. All these results show the complex behaviour of CNTs on rheological and workability parameters. However, these properties of cementitious based CNTs strongly depend on the quantity and type of CNTs, aspect ratio, surfactant dosage and its type, and dispersion method.\nAddition of nano-materials in cement pastes fastens the hydration rate which significantly affects the rheological properties as well as thixotropy. BM, MBM, and HB models have been successfully employed to predict the flow behaviour and explain the shear-thinning and thickening phenomena of cementitious composites blended with nano-materials. Roussel and Perrot models can be successfully employed to measure the effect on flocculation and de-flocculation phenomenon of cement pastes containing various percentages of nano-materials. This would be, however, beneficial to reduce the segregation and bleeding in SCC and increasing the extrudability and yield strength in the digital fabrication of concrete."

The following recommendations for further research are presented.\n• Many alternative materials such as geopolymers and alkali activated materials have shown a potential to replace cement. These materials possess early setting and hardening properties.

The effect of cement hydration, temperature, mixing methods, mixing time and sequence, pressure, air entrainment and vibration on rheology are carefully analysed. Based on the review of existing studies on the rheology of cementitious composites in general and for the nanocementitious composite, the following conclusions can be drawn.\n• Rheology has been proven an effective indicator to characterize the flow behaviour of cement paste, mortar and concrete and for understanding how they will perform in the fresh state in the practical engineering applications. Such behaviours are very likely to affect the hardened concrete properties.\n23\n• Cement paste exhibits thixotropic nature, where structuration and de-structuration rate has a viable role in the measurement of viscosity and yield stress. The control of structuration rate may reduce the formwork pressure in case of SCC and time gap in case of 3D concrete printing. Perrot model with exponential relation of yield stress has performed better than the others in the evaluation of the structuration rate for the modified concrete particularly in the context of 3D printing. However, Modified Bingham’s model eventually furnishes better results for predicting the flow behaviour of the cementitious nano-composites. Most of the viscosity equations lack one or two parameters like the particle interaction, particles distribution with different shape and size, or maximum packing density. The Krieger– Dougherty equation, however has showed better results with proper consideration of flocculation parameter. • Rheology is significantly influenced by the fineness of cement, methods of mixing, mixing time, sequence of mixing, temperature and humidity during the chemical reactions and casting, packing density of paste, pressure, air entrainment, vibration during and after casting, and by the methods of measuring rheology. • The addition of nano-materials has shown a promising effect on the fresh as well as hardened properties by increasing the hydration rate and improving the microstructure of hydrated products. However, with such a beneficial role, nano-materials such as nano clay and nano silica can amplify the flocculation of printable materials thereby reducing the fluidity of the matrix. Although rheological parameters may be the same for base mixes, the incorporation of nano additives combined with chemical admixtures can affect rheology results differently, depending upon their binder constituents. Specifically, the incorporation of certain polycarboxylate type super plasticizers and dispersion techniques have shown significant effect in improving the workability."

    "abstractText" : "Rheology is an effective and efficient indicator to characterize the flow properties of fresh concrete. Through rheology measurement, the influence of variations in constituents and mixing proportions on the fluidity of fresh concrete can be effectively evaluated. In the case of self-compacting concrete and 3D printed concrete, the user can predict and optimize the flowability of fluid concrete by controlling yield stress and viscosity. The rheology models have been proven to be an efficient tool to predict the fresh properties of cementitious composites. In most cases, fresh concrete follows Bingham’s model. However, the special concrete combined with nano-materials requires certain modifications in the existing models. This paper presents a critical review of applicable rheological models based on flow curves as well as the viscosity equations of dense suspensions employed to characterize the flowability of cementitious materials in general. In addition to the governing variables included in the model formula, this review paper also highlights the effect of cement hydration, temperature, mixing methods, mixing sequence and time, vibration, pressure and air entrainment on rheology. Their respective effects can be potentially reflected and quantitatively evaluated by determining the values of the governing variables accordingly. The summary and discussions presented in this paper provide relevant information and knowledge on the rheological properties of the cementitious matrix with and without nano-modification and promote further research.",
