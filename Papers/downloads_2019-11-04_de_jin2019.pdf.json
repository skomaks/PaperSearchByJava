      "text" : "In the past, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has seriously limited the development of efficient electrochemical devices (such as fuel cells, metal-air batteries, etc.) due to very sluggish reduction kinetics [1–5]. Although the Pt-based catalysts are the most effective catalysts for ORR and have been used in the commercialized fuel cell vehicles, the scarcity of Pt restricts large-scale applications [6–8]. Therefore, finding alternative catalysts with low-cost and high-efficiency is urgent for the widespread use of those electrochemical energy technologies. Carbonbased nanomaterials, especially carbons doped with heteroatoms (N, P, S, Fe, Co), have achieved outstanding catalytic activity (similar to or even better than Pt catalyst) and they have been considered as promising catalysts for ORR in the commercialization of electrochemical devices [9–13].\nCarbon nanomaterials offer the combined advantages of high chemical stability, a good electrical conductivity and high surface area. Therefore, they have became one of the hot topics in energy materials and they have been widely used in lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysts or as catalyst supports [14–20]. Recently,\nWang’s group fabricated a 3D carbon electrocatalyst consisting of defect-enriched nanosheets and polyhedrons by an elegant carbonization method based on sealing NaCl into MOF materials [21]. The resulting non-Pt catalyst reveals a good ORR catalytic performance similar to Pt, and a highly promising discharge performance in zinc-air batteries. Among carbon nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes play a prominent role in electrocatalysis processes due to their unique tubular structure facilitating the transport of electrons and reactants [22–24]. Thiele’s group reported a multi-heteroatom-doped defect-enriched carbon nanotubes based electrocatalyst, which reached a 0.81 V vs. RHE halfwave potential in alkaline ORR tests under rotating disk conditions. This catalyst can reach up to 70% performance compared to that of Pt as a cathode catalyst layer in an anion exchange membrane [25]. In addition, among all kinds of non-noble metal catalysts, heteroatomic Fe, N or S doping is prominent in ORR catalyst development. Recently, Xu and co-workers synthesized an atomically dispersed Fe/N-doped hierarchical carbon architectures that exhibited a slightly better ORR performance than Pt in alkaline conditions [26]. Zhang and co-workers used keratin to prepare S/N codoped graphene-like nanobubble and nanosheet hybrids, which exhibited a very promising ORR ability in\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.03.013 Received 17 December 2018; Received in revised form 26 February 2019; Accepted 2 March 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors. ⁎⁎ Corresponding author at: State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan,\n430070, China.

However, despite all those achievements, the ORR catalyst performance in both alkaline and acidic solutions still needs to be improved. New types of sustainable catalysts must be developed.\nTo further enhance the ORR performance of carbon-based nanomaterials, we designed a novel composite based on a carbon matrix with carbon nanotubes and doping with Fe, N, S atoms. It is known that metal-organic frameworks (MOF) precursors can be converted into a 3D carbon matrix with abundant N sites and transition metal sites after pyrolysis [28–30]. According to our previous work, the addition of Fe ions and hydrazine hydrate during the synthesis process of the MOF precursor could produce carbon nanotubes. Sulfur can be doped into the structure by inclusion of sulfate ions [31]. In addition, hydrazine hydrate, as an alkaline reductant, would not attack ZIF-8, and can therefore be employed to prevent the conversion of divalent iron into acidic trivalent iron which would damage the ZIF-8. However, the\ndirect addition of iron salt and hydrazine hydrate to the MOF precursor usually results in a complete destruction of the 3D framework structure. In this work, as shown in Fig. 1a, we use a facile and manageable impregnation method to prepare an effective combination of carbon matrix/nanotube 3D nanostructure. The first step is to impregnate ZIF-8 with ferrous sulfate solution and hydrazine hydrate, then the carbon matrix/nanotube nanocomposites doped with Fe, N and S (denoted as Fe-N-S CNN) are obtained by a further thermal pyrolysis processing. Compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst, the as-prepared catalyst exhibits a much higher half-wave potential for oxygen reduction under alkaline reaction conditions and a comparable half-wave potential under acidic reaction conditions. The new catalyst also exhibits better stability in methanol solution, long working time durability, and excellent performance in primary zinc-air battery."

      "text" : "Initially, the effects of adding hydrazine hydrate, of different pyrolysis temperatures (800, 900, 1000 °C) and of pyrolysis time (2, 3, 4 h) were explored. An optimized sample (based on electrochemical performance) was prepared by using hydrazine hydrate in the precursor and pyrolysis at 900 °C for 3 h. These initial experimental results are used for later discussion in this work (Fig. S1). The morphologies of the samples before and after pyrolysis are depicted in images obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S2, Fe-ZIF-8 (ZIF-8 impregnated with different amounts of iron salt) maintains the angular octahedral structure with a size similar as that of virgin ZIF-8. This is then, converted into a composite of carbon matrix/nanotube 3D nanostructure after pyrolysis. The yield of carbon nanotubes increases with an increasing amount of iron salt (Fig. S3). In the TEM images (Fig. 1b, c), CN (derived from ZIF-8) perfectly keeps the polyhedral morphology, while carbon matrix and nanotubes can be clearly seen in 6%Fe-N-S CNN (derived from 500mg ZIF-8 impregnated with 30mg iron salts). Carbon nanotubes with 8 nm diameter are embedded in the carbon matrix (Fig. 1d), possibly resulting in a synergistic effect in the catalytic processes. Benefiting from the porous carbon matrix derived from ZIF-8, 6%Fe-N-S CNN shows a high surface area of 974m2 g−1 (Fig. S4). In addition, as shown in the HAADF-STEM mapping images (Fig. 1e), the C, N, O, Fe, and S elements are uniformly distributed on the carbon matrix/nanotube samples."

      "text" : "Before pyrolysis, the diffraction peaks of Fe-ZIF-8 with different iron salt additions are consistent with ZIF-8, indicating that iron impregnation would not change the structure of ZIF-8 (Fig. 2a), which is also demonstrated by the Fourier-transform infrared spectra (Fig. S5). After pyrolysis, Fe-ZIF-8 was completely carbonized into an iron doped carbon-based material, and ICP results reveal that the Fe content indeed changed with different amounts of ferrous sulfate addition (Table S1). As shown in Fig. 2b, when the Fe content is low, there are only two carbon diffraction peaks corresponding to C(002) and C(100), respectively [33,34]. When the Fe content greatly increases, the peaks of iron oxides emerge, demonstrating that higher iron content leads to more iron oxides production in the pyrolysis process. In the Raman spectra (Fig. 2c), all carbonized samples exhibit two peaks indexed as D (1300 cm−1) and G peak (1580 cm−1), representing the defects of the C atom lattice and the in-plane stretching vibration of sp2 bonded carbon atoms, respectively [35,36]. Compared with CN, the increased value of ID/IG in Fe-N-S CNN indicates that the addition of iron increases defects of the as-prepared samples. However, the value of ID/IG gradually decreases with the increase of iron content. This means that carbon atoms are more likely to be present in sp2-bonded form, suggesting that more carbon nanotubes can be produced as the iron content increases, which also can be verified by the SEM images in Fig. S3.\nThe binding situation of carbon can be divided into five peaks, Csp2, C-sp3, CeN, CeO and C]O, which correspond to the position of 284.5 eV, 285 eV, 286.2 eV, 286.6 eV and 288.1 eV, respectively [37,38]. Compared with CN, Fe-N-S CNN shows a pronounced CeN peak, suggesting that iron may promote the formation of CeN bonds (Fig. S6). The ratio of C-sp2/C-sp3 increases with the increase of the iron content (Fig. S7), which is consistent with the Raman results. However,\nas seen from Fig. 2d, the more iron in the product, the less content of CeN bonds, due to the selective cleavage of CeN bond near Fe-Nx, where the CeN cleavage would expose the active sites Fe-Nx to improve the ORR performance [39]. The high-resolution N 1 s spectrum can be fitted into three peaks at 398.2 eV, 400.1 eV and 401.1 eV, corresponding to pyridinic N (pyri-N), pyrrolic N (pyrr-N), and graphitic N (grap-N), respectively (Fig. S8) [40,41]. Pyri-N bonds to two carbon atoms and one sp2 orbital of N is occupied by a pair of lone electrons, which can increase the electron donor of carbon materials to improve the oxygen adsorption capacity and the onset potential [42,43]. Grap-N bonds to three carbon atoms with a lone electron left that can effectively attenuate the oxygen-oxygen bond and accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction, resulting in an enhancement of the limiting current density and electron transfer number for ORR [44,45]. Fig. 2e shows the content changes of pyri-N and grap-N in different products. With the increase of iron content, the changes of pyri-N and grap-N are completely opposite. The increase in grap-N content is due to the increase of carbon nanotubes, while the decrease in pyri-N content is attributed to the fact that the bonds of pyri-N and carbon are the main source of CeN selective cleavage [39]. Therefore, according to the analysis of Fig. 2d, e, 6%Fe-N-S CNN has more exposed Fe-Nx sites and grap-N than 2%Fe-N-S CNN, and more pyri-N than 12%Fe-N-S CNN. In addition, since the catalytic reaction usually occurs preferentially on the surface of the products, the content of surface N and surface Fe would affect the ORR performance. Table S1 gives the contents of surface N and Fe in different samples. The surface N atomic percentage in 6%Fe-N-S CNN (9.65%) is close to 2%Fe-N-S CNN (10.07%), higher than 12%Fe-N-S CNN (8.2%), and the surface Fe atomic percentage in 6%Fe-N-S CNN (1.6%) is very close to 12%Fe-N-S CNN (1.68%), much higher than 2%Fe-N-S CNN (1.37%). Meanwhile, iron oxides on the surface of 12%Fe-N-S CNN could cover some active sites. Therefore, 6% Fe-N-S CNN has the most exposed Fe-Nx active sites for ORR. In terms of the doping with S, based on the Fourier-transform infrared spectra (Fig. S5), the adsorbed SO42− ions on Fe-ZIF-8 were completely decomposed after high temperature pyrolysis. Fig. S9 shows evidence for the formation of doped S in the as-prepared products. The S2p peak can be fitted into thiophene-S (CeSeC, 163.9 eV and 165 eV) and oxidizedS (SOx-C, 167.8 eV) [46,47]. Thiophene-S has been proved to change charge spin density and collaborate with doped N to promote ORR activity [48]. The thiophene-S percent and surface S atomic percentage\nin each sample are displayed in Fig. 2f and Table S1. Compared with 2% Fe-N-S CNN and 12% Fe-N-S CNN, 6%Fe-N-S CNN has the highest content of thiophene-S. Fe2p spectra show that both Fe2+ and Fe3+ exist in all the samples (Fig. S10), and more Fe3+ was generated in the sample with high iron content (Fig. S11), which matches the XRD results well."

      "heading" : "3.3. Electrocatalytic performance",
      "text" : "The electrochemical investigation of ORR performance of Fe-N-S CNN catalyst materials was based on three electrode measurements under rotating disk conditions. In O2-saturated 0.1M KOH solution, data from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) shows that 6%Fe-N-S CNN has a high half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91 V vs. RHE, much better than commercial Pt/C (E1/2= 0.85 V vs. RHE) (Fig. 3a), showing a superior ability for catalyzing the ORR process. To further reveal the ORR process kinetics, four-electron selectivity measurements were performed using a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE). Data from these measurements show that 6%Fe-N-S CNN has a much lower ring current (0.0014mA) than that of commercial Pt/C (0.005mA), which makes it clear that the new nanocomposites have stronger activities for oxygen reduction and peroxide reduction (Fig. 3b). More quantitatively, the H2O2 yield is below 2%, and the electron transfer number (n) is ∼4 on the basis of RRDE data and Koutecky-Levich (K–L) plots (Fig. S12, 13). This indicates that the ORR process catalyzed by 6%Fe-N-S CNN is essentially a pure four-electron process. Furthermore, the calculated Tafel plots in Fig. S14 also show that 6%Fe-N-S CNN exhibits the fastest kinetics. For considering the practicability of cathode catalysts, the durability and methanol tolerance need to be tested. Current-time chronoamperometric responses were recorded for 6%Fe-N-S CNN and for commercial Pt/C at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm. Fig. 3c shows that methanol has no obvious toxic effect on 6%Fe-N-S CNN. In the durability test, the current loss of 6%Fe-N-S CNN is just 5.21% after operation for 12 h, while the current of commercial Pt/C decreases by 29.05% only after 4 h (Fig. 3d). After durability tests, 6%Fe-N-S CNN only shows 3mV negative shift of half-wave potential, which is much small than 25mV negative shift observed for the commercial Pt/C (Fig. S15). These results clearly demonstrate that 6%Fe-N-S CNN has superior durability in alkaline medium, even with methanol addition.\nTo better understand the active sites of 6%Fe-N-S CNN, acid etching\nand SCN− poisoning experiments were carried out (Fig. 3e). With acid etching on 6%Fe-N-S CNN, the half-wave potential decreases slightly, indicating that some acid soluble substances on the surface of 6%Fe-N-S CNN have a positive effect on promoting the ORR activity. Furthermore, using 0.01M KSCN to poison CN and 6%Fe-N-S CNN, the halfwave potential of 6%Fe-N-S CNN drops rapidly, while CN remains unchanged, demonstrating that Fe-Nx sites poisoned by SCN− are the main ORR active sites in 6%Fe-N-S CNN.\nIn O2-saturated 0.5M H2SO4 solution, 6%Fe-N-S CNN shows a comparable ORR activity to commercial Pt/C. LSV plots show that the half-wave potential of 6%Fe-N-S CNN is 0.78 V vs. RHE, which is almost the same as that for commercial Pt/C (E1/2= 0.795 V vs. RHE) (Fig. 3f). H2O2 yields are calculated to be below 1% in the range of 0.2-0.9 V, and n is calculated to be ∼4 based on the RRDE measurements and K–L plots (Fig. S16, 17). Both indicate that the ORR process is still an efficient four-electron path in acidic medium. In comparison with commercial Pt/C, 6%Fe-N-S CNN still keeps its excellent durability and methanol tolerance in acidic media (Fig. S18, 19). These results show that 6%Fe-N-S CNN has an excellent performance, and is superior to most reported non-noble metal ORR catalysts (Table S2). This catalyst even can be effective as a potential candidate as an ORR catalyst to replace commercial Pt/C."

The polarization and power density curves show that 6%Fe-N-S CNN can deliver a much higher peak power density of 132mW cm−2 compared to that for commercial Pt/C (73mW cm-2) (Fig. 4a). When 6%FeN-S CNN is used in all-solid-state zinc-air battery as shown in Fig. 4b, the open-circuit voltage can reach 1.37 V, and three connected batteries can lighten a ˜3.5 V commercial light bulb (Fig. 4c). In addition, 6%FeN-S CNN displays better stability than commercial Pt/C in long time galvanostatic discharge testing under currents of 5mA and 20mA. This catalyst always produces higher voltages than those produced by commercial Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 4d, e). This battery has a high specific capacity of 700mA h g-1 (≈85.4% of theoretical capacity of 820mA h g-1) based on the mass of zinc consumed for complete discharge at\n20mA cm-2 (Fig. S20). Moreover, when 6%Fe-N-S CNN experienced discharge under different current density and for a high current density (2, 5, 10, 20, 50mA cm-2), followed by discharge at 2mA cm-2, the output voltage can remain the same as before, revealing that 6%Fe-N-S CNN has excellent and stable discharge performance (Fig. 4f). The superior zinc-air battery performance can be attributed to the efficient ORR activity and stability of 6%Fe-N-S CNN. These results demonstrate that 6%Fe-N-S CNN may be competitive in various related electrochemical devices."

To design an excellent catalyst, Fe, N and S codoped carbon matrix/ carbon nanotube nanocomposites (Fe-N-S CNN) are prepared by pyrolysis of ZIF-8 impregnated with iron salt in this work. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of carbon matrix and nanotubes, abundant iron nitrides and thiophene-S active sites, the Fe-N-S CNN exhibits an excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance with a half-wave potential of 0.91 V vs. RHE in alkaline conditions and 0.78 V vs. RHE in acidic conditions, while those of commercial Pt/C catalysts are 0.85 V vs. RHE and 0.795 V vs. RHE, respectively. Furthermore, Fe-N-S CNN as the cathode catalyst in a primary zinc-air battery shows a specific capacity of 700mA h g.",
