We synthesized and manufactured a mannose-modified poly (β-amino ester) (PBAE) nano-vaccines with easily tuneable and pH-sensitive characteristics to co-deliver the tumour-associated antigen polypeptide Trp-2 and the TLR4 agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA). To reduce immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, PD-L1 antagonist, was administrated along with PBAE nano-vaccines to delay melanoma development. We found that mannosylated Trp-2 and MPLA-loaded PBAE nano-vaccines can target and mature DCs, consequently boosting antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity against melanoma. The prophylactic study indicates that combination therapy with PD-L1 antagonist further enhanced anti-tumour efficacy by 3.7-fold and prolonged median survival time by 1.6-fold more than free Trp-2/MPLA inoculation.

      "text" : "Methods to exploit the exquisite specificity of the immune system to eliminate tumours\nhave been under development since the start of the 19th century (1). The rise of modern cancer immunotherapy has led to the dawn of tumour cures. Adoptive cell therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and cancer vaccines have been approved in recent years and cancer immunotherapy is now the fourth pillar of cancer therapy (2). Vaccines, which are mainly used for infectious diseases, are gaining attention in cancer research because of its unique therapeutic value. Compared with live attenuated/killed vaccines, vaccines based on subunit antigens, such as recombinant protein or polypeptide antigens, are more attractive owing to their safety, ease of manufacturing and quality control (3-5).\nTumour-associated antigen (TAA) vaccines have beneficial characteristics such as\nconvenient synthesis process, biocompatibility, biodegradation, specific binding property to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules. However, the application of TAA polypeptide vaccines is limited because of their instability, rapid degradation and non-specific distribution in the body. Moreover, because of their relatively weak immunogenicity, polypeptide antigens need to be administered with immunostimulatory adjuvants to promote immune responses (6). Nanotechnology can protect antigens from the biological environment, increase half-life, minimise systemic toxicity, promote tumour antigen to antigen presenting cells (APCs), and trigger the activation of antigen specific T cells (7-9). Tyrosinase related protein-2 (Trp-2) is a tissue differentiation antigen overexpressed on human and mouse melanoma cells, from which peptide sequencing 180-188, a melanoma-associated epitope of the Trp-2, has been widely used as a model\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n4\nantigen for melanoma. Nano-vaccines constructed with Trp-2180-188 demonstrated potent immune bioactivity against melanoma (10-12). Various nanoparticles (NPs), including PLGA NPs (13), erythrocyte membrane-enveloped PLA NPs(14), zinc phosphate NPs (15), calcium phosphate NPs (16), and polyethylenimine (PEI) based cationic micelles (12, 17), have been developed for Trp-2 peptide delivery and can serve as a vaccine for cancer immunotherapy. Poly (β-amino ester) (PBAE), a type of cationic charged biodegradable polymer, is broadly used as delivery systems of chemotherapeutic drugs, proteins, and genes (18-21). Recently, PBAE has been utilized to develop vaccines including mRNA, DNA, and antigen-loaded vaccines because it can stimulate APCs and robust potent immune response in vivo. However, studies on delivery of TAAs or TAA polypeptides via PBAE system are limited. To broaden the application of such kind of a polymer, we synthesized a type of PBAE polymer using a modified monomer combination. Moreover, the polymer structure was modulated for achieving better encapsulation efficiency (EE) of the antigen polypeptide Trp-2. Considering the fact that mannose receptor is highly expressed on APC, especially DCs, we also introduced mannose to modify PBAE with mannosylated terminal parts for DCs targeting (22, 23).\nImmunosuppression within tumour microenvironment leads to anergy of TAA\nimmunotherapy (24, 25). Immune checkpoints are involved in immunosuppression and are overexpressed during tumour progression. Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), one of the overexpressed immunoglobulin superfamily found on cancer cells, combines with PD-1 on T cells surface and can induce a negative regulatory signal to inhibit T cell response. Vaccine activation produces many cytokines to assist anti-tumour immunity. Among them, IFN-γ and\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n5\nTNF-α can both significantly induce PD-L1 expression, which further impairs T cell function. Therefore, the combination of cancer vaccines and PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors has been gradually gaining attention. DC-based vaccines and PD-1 blockade could further amplify anti-tumour T-cell immunity compared with vaccines alone (26). Cancer cell membrane-coated adjuvant nano-vaccines in combination with checkpoint blockade therapy further demonstrated outstanding therapeutic efficacy to treat established tumours (27). These results have confirmed that cancer vaccines combined with PD-1 inhibitors have a stronger potential to promote the therapeutic effect than that of mono-therapy.\nIn this study, we designed a mannose-modified poly (β-amino ester)-stearylamine\n(man-PBAE-S), to co-deliver the melanoma-associated antigen peptide Trp-2 and the immune adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA, a TLR4 agonist) as nano-vaccines (T/M@mPS) to DCs, which presented antigens to T cells, induced their activation and proliferation, and further induced a specific anti-tumour immune response. The cell uptake and maturation of DC were i vestigated in vitro. Subsequently, we explored the biodistribution, immunoresponses, and anti-tumour effects of vaccines in a prophylactic and therapeutic study, and their combined effects with PD-L1 inhibitors in mouse melanoma models."

Quantitative and qualitative detection of cellular uptake were studied via flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate the mannose-mediated targeting of T/M@mPS nano-vaccines. Induction of bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) maturation and cytokine secretion in vitro\nImmature BMDCs were incubated with saline, free T/M, T@PS, T@mPS, T/M@PS,\nT/M@mPS for 24 h at 37 oC. Subsequently, supernatants were collected and levels of IFN-, TNF-α, and IL-12 were determined with ELISA kits. Also, cells treated with different formulations were harvested, marked with APC-labelled anti-CD11c, PE-labelled anti-CD86, FITC-labelled anti-CD80 mAbs and analysed by flow cytometry. Distribution of nano-vaccines in vivo\nDIR, a strong near infrared fluorescent dye, was loaded into T/M@PS and T/M@mPS as\nthe same method above. Free DIR, DIR/T/M@PS and DIR/T/M@mPS were administrated intradermally in the left inguinal region of female C57BL/6 mice with equivalent amount of DIR, respectively. At designated times (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h), the mice of each group were sacrificed and hearts, livers, spleens, lungs, kidneys, and two lymph nodes (LNs) from the inguinal region were harvested and analysed using imaging system (Pearl™ Imager, LICOR, USA). The mean fluorescence intensity of zones in harvested LNs was calculated by the analysis software image studio version 5.2. Anti-tumour immunostimulatory effects of nano-vaccines\nFemale C57 mice (6-8 weeks) were administrated intradermally in the inguinal region\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n7\nwith saline, free T/M, T@mPS, T/M@PS, and T/M@mPS (equivalent dose of 100 μg Trp-2, 10 μg MPLA per mouse) once a week three times. Five days after the last immunisation, mice were sacrificed. Proximal inguinal draining lymph nodes (IDLNs) and distal tumour draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) were harvested immediately. Then the LNs were minced and passed through 40 μm cell strainers to obtain single cell suspensions. Cells were stained with APC-labelled anti-CD11c, PE-labelled anti-CD86, FITC-labelled anti-CD80 mAbs for 30 min at 4 oC, and finally analysed with flow cytometry to determine the proportion of mature DCs.\nThe ability of various formations in CTL activity stimulation in vivo, and the specific\nimmune response towards Trp-2 antigen were detected (detailed in Supplementary data). Prophylactic immunisation of nano-vaccines and combination therapy with PD-L1 antagonist against melanoma\nFemale C57 mice were divided into seven groups and administrated intradermally in the\ninguinal region with saline, free T/M, T@mPS, T/M@PS, T/M@mPS, and T/M@mPS (equivalent dose of 100 μg Trp-2, 10 μg MPLA per mouse) in the first six groups once a week three times before B16F10 tumour challenge. Five days after the final immunisation 5104 B16F10 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in the right front flank of mice in all 7 groups. Nine days after tumour challenge, mice of the last 2 groups (pre-administrated with T/M@mPS and saline) were administrated with PD-L1 antagonist, DPPA-1 (40 μg per mice) (28) peritumourally for seven days successively, which was designed to evaluate the combination therapy of T/M@mPS vaccines and PD-L1 therapy (Figure 5A). The tumour volume and body weight were measured every two days. Survival time of mice was recorded and tumour volume was calculated according to the formula: \uD835\uDC49 = L\uD835\uDC4A2\n2 , where L and W\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n8\nrepresented the length and width of tumors.

At the end of the experiment, tumours were harvested, homogenized, and dissociated with collagenase to obtain single cell suspensions. Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were separated from the cell suspensions using lymphocyte separation medium and stained with PE-Cy5-labelled anti-CD3e, APC-labelled anti-CD4, FITC-labelled anti-CD8a mAbs for 30 min at 4 oC, following analysis by flow cytometry.

Nine days after tumour implantation, different formations were administrated on day 9, 12, 15, 18 and DPPA-1 was daily administrated from day 9 to 16 (Figure 6A). Tumour volume and body weight were measured every two days. At the end of experiment, tumours and main organs were harvested, weighted, and subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. The mice serum was collected to evaluate the in-vivo toxicity of T/M@mPS nano-vaccines. The levels of ALT, AST, LDH, BUN and CRE in serum were measured according to the manufacture's instruction.

      "text" : "In order to investigate the contribution of SA in encapsulating the hydrophobic Trp-2\npeptide, we measured the EE of various PBAE-S copolymers with different SA content from 0 to 18.2%. Interestingly, as shown in Table S1, we found the EE increased from 19.8% to 76.5% with SA content growing from 0 to 18.2%, whereas the differences among the diameter of NPs were minimal. These results suggest that the SA moiety played an important role in increasing hydrophobicity of PBAE polymer, which achieved strong hydrophobic interaction between Trp-2 and PBAE-S. Hence, PBAE-S was adopted as the carrier in subsequent experiments.\nThe DLS results showed that the mean hydrodynamic diameter of blank PBAE-S NPs (PS)\nand T/M@PS was approximately 120 nm and 147 nm, respectively. The increased particle size of T/M@PS might be because of the Trp-2 loading, which entered the core of NPs and expanded the hydrophobic region of the particles. The zeta potential of PS and T/M@PS was 14.5  2.8 mV and 11.0  2.9 mV, respectively. The TEM images also affirmed the spherical shape of PS and T/M@PS (Figure 1A and 1B).\nThe CAC value was calculated using pyrene fluorescence spectrum method (Figure S3).\nThe CAC value of PS was approximately 1.3×10-3 mg/mL, which ensured that the nano-vaccines can maintain structural integrity after injection. pH sensitivity and stability of nano-vaccines\nResponsive properties are of great importance in DC-based vaccine delivery system,\nwhich could help release TAA under the acidic microenvironment of endo/lysosomes (29). To\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n10\ninvestigate the pH sensitivity of NPs, the diameter changes of PS, T/M@PS and T/M@mPS were measured in different pH environments. As shown in Figure 1C, the diameter of PS, T/M@PS, and T/M@mPS remained stable at approximately 150 nm from pH 7.5 to 6.8. When the pH value decreased under 6.8, a continuous and rapid diameter increase was observed, which was caused by the protonation of tertiary amines in PBAE (18, 19).\nMeanwhile, stored in PBS for 7 days, the diameter of each group remained unchanged\nin general (Figure 1D). Both T/M@PS and T/M@mPS have displayed good stability and rapid pH sensitive characteristics. Owing to these basic physicochemical properties, T/M@mPS can be a proper candidate for DC-based anti-tumour vaccine.\nFigure 1. Characterisation of nano-vaccines.

RhB was utilised as a fluorescent probe to study the cellular uptake of T@PS and T@mPS NPs. As shown in Figure 2A, fluorescence images displayed a higher intensity of red fluorescence around the blue nuclei in RhB/M@mPS group than that in RhB/M@PS group. In addition, more RhB was uptaken by DC2.4 cells in both nano-vaccine groups than free RhB. This result was further confirmed by flow cytometry. As depicted in figure 2B and 2C, the mean fluorescence signal in DC2.4 cells incubated with nano-vaccines increased uptake compared with cells treated with free RhB in 1, 2, 4 h, which confirmed that cationic particle formulations were able to promote DCs’ uptake of loaded cargoes (18, 20). Moreover, RhB/M@mPS further increased the red fluorescence intensity by 13.9% and 12.4% compared to RhB/M@PS in 1 and 2 h, respectively (p0.01). This implied that mannosylated nano-vaccines had a better active targeting ability to deliver cargoes into DCs. Maturation and cytokine secretion of BMDCs by stimulation of nano-vaccines in vitro\nAfter stimulating BMDCs with different formations of Trp-2, the expression levels of\nco-stimulators CD86 and CD80 were measured as an index of BMDC maturation (32) (Figure 2D and 2E). The level of CD86+CD80+ in CD11c gates was 21.0% in T/M@PS, much higher\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n12\ncompared with free T/M, which indicated that NP strategy can efficiently deliver Trp-2 and MPLA into BMDCs. Due to the targeted delivery capability, T/M@mPS showed a CD86+CD80+ level of 24.1%, which was 14.8% higher than T/M@PS. In addition, the NPs without adjuvant (T@PS and T@mPS) exhibited a stimulation 2-fold stronger than free T/M. This might cause by the adjuvant effect of cationic PBAE-S material (33,34). We further estimated IFN-，TNF-α and IL-12 secreted by BMDCs after incubated with various formations (Figure 2F, 2G, and 2H). Similarly, T/M@mPS can significantly enhance the secretion of IFN-， TNF-α, and IL-12 than T/M@PS and other formations. T@PS and T@mPS without adjuvant MPLA also showed much more cytokine secretion than free T/M (p0.01). These results show that T/M@mPS can be an effective and feasible strategy to promote BMDCs maturation and then trigger potent acquired immune activation against tumours.\nJournal Pre-proof\n13\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n14\nand after incubation with saline, free T/M, T@PS, T@mPS, T/M@PS, and T/M@mPS for 24 h.

As shown in Figure 3A, compared with free DIR, both PBAE-S NPs revealed statistically stronger fluorescent signal in proximal and distal inguinal LNs, and accumulated in LNs more than liver and other organs (Figures 3C and S4B). These phenomena indicated that PBAE-S nano-vaccines have a potent tendency to accumulate in LNs. It was also found that compared with DIR/T/M@PS, a much stronger fluorescent signal in LNs was tested in DIR/T/M@mPS, which maintained a fluorescent intensity about 1.5-fold higher from 12 to 48 h after intradermal injection (Figure 3B). We further calculated the AUC of these three formations based on fluorescence intensity-time curve. The AUCLNs/AUCliver of DIR, T/M@mPS and T/M@PS was 0.5, 1.3 and 1.5, respectively (Table S2). This result also confirmed that NPs could selectively accumulate in LNs and mannose modification could improve the selectivity of nano-vaccines. In addition, as in vivo living images (Figure S4A) shown, DIR/T/M@mPS migrated faster from the region of injection to distal lymphatic regions than DIR/T/M@PS, which further confirmed the active targeting delivery of DIR/T/M@mPS towards LNs.\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo\nur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n15\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n16\nAnti-tumour immune response of nano-vaccines in vivo\nFlow cytometry was used to determine the proportion of mature DCs in LNs. As shown\nin Figure 4A and 4B, the proportion of CD11c+CD86+ cells in TDLNs treated with T/M@mPS was 5.9%, which was higher than other formations with significant difference (p0.05). Meanwhile, the corresponding proportion of CD11c+CD86+ in IDLNs was 5.6%, which was also highest in all formations. The proportion of CD11c+CD86+ cells vaccinated with T/M@PS was 4.3% in TDLNs, which was much higher than that in free T/M (1.9%). The tendency of CD11c+CD86+ cell proportions in these two vaccinated groups in IDLNs was almost the same (4.1% vs 4.0%). All these were consistent with the results in vitro and confirmed the advantages of NPs system. In addition, the proportion of CD11c+CD86+ cells vaccinated with T/M@PS and T@mPS showed no difference in TDLN and IDLNs. It suggests that cationic polymers can induce an immune response to some extent without immunoadjuvant in accordance with the BMDCs stimulation results above.\nThe ratio of CD8+/CD4+ cells is a crucial criterion for the immune response during\nimmunotherapy (24). The highest ratio of CD8+/CD4+ generated by T/M@mPS in spleen (1.02) was much higher than others (Figure 4C). This phenomenon indicated that T/M@mPS induced potent immunostimulatory efficacy and led to strong CD8 cells proliferation, which up-regulated the ratio of CD8+/CD4+ T cells and brought about more potent CTLs efficacy. The other vaccinated mice also showed a more elevated ratio of CD8+/CD4+ (0.80 in T@mPS, 0.83 in T/M@PS) than free T/M (0.65).\nThe concentration of IFN-, TNF-α, and IL-12 in supernatant after re-stimulation with\nTrp-2 peptide demonstrated levels of Trp-2 specific immune response elicited by various\nJournal Pre-proof\n17\nformations containing Trp-2 peptide. As shown in Figure 4D, 4E, and 4F, T/M@mPS exhibited the highest secretion of IFN-, TNF-α and IL-12. T@mPS and T/M@PS showed a similar level of cytokine secretion, which were both higher than free T/M (p0.001). These results demonstrate that T/M@mPS had the targeting ability to LNs, which consequently stimulates the specific CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell propagation against antigens.\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n18\nat 37 oC in plates, including IFN-, TNF-α, and IL-12. ***p0.001, **p0.01, *p0.05; NS, no significant difference.\nInhibition of B16F10 tumour growth in prophylactic immunisation study\nB16F10 cells were used to establish mouse melanoma model to evaluate the immune\nefficacy of T/M@mPS. Furthermore, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway was overexpressed in immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment and resulted in inactivation and exhaustion of CTLs, which in turn had a negative effect on immune therapies. Owing to this problem, PD-L1 antagonist, DPPA-1, was used to solve the immunosuppression and reinforce the therapeutic effect of nano-vaccines as a combination treatment.\nAs shown in Figure 5B and 5D, free Trp-2 and adjuvant MPLA only showed limited\ntumour recession by 22.02% in volume. However, T/M@mPS showed more tumour inhibition by 62.19% compared to T/M@PS by 48.78% of inhibition ratio (p0.05), which indicated that T/M@mPS can achieve stronger anti-tumour response than T/M@PS vaccine, consistent with results above. Surprisingly, combination therapy of vaccine and DPPA-1 manifested strongest tumour growth inhibition out of all groups with almost 80.85% of inhibition ratio, whereas DPPA-1 therapy alone only revealed 25.45% of tumour regression.\nSurvival rate is one of most important criteria in anti-tumour immune studies (29, 35).\nAs shown in Figure 5E, the median survival time of saline, free T/M, T@mPS, T/M@PS, T/M@mPS, T/M@mPS+ DPPA-1, and DPPA-1 were 20, 22, 24, 27, 30, 36, 22 days, respectively. This result showed that mannose modified PBAE-S vaccine could significantly delay tumour growth and the combination therapy with PD-L1 antagonist strengthened the specific\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n19\nanti-tumour immune efficacy.\nTo estimate whether this immune checkpoint therapy could boost the efficacy of\nanti-tumour vaccine via modulating the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment, we separated the tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in tumor sections after the therapy and the lymphocytes were analysed via flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 5F and 5G, the ratio of CD8+/CD4+ cells in combination group was higher compared with other single therapies which reached the highest CD8+/CD4+ ratio of 1.27 (vs T/M@mPS, p0.05; vs free T/M, p0.001; vs DPPA-1, p0.001). At the same time, single therapy of T/M@mPS manifested higher CD8+/CD4+ ratio than T/M@PS (p0.001), which implied therapeutic benefit of eliciting potent immune response from mannose targeting. An almost identical level of CD8+/CD4+ was found between T@mPS (0.83) and T/M@PS (0.73), and these two ratios were higher than that of free T/M (0.51) (vs T@mPS, p0.001; vs T/M@PS, p0.001). Unfortunately, the single therapy of DPPA-1 failed to exhibit a better increased ratio of CD8+/CD4+ than that of T@mPS and T/M@PS. This may be related to the low immune response found in the majority “immune ignorant” patients (36, 37). Therefore, these results provided an alternative strategy for facilitating the immunotherapeutic efficacy of anti-tumour vaccines through blockading the immune checkpoints in tumour microenvironment.\nJournal Pre-proof\n20\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n21\ndifferent prophylactic groups (n = 8).

Discussion\nPBAE is a hydrolytically degradable cationic polymer widely used as drug delivery carrier,\nincluding mRNA (21, 38), siRNA (39), DNA (40, 41), protein (42, 43), and chemotherapy drugs (19, 44). Because of its endo/lysosomal escape property (18, 45) and significant immunological activity (46, 47), PBAE have been applied for constructing RNA vaccines in the last ten years (42). Since the first tumour-associated antigen MAGE-1 was found (48), TAA has been considered one of most promising antigen to design anti-tumour vaccines (36, 49). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no literature report about TAA or TAA peptide vaccines constructed by PBAE to date. Therefore, we first obtained high EE of a TAA peptide, Trp-2, by adjusting the chemical structure of PBAE. As is known, EE is a key effect in drug delivery systems. The EE of Trp-2 by normal PBAE (synthesised by BDD and TDP) was as low as 19.8%. However, after modifying the structure of the PBAE main chain by inducing 18.2% of SA monomer, the EE of Trp-2 significantly increased to 76.5%. The increased hydrophobic moieties played an important role in the encapsulation of the hydrophobic peptide. DC uptake and LN targeting are other problems to solve for vaccines. Mannose modification is a common strategy to improve nano-vaccines uptake by DCs through the MR receptor (46, 50). The T/M@mPS showed a higher uptake in vitro than T/M@PS. Moreover,\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n24\nT/M@mPS are stable NPs with a diameter of 147 nm, which drain freely to LNs and DCs (51). In vivo, LNs in T/M@mPS group display the strongest fluorescent signal and the MRT0-t was 36.3 h, which facilitates initiation of specific T cell immunity (52). In addition to LNs, high accumulation of T/M@mPS in the liver over the 4-h period was observed (MRT0-t 38.1 h), likely owing to the presence of high levels of mannose receptors (MR) in liver Kupffer cells and high migration ability of T/M@mPS (Figure S5). For mannose-free T/M@PS, liver accumulation started at 8 h and was much weaker than T/M@mPS, indicating the MR-related biodistribution of T/M@mPS. Weak fluorescence in lungs, spleen and kidneys of T/M@mPS might be caused by MR-expressing splenic DCs (53), a non-specific distribution of MR-expressed macrophages (54), and cellular affinity of cationic nanoparticles (55). Briefly, LN delivery was achieved via an mPS-based NP system. The fluorescence AUC of T/M@mPS in LNs was 1.5 times that of the liver, which confirmed the antigen targeted delivery ability of T/M@mPS.\nOwing to the highest accumulation in LNs, the most potent level of immune cell\nactivation and cytokine secretion of DCs was achieved in the T/M@mPS group. Interestingly, owing to enhanced DCs uptake and immunological activity, we found that the mPS-based vaccines without adjuvants (T@mPS) also initiated DC proliferation and cytokine secretion much better than the combination of free TAA and adjuvants, and its efficiency was even equivalent to that of T/M@PS. These results confirmed the intrinsic adjuvanticity of PBAE, which may be induced by activation of toll-like receptor 7/8 signalling (42) or activation of IRF innate inflammatory pathway (33). Because of the advantages mentioned above, T/M@mPS vaccines promoted more specific CTL infiltration and inhibited the melanoma to a\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n25\ngreater extent than other groups in both prophylactic immunisation and therapeutic study.\nSome anti-tumour vaccines have been clinically applied, such as Provenge (29) and\nDepoVax™ (56), but the immune suppressive environment limits the efficacy of vaccines. Combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors is a recommended strategy to overcome this problem (35, 57). We therefore introduced the PD-L1 therapy to increase the efficacy of vaccines. As expected, the combination of T/M@mPS and DPPA-1 achieved higher proliferation of CD8 cells and increased tumour recession than single vaccine therapy by 18.66% in the immunisation study. Meanwhile, the median survival time of combination group was 1.2-fold higher than T/M@mPS and 1.6-fold higher than DPPA-1 along. We speculate that non-response to immune checkpoint inhibitors resulting from the lack of specific effector cells towards tumour might benefit from the specific immune stimulation through vaccine (48, 58, 59).\nAnother major concern is safety. Although high accumulation and long retention time of\nT/M@mPS were observed in the liver, histo-pathology revealed that there was no liver damage in both T/M@mPS- and T/M@mPS+DPPA-1-treated mice. For other organs, such as lungs and kidneys, where accumulation was less and the MRT0-t was shorter (33.2 h for lung and 32.0 h for kidney), no pathological change and/or dysfunction was observed either. No weight loss was observed during treatments. All these results confirmed the high safety levels of our T/M@mPS nano-vaccines.\nIn conclusion, T/M@mPS nano-vaccine system was successfully developed to co-deliver\nadjuvant MPLA and model TAA peptide, Trp-2, to DCs. Owing to the adjuvanticity of PBAE, MPLA-loaded NPs showed synergistic activation against DCs, and thus exhibited strongest\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n26\nability to induce maturation of DCs both in vitro and in vivo. Mannose modification further elevated DCs uptake in vitro and accumulation in LNs in vivo. Therefore, specific T-cell activation was boosted and tumour growth was significantly delayed with prolonged survival time. Moreover, combination of T/M@mPS and PD-L1 therapy could overcome tumour immunosuppression microenvironment, enhance tumour Infiltrating CTLs, and thus achieve synergistic anti-tumour effects. Furthermore, with the help of the massive cancer genome sequencing effort and technology, more tumour-associated peptides are being identified and peptides can be tailored based on various tumours. Owing to the flexibility of chemical structure, various PBAE copolymers can be developed and obtain high encapsulation efficiency of the peptides. DCs-active targeting biodegradable man-PBAE-S has great potential as a nanotechnology platform to design TAA vaccines with benefits to the immunotherapeutic field."
