Introduction\nNanofibers have emerged as exciting one-dimensional (1D) anomaterials for a wide range of research and commercial appliations [1]. Nanofibers show several interesting features, such as a iameter 1000 times smaller than that of human hair, high surace area with tunable porosity, 3D topography, flexible surface unctionalities, and better mechanical properties (i.e., stiffness and ensile strength) that any other commonly used base material [2]. he significant impact of nanofiber technology is due to the availbility of a wide range of materials that can be used for nanofiber roduction, including natural and synthetic polymers, metals and etal oxides, carbon-based, and composite nanomaterials. Furhermore, the nanofiber surface and bulk features can be modified o carry various functionalities, leading to different physical proprties and potential applications [3,4].\nA single, internationally accepted definition of nanomaterials oes not exist. Indeed, they are often designed as nanoparticles NPs), nanotubes, nanofibers, nanowires, or nanorods, in the funcion of their characteristics. According to the British Standards nstitution, a nanomaterial is a material with any external dimenion in the nanoscale (100 nm), or with an internal structure or urface structure at the nanoscale [5]. In NPs, all three external imensions are in the nanoscale. Nanofibers possess two similar xternal dimensions (nanofiber diameter = X or Y) in the nanoscale, hile the third dimension (nanofiber fiber length = Z) is signifiantly larger. There are many nanofiber types [6] and they are ategorized on the basis of their nature (natural and man-made r engineered nanofibers), composition (organic-based, inorganicased, carbon-based, and composite nanofibers), structure (solid, orous, nonporous, hollow, and core–shell) (Fig. 1) and rigidity flexible and stiff) [7].\nDue to their high aspect ratio and ability to form 3D-network tructures, nanofibers are an excellent candidate for various iomedical applications, such as drug delivery, wound healing, nd tissue engineering [1]. On the other hand, most NPs smaller han <100 nm can penetrate the human cells (differently from anofibers), and sometimes destroy the cell components and cause\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30\ncell lysis [8]. Therefore, for safe use, NPs could be loaded onto nanofibers, if such fibers cannot easily penetrate into human cells. However, the nanofiber surface texture (porosity and surface roughness), composition (surface and bulk structure), network structure (random or aligned), and molecular orientation must be controlled to improve their bioactivity [9,10].\nThe many different nanofiber fabrication techniques can be classified in two main types: top-down and bottom-up approaches. In top-down techniques, such as chemical and mechanical treatment of wood pulp, the bulk material is broken down into nanofibers. These techniques are commonly used for the preparation of cellulose nanofibers (CNF) [11]. Bottom-up techniques are commonly used for nanofiber fabrication from constituting molecules and include electrospinning [12], drawing [13], template synthesis, selfassembly and phase separation. Electrospinning is the most widely used method because of its simplicity, low-cost set-up, massproduction potential, and the possibility to control the nanofiber composition, diameter, and orientation in the function of the intended application [14].\nThe production of nanofibers has been already reviewed by many authors; however, a comprehensive overview on the nanofiber technology and development is still lacking. Therefore, here, we will briefly summarize the history and development of nanofiber fabrication techniques (spinning and non-spinning approaches). We will then describe the main categories of nanofiber fabrication techniques and the emerging applications in different fields, such as environmental remediation, healthcare, and biomedical engineering [15–17], energy production and storage [18–20], water treatment [21–28], air filtration, sensors [29–32] and electronics. In each section, we will mention selected studies to explain how nanofibers can be exploited to refine the operational performance of various inorganic, organic, carbon and composite membranes. Finally, we will discuss the challenges for the widespread application of nanofibers. By highlighting the advantages of the nanofiber technology, we hope that researchers and manufacturers will become more interested in these materials and will contribute to broadening their applications.\nA.

History of micro and nanofiber technology\nThe first nanofibers were produced by electrospinning more han four centuries ago. The work by William Gilbert (in 1600) as considered as an early example of what would become the odern electrospinning technology [33]. Gilbert’s study is the first ecord of the electrostatic attraction of a liquid [34]. In 1845, Louis chwabe invented a number of methods for spinning silk and creting artificial fibers [35]. One of the first methods for the synthesis f carbon nanofibers was patented by Hughes and Chambers in 889 [36]. In 1902, the American inventor John Francis Cooley atented the first electrospinning device: “Apparatus for electrially dispersing fluids” [37]. In 1912, Burton and Wiegand analyzed he effect of electricity on streams of water drops, and in 1914 ohn Zeleny studied the behavior of fluid droplets at the end of\netal capillaries [38]. Between 1931 and 1944, Anton Formhals as granted at least 22 patents on electrospinning, including the rst one (in 1934) on the experimental production of fibers [39].\nn 1938, Rozenblum and Petryanov–Sokolov generated electropun fibers that they used to produce filter materials, known as Petryanov filters” [33]. In 1952, Radushkevich and Lukyanovich roduced hollow graphitic carbon fibers [40], and Oberlin, Endo, nd Koyama (1976) developed a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) rocess to fabricate nanoscale carbon fibers [41]. Between 1964 and 969, Geoffrey Ingram Taylor established the theoretical foundaion of electrospinning [42–45]. In 1966, Harold L. Simons patented n instrument to produce fiber fabrics with various patterns [43]. he physicist Lord Rayleigh published several articles (1978–1979) n the influence of electricity on colliding water drops and the quilibrium of liquid conducting masses charged with electricty [46,47]. In 1987, Charles Vernon Boys described the spinning rocess in an article on glass fiber manufacture [48,49]. The modrn term ‘electrospinning’ was popularized by Doshi and Reneker 1995) [50] who produced fibers with a variety of cross-sectional\nshapes from different polymers from 50 nm to 5 m microns in size.\nSince 1995, the number of publications on nanofibers has been increasing exponentially each year. In 2001, Wang used electrospinning to fabricate inorganic fibers [50]. In 2005, the first book on nanofibers (title: “An Introduction to Electrospinning and Nanofibers”) was published by Prof. Seeram Ramakrishna and co-authors [51]. In 2005, the Elmarco company developed NanospiderTM, the first technology in the world to enable the industrial scale production of nanofibers.\nCurrently, more than 200 universities and research institutes worldwide study various aspects of nanofiber production and their characteristics. More and more articles are published on new nanofiber fabrication techniques, and this trend does not seem to decline. Indeed, using the keywords nanofibers, nanofibres, nanofiber or nanofibre, the SciFinder database of chemical literature identified 23,728 articles up to October 2018. About 85% of these articles were published from 2006 to 2018.\n3. Nanofiber fabrication techniques\nTo date, various fabrication techniques to produce nanofibers have been reported in the literature under different names and classifications (Fig. 2). For example, nanofiber fabrication tech-\n4 A.

In top-down approaches, nanofibers are prouced by grinding, refining, sequential cutting, or milling a larger ulk material. In bottom-up approaches, small units (atoms, ions, olecules or NPs) are used to fabricate nanofiber [61]. In this eview, the nanofiber fabrication techniques can be classified in: i) physical, chemical and biological fabrication techniques; and ii) spinning and non-spinning techniques. Spinning techniques an then be subdivided in: (i) electrospinning approaches that use lectric voltage to control the fiber morphology; and (ii) other spin-\nbrous structures on a titanium substrate using femtosecond laser ablation [81].\nning approaches that use other forces, such as pressurized air and centrifugal forces [62].\n3.1. Physical, chemical, and biological fabrication techniques\nVarious physical approaches (grinding, milling, PVD, laser ablation, and spinning fabrication techniques), chemical approaches (electrochemical deposition, CVD, sol–gel, hydrothermal, template-assisted synthesis, sonochemical synthesis, and microwave synthesis), and biological approaches (bacterial cellulose synthesis, enzymatic hydrolysis of wood pulp) to produce nanofibers have been extensively investigated [63]. Physical methods usually apply mechanical pressure, high energy radiations, thermal or electrical energy to form nanofibers by melting, evaporating or condensing the starting material.

Cellulose nanofibers are extracted from cellulose btained from various lignocellulosic fibers using bacteria cellulose nd enzymatic treatment [64–66]. Table 1 shows a comparison etween physical, chemical and biological techniques used to roduce cellulose nanofibers with different size distribution [66].\n.1.1. Mechanical fabrication techniques Grinding, ball milling, cryo-crushing, and high-pressure homognization are physical fabrication methods (top-down approaches) hat are frequently employed for CNF fabrication from natural\naterials, such as wood pulp [66–68]. The nanofiber size and morhology can be modulated by changing the grinding medium and peed, amount of materials, grinding condition (dry or wet) and uration, and amount of energy transferred between the grinding edium and the material [69–71]. Fig. 3 summarizes CNF prouction from wood pulp using the ultrafine grinding and refining echnique. The cellulose mud is put in a super-mass-collider device, n which it is squeezed between a static and a rotating grinding tone [72].\nHowever, these physical methods usually lead to fiber shreding rather than elementary fibril delamination. Moreover, the roduced CNFs are characterized by low polymerization degree, rystallinity and aspect ratio, and consequently relatively poor echanical properties [73]. To overcome these drawbacks, chemial treatments, such as acid hydrolysis, alkaline–acid pretreatment nd oxidation pretreatment, are used before the mechanical proess. These treatments decrease the energy consumption, facilitates he bulk material disintegration, and increase the nanofibril yield 74–77].\n.1.2. Vapor deposition techniques Gas-phase deposition techniques or vapor deposition techiques are widely used bottom-up techniques to produce a wide ange of carbon and metal oxide nanoparticles. Gas-phase depoition techniques, such as PVD and CVD, that recently used to abricate highly structured carbon and metal oxide nanofibers. The\nost common PVD methods are: (i) electron beam evaporation, in hich the material is heated by electron bombardment under high\nacuum and the produced vapor re-condensed to form nanofibers 78]; (ii) plasma sputtering, in which the material is bombarded by low discharge to form a vapor for subsequent nanofiber deposition 79]; (iii) vacuum arc deposition, in which the targeted material s vaporized by the arc under vacuum and then redeposited to orm nanofibers [80]; and (iv) pulsed laser deposition, in which the\nstacked-cup carbon nanofiber helical structure with the inclined orientation of graphene planes along the side of the structure relative to the nanofiber axis [84].\nCopyright 2016, Springer.\nmaterial is evaporated by a high-power laser ablation, and then nanofibers are deposited on a solid substrate (Fig. 4) [81]. PVD has been recently tested for the fabrication of polymeric materials with fiber-like nanostructures [82].\nCVD is typically used to produce carbon nanofibers. Transition metal catalytic particles, such as Fe, Ni, Co, Pt, and Cu, are used with a carbon supply (e.g., CO, or a hydrocarbon gas) at temperatures between 500 and 1200 ◦C to produce carbon nanofibers [83]. The size and shape of the catalyst particle (10–100 nm) determines the size of the carbon nanofiber graphitic structure (Fig. 5) [84]. A faceted nanoparticle with catalytic activity may allow the production of angled layers in which graphitic platelets are deposited at an angle that promotes the carbon nanofiber growth [85]. CVD main drawbacks are the important amount of catalyst residue, the relatively low production yield, and the expensive equipment [86]. Morphological changes of the catalyst NPs must be taken into account to explain the differences in yield.\nNanofibers can also be fabricated using hard or soft templates and vapor deposition techniques. For instance, with atomic layer deposition (Fig. 6), nanofibers are used as a template on which materials are deposited by vapor deposition, and then they are removed. However, it is difficult to completely remove the template without damaging the fibrous structure [62,87]. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) can be considered as one of the most conformal deposition technique at low temperatures. A wide selection of materials has been used as nanostructured templates for ALD growth. Among them, polymer nanofibers are the most widely reported template, which was in general used for the synthesis of oxide nanotubes [87].\n3.1.3. Wet chemical fabrication techniques Electrochemical deposition [88], polyol synthesis [89], phaseseparation [90], microemulsion [91], sol–gel method [92], hydrothermal synthesis [93] are some of the most common wet chemical fabrication methods for nanofiber synthesis. Hard porous templates, such as polycarbonate and anodic aluminum oxide membranes, are often used in combination with electrochemical deposition to produce metallic nanofibers that are aligned after removal of the template scaffold (Fig. 7) [94]. Again, the need for completely removing the template without damaging the fiber structure is the major limitation. Hard templates might be dissolved or polished with a scalpel. Soft templates, such as surfactants and polymers, have been used in combination with electrodeposition techniques for nanofiber synthesis. For example, Nam\n6 A.

[95] prepared Sn nanofibers by cathodic electrodeposition rom an aqueous solution of Triton X-100. Electrochemical techiques offer the possibility to grow nanotubes (100 nm in diameter nd several micrometers long) from a metal and metal oxide urface [96,97].\nHydrothermal synthesis of nanofibers involves chemical reacions in water at different (from room to very high) temperatures nd pressures [98,99]. Cao et al. [100] synthesized SrTiO3/TiO2 anofibers using a simple in situ hydrothermal method. Simpraditan et al. [101] produced titanate nanofibers using a hydrothermal ethod and a natural ilmenite mineral as the starting material. ao et al. [102] described a one-step hydrothermal method for he successful synthesis of WO3 nanofibers (∼100 nm in diameer, and length up to tens of micrometers). The main advantages f hydrothermal methods are the mild reaction conditions and the ood crystallization of the obtained materials.\nmplate synthesis of nanofibrous structures [94].\nThe sol–gel process is a wet chemistry method often used to produce metal oxide NPs, nanofibers, and nanostructured thin films. This method involves the conversion of monomers into a sol (colloidal solution) that acts as the precursor for a gel (an integrated network) of discrete particles or network polymers [103]. Metal alkoxides are typical precursors. The sol–gel method includes two main reaction steps: (i) hydrolysis of the precursor, and then (ii) polycondensation and polymerization of the hydrolyzed products [103]. Polymer/metal oxide nanofibers have been produced by combining the sol–gel and electrospinning techniques [104]. Similarly, polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/silica [105], polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/titanium (IV) oxide [106], PVP/zinc acetate [107], and PVP/aluminum isopropoxide fibers [108], among others, could be fabricated by combining controlled sol–gel synthesis with electrospinning. Calcination of these composite fibers at 500–900 ◦C in the air or inert atmosphere (N2 or Ar) results in pure metal oxide\nMater\no p o t n\na c a n d s u c o v w t ( a r b a\ns p t s c t\nd f s t a m n n\n3\nw o fi m m c ( e n p b m o t f ( a a\n3\nT m\nA. Barhoum et al. / Applied\nr metal oxide/carbon nanofibers without contamination by other hases. Several groups assessed how the nature and concentration f the polymer and metal oxide precursor, calcination temperature, ime, and heating rate influence the phase and size of the as-spun anofibers.\nPhysical fabrication techniques such as ultrasound irradiation nd microwave radiation have been recently employed for wet hemical synthesis of nanofibers [109,110]. These two techniques ccelerate the chemical reactions via completely different mechaisms. Ultrasound irradiation is useful to accelerate the reactant issolution, to increase the reaction rates, and/or to renew the urface of a solid reactant in a variety of reaction systems. The ltrasound irradiation effect in liquids is explained by acoustic avitation through the formation, growth, and implosive collapse f bubbles [111]. On the other hand, microwave radiation proides heat energy to the reactants through molecular interactions ith high-frequency electromagnetic radiation that is faster than he hydrothermal technique [112,113]. For example, polyaniline PANI) nanofibers were chemically prepared by ultrasonic irradited polymerization using various ultrasonic power, frequency, and eaction temperatures [110]. CNFs [114] were isolated from bamoo by microwave liquefaction combined with chemical treatment nd ultrasonic fibrillation.\nThe phase separation technique involves freezing to separate a olution (e.g., an emulsion or a hydrogel solution) [115–117] in the olymer-rich and solvent-rich phases, followed by freeze-drying o remove the moisture and solvent, to form a porous nanofiber tructure (Fig. 8) [118]. The main processing parameters are the oncentration of polymer and solvent, the freeze/drying temperaures, and the presence of cross-linking additives.\nOther physical and chemical fabrication techniques have been escribed in the literature, such as the volatile diffusion method\nor the fabrication of C60 fullerene nanofibers by using toluene as olvent and isopropyl alcohol as precipitation agent [119], and the emplate-free synthesis of polymer nanofibers. Moreover, Kaner nd coworkers [120–123] prepared PANIs by interfacial polyerization or direct mixing polymerization. Then, they produced\nanofibers by inhibiting the secondary growth of the primary PANI anofibers generated in the early reaction steps.\n.2. Fiber spinning: electrospinning and alternative techniques\nSpinning is a century-old technique used to produce textiles in hich fibers of the plant, animal or synthetic origin are drawn\nut and twisted together to form yarn. Spinning can be classied as a physical fabrication technique, and can be combined with ost of the previously described physical and chemical fabrication ethods to produce nanofibers. Fiber spinning techniques can be lassified in electrospinning and alternative spinning techniques also called “non-electrospinning techniques”). Electrospinning mploys electrostatic forces, whereas alternative spinning techiques use other forces (e.g., gravitational forces, centrifugal forces, ressurized air) to produce fibers with a diameter up to 100 nm y manipulating charged threads of polymer solutions or polymer elts. Table 2 and Fig. 9 summarizes some of the specific features f electrospinning and non-electrospinning techniques. In this secion, we will briefly describe the spinning techniques for nanofiber abrication. We will discuss the spinning set-up and parameters solution and processing) that significantly affect fiber morphology, nd the advantages and limitations of the different electrospinning pproaches.\n.2.1. Electrospinning techniques Electrospinning techniques work with polymer solutions [124]. ypically, the polymer is dissolved in a volatile solvent (5–30% polyer: solvent, w:w) and placed in a syringe or pipette. The polymer\nials Today 17 (2019) 1–35 7\nsolution is then pushed at a specific rate through the syringe tip (spinneret) by external pumping using mechanical pistons. The quite high solvent concentration (up to 30%) gives sufficient viscoelastic properties. When the solution droplet is formed at the spinneret, an electric voltage bias (typically 10–40 kV, but up to 100 kV) is generated between the tip (metallic needle) and the collector that is placed at a distance of few cm to few tens of cm. Due to the progressive increase of the applied voltage, the electric forces becomes higher than the surface tension. Consequently, a jet is produced, and the droplet is deformed into an apex (Taylor cone) [125,126]. When the solution feed rate is increased, the electric field strength also should be increased by applying a higher voltage or by decreasing the distance between the syringe tip and the collector [127]. The jet velocity and strain rates can reach values of few m/s and up to 107 s−1, respectively.\nElectrospinning has several advantages: (i) it can be used with all main material types (e.g., polymers, metal oxide, ceramics, carbon, composite) directly or indirectly (i.e., electrospinning of the basic material followed by thermal treatment). More than 200 different polymers have been electrospun for various applications, and the number is still increasing [128]; (ii) nanofibers can be functionalized before spinning (by blending the polymer solution), after spinning (surface functionalization), or by using core–shell electrospinning [3]; (iii) low staring cost, and commercial availability of set-ups for industrial production; (iv) nanofiber can be deposited onto a variety of substrates (metal, glass, microfibrous mat, and water) with lower static charge; (v) different fibrous nanostructures can be constructed in ‘one-pot’; (vi) nanofiber fabrication by electrospinning is easier and cheaper than nanofiber extraction from natural sources (e.g., cellulosic nanofibers), or synthesis (e.g., carbon nanofibers) and with more versatile options.\nGenerally, the fiber diameter, morphology, alignment, and molecular orientation are influenced by the solvent, the collector, the applied voltage, the tip-to-collector distance, and the solution flow rate. Different collector types (e.g., flat piece of metal, rotating disk, rotating drum, or rotating frame collector) have been developed to control fiber orientation (Table 3). Rotating drum collectors are the most commonly used collectors for the continuous production of nanofibers (Fig. 10a–c). Rotating disk collectors are used to produce uniaxially aligned fibers. Compared with a drum collector, a disk collector (Fig. 10d) allows collecting a large number of fibers at the disk edge and making highly aligned nanofibers [129]. By increasing or lowering the applied voltage, the fiber length can be increased, and the fiber size decreased, respectively. The final fiber morphology can be modified from a circular to a flat shape by changing the nozzle-collector distance. Moreover, for aqueous polymer dispersion, a bigger distance is needed to dry the fibers [124].\nWhen choosing an electrospinning approach to fabricate nanofibers from a polymer, the following features must be taken into account: (a) continuous single nanofibers must be collectible; (b) the fiber diameter must be uniform and controllable, and (c) the fiber surface must be defect-free or defect-controllable. The solution must have a minimum concentration and viscosity to produce fibers by electrospinning. At very low concentrations, the solution cannot be electrospun and is electrosprayed. By increasing the syringe flow rate, the fiber diameter is increased, and beads are formed. Beads are obtained also when using a polymer with very low molecular weight while keeping the solution concentration constant. Smooth fibers are produced by increasing the solution molecular weight, and fibers with high diameter are generated when using solutions with very high molecular weight [1]. The surface tension is influenced by the solvent used. A lower surface tension favors the generation of nanofibers without beads, but may not always offer ideal electrospinning conditions. The addition of salts to the electrospinning solution increases the solution conduc-\n8 A.

The applied voltage and the olymer flow rate in the syringe also are crucial factors. At higher oltages, the fiber diameter is more easily reduced, and in some ases, bead formation is more frequently observed. The influence of he tip-collector distance on the fiber morphology is less important ompared with other parameters [125].\nVarious electrospinning techniques have been developed in he last 20 years, such as needless electrospinning, multipleet electrospinning, bubble electrospinning, cylindrical porous ollow tube electrospinning, electroblowing, melt electrospining, coaxial electrospinning, self-bundling electrospinning, charge njection electrospinning, nanospider electrospinning [130–133]. oaxial and tri-axial electrospinning have allowed controlling he nanofiber composition and morphology to form core–shell anofibers using a spinneret with two/three coaxial capillaries\n(Fig. 11). Bi-component and multi-component electrospinning can be used for fabricating multi-component nanofibers. Specifically, multi-component fibers are made of two or more polymers with different chemical nature or physical properties, such as molecular weight. They are electrospun from the same spinneret and are contained within the same filament but separated by fine planes. Bi-component electrospinning can be used to produce nanofibers with different cross-sectional shapes, such as islands-inthe-sea [134], core–shell [7], side-by-side [6], split table pie [129], and eccentric sheath-core structures [7]. Magnetic-field-assisted electrospinning, near-field electrospinning, and hot-melt electrospinning allow good control of nanofiber deposition (i.e., alignment, drawing, and writing) onto different substrates. Magnetic-fieldassisted electrospinning can be used to electrospin materials that respond to a magnetic field. This allows modulating the nanofiber deposition and alignment [135]. Nanofibers fabricated using this\nA. Barhoum et al. / Applied Materials Today 17 (2019) 1–35 9\nt d c t T s\ns t d u T l l [ i fi ( u t m a\nechnique are more uniform and with less splitting than those prouced without magnetic field. Near-field electrospinning set-ups an be adapted to very small needle tip-collector (substrate) disances (from 500 nm to 3 m) with voltages from 100 V to 600 V. his technique is suitable for direct writing on many different subtrates.\nDespite the widespread use and low starting costs of electropinning methods to fabricate nanofibers from polymer solutions, heir mass production is still limited. Several techniques have been eveloped to overcome the low productivity and the need for sing organic solvents of the standard electrospinning methods. hese technologies also include new functions, such as controling the nanofiber morphology, compositing, electrospinning of ow conductivity polymers and high molecular weight polymers 131–139]. The solvent evaporation in the electrospinning solution s still difficult to control, even after the introduction of many modications to the collector. The large mass of the evaporating solvent mainly organic solvents) is the major limitation for commercial se, due to its negative effect on the environment. To overcome his drawback, solvent-free electrospinning methods, such as hot\nelt electrospinning, supercritical CO2-assisted electrospinning, nd UV-curing electrospinning and thermo-curing electrospinning,\nhave been developed (Table 4) [132]. These techniques do not use conventional solvents, nearly all the precursor solution is spun, and only a few precursor fractions (<10%) enter the air via evaporation. Solvent-free electrospinning has been recognized as an eco-friendly process. However, it has not been widely used yet due to the specific set-up requirements due to the relatively higher precursor viscosity. Moreover, the diameter of nanofibers fabricated by solvent-free electrospinning is larger than that of nanofibers obtained by solution electrospinning [132].\nHot-melt electrospinning has a set-up with moving collectors to produce fibrous materials from polymer melts (Fig. 12) [133]. However, melt electrospinning is not frequently used due to the difficulty to produce finer fibers, the higher viscosity of the molten polymer, and the electrical discharge associated with the high voltage applied to the polymeric melt. Supercritical CO2-assisted electrospinning uses supercritical CO2 instead of liquid solvents and can be used to electrospin undissolved bulk polymer samples [132]. Compared with conventional solution electrospinning, supercritical CO2-assisted electrospinning produces very thick (∼100 m) and short (∼4 mm) fibers. Thus, this method needs to be improved to produce thin and long fibers [132].\n10 A.

However, the use of UVurable materials, especially for high specific-surface-area fibers, s limited by oxygen inhibition [138]. A new solvent-free ther-\nal assisted electrospinning process has been developed for the reparation of polyurethane (PU) fibers. Compared with the conentional PU synthesis, the synthesis of the PU precursor solution as improved for use in solvent-free electrospinning [139]. Anion-\nh a sharp pin inside, (f) knife-edged sharp pin with an electrode, and (g) knife-edged\ncuring electrospinning is similar to UV-curing and thermal-curing electrospinning, but the monomer is polymerized via anionic initiators [132]. Polymers are typically added to the monomer solution to control the precursor viscosity. In these methods, almost all the precursor is used for nanofiber production, and less than 10% is lost via evaporation.\nMulti-needle electrospinning was developed to increase the nanofiber production (g/h) compared with single-needle electrospinning [140–142]. For instance, in multi-jet electrospinning, the porous cylindrical tube is filled with a polymer solution and each hole inside the tube produces one jet, forming many fibers at the same time. Needleless electrospinning has been recently developed to overcome the limitations linked to the use of capillaries and needles (Fig. 13) [142]. In this technique, waves of an electrically conductive polymer solution self-organize at the mesoscopic scale and form jets when the electric field intensity is higher than a critical value. Nanospider electrospinning, which is based on a roller electrospinning set-up (power supply, tank, rotating electrode, collector and supporting material), is used for continuous production of nanofiber layers. Specifically, the roller spinning electrode is partially immersed in a tank of the polymer solution and the collector is at the top of the spinner [142].\n3.2.2. Alternative spinning approaches Non-electrospinning (needless spinning) techniques allow fabricating nanofibers starting from much higher precursor concentrations. These techniques require less solvent, increase productivity, and lower the production cost. Blowing bubble spinning (gas-jet spinning), centrifugal spinning, and fiber drawing are three of the most common non-electrospinning nanofiber production techniques.\nDifferently from electrospinning, the drawing technique produces single nanofibers. This method uses a free rotating micropipette spinneret and a substrate for drawing polymer lines on flat substrates. As shown in Fig. 14, a sharp probe tip is used to form polymer droplets. The single nanofibers can be drawn from polymer droplets at a specific rate, in the function of the polymer\nA.

The polymer solution extruded from the micropipette is eposited on the substrate and the movable micropipette spinneret ontacts and pulls the solution to form a single nanofiber. The most ritical processing parameters are the polymer type, the polymer olution concentration and viscosity, the micropipette spinneret onfiguration and rotation movements, and the substrate shape nd micro-movements. The drawing technique major advantages re the possibility of studying individual nanofibers, and the minial demands on the device. The major drawback is that the fibers an be drawn only for a specific amount of time. Indeed, due to sol-\ncreate TE scaffolds which are cell invasive, (k) Melt electrospinning configurations\nvent evaporation, the droplet viscosity progressively increases and the droplet volume decreases over time, thus modifying the fiber diameter [143]. To solve this problem, hollow glass micropipettes are used in which the polymer amount is maintained constant. This offers more flexibility in fiber drawing and in waiting time before drawing, as well as in drawing speed and viscosity. Consequently, fiber drawing can be repeated and the dimensions of the fabricated fibers can be better controlled [144].\nIn centrifugal spinning, nanofibers are fabricated by centrifugal forces, like cotton-candy production. Fig. 15 shows a typical\n12 A.

Centrifugal spinning can pin nanofibers directly from a polymer solution. Typically the ozzle diameter and length are the most important factor for ontrolling the fiber diameter and morphology. Compared with olution electrospinning, centrifugal spinning does not require high oltage, gives high production yields, has a simple structure, is nvironmentally friendly (no pollution), and can be used with high olymer materials. The polymer melts or solutions are fed from an xtruder or a syringe pump into a rotating chamber, consisting of wo or more orifices [145]. When the centrifugal force goes above\ncertain limit (the surface tension and the viscosity of the solution r melt), the polymer jets exit from the orifices, elongate, and the olvent evaporates until the nanofibers reach the collector plane.\nsingle- and double-layer structures obtained using this method [143].\nCopyright @ 2014, American Chemical Society.\nThe main parameters are the chamber angular velocity, the orifice configuration and radius, the solution concentration and viscosity, the melt temperature and viscosity, the solvent evaporation rate, and particularly the orifice-collector distance [146]. If this distance is short, there will not be enough time to allow solvent evaporation F.\nBubbfil spinning employs polymer solutions or polymer melts to produce discontinuous or smooth nanofibers by using blowing air, mechanical or electrostatic forces to overcome the surface tension. Blow bubble spinning, membrane-spinning, and bubbleelectrospinning are the main bubbfil spinning techniques. With\nthat of electrospinning [52]. In blown bubble spinning, a compressed gas (e.g., air, N2) is used as the driving force for fiber formation through a concentric nozzle system, and also facilitates\nA.

The most critical processing paramters are the gas pressure, solution injection rate, nozzle-collector istance, and nozzle configuration and diameter [52]. Bubble elecrospinning and air-jet assisted bubble electrospinning have been eveloped by adding a small electronic field that acts as an actng force for fiber deposition on the collector (Fig. 16b) [147]. This\ntechnique is used for electrospinning high molecular weight polymers that cannot be fabricated with the standard electrospinning set-up because of the high surface tension of their Taylor cone. Melt-blowing is another gas-assisted spinning method that is used for spinning materials with low electrical conductivity or dielectric constant [52,147].\n14 A.

It is suitble for difficult-to-dissolve polymers, such as polyolefins and high olecular weight polymers. Typically, a highly saturated solution f polymer/spin agent (solvent) is decompressed through a spin orice at low temperature and substantially low pressure to generate lexi-filamentary film-fibril strands. The spin agent (solvent) evapration splits the polymer into a fibril. The spin agent should exhibit pecific characteristics: (i) non-solvent to the polymer below its ormal boiling point; (ii) two-phase dispersion with the polymer t low pressure; (iii) formation of a solution with the polymer upon ncrease of the solution pressure; and (iv) vaporization when the ash is released into a low-pressure zone [11].\nMany other non-electrospinning techniques have been escribed in the literature. For instance, laser spinning has een developed to produce ultra-long nanofibers with tailored hemical compositions [148,149]. A high-power laser is used to elt a small volume of precursor materials. Then, the injection f a supersonic gas jet leads to elongation of the molten precuror material and formation of amorphous nanofibers [150,151].\net spinning is based on precipitation, whereby the polymer s drawn through a spinneret into a non-solvent [152,153]. The repared spinning material is extruded in the non-solvent and recipitation or coagulation occurs. This technique can be used to pin materials with low viscosity and that cannot be spun with he other available spinning methods [153]. The islands-in-sea pinning method involves melt spinning a ‘sea’ and an ‘island’ art of the polymer at a speed of 400 to 6000 m/min [134]. Upon issolution and removal of the ‘sea’ polymer from the composite ber, a group of fine fibers is obtained with a thickness from 10 to 000 nm [134]. This technique offers some attractive advantages, uch as high spinneret density and polymer choice flexibility. The ross-sectional area and the number of islands depend on the pinneret hole shape and diameter and the polymer distribution n the distribution plates [134].\n4. Emerging applications of nanofibers\nNanofibers are used in several commercial products. The global market for nanofiber-based products was worth $276.8 million in 2014, and should reach nearly $2.0 billion in 2020 [154]. In this section, we will discuss the current and emerging applications of nanofibers for (i) building materials and constructions (i.e., reinforced polymers, self-healing materials) [155], (ii) energy production, conversion, and storage (i.e., batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells and solar cells) [156,157], (iii) environmental improvement and protection (i.e., ultrahigh air filtration, wastewater treatment, and water purification) [158], (iv) biomedical applications (i.e., drug delivery system, blood purification, tissue engineering, wound healing) [159], and (v) other applications, including defense and security [160]. Fig. 17 summarizes the emerging application of nanofiber in different fields.\n4.1. Reinforcing and self-healing materials\nThe currently available polymeric materials do not meet all the requirements for specific commercial applications. Compared with macrocomposites, nanofiber/polymer nanocomposites display better features (e.g., mechanical strength) and minimal nanofiller loading [155]. The control of size, morphology, and dispersion of nanofiller materials is of crucial importance. Continuous nanofibers display a better interfacial adhesion than conventional fibers due to their large surface-to-volume ratio [161]. Many studies on nanofiber composites have focused on the use of carbon nanofibers for reinforcement material. However, the dispersion of carbon nanofibers into the polymer matrix increases with the increase of the matrix viscosity [162]. To overcome this limitation, new approaches have been developed in which carbon nanofiber sheets (nanosheets), made through the filtration of well-dispersed carbon nanofibers in controlled processing conditions, are integrated\nMater\ni b a t a p c r b\na p t e c t c t ( E t p t p c p i a c h t\n4\nr f c d i i d b p a e c r e s r [ c d r e d s a e d p v c d\nA. Barhoum et al. / Applied\nnto composite laminates in an autoclave. CNFs have replaced caron nanofibers in several applications. Indeed, they show several dvantages, including the abundance of raw material, easy preparaion, and lower cost. Moreover, CNFs can be blended with a polymer t fiber contents up to 70 wt%, while maintaining the polymer transarency (resin matrix) because they do not scatter visible light. The hemical compatibility between CNFs and polymer plays a major ole in the particle dispersion in the matrix and in the adhesion etween phases.\nSelf-healing materials, which can heal in response to damage, re one of the smartest nanofiber applications (Fig. 18). Brittle olymers, such as epoxies (fiber-reinforced), are often used in he automotive, aircraft and aerospace industries [155,163]. Howver, they are particularly susceptible to damage in the form of racks (delamination between layers) deep within the structure, hus making their detection and repair nearly impossible. Typially, core–shell nanofibers are loaded into self-healing materials o store the monomer in the nanofiber core, while the curing agent a trace quantity of a catalyst) is distributed in the matrix [164]. xternal stimuli (heat, light, or pressure damage volume) initiate he monomer polymerization upon contact with the catalyst. In the resence of cracks or delamination in the core–shell nanofibers, he released monomers will polymerize and heal the damage. The orous network structure of electrospun fibers allows the uniform overage of the material with minimal changes in the bulk material roperties. Fang et al. [165] described robust self-healing hydrogels n which a cross-linked nanofiber network containing redox agents cts as the healing layer. When the healing layer is embedded in the rack, it accelerates the self-healing process (50% reduction of the ealing time) with 80% healing efficiency without compromising he mechanical properties [165].\n.2. Nanofibers for energy harvesting and storage\nMuch effort has been focused on the development of enewable energy harvesting and storage devices, such as: (i) ourth-generation photovoltaic solar cells for more efficient and ost-effective use of solar energy [166], (ii) photoelectrochemical evices for water electrolysis to generate H2 and O2 that are used n fuel cells to generate electricity [167], and (iii) flexible batteres and supercapacitors for efficient energy storage by portable evices [168]. Electrospun nanofibers have been used as building locks for optoelectronics and nanoelectronics (e.g., light emitting, hotodetectors, transistors, piezo- and thermoelectric generators, nd actuators) that display low weight, attractive mechanical proprties and good potential for widespread implementation at low ost, and for application in human motion monitoring devices and obotics [169,170]. The current challenges include improving the nergy harvesting and conversion efficiency, energy/power denity, charge and discharge rate, extending the device life with eversibility, and reducing the production and operation costs 171]. Nanofibers have a shorter diffusion path compared with the ommonly employed nanopowder materials; however, they might isplay faster intercalation kinetics due to their high area/mass atio. Several groups have investigated the use of nanofibers as lectrode and membrane materials for flexible batteries, superconuctors, solar cells, and fuel cells [131,172]. Indeed, the nanofiber mall diameter, high surface area, and porous network structure llow the rapid storage of electrolytes and support the long-term lectron/ion transport. The nanofiber flexibility, electrical conuctivity or isolation, and ionic permeability have improved the erformance of new-generation energy storage and energy haresting devices. By modulating the nanofiber properties (bulk ontent, surface texture, porosity, surface functionalization, fiber iameter, etc.), many active sites can be obtained and the large\nials Today 17 (2019) 1–35 15\nvolume changes can be effectively buffered during electrochemical reactions [131].\n4.2.1. Electrode and membrane materials for batteries An electric battery includes one or more cells in which chemical reactions create a flow of electrons in a circuit. All batteries are made of three basic components: one anode (the negative electrode), one cathode (the positive electrode), and one electrolyte that can chemically react with the two electrodes. Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries (Li-S and Li-O2 batteries) are among the most promising battery types. Although they are currently used in many portable and personal electronic devices, their widespread implementation is still hindered by several factors, particularly the limited capacity and efficiency of the electrode materials and their high cost. Therefore, new electrochemically active alternatives are needed with higher energy density and capacity, long life cycle, and reduced costs. Due to their excellent electrochemical performance and their high degree of scalability, carbon and metal oxide nanofibers are ideal candidates for next-generation anodes, for example for electric vehicles [173].\nNovel nanofiber technologies might allow the development of new cathode materials for advanced rechargeable Li-ion batteries. Li-based metal oxide nanofibers are cheap and environmentally friendly material for cathodes in Li-ion batteries [131,174–176]. As metal oxide nanofibers offer a relatively large number of Li-insertion sites, the charge-transfer resistance at the interface between the electrolyte and active electrode materials is reduced. For example, Vu et al. [177] assessed three types of Li1.5MnTiO4+ı (LMTO) electrodes (microparticles, nanoparticles, and nanofibers) for Li-ion batteries (Fig. 19). LMTO nanofibers are constituted of uniformly arranged LMTO NPs that are held together in long fibers (30 m in length and 80 nm in diameter) by the removable polymer network. The morphology of LMTO nanofiber gives a good contact with the electrolyte, longitudinal electron transport, effective Li+ exchange with excellent connectivity between the electronic and ionic components, and shorter diffusion pathways due to the particle nanoscale dimension. PAN and Co(NO3)2·6H2O can be used to produce Co3O4/carbon nanofibers by electrospinning. When Co3O4/carbon nanofibers are used as O2 electrode in Li-O2 batteries, they exhibit a higher initial discharge limit of 760 mAh/g.\nThe anode materials of Li-ion batteries are typically carbonbased (e.g., carbon nanobeads, nanospheres, nanotubes, or nanofibers, and their composites, and graphene) due to its good electrical conductivity and excellent chemical stability (Fig. 20) [178]. Hollow carbon nanofibers are particularly attractive because of their high dimensional flexibility, the high energy density per unit weight, large capacity, high charge/discharge rate, and extended cycle life. Li et al. [179] developed hollow carbon nanofibers with good and durable lithium-storage capability. The anode made of these carbon tubes shows a very good reversible capacity (1635 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 300 cycles, and 1103 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1 after 500 cycles). Due to their excellent electrochemical performance, nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanofibers are a potential anode material for next-generation Li-ion batteries. The hollow structure offers a large electrode/electrolyte interface and a short Li-ion diffusion path [179].\nThe separator (membrane) in the electrochemical cells plays an important role in regulating cell kinetics, preventing electronic contact between electrodes, and maintaining the liquid electrolyte in cells. Consequently, the Li-ion battery performance can be influenced by the choice of the separator. During charging, Li-ions de-intercalate from the Li-based metal oxide cathode, pass through the conductive electrolyte and then intercalate in the carbon-based anode [1,179]. A porous permeable membrane can prevent short circuits resulting from the direct contact between electrodes, and regulate the transfer of Li ions from the cath-\n16 A.

Electrons travel through the external electrical ircuit and interact with Li+ in the electrode. The commercial seprators (e.g., polyolefin membranes) have good chemical stability, uitable thickness, and reasonable mechanical strength. However, heir major limitations (low porosity, poor thermal stability, and oor wettability) lead to high cell resistance, reduced energy denity, and low rechargeability of Li-ion batteries. It was recently eported that polymer nanofiber mats [e.g., polyvinylidene fluoride 180], poly(methyl methacrylate) [181], polyoxyethylene [182] and olyimide (PI) [183]] can be used as separator in Li-ion batteries ue to their low electrolyte leakage, high dimensional flexibility, nd extended cycle life [184]. For example, Wang et al. [92] preared a PI/silica nanofiber membrane by electrospinning (Fig. 21)\neO2 as anode for long-lifespan lithium-ion batteries [178].\nthat showed excellent electrolyte wettability (electrolyte uptake of about 2400%), improved conductivity and thermal stability, and good mechanical flexibility when used as a separator for Li-ion batteries [185].\nThe increasing demand for portable and flexible electronic devices has led to the development of flexible batteries. The nanofiber technology offers new architectural design opportunities for the development of the next-generation, highly flexible energy storage devices. Recently Hu’s group [186] produced a new class of highly flexible batteries, called “h-nanomat cells”, based on the unitized separator/electrode assembly architecture. The “hnanomat cell” includes (i) a binder-free electrode based on netted carbon nanotubes (CNT) and (ii) a cellulose nanofiber separator\nA.

H-nanomat electrochemical execution, shape flexibilty and safety tolerance are much superior compared with those hat can be obtained with conventional batteries. Li et al. [187] eveloped highly flexible Li-ion batteries in which the anode is ade of flexible highly porous carbon nanofibers and the cathode of ommercial LiCoO2 loaded on Al foil (Fig. 22). Thanks to the highly orous carbon nanofibers, these batteries have a high reversible apacity (1780 mAh g−1 after 40 cycles at 50 mA g−1) and very long ycle life (1550 mAh g−1 after 600 cycles at 500 mA g−1).\n.2.2. Electrode and membrane materials for supercapacitors Supercapacitors are energy storage devices with short charg-\nng time, good temperature characteristics, long lifetime, and low nergy consumption. Based on the type of electrode material, upercapacitors are divided into three main categories: (i) elecric double layer capacitors that store energy by adsorption and esorption of ions at the interface between the electrode material nd the electrolyte; (ii) pseudocapacitors in which the electrode aterial actively stores a large amount of charge through rapidly eversible redox reactions (chemical adsorption/desorption); and iii) hybrid capacitors in which one of the electrodes displays\nainly electrochemical capacitance and the other mostly electrotatic capacitance.\nig. 22. Highly porous carbon nanofibers (HPCNFs) for flexible Li-ion batteries: (A) flexib oaded on Al foil as cathode; (B–D) photographs of the flexible battery (B) and of a red LE\nopyright Elsevier, 2015.\nials Today 17 (2019) 1–35 17\nAlthough supercapacitors show excellent cyclability, their low energy density compared with batteries limit their application. Nanofiber electrodes are interesting because their energy density is higher than that of the electrodes used in conventional capacitors. Moreover, they show excellent cycling stability due to their non-faradic and highly reversible energy storage mechanism. The operational voltage is another crucial factor that influences the supercapacitor performance. Therefore, much effort has been put on increasing the energy density by developing nanofiber materials with high surface areas. Carbon nanofibers are particularly suitable because of their homogeneous high surface area, good electrical conductivity, and non-requirement of conductive additives. Carbon fibers have been widely used in flexible and binder-free electrodes with various electrochemically active materials (e.g., noble metals) that display good capacitance performance [188–190]. The performance of carbon nanofiber electrodes has been greatly increased by controlling the nanofiber porosity through the addition of poreforming agents during their preparation. Fan et al. [191] used carbon nanofibers as cathodes and MnO2/graphene as anodes to produce high energy density supercapacitors with superior electrochemical performance (energy density of 51 Wh kg−1, voltage range of 0–1.8 V, and 97% of specific capacitance retained after 1000 cycles).\nFlexible supercapacitors could be used in wearable, miniaturized, portable, large-scale transparent and flexible electronic devices. Electrospinning opens new opportunities for the development of highly flexible supercapacitors. Zhang et al. [192] used electrospinning followed by carbonation in an inert atmosphere to prepare a hierarchical 3D-structure of aligned CNTs that were perpendicularly grown on carbon nanofibers. These highly structured CNTs are very good candidate electrode material for flexible supercapacitors (Fig. 23). When using an ionic liquid electrolyte, the flexible CNT/carbon nanofiber-based supercapacitors deliver high specific energy of 70.7 Wh kg−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 at 30 ◦C, and retain 97% of the initial capacitance even after 20,000 cycles. Huang et al. [193] developed high-performance wearable supercapacitor fabrics, based on flexible nickel–cotton fabrics on which CNT-containing nanofiber webs were directly electrospun without any post-treatment. These wearable supercapacitor fabrics are characterized by the high areal capacitance (973.5 mF cm−2;\nle Li-ion battery in which an HPCNF film is used as anode, and commercial LiCoO2 D powered by the flexible battery in the flat (C) and bent (D) state [187].\n18 A.

For instance, Shen t al. [194] integrated a polypyrrole nanofiber-based microupercapacitor in an energy harvester and other circuits. During he deposition of polypyrrole nanofibers onto the electrodes by ear-field electrospinning, the substrate was fixed on a computerontrolled X–Y motion stage. The prototype shows high capacitance up to 0.48 mF cm−2) and its performance is not modified durng the bend test [194]. Tian et al. developed flexible biner free, elf-supported membranes of carbon nanofibers with embedded - oO3 nanoparticles by using electrospinning followed by thermal arbonation. The developed electrodes showed fast intercalaion pseudocapacitance, high specific capacitance (544 mF cm−2 t 1 mA cm−2) and an excellent cycling stability (106.7% retention fter 20,000 cycles) [131] (Fig. 24).\n.2.3. Membrane and electrode materials for fuel cells A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts chem-\ncal energy from fuel (e.g., O2 and H2) into electricity through he electrochemical reaction of H2 with O2 or another oxidizing gent. There are several types of fuel cells with different characeristics and configurations: proton exchange membrane fuel cells PEMFCs), direct methanol fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells, molten arbonate fuel cells, phosphoric acid fuel cells, and microbial fuel ells (MFCs). Like a battery, in a fuel cell, the anode and cathode re separated by a cation-specific membrane [172]. Fig. 25 shows ifferent types of electrospun nanofibre membranes used electrohemical cell, for example, fuel cell.\nPEMFCs consumes H2 and O2 to produce electricity [195]. The xidation reaction occurs at the anode. H2 loses its electrons, and toms become ionized to form H+. The electrons travel through ires to provide a current to reduce O2 (usually from the air) at the athode. The oxygen and hydrogen ions produced in the electrolyte ombine and form water (H2O) as a by-product that exits the fuel ell. H2 and O2 are separated by a proton exchange membrane to revent their direct contact in the fuel cell. The electrodes used n PEMFCs are made of a thin film of catalyst particles (Pt or Pd n carbon powder) bound to a polymer and with a porous charge ollector for charge transfer [1]. As the Pt-carbon catalyst is the ost expensive component of the fuel cells, electrospun carbon anofibers have been used as an alternative catalyst due to their igh catalytic efficiency and durability, and larger catalyst surface rea for H2 and O2 reactions. The pores between nanofibers in the at electrode facilitate water removal [1].\nally aligned CNTs directly grown on carbon nanofibers (right) and a photograph of\nImplantable glucose fuel cells are a new generation of fuel cells used as an autonomous energy supply for medical implants. They work by oxidizing glucose at the anode, and by reducing the oxidant at the cathode. Due to the ubiquity of glucose and oxygen in the extracellular fluid, they can operate indefinitely [196]. The glucose fuel cells rely on the electrochemical reaction between oxygen and glucose at two separated Pt NP electrodes as a catalyst. As Pt NPs can catalyze glucose oxidation and also oxygen reduction, a membrane is used to avoid the concomitant presence of glucose and oxygen at the two electrodes. Liu et al. [197] recently developed a glucose fuel cell in which a Pt NP/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofiber membrane was the anode and a platinum sheet was the cathode. The combination of BC nanofibers and Pt NP/CNTs in the conductive anode membrane allows glucose oxidation. The electrochemical performance of this glucose fuel cell (2.24 ± 0.20 W cm−2) is close to that of the commercial glucose fuel cell “RANEY ® -type”. This system is a step forward to the development of an implantable glucose sensor targeted to patients with diabetes [198] for accurate automated insulin delivery in response to the local glucose concentration.\nSeveral groups have assessed the value of polymer nanofiber membranes as electrolyte membranes in PEMFCs. The key property of electrolyte membranes is their high proton conductivity and inhibition of electron transport. Protons are transmitted through the electrolyte membrane that contains distilled water, while electrons are transmitted externally. As distilled water is required for proton conductivity, water maintenance in the membrane is crucial. Nanofibers significantly improve the dimensional stability, mechanical properties, and lifetime of proton exchange membranes. Electrospun N-doped Fe/carbon nanofibers are an attractive low-cost catalyst for Pt and are more efficient than traditional carbon-supported catalysts [199]. With this catalyst, the membrane electrode shows volumetric current densities of 0.25, 3.3 and 60 A cm−3 at 0.95, 0.9 and 0.8 ViR-free, respectively [199]. A proton exchange membrane has been developed also for direct methanol fuel cells [200].\nMFC are bio-electrochemical devices that transform organic waste and microbes into electric current. They are cheap, selfsustaining, and adaptable catalysts that could use agricultural residues, urban waste, and industrial wastewater as carbon and energy sources [201]. Research has focused on strategies to increase MFC power output using more electrochemically active microbes. However, most MFCs are not suitable for high electricity production [202]. Recently, carbon nanofibers have been used as an efficient MFC anode due to their high conductivity, stability, and biocompatibility. For instance, Jung and Roh reported that CNT/carbon\nA.

The fabricated fuel cell high power\nmat embedded into a (proton conducting or non-conducting) polymer matrix, (d)\n(0.19 W cm−2), was about 1.7 times higher than that of the reference fuel cell (0.11 W cm−2) at a lower ionic resistance [203].\n4.2.4.

A typical polymer solar cell contains three parts: (i) an anode ade of indium tin oxide modified with PEDOT/polystyrene sulonate; (ii) a cathode (Al electrode); and (iii) a light active layer nserted between the electrodes. Compared with silicon-based olar cells, polymer solar cells are lighter, cheaper, more flexible nd can be directly fabricated into many flexible devices. Conjuated polymer nanofibers are the most promising p-type material or producing flexible polymer solar cells [204]. Sundararajan nd his coworkers [205] employed the coaxial electrospinning echnique to produce organic semiconductor fibers made of poly(3-\ne Nafion infiltrated PVDF-HFP fiber pore space on the GDE is shown and (d) bottom\nhexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)/phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (core) and PVP (shell) that can be used for solar cells (Fig. 27) [205].\nDSSCs are an effective and cheaper substitute for the current p–n junction photovoltaic devices. In a typical DSSC, a porous layer of TiO2 NPs covered with a molecular dye that absorbs sunlight is used as the light absorbing material. As TiO2 NPs have photovoltaic properties but absorb only UV light, dyes are added to increase their efficiency. Spin coating, screen-printing, doctor blading, and CVD have been used to produce porous dyeTiO2 nanofilms on fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO) or indium tin oxide as photoanode for DSCCs. The photoanode (dye-TiO2-FTO) is immersed in an electrolyte solution (I−/I3−), above which is the cathode (glass plate with a thin Pt film as a catalyst) (Fig. 28) [206]. The charge conduction can be increased by replacing the porous TiO2 NPs with porous TiO2 nanofiber mats because the nanofibers have reduced particle boundaries and higher specific surface area that can absorb more sensitizing dyes [207]. Recently, the surface of TiO2 nanofibers has been modified with noble metal NPs (e.g., Ag, Au, Pt) to increase DSCC efficiency by plasmon enhanced optical absorption of such NPs. Jin et al. [208] showed that photoanodes made of TiO2 nanofibers doped with Ag NPs significantly increase DSCC photocurrent density, leading to a conversion\nA.

Environmental improvement and protection\nMany groups have investigated the environmental applicaions of functional nanofibers, for instance for filtration [209], elf-cleaning [210], adsorbents [211], oil-spill cleanup [212] and lectromagnetic shielding [213]. Currently, nanofibers are used in ir and water filters and blood purification membranes to minimize he pressure drop and improve efficiency compared with conven-\nctions) constructed on the flexible plastic substrate and operated under mechanical\ntional fiber mats. The nanofiber large surface area-to-volume ratio increases the area available for contaminant adsorption and the filter lifetime.\n4.3.1. Membrane materials for wastewater treatment Water pollution is a major issue worldwide. It is estimated that more than 50% of countries will experience freshwater stress or shortages by 2025, and 75% by 2075 [214].\nConventional water purification and wastewater treatment membranes include a selective (active) layer supported by a thick non-selective and highly permeable substrate. By controlling the pore size of the active layer, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, and microfiltration membranes can be produced [215]. The traditionally used membranes have intrinsic limitations, such as low flux, susceptibility to fouling, and formation of pinholes during the preparation steps. Nanofiber membranes could replace such membranes in smaller treatment systems that operate at low pressures [216]. The major advantage of nanofiber membranes in wastewater are their ultra-high filtration efficiency [216]. Nanofiber membrane could remove submicron particles (e.g., bacteria, and dust particles) by size exclusion. Conversely, much smaller pores are required for efficient nanoparticle removal (e.g., virus), but this would significantly limit the water flux. This problem can be solved by using multi-layer nanofiber membranes that allow high filter efficiency and increased water throughput. However, it is still challenging to fabricate membranes with wellorganized multilayer structures, starting from the nanoscale, to maximize filtration efficiency [217]. Recently, Ling and coworkers\n22 A. Barhoum et al. / Applied Materials Today 17 (2019) 1–35\nC\n[ F o p\na l n p t t m u h [ f c d p b c t d m\nfi b f p m n t\nAP-rich layer (top view).

The anofiber membrane features could be modulated to obtain high orosity, suitable pore sizes, narrow pore size distribution, and hin thickness coupled with super-hydrophobicity in order to use hen for high-performance wastewater treatment. Some environ-\nental contaminants (e.g., heavy metals) are difficult to eliminate sing conventional water purification strategies [208]. On the other and, nanofiber membranes can efficiently adsorb heavy metals 218], volatile organic compounds [219], and low viscous oils [220] rom wastewater. Hassan et al. [221] used never-dried BC and ross-linked CNF to remove oil from oil-in-water emulsions with roplet sizes <1 m. Tijing et al. [222] produced super-hydrophobic olyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene nanofiber memranes that contain CNTs (1–5 wt%) for high-performance direct ontact membrane distillation (Fig. 30). They found that the flux of he membrane that contains 5 wt% CNTs (24–29.5 L/m2 h) is reproucibly higher than that of commercial super-hydrophobic PVDF embranes (18–18.5 L/m2 h).\nHybrid nanofiber membranes with both photocatalysis and ltration functions can improve water treatment [223]. The memrane photocatalytic activity can solve problems related to the ormation of toxic condensates and membrane fouling, and to the\nresence of very small and harmful organic pollutants in the pereate effluent. Ceramic nanofiber or hybrid polymer/metal oxide anofiber membranes modified with thin photocatalytic layers are ypically used for these purposes [224–226]. Singh et al. [227]\nchematic representation and (F and G) cross-sectional SEM images of the multilayer\nfabricated mesoporous hollow TiO2 nanofibers by coaxial electrospinning for the photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds. These nanofibers were modified by deposition of cadmium sulfide NPs (co-catalyst) on their surface to enhance the light absorption in the visible region. The resulting nanofibers have excellent photocatalytic activity in an aqueous medium, are reusable, and their nanostructures do not change after repetitive usage [227].\nCapacitive deionization (CDI) is an electrochemical approach to deionize water by applying an electrical potential difference over two electrodes, mainly made of porous carbon, immersed in water [141,228–230]. Anionic species are removed from the water and then stored (adsorbed/absorbed) into the anode, whereas cations are stored in the cathode. CDI units are now mainly used for water desalination and deionization, electrodialysis, and reverse osmosis. Mesoporous and hollow carbon nanofibers are excellent candidates for making the electrodes used in CDI units [231]. Metal oxide/carbon nanofibers also have been investigated as electrode material. For instance, Yasin and coworkers [232] showed that ZrO2 nanofiber/activated carbon composites are suitable electrode material for increasing CDI (Fig. 31). Specifically, water desalination was much improved by the addition of ZrO2 nanofiber/activated carbon composites (best performance obtained with 10 wt% zirconia nanofibers relative to the activated carbon). Indeed, electrosorption and salt removal increased from 5.4 mg g−1 and 16.4% with the pristine electrode to 16.4 mg g−1 and 53.3% with the composite electrode, respectively [232]. Dong et al. [229] have utilized electrospinning followed by CO2 activation to prepare a hybrid nanomaterial consisting of CNTs embedded in carbon fibers (Fig. 25a–c). The prepared composite nanofibers have led to a desalination capacity of 6.4 mg/g at an initial NaCl concentration of 400 mg L−1 and a working potential of 1.2 V. The great improvement (39%) with respect to the modification of the\nA.

Membranes for air filtration\nAir filters are used in disposable respirators, indoor air purificaion, industrial gas cleaning, and automotive engine intake filters or the removal of dust particles, viruses, bacteria and volatile rganic compounds [233]. In the function of the particle size, he particulate matter (PM) can be classified as PM10 (≤10 m) nd PM2.5 (≤2.5 m). PM2.5 particles are considered more harmul because they can penetrate in the human respiratory system, ausing lung disease, heart disease, and premature death [234]. anofiber-based filters can be used in hospitals to remove fine dust, acteria, and viruses from the air. Different polymer and ceramic anofiber membrane types, such as poly(vinyl alcohol), polyethyene terephthalate, PAN, silica, and alumina, have been developed or airborne particle filtration [234]. The major advantages of anofiber membranes in air cleaning are their high filtration effiiency and low air resistance [216].\nAs the nanofiber diameter and morphology can significantly ffect the membrane filtering efficiency, electrospinning is suitable or air-filter applications because the morphology and diameter\nydrophobic membrane upon the incorporation of 5 wt% CNTs, and (b) structure of n the fiber, and (d) SEM image of the pristine CNTs used in this study [222].\n(from 40 to 2000 nm) of the electrospun fibers can be tuned by using specific electrospinning parameters [235]. The fine fiber diameters and high packing densities of nanofibrous membranes lead to compact structures with high airflow resistance. This shortens the filter service life and increases energy consumption [236]. To overcome this problem, Gao et al. [234] fabricated a low-resistance 3D nanofibrous composite membrane by free surface electrospinning for effective capture of PM2.5 particles. This composite nanofiber membrane has a ternary PAN structure composed of scaffold nanofibers, thin nanofibers, and microspheres. The microspheres enlarge the inter-fiber voids, thus significantly reducing the pressure drop [234]. Zhang et al. fabricated an efficient poly(mphenylene isophthalamide) nanofiber/nets (PMIA NF/N) air filter via electrospinning/netting. The prepared filter exhibits the superior properties including ultralight weight (0.365 g m−2), ultrathin thickness (∼0.5 m), and high tensile strength (72.8 MPa) for effective air filtration of about 99.9% and low-pressure drop of 92 Pa for 300–500 nm particles (Fig. 32).\nCarbon nanofibers combined with other non-woven products have been used to produce aerosol filters and face masks. Electrospun nylon nanofibers are incorporated in gas filters for turbines, compressors and generators [237,238]. PI nanofibers are suitable high-temperature air filter material due to their excellent thermal stability, chemical resistance, and strong mechanical properties\n24 A.

Gu et al. [240] recently described a rotating triboelectric anogenerator (R-TENG)-enhanced PI nanofiber filter that effiiently removes airborne PM (>0.5 m) (Fig. 33). They showed that he filter removal efficiency is increased, particularly for particles maller than 100 nm, from 27.1% without R-TENG to 83.6% with the -TENG, with the highest removal efficiency (90.6%) for nanofiber ith a diameter of 33.4 nm [240].\n. Nanofibers for biomedical applications\nNanofibers are particularly attractive for applications in drug elivery, burn and wound care, tissue engineering, blood purificaion, and treatment of various diseases. The nanofiber high surface rea increases the adhesion of cells, proteins, and drugs while proiding lightweight devices with significant cost savings [241]. Here, e will describe some of the most popular biomedical applications f nanofibers and the key parameters that influence their perforance.\n.1. Drug delivery\nNanofiber potential for drug delivery has been investigated sing small organic drugs and macromolecules, such as proeins and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Nevertheless, before linical validation and marketing approval, in vivo pre-clinical tudies must be carried out to evaluate the safety and toxicity f these systems [242]. Bioactive molecules can be incorporated n the bulk phase of electrospun nanofibers or on their suraces by nanofiber post-treatment, immobilization of drug-loaded anocarriers on nanofibers, co-electrospinning of drug-polymer ompounds, and coaxial/emulsion electrospinning (Fig. 34) [243].\nF), (d) electrospinning setup used to produce the composite nanofibers and (d) the\nCo-electrospinning is the most used drug incorporation strategy due to its simplicity (no need for post-fabrication processing), and relatively low-cost. The first studies focused mainly on encapsulating various antibacterial and anti-tumor agents in electrospun nanofibers to develop a slow-release drug delivery system [243].\n5.2. Scaffolds for tissue engineering\nTissue engineering approaches typically require scaffolds, cells and biochemical cues (e.g., growth factors) and mechanical stimuli to create functional tissues. Compared to traditional implant/biomaterial surfaces, nanofiber scaffolds with a nanofibril framework are an exceptional system that can mimic the natural human tissue design at the nanometer scale [244]. The nanofiber small diameter closely matches that of natural extracellular matrix fibers, and its relatively large surface area favors cell attachment and bioactive factor loading [245]. Similar to extracellular matrices, nanofibers could be loaded with various bioactive agents to control their local concentration and diffusion. In restorative surgery, nanofibers are used as scaffolds for skin, and musculoskeletal (bone, cartilage, ligaments, and skeletal muscle) and neural tissues [246]. They are commonly used for the fabrication of artificial blood vessels and organs, biocompatible and biodegradable medical implants, medical diagnostic tools, fabrics for protection against environmental and infectious agents in hospitals, and cosmetic and dental material.\nIn scaffold fabrication, the pore structure must be finely controlled because it directly affects cell infiltration and nutrient supply. Nanofiber scaffolds with high fiber alignment display the desired mechanical properties and promote cell migration, orientation, and differentiation, compared with randomly-distributed\nA.

[249] developed novel 3D honeycomb architecture scaffold based on electropun hybrid nanofibers that include hydrolytically degradable oly(l-lactide- -caprolactone) and extracellular matrix protein brinogen (PLCL/FBG) and strongly supports osteogenic differentition of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) Fig. 35). This has important clinical implications because it can ave the way to the development of bioinspired scaffolds for bone egeneration by mimicking the osteogenic conditions in the stem ell niche [249].\nShape memory polymers (SMPs) have been investigated for arious academic and industrial biomedical applications in drug elease, scaffold design, and cell growth templates. Ongoing esearch suggests that “nanofibers offer new microscopic strucures with the potential of enhanced SMP performance” [250–252].\nNanofibrous scaffolds are used as drug delivery vehicles to nduce a specific cell or tissue response [3]. They can be loaded\nith drugs using several methods [253,253,254]; however, with ost of these techniques, the drug ‘burst release’ will lead to an nitial high delivery rate, followed by a lower release rate. This ay reduce the time during which the drug is released at effective oses. Coating the nanofiber surface with a polymer and altering he polymer composition may reduce the initial burst and extend he release time course [255]. Although some small compounds ould be easily mixed with polymers in organic or aqueous solvents, ighly charged (nucleic acids) and large (proteins) molecules do\not homogeneously dissolve in the organic solvents that are typ-\ncally used in electrospinning, and others cannot be electrospun. n the other hand, by using coaxial electrospinning, the drug is estricted to the central core of the fibers, creating a reservoir for\nss-section of the membrane with a basis weight of 0.365 g m after filtration (air\ndrug release. Surface modification techniques (e.g., plasma or wet chemical treatment) can be used to treat the nanofibers before the drug adsorption/immobilization on such surfaces. This will create surface conditions suitable for drug binding/adsorption, although it does not limit the burst release.\nEngineering living tissues for reconstructive surgery requires an appropriate cell source, optimal culture conditions, and a biodegradable scaffold. A variety of natural (e.g., gelatin [256], collagen [257] and elastin [258]) and synthetic (poly( -caprolactone) (PCL) [259], poly(l-lactic acid) [248], PU [260], poly(ethylene glycol) and PCL copolymers, poly(l-lactic acid-co- -caprolactone) (PLCL) [261] and poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) [262]) bridgeable polymers have been electrospun into nanofibers for tissue engineering applications. The choice of the most suitable drug/polymers combination for surface modification and the control of the nanofiber diameter and alignment can provide a blueprint for engineering specific tissues [263].\n5.3. Wound dressing and substitute biomaterials\nSkin is the largest organ of the human body, is at the interface with the external environment, and protects the body against pathogens and water loss [264]. Wound dressings are used to protect the wound from the external environment, maintain a moist environment, and facilitate healing. Therefore, their performance is influenced by their fluid uptake capacity (moisture retention) and water evaporation rate. Micro and nanofibrous materials have been used for wound dressings [265]. Indeed, the nanofiber morphology and dimensions are similar to those of the local (insoluble) extracellular matrix structure. Nanofibrous wound dressings promote\n26 A.

Moreover, they can be loaded ith antimicrobials drugs, growth factors, vitamins, and comounds that promote skin regeneration and prevent contamination 265,266]. Nanofibers can function in moist environments and do ot need to be frequently changed, thus reducing pain and scaring, hich is very important for the management of burn victims.\nNatural polymers, such as collagen [267], elastin [258] and chiosan [268], are particularly good candidates for wound dressing. hey are inherently biocompatible with the invading cells and can e remodeled and degraded through natural mechanisms. They ay also display inherent hemostatic and anti-microbial activities hat ultimately accelerate wound-healing [269]. Electrospinning ersatility allows the production of nanofibers from type I and III ollagens, which represent 80–85% and 8–11% of the dermal matrix, espectively [270]. Chitosan contains amino and hydroxyl groups hat offer unique cationic, chelating, and film-forming properties. hitosan-PCL nanofibers associate chitosan biological features with CL mechanical features. Chitosan-PCL nanofiber scaffolds repreent a biomimetic approach to skin repair by functioning as a rovisional matrix that favor wound closure [271]. Recent studes on the use of BC tubes as blood vessel replacement showed that C biomaterials promote coagulation [272], endothelial cell attachent, proliferation, viability and invasion [273,274]. Fig. 36 shows ome examples of CNF-based substitute biomaterials.\n.4. Membranes for blood filtration\nHemodialysis is a treatment for patients with kidney failure hat can be performed at home or in the hospital. However, he machines used to filter blood (i.e., to replace the kidney unction) are often very large, expensive, and require intensive\naintenance. Recently, researchers have developed a wearable anofiber mesh that could be a cheaper alternative to hemodialysis\nalloidin (green) to mark the actin cytoskeleton at day 1 (A–C), day 2 (D–F) and day r is referred to the web version of the article.)\n[276]. The blood-contacting membrane is made of an electrospun polyethylene-co-vinyl alcohol polymer and zeolites, which are aluminosilicates with microporous structures that can absorb waste products/toxins from the blood. The ratio of silicon to aluminum within zeolites could be used to control the number of adsorbed toxins [276].\nDue to their high porosity, interconnectivity, micro-scale interstitial space, and large surface-to-volume, non-woven electrospun nanofiber meshes are an ideal material for blood filtration, protein purification and toxin removal from biological fluids, and also for removal of inorganic waste and heavy metals in water treatment devices [277]. In such meshes, affinity layers can be fabricated to selectively capture specific molecules by immobilizing the relevant ligand onto the surfaces [160,236]. Fig. 37 shows high-performance composite hemodialysis membranes that include a two-tier composite structure with an ultrathin hydrophilic separation layer of chemically cross-linked polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and an electrospun PAN nanofibrous supporting layer. The optimized PVA/PAN membrane shows high permeability (∼290.5 L/m2 h at 0.1 MPa) and excellent selectivity. In hemodialysis simulation experiments, 82.6% of urea and 45.8% of lysozyme were cleaned and 98.8% of bovine serum albumin was retained by optimized PVA/PAN membranes [160].\n6. Other applications\nWe are still in the early days of the commercial exploitation of nanofibers, but some interesting applications in textiles, papermaking, composite toughening, sound absorbing materials and shape memory materials are currently explored.\n6.1. Defense and safety\nMilitaries, firefighters, as well as law implementation and medical staff may require high-level protection against [160] biological\n28 A. Barhoum et al. / Applied Materials Today 17 (2019) 1–35\nCopyright Elsevier, 2014.\nCopyright 2006, Elsevier.\nMater\n( a b i s c c p t a s i M a\n6\np d d s c t t a C a t i p c t m i c i a\n6\ni t a a i t w b c\n6\nfi h t w p i A a n e fi\nA. Barhoum et al. / Applied\ne.g., bacterial spores, viruses) and chemical threats (e.g., nerve gents, mustard gas, and cyanides) [278]. Such protection should e effective in various environments (urban, agricultural, and ndustrial settings). Governments are putting extra resources to trengthen soldiers’ safety on the battlefield [279–281]. Nanofibers an improve: (i) the detection (sensitivity and specificity) of chemial and biological warfare agents at very small concentrations (parts er billion); and (ii) the protection against threats through filtraion and destruction by decomposition of dangerous toxins (e.g., erosols, toxic volatile compounds, viruses, bacteria). Different trategies to design nanofiber surfaces to capture and decontamnate warfare agents are currently under investigation [282,283].\netal NPs (Ag, MgO, Ni, Ti, etc.) that can decompose warfare agents lso can be embedded in nanofibers [284].\n.2. Functional materials for smart textile\nNanofiber-based textiles and fabrics can have multifunctional roperties and applications as warming and cooling materials, conuctive textiles, communicating textiles, sensors and actuators, igital fashion, chromatic textiles [285,286]. The high porosity and mall pores of nanofiber mats offer good resistance to harmful hemical aerosols. Nanofiber technology can be used to improve he fabric performance (e.g., anti-bacterial properties, detoxificaion capability, waterproofing, and breathability). For clothing, it lso is important to be able to add different colors to the fabric. olored solution electrospinning has been used to fabricate colorful nd visually appealing nanofiber fabrics with various functionaliies. In this method, powdered dyes can be dissolved or dispersed n the electrospinning solution or in the pre-formed polymer to roduce stained nanofibers by electrospinning [287]. The as-spun olored fabrics and membranes have excellent level-dyeing properies and color stability. For instance, polyvinyl butyral/cationic dye\nembranes show good color uniformity and high hydrophobicty with potential applications in color printing and anticorrosive oating/painting [288]. However, this technique is laborious and nefficient, particularly in the case of nanofibers with high surface rea and high light scattering ability [289,290].\n.3. Additives for papermaking\nAddition of silicate, carbo, and CNFs in papermaking may mprove the process and product sustainability [291]. For example, hey allow obtaining a stronger paper with unique functionalities nd lower base paper weight [73]. CNFs and clay nanosheets, such s montmorillonite, are often used in papermaking and polymer ndustry to increase the mechanical properties and barrier resisance of papers and polymers (Fig. 38). Replacing pigment fillers ith silicate-based nanofibers can increase the opacity of some ase sheets [292]. Conductive carbon nanofiber paper can be fabriated using carbon nanofibers, solvents, and dispersants [293].\n.4. Sound absorbing and shape memory materials\nSound absorption materials (e.g., paper, cotton, cork, foams, bers, membranes and perforated panels) can efficiently reduce igh-frequency sounds, but display poor absorption properties for he low- and medium-frequency components (250–2000 Hz) to hich the human ear is sensitive. Nanofiber-based materials are romising alternatives for noise reduction, and some studies have nvestigated the acoustic applications of nanofibril membranes. ircraft manufacturers are assessing new methods and materils to decrease the amount of noise in the fuselage. Electrospun anocomposite fibers may be the ideal solution, and may offer sevral advantages compared with conventional materials, such as berglass, mineral fiber wool and wood fibers [295,296], partic-\nials Today 17 (2019) 1–35 29\nularly (i) larger surface area (100–10,000 times bigger than that of conventional fibers); (ii) theoretically higher noise absorption rate because of the interaction of air molecules of sound waves with the nanofiber surfaces; (iii) lower overall weight; (iii) higher porosity; and (iv) possibility to electrospin nanofibers on composite, metal surfaces, polymeric materials, including flame-resistant polymers.\n7. Opportunities and future challenges\nNanofiber technology advances allow now the fabrication of nanofibers starting from a very broad range of materials, such as synthetic and natural polymers, and also metals, ceramics, and organic/inorganic, inorganic/inorganic composite system [297–306]. Combining different materials into a device might offer unique properties (e.g., the polymer flexibility with the conductivity of metallic dopants). It also represents a fabrication challenge because the most suitable manufacturing conditions and solution phases need to be identified. The incorporation or utilization of functional nanofibers will open new opportunities for nanofiberbased materials.\nCurrently, many efforts are focused on up-scaling the production and improving the nanofiber properties. Among the different fabrication techniques, electrospinning has the unique ability to produce nanofibers using different materials in various fibrous assemblies. Due to the relative simple set-up and high production rate, electrospinning is highly attractive for both academic and industrial applications. Several electrospinning methods have been developed to overcome the main limitations of the standard electrospinning method: low productivity (e.g., needleless electrospinning) and the requirement of organic solvents (e.g., hot melt electrospinning). These new methods also add new functions, such as controlling nanofiber morphology, compositing, electrospinning of low conductivity polymers and high molecular weight polymers [131].\nNevertheless, the production of nanofiber materials must overcome many challenges:\n(i) Despite the development of new nanofiber fabrication techniques, the commercial production of high-quality nanofibers is still limited. Particularly, industrial fabrication techniques should be able to reproduce the specific positions and orientation of nanofibers at a larger scale. From an environmental perspective, it is also important to consider the biocompatibility and number of used materials and the amount of energy required for the manufacturing process.\n(ii) Spinning of new materials might be required to facilitate continuous operations at larger scales. Moreover, ‘green’ materials (e.g., degradable and recyclable materials derived from biological sources) might be needed to minimize the impact of electrospun nanofibers on the environment and human health. More attention should be given to eco-friendly polymers. More research on needleless and solvent-free electrospinning is needed to produce ultrafine fibers of sub-micrometer size and high efficiency. Solvent-free electrospinning is a promising candidate for a wide range of advanced applications.\n(iii) Future research should focus on improving the properties (e.g., composition, diameter, morphology, pore size) of nanofibers\nused for healthcare and biomedical applications. Most of the current applications of nanofibers are at the early proof-ofconcept stage, and most studies are still performed only in vitro.\n30 A.

Conclusions and remarks\nAlthough, currently, nanofibers are mainly used for envionmental protection, many other applications such as energy roduction and storage, drug delivery, healthcare, constructions, nd building materials, are rapidly emerging. By selecting the uitable fabrication techniques, the nanofiber bulk and surface roperties can be readily engineered to obtain the desired optical, iological, chemical, mechanical, magnetic or electrical properties. anofibers incorporating NPs have an interesting and promising uture. In this review, we described many devices and applications hat use functional and flexible nanofiber electrodes and memranes. Due to their small diameter, high surface area, controlled echanical properties, and porous network structure, nanofibers an be used as: (i) electrode and membrane materials in fuel cells, atteries, and supercapacitors; (ii) ultrafiltration membranes for ir purification, and wastewater treatment; (iii) bioactive materials nd scaffolds for tissue engineering, drug delivery, wound dressing. anofiber devices and components should bring major changes, articularly in the medical and healthcare sectors thanks to their uperior performances, due to the bigger surface areas that maxmize interactions with biological systems, and the possibility to ncorporate different features in a singular device. However, before heir widespread medical application, major issues linked to the anofiber biocompatibility and chemical integrity must be solved. or instance, the disintegration and/or leaching of nanoparticulates\nstructure; (b and c) comparison of the mechanical properties (b) and of the oxygen aper containing 50% montmorillonite and of other clay nanocomposites [294].\nin bodily fluids cannot be tolerated because their retrieval is nearly impossible.\nDespite the many studies on the nanofiber properties and applications in the last decade, the technologies for reproducible, large-scale production of nanofibers have emerged very slowly, and this limits their widespread applications. Nevertheless, research on nanofiber functionality will eventually lead to the development of low-cost, energy-efficient and biocompatible functional products, some of which might possess unique functionalities that are not available yet.\nConflict of interest\nAll authors have declared that there are no conflicts of interests regarding the contributions in this publication.\nAcknowledgments\nVery special thanks are recorded to the Egypt-France Joint Program (STDF-IFE 2019, Project No. 31216) for giving Dr. Ahmed Barhoum the opportunity and financial support to pursue a postdoctoral in France.\nReferences\n[1] D.
