      "text" : "Nowadays, hybrid materials from organic/inorganic materials gains intensive concern of researchers due to their unique properties [1–8]. Because of their capacity to behave as stabilizers or surface capping agents, organic polymers are great hosts for trapping metal and semiconductor nanoparticles. Due to the fascinating characteristics of nanosize and large surface area; nanoparticles are more attractive so, the polymer/nanofiller composites presented properties better than conventional polymer composites [9–14].\nPolyester is the fourth most produced polymer, accounting for about 18% of world polymer manufacturing [15]. Recently, ferromagnetic particles integrated in polymer composites increasingly used as microwave absorbents at high frequencies [16–18]. NiZn ferrite has high saturation\nmagnetization, notable chemical stability, and excellent mechanical strength as one of the most significant magnetic materials [19]. NiZn ferrite nanomaterials showed good results for the attenuation of electromagnetic waves [20]. The ferromagnetic NiZn ferrite nanomaterials are generally useful in electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption owing to its natural resonance for EMI shielding materials. Nevertheless, their application is restricted by high density and hardness. Therefore, it continues a need for a comparatively lightweight, flexible, and effective NiZn ferrite composites for microwave absorption across broad spectrum of bands. Accordingly, magnetic composite materials generally prepared with ferro- and ferrimagnetic particles integrated in a polymer matrix are commonly used in electronic appliances and systems such as microwave transmitters, microwave inductors, and radio-absorbing materials [21–27]. Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles showed promising dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and saturation magnetization as reported in our previous work [28]. Consequently, we selected this ferrite composition for preparing polyester nanocomposites in the present work.\nIn this work, polyester/Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanocomposites containing high concentrations up to 50 wt% were prepared by conventional solution casting method.

The addition of nanoparticles into the polyester matrix has a little effect on the peak temperature. The mass losses of polyester/Ni0.5Z0.5Fe2O4 nanocomposites decrease as the concentration of nanoparticles increases, these behaviour is in the lines of earlier literature [7, 38 ]. According to the data tabulated in Table 1, the integration of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix enhanced the thermal properties of polymer nanocomposite compared to the pure polyester. The increased thermal stability of the nanocomposites can be ascribed to high crosslinking density and secondary interactions imparted by Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 with the polymer chains [6, 7]. According to their contribution, the integration of nanoparticles in polymer matrix limited the movement of the polymer chains, lowered the free radical exchange and, hence, restricted the thermal degradation. The mass losses at various temperatures 200, 350 and 450 °C of polyester/Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanocomposites are summarized in Table 1. These losses sured that the nanocomposites have thermal stability higher than pure polyester as the mass losses decrease with increasing the nanoparticles content.

      "text" : "The real part of complex permittivity (ε′) for all polyester/ Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanocomposites decrease with frequency and becomes saturated at high frequencies, this trendline agree with the findings of other studies [34, 39, 40]. High ε′ at low frequencies might be on the grounds that the dipoles\nhave adequate time to get adjust to the electric field. Reduction of ε′ at higher frequencies may be due to the inability of the dipoles to align fastly with rapidly changing electric field. At very low frequencies up to 14 Hz, there is an overlap between the curves of different concentration of Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles but after this value the ε′ increase with Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles which might be interpreted due to the decrease of charge carriers in polyester leading to the increase in the real permittivity. Also, can be basically attributed to a gradual formation of microcapacitor networks in the polyester matrix as the nanofiller increase. Moreover, this increase might be due to the accumulation of charge carriers in the internal surface of polyester matrix which can be demonstrated by Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars effects [40, 41]. Evidentially, at frequencies higher than 5.0 Hz the ε′ values decreased for the sample containing 50.0 wt% of Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 which may be due to agglomeration of nanoparticles (Fig. 5).\nThe variation of dielectric loss (log (ε″)) with angular frequency log (ω) at room temperature for polyester nanocomposites at various Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles contents is depicted in Fig. 6. As given in the figure all specimens have the same behavior, as ε″ decreases as the frequency increases and becomes saturated at high frequencies. As the content of Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles increased the dielectric loss increased. The frequency-dependence relationship of ε″ is given by the equation [42]\nIn another form\nwhere m = − 4k T Wm , where s , ∞ , N, n, e, k , T , o,Wm are static permittivity, frequency limiting permittivity (infinity permittivity), concentration of localized sites, number of electrons, electron charge, Bolzman’s constant, absolute temperature, relaxation time, the energy required to move an electron from one site to the infinite and angular frequency, respectively, and B is a constant. By applying this model in the frequency range (1.0 Hz–2 kHz) to our results we can deduce the values of Wm listed in Table 2. It can be seen from the data in Table 2 that Wm values generally decreased with Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 content and are higher than that of PVC/NiO (0.025–0.027 eV) [40], but lower than that of PVC/La0.95Bi0.05FeO3 nanocomposites (0.66–1.11 eV) [43].\nThe Cole–Cole curves for polyester nanocomposites loaded with various contents of Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles at room temperature are displayed in Fig. 7. Each Cole–Cole graph involved semicircle referring to multirelaxation processes. Therefore, fitting of these curves gives\n(1) ��( ) = ( s − ∞ ) 2 2N\n(\nne2\ns\n)3\nk T 0 mWM −4 m.\n��( ) = B m,\n1 3\n1 3\nthe values of both static permittivity (εs), high frequency permittivity (ε∞) and dielectric intensity (Δε) that summarized in Table 2. From this data, we can see that these results higher than those observed for PVC/CuO [44], PVC/ NiO [40] and PVC/La0.95Bi0.05FeO3 nanocomposites [43]. Additionally, the polyester nanocomposites containing 10.0\nand 40.0 wt% of Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 have the highest εs and ε∞ values.\nThe relaxation time (τ0) can be calculated from the Cole–Cole analysis according to the relation [45]:\nwhere v is the distance on the Cole–Cole plot between εs and an experimental point, u is the distance between the experimental point and ε∞ and α is a shape parameter that describe the symmetric broadening of relaxation. The relationship between ln ( v\nu\n)\nand ln( ) was fit with a linear line as indicated in Fig. 8 and by knowing the slope (1 − α) and intercept of the fitting line ((1 − α) ln τ0), τ0 can be obtained and using this equation τ0 = 1/2πf0 we can estimate f0. The values of τ0 and f0 are tabulated in Table 2, which are higher than the observed values for PVC/CuO [44] PVC/NiO [40] and PVC/La0.95Bi0.05FeO3 nanocomposites [43].\nThe variation of ac conductivity (σAC) of polyester nanocomposites loaded with various contents of Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles as a function of frequency ranging from 0.01 Hz to 20 MHz at room temperature shown in Fig. 9. As clear from Fig. 9, the σAC is frequency independent for the range 0.01Hz ≤ f ≤ 5MHz , strictly related to DC conductivity and after this range, increase rapidly for all specimens, which may be due to the increase in the mobility of charge carrier [46]. The enhancement of σAC with the addition of nanoparticles is explained on basis of the relative tendency of hopping of charge carriers in polyester/Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanocomposites is higher than that in pure polyester. This high increment in conductivity may be due to the increase in the formation of continuous conductive pathways inside the polyester network [47].\nFigure 10 presents the frequency dependence of real part of electrical impedance (Z′) of polyester loaded with various contents of Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles at room temperature. The values of Z′ decreases as the loading of nanoparticles increases as well as with frequency and this behavior is the same for all nanocomposites.

The synthesized samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and dielectric measurements. The XRD patterns confirmed the existence of both polyester and Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles peaks. FTIR analysis confirmed the incorporation of Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles into the polyester matrix in agreement with XRD results. SEM micrographs showed distribution of nanoparticles inside the polymer and TEM image showed a little agglomeration of Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 with flake-like micrometer-sized particles. The incorporation of nanofiller into the polymer increases the thermal stability as the weight losses reduced with nanoparticles content. Dielectric analysis depicted the enhancement in both real and imaginary parts of permittivity when nanoparticles concentration increased. Additionally, the AC conductivity increased while the electric impedance decreased with increasing Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 concentration.",
