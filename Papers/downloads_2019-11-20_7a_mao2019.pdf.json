Development of efficient and clean nergy technology has become the top priority of current scientific\nless environmental pollution [1–9]. For example, nanostructured Au has received consideration attention in electrocatalysis, organic catalysis, sensor and biomedicine field [10–14]. Three-way catalyst, Pt-Pd-Rh with good catalytic performance and anti-toxicity, has been proved the first choice for automotive exhaust gas purifica-\nesearch. In this context, catalysts, especially noble metal catalysts, lay a key role in energy conversion and storage for improving onversion efficiency and selectivity and at the same time cause\n∗ Corresponding author.

Up to now, many research groups have exploited different ways to prepare noble metal nanomaterials (NMNs) with various architectures and compositions, and their catalytic properties have also been investigated [16–46]. It is note-worthy that the alloying of one or two kinds of transition metals with the noble metal has become a valid strategy to develop excellent electrocatalysts. In this regard, many efforts have been made to synthesize\noday 26 (2019) 164–175 165\nm n e m b p\ns t c v w T t a r s t ( o p m r\nv e a m s F t s o t s p t p t s t s t t m n A f r r s N i u h c a l\nC\nS\nr\nJ. Mao et al. / Nano T\nultimetallic nanomaterials (MNs). Compared to monometallic anocrystals, MNs offer more catalytic reaction sites to enable fficient adsorption and activation of substrate molecules or interediates, thereby, promoting the reaction. Moreover, interactions etween different metals regulate the geometric and electronic roperties of catalysts showing synergistic effects.\nHowever, understanding the relationship between the fine tructure (surface/interface, defect sites, lattice strain, coordinaion number, etc) and properties of catalysts remains an open hallenge. From the structure viewpoint, MNs prepared by conentional chemical methods have poor control and reproducibility, hich makes it difficult to determine the structure of active sites. hus, unclear nanostructures make it impossible to investigate heir surface/interface/defect sites/lattice strain-dependent catlytic properties. From the viewpoint of catalytic properties, there emains much room for improvements in catalytic activity and tability of MNs. Usually, nano-sized catalysts without decoraions show inferior catalytic activities for oxygen evolution reaction OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), resulting in lower verall energy conversion efficiency. As a consequence, design and recise regulation of NMNs structure with high catalytic perforance are very important and it requires more efforts on the ational design of microstructures. The synthesis of well-defined NMNs at atomic level proides an opportunity to solve the afore-mentioned problems. The mergence of some advanced characterization methods, such as berration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), X-ray absorption fine tructure (XAFS), etc. greatly boosts the developments in this field. or example, XAFS technique can be used to obtain local strucure information such as coordination number, bond angle, valence tate, and bond length of the catalyst, which helps in the design f nanocatalysts with specific geometries and electronic strucures [47,48]. The geometric effects could influence the electronic tructure of nanocrystals, changing the catalytic properties. Thus, recisely tuning the geometric structure of nanocrystals is an effecive way to boost the catalytic results. In addition, studies have roved that the synthesis of nanomaterials with controlled strucures is crucial for achieving desired catalytic properties (activity, electivity, and stability) [49–52]. Regulation of the microstrucure of the catalyst or even changes in several atoms can have ignificant effects on the catalysis. For example, Yang’s group found hat ordered AuCu nanocrystals (NCs) could effectively reduce CO2 o CO [53], while the AuCu alloy with disordered nanostructures\nainly produced H2 during the reduction of CO2. A similar pheomenon can widely be observed in cases of other nanocatalysts. lthough precise synthesis of nanocrystals has been highly success-\nul in recent years, a summary of nanocrystal structure and catalytic eaction at the atomic level has rarely been followed [54]. In this eview, we aim to summarize the recent progress on controllable ynthesis of NMNs (Fig. 1), which includes surface engineering of MNs, atomic layer coating of NMNs, metal doping or substitution, ntermetallic compounds. More importantly, the above finely reglated structures displayed excellent catalytic properties for ORR, ydrogen evolution reaction (HER), semi-hydrogenation of alkynes, hemoselective hydrogenation, and others. Finally, the challenges nd opportunities of controllable synthesis of NMNs at an atomic evel are presented.\nontrollable synthesis of NMNs at an atomic level\nurface engineering\nThe catalytic properties of metal nanomaterials are strongly elated to their surface structures [55–62]. Surface engineer-\ning (mainly for post-modification) is an effective strategy for designing catalysts with tailored structures, which constitutes a desirable environment for the catalytic reaction. Generally, the surface engineering strategy allows preparation of nanocrystals with unique morphologies including nanoframe, concave, composition segregated nanostructures, etc. In recent years, a variety of synthetic strategies have been developed to construct specific surface/subsurface with the purpose of elevating the catalytic performance, e.g., chemical etching to cause atomic rearrangement, electrochemical de-alloying to form segregated surfaces, atmosphere annealing to design phase interface, gas-assisted reduction to manufacture defects, et al. Among them, the chemical etching strategy can be managed to selectively remove active metal atoms from alloy nanocrystals to fabricate novel concave/hollow structures by precisely controlling the etching strength and the reaction environment. The remaining atoms of NCs will spontaneously rearrange, leading to the post-decoration on size, shape and composition of NCs. For example, Li et al. developed a controllable coordination-assisted strategy to obtain concave Pt-Ni alloys by using dimethylglyoxime as the corrosion ligand (Fig. 2a–d) [63]. They chose octahedral PtNi10 as a model to study the etching evolution mechanism. The concavity increased with the prolonged chemical etching time owing to the larger dissolution rate of Ni soluble species than that of Pt. The initiation of etching process would be accustomed to occuring along {100} direction for transforming the octahedron into spherical particles. It indicated that the etching process was firstly performed at the corner. The etching process gradually transferred from original {100} direction to the {110} and {111} directions when the new narrow {100} facets emerged. During the further etching process, the edges and facets were excavated into the cavities while the metal atoms of pristine octahedral were rearranged to form concave structure. They applied DFT to calculate the cohesive energy regarding the chemical potential of the metal atoms, suggesting that the different etching priorities at specific sites of octahedron were governed by the cohesive energy. Benefiting from the large surface area and high density of exposed atomic steps or defects, the concave PtNi3 nanostructure exhibited superior catalytic activity and stability compared to the uncorroded PtNi3 and Pt3Ni catalysts.\nAdditionally, the etchants with different preferential etching capacities can lead to the production of various unexpected struc-\n166 J.

The nanocage or nanoframe structures ith high specific surface area, large void space and good threeimensional accessibility have attracted a wide attention in recent ears. Choosing a suitable etchant is a great challenge for conrolling and moderating the corrosion process. Recently, Yang and oworkers reported the highly opened Pt-rich Pt3Ni nanoframes by electing oleylamine (OAm) as the corrosion ligand (Fig. 2e–i) [64]. tNi3 polyhedra were first synthesized in OAm system under Ar tmosphere. The as-prepared OAm-capped PtNi3 rhombic dodecaedra were redispersed in hexanes and finally converted to Pt3Ni anoframes under ambient conditions for 2 weeks. OAm plays a ritical role in corrosion by readily creating soluble complexes with i2+. The nanoframes with 2 nm thick edges could also be fabricated aster via the preferential dissolution of rich Ni species by holdng at 120 ◦C just for 12 h. Furthermore, the surfactant OAm was emoved by thermal annealing to make surface-clean nanoframes efore electrochemical measurement. The highly opened Pt3Ni anoframes with three-dimensional structure greatly enhanced he accessibility of the reactants to both interior and exterior suraces, which ensured the high catalytic activity and durability for RR compared with benchmark catalysts. Occasionally, etching and alvanic replacement reaction are occurred simultaneously in one ystem because of the different electronegativities of multi-metals. urthermore, Li and coworkers used this feature to prepare Au sland on Pt-Ni trimetallic nanoframe catalysts by the combinaion of priority-related chemical etching and the electronegativity ifference between Ni and Au atoms [65]. Chemical etching plays\nf the samples obtained at different stages, TEM images of (f) initial solid Pt3Ni, (g) on high surface area carbon. Reprinted with permission from Ref. [64]. Copyright\na major role in the formation of frame-work structure. First, the galvanic replacement reaction took place between Au (III) and Ni (0) species owing to the lower electronegativity of Ni. It was estimated that galvanic replacement reaction occupied dominantly in the corner because the Ni with high free energy at low-coordination corner sites was readily oxidized. During the gradual progress of the etching, the Au atoms aggregated into isolated islands at the top of the truncated octahedral PtNi3. The segregated Pt-skin edges with decorated Au island (denoted as 10% Au on Pt3Ni) showed higher catalytic activity for methanol electrooxidation and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde hydrogenation than the PtNi3 polyhedron and Pt3Ni bimetallic nanoframes.\nHowever, the chemical etching often occurs in random sites and difficult to control, thus the expected structures may be destroyed during the corrosion process. Removing the active transition metal component of catalysts during the actual catalytic reaction is an effective tactic to form unique surface and promote the catalytic performance. For instance, Duan and coworkers discovered that Ni atoms were removed from one-dimensional PtNi alloy nanowires (NWs) to reach jagged Pt NWs (J-Pt NWs) by electrochemical dealloying process [66]. The J-Pt NWs displayed an ultrahigh mass activity and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) toward ORR compared with Pt/C and regular Pt NWs (R-Pt NWs). At first, the Pt/NiO core/shell NWs were synthesized by a simple wet chemical method. Then, the as-obtained Pt/NiO NWs supported on conductive carbon black were annealed at 450 ◦C under a reducing atmosphere (Ar/H2: 97/3) to form alloy configurations. Finally, the\noday 26 (2019) 164–175 167\np N s a a\nb s Z h m o a f i u a ( a d b N h t t f o i o r T s m a p H i n P u t a T t f\nn r I T a m t D e\nA\nc c o n c p a\nJ. Mao et al. / Nano T\nure ultrafine J-Pt NWs were achieved via cyclic voltammetry while i acted as a sacrificial agent. The DFT simulation revealed that the horter Pt-Pt bond length was presented at J-Pt NWs than R-Pt NWs nd Pt/C, which resulted in a high compressive strain on the rough nd undercoordinated Pt-rich surface structures.\nAnother surface modification method is atmosphere annealing, y which the internal noble metal atoms will be migrated to the urface or near surface. Guo et al. calcined the pre-prepared PtCo igzag nanowires (z-NWs) at 400 ◦C in N2 atmosphere to acquire igh-index faceted Pt-skin PtCo z-NWs [67]. The atomic arrangeent on the surface of NWs and the spatial element distribution f near-surface region would be simultaneously controlled at N2 tmosphere. They proved that Pt-skin PtCo z-NWs with high-index acets could promote activation of reactant molecules, resulting n higher electrocatalytic activity relative to low-index facets. The nique structure of Pt-skin PtCo z-NWs showed excellent catalytic ctivity toward the electrochemical detection of various molecules H2O2, NH2NH2, dopamine, and acetaminophen) and ORR in the cid. Annealing at different atmospheres leads to the formation of ifferent structures. Huang’s group designed multiphase interfaces y controlling different annealing atmospheres, and developed Pti NWs/C-air catalysts with ultrahigh activity and stability toward ydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media [68]. They synhesized different composition-segregated Pt-Ni NWs by adjusting he amount of Ni(acac)2, and then loaded on carbon support for urther annealing under air or H2. Annealing in air, the surface f the Pt-Ni NWs produced a rich NiO interface relative to that n H2. A battery of characterizations distinctly stated that obvius changes occurred with the formation of phase interface with espect to pristine NWs, such as crystal structure and valence state. he as-obtained Pt-Ni NWs/C-air catalysts not only provided a uitable driving force for the dissolution of H2O to produce interediate Hads but also possessed a more remarkable electrostatic ffinity with OH− on the interface of NiOx sites than Pt owing to the artial-occupied d-orbitals of Nix+, resulting in the unprecedented ER performance. Recently, Huang et al. also annealed PtNi NPs n air to form enriched NiO/PtNi interface on the surface of PtNi-O anoparticles (Fig. 3) [69]. First, they synthesized the octahedral tNi/C catalyst in DMF solution, and then annealed at 200 ◦C for 2 h nder air conditions to obtain PtNi-O/C. The detailed characterizaions manifested that Ni atoms were segregated and oxidized after nnealing in the air, and then the enriched phase interface formed. he PtNi-O/C exhibited a mass activity of 7.23 mA/ g at an overpoential of 70 mV, which was 7.9 times higher than commercial Pt/C or HER.\nConsidering the gas atmospheres may influence the growth of anocrystals, Wang’s group developed hydrogen assisted solution oute (HASR) to prepare trimetallic ultrathin Pt-Mo-Ni NWs [70]. n this case, H2 acted as a reducing and structure-directing agent. he HAADF-STEM images showed that the obtained NWs have an mple undercoordination atoms around the surface, which enabled uch higher power density for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) han the state-of-the-art catalysts. CO stripping experiments and FT simulations demonstrated that introducing Mo atoms in NWs nsured the catalyst with enhanced durability.\ntomic layer coating\nIt is well known that precious metal catalysts possess excellent atalytic activities, but their high costs greatly hamper their practial applications. Decorating the metal surface with a small amount f foreign metal at the atomic level not only reduces the cost of oble metal catalysts effectively, but also drastically enhances the atalytic performance due to synergistic effects [71]. The catalytic erformance of metal@Pt catalyst, for example, can be tuned by ltering the thickness of the Pt shell. Simultaneously, the stability\nReprinted with permission from Ref. [69].

The atomic layer coating strategy requires precisely tuning the synthetic parameters, such as amount of precursor, injection rate, reaction temperature and so on. For example, Xia and coworkers used an atomic layer by layer deposition strategy to precisely prepare Pd@PtnL nanostructures (where n is the number of atomic layers) [72]. The thickness of Pt shells could be easily controlled by choosing appropriate amount of the Pt precursor (Fig. 4). It is noteworthy that the introduction of a certain amount of Pt precursor into the growth solution through a syringe pump at a slow rate and high reaction temperature allows for successful coating of ultrathin Pt atoms on the surface of Pd nanocubes. For ORR, the catalytic properties of Pd@PtnL are closely related with the thickness of Pt shell. The Pd@Pt2-3L nanocubes exhibited the highest specific activity among all of the Pd@PtnL catalysts due to the ligand and strain effects, while the Pd@Pt4L and Pd@Pt6L with thicker Pt overlayers showed enhanced stability. The similar strategy can be extended to prepare Pd@PtnL (n = 2–5) octahedra, by using octahedral Pd as seeds and Pt as shells [73]. Compared to tuning the thickness of the shell, more research efforts are focused on adjusting the shape and composition of the core [74]. For example, Xia et al. deposited a few layers of Pt on Pd nanocubes and Pd octahedron [75], followed by selectively etching away the Pd templates. Thus, the Pt cubic nanocages and nano-octahedral with walls as thin as three atomic layers were obtained, both of which showed high electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of oxygen. Besides, coating Ir shell on Pd cubes and octahedra to form Pd@Ir cubes and octahedra can also be achieved by using the seed-mediated method [76].\n168 J.

Recently, nother interesting method to prepare core-shell nanostructures as reported by Wang’s group [77]. Pt3Ga intermetallic nanocrysals were prepared by one-pot strategy in 1-octadecene/oleylamine ixed solvent. Generally, surfactant can act as a physical barrier imits the reactants to the active sites, severely hampering the activty of the catalyst [60]. In this regard, the surfactant is often removed efore catalytic measurement. Amine-protected nanocrystals are sually treated by acetic acid washing under mild reaction condiion. After removing the surfactant by using acetic acid-washing, hey surprisingly found that Pt3Ga could be converted to Pt/Pt3Ga atalyst, which contained two to three atomic-layers of Pt on interetallic Pt3Ga. It is noted that acetic acid can not only remove he surfactant to make the surface clean, but also lead Pt3Ga catlyst to Pt/Pt3Ga core-shell nanostructures. The atomic layer of t possessed 3.2% tensile strain along the [001] direction, as conrmed by atomic resolution HAADF-STEM image. Impressively, the t/Pt3Ga structure with 3.2% tensile strain showed better catalytic erformance than those of its unstrained counterpart and other ommercial Pt/C catalysts. This two-step method could make full se of the diverse morphology of metal. It greatly simplified the omplexity involved in the multimetallic reaction system, and proided an effective route to the overall design and synthesis of anocrystals.\ntaken from the (g) Pd@Pt6L, (h) Pd@Pt4L, and (i) Pd@Pt1L nanocubes, EDX line scan arked in (g–i).\nTwo-dimensional materials have received a lot of attention, due to their fascinating physical and chemical properties. Deposition of single- or few-layers of atoms on the surface of a two-dimensional nanocrystal remarkably influences the inherent properties of the entire structure. However, due to the intrinsic isotropic growth behavior of metals, controllable synthesis of this attractive catalyst is still a challenging task. Hong and coworkers prepared a novel bimetallic Pd/Ru nanoribbons with dimensions of 93.8 ± 17.8 nm (length), 10.2 ± 2.3 nm (width), and 2.7 nm (thickness) in N, Ndimethylacetamide and water solution under CO atmosphere (Fig. 5a–c) [78]. HAADF-STEM images showed that the prepared Pd/Ru nanoribbons were composed of atomically dispersed Ru (up to 5.9%) on ultrathin Pd nanoribbons. In this process, ultrathin Pd nanosheets (NSs) with non-flat surfaces were first synthesized by using CO. After introducing RuCl3 into the above solution, Pd/Ru nanoribbons were quickly formed. Results of the quantitative analysis showed that the surface of the Pd was not atomically flat, which indicated that the Ru adatoms located at the steps or edges of the ultrathin Pd nanoribbons. More importantly, the ultrathin Pd/Ru nanoribbons decrease the binding energies of hydrogen and reaction intermediate, thus increasing the catalytic selectivity as compared with the commercial Pd/C and Ru/C catalysts. A similar manipulation was carried out by Zhang’s group to prepare ultrathin Pd NSs decorated with submonolayer Ru, namely Pd@Ru NSs, by a seed-mediated growth method (Fig. 5d–f) [79]. In contrast to other reported structures, the ultrathin Pd NSs were incompletely covered by atomically dispersed Ru atoms. The mechanism indicated that the pre-synthesized Pd NSs not only decreased the energy bar-\nJ.

By taking advantage of the igh-density of unsaturated atoms and crystal defect in the nanosructures, the Pd@Ru NSs showed the excellent catalytic properties oward the reduction of 4-nitrophenol and semi-hydrogenation f 1-octyne. How to further optimize the structure or composiion of two-dimensional NSs to improve catalytic performance has ecome a major concern of scientists. Huang and coworkers develped a one-pot strategy to prepare PtPb/Pt core/shell hexagonal anoplates in non-aqueous medium [80]. In this synthesis, the conentration of Pt and Pb precursors, along with the solvents and urfactants, and reducing agent (ascorbic acid) were all responsible or the formation of well-defined PtPb/Pt nanoplates. Aberrationorrected HAADF-STEM images proved that the obtained PtPb/Pt anoplates had an intermetallic core comprising of PtPb phase and our uniform atomic layers of Pt shells. Owing to its large tensile train, this novel structure showed great improvement in terms of oth high catalytic activity and durability toward ORR, as compared o PtPb nanoparticles and Pt catalysts.\nAlthough few strategies have been designed for the synthesis of everal atomic layers of noble metal on substrate, synthesis of nanotructure that consists of a monolayer of metal atoms on another etal surface, by solution-phase method, has rarely been reported. ecently, for the first time, Hong and coworkers investigated an ffective one-step underpotential deposition process to synthesize dRu nanocrystals [81], in which a monolayer of Ru atoms covered he porous Pd octahedra (Fig. 6). In a typical synthesis, K2PdCl4 nd RuCl3·xH2O were dissolved in formaldehyde aqueous solution nd heated in an autoclave and at 130 ◦C for 2 h. The relatively low emperature and shorter reaction time could facilitate the formaion of this unique structure. Moreover, the introduction of Ru ions n the typical synthesis could lead to the porous Pd nanoparticles,\nhile solid nanoparticles were obtained without the presence of u ions. For semihydrogenation of alkynes, the porous Pd nanopar-\nicles covered with a monolayer of Ru atoms exhibited excellent atalytic activity and stereoselectivity as compared to the Pd catayst, due to the synergistic effects between the monolayer Ru atoms nd porous Pd nanoparticles.\nReprinted with permission from Ref.

This protocol allows preparation of nanocrystals with advantages such as low amount of metal used (especially for precious metals) and good model catalyst for recognition of catalytic active center. Generally, there are several main methods for the synthesis of doped\n170 J.

Zhang et al. synthesized a series of catalysts with Pt sinle atom distributed on the surface of Au nanoparticle via a facile nalogous colloidal method (Fig. 7) [82]. In terms of PtAu nanoparicles with tailored surface, the catalysts could be classified as Au ith single-atom Pt sites (Pt7Au93 and Pt4Au96), Au with Pt cluster ites (Pt17Au83), and core-shell (Pt78Au22 and Pt53Au47). Among the lassifications, Pt4Au96, with an enhanced forward current density f 3.77 A mgPt−1 for formic acid electrooxidation was manifested s compared with the core-shell Pt78Au22 and commercial Pt/C. FT simulations and the atomic resolution HAADF-STEM images roved that the Pt4Au96 with single-atom Pt surface sites tightly urrounded by Au atoms ensured its excellent catalytic activity. urthermore, Zeng’s group achieved Pt single atom on Ni NCs via he galvanic replacement between Ni NCs and Pt precursor (Fig. 8) 83]. The pre-prepared Ni NCs were dispersed in hexane, mainained at 50 ◦C for 10 min, and then Pt species were added by syringe ump under magnetic stirring. Different concentrations of Pt sinle atom could be embedded in the surface of Ni NCs by varying he amount of added Pt precursor. The Pt1/Ni NCs manifested much igher activity and selectivity toward selective hydrogenation of 3- itrostyrene than Pt single atoms loaded on other substrates (such s, active carbon, TiO2, SiO2, and ZSM-5). The Pt1/Ni NCs owned ow energy barriers for H dissociation and diffusion so that realzed spontaneous dissociation of H2 on Pt sites as well as H atoms eadily diffusion on Ni NCs.\nMoreover, some groups used single atom alloys (SAAs) catalysts o depict this unique composition (low content components in the lloy catalysts isolated from each other). For example, Sykes’s group abricated Pd-Cu single atom alloys (SAAs) catalysts for selective ydrogenation of styrene and acetylene [84]. They demonstrated hat isolated Pd atoms on partial Cu surface fundamentally decrease he energy barrier to both the adsorption and desorption process f H species by high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy.\ncurrents graphed for comparison (left), (c) The plotted FT-EXAFS spectra obtained dercoordination of Pt atoms in low-Pt content samples.\nThe feature of unforced H dissociation at Pd sites and weak binding to Cu finally contributed to the higher catalytic activity than pure Cu or Pd metal. Sykes’s group also prepared Pt-Cu SAAs catalysts by injecting desired amounts of H2PtCl6 into a suspension of Cu/ -Al2O3 [85]. Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM characterization showed that there was less than 1 Pt atom in every 100 Cu atoms. Although isolated Pt atom geometries enabled the activation and spillover of H, the inferior capability to cleavage the C C bond resulted in loss of selectivity and catalyst deactivation. The PtCu SAAs supported on -Al2O3 well solved this contradiction, and showed high activity and selectivity for butadiene hydrogenation under mild conditions. In addition to isolate noble atoms (e.g. Pt, Pd) on transition metal surface, isolating transition metal in noble metal lattice is also an effective strategy for enhancing the catalytic performance. Xiong et al. synthesized different components of PdxCu1-TiO2 hybrid structures in aqueous solution containing TiO2 NSs [86]. They prepared a series of PdxCu1 alloys by adjusting the concentration of Pd and Cu precursors. Among them, the Pd7Cu1-TiO2 photocatalyst with isolated Cu atoms into the Pd lattice showed high selectivity for conversion of CO2 to CH4. A series of characterizations demonstrated that the isolating Cu atoms in Pd lattice not only provides a paired Cu-Pd sites for CO2 adsorption, but also elevates the d-band centers of Cu sites for CO2 activation.\nDoping foreign metals on ultrafine nanomaterials (e.g. ultrathin NWs, NSs) can further magnify the advantages of ultrathin structure, consequently leading to the promising catalytic performance. Zeng et al. prepared Rh-doped Pt NWs (Fig. 9) by co-reduction of Rh(acac)2 and Pt(acac)2 in didecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) and OAm mixed solutions with the introduction of W(CO)6 [87]. In this synthetic system, DDAB acted as a soft template, W(CO)6 increased the reduction kinetics for the formation of such NWs. For ORR performance, the Rh-doped Pt NWs/C catalyst showed enhanced mass activity and durability as compared with Pt NWs/C and Pt/C catalysts. The EXAFS and DFT calculations indicated that doping Rh into the Pt NWs not only changed the compressive strain and ligand effect of the NWs, but also heightened the vacancy formation energy of the Pt atoms, leading to the enhanced\nJ.

For ultrathin NSs, very recently, Wang’s group ynthesized Co-substituted Ru NSs, in which atomically dispersed o were isolated in Ru lattice [88]. The Co-substituted Ru NSs were ynthesized by co-reduction of Ru and Co precursors in the mixed olutions containing OAm and heptanol. Via increasing the conent of Co precursor in the above synthetic system, Ru-Co alloy was ormed. DFT studies reveals that single Co atom substituted nanosructures could significantly reduce the energy barrier of water issociation as demonstrated by DFT calculation, leading to the uch higher performance toward HER than Ru-Co alloy and other eported Pt-free catalysts. What’s more, the catalytic activity can be further improved by uning the coordination environment of single atoms with multiple toms. For the first time, Hong et al. achieved the fabrication of Cut dual sites alloyed with Pd nanorings (NRs) by two-step approach 89]. In the first step, the composite of atomically dispersed Cu on ltrafine Pd NRs was generated by adding Cu substances into Pd NSs nder the CO atmosphere. Then the as-obtained Pd/Cu NRs were ut into hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution containing tiny amounts f Pt precursor and the desirable catalyst was obtained under ultra-\n, (e) EDX line-scanning profile, (f) Pt and Rh XPS spectra recorded from Rh-doped\nsonic bath for 45 min. The EXAFS analysis showed strong Cu-Pt coordination peaks without the characteristic peaks of Cu-Cu and Pt-Pt, suggesting that Cu-Pt dual sites were dispersed on the Pd NRs at the atomic level. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that atomically dispersed Cu-Pt dual sites alloyed with Pd NRs possessed outstanding HER catalytic activity as compared with Pt/C.\nIntermetallic compounds\nIntermetallic compounds with fixed stoichiometries and highly ordered atomic structures have attracted tremendous attention in the fields of material chemistry and catalysis. Compared to disordered alloys, the ordered alloy nanostructures can provide strong interactions and orbit rehybridization of atoms to achieve high catalytic performance. However, due to the high order of its structure, the synthesis of intermetallic compounds often requires higher energy, making its synthesis more difficult as compared to alloy compounds. Exploration of new synthetic reactions to prepare intermetallic compounds with specific structures is a challenging task in nanoscience. Previously, Li and co-workers developed\n172 J.

By employing this typical ystem, dozens of bimetallic alloys and intermetallic nanocrysals have been successfully synthesized. However, a systematic egulation of morphologies of intermetallic compounds is still a hallenging task. Recently, three intermetallic Pt3Sn NCs with diferent surface structures (cubic, concave cubic, and defect-rich) ere prepared in N, N-dimethylformamide medium, on the basis f large electronegativity differences between Pt and Sn [95]. By areful investigation of the growth process, a “large electronegtivity difference-induced/etching-assisted/diffusion-terminated” rowth mechanism was proposed for the preparation of interetallic compounds. Interestingly, Pt3Sn NCs with different surface tructures show obvious surface-dependent catalytic properties for\n3Co close along [100]. Reprinted with permission from Ref. [98].

Apart from regulating the electronegativities of metals, the surface structure of intermetallic compounds can also be regulated by using small molecules or functional groups. Huang and coworkers reported a wet-chemical approach to prepare Pd3Pb intermetallic nanomaterials with three different concave degrees [96], namely, nanocubes, slightly concave nanocubes, and concave nanocubes. A series of contrast experiments revealed that halogen ions were responsible for the formation of nanocubes. Meanwhile, the formation of Pd3Pb slightly concave nanocubes and concave nanocubes could be attributed to the effects of −CHO and −COOH groups, respectively. Amongst intermetallic compounds, Cu-based intermetallic nanostructures, such as Au-Cu, Pd-Cu, and Pt-Cu have attracted more attention due to their wide applications in elec-\nJ.

For example, Li designed a seed-mediated ethod for the preparation of Cu3Au and CuAu intermetallic comounds [97], in which Au formed the core and Cu diffused into he lattice of Au. Pd-Cu and Pt-Cu alloys can be obtained simiarly by simply replacing Au crystals with Pd or Pt, respectively. urthermore, Yang and coworkers found that higher temperatures nd longer reaction times are essentially required for the formaion of ordered Au-Cu lattices [53]. Such ordered nanostructures nd applications widely in energy-related catalytic reactions and xhibit excellent catalytic performance.\nSo far, solution-phase methods have been generally used for he synthesis of intermetallic compounds. Before the evaluation f performance, the obtained intermetallic compound has to be oaded on a carbon support. However, due to weak interactions f the catalyst with the carbon support, the catalyst readily forms ggregates or gets dissolved during the reaction process, resulting n reduced catalytic durability. In addition, the surfactant attached n the surface of intermetallic compound also affects the catalytic erformance. Thus, developing a new method to resolve the above ssues is expected to further improve its activity and stability. Recently, MOF-confined strategy was employed for the syntheis of intermetallic compounds. For example, Wu and coworkers esigned an ingenious strategy to synthesize ordered Pt3Co ntermetallic compound [98], which was embedded into zeolitic midazolate framework (ZIF) -derived carbon nanostructures Fig. 10a-f). In the first step of the synthesis, Co-doped ZIF nanocrysals were prepared as the precursors for Co-doped carbon. Then Pt anoparticles were supported onto Co-doped carbon, which was hen followed by a facile thermal treatment step. The atomically ispersed Co atoms diffused into Pt nanoparticles during the high emperature treatment, which ultimately resulted in the formation f highly ordered Pt3Co intermetallic structures. In the synthesis of hese Pt3Co intermetallic compounds, the doping amount of Co and ubsequent heating temperatures for Co diffusion were found to e crucial. Taking advantage of their unique geometries and elec-\nHydrogenation of acetylene\ntion, FOR stands for formic acid oxidation reaction.\ntronic structures, the ordered Pt3Co particles possessed not only high onset potential (1.05 versus 1.02 V), and half-wave potentials (0.92 versus 0.86 V), in comparison to Pt/C, but also superior stability (losing only 12 mV on half-wave potential after 30,000 potential cycles between 0.6 and 1.0 V). Based on the MOF materials, other intermetallic compounds with different compositions can also be prepared. Chen and co-workers reported another similar method to prepare intermetallic PdZn nanoparticles within ZIF-8 derived carbon using a MOF-confined co-reduction strategy (Fig. 10g–i) [99]. Results of characterization demonstrated that these sub-2 nm PdZn nanoparticles with atomically-ordered structure were effectively embedded into the regular pores of the ZIF-8-C. The ultra-small intermetallic PdZn nanoparticles showed higher selectivity towards the hydrogenation of acetylene than the larger-sized intermetallic PdZn. Theoretical studies reveal that ultra-small intermetallic PdZn nanoparticles are more favorable for acetylene hydrogenation and ethylene desorption. More importantly, this strategy is also applicable for the synthesis of intermetallic PtZn nanoparticles, and is expected to be employed for the synthesis of other intermetallic nanoparticles with ultrasmall sizes by rational functionalization of MOFs. This work not only enriches our knowledge of the synthetic methodology of intermetallic compounds, but also provides a rich source of information regarding the composition, size, and structure of the intermetallic compounds for applications in industrial catalysis.\nConclusions and prospects\nDue to the growing demand for global energy and fast depletion of non-renewable energy resources, development of high-efficiency catalysts has become a major requirement for sustainable development and the national economy. The traditional “controllable synthesis” methods still fail to address some structure-activity relationships well, and there are contradictions in elaborating some principles. Precise synthesis of catalysts came\n1 oday\ni r c o o ( P h P c d o\nd p o m o a n c t d c s m t a c t c o f t t ( s t t i b t g p i s l n p\nA\nC o\nR\n[\n[ [ [\n[\n[ [ [\n[\n[ [ [\n[ [\n[ [\n[\n[ [ [\n[\n[ [ [\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[ [\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[ [\n74 J.

Several atomic-level ontrollable synthetic methods have been employed for synthesis f nanocrystals with precision. Through these methods, a series f surface structure-determined nanocrystals were synthesized Table 1), which included the highly opened three-dimensional t3Ni nanoframes, monolayer Ru atoms covered porous Pd octaedral, monoatomic Co substituted Ru nanosheets, intermetallic t3Sn NCs, etc. These well-defined structures exhibited excellent atalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction, semihyrogenation of alkynes, hydrogen evolution reaction, formic acid xidation reaction, etc.\nAlthough some methods of controlled synthesis have been eveloped, it is still complicated to synthesize nanocrystals with recision, since the mechanism of nucleation in the synthesis f nanocrystals is unclear. In-situ XAFS technique provides the ost realistic data for structural changes in the nucleation process f nanocrystals. It helps to objectively and quantitatively evalute the nanocrystal nucleation and growth processes. Once the ucleation mechanism is well understood, the rational design of atalysts becomes possible. Another important aspect of nanosynhesis at the atomic scale is the effect of ligands. The type and osage of ligands greatly influence the electronic structure and atalytic properties of nanocrystals. It is very important to undertand the coordination interactions between the ligand and the etal nanoparticles through theoretical calculations and qualitaive characterizations. For the catalytic reaction process, it is often ssumed that the obtained catalyst structure is correlated to its atalytic performance. In fact, it should be noted that the iniial structure of the catalyst may not be the real structure of the atalyst in the reaction. Uniformities in the size and morphology f the nanocrystal at an atomic level provide an essential basis or observation and study of structural changes, before and after he reaction. A detailed characterization of the catalyst after reacion is necessary. Furthermore, relation between the fine structure coordination number, bond length, coordination atom, oxidation tate, bond polarity, etc.) of the catalyst and its performance, need o be studied. The observation of the structure and performance esting at the surface/interface of nanosystems still needs further mprovements and innovation. Some model catalytic systems can e designed to understand the correlation between catalyst strucure and performance at the atomic level, which may enable to set uidelines for developing catalysts with excellent performance. At resent, the strategy for nanocrystal synthesis at the atomic level s just limited to the laboratory-level of research. More attention hould be paid to large-scale production of catalysts with controlable structure. Our final goal is to achieve precise synthesis of anocrystal structure at the atomic level, while also achieving mass roduction of the catalysts.\ncknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of hina (2016YFA0202801), the National Natural Science Foundation f China (21671117, 21871159, 21890383).\neferences\n[1] L.
