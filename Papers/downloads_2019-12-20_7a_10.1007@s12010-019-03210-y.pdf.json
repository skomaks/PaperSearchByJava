      "text" : "With the rapid development of the global population and economy, a huge amount of agricultural and food waste is being generated worldwide and becoming a recognized public issue. These organic wastes can cause several environmental and public health problems if not handled properly [1]. Bioconversion of agricultural and food wastes to value-added products, such as fuels, materials, and chemicals, has attracted a lot of attention and many interests in the field of sustainable development.\nInsect-based biorefinery has been seen as a promising approach to recycling agricultural and food wastes for value-added products in the last decades. Currently, many different species of insect had been invested for their applicability as an agent to convert agricultural and food wastes [2–5]. Black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae (BSFL) is one of the most promising candidates because of its favorable characteristics such as easy cultivation, fast-growing, and worldwide distribution [6, 7]. BSFL has great potential to consume various organic waste in a large amount during its life span. A range of organic wastes including animal manure, manure [1], agricultural residues [8–10], and food processing wastes [11] was successfully converted by black soldier fly into larval biomass. Furthermore, BSFL generates half of the residue amount of compost as compared to fresh biowaste composting process, thus, releasing lower emission to the environment [7], and potential to replace conventional feed protein sources to lower the environmental impact of food production [6]. Moreover, BSFL has antimicrobial activity against the growth of gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and filamentous fungi which will evoke a safe application for human consumptions [12].\nOne problem that could limit the development of insect-based biorefinery is the low market price of the insect biomass [13]. One of the solutions is to increase the value of products derived from insect biomass. Value-added applications or products could promote the growth of interest in the industry of using insects as bio-converter. Several products could be separated and purified from the insect biomass including proteins, lipids, chitin, and pigments. The meal derived from insect biomass was proven to be a potential protein and several essential ingredient sources to substitute fish and soybean [14–16]. The insect oil had also been investigated in many studies for the production of biofuels [17, 18]. Currently, there was no report discussed the behavior and application of lipid from BSFL as a carrier of drug or bioactive in the form of oil-in-water (O/W) nano-emulsions.\nNano-emulsions are formulated by adding emulsifiers into the mixture of oil and water with the aids of physical homogenization. The emulsifiers are adsorbed onto the oil-water interface to reduce the interfacial tension and form dispersed droplets [19]. Nevertheless, nano-emulsions are thermodynamically unstable systems that require the emulsifiers to sustain their stability during preparation and storage. Avariety of emulsifiers can be used to stabilize nano-emulsions, such as anionic, nonionic, cationic, double tail, or Gemini structure emulsifier [20, 21]. In some cases, the formation, stability, and functional properties of nano-emulsions can be further improved by using combinations of different emulsifiers [19, 22, 23]. For example, Riquelme et al. found that the emulsifier mixture of 5% lecithin and 1% tween 80/quillaja saponin can enhance the thermal stability of avocado oil-based nano-emulsions, which could be useful for processing emulsion-based food products [24]. Another study published by Cheong et al. also showed that the kenaf seed oil-in-water nano-emulsions can be stabilized using ternary emulsifier mixtures [25]. Nevertheless, there is currently a relatively poor understanding of the impact of mixed emulsifier systems on nano-emulsions formation and properties.\nTo promote the value of BSFL oil based on the biorefinery concept, this study aimed to develop a novel nano-emulsion with BSFL oil as a lipophilic compound combining nonionic TPGS and amphoteric HL as the emulsifiers. TPGS and HL can be functionalized as an excellent solubilizer, emollient, permeation, emulsifier, and bioavailability enhancer to form mixed nano-emulsions systems that intended to improve their physicochemical characteristics [26, 27]. Since physicochemical characteristics of colloids play a key role in the development of drug delivery systems [28, 29], transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, and fluorescence polarization were utilized to investigate properties of BSFL oil nanoemulsions. Furthermore, the effect of the nano-emulsions constituents on their physical properties and storage stability was also evaluated. The results derived from this work would provide useful information for designing BSFL oil-based nano-emulsions that suitable for a wide range of applications such as drug, nutrient, cosmetic delivery systems."

The larval paste was then extracted with 10 times the volume of hexane at 60 °C in an enclosed glass vessel and stirred at 150 rpm for 1 h followed by settling for 30 min. The hexane layer was separated from the water layer followed by filtrating through a glass microfiber filter (Grade GF/D, Whatman®). The extraction process was repeated twice to obtain the oil. The collected hexane layer containing BSFL oil was then fed into a rotary vacuum evaporator at 45 °C and 20 mmHg to separate the hexane from the crude oil.\nThe crude BSFL oil was purified sequentially by degumming, dewaxing, and bleaching. Briefly, for degumming and dewaxing, 100 g of BSFL crude oil was heated to 70 °C followed by adding 0.2 ml 99% H3PO4 (w/v) and stirred for 30 min. Then, 10 g of 15% NaOH (w/v) was added into the crude oil and reacted for 30 min to neutralize the oil. After neutralization, the crude oil was centrifuged at 6000×g for 5 min. The bleaching process was performed by adding 0.5 g of activated carbon and 1.5 g of acidic clay to the degummed and dewaxed oil. The sample was then stirring at 150 rpm for 30 min followed by filtration through a qualitative filter paper (Grade No. 1, Whatman®).

Figure 1 shows the TEM images for freshly prepared nano-emulsions with various surfactant ratios of HL/TPGS as SOR = 60% and oil content = 1%. One can see that the existence of nearly spherical particles and the size distribution is different for each formulation. This indicates that BSFL oil adding with HL and TPGS can form nano-scale colloids in water. Besides, the size of nano-colloids for pure HL is larger than that of those for TPGS and HL/TPGS = 75/25, suggesting that the incorporation of TPGS into HL nano-emulsions would induce the molecular rearrangement. A similar decrease effect of TPGS on the size of Tween 80 nano-emulsions was also found [31], whereas inversely results were reported for poly(lactide)/TPGS nanoparticle systems [32]. Generally, the bulky of PEG(2000) group can impart sufficient curvature of particles [33], but neighbor constituent interaction shall not be neglected in the nano-colloids. As will be confirmed in the following section, the sizes of BSFL oil nano-emulsions visualized by TEM were virtually agreed with those determined by DLS."

      "text" : "Figure 2 illustrates the average particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential of BSFL oil nano-emulsions with various surfactant ratios of HL/TPGS at different SOR and oil content obtained from DLS measurement. The APS of BSFL oil nano-emulsions was found to be significantly affected by the SOR and surfactant ratio (p < 0.0001) rather\nthan oil content (p = 0.1921), where increasing SOR and surfactant ratio causes a decrease in the size of nano-emulsions. This result may be explained by the fact that an abundant amount of surfactant will provide a stronger reduced ability in surface tension and higher contact probability to interact with oil rather than low SOR. Such an effect may tighten molecular distance, resulting in a decrease in particle size. In the case of oil content, a higher amount of oil in nano-emulsions does not cost any noticeable change in particle size. This indicates that the nano-emulsion size is more significantly affected by the partition equilibrium of surfactant in solution by compared with oil content.\nAs for the surfactant ratio effect, the presence of TPGS significantly maintained the particle in small size even in the lowest TPGS concentration at the surfactant ratio of HL/TPGS = 75/ 25. The appearance of TPGS can give the bulky PEG head group in the HL nano-emulsion surface, inducing high curvature of particles [33, 34]. Furthermore, the concept of molecular packing parameter is widely invoked in the literature to rationalize and even predict selfassembly structure in surfactant solutions [35]. Herein, TPGS known has a conical structure with packing parameter ¼–½, which causes the arrangement of molecule tighter and curvier. HL is known as a rectangle structure with packing parameters ½–1/3, which causes the arrangement of the molecule to become weaker and less curvy [35]. This confirmed that the TPGS can provide a downsizing effect on HL nano-emulsions. It is interesting to note in Fig. 2b that the polydispersity index of nano-emulsions with mixed binary surfactants is larger than that of single HL or TPGS nano-emulsions. This phenomenon may be related to the miscibility between TPGS and HL. Besides, the results of zeta potential (Fig. 2d) display that an increase of HL amount in the nano-emulsions induces a decrease in the zeta potential. This may be due to HL used in this work is negatively charged [36]."

      "text" : "Viscosity measurement of BSFL oil nano-emulsions solution was performed to understand the flow behavior. Figure 2c shows that the flow index of BSFL oil nano-emulsions with various surfactant ratios of HL/TPGS at different SOR and oil content. As the surfactant ratio of HL/ TPGS ≤ 50/50, the flow index value was close to 1, suggesting that the flow behavior of these formulations was nearly Newtonian liquid. Further increasing HL amount over 50%, the flow index of samples < 1 was found. This implies that the presence of a rich-HL amount in the nano-emulsions may changes the flow behavior of the dispersion become shear thinning. Such a result may be associated with the modification of nanostructure of dispersion by HL amount reported elsewhere [37]."

      "heading" : "Stability Study and Visual Observation",
      "text" : "The stability of nano-emulsions is one of the crucial aspects that should not be neglected for all consumer goods since it is improbable for direct uses after production and necessary need for long term storage. Using visual observation, the appearance of the NE is different for each composition. Figure 3a shows that the most transparent solution was in the surfactant ratio of 75/25, which gives very high storage stability until 365 days. Emulsion with high transparency has a low refractive index which related to the small particle involve inside the solution. Therefore, the transparency of the nano-emulsion has the same tendencies with the particle size trend. These phenomena are in the same agreement with another report [38] where combining of water-soluble surfactant and a water-insoluble phospholipid can result in a single surfactant micelle, mixed micelle, or mixed dispersions. Furthermore, it was found that a micellar or mixed micellar formation will generate an isotropically clear solution [39].\nWhile HL was used alone as a surfactant in the BSFL oil nano-emulsions, a white cream layer was observed on the surface of the solution after reach 2–7 days (Fig. 3b). Although the HL nano-emulsions have the lowest zeta potential value, the huge size of particles was found and phase separation appeared. In most cases, the destabilization of nano-emulsions dispersion is caused by the phase transition, gravitational force, and flocculation or Ostwald ripening [40]. Creaming is one of the frequently observed phenomena in this system because of the oil phase density is lower than the aqueous phase density. Moreover, HL known has low solubility in water which more likely acts as a hydrophobic surfactant. So that the oiling-off does not happen, which means that the oil phase does not separate from the surfactant. It is proved that HL has an excellent performance to incorporate the oil phase in their environment."

      "heading" : "Endothermic Phase Behavior",
      "text" : "The differential scanning calorimetry was conducted as a thermal analysis to investigate not only the endothermic phase behavior of the nano-emulsions but also another related interaction of surfactant, oil, and the environment. The resulting thermograms of BSFL oil nanoemulsions varied with different surfactant ratios of HL/TPGS at various oil content and SOR is shown in Fig. 4. Two phase transition regions were found in the temperature range of − 4 to 37 °C (phase transition region 1, P1) and 56–68 °C (phase transition region 2, P2). Moreover, there are several fused transitions, combining become one broad phase transition that was indicating the membrane phase separation. At fixed oil content and SOR, one can find that the endothermic curve of HL nano-emulsions exhibits the larger size of P2 without obvious alteration in size of P1 compared with the presence of TPGS. According to the report of Nakagawa et al. [41], P2 belongs to pure HL dispersions and then P1 may be related to the appearance of BSFL oil. This implies that adding of TPGS would disturb the molecular packing of HL nano-emulsions. TPGS owning the PEG head group may provide a steric effect toward the neighbor molecule in the nano-emulsions. By compared with Fig. 4a and b, an increase of SOR induces a more obvious size of P2, and changes in the size of P1 at a low amount of TPGS. An increase of surfactant amount affects phase transition region which related to surfactant and BSFL oil interaction. This indicates that the surfactant may attribute to the original ordered crystalline structure of BSFL oil having a decrease upon the presence of TPGS [42].\nFrom Fig. 4a, there is a slight change of phase transition shape in SOR 30%, and become more obvious at SOR 60% (Fig. 4b) from sharp multiple transition peak become one broad phase transition. This result suggests that higher TPGS concentration inhibits phase transition behavior change of BSFL oil and indicates an interaction between the surfactant and oil phase, which is contributed to the decreasing crystallinity of membrane with the presence of PEG head group [43]. On the other hand, the phase transition region of nano-emulsions with pure TPGS appears in the temperature range of 28.7–41.3 °C with a melting point at 37.3 °C (data are not shown). Nevertheless, the endothermic peak of TPGS was not observed in the DSC thermograms of NE, suggesting a complete molecular dispersion of TPGS in both oil and aqueous phase [44].\nTable 2 presents the main phase transition temperature (ΔTm), enthalpy change (ΔH), and half-width transition temperature (ΔT1/2) for every recorded peak from DSC measurement. The result suggests that increasing TPGS concentration at SOR30% will cost decreasing ΔTm1 from initially 20.33 °C become 15.83 °C, where the changes become pronounce at SOR 60% and reach 8.06 °C. This result may attribute to the creation of the less ordered structure or\nnumerous lattice defects of the inner structure of the lipid matrix and/or the small size effect which could be explained by Gibbs-Thomson equations [45]. On the other hand, ΔTm2 at SOR 30% does not have any shifting behavior. However, increasing SOR to 60% possesses a decrease in the main phase transition temperature. This result suggests that in low TPGS concentration, the interaction between TPGS and BSFL oil is more dominant rather than the interaction with HL. Moreover, increasing SOR would make the surfactant interaction firmer. From ΔH1 data, there are no significant changes in SOR30%, but it rapid decreases while increasing TPGS concentration at SOR 60%. This finding suggests that higher TPGS concentration will give better thermal stability in NE dispersion, as they exhibit small changes in heat flow [46]. Furthermore, ΔH2 which belongs to the HL phase transition exhibit the same behavior even in high or low SOR which the presence of TPGS even in lowest concentration can reduce the phase transition region that makes the NE thermally stable.\nIn the case of ΔT1–1/2 and ΔT2–1/2 value, it clearly reveals that mixing TPGS and HL will decrease the phase transition temperature width which in the same evidence with sharpening the transition peak. This result is on contrary to [47], which explains that the bigger particle will crystallize at faster rates as compared to smaller ones. However, when mixing TPGS and HL will cost decreasing particle size and accelerate the phase transition rates."

The high fluidity of a membrane may have good performance since its ability to squeeze and deform through the various physiological barrier [48]. The polarization of DPH inside the dispersion was found in the same value even in the different amounts of surfactant ratio and oil content (Fig. 5). It is possible that this result was affected by the forming of a gel phase under the observation temperature at 25 °C. Increasing SOR makes the polarization value of nano-emulsions decrease for all oil content 1% and 2%. This implies that the intranano-emulsions fluidity can be elevated by increasing the surfactant amount.

    "abstractText" : "Insect-based biorefinery is seen as a potential alternative approach to manufacturing foods, feeds, and fuel because of the increasing demand for renewable and sustainable products. Insect oil and protein are the two major components that can be quantitatively obtained from insect farming. However, very few attempts have been conducted to utilize insect oil for the production of value-added products. In this study, the oil extracted from the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae (BSFL) was used as a novel feedstock for preparing nano-emulsions. The nano-emulsions were prepared with BSFL oil, hydrogenated lecithin (HL), and d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) in water using pre-homogenization followed by ultrasonication. The morphology and the particle size of nano-emulsions were affected by ratios of HL to TPGS. Moreover, the nano-emulsions showed a nearly Newtonian liquid behavior and the presence of TPGS was able to improve the storage stability of HL nano-emulsions. The addition of TPGS could eliminate the phase transition region of HL nano-emulsions but did not provide a significant change for the molecular mobility in the HL nano-emulsions. In summary, the BSFL oil could be used as a renewable feedstock for formulating nano-emulsions from the aspect of high value-added applications and physicochemical characteristics of the nano-emulsions could be adjusted by the mixed surfactant ratio, surfactant to oil ratio, and oil content.",
