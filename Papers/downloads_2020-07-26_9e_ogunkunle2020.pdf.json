      "text" : "Nano-remediation Phytotoxicity Cadmium Titanium dioxide nanoparticles Antioxidant enzymes Nutritional quality\nA B S T R A C T\nThe study was conducted to investigate the effects of foliar-intervention of nano-TiO2 on Cd toxicity in cowpea plants. Cowpea plants were exposed to Cd toxicity at 10mg/kg soil for 21 days and afterwards, subjected to six episodes of foliar application of nano-TiO2 intervention. Results showed that foliar-applied nano-TiO2 significantly promoted chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll contents after Cd stress as compared to Cd-stressed plants without the intervention. Interestingly, Cd contents of roots, shoots and grains were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) after nano-TiO2 sprays compared to Cd-stressed plants. However, the Cd contents in edible tissues (leaves and seeds) after interventions remained above recommended threshold. Furthermore, nano-TiO2 interventions promoted stress enzymes activity in both roots and leaves as well as increased Zn, Mn and Co levels in seeds compared to Cd-stressed plants without intervention. Estimated daily intake of Cd in leaves and seeds for adult subpopulation exceeded the WHO recommended daily intake by some folds in Cd-stressed and nano-TiO2treated plants. The health risk quotient (HQ) for adult subpopulation exceeded unitary in seeds from nano-TiO2 treatments (HQ=1.75 and 1.96, respectively) while no potential risk was obtained for leaves. Overall, foliar application of nano-TiO2 portends significant ameliorative potential for Cd toxicity in cowpea plants."

      "text" : "The rapid pace of industrialization and increased release of agrochemicals into the soil environment has resulted in wide-spread concerns about the likelihood of build-up of heavy metals (HMs) in agricultural soil (Wong et al., 2007). The contamination of agricultural soil with toxic HMs has become a menace throughout the world, and most importantly in developing countries due to increased agricultural activities to meet the teeming population demands. Ingestion of HMs through the food chain has been found to be the primary source of human exposure to toxic HMs in agrarian area (Liu et al., 2007). Cadmium is one of the most dangerous HMs because of its high mobility in living organisms and the small concentration at which its effects manifests (Benavides et al., 2005). It is considered a major factor in yield limitation of plants due to its high accumulation and toxicity to crop plants (Rizwan et al., 2017). Although Cd is not essential for plant\ngrowth, its bioaccumulation index in tissues of plants greatly exceeds all other HMs (Kabata-Pendias and Pendias, 1992). Cadmium may accumulate to chronic level in human body for many years, so intake of foods having high Cd content may portend potential human health risk (Jackson and Alloway, 1992).\nNanotechnology is a recent field with diverse applications in many areas of study. The advantageous use of nanoparticles (NPs) in agriculture have been proved (López-Vargas et al., 2018). Nanotechnology is being used in the application of nanomaterials such as nanofertilizers, NPs, or nanopesticides for genetic improvement, nutrient management, treatment of plant diseases, and to aid plant growth (De la Rosa et al., 2017; Rizwan et al., 2017; Munir et al., 2018). These nanomaterials can speed up seed germination, or influence plants tolerability of both biotic and abiotic stresses, promoting efficient management of nutrients, improving plant growth while lessening the environmental impact compared to the conventional methods (Genady et al., 2017).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2020.01.009 Received 31 October 2019; Received in revised form 4 January 2020; Accepted 17 January 2020\n⁎ Corresponding author.

All rights reserved.\nT\nRecently, the idea of nanoremediation using metal-based NPs as environmentally-friendly and cost-effective amendments for the remediation of metal-contaminated soils is becoming popular gradually (Adrees et al., 2015; Abbas et al., 2017; Rehman et al., 2017). Several studies have documented the potential of NPs exposure to plants in promoting growth and at the same time, reduce metal concentrations in plant biomasses when compared to control (Wang et al., 2012a, b; Konate et al., 2017; Venkatachalam et al., 2017; Rizwan et al., 2019). In addition, silicon NPs was also found to alleviate Cr toxicity in pea seedling (Tripathi et al., 2015) while the exogenous application of Fe3O4 NPs also promoted the growth of wheat and decreased metal uptake (Konate et al., 2017). Titanium dioxide has also drawn considerable research attention because of its chemical reliability, affordability, ease of access and its non-toxicity potential. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles has proven promising as efficient supply of plants’ nutrients for improved biomass production due to its ability to promote nitrogen assimilation, photo-reduction activity of photosystem II and removal of reactive oxygen species in plants (Raliya et al., 2015). Studies have also shown that combined application of sol SiO2 (nano-SiO2) and TiO2 (nano-TiO2) could increase nitrate reductase in soybean, promote water retention potential and enhance antioxidant system (Lu et al., 2002). Titanium dioxide applied through roots or leaves at lower concentrations has been reported to enhance crop yield by stimulating enzyme activities, improve chlorophyll contents and photosynthesis, increase nutrient uptake and heighten stress tolerance (Gao et al., 2013; Antisari et al., 2014; Ji et al., 2017).\nCowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) is a legume grown extensively in the sub-Saharan Africa, and also comprise major sources of proteineous diets of Southern Nigerian people. The seeds provide valuable dietary protein of about 25 % to humans and animals (Bressani, 1985) while the leaves are important nutritious vegetable to humans (IPM CRSP, 2000). Sequel to the above, this present study aims to evaluate the potential of foliar-applied nano-TiO2 as remediation intervention for Cd toxicity in cowpea plants by assessing its effects on Cd bioaccumulation, stress enzymes, micronutrients of seeds and dietary health risk in the plant."

      "text" : "The experiment was carried out in the screen house of the Botanical garden of University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria between March and June 2019. Seeds of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata- IT07K-292-10) used in this study were c from collected from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, Nigeria. The soil used in this experiment was loamy soil that was collected from a fallow land at the Research farm of the University. The physico-chemical characteristics of the test soil are thus- pH=7.80, EC= 0.14 dS/m, CEC=6.20 cmol/kg, organic matter content= 3.05 %, total nitrogen= 1.68 %, total potassium=6.8 %, total phosphorus= 3.2 % and total Cd=0.89mg/kg, as already reported in our previously study (Ogunkunle et al., 2018a). The soil mass was air-dried, ground into powders to pass through a 2-mm mesh and kept for use.\nSoil mass (1.7 kg each) was filled into 12 round plastic containers with 16 cm by 14 cm dimension. Soils in 9 pots out of the 12 pots were spiked with CdCl2 at the rate of 10mg Cd/kg soil in dry particulate form. The cadmium salt was applied to the soil according to the method in Ogunkunle et al. (2018b) and Akanbi-Gada et al. (2019). The Cdspiked soils were allowed to age for 14 days with continuous agitation (mixing) and several cycles of saturation with deionized water (DW) and drying. Seeds (4 seeds/container) were sown into the plastic container and after emergence, they were thinned to two seedlings/container. The seedlings were allowed to grow for 21 days before subjection to foliar-applied solution of nano-TiO2. Six containers from the 9 Cd-spiked containers were selected and divided into 2 groups. Plants in\neach group were subjected to foliar application of nano-TiO2 at the rate of 100mg/l and 200mg/l, respectively for the two groups. The control group and remaining Cd-spiked group serving as the negative control (3 containers each, respectively) were foliar-irrigated with DW. Calibrated hand spray (400ml volume) was utilized and the applications were carried out in three cycles per week for two consecutive weeks. The spray application was directed on the plants leaves without protection of soil surface against unintended inputs (with possibility of spills into soil surfaces) in order to mimic field practice. The characteristic properties of the nano-TiO2 particles (< 100 nm) employed in this present study has been document in Ogunkunle et al. (2020) and presented in supplementary information (SI 1). In all, the treatments were as follows in triplicates: control, sole Cd treatment, Cd+100mg nTiO2/l and Cd +200mg nTiO2/l. Afterwards, cowpea plants were allowed to grow under ambient condition in a screen house for 49 days and plant tissues were harvested for various analyses. The average monthly temperature and rainfall of the location for the four months of experimental study was 27.7 °C and 361.5mm, respectively. Immediately after harvest, whole plant samples were subjected to several washes with tap water and finally with DW twice. The root parts were washed in 1.0 mM EDTA to desorb adhering Cd particles from root surfaces and later washed with DW. Samples were separated into roots, leaves and seeds, and divided into two parts. A part of the tissue samples was oven dried at 70 °C till constant weight was achieved and kept for elemental analysis while the other parts comprising roots and leaves were kept in cold ice packs for immediate biochemical analysis."

The protocols for the determination of enzymes activity [ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)] have been previously described (Ogunkunle et al., 2018b). For crude extract used for determination of APX activity, approximately 0.5 g of fresh root or leaf sample was homogenized in 4ml of 100mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) consisting of 2mM EDTA, 4mM dithiothreitol, and 2 % PVP (Xu and Chen, 2011). The reaction homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 25min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected for APX activity according to Nakano and Asada (1981). Crude extracts for CAT and SOD were prepared according to Lee and Lee (2000). Briefly, 1 g of sample (root or leaf) was homogenized in 100mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) that contained 0.1 mM ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 % PVP and 0.5 % Triton X-100 at 4 °C. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000×g for 20min at 4 °C, and supernatant collected for determination of enzyme activity. Activity of CAT was assayed according to the method of Aebi (1974) while SOD activity was assayed using the method of Beyer and Fridovich (1987). All absorbance were read using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer (2300 model, Segar Scientific, Japan).\nThe methods for hotplate digestion of samples, instrumentations for Cd and micro-elements (Zn, Mn, Co and Cu) analysis, and quality control were adopted from Ogunkunle et al. (2017). I g of powdered sample was subjected to digestion by Aqua regia method (HNO3 + HCl; 1:3) till fumes became colorless on a hot plate. The digest was filtered after cooling into a 25 ml-container and later diluted with deionize water to the mark. Concentration of Cd was measured in roots and leaves while Cd, Cu, Zn, Mn and Co were determined in seeds by Flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry using FAAS-Perkin Elmer AAnalyst 200 (San Diego, USA). Quality control and quality assurance in the study was put in place using triplicate digestion, internal standard and plant reference material -cabbage leaves (IAEA 359). The recovery percentage for the elements analyzed ranged from 92 %–105 %."

The dry-to-fresh conversion factor (Fc) of 0.86 was introduced since home-stored grains (such as peas) contains 14 % H2O content (Zhuang et al., 2009) and 0.085 applied for leaves (Rattan et al., 2005). The body weight (BW) of 70 kg was adopted for a typical Nigerian adult (Lanre-Iyanda and Adekunle, 2012; Ogunkunle et al., 2015, 2016). Furthermore, the assessment of non-cancer health risk posed on adult through the dietary consumption of cowpea grains was quantified using the Hazard Quotient (HQ) (USEPA, 2002) calculated as follows:\n= EDI RfD HQ\nwhere, RfD represents the oral reference dose for Cd (1.0× 10−3 mg/ kg/day; USEPA, 2002).\nThe generated data from the experiment were initially subjected to Normality test using the Shapiro-Wilk Normality test.

      "text" : "The application of sole Cd at 10mg/kg soil did not alter the content of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) in the leaves in relation to control (Table 1). Similarly, foliar-applied nano-TiO2 (nTiO2) at 100 and 200mg/l, respectively did not alter the contents of Chl-a. But as expected, Chl-b and T-Chl. contents were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) by 24 % and 12 %, respectively upon Cd exposure to sole Cd. This was consistent with some other reports in literature showing decrease in the pigment contents under Cd-stressed conditions in plants (Vassilev et al., 2005;\nGowthami and Vasantha, 2015). Interestingly, the addition of foliarapplied nTiO2 at 100 and 200mg/l doses counteracted Cd toxicity and significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) chlorophyll b (Chl-b) content by ∼17.8 % and ∼71.4 %, respectively as compared to sole Cd treatment. Similarly, Cd toxicity was ameliorated by foliar-applied nTiO2 treatments at Cd10+100mg nTiO2/l and Cd10+200mg nTiO2/l by enhancing total chlorophyll (T-Chl.) contents by ∼6.8 % and ∼30.5 % (p < 0.05), respectively in relation to sole Cd treatment (Table 1). The variations of the chlorophyll contents after the different treatments were significant [F=1.698, p < 0.244 (Chl-a); F=5.292; p=0.027 (Chl-b) and F=5.025; p=0.030 (T-Chl.)]. Similar ameliorative effect of nano-TiO2 has also been reported on chlorophyll contents in Cdstressed rice seedlings by Ji et al. (2017).\nChlorophylls are essential biochemical components for plants’ photosynthesis but they are also very vulnerable to environmental stressors such as cadmium. Cadmium is a strong toxicant to plants even at significantly low concentration. The main Cd phytotoxicity expression on the photosynthetic activity of plants is the reduction of chlorophyll pigments (Sandalio et al., 2001). It has also been reported that Cd toxicity to plants’ photosynthesis could be reflected in the degradation of chlorophylls or the inhibition of its biosynthesis (Somashekaraiah et al., 1992; Bazzaz et al., 1992; Shahabivand et al., 2012). So expectedly, the presence of Cd, even at low concentration (10mg/kg soil) in this study affected chlorophyll contents (Chl-b and TChl.). The ameliorative effects of foliar-applied nano-TiO2 on Cd toxicity observed in Chl-b and T-Chl. could be adduced to its role in the photosystem II (PSII) electron donation. Hong et al. (2005) have reported that TiO2-NPs can bind to the PSII reaction center complex in leaves and enhance PSII electron donation for efficient photosynthesis. From these results, it can also be hypothesized that the presence of nano-TiO2 in the leaves promote enzymes responsible for chlorophyll synthesis since the particles don’t usually ionize in plant tissues (Song et al., 2013). Nano-TiO2 could increase the level and action of RuBisCO activase which is involved in the Calvin cycle, and promote increased rate of plant photosynthesis resulting in increased plant growth (Raliya et al., 2015). Similar ameliorative effect of TiO2-NPs was reported on photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll contents in rice co-exposed to CdTiO2-NPs (Ji et al., 2017), and Cd-stressed soybean exposed to TiO2-NPs via soil (Singh and Lee, 2016).\nThe Cd contents of roots, leaves and seeds of cowpea are presented in Fig. 1. There was significant uptake of Cd in roots of cowpea plants from all treatments in relation to control. In fact, Cd uptake by roots in sole Cd treatment was ∼5-fold higher than control whereas, exposure of cowpea to both Cd10+100mg nTiO2/l and Cd10+200mg nTiO2/l treatments presented a reduced Cd uptake of ∼4-fold higher than control (Fig. 1). Pea plants have been reported to accumulate Cd mainly in roots as a tolerance strategy, although the accumulation potential of Cd by peas majorly relies on the soluble fraction of Cd in the medium (Sandalio et al., 2001; Singh and Lee, 2016) and by ionic interactions with cell wall constituents (Cohen et al., 1998). However, foliar-application of nano-TiO2 significantly reduced the amount of Cd taken up by the roots. For instance, application of nano-TiO2 at 100mg/l dose imposed significantly reduction of 20 % on root Cd uptake while 200mg/l dose reduced root Cd uptake by ∼15 % (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was obtained in Cd uptake between the two nano-TiO2 interventions (P > 0.05).\nSimilarly, significant amount (p < 0.05) of Cd (∼5.5 fold) was translocated to leaf tissues in plants exposed to sole Cd treatment compared to control (Fig. 2). But contrastingly, foliar-applied nTiO2 (Cd10+100mg/l) significantly reduced Cd translocation to leaves to amounts statistically comparable (p > 0.05) to control. Similarly, Cd content in leaf tissues of plants exposed to Cd10+200mg/l treatment was also reduced (p < 0.05) by 2.5-fold compared to sole Cd (Fig. 2). In consistence with bioaccumulation in leaves, seeds from sole Cd treatment bio-accumulated Cd in ∼7.4-fold in relation to control while nTiO2 application significantly reduced (p < 0.05) Cd bioaccumulation\nMean values with the same letter along the column are statistically the same at P < 0.05 using DMRT; * value for Kruskal-Wallis H and significance level.\nto 4.4- and 5.0-fold, respectively for Cd10+100mg/l and Cd10+200mg/l. The mechanism for reduction of Cd uptake and bioaccumulation in cowpea tissues by foliar-applied nTiO2 in this study is not yet understood but it appears that foliar application of nTiO2 only reduced but did not stop Cd translocation to above-ground biomass. This was apparent in the correlation analysis between root-seed and leaf-seed Cd contents (data not shown). It is could be hypothesised that nano-TiO2 regulated the rate of transpiration in leaves, thereby modulating the transport of Cd within the plant as Cd translocation and follow water transport upwards in the xylem (Greger and Landberg, 1995). Some reports have it that exposure of pea plants to co-application of Cd and TiO2-NPs via soil increased Cd uptake and translocation (Bauddh and Singh, 2012; Singh and Lee, 2016). This report apparently contradicted the results obtained in this study on tissue Cd accumulation. As shown in Fig. 1, co-exposure treatments reduced the Cd contents in plant tissues (roots, leaves and seeds) as compared with sole Cd treatment. This was consistent with reports of Ji et al. (2017) in rice seedlings, though route of exposure of nano-TiO2 was soil medium. The presence of nano-TiO2 particles in the plant tissues could have possibly initiated the production of extracellular polypeptides such polypeptides and phytochelatins (though not studied here) which are able to immobilize Cd in tissues and reduce translocation. The results present foliar application of nano-TiO2 as an effective strategy to reduce the transfer of Cd into food chain from moderately contaminated soils."

      "text" : "The toxic influence of Cd on plants seems a complex phenomenon, of which the mechanisms are not completely understood yet. In roots, activity of APX was significantly altered by Cd toxicity in all treatments (Table 2). Roots of plants exposed to sole Cd treatment presented a reduction of APX activity by ∼3.0 folds compared to control. However, application of nTiO2 at the dose-100mg/l (Cd10+100mg nTiO2/l) did not change APX activity in respect to sole Cd. At Cd10+200mg nTiO2/l dose, APX activity increased by ∼24 % in relation to sole Cd treatment but still significantly lower (p < 0.05) than control. Similarly, APX activity in leaves was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in all treatments compared to control. However, the application of nTiO2 at 200mg/l dose enhanced APX activity in the leaves by ∼92.8 % whereas dose at 100mg/l did not change the activity in relation to sole Cd treatment. For CAT, similar reduction in activity was observed in all treatments as compared to control (Table 2). Sole Cd treatment reduced CAT activity by ∼4.0 folds while both nano-TiO2 treatments (Cd10+100mg nTiO2/l and Cd10+200mg nTiO2/l) promoted the activity by an average of 2- fold in relation to sole Cd treatment. However, nTiO2 dose at 200mg/l significantly promoted CAT activity more than 100mg/l dose after Cd exposure. In leaves, toxicity induced by Cd significantly reduced (p < 0.05) CAT activity whereas foliar-application of nTiO2 (both at 100mg/l and 200mg/l concentrations, respectively) promoted the\nactivity significantly (p < 0.05) by an average of 2-fold as compared to sole Cd treatment.\nSOD activity of roots was significantly increased in all treatments in relation to control (Table 2). This is because SOD acts as the first line of defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Dos Santos et al., 2017), and implied that SOD level increased concomitantly with the generation of ROS- superoxide (O2−) species in the roots due to treatments. SOD maintains a low level of O2− in plant cells and averts toxicity in cells, so activation of SOD is a defensive response to curtail phytotoxicity (Lei et al., 2008). Significant increase (p < 0.05) of ∼15.6 % and ∼8.3 % was obtained in roots of plants exposed to nTiO2 at rate of 200mg/l (Cd10+200mg nTiO2/l) and 100mg/l (Cd10+100mg nTiO2/ l), respectively. The least increase (5.6 %) of SOD activity was obtained in roots exposed to sole Cd treatment (Table 2). Studies have shown that enhanced activity of SOD in plants denotes increased tolerance against abiotic toxicity (Ma et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017), and it was believed to reduce oxidative damage (Jahan et al., 2018). Therefore, these results provided evidence that foliar-applied nTiO2 may have assisted in promoting SOD activity in the roots in order to enhancing stress tolerance to Cd. However, SOD activities in leaves were statistically comparable (p > 0.05) to control in all nano-TiO2 treatments while SOD level in sole Cd treatment was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) by ∼6 %. This implies that foliar application of nano-TiO2 ameliorated the toxic effects of Cd on SOD activity in the leaves. NanoTiO2 could protect chloroplast sheath assembly from metal-induced ROS, and able to improve antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT) functions (Cigler et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2013).\nOne of the toxic effect of Cd to plant tissues is oxidative stress which could be caused either by induction of ROS in plant cells or by decreasing enzymatic antioxidants (Sandalio et al., 2001; Balestrasse et al., 2001). MDA is a measure of the level of lipid peroxidation (Draper and Hadley, 1989), and typically indicates the level of oxidative stress. High content of MDA corresponds to low activities of antioxidant enzymes (Zeng and Zhao, 2013). In the present study, the MDA content of cowpea plants increased significantly (P < 0.05) upon exposure to sole Cd in the roots and leaves in relation to control by ∼3- and ∼1.3-fold, respectively (Fig. 2). This is not surprising as Cd portends toxicity to plant tissues even at low concentration, and always results in increased peroxidation of cell membranes of plants (Wang et al., 2012a; Singh and Lee, 2016). Additionally, MDA content in roots was in multiples of leaf content. This alluded to the fact that roots are the first contact with Cd in most environmental conditions, and consequently are more likely to experience phytotoxicity more than any other plant organs such as stem, leaves or fruits. However, foliar application of nTiO2 (Cd10+100mg nTiO2/l) reduced MDA significantly (p < 0.05) by factor of ∼1.5 and ∼1.8, respectively in roots and leaves in relation to sole Cd while at Cd10+200mg nTiO2/l dose, MDA content was reduced by factor of ∼1.0 and ∼2.7, respectively for roots and leaves (Fig. 2). The results showed the positive effect of foliar-applied nTiO2 in alleviating the toxicity of Cd in cowpea at low dose. The variations of the MDA contents in roots and leaves were significant [F=57.14, p < 0.001 and F=288.14, p < 0.001, respectively]. Ti-\nascorbate applied at 5 mg/l via hydroponic solutions has been reported to reduced heavy metal damage in Triticum aestivum L. (Leskó et al., 2002). Ji et al. (2017) also reported positive effect of TiO2 NPs in alleviating Cd toxicity in rice seedlings by reducing MDA content by 22 % at 100mg/l concentration."

      "text" : "The ameliorative influence of foliar-applied nano-TiO2 on Cd toxicity was assessed on selected micro-elements (Table 4) in cowpea seeds. Cd toxicity in cowpea plant imposed reduction in Zn content by ∼12.8 % as compared to no treatment (control) in seeds. Similar reduction in Mn (∼41.5 %) and Co (∼515.9 %) contents were also obtained in seeds exposed to sole Cd treatment. Cadmium has been reported to alter the uptake of micronutrients in plants (Moreno et al., 1999; Rogers et al., 2000), and interfere with the translocation to leaves (Sandalio et al., 2001; Tsyganov et al., 2007) that serve as the natural sinks of mineral nutrients for developing ovules to form seed in peas. This apparently will affect the mobilization of micronutrients from leaves into seeds. Several studies have reported that Cd can enter plant cells via same uptake routes utilized by other cations like Zn, Cu, Fe, Mg and Ca, and interfere with their uptake, transport, and use (Das et al., 1997). Several members of the ZIP transporters and Ca channels responsible for the uptake of essential elements in plants are also involved in the Cd transport through the same route (Perfus-Barbeoch et al., 2002). In fact, nutritional status of leaves pea plant was reportedly altered by Cd with significant reduction in Cu, Zn and Mn contents when exposed to Cd toxicity at 10–50 μM concentrations (Sandalio et al., 2001). In another study, about 47 % and 41 % in Mn and Zn contents was observed in pea leaves exposed to 50 μM of cadmium in nutrient solution (RodriquezSerrano et al., 2009).\nInterestingly in the present study, the micro-element contents were significantly improved in seeds of plants upon exposure to foliar-applied nano-TiO2. In fact, both nano-TiO2 treatments (100 and 200mg/l) increased Zn, Mn and Co by average of 75.1 %, 28.7 % and 110.1 %, respectively. In contrast to the other micro-elements in the seeds, Cu content was improved in all treatments in comparison to control (Table 3). Exposure of cowpea plants to Cd10+200mg nTiO2/l treatment increased Cu content in seeds significantly (p < 0.05) by ∼480.6 % while both sole Cd and Cd10+100mg nTiO2/l treatments increased Cu contents statistically the same (p > 0.05) by an average of 223.2 %. Crop plants such as cowpea, mostly rely on soil mineral contents for growth, structural and catalytic functions (Purves et al., 1992), and the uptake via active transport could be distorted by Cd-imposed toxicity. In this study, it is proposed that the foliar application of nano-TiO2 portends protection to chloroplast sheath assembly from Cd-induced ROS (Gao et al., 2013) after foliar absorption. This consequently enhanced photosynthetic activities (judging by the increased chlorophyll contents) through photophosphorylation (Zheng et al., 2005, Gao et al.,2013); improved interaction with Fe in electron transport chain (Cigler et al., 2010) and stimulation of enzymatic and photosynthetic activities (Kleiber and Markiewicz, 2013; Markiewicz and Kleiber,\nMean values with the same letter along the column are statistically the same at P < 0.05 using DMRT; * value for Kruskal-Wallis H and significance level.\n2014). Improved leaf growth encourages the source-sink relationship of nutrient flow between the leaves and seeds (developed ovules) as minerals are uploaded in the phloem and translocated to ovules during seed development (Dakora and Belane, 2019). This apparently led to amelioration of Cd toxicity and improved the levels of minerals of seeds in the presence nano-TiO2 intervention. Wojcik and Wojcik (2001) have suggested that the primary reason for improved growth of plants after foliar spray of Ti was the higher leaf Fe2+ level, which enhanced chlorophyll synthesis and uptake of Fe, Mn and Zn.\nThe health risk implication of dietary intake of Cd through cowpea seeds and leaves after nano-remediation intervention was calculated for typical Nigerian adult (Table 4). The estimated daily intake (EDI) values of Cd via consumption of cowpea seeds and leaves from control plants by typical Nigerian adults were below the WHO recommended daily intake (RDI) limit of 0.050mg/person/day (WHO, 1996). In addition, the EDI values of Cd via consumption of cowpea seeds and leaves from sole Cd treatment were high and exceeded the RDI limit as expected. Interestingly, intervention with foliar-applied nTiO2 treatments only reduced the EDI values of leaves below the WHO RDI limit by average factor of ∼2.3 whereas EDI values for seeds in both nanoTiO2 treated plants still exceeded WHO RDI limit by ∼3-fold. The tolerable weekly dietary ingestion of trace metal is mainly depended on factors like amount, contamination level in food and consumption duration (Orisakwe et al., 2012). So, continuous dietary intake of Cd via cowpea leaves poses no health hazard in this present study. However, regular consumption of cowpea seeds despite the nano-TiO2 intervention treatments, still presents serious risk to the adult subpopulations. Furthermore, increased intake of Cd via seed consumption may increase the probability of developing health problems such as hypertension, arthritis and cardiovascular disease. In fact, the recommended Cd level in grains and seeds is< 0.2mg Cd/kg dry weight (FAO, 2014), and this threshold was in several folds lower than obtained Cd contents in seeds after nano-TiO2 intervention. Hazard quotient (HQ) values indicated that despite nano-TiO2 intervention, there was still health risk from Cd through the consumption of seeds as HQs were still above 1.0 (threshold of no risk). Cd is a non-beneficial element that is very toxic and has a protracted biological half-life in human (Fu et al., 2008). However, continued consumption of cowpea leaves as nutritious diet for the subpopulation in this study poses no potential health risk (HQs < 1.0)."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusion",
      "text" : "The study showed that foliar application of nano-TiO2 as nanoremediation strategy reduced Cd uptake and its transport in cowpea plant under moderate Cd stress. The chlorophyll contents (Chl-b and TChl.) of cowpea leaves were considerably improved after nano-TiO2 intervention in the stressed-cowpea plants. Likewise, nano-TiO2 intervention promoted enzymes activity (CAT and SOD) responsible for eliminating ROS and furthermore, reduced MDA contents of root and leaf tissues after intervention. Furthermore, seed micro elements (Zn, Mn and Co) in the Cd-stressed plants were generally enhanced by the foliar nano-TiO2 intervention. However, the intervention only reduced health due to dietary intake of Cd in the leaves while seeds still posed dietary risk to consumers. The protective effects of foliar nano-TiO2 on the Cd-stressed plants could be explained by the decreased uptake/ transport of Cd as well as the nano-TiO2-induced stress responses which increased the plant’s tolerance to Cd toxicity. Conclusively, the proposed foliar nTiO2 application intervention could serve as an effective green option to reduce Cd accumulation and toxicity in cowpea plants. However, studies in real field conditions are suggested to validate the results, and also to re-evaluate the potential health risk due to dietary seed intake of the plants after intervention."

Cowpea plants were exposed to Cd toxicity at 10mg/kg soil for 21 days and afterwards, subjected to six episodes of foliar application of nano-TiO2 intervention. Results showed that foliar-applied nano-TiO2 significantly promoted chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll contents after Cd stress as compared to Cd-stressed plants without the intervention. Interestingly, Cd contents of roots, shoots and grains were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) after nano-TiO2 sprays compared to Cd-stressed plants. However, the Cd contents in edible tissues (leaves and seeds) after interventions remained above recommended threshold. Furthermore, nano-TiO2 interventions promoted stress enzymes activity in both roots and leaves as well as increased Zn, Mn and Co levels in seeds compared to Cd-stressed plants without intervention. Estimated daily intake of Cd in leaves and seeds for adult subpopulation exceeded the WHO recommended daily intake by some folds in Cd-stressed and nano-TiO2treated plants. The health risk quotient (HQ) for adult subpopulation exceeded unitary in seeds from nano-TiO2 treatments (HQ=1.75 and 1.96, respectively) while no potential risk was obtained for leaves. Overall, foliar application of nano-TiO2 portends significant ameliorative potential for Cd toxicity in cowpea plants.",
