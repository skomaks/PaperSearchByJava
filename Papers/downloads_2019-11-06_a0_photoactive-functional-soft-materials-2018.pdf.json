For example, photoisomerization of the retina enables our vision so that we can see and appreciate the vivid natural environment that surrounds us. Similarly, the photoisomerization of phytochromes in plants regulates some critical physiological processes leading to heliotropic and phototropic motions. The movement of the sunflower toward sunlight is a convincing example. As always, such natural phenomena have tremendously inspired scientists and engineers to develop functional photoactive materials and systems for fundamental scientific studies as well as for technological applications. Among various photoactive materials, photoactive soft materials based on biomaterials, polymers, liquid crystals, gels, colloids, etc. that can be driven by light stimulus have recently emerged as advanced functional materials that facilitate a plethora of applications in multiple realms of science and technology. These enabling materials exploit the gamut of distinguished characteristics of light such as convenience of application, noninvasive nature, and fast and orthogonal energy delivery in addition to precise temporal and spatial resolution with remote and digital controllability. Through irradiation by light of tunable wavelength, intensity, and polarization, the existing properties of photoactive soft materials can be readily modulated and/or new properties can be prescribed and, when necessary, certain attributes can be silenced so that the materials can exhibit desired functions suitable for specific applications. Moreover, the functionalities of photoactive soft materials can be wirelessly programmed and their assembly and disassembly into hierarchical structures can be facilely controlled to yield reconfigurable materials and systems. The alignment and reorientation of photoactive soft materials can be driven by light thereby enhancing their properties and performances for switchable applications. In photoactive soft materials, light‐driven molecular events have been cooperatively translated leading to dynamic and controllable macroscopic photophysical and photochemical changes that have been harnessed for the purpose of enabling different applications. In this book, the design, synthesis, properties, and applications of functional photoactive soft materials are covered. Topics dealing with distinct aspects of polymers, biomaterials, liquid crystals, gels, colloids, etc. have been included in this work. Authoritative accounts from an international team of active and leading experts describing the various functional aspects of photoactive soft materials have been\nPreface\nPrefacexii\ncombined in a unified manner in this book. The primary focus of this book is on the design and fabrication of photoactive functional soft materials for application in materials science, nanophotonics, nanotechnology, optomechanics, soft robotics, biological and biomedical applications, switchable surfaces and interfaces, microfluidics, etc. The assessment of different properties of photoactive materials and their performance in devices have been highlighted and the major challenges as well as future prospects are outlined in the chapters.\nThis book is not an attempt to exhaustively cover all the interesting and relevant topics on photoactive functional soft materials since it is simply not possible to do so in a concise manner and within a single volume book. Instead, the book focuses on the recent developments of the most fascinating themes about photoactive functional soft materials: preparation, properties, and applications. The various chapters covering trendy topics are as follows: Soft Materials Driven by Photothermal Effect and Their Applications (Chapter 1), Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers (Chapter  2), Light‐Driven Self‐ Organized Liquid Crystalline Nanostructures Enabled by Chiral Molecular Switches or Motors: From 1D to 3D Photonic Crystals (Chapter  3), Photochemical Chirality Induction and Inversion in Soft Materials (Chapter 4), Soft Photoactuators in Microfluidics (Chapter  5), Liquid Crystal Polymer Networks and Elastomers for Light‐Fueled Robotics (Chapter 6), Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals and Their Applications (Chapter  7), Photomechanical Soft Nanocomposites: Synergies between Soft Matrix and  Energy Conversion Additives (Chapter  8), Photoresponsive Polyolefins (Chapter 9), A Photoresponsive Multi-Bilayered Film for a Tunable Photonic Crystal (Chapter  10), Photoinduced Liquid Crystal Domain Engineering for Optical Field Control (Chapter  11), Azobenzene Polymers as Photoactive Materials for Shape Changes of Micro/Nano‐objects (Chapter  12), Light‐ Controlled Encapsulation and Release Enabled by Photo responsive Polymer Self‐ Assemblies (Chapter  13), and Photoresponsive Soft Materials Based on Reversible Proton Transfer (Chapter 14). In each chapter, the state of the art, along with future prospects in the respective fields, is discussed and highlighted by the experts. The overarching goal of this book has been to reflect on the significant recent developments and current approaches toward the realization of functional photoactive soft materials.\nThe book has been organized with the hope that it would be accessible to undergraduates and graduate students and would be a ready guide for researchers and engineers both in academia and industry. The comprehensive account of the topics covered in various chapters is expected to offer useful information, and provide insight into the exciting concepts and enabling techniques for both early career and experienced researchers in the fields of materials science, materials engineering, polymer science, liquid crystals, chirality induction, colloid and interface science, microfluidics, biological and biomedical science, chemical engineering, organic chemistry, photonics, optoelectronics, optomechanics, soft robotics, imaging and sensing, nanotechnology, and energy efficient materials. Moreover, it is anticipated that the book would stimulate new ideas and\nPreface xiii\ninterest which could drive future developments and forward march of this emerging endeavor.\nI would like to express my gratitude to Martin Preuss at Wiley‐VCH for inviting us to bring this exciting and enabling field of research to a wide audience, and to all our distinguished contributors for their dedicated efforts.

      "heading" : "1.1 Introduction",
      "text" : "We are surrounded by soft materials. Most organs of the human body are made of soft materials. One defining characteristic of soft materials is that they can be readily deformed by external stimuli and stress. Even the thermal energy availa ble at room temperature is sufficient to cause significant deformation in soft materials [1–13]. de Gennes in his 1991 Nobel lecture emphasized “flexibility” as a defining characteristic of soft materials. Colloids, polymers, liquid crystals (LCs), gels, and biological materials are categorized as soft materials. Being per vasive in nature, soft materials have been a source of inspiration for scientists and engineers for the design and fabrication of stimuli‐responsive smart materials and systems for scientific investigations to understand the basic principles and technological application in devices and health care. Accordingly, a wide variety of engineered soft materials have been developed, which play a crucial role in modern technology. Soft nanotechnology, soft robotics, and soft lithography are examples that reflect the far‐reaching implications of soft materials in biology and engineering [14–22]. Soft materials constitute one of the most stimulating interdisciplinary frontiers of modern science and are built on diverse experimen tal and theoretical foundations. Although soft materials in neat state have found a wide range of applications, fabrication of composites of soft materials by inte grating other functional materials has recently become a common practice to realize advanced and tunable materials with enhanced properties for high‐tech applications. Incorporation of photothermal agents into the matrices of soft materials is one such emerging approach. Photothermal agents absorb light and convert it into heat, which is referred to as the photothermal effect. Over the past decade, many different types of photo thermal agents have been reported, including inorganic nanomaterials (e.g. noble metal nanoparticles and carbon‐based materials) (Figure 1.1) and organic Soft Materials Driven by Photothermal Effect and Their Applications Hari K. Bisoyi1, Augustine M. Urbas2, and Quan Li1 1 Kent State University, Liquid Crystal Institute and Chemical Physics Interdisciplinary Program, 1425 Lefton Esplanade, Kent, OH 44242, USA 2 Wright‐Patterson Air Force Base, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory, Dayton, OH 45433, USA\ncompounds or materials (e.g. indocyanine green and polyaniline) [23–54]. Different classes of photothermal agents are associated with their own advan tages and disadvantages. Near infrared (NIR)‐absorbing photothermal agents have earned a special position owing to their suitability in biological applications since biological tissues are largely transparent to NIR light. They have been applied in photothermal therapy and drug delivery remotely actuated by NIR light. Local heat produced by these agents raises the temperature and causes cell death in cancer treatment. Photothermal agents have also been used to trigger and accelerate drug release in biomedical applications. A useful photothermal agent is required to exhibit strong absorption of light and efficient transduction of light into heat. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs), gold nanorods (GNRs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and iron oxide nanoparticles have been employed as photothermal agents owing to their high photothermal conversion efficiency [55–67]. Similarly, conjugated polymers and dye molecules have also been uti lized as photothermal agents. These organic compounds convert absorbed light through a non‐radiative relaxation process. Plasmonic particles such as gold nanoparticles produce heat subsequent to light absorption through a distinct\nmechanism. Light absorbed by GNPs excites the electrons in the plasmonic band. These excited electrons relax through electron–phonon interaction by col liding with the gold lattice. This collision produces heat, which is transferred to the surrounding medium through phonon–phonon coupling, resulting in increasing the surrounding temperature (Figure 1.1e).\nRecently, remote driving of soft materials by combining with photothermal agents is an emerging endeavor that reaps the benefits of both classes of promis ing materials. Accordingly, both inorganic and organic photothermal agents have been incorporated into the matrices of soft materials. The functional composite materials have been driven by light where the photothermal agent absorbs the light and converts it into heat, thereby increasing the temperature. The remotely triggered local temperature increase causes various physical and morphological changes including phase transitions. The occurrence of such changes in the soft matter matrix has been exploited for different applications (Figure 1.2). In this chapter, we present the developments on soft materials driven by photothermal effect of various photothermal agents. The combination of well‐known soft materials such as LCs, polymers, and gels with inorganic nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials, and organic dyes is discussed."

      "heading" : "1.2 Liquid Crystals Driven by Photothermal Effect",
      "text" : "Liquid crystals (LCs) represent a state of matter that appears between the crys talline solid state and isotropic liquid state [68–75]. This thermodynamically stable state of matter has been recognized as the fourth state of matter after solid, liquid, and gas. In this state of matter, the constituent elements, i.e. molecules, macromolecules, and molecular aggregates, simultaneously exhibit order and mobility, which renders it very intriguing and fascinating. The presence of order makes this state anisotropic whereas molecular mobility facilitates stimuli responsiveness. LCs are commonly known for their extensive applications in liq uid crystal display (LCD) devices. However, they have been applied in numerous non‐display applications [76–86]. In addition to their technological applications,\n1 Soft Materials Driven by Photothermal Effect and Their Applications4\nLCs are interesting for fundamental studies to understand self‐assembly and self‐ organization of matter in multiple dimensions and over different length scales [87–97]. LCs serve as model supramolecular systems. They have been regarded as an important class of soft materials owing to their large response to small stimuli [98–108]. Moreover, they play very critical roles in living systems. LCs offer a significant contribution in nanoscience and nanotechnology. LCs have been classified into two broad classes: thermotropic and lyotropic. In thermotro pic materials, the occurrence of LC phases is dependent on temperature. In lyo tropic systems, the LC phase formation is primarily determined by the concentration of solutes in appropriate solvents although temperature also plays a role in the appearance and stability of LC phases.\nThermotropic and lyotropic LC phases undergo phase transition in response to the effect of temperature change. The temperature of the systems can be changed by directly heating or cooling in contact with heat sources. However, temperature variation by remote control and noncontact methods is appealing in many instances where application of direct heat is either detrimental or imprac tical. In this context, the use of light energy to vary the temperature of thermo tropic and lyotropic LCs is very promising. In order to achieve this goal, it is often necessary to have a component in the system that can absorb the light energy and efficiently convert it into heat, thereby increasing the temperature of the medium. This role of converting light energy into heat has been played by certain metal nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials, and organic compounds that exhibit photothermal effect. Thus, LC materials can be effectively driven by light using such photothermal agents in their matrices. The temperature variation by photothermal effect can either cause phase transitions or modification of physi cal properties of LC phases. Therefore, a variety of photothermal agents includ ing inorganic nanoparticles and organic compounds have been employed for driving LC materials for fundamental studies and different applications.\nSun et al. have prepared gold‐nanocrystal‐doped LC elastomer microparticles and studied their light‐driven shape morphing [109]. Soft lithography and polymerization techniques were used to fabricate microcylinders from the LC elastomer nanocomposite. The processing conditions were such that weakly undulating director orientation along the long axis of the microcylinders was obtained. Upon irradiation with infrared (IR) laser, the dispersed GNPs effi ciently produce heat and transfer it to the surrounding in the matrices. This local heat produced upon exposure to IR light is able to modulate the ordering in the liquid crystalline microparticles. Both reversible and irreversible changes in the shape of the microcylinders have been observed using scanned beams (Figure 1.3).\nFong et al. doped GNRs into a lyotropic LC matrix [110, 111]. Through NIR laser irradiation, they could achieve control over the nanostructure of the meso phase (Figure 1.4). Since lyotropic mesophases are used for drug and gene deliv ery applications, control over their nanostructures could facilitate on‐demand delivery of encapsulated agents. Integration of GNRs and driving phase transi tions by photothermal effect in lyotropic mesophases are promising way to con trol the nanostructure of the mesophases. Accordingly, GNRs were dispersed into the lyotropic mesophase matrix and the reversible changes in their nano structures under NIR laser irradiation were investigated by different techniques.\nMoreover, the effects of lipid composition, aspect ratio, and concentration of GNRs as well as laser pulse duration on the response of the systems were studied.\nFong et al. further undertook studies to understand the role of photothermal effect in non‐lamellar LC systems [112]. They set out to reveal the photothermal response of known and new lamellar and non‐lamellar lyotropic phases by cor relating the thermal properties of the materials and the photothermal energy conversion by the photothermal agent. Photothermal heating was carried out by irradiating the composite systems with NIR laser and the consequent structural\nchanges of the LC phases were monitored by X‐ray scattering studies. The effect of GNRs on the hexagonal phase was studied by electron microscopy techniques. Detailed understanding of such lyotropic nanocomposites is critical for their use in drug delivery applications remotely triggered by photothermal effect.\nPezzi et al. studied the photothermal effect of GNPs in thermotropic nematic liquid crystal (NLC) phases both experimentally and theoretically [113]. They characterized the photothermal effect of GNPs doped into thermotropic LCs and subsequently modeled the observations. Theoretical modeling of the pho toinduced temperature variation in the LC nanocomposites was performed using the thermal heating equation that is applicable to an anisotropic medium such as the host nematic phase. Predictions of the theory were verified by con ducting photothermal experiments on an LC nanocomposite fabricated by dis persing GNPs into a nematic host. Thermographic comparison between the nanocomposite and pure host clearly shows that GNPs are responsible for the observed photothermal effect under resonant optical frequency (Figure  1.5). This comprehensive investigation contributes toward the understanding of the physical phenomenon of heat propagation at the nanoscale.\nLiu et al. observed rapid and reversible actuation of LC elastomer micropillars containing GNPs [114]. In this study, a new experimental protocol has been\ndeveloped to facilely disperse GNPs and GNRs into the polyacrylate‐based LC elastomer. Micropillars and microactuators containing GNPs and GNRs were fabricated from the plasmonic polymer nanocomposites. The effect of the incor porated GNPs was investigated by a battery of characterization methods includ ing microscopy, spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and scattering experiments. Photothermal actuation behavior of the composites and the pure elastomer host were studied and compared. It was found that GNR is a good candidate for the development of LC elastomer‐based high‐performance photothermal actuators. Yang et al. prepared GNR‐containing LC elastomer composites using thiol‐click chemistry [115]. These elastomeric composites exhibited responsiveness to NIR and underwent nematic to isotropic phase transition under NIR irradiation.\nWe designed and synthesized mesogen‐functionalized plasmonic GNRs and dispersed them into thermotropic NLC hosts [116]. Mesogen functionalization of the nanorods enhanced their compatibility in the LC matrix and enabled their homogeneous dispersion. Upon irradiation with NIR laser, the LC nanocomposite exhibited nematic to isotropic phase transition (Figure 1.6). However, when the light source was turned off the mixture returned back to the nematic phase. Thus, reversible phase transition was observed in the nanocomposites. It was noticed\nthat composites containing higher concentration of mesogen‐functionalized GNRs underwent faster phase transitions.\nPezzi et al. found that GNPs embedded in NLCs exhibit a photothermal effect that is dependent on the refractive index of the medium [117]. They imple mented a theoretical model to account for the observed photoinduced tempera ture variations in GNPs dispersed in NLCs. Experimental results of GNP LC composites have been compared with the theoretical predictions. de Sio et al. have studied plasmonic heating of GNRs in chiral LCs [118]. It was found that the presence of GNRs desensitizes the shift of the cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) reflection band to temperature. Suitable cell design enables one to “turn off” the wavelength shift of the peak reflection, thereby turning the system into a pure amplitude measurement tool.\nWe have achieved handedness inversion in a GNR containing a CLC phase driven by NIR light irradiation [119]. Mesogen‐functionalized GNRs were dis persed into the CLC phase formed by a chiral mesomorphic compound. Upon NIR irradiation, the sample temperature increases due to the photothermal effect of GNRs, which brings about pitch changes in the cholesteric system and\n1.2 Liquid Crystals Driven by Photothermal Effect 9\nthus a change in the selective reflection. Interestingly, the cholesteric system exhibits handedness inversion upon increasing the temperature (Figure  1.7). Red, green, and blue reflection colors were obtained both in the right‐ and left‐ handed states of the CLC. This NIR‐light‐driven plasmonic system would be\n1 Soft Materials Driven by Photothermal Effect and Their Applications10\npromising in applications where both left‐ and right‐handed circularly polarized light with tunable wavelengths are required.\nWe have also utilized the photothermal effect of GNRs to study phase transi tions in LC blue phase composites [120]. Mesogen‐functionalized GNRs were designed, synthesized, and dispersed into the cubic matrix of a blue phase. Upon irradiation with NIR light, the composite exhibited phase transition from a body‐ centered cubic lattice to a simple cubic lattice before turning into the isotropic phase. The NIR‐light‐driven phase transition has been found to be reversible (Figure 1.8). Interestingly, the lattice constant of the blue phase could be tuned by NIR light irradiation, which has produced red, green, and blue reflection colors from these photonic nanostructures.\nPalermo et  al. have demonstrated optical control of the plasmonic heating effect in NLCs employing the photoalignment technique [121, 122]. Here, they have exploited the dependence of the refractive index of NLCs on the molecular orientation. By varying the molecular alignment of the NLCs, control over the rate of plasmonic heating by the GNPs has been achieved.\nYang et al. have reported IR‐light‐driven reversible actuation in LC elastomer nanocomposites containing CNTs [123]. They used poly(p‐phenyleneethy nylene)‐functionalized single‐walled CNTs as fillers in the LC elastomer matrix. Such functionalization was found to enhance the dispersibility of CNTs in the elastomer matrix. The NIR response of the composite was found to increase upon high loading of CNTs in the composites. Ji et al. have developed a protocol for the dispersion and alignment of CNTs in LC polymers and elastomers [124].\n1.2 Liquid Crystals Driven by Photothermal Effect 11\nThey have taken advantage of the photothermal property of the embedded CNTs to achieve remote‐controlled actuation of the elastomeric nanocomposites. Li et al. demonstrated actuation of LC elastomer nanocomposites containing CNTs driven by IR as well as white light [125]. Similar observations have been reported by Marshall et al. [126]. Direct sunlight has also been employed to drive LC elas tomer nanocomposites containing CNTs [127].\nKohlmeyer and Chen fabricated and demonstrated wavelength‐selective IR‐ light‐driven hinges based on LC elastomers [128]. Composites of the elastomers were prepared by dispersing either CNTs or NIR dyes. The elastomeric nano composites exhibit fast and reversible bending upon NIR light irradiation. Bilayers films and inchworm walkers have been realized using these nanocom posites (Figure 1.9).\nLi et al. reported bulk nanocomposites from LC elastomers and single‐walled CNTs [129]. Light‐driven bulk actuation in the composites was demonstrated under uniform as well as asymmetric irradiation. Wang et al. have synthesized polysiloxane‐based LC elastomers containing azobenzene moieties [130]. Nanocomposites prepared from these elastomers can be driven either by NIR or by UV irradiation. NIR laser irradiation was found to cause shrinkage of the nanocomposite films.\nYu et  al. fabricated polymer‐dispersed LC–graphene oxide nanocomposites and prepared thin films using the solution casting method and mechanical stretching [131]. In the composites, graphene‐oxide‐doped poly(vinyl alcohol) acted as the matrix whereas a low molar mass room temperature NLC formed\n1 Soft Materials Driven by Photothermal Effect and Their Applications12\na separated phase. The nanocomposite films exhibited photomechanical response upon irradiation with visible light (Figure 1.10a–c). The origin of this response has been attributed to arise from the photothermal effect of graphene oxide.\nYu et al. further demonstrated light‐driven tumbler movement in polymer gra phene oxide nanocomposite films [132]. Reversible and stable photomechanical behavior was obtained in these nanocomposites due to the combination of shape memory effect of the polymer host and photothermal effect of the graphene oxide guest. Control over such complicated motion could lead to devices with improved performances.\nQuinn et al. have dispersed graphene nanoparticles into lyotropic LC phases [133, 134]. They observed that upon NIR light irradiation, the lyotropic system undergoes phase transition from cubic to micellar through hexagonal phase (Figure 1.10d). The cubic phase recovers when the NIR source is removed. The occurrence of reversible phase transition has been attributed to the local heating of the matrix through photothermal effect of the embedded graphene particles.\n1.2 Liquid Crystals Driven by Photothermal Effect 13\nSuch hybrid systems could be employed for in vivo payload release by stimula tion with NIR irradiation.\nYang et al. have prepared LC elastomer nanocomposites containing graphene nanosheets by in situ photopolymerization [135]. Photopolymerization and hot‐ drawing of the composites have yielded composites with highly aligned graphene in their matrix. They have investigated the photomechanical actuation in nano composite films driven by NIR irradiation (Figure 1.11).\nLi et  al. have observed substantial light‐induced uniaxial contraction in LC elastomer nanocomposites containing graphene oxide nanoparticles [136]. Moreover, photoactuation of the nanocomposites has been observed under both UV and IR light irradiation.\nWang et al. have synthesized mesogen‐functionalized graphene, which facili tates homogeneous dispersion and high compatibility in a chiral LC matrix [137]. Utilizing the stable LC nanocomposites, an adaptive window system has been demonstrated that responds to multiple stimuli (Figure 1.12). The optical trans parency of the device could be modulated between transparent and opaque states by IR light irradiation by exploiting the photothermal effect of graphene sheets incorporated into the system. Here, light‐induced heating of the film causes phase transition in the chiral LC, leading to transparency modulation. The chiral nanocomposites hold huge potential toward the fabrication of adaptive and energy‐efficient windows for automotive and architectural applications.\nVallooran et  al. have introduced magnetic nanoparticles into the matrix of lyotropic LCs and investigated the photothermal effect of the nanoparticles on the phase behavior of the system [138]. The magnetic nanoparticles greatly facil itate the alignment of the LC phase under magnetic field. Upon photoirradition, the system was observed to undergo LC to isotropic phase transition owing to the photothermal effect exhibited by the iron oxide nanoparticles. It was found  that the effect of the photothermal effect could be tuned by adjusting\nthe  concentration of the nanoparticles in the matrix. Moreover, the orienta tional order can also be modulated by changing the concentration of the parti cles. This hybrid mesophase system is responsive to both magnetic field and photoirradiation.\nOno and Kawatsuki have studied the photothermal response characteristics of host–guest LC systems [139]. The results showed the photoresponsive proper ties to be dependent on the change in refractive index of the system due to tem perature variation caused by laser light absorption. It was noticed that refractive index change was proportional to laser beam intensity. The photothermal response of the system was reversible. They have further investigated photother mal effect in NLCs on a dye‐doped polymer film [140]. The NLC molecules were found to undergo reorientation due to rise in temperature at the interface between the NLC layer and the polymer surface.\nGuo et al. have fabricated and investigated NIR‐absorbing elastomer compos ites containing mesogenic croconaine dye [141]. They designed and synthesized the first example of an NIR‐absorbing liquid crystalline croconaine‐based dye.\n1.2 Liquid Crystals Driven by Photothermal Effect 15\nThe LC nature of the NIR dye makes it more compatible in the elastomer matrix. Moreover, homogeneous distribution of the dispersed dye could be achieved in the soft polymer matrix. A monodomain LC elastomer composite was obtained by adopting the traditional LC alignment method in combination with photopo lymerization of monomer mixtures. Films fabricated from the elastomer com posite were able to show a fully reversible contraction and expansion cycle in response to NIR light irradiation. Liu et al. have dispersed polyaniline‐conduct ing polymer nanoparticles into the matrix of LC elastomers and investigated their NIR response through photothermal effect [142]. The effect of doping con centration and the conjugation form of the polyaniline nanoparticles on the pho tomechanical response of the elastomer composite was studied. The elastomeric composite material was found to exhibit fully reversible muscle‐like actuation and could lift up heavier weights under NIR irradiation owing to the photother mal effect of the polyaniline nanoparticles.\nGelebart et al. have reported on self‐sustained mechanical oscillators that are produced by embedding NIR‐absorbing dyes into LC networks [143]. They developed splay‐aligned LC networks using commercially available LC mono mers. To obtain self‐sustained oscillation in the system by light irradiation they have added photostabilizers into the polymer network matrix that convert absorbed light into heat through non‐radiative relaxation. The observation of mechanical self‐oscillation has been linked to temperature variation over the film thickness. The oscillation of a beam‐shaped device (Figure 1.13) is activated in a localized responsive zone that acts as a hinge. It was found that light span ning across UV to the NIR region could be employed for actuation.\nLiu et al. synthesized NIR chromophore‐functionalized LC elastomers that are capable of exhibiting fast response speed and promising mechanical property [144]. A croconaine dye‐based cross‐linker was used as the NIR‐absorbing motif. They prepared uniaxially aligned main‐chain LC elastomers using a two‐step diene metathesis in situ polymerization and cross‐linking. Under NIR irradia tion, the elastomer system raises its temperature from 18 to 260 °C by efficient photothermal conversion due to the presence of homogeneously distributed and covalently linked NIR chromophore. The soft actuator fabricated from these NIR‐absorbing elastomers was able to lift loads 5600 times heavier than its own weight.\nLi et al. have doped polydopamine nanoparticles into the matrices of LC elas tomers. The photothermal effect of polydopamine has been exploited in the systems for developing dynamic three‐dimensional (3D) structures by light‐ irradiation‐induced deformations [145]. The dispersion of polydopamine in the elastomer matrices turned out to be more facile than the dispersion of CNTs. The mechanical properties of the polydopamine‐dispersed elastomers have been found to be superior to those of the pure host materials. Tian et al. have reported the fabrication and light‐driven actuation of polydopamine‐coated LC elastomers [146]. These coated systems exhibit rapid response and significant contraction because of the photothermal effect of polydopamine cladding. Interestingly, by surface scanning with NIR laser the polydopamine‐coated elas tomer films could be made to bend or roll up. A prototype robotic swimmer was designed and demonstrated using the elastomer films, which was able to swim\non the water surface in response to NIR laser irradiation. The above‐described research shows that polymer‐based photothermal agents could be employed in the fabrication of optically driven artificial muscle for application in soft robot ics and functional optomechanical devices."

      "text" : "Biopolymers such as polysaccharides, polypeptides, and polynucleotides have played a vital role in the evolution and advance of life. Their criticality in life process is well appreciated by scientists and nonscientists alike. Synthetic poly mers such as teflon, nylon, and polyesters have revolutionalized the way we use materials and have significantly influenced our modern life, starting from the comfortable clothes we wear to the luxury cars we drive. Very recently, supramo lecular polymer materials have been developed by appropriate engineering of different noncovalent interactions. These dynamic and functional materials dis play a variety of promising properties and enable many applications that are either difficult or impossible to achieve by conventional polymer materials.\n1.3 Polymers Driven by Photothermal Effect 17\nWhile polymers themselves are interesting, recently it has been recognized that their composites often exhibit remarkably superior traits and perform better in certain applications. Accordingly, many varieties of polymer composites have been developed and explored, and in the recent years polymer nanocomposites containing CNTs, graphene, and graphene derivatives have been paid special attention [147–152]. It has been noticed that carbon‐based nanomaterials often enhance the optical, electrical, and mechanical properties of polymer nanocom posites and introduce new capabilities into the hybrid polymer systems.\nCNTs, which absorb light and convert it into heat, have been dispersed into the matrices of various polymers to realize functional polymer nanocomposites. The polymer matrices can be driven by the photoinduced temperature increase [153]. CNTs have been used in thermoplastic elastomer matrices for efficient shape recovery by utilizing the photothermal effect of CNTs that facilitates local heat ing in the system upon light irradiation. Ahir et al. investigated IR‐light‐induced actuation in aligned polymer–nanotube composites [154, 155]. The polymer– CNT composites have been found to either expand or contract depending on the processing of the hybrid system. Rubber composites with multi‐walled CNTs have been prepared and their reversible photomechanical actuation response has been investigated under NIR light irradiation. CNTs were aligned in the rub ber matrix by applying stress to the composites. The degree of alignment of the nanotubes was found to influence the photomechanical response of the compos ites. These composites contract along the alignment direction of the nanotubes. Different polymer hosts were evaluated to gain greater insight into the photome chanical actuation triggered by NIR light.\nLu and Panchapakesan investigated the photomechanical responses of CNT/ polymer actuators [156]. They compared the photomechanical response of bulk polymer nanocomposites and multilayer constructions containing single‐walled CNTs and multi‐walled CNTs. The photomechanical actuation behavior of the composites containing single‐walled CNT and multi‐walled CNT was related to nanotube alignment in the matrix and the presence of pre‐strain. Comparable actuation properties were observed between multilayered constructions and bulk composites. Expansion and contractions were observed under small and large pre‐strains respectively. Miyako et al. fabricated and studied CNT–polymer composites for light‐driven microthermal control [157]. Here, polydimethylsi loxane (PDMS) was chosen as the soft polymer and noncovalently surface‐func tionalized CNTs were dispersed into its matrix. Noncovalent functionalization of CNTs is often preferred since this procedure does not significantly compro mise the intrinsic electronic property of the nanotubes. A phospholipid and a protein were used for the surface modification of the nanotubes. A microchip was fabricated from the polymer nanocomposite and temperature distribution in a microchannel was investigated under NIR irradiation. Temperature control of an aqueous solution in the microchannel has been achieved, which makes this hybrid system suitable for various lab‐on‐a‐chip applications.\nCzanikova et al. developed photoactuating materials based on elastomers and modified CNTs [158]. The matrix of ethylene–vinylacetate was integrated with multi‐walled CNTs. The nanotubes were surface functionalized with a pyrene cholesterol conjugate by the noncovalent approach to enhance its compatibility\n1 Soft Materials Driven by Photothermal Effect and Their Applications18\nand dispersibility in the elastomer matrix. Nanotubes were uniaxially aligned in the composite by shearing forces. The photoactuation behavior of the soft and  responsive nanocomposites was investigated by atomic force microscopy and nanoindentation techniques. Czanikova et  al. have also reported single‐ walled CNT‐based photoactuators in ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer [159]. Photoactuation and relaxation behaviors of the nanocomposites with aligned nanotubes were studied with respect to CNT concentration, light intensity, etc.\nTang et al. reported CNT‐dispersed poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) composites for solar energy conversion and storage [160]. They prepared a ternary nanocompos ite using multi‐walled CNT, PEG, and silicon dioxide. The composite could absorb sunlight and efficiently convert it into thermal energy and can act as an energy storage system. Given the huge demand for energy conversion and storage devices and systems, this simple ternary nanocomposite containing a photother mal agent and a phase change material is very interesting for fundamental studies and technological applications. Ilcikova et  al. developed acrylic thermoplastic elastomers that were dispersed with block‐copolymer‐grafted CNTs [161]. The nanocomposite of the triblock copolymer containing diblock‐copolymer‐grafted CNTs exhibited photoactuating behavior. Under red light exposure, the elasto meric nanocomposite showed fast and reversible actuation. CNTs and fullerene‐ based hybrid systems have been developed and applied as temperature indicators by taking advantage of the photothermal conversion characteristic of CNTs [162]. CNTs and GNPs have also been employed as photothermal agent in the shape, morphology, and wetting properties of fullerene‐based microparticles [163].\nGraphene, the two‐dimensional (2D) allotrope of carbon, has gained enor mous attention [164]. Impressive electronic, optical, and mechanical properties along with high surface area have rendered graphene an appealing material. Insertion of graphene into polymer matrices has yielded significantly improved physical properties.\nLiang et al. fabricated graphene‐based nanocomposites that could be triggered by IR light and can act as actuators [165]. They dispersed sulfonated functional ized graphene particles into thermoplastic polyurethane to prepare light‐driven nanocomposite actuators. The nanocomposite not only exhibited excellent pho toactuation but also helped in significantly improving the mechanical properties of the hybrid system. Upon irradiation with IR light the nanocomposite under goes contraction and thereby could lift a 21.6 g weight by 3.1 cm with a force of 0.21 N. The mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were found to improve with increase in graphene loading in the system. Comparison of different kinds of graphene materials has revealed that the light‐driven actuation behavior of the nanocomposites depends on the nature of the aromatic network of graphene as well as the homogeneity of its dispersion in the matrix. Loomis et  al. have revealed layer‐dependent mechanical responses of graphene composites to NIR light [166]. They fabricated graphene nanosheet dispersed polymer nanocom posites and prepared thin films from the hybrid system. Nanocomposites con taining single layer graphene and multilayer graphene were made for comparison of their physical response to NIR light irradiation. Both elastic moduli and stress response of the single layer and multilayer graphene containing composites were observed to be different from one another. The difference in behavior of these\n1.3 Polymers Driven by Photothermal Effect 19\ncomposites has been attributed to the number of graphene layers in contact with the host polymer in the matrix. Loomis et al. have developed photothermal nan opositioners from graphene–elastomer nanocomposites [167]. The nanoposi tioners were fabricated from the nanocomposites made by dispersing graphene nanoplatelets into the soft and responsive matrix of PDMS. Upon light irradia tion the grahene nanoplatelets absorb the photons and convert them into heat, thereby increasing the local temperature in the nanocomposite. They developed a two‐axis stage with sub‐micron resolution, which permitted two‐axis position ing (120 nm resolution and about 5 μm s−1 speed) driven by photothermal effect. Good actuation speed and appreciable actuator efficiency were obtained for the nanocomposites. However, there is still room for improvement in the perfor mance of the photothermal nanopositioners.\nAnsari et  al. made optical actuators from graphene and triblock copolymer composites [168]. Freestanding thin films were prepared from the nanocompos ites containing graphene platelets in the matrix of the block copolymer poly(styrene‐b‐isoprene‐b‐styrene). Solvent casting technique was used in the preparation of the freestanding nanocomposite films. It was found that under strained conditions the nanocomposite film contracts upon IR irradiation. However, under stress‐free conditions the films were found to expand. Such films could find application in biomedical field in situations where remote‐controlled actuation is preferred. Meng et al. observed enhanced photothermal effect of gra phene conjugated polymer composites [169]. Poly(3‐hexylthiophene)‐conjugated polymer was covalently grafted onto reduced graphene oxide sheets to prepare the hybrid system. This hybrid system exhibited superior photothermal effect when compared with the system without covalent linking. This enhanced perfor mance has been attributed to photoinduced energy transfer from the conjugated polymer backbone to the reduced graphene oxide surface. Using a thin layer of this hybrid material a photocontrolled electrical switch has been demonstrated.\nMuralidharan et al. prepare nanocomposites from biocompatible natural poly mer chitosan and reduced graphene oxide [170]. Using solvent casting technique they obtained nanocomposite‐based actuators that exhibit photomechanical actuation under IR light illumination. The samples studied underwent contrac tion in length in response to IR exposure. Light‐induced stress and strain were found to increase upon increase in reduced graphene oxide loading in the actua tor matrices. In this system the applied pre‐strain was found to reduce photo mechanical stress of the actuators, which is an unusual behavior. Since photomechanical actuation in the nanocomposite is dependent on the concen tration of graphene oxide and the applied pre‐strain, the actuation behavior could be tuned by varying these two parameters. Leeladhar et al. demonstrated the fabrication of highly versatile photomechanical actuators using graphene platelets dispersed in PDMS matrix [171]. The actuators were prepared in a bilayer actuator where a thin layer of chromium was coated on one side of the polymer nanocomposite film. The bilayer actuators were found to exhibit fast and reversible actuation with a large deflection angle. Moreover, the actuator was found to exhibit photoresponse depending on the wavelength used. The large bending observed has been ascribed to the mismatch of the coefficients of thermal expansion between the two layers.\n1 Soft Materials Driven by Photothermal Effect and Their Applications20\nRobinson et  al. developed biocompatible reduced‐graphene‐oxide‐based hybrid materials that exhibit high absorption in the NIR region [172]. Single‐ layered reduced graphene oxide nanosheets were noncovalently surface func tionalized with amphiphilic PEGylated polymer chains, which are able to show sixfold higher NIR absorption when compared to their nonreduced and cova lently functionalized counterparts. Photoablation of U87MG cancer cells was demonstrated in vitro by employing reduced graphene oxide hybrids bearing a peptide with the Arg–Gly–Asp (RGD) moiety as photothermal agents. The reduced graphene oxide hybrid system, which is biocompatible and exhibits high NIR absorption, could be useful for photothermal therapy of cancer.\nFeng et al. prepared polyurethane‐based efficient actuators by incorporating functionalized reduced graphene oxide and CNTs into the polymer matrix [173]. These polyurethane hybrids containing the nanofillers exhibit good IR light absorption and consequent actuation. By adjusting the doping ratio of reduced graphene oxide and CNT, impressive IR‐actuated stress recovery has been achieved in these multicomponent photothermal systems. Niu et al. have dem onstrated a photomechanical soft actuator that has been fabricated from PDMS doped with graphene nanoplatelets [174]. The soft actuator is made up of a bilayer film: one layer is the graphene‐dispersed PDMS and the other layer is pure PDMS. In this bilayer system, the mismatch between the coefficients of thermal expansion of the layers has been utilized to achieve controllable and reversible bending in response to NIR light irradiation. Different bending behav ior has been registered by selecting the layer for exposure to light source. The occurrence of temperature gradient across the thickness of the layers has been assumed to be responsible for the distinct bending behavior observed.\nOrganic conjugated polymers capable of conducting ions and electrons have been developed and extensively investigated. Their applications in organic elec tronic and optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, field effect transistors, and light‐emitting diodes have been well documented. Apart from these well‐known applications, their suitability in various other areas has been assessed and they have been employed in high‐tech applications such as biomedical science, bio sensing, supercapacitor, chemical sensing, and fluorescence imaging. Owing to their extended conjugation length, many conducting polymers could absorb IR radiation and through nonradiative relaxation can produce heat. This energy transduction property of the conjugated polymers qualifies them as an attractive class of organic photothermal agents. Consequently, they have been used in both in vitro and in vivo photothermal therapy of cancer. These polymers could also be used as highly efficient drug delivery systems with large loading capacity. Thus, they could be useful in combination therapies. Recently conjugated polymers with large absorption coefficient, good photostability, bicompatibility, biodegra dability, and acceptable photothermal conversion efficiencies have been realized and their application potential as photothermal agents has been evaluated.\nYang et al. reported organic nanoparticles based on the conducting polymer polyaniline and used them as photothermal agents in the ablation of cancer cells by light irradiation [175]. Polyaniline can exist in emeraldine base (EB) or emer aldine salt (ES) state. The EB form of polyaniline can be readily converted into the ES state by doping process (Figure  1.14). The doping process shifts the\n1 Soft Materials Driven by Photothermal Effect and Their Applications22\nabsorption of polyaniline into the NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum by decreasing the energy bandgap. Polyaniline is found to be capable of convert ing the absorbed NIR light into heat and is biocompatible. Therefore, it has been used as an organic photothermal agent in photothermal therapy of cancer. Water soluble and stable polyaniline nanoparticles have been prepared by nanoemul sion method and have been applied in the treatment of epithelial cancer cells using NIR light. Similar surface‐coated polyaniline nanoparticles have also been used for both in vitro and in vivo photothermal therapy of cancer [176]. The sur face‐functionalized uniform polyaniline nanoparticles were found to possess high extinction coefficient and exhibit higher photothermal conversion effi ciency. Low toxicity of these photothermal nanoparticles to living cells has been ascertained using a variety of analytical characterization techniques.\nGeng et al. designed and synthesized biocompatible conjugated polymer nano particles for efficient photothermal tumor therapy [177]. They have judiciously engineered the polymer backbone through the coupling of donor and acceptor moieties. Polymer nanoparticles were fabricated using a suitable precipitation method in an encapsulation matrix. Both in vitro and in vivo cancer cell killing by NIR light irradiation has been demonstrated using these polymer nanoparticles with large absorption coefficient. Such carefully designed polymers could find use in photothermal cancer therapy.\nLyu et al. developed and used the photothermal effect of semiconducting poly mer bioconjugates for activation of targeted neurons [178]. The semiconducting bioconjugates have been found to possess higher photothermal conversion effi ciency than GNRs. They have demonstrated NIR‐light‐driven control of ther mosensitive ion channels in neurons using the polymer bioconjugates. Owing to the fast energy conversion ability to heat and high spatial precision to the ion channel, safe and reversible activation of the intracellular calcium ion influx of neuronal cells has been accomplished using the polymer bioconjugates. This method is benign in that it does not involve genetic transfection. This organic nanoparticle‐based photothermal technique is powerful and could be a potential alternative to optogenetics. Lyu et al. have demonstrated in vivo photothermal therapy using semiconducting polymer nanoparticles [179]. They carried out intraparticle molecular orbital manipulation to enhance the photothermal effi ciency of the polymer nanoparticles for cancer therapy. For this purpose, they have used fullerene particles in combination with semiconducting polymers. The energy levels of the donor polymer and acceptor fullerene derivative have been so aligned that photoinduced electron transfer occurs efficiently and quenches the fluorescence in the system. This leads to nonradiative relaxation following light irradiation and thus produces heat. This approach to photothermal therapy could be extended to other binary composite systems. Cao et al. designed and synthesized an organic conjugated polymer and found that it possessed high effi ciency in photothermal conversion [180]. The conjugated polymer prepared contains donor and acceptor entities in its structure and has a very narrow band gap. The narrow bandgap enables the polymer to absorb NIR light. This photo stable polymer with high extinction coefficient exhibits high photothermal conversion. The photothermal effect of the polymer has been used to drive temperature‐dependent devices. The conjugated polymer could be applicable in\n1.4 Gels Driven by Photothermal Effect 23\nbiomedical technology due to its high absorbance in the biocompatible NIR window."

      "heading" : "1.4 Gels Driven by Photothermal Effect",
      "text" : "Gels are a promising class of soft materials. They have been extensively investi gated in materials science and bioscience owing to their outstanding character istics and a variety of potential and practical applications [181–185]. Gels do not flow and exhibit solid‐like rheology. Stimuli responsiveness, adaptability, and self‐healing of morphological defects are some of their excellent attributes. Gels contain a large volume of liquid (water or organic solvent), which is immobilized by a network of gelators. The gelators could be small molecules with low molecu lar weight or macromolecules with high molar mass. Hydrogels are made up of water as the solvent whereas organogels contain organic solvents. Gels can vary in the nature of network formation by the gelators. The gelators can form chemi cally cross‐linked networks via covalent bonding or exhibit physically cross‐ linked networks through noncovalent supramolecular interactions. Different properties are observed in different types of gels. It should be noted that gels can also be fabricated from LC phases using suitable gelators. Unlike in hydrogels and organogels, the solvent in LC gels is an anisotropic fluid medium. Advanced nanocomposites have been developed by dispersing nanoscale particles into the matrix of gels. Nanocomposites of gels could exhibit superior properties than the pure host gels due to the synergy between complementary strengths of the two functional components in one system. Recently, distinct nanocomposite gels containing different photothermal agents have been attracting considerable amount of attention. Application prospects of such nanocomposites have been demonstrated in materials science, biomedical science, optomechanics, micro fluidics, drug delivery, etc. Moreover, the gel nanocomposites are interesting hybrid systems to understand how collective properties arise from interaction between the components within the soft stimuli‐responsive matrices.\nMebrouk et  al. have designed and synthesized nickel bis(dithiolene)‐based gelators containing pendant cholesteryl moieties [186]. They have fabricated gels using these metal complexes that form intertwined fibers. It was observed that the nickel bis(dithiolene) derivatives exhibit efficient absorption of NIR light comparable to GNPs and convert it into heat in the gel matrix. Taking advantage of this photothermal property, the stability of the gels could be modulated by NIR light irradiation. Such photothermal gels could offer new opportunities in materials science and nanotechnology owing to the facile realization of photo thermal gelators.\nWang et al. have developed an injectable hydrogel that can be used to carry out photothermal therapy of cancer [187]. Interestingly, the hydrogel could be degraded on demand following therapy to clear out from the body, thereby reducing the risk of cytotoxicity that arises due to long‐term retention of hydro gel in the body. The hydrogel is based on alginatecalcium, which immobilizes platinum nanoparticles containing dendrimers (Figure  1.15). The hydrogel is biocompatible and degrades upon injection of appropriate chelates. Here the\ndendrimer‐encapsulated platinum nanoparticles act as photothermal centers and raise the surrounding temperature upon NIR irradiation. It has been observed that this hydrogel could ablate tumors when coated onto the tumor instead of being injected into it. This protocol of injection and on‐demand deg radation of the hydrogel in cancer photothermal therapy is attractive since it not only reduces the adverse effects but also drastically diminishes toxicity in the body.\nZheng et al. developed supramolecular hydrogels that are capable of exhibiting switchable size and dynamic mechanical properties in response to light of differ ent wavelengths (Figure 1.16) [188]. The gel containing dendrimer‐encapsulated platinum nanoparticles displays softening and stiffening in response to UV and NIR light irradiation. The gel is found to shrink in size upon NIR light irradia tion; however, it recovers when the NIR source is put off. A photothermally driven high‐strength double‐network gel has been developed, which exhibits IR‐ light‐induced actuation behavior [189].\nMohamed et al. have investigated the dynamics of hot electrons and phonons of GNPs that are inserted in gel matrices and irradiated by laser pulses [190].\nElectron–phonon and phonon–phonon coupling relaxation times have been found to increase in the hydrogel and organogel matrices compared to the aque ous solution. Kim and Lee have developed hydrogel‐coated GNPs with different shell thicknesses [191]. Owing to the biocompatibility of the hydrogel polymer shell, these hybrid nanoparticles could serve as drug delivery vehicles. Moreover, the hydrogel shell of the nanoparticles could be easily thermally activated by exposure to light with wavelengths that fall in the plasmon absorption band of the GNP core. Kawano et al. designed and synthesized gel‐coated GNRs [192]. These hybrid core–shell nanorods served as heating centers in targeted delivery in response to NIR laser irradiation. They show remote and reversible in vivo action upon NIR irradiation. These nanorods can be employed as probes for in vivo imaging techniques. In vivo fabrication of hydrogels needs delivery of two different solutions that would spontaneously cross‐link upon mixing. However, in such processes the kinetics of gelation is difficult to control. To address this issue, Gramlich et al. carried out transdermal gelation using GNRs and NIR light irradiation [193]. The heat produced during NIR irradiation of the nanorods\n1 Soft Materials Driven by Photothermal Effect and Their Applications26\nbrings about polymerization leading to gelation. The characteristics of gels thus produced could be modulated spatially and temporally by changing the experi mental parameters. This method is a promising protocol toward gelation through tissue using light that could penetrate tissue without harmful effects.\nStowers et al. have demonstrated dynamic tuning of the stiffness of a 3D hydro gel by light irradiation [194]. Hydrogels are widely used to unravel the role of stiffness on cell behavior since cell phenotype is greatly affected by the stiffness of the extracellular matrix. However, in biological processes the change in matrix stiffness is dynamic. In this context, a hydrogel with tunable stiffness over time could serve as a model system. For this purpose, they developed a system where alginate gel stiffness can be temporally modulated. The stiffness modulation of the gel was carried out by light‐triggered release of calcium or a chelate from liposomes (Figure 1.17). Both dynamic stiffening and softening have been dem onstrated in the system. This method could be extended to transdermal stiffness modulation by IR light irradiation.\nCollins et al. have investigated charge modulation of a GNR in an ion gel device [195]. GNRs were added into an ion gel capacitor and changes in the electron concentration were studied using dark‐field imaging spectroscopy.\nPark et al. have developed a drug delivery system based on micro‐organogels and loaded with GNRs [196]. They prepared the micro‐organogels by emulsifica tion technique using gelator fiber and vegetable oil, which served as a bio compatible drug carrier. A nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory model drug was encapsulated into the micro‐organogel matrix for evaluation of the drug delivery properties. The drug delivery system released the model drug slowly in the absence of NIR light irradiation. However, upon exposure to NIR light the drug release was significantly accelerated owing to temperature increase of the GNR‐ containing drug delivery system that transforms the gel into liquid (Figure 1.18). The micro‐organogel nanocomposite has the potential for on‐demand drug delivery applications.\nSershen et al. have demonstrated independent control of microfluidic valves using nanocomposite hydrogels containing GNPs [197]. The hydrogel has been formed by poly(N‐isopropylacrylamide), which exhibits reversible thermal phase changes. Fluid flow through the valves can be controlled by adjusting the intensity of the light source. Shiotani et  al. have observed light‐driven fast shrinking of a polymer hydrogel that was loaded with GNRs [198]. A model drug‐loaded composite was prepared from the hydrogel and it was observed that the system rapidly releases the drug upon NIR laser irradiation. Moreover, irra diation region‐specific release of the drug has been demonstrated by taking advantage of the high spatial resolution of light irradiation of the nanocomposite gel. Erdogan et al. have shown light‐triggered control of degelation in peptide‐ based organogels embedded with GNPs [199]. They have used GNPs of different sizes and different shapes to evaluate their degelation capability under light irra diation. The control over degelation of biological molecules could offer promis ing possibilities in nanomedicine, drug delivery, nanodiagnostics, and tissue engineering. Zhou et  al. have fabricated photothermally responsive hydrogel nanocomposites and developed micropatterned bilayer photoactuators that exhibit rapid and reversible bending and unbending movements upon\nexposure to visible light [200]. Light‐waveguided through optical fiber directly into the photoactuator film has been found to be equally effective in causing actuation as free space light.\nLo et al. have developed a new light‐responsive poly(N‐isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel nanocomposite incorporating glycidyl‐methacrylate‐functionalized graphene oxide [201]. The hydrogel nanocomposites were produced using pho topolymerization technique. The highly efficient photothermal conversion of glycidyl methacrylate‐functionalized graphene oxide was found to cause large volume change of the nanocomposite hydrogels upon exposure to IR light. This large volume change has been exploited in the fabrication and operation of a microvalve that is able to control fluidic flow in the channel by remote actuation with IR light. Zhang et  al. have fabricated CNT‐containing hydrogel polymer composites and investigated their responsive behavior [202]. The polymer hydrogel was obtained using poly(N‐isopropylacrylamide). Polymer hydrogel nanocomposites were fabricated by dispersing single‐walled CNTs into the soft hydrogel matrix. Fast photomechanical actuation was observed in the hydrogel nanocomposites upon exposure to NIR light due to strong absorption by the CNTs. The response time of the actuators could be tuned by varying the loading level of CNTs in the matrix. Cubes and flowers capable of self‐folding have been demonstrated using the polymer hydrogel nanocomposites. Zhang et al. fabri cated graphene‐oxide‐containing polymer hydrogel nanocomposites capable of IR‐light‐driven actuation [203]. They have prepared a bilayer architecture using\n1.4 Gels Driven by Photothermal Effect 29\ngraphene‐oxide‐containing hydrogel and another hydrogel without graphene oxide. Upon IR irradiation the bilayer undergoes anisotropic bending motion due to the temperature increase in the hydrogel layer containing graphene oxide particles.\nZhu et al. synthesized a hydrogel nanocomposite containing graphene oxide and investigated its photothermal responsiveness [204]. The hydrogel was syn thesized by in situ polymerization of N‐isopropylacrylamide monomers in an aqueous solution dispersed with graphene oxide. The gel exhibits reversible phase transition upon irradiation with NIR laser. They have demonstrated the application potential of the nanocomposite gel in a microfluidic device for con trolled fluid flow (Figure 1.19a–d). Such gels with superior photothermal sensi tivity could find application in biomaterials and biomedical devices.\nFujigaya et al. have studied reversible volume change in CNT‐containing gels upon NIR light irradiation [206]. These nanocomposite gels were found to pos sess excellent fatigue resistance during ON/OFF cycles. Li et al. have developed hydrogel nanocomposites by incorporating graphene oxide into a polymer matrix [207]. The hydrogels can be facilely triggered by NIR light irradiation. Using these functional gels as 3D scaffolds they demonstrated reversible cell cap ture and on‐demand release by light exposure. Wang et al. have developed light‐ driven hydrogel actuators from genetically engineered elastin‐like polypeptides doped with reduced graphene oxide particles [208]. Tunable motions with spatial resolution such as finger‐like flexing as well as crawling has been demonstrated in these hybrid systems that can be controlled by varying different parameters of light source. Cong et al. have demonstrated water treatment using a thermore sponsive nanocomposite hydrogel containing graphene particles [209]. These mechanically robust hydrogel composites exhibited high adsorption capacity and good recyclability in treating water. Reduced‐graphene‐oxide‐dispersed hydrogel composites have been used for the fabrication of bendable bilayer‐type photoactuators that can be driven by visible light irradiation [210].\nSatarkar et  al. have reported the fabrication and investigation of remote‐ controlled microfluidic valves using magnetic nanoparticle hydrogels [211]. Gallium‐based liquid metal alloys are recently attracting considerable attention in microfluidic devices as functional fluid microcomponents such as valves, heaters, and electrodes [212, 213]. Local switching of chemical patterns has been achieved by Yoon et al. employing the creased surface of a hydrogel [214]. The hydrogel was impregnated with iron oxide nanoparticles, which exhibit photo thermal effect. Upon exposure to light the hydrogel temperature rises due to the photothermal conversion by the iron oxide nanoparticles, which causes vol ume change in the system. Light‐controlled microvalves have been developed by Lee et al. using hydrogels incorporated with photothermal iron oxide nanoparti cles [215]. For this purpose, they prepared the hydrogel composite that is capable of fast response and substantial volume change upon exposure to light. Movable position heating source [216], photoactuators from comb‐type hydrogels [217], and stimuli‐responsive hydrogel microfibers [218] have been obtained using photothermal magnetic nanoparticles dispersed into hydrogel matrices.\nHsiao et  al. have used in situ formed NIR‐absorbing micellar hydrogels in photothermal tumor ablation [205]. They have designed and synthesized a\n1 Soft Materials Driven by Photothermal Effect and Their Applications30\nchitosan derivative functionalized with conjugated polymer polyaniline as side chains. This covalently linked hybrid polymer material is able to self‐assemble into micelles. The micelles could be transformed into hydrogels by appropriately adjusting the pH of the micellar solution. Owing to the presence of the conduct ing polymer polyaniline in its structure, the micelles are able to absorb NIR light and convert it into heat. This photothermal property of the micelles was used in the selective destruction of cancer cells in light‐exposed areas. The efficiency of the micellar hydrogel in photothermal therapy has been evaluated using a tumor‐bearing mouse model (Figure  1.19e). This model study demonstrated\n1.5 Summary and Outlook 31\nthat  biocompatible NIR‐absorbing micellar hydrogels can be formed in the target site for minimal invasive photothermal treatment of cancer."

      "text" : "The combination of soft materials and photothermal agents is emerging as an enabling endeavor. Functional soft composite materials fabricated by bringing these two classes of interesting materials have been demonstrated to act as actu ators, therapeutic agents, drug delivery systems, microvalves, etc. Remotely trig gered photoinduced phase transitions have been carried out by taking advantage of the photothermal effects of the photothermal agents. Inorganic metal (gold, platinum) nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials (CNTs, graphene derivatives), and organic compounds (small molecule dyes and con ducting polymers) have been employed as photothermal agents to drive LCs, polymers, and gels. The photothermal effect of GNPs has been used in drug delivery application of lyotropic LCs and they have enabled optical property modulation of self‐assembled thermotropic 1D and 3D photonic crystals. Light‐ driven dynamic shape morphing and photomechanical actuations such as bending, twisting, folding, and oscillations have been achieved by combining photothermal agents with functional polymers and elastomers. Photothermally activated hydrogels have been employed in efficient water treatment and control of fluid flow in microfluidic devices. Smart and adaptive systems have been real ized by dispersing photothermal agents into soft matter matrices. Synergy between the properties of soft materials and photothermal agents has been found to enhance the functionalities of the stimuli‐responsive composites. In addition to physical mixing of photothermal agents with the soft matrices, they have also been covalently conjugated in the systems to fabricate better performing and robust materials. In many instances, the photothermal agents have been suitably functionalized to enhance their compatibility and homogeneous dispersion in the host matrices, thereby increasing their efficiency. However, phase separation at higher loading amounts remains an issue with the photothermal agents, which requires a great deal of attention. In drug delivery and photothermal therapy the long‐term toxicity of the agents needs to be systematically evaluated before they could be clinically viable. Inorganic nanoparticles, being nondegradable, could accumulate in the cell and cause toxicity if they are not efficiently cleared from the body after they have performed their job. To address this issue, appropriate physical and chemical functionalization of inorganic nanoparticles is being developed and assessed. However, it needs extensive evaluation by materials sci entists and clinicians for commercial applications. Organic photothermal agents have certain advantages over their inorganic counterparts; however, it is neces sary to make a different variety of organic agents available for use. The covalent linking of conjugated polymers and NIR‐absorbing dyes with soft matter compo nents seems to be a promising approach to take advantage of the photothermal effect of organic agents; nevertheless, robust and versatile functionalization pro tocols that are facile and benign need to be developed and optimized to exploit the full potential of organic photothermal agents. The work accomplished in\n1 Soft Materials Driven by Photothermal Effect and Their Applications32\ndriving soft materials by photothermal effect and the applications demonstrated have laid the groundwork for further exploration. This area of research is in its early infancy and it is expected to make great strides in materials science, nano technology, bioscience, and beyond with the availability of appropriately engi neered materials and processing techniques."

      "text" : "According to the definition by Meijer and coworkers in their seminal review [1], supramolecular polymers are polymeric assemblies of small molecular units that are brought together through reversible and directional noncovalent interactions, leading to polymeric properties in solution and bulk states [1–5]. Owing to the reversible nature of their main‐chain formation, supramolecular polymers  have attracted considerable attention as highly stimuli‐responsive polymeric materials compared to conventional polymer counterparts. Needless to say, supramolecular polymers have high responsiveness in terms of “degree of polymerization” to temperature change mainly due to entropic reasons, and to solvent media mainly due to enthalpic reasons. Such high responsiveness to external environment has enabled not only the exploration of temperature‐ and solvent‐dependent supramolecular polymer systems, but also the analyses of the supramolecular polymerization process regulated by these parameters [6]. From a technical viewpoint, furthermore, supramolecular polymers have another advantage over conventional polymers, i.e. quite ambient polymerization conditions without using any chemical reagents. This allows more flexible monomer design and enables introduction of a wide variety of functional molecules into supramolecular monomers.\nAnother possible advantage coming from the reversible nature of supramolecular polymers can be found when one can directly manipulate the structures of monomer units by external stimuli. Because the overall enthalpic and entropic contributions to stabilizing supramolecular polymers depend strongly on the conformation and flexibility of monomer units, the alteration of these factors for monomer units should establish a new equilibrium for the given supramolecular polymer systems. Although temperature and solvent could induce large changes in the state and the structure of supramolecular polymers, they are not “specific” for molecular components  –  not “directional” as stimuli, and not “well‐ controllable” in terms of on–off switching. In this sense, the utilization of\nPhotoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers Yuichi Kitamoto, Keisuke Aratsu, and Shiki Yagai\nChiba University, Institute for Global Prominent Research (IGPR) and Division of Advanced Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, 1‐33 Yayoi‐cho, Inage‐ku, Chiba, 263‐8522, Japan\n46 2 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers\nphotochromic molecules is a very reasonable approach to control the structure of monomer units at will [7–10]. When a reversible transformation between two photoisomers having different absorption bands is induced by light of a specific wavelength region, fully regulated two‐state photoswitch of the monomer structure can be achieved. Furthermore, in comparison with other chemical reactions using chemical substance, photochromic reactions generally produce no chemical wastes, and their repeatability is a very intriguing property that is reminiscent of biochemical transformations and photoregulation systems omnipresent in living systems. Accordingly, many supramolecular chemists have designed a variety of photochromic monomer units and noncovalently polymerized them to establish diverse photoresponsive supramolecular polymers showing a photocontrollable degree of aggregation and/or supramolecular architectures. However, it has not been overviewed yet how photoinduced structure changes in monomer units can induce a variety of changes in the structures and properties of supramolecular polymers.\nThis chapter highlights how we can utilize photochromic molecules to control (i) the degree of supramolecular polymerization, (ii) the supramolecular polymerization process, and (iii) topologies of one‐dimensional chains. The first topic will be illustrated by focusing on photoresponsive supramolecular polymers based on host–guest and  metal-ligand  complexation (Section  2.2), complementary hydrogen‐bonding interactions (Section  2.3), and π–π stacking interactions between photochromic moieties (Section 2.4). For the second topic, supramolecular polymers based on π–π stacking interactions play important roles to discuss the underpinning principles (Section  2.4). The third topic will address specific design of supramolecular monomers inducing topological changes of one‐dimensional supramolecular chains, along with maintaining the degree of polymerization during photoisomerization (Section 2.5). The application of photochromic molecules for other functional materials, such as vesicles, micelles, gels, organic nanotubes, biomolecular systems, and molecular machines, are summarized in other important reviews [11–17], and hence we do not address these issues in this chapter. Photoresponsive liquid crystals, which are one of the important smart soft materials, can also be studied in the other chapters of this book."

      "heading" : "2.2 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers by Host–Guest and Coordination Systems",
      "text" : "The manipulation of association and dissociation events in supramolecular host– guest complexes by light has been attempted already in the late 1980s by Shinkai et al. [18]. A self‐complementary azobenzene derivative 1 bearing an ω‐ammoniumalkyl moiety on one end and a crown ether moiety on the other end was designed to  form crown–ammonium complexes either intermolecularly or intramole cularly (tail‐biting), depending on the isomeric form of the azobenzene core (Figure 2.1a). Although the polymerizable trans‐isomer affords only cyclic oligomers by the intermolecular complexation, upon trans‐to‐cis photoisomerization it transforms into a “dormant” monomer by the intramolecular complexation of the bent cis‐isomer. They have also developed photocontrollable polymeric\n48 2 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers\nsupramolecular complexes consisting of a ditopic azobis(benzocrown ether)  2 and an oligomethylene‐α,ω‐diammonium cation 3 (Figure  2.1b) [19]. This binary system also shows a similar result with that of 1. Accordingly, these systems already demonstrated a basic idea for creating photoresponsive supramolecular polymers based on host–guest supramolecular chemistry.\nCyclodextrin is one of the most important macrocyclic host molecules applied to numerous research fields [20–25]. Harada and coworkers developed a photoresponsive host–guest supramolecular polymer by using a stilbene‐ bridged bis(β‐cyclodextrin) 4 as a macrocyclic host and a ditopic adamantane guest 5 (Figure 2.2). The trans‐to‐cis and cis‐to‐trans isomerization of the stilbene‐bis(β‐cyclodextrin) 4 are reversibly controllable in aqueous solution with UV‐light irradiation at 365 and 254 nm, respectively. Rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) analysis revealed that adamantane guest 5 can complex with both the trans‐ and cis‐isomers of 4 (trans‐ and cis‐4). The trans‐4 formed 1  : 1 supramolecular dimers or small assemblies with 5, which was suggested from concentration‐independent hydrodynamic radius (Dh) observed by pulse field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Upon UV‐light irradiation with 365 nm, the Dh value became smaller with increasing concentration of the mixtures, which demonstrated  that  the photogenerated cis‐4 formed linear supramolecular polymers upon complexing with 5. AFM measurements showed that the mixture of trans‐4 and 5 produced only small objects with the overall lengths of c. 30 nm. Conversely, for the mixture of cis‐4 and 5, supramolecular wires with the overall lengths of c. 350 nm were visualized [26].\nFrom the standpoint of versatile macrocyclic host molecules, pillar[n]arenes have attracted increasing interest owing to an outstanding applicability to various supramolecular systems based on host–guest chemistry [27, 28]. As the inventor of pillar[n]arenes, Ogoshi et al. established photoreversible supramolecular copolymerization of an azobenzene‐bridged bis(pillar[5]arene) 6 as a ditopic host with hexamethylenebis(pyridinium) 7 as a ditopic guest (Figure 2.3) [29]. Diffusion-ordered  NMR  spectroscopy  (DOSY) and 1H NMR analyses in dichloromethane‐d2 (CD2Cl2) revealed that the host–guest mixture of the trans‐ isomer of 6 (trans‐6) and 7 affords supramolecular copolymers in high concentration. Upon irradiation of the mixture with UV light (λ = 365 nm), a significant increase of the diffusion constant (D) was observed, indicating a disassociation of the supramolecular copolymers into relatively low molecular weight oligomers composed of cis‐6 and 7. The photoresponsive assembly and disassembly processes have been shown reversibly by alternating irradiation of the mixture with UV and visible (λ = 436 nm) light. Other host–guest supramolecular polymers including calix[n]arenes [30–32] and cucurbit[n]urils [33] have also been applied to photoresponsive polymerization/depolymerization systems. These photoswitchable host–guest supramolecular polymers can find a wide range of applications, for instance, self‐healable supramolecular gels and vesicles, controllable aggregation of particles, and others [34–37].\nMetal–ligand interactions are also useful to construct well‐defined supramolecular architectures [38–40]. Huang and coworkers successfully prepared\na  photoresponsive metallosupramolecular polymer using a stiff stilbene functionalized with pyridine ligands [41]. They designed a stiff stilbene derivative 8 bearing two pyridyl groups as a ligand and a bis(trans‐Pt(II))benzene complex 9 as a precursor of the metal center (Figure 2.4a). Multinuclear NMR and ESI‐MS measurements showed that equimolar mixing of the cis‐isomer of 8 (cis‐8) with  bis‐Pt(II) complex 9 in CH2Cl2 yielded a discrete metallocyclic tetramer (cis‐82·92) with high efficiency. Upon UV‐light irradiation (λ = 387 nm) of the solution of the metallacycles, cis‐to‐trans photoisomerization of 8 occurred, which gave rise to the transformation from the discrete metallacycles to linear metallosupramolecular polymers (Figure  2.4b), as evidenced by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. Upon trans‐to‐cis back isomerization of 8 with UV‐light irradiation (λ = 360 nm), however, quantitative formation of the original discrete metallacycle was not observed as a result of a cis:trans ratio of 47 : 53 at a photostationary state (PSS). Instead, the average Dh of the resulting aggregates was larger than that of the original discrete metallacycles, suggesting the\n52 2 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers\nformation of metallocyclic oligomers by integrative self‐sorting of cis‐ and trans‐8 with 9 (Figure 2.4b) [42]. The transformation between the linear metallosupramolecular polymers and the metallocyclic oligomers was photochemically reversible by alternating irradiation at the two wavelengths. The authors presumed that the photoresponsive transformation would proceed in an off‐ pathway mechanism. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis revealed that spherical nanoparticles formed by the discrete metallacycles converted upon UV‐light irradiation at 387 nm into long nanofibers with a width of c. 50 nm and a length of >1 μm."

      "heading" : "2.3 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers by Complementary Hydrogen Bonds",
      "text" : "This section focuses on photoresponsive supramolecular polymers, wherein photochromic units are noncovalently polymerized through multiple hydrogen‐ bonding interactions. The high reversibility of hydrogen bonds plays an essential role in the dynamic properties of many supramolecular polymers. Because photoisomerization of azobenzene and other photochromic molecules generally occurs on subpicosecond to picosecond timescales, monomer units can change their structures upon absorbing light in the monomeric state supplied through aggregate–monomer exchange/reshuffling even though they are very tightly aggregated. The photoisomerized monomers should reassemble to form different assembled structures or even remain monomeric as a result of alteration of conformation or flexibility by photoisomerization.\nGhadiri and coworkers designed a pioneering photoresponsive supramolecular oligomer by using a peptide‐functionalized azobenzene 10, wherein two macrocyclic octapeptides can noncovalently dimerize through multiple hydrogen‐ bonding interactions (Figure 2.5) [43]. The trans‐isomer of 10 intermolecularly self‐assembled to form linear and polydisperse hydrogen‐bonded aggregates in chloroform (CHCl3). NMR studies revealed that upon UV‐light irradiation at 366 nm the linear aggregates transform into discrete species due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Although these photoswitchable assembled states are reversible, a remarkable resistance of the cis‐to‐trans thermal isomerization was observed as a result of the strong intramolecular hydrogen‐bonding interactions. An analogous effect was observed for the host–guest complex of 2 with alkali metal cations [44].\nComplementary multiple hydrogen‐bonding (CMHB) interactions are essential for the biological recognition process and are one of the most powerful tools to control the organization of small molecular building blocks. High directionality and specificity with reversibility of CMHB interactions have motivated many  supramolecular chemists to create various supramolecular assemblies. For example, compounds having complementary centrosymmetric hydrogen‐ bonding arrays, such as DAD and ADA (D = hydrogen bond donor, A = hydrogen bond acceptor), are capable of assembling into cyclic or polymeric aggregates [45]. Because heteroaromatic compounds generally possess a rigid and geometrically well‐defined skeleton, they can be used as highly specific and directional\n54 2 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers\nmultiple hydrogen‐bonding modules. Needless to say, their high fidelity is epitomized by the base‐pairing in DNA and RNA strands. The conceptual background and studies of CMHB interactions organizing functional dyes and π‐conjugated systems have been addressed in several reviews [46–49].\nUreidopyrimidinone (Upy) is one of the most widely used CMHB units to prepare supramolecular polymers. A mono‐Upy derivative 11 has been known to dimerize in even CHCl3 with a high dimerization constant exceeding 106 M−1 [50]. Meijer and coworkers first demonstrated supramolecular polymers based on CMHB interactions by using a self‐complementary bis‐Upy derivative 12. To control the degree of polymerization of 12 by light, they developed a photoresponsive depolymerization system by in situ photogeneration of chain stopper 11 (Figure 2.6) [51]. For this purpose, they designed a “caged” stopper 13 protected with ortho‐nitrobenzyl ether group. Compound 13 was smoothly photodeprotected to give stopper molecule 11 by UV‐light irradiation [52], which can be confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Viscosity (ηrel) measurements of a supramolecular polymer solution of 12 in CDCl3 in the presence of 0.1 equiv. of 13 showed that after two hours of irradiation with UV light, the original ηrel value of 10.79 drastically decreased to c. 1.92, comparable to the value observed in the presence of 0.1 equiv. of externally added 11 instead of 13. The significant drop in ηrel value indicates that the formation of hetero‐ assemblies of in situ\n552.3 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers by Complementary Hydrogen Bonds\nphotogenerated 11 with 12 inhibits the self‐ assembly of 12, leading to phototriggered depolymerization of supramolecular polymers of 12.\nThe open‐ and closed‐ring isomers of diarylethenes are generally  thermally inactive toward reversible isomerization [53, 54], which enables more stable and sustainable two‐state switching in comparison with azobenzene systems [55, 56]. Takeshita et  al. prepared a diarylethene derivative 14 functionalized on both ends by Upy quadruple hydrogen‐bonding groups (Figure  2.7) [57]. 1H NMR study of the open‐ring isomer of 14 (14open) in CDCl3 showed no shifts of the NH proton signals, and only small particles less than 10 nm were detected by DLS. The ring‐closing reaction of 14open proceeded in CHCl3 with a quantum yield of 0.26, indicating that the major and minor conformers are antiparallel and parallel, respectively [58]. DLS measurements showed that UV‐light irradiation (λ = 366 nm) of the CHCl3–ethanol (97 : 3) solution of 14open resulted in a gradual increase in the original particle size (<10 nm), which became constant at around 650 nm after three hours, indicating the formation of supramolecular polymers by the photogenerated closed‐ring isomer 14closed. Subsequent visible‐light irradiation (λ > 540 nm) decreased the particle size from 650 to 400 nm, whereas the resulting supramolecular aggregates with the size of c. 400 nm did not further collapse even after the ring‐opening reaction was accomplished. Conversely, after aging the solution at 60 °C for 30 minutes, the aggregates disassembled into the original small particles (<10 nm). The author concluded that the strong CMHB interactions prevent the large aggregates consisting of antiparallel 14open from disassembling into its own small aggregates.\nIntermolecular photoreactions such as photocyclization and photodimerization reactions observed for acenes can also be applied to designing photoresponsive supramolecular polymers. Arai and coworkers employed a [4  +  4] photodimerization reaction to establish a photoreversible supramolecular polymer system [59]. Anthracene 15 equipped with an Upy moiety initially formed hydrogen‐bonded dimers in CDCl3 (Figure  2.8a). 1H NMR and UV–vis studies  showed that 15 undergoes photodimerization upon UV‐light irradiation (>310 nm) in CDCl3 to form the photodimer 16. The NH proton signals associated with intermolecular hydrogen bonds became broadened upon photodimerization, and the signals eventually became too broad to be observed after reaching a PSS (conversion = c. 80%), indicating the formation of oligomeric and/or polymeric assemblies consisting of 16. Considering the conversion yield at the PSS, hydrogen‐bonded oligomers of 16 should be capped with unreacted 15 (Figure 2.8b). The photoinduced oligomerization also showed thermal reversibility: upon heating the resulting oligomer solution at 125 °C, the retro‐reaction quantitatively proceeded with the rate constant of 3 × 10−4  s−1. Since the temperatures at which the half‐life of the photodimer is one hour are very different between a “head‐to‐head” photodimer (38 °C) and a “head‐to‐tail” photodimer (149 °C) for 9‐methylanthracene, the above result also suggests that the photodimer 16 has a “head‐to‐tail” conformation [60].\nYang and coworkers described a photoresponsive supramolecular polymer based on a stiff stilbene derivative 17 functionalized with Upy moieties (Figure  2.9a) [61]. Unlike azobenzene, cis‐to‐trans thermal isomerization of\n592.3 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers by Complementary Hydrogen Bonds\nstilbene is negligibly slow at temperatures below c. 147 °C [62]. 1H NMR and DOSY spectra of 17 (c = 5 × 10−2 M) in CDCl3 revealed that cis‐17 (at a PSS, >99%) forms two distinct species corresponding to a cyclic dimer as the major component and a monomer as the minor component. In contrast, trans‐17 (at a PSS, >99%) displayed smaller diffusion constants compared with cis‐17, indicating that trans‐17 can self‐assemble into supramolecular polymers. No critical point was observed for trans‐17 in viscosity measurements upon increasing its concentration. For cis‐17, however, the critical polymerization concentration (c. 0.1 M) was observed. On the basis of the viscosity measurements, it was proposed that the supramolecular polymerization of cis‐17 proceeds via a ring– chain exchange mechanism in concentrations above 0.1 M, whereas trans‐17 follows an isodesmic growth mechanism (Figure  2.9b). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation at high concentration (0.4 M) revealed that cis‐17 self‐assembles into nanofibers with diameters of 0.3–3 μm and lengths of hundreds of micrometers, whereas trans‐17 forms a gel. UV‐light irradiation (λ = 365 nm) of the gel of trans‐17 caused the trans‐to‐cis photoisomerization to give cis‐17, leading to the dissolution of the gel.\nChi et al. reported a photoreversible transformation of hydrogen‐bond‐directed helical supramolecular polymers of a diarylethene derivative (S,S)‐18 to granular aggregates (Figure 2.10) [63]. The supramolecular chirality is governed by (S)‐ phenylalanine moieties of (S,S)‐18 and detected through excitonic coupling of naphthalimide chromophores cross‐linking diarylethene and (S)‐phenylalanine moieties of (S,S)‐18 (Figure 2.10a). In tetrachloromethane (CCl4), the open‐ring isomer of (S,S)‐18 ((S,S)‐18open) showed a sharp circular dichroism (CD) signal with a characteristic Cotton effect corresponding to the absorption regions of the diarylethene and naphthalimide chromophores. The methyl ester derivative of (S,S)‐18open showed much weaker CD signals compared with the carboxylic acid (S,S)‐18open, suggesting that (S,S)‐18open forms chiral supramolecular assemblies through intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the carboxylic groups. AFM visualized left‐handed helical nanofibers with a height of c. 6 nm and a helical pitch of c. 50 nm (Figure 2.10b). Upon UV‐light irradiation (λ = 365 nm) of the CCl4 solution of (S,S)‐18open, the CD signal remarkably decreased with the photoconversion of (S,S)‐18open to afford (S,S)‐18closed in 48% yield at a PSS. AFM showed the transformation of the original helical nanofibers into the granular particles (Figure 2.10c). The authors attributed this transformation to the rigidity of the diarylethene core, which hampers (S,S)‐18closed from adopting a helical geometry. This morphology transformation is completely photoreversible, as AFM imaging after the visible‐light irradiation (λ > 510 nm) recovered the original helical nanofibers with the active CD signals (Figure 2.10d). The optical isomer (R,R)‐18open showed the mirror image CD signal of the one observed for (S,S)‐18open, and AFM image for (R,R)‐18open confirmed right‐handed helical nanofibers. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular modeling, the authors proposed that the parallel conformer of (S,S)‐18open can self‐assemble through intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic groups to form primary helical strands (Figure 2.10e,f ), which further organize into secondary helical fibers to accommodate the structural strain of the primary helical strands (Figure 2.10g). Considering this proposed assembled model, it can\n612.4 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers by Stacking of Photochromic Molecules\nbe inferred that the photoinduced transformation could proceed via aggregate– monomer exchange, although the authors did not describe this (see Section 2.1).\nYagai et al. have designed a unique photoresponsive supramolecular polymer wherein the parallel conformer of a diarylethene monomer engages actively in supramolecular polymerization [64]. Based on the previous study on photoresponsive supramolecular complexes composed of a melamine‐functionalized diarylethene and a barbiturated merocyanine dye [65], they newly synthesized a tetratopic diarylethene receptor 19 bearing ditopic melamine groups on both ends and investigated the complexation with a ditopic tetraphenoxy perylene bisimide (PBI) guest 20, which has a propensity to form slipped (J‐type) aggregates (Figure 2.11a) [66, 67]. UV–vis titration experiments of 20 with the open‐ ring isomer of 19 (19open) in toluene revealed the formation of 2 : 1 supramolecular co‐assemblies [19open·(20)2]n, wherein the PBI chromophores form a J‐type stacking mode. AFM imaging of [19open·(20)2]n showed well‐defined nanofibers with lengths reaching nearly a micrometer‐scale regime (Figure 2.11b). A close‐ up AFM imaging revealed that the nanofibers have a helically twisted topology with a height of 2 nm and a helical pitch of 20 nm (inset in Figure 2.11b). Based on the spectroscopic and morphological observations, the authors constructed an oligomeric co‐assembly composed of the parallel conformer of 19open and the dimeric J‐type stack (J‐dimer) of 20 by means of force‐field molecular mechanics calculation, which could reproduce the helically extended structure due to the twisted geometry of 19 (Figure 2.11d,e). Upon UV‐light irradiation (λ = 313 nm) of the toluene solution of [19open·(20)2]n, photocyclization of 19open proceeded to afford 19closed while maintaining the J‐band. AFM observations revealed that the helical nanofibers were converted to granular nanostructures with diameters of c. 10 nm and heights of c. 1.2 nm (Figure 2.11c). Because the conrotatory photocyclization can proceed only from the antiparallel conformer of 19open [68, 69], aggregate–monomer exchange should occur to afford monomeric 19open, which quickly reaches parallel–antiparallel conformational equilibrium. The ring‐ opening reaction of 19closed by visible‐light irradiation (λ = 630 nm) reproduced 19open, and reconstructed the original fibrous nanostructures. This cycle could be repeated at least three times, thus demonstrating the photoreversibility of this supramolecular system. Notably, the granular aggregates composed of 19closed and the J‐dimer (20)2 cannot be obtained if 19closed and 20 were directly mixed. Accordingly, the J‐dimer as well as the granular nanostructures could form only through the photoconversion of supramolecular copolymers [19open·(20)2]n (Figure 2.11f )."

      "text" : "In Section 2.3, we focused on photoresponsive supramolecular polymers whose main chains are formed by hydrogen bonds. Another fascinating approach to supramolecular polymers is the use of π–π stacking interactions between functional π‐conjugated molecules. Because most photochromic molecules have\n632.4 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers by Stacking of Photochromic Molecules\nfertile π‐conjugated systems, they are expected to self‐assemble into one‐ dimensional aggregates by proper functionalization with auxiliary interacting units. Moreover, photochromic molecules show fruitful changes in their molecular structures and chemical properties upon photoisomerization. This can be exploited to control or regulate the degree of supramolecular polymerization under proper conditions.\nIn the case of azobenzene, the trans‐isomer has a planar geometry favorable for π–π stacking, whereas the cis‐isomer has a bent conformation unfavorable for π–π stacking [70, 71]. Yagai et al. reported an archetypal example of photoresponsive supramolecular polymers consisting of azobenzene‐appended hydrogen‐bonded supermacrocycles (rosettes) [72–74]. A cyanurate dCA bearing sterically less bulky dodecyl groups aggregated complementarily with a bis(azobenzene)‐functionalized melamine 21 to afford rosette (21·dCA)3 in CHCl3, which further self‐assembles in nonpolar media into higher order columnar structures through π–π stacking interactions (Figure  2.12). At millimolar concentration regimes, this hierarchical association of rosettes resulted in the formation of elongated and entangled fibers organizing into organogels. Upon irradiation of cyclohexane organogels with UV light (λ = 350 nm), a gel‐to‐sol phase transition was observed even though the trans‐to‐cis photoisomerization efficiency was moderate (20–40% cis‐isomer, Figure 2.12b). The resulting solution phase could revert to the original gel phase with visible‐light irradiation (λ  =  450 nm) and subsequent aging (Figure  2.12b). Because the planarity of rosette (21·dCA)3 critically influences its stacking trend, even partial trans‐to‐cis isomerization of azobenzene moieties at the periphery can strongly deteriorate its supramolecular polymerization capability. In other words, the impact of photoinduced structural change of azobenzene on aggregation can be amplified through rosette formation. For a diluted supramolecular polymer solution, a similar photoresponsive behavior was confirmed by DLS measurements.\nA photoresponsive behavior in contrast to the above example has been reported by Pavan and coworkers [75] for supramolecular tubular nanoassemblies composed of a V‐shaped chiral azobenzene amphiphile 22 (Figure 2.13a). The original design of this amphiphilic molecule has been reported by Lee and coworkers, who demonstrated that a series of the V‐shaped amphiphiles organize into tubular supramolecular polymers through the formation of hexameric supermacrocycles [76–79]. For trans‐azobenzene‐appended 22 (trans,trans‐22), the formation of tubular nanoassemblies in aqueous solution has been confirmed by TEM observation. The external diameter of c. 7 nm roughly corresponds to the estimated diameter of the hexameric supermacrocycle of trans,trans‐22 from molecular models (Figure 2.13b). A pronounced Cotton effect was observed for the absorption region of the azobenzene chromophore in CD measurements, indicating that supermacrocycles stack with an offset arrangement in a preferred handedness. Interestingly, a nonlinear disassembly process was observed upon irradiation of the nanoassemblies with UV light (λ  =  365 nm). The initial five minutes of irradiation resulted in a drastic decrease of the CD signal at 400 nm despite the fact that the fraction of photogenerated cis‐isomer was only 7%. In the absorption spectra, a bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum was observed. These complex behaviors were ascribed to the annihilation of the\n66 2 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers\nhelical twist due to the formation of cis,trans‐22 and cis,cis‐22, which were still embedded in the tubular nanoassemblies. The collapse of the tubular nanoassemblies was probed by fluorescent analysis using Nile red as an internal probe that could be encapsulated in the tubules. A gradual release of this lipophilic dye was observed after the UV‐light irradiation for c. 10 minutes, as shown by a steady decrease in the fluorescence signal from the dye. The authors proposed that photogenerated cis,trans‐22 and cis,cis‐22 give birth to strain energy that can trigger the depolymerization of the tubular nanoassemblies, and disassembly of the tubules takes place when the amount of these cis‐isomers reaches the critical concentration. If water‐miscible organic solvents such as acetonitrile were added as a co‐solvent, the depolymerization process more linearly responded to  the increase of the cis‐isomers. The observation indicates that a far‐from‐ equilibrated state could be achieved in pure water to show the initial lag regime by producing strain but not breaking the assemblies.\nFor synthesis of covalent polymers, light is one of the attractive energy sources that can initiate covalent bond formation in a chain reaction, e.g. living radical polymerization, click reaction, and thiol–ene and thiol–yne coupling reactions [80, 81]. With respect to supramolecular polymerization, if nucleation and/or elongation steps could be regulated by photoinduced geometrical change of monomer units, such a photoinitiated process may realize precise supramolecular polymerization. In this regard, poorly aggregative photoisomers, e.g. cis‐ azobenzene, are promising “dormant” monomers that can retard spontaneous nucleation. Recently, Sugiyasu and coworkers have successfully employed phototriggered supramolecular polymerization of an azobenzene monomer to realize photoregulated living supramolecular polymerization [82]. According to the typical design strategy for functional organogelators, they designed and synthesized an amide‐functionalized azobenzene derivative 23 (Figure 2.14a). In this study, cis‐23 behaves as the dormant monomer that can be activated for supramolecular polymerization through cis‐to‐trans photoisomerization. Upon cooling a hot methylcyclohexane (MCH)‐toluene (9 : 1) solution of trans‐23 to 10 °C, the azobenzene absorption band bathochromically shifted in a nonsigmoidal manner against temperature change, suggesting the formation of J‐type aggregates via the cooperative nucleation–elongation mechanism. AFM observation showed linear supramolecular fibers with lengths of several micrometers (Figure 2.14b). In sharp contrast, cis‐23, which had been prepared by cooling a hot solution of trans‐23 with UV‐light irradiation (λ = 351 nm), afforded amorphous films, indicating the less aggregative nature of cis‐23 due to its bent conformation. Upon irradiation of cis‐23 with visible light (λ = 520 nm), spontaneous nucleation of the photogenerated trans‐23 occurred when its concentration reached critical value (~1.0 × 10−5 M). Accordingly, careful visible‐light irradiation of cis‐23 can kinetically supply the active monomer. Based on these preliminary results, they irradiated the solution of cis‐23 with visible light ([cis‐23]  =  3.75 × 10−5  M) but in the presence of “seeds” of trans‐23 ([seed] = 1.25 × 10−5 M). Interestingly, the absorption spectra did not show the formation of free monomer trans‐23 upon visible‐light irradiation, but the direct growth of the J‐aggregates was observed. This observation suggests the successful photoregulated living supramolecular polymerization at the termini of seeds.\nIndeed, the formation of nanofibers with controlled lengths and a narrow polydispersity were confirmed by AFM (Figure 2.14c,d).\nYagai et al. have applied phototriggered self‐assembly to prepare supramolecular polymers whose lengths are different from those prepared by thermodynamically controlled self‐assembly pathways. They previously reported that barbiturated naphthalene 24 can self‐assemble into well‐defined cylindrical supramolecular polymers through the formation of hydrogen‐bonded rosettes (Figure 2.15a) [83, 84]. To control the self‐assembly of 24, they newly designed and synthesized an azobenzene‐functionalized derivative 25 [85]. Upon cooling a hot MCH solution of trans‐25 to 20 °C, a hypsochromic shift was observed for\n692.4 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers by Stacking of Photochromic Molecules\nthe absorption band of the azobenzene chromophores, indicating H‐type stacking upon supramolecular polymerization. The plot of this absorption as a  function of temperature “(cooling curve)” follows a nucleation–elongation mechanism. Notably, the subsequent “heating curve” corresponding to the depolymerization process shifted toward higher temperatures in comparison with the cooling curve, showing a higher critical temperature Te than the elongation temperature Te′ in the cooling process. The observed thermal hysteresis suggests that the polymerization proceeds under a kinetically controlled process, which was also supported by a van’t Hoff analysis. AFM analysis showed that lengths of aggregates of trans‐25 are dependent on the cooling rate. Lengths of slowly prepared aggregates (Aggslow) with a cooling rate of 1.0 K min−1 exceeded 1000 nm, whereas those of kinetically prepared aggregates (Aggfast) by fast cooling (quenching) were in the range of 50–400 nm (Figure 2.15c,d). Upon UV‐light irradiation (λ = 365 nm) of the MCH solution of Aggslow at 20 °C, trans‐ to‐cis photoisomerization occurred (Figure  2.15b, trans:cis ratio at a PSS is 79 : 21) but no significant morphology change was observed. Conversely, when a cis‐25‐rich CHCl3 solution was injected into MCH, amorphous films were imaged by AFM. Subsequent irradiation of the cis‐rich solution with visible light (λ = 470 nm) reproduced a trans‐rich state (trans:cis = 98 : 2) in a short period of 10 seconds, thus allowing supramolecular polymerization of the photogenerated trans‐25 under very kinetic conditions. This phototriggered kinetic pathway enabled the formation of short cylindrical nanofibers (Aggvis) with a narrower polydispersity index (PDI = Lw/Ln = 1.26) compared with Aggfast (PDI = 1.50) (Figure 2.15e,f ). Different size distributions of the aggregates were also shown by DLS measurements (Figure  2.15g). In the case of the phototriggered kinetic pathway, the more “supercooled” situation might be realized compared to the quenching procedure. In such a state where diffusion of the solute is not sufficient to supply monomers to the nucleus formed at the initial stage, further nucleation of monomers can take place, leading to the formation of a greater amount of supramolecular polymers with smaller aggregation numbers (shorter lengths) compared to those formed by the quenching procedure. These kinetically trapped small aggregates might be useful as “seeds” for living supramolecular polymerization [86, 87].\nUnlike azobenzene‐based supramolecular monomers, the relative aggregation capabilities of the two isomeric forms of diarylethene vary depending on molecular design (Figure  2.16) [88–91]. For instance, in the case of amide‐ functionalized diarylethene 26 reported by Feringa and coworkers, the rigid closed‐ring isomer of 26 (26closed) can form thermally stable organogels in comparison with the open‐ring isomer 26open [88]. A similar trend was observed for an amphiphilic diarylethene 27 reported by Hirose et al., who found that 27closed can assemble into nanoaggregates in water through a π–π stacking interaction between the expanded π‐surfaces whereas 27open cannot assemble under the same condition [89].\nIn contrast, an inverse effect of the open‐ and closed‐ring isomers on the on/off switching of aggregation has been observed for a hydrogen‐bonding diarylethene 28 wherein the flexible open‐ring isomer 28open displayed higher solution viscosity compared with 28closed [90]. More prominent impact has been reported\n70 2 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers\nby Yagai et al. They synthesized a diarylethene 29 equipped with highly aggregative oligo(p‐phenylenevinylene) (OPV) wings and found that 29open can form π‐ stacked nanoaggregates in MCH to form a gel (Figure 2.17b), whereas 29closed does not form the gel owing to the lack of extended assembly (Figure 2.17a) [91]. Based on a molecular modeling calculation, the authors proposed that the central two methyl groups of the diarylethene core of 29 can work as regulators for aggregation, because they are mobile by the rotation of thiophene rings in the open form, whereas in the closed form they align along the stacking direction (Figure 2.17c–f). This steric effect of the methyl groups should be pronounced if the aggregation is driven by π–π stacking interaction, which requires close contact between the building blocks. While the solution of 29closed can be converted to the gel of 29open by visible‐light irradiation (λ = 600 nm), the gel of 29open cannot be reconverted to the solution upon irradiation with UV light (λ = 313 nm). Because the two thiophene rings of 29open are fixed in a twisted conformation by strong aggregation, ring‐closure reaction might not be allowed.\nA similar observation has been made by Ma et  al. for the supramolecular polymerization of a diarylethene‐introduced benzene‐1,3,5‐tricarboxamide (BTA) that has been extensively cultivated as a scaffold of the supramolecular monomer by Meijer and coworkers [92, 93]. A series of this C3‐symmetrical disk‐ shaped molecule has been shown to self‐assemble into robust one‐dimensional supramolecular structures owing to their high degree of functionalizability [94].\nX X\nX X\nX\nR\nR\nUV\nVis\nClosed-ring isomer Open-ring isomer\nS S\nX\nX X\nX X\nX\nR RS S\nX\nBTA supramolecular monomer 30 bearing three diarylethene units at its peripheral arms has been thus synthesized (Figure 2.18a) [95]. The FT‐IR spectrum of a toluene solution of the open‐ring isomer of 30 (30open) showed the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the amide groups. The fluorescence intensity of 30open in toluene was largely enhanced compared with that in dimethylformamide (DMF) at the same concentration (c  =  1 × 10−4  M), suggesting a fixed molecular arrangement that can restrict molecular motion. Hence, BTA 30open can form a one‐dimensional supramolecular structure through synergistic hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking interactions. SEM visualized crystalline one‐dimensional fibers. The photocylization of 30open with UV‐light irradiation\n(λ = 365 nm) resulted in a low yield of the closed‐ring isomer of the diarylethene units according to the intensity of the new visible absorption band, which can be ascribed to the tight molecular packing of 30open. TEM observation revealed that the supramolecular fibers of 30open with diameters of 15–20 μm could be depolymerized by UV‐light irradiation (λ = 365 nm) for c. 1 hour. This process was photochemically reversible by ring‐opening reaction of the diarylethene units with visible‐light irradiation (λ > 450 nm) of the resulting solution of dissociated 30 (Figure  2.18b). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested that the conformation of 30close bearing three ring‐closed diarylethene units is unfavorable for aggregation compared with 30open due to the steric hindrance of the central methyl groups of the rigidified diarylethene units upon one‐dimensional stacking, which had been originally proposed by Yagai et al. (Figure 2.17). Such an adaptability of diarylethene for extended aggregation is one of the fascinating properties that support utilizing this remarkable photochromic molecule to create photoresponsive supramolecular polymers.\n732.4 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers by Stacking of Photochromic Molecules\nRecently, Ghosh and coworkers reported the phototriggered supramolecular polymerization of naphthalenediimide (NDI) by designing “caged” pro‐ monomer 31 (Figure 2.19) [96]. Compound 31 is protected on its amide site, responsible for aggregation, with an ortho‐nitrobenzyl group that has been also applied for the caged stopper 13 by Meijer and coworkers (Figure 2.6) [51]. Supramolecular monomer 32 self‐assembled upon cooling its hot MCH solutions to 15 °C to form entangled long fibrils as shown by AFM (Figure 2.19b). During cooling, the π–π* absorption band of the NDI chromophores underwent a redshift and the temperature dependence of this redshift followed a sigmoidal transition, indicating the formation of J‐type aggregates via the isodesmic mechanism. On the other hand, any self‐assemblies were not observed for the caged monomer 31, as shown by UV–vis and FT‐IR measurements. When the MCH solution of 31 (c = 1 × 10−3 M) was irradiated with UV light (λ = 254 nm), the ortho‐nitrobenzyl group was quantitatively cleaved to yield active monomer 32, leading to the gelation of the solution. During this phototriggered supramolecular polymerization, the Dh measured by DLS and the solution viscosity gradually increased in line with the conversion of caged 31 to activated 32. AFM images of the photogenerated supramolecular polymers showed spherulite structures (Figure 2.19c–e), which are different from the one‐dimensionally extended fibrillar topology observed for the spontaneous polymerization of 32 (Figure 2.19b). The authors suggested that the phototriggered supramolecular polymerization may occur via an in‐built growth mechanism, which is different from the spontaneous process. In the early stage of the photoelimination reaction of the caged 31, activated 32 could form co‐aggregates with 31 through hydrogen bonds, leading to morphology differences in the growth of supramolecular fibers.\nHirose et al. demonstrated an interesting strategy for control over the degree of supramolecular polymerization by photoswitching active/inactive states of monomers through metal–ligand complexation [97]. For this purpose, they employed symmetrically amide‐functionalized zinc porphyrin 33 bearing chiral aliphatic chains [98] and phenylazopyridine 34 possessing bulky mesityl groups as a Zn‐ligand (Figure 2.20a). The photoresponsive complexation of phenylazopyridine derivatives with metalloporphyrins had been well established by Inoue and coworkers [99] and Otsuki and Narutaki [100]. In a previous paper, Meijer and coworkers disclosed the self‐assembly of 33 as follows [98]. Upon cooling a hot MCH solution of 33 to 20 °C, the Soret absorption band hypsochromically shifted in a nonsigmoidal manner against temperature change, indicating a cooperative self‐assembly process. The self‐assembly of 33 showed a sharp CD signal with a characteristic Cotton effect in the Soret band of porphyrin chromophore, suggesting the helical stacking of porphyrin, which should be supported by amide–amide hydrogen bonding as shown by FT‐IR. AFM imaging visualized well‐defined fibrillar supramolecular polymers of 33 with micrometer lengths. To simulate the photoswitchability of the cooperative self‐assembly of 33 in the presence of 34, they designed a multiple‐equilibrium model using five parameters including equilibrium constants K2 and K in the cooperative process of 33 obtained by fitting the above temperature‐dependent data with a K2–K (dimerization–elongation) model, binding constants of the trans‐ and cis‐ isomer\n76 2 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers\nof 34 (trans‐ and cis‐34) with 33 (Ktrans, Kcis), and the dimerization constant Kd of a porphyrin–pyridine complex 33·34 (Figure 2.20b). The Ktrans and Kcis were determined to be 3.6 × 104 M−1 and 8.1 × 103 M−1, respectively, by the titration experiment of N‐methylated derivative Me‐33 with trans‐34 (97% at PSStrans) and successive UV irradiation (λ = 360 nm) into cis‐34 (95% at PSScis). For Kd, the value of 33·pyridine was used because the dimerization process of 33 is independent of the ligand type. The simulation with the cooperative model in the presence of 40 equiv. of 34 predicted larger porphyrin stacks of 3100 monomers at PSScis while only 2% of short porphyrin stacks was predicted at PSStrans. Conversely, simulation with the isodesmic model resulted in a less photoinduced switchability of degree of polymerization, and porphyrin stacks of 22 monomers were estimated at PSScis. Taking into consideration the above simulation and the result of the titration experiment of 33 with trans‐34 as well as insufficient photoisomerization of 34 in the presence of porphyrins, they prepared an MCH solution of 33 containing 54 equiv. of trans‐34. When this solution was UV irradiated, trans‐34:cis‐34 = 10 : 90 was achieved at PSScis, and the growth of the Soret band and the CD signal suggesting the supramolecular polymerization of 33 was observed. The subsequent irradiation of the cis‐rich solution with visible light (λ = 420 nm) converted cis‐34 to trans‐34, which again disassociated supramolecular polymers of 33. The fraction of stacked porphyrin monomers increased significantly from 1% at PSStrans to 81% at PSScis, which is in good agreement with the simulated results (Figure  2.20b). These photoinduced depolymerization/repolymerization processes resulted in a change in viscosity from 0.637 to 0.704 cP for 4.0 × 10−5 M MCH solution of 33 upon trans‐to‐cis isomerization of 34 (c = 1.88 mM)."

      "text" : "The photoisomerization of supramolecular monomers without breaking noncovalent interactions (without monomer exchange) is one of the challenging but intriguing research topics, because this could realize a topological control of supramolecular main chains. The topological control of one‐dimensional polymer chain is a key to induce a specific property beyond the functionality of monomer building blocks, as shown by the diverse topological features of proteins. To realize this, sufficiently strong intermolecular interactions are required between supramolecular monomers because their structural changes upon photoisomerization could cause significant changes in enthalpy and entropy associated with self‐assembly.\nIn this chapter, we focus on supramolecular polymers whose one‐ dimensional topology can be transformed by light stimuli in such a manner. In general, functions of naturally occurring and synthetic polymers are dominated not only by  the property of the monomer units but also by the topology of their one‐ dimensional chains. Photochromic molecules serve as an essential trigger in many important biological photoreceptors that can exhibit conformational changes. For instance, channel rhodopsins, the light‐gated cation channels, show\n772.5 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers with Photocontrollable 1D Topology\na conformational transformation of one state to the other in response to light, finally leading to physiological responses such as opening/closing ion channels [101, 102]. Therefore, photocontrol over the topology of one‐dimensional supramolecular polymer chains is a fascinating and challenging research topic that paves the way for the creation of supramolecular polymers with dynamically controllable functions.\nThe research group of Stupp and coworkers has introduced photoresponsive units into their peptide amphiphile systems. For instance, they exploited a photoelimination reaction that triggered the untangling of supramolecular quadruple helical fibers composed of a peptide amphiphile 35 bearing a pentadecanyl chain (Figure 2.21) [103]. The photocleavable ortho‐nitrobenzyl group was introduced as a bulky substituent into the N‐terminal amide position of 35 (Figure 2.21a). Upon cooling a hot aqueous solution (pH 11) of 35 to 25 °C, the formation of quadruple helical fibers was observed by TEM (Figure  2.21b,c, arrow I). A closer inspection of the TEM image revealed that the entangled helix is formed by two smaller double helical fibers (arrows II), which are further composed of two nonhelical, cylindrical elementary fibrils (arrows III). The untangled double helical fibers and elementary fibrils were intertwined again with the neighboring supramolecular strands (Figure 2.21b, arrow IV). The elementary fibrils had a diameter of 11 nm, which was approximately twice as large as the calculated length of 35 (5.6 nm). The widths and pitches were 33 ±  2 nm and 92 ± 4 nm, respectively, for the quadruple helices, and 24 ± 1 nm and 106 ± 3 nm, respectively, for the double helices. In addition, both helices had right‐handed helical structures. FT‐IR studies revealed that the self‐assembly of 35 is driven by β‐sheet formation through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between the amphiphilic chains (Figure 2.21c). The self‐assembly of 35 resulted in sharp CD signals in the absorption region of the ortho‐nitrobenzyl moiety, suggesting that the steric repulsion between the bulky substituents may induce higher order helical twisting. Accordingly, the irradiation of the aqueous solution of 35 with UV light (λ = 350 nm) for five minutes converted these higher order helical fibers into the elementary cylindrical fibrils with a diameter of 11 nm, which was demonstrated by TEM observation (Figure  2.21d,e). MALDI‐TOF MS and UV–vis analyses revealed that the ortho‐nitrobenzyl moiety was photoeliminated in c. 97% yield, thus producing deprotected amphiphile 36, which did not induce higher order helical architecture due to lack of the bulky substituent.\nSimilar photoinduced untangling of helically intertwined supramolecular polymers into linear fibrils has been reported by Yagai et al. (Figure 2.22) [104]. They designed a diarylethene derivative 37 bearing two monotopic melamine units and a ditopic cyanurate‐appended oligothiophene 38 (Figure 2.22a). The aggregation of these complementary components via CMHB interactions could lead to the formation of an ABAB type supramolecular copolymer (37·38)n (Figure 2.22b). The complexation between the open‐form isomer of 37 (37open) and 38 at 1 : 1 stoichiometry was confirmed by UV–vis titration experiments in cyclohexane, wherein the oligothiophene moiety of 38 quantitatively formed H‐type aggregates upon addition of 37open. At millimolar concentrations, gelation of cyclohexane was observed, suggesting the formation of elongated supramolecular polymers of (37open·38)n (Figure  2.22d, left). TEM and AFM observations\n80 2 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers\nvisualized thick helical fibers with widths of c. 20 nm (Figure 2.22c, left). Upon UV‐light irradiation (λ  =  313 nm) of the solution of (37open·38)n, ring‐closing reaction of 37open occurred and induced a structural transition of thick helical fibers into thin fibrils at a PSS (37open:37closed  =  13 : 87), as shown by TEM (Figure 2.22c, right). For the gel, this nanostructural transition induced a gel‐to‐ sol transition (Figure 2.22d, right). The original helical nanofibers were regenerated by visible‐light irradiation (λ = 602 nm) of the UV‐irradiated solution. This unique nanostructural transition could be attributed to the change in molecular rigidity of the diarylethene moiety upon the ring‐closing reaction. The supramolecular copolymers (37open·38)n would be flexible due to the twistable conformation of 37open, allowing the primary chains to further organize into higher order helical structures with folding and intertwining through the interchain π–π stacking between the pendent oligothiophene units of 38. On the other hand, due to a conformational stiffness of 37closed, supramolecular copolymers (37closed·38)n are unable to further organize into higher order structures, and exist as the primary structure.\nIn another example by Stupp and coworkers, photoresponsive supramolecular polymers have been constructed from a tripeptide amphiphile 39 bearing an azobenzene unit at one terminus (Figure 2.23a) [105]. In this system, the helical pitch of the superhelical nanostructure could be controlled by light. Amphiphile 39, when the azobenzene unit was the trans‐isomer (trans‐39), self‐assembled in cyclohexyl chloride to form superhelical nanofibers that were well visualized by AFM (Figure 2.23b). The superhelical nanofibers had a uniform helical pitch of 78 nm (Figure 2.23c,d). According to the mechanism proposed by the authors, trans‐39 first forms a “primary” helix, which further twists due to the torsional strain generated by steric repulsion between the bulky end groups (i.e. trans‐ azobenzene moieties). In other words, the bulky trans‐azobenzene moieties at the peripheries can be accommodated by helical twisting. Interestingly, UV‐light irradiation (λ = 360 nm) of the helical nanofibers in cyclohexyl chloride caused a decrease in helical pitches to 40–70 nm (Figure 2.23e–g). The photogenerated cis‐39 whose conformation was less planar (sterically bulky) compared with the trans‐conformer could induce the torsional strain, resulting in a reduction of the helical pitch. The resulting helical pitches varied from nanofiber to nanofiber, which arises from the inhomogeneity of the trans‐to‐cis isomerization efficiency of trans‐39 among nanofibers. Conversely, the helical pitch is uniform within each superhelix, indicating that the photoresponsive decrease of the helical pitches undergoes a relaxation process throughout the entire nanostructure.\nRecently, an outstanding topological control of one‐dimensional supramolecular polymer chains has been accomplished by Yagai and coworkers [106] using barbiturated naphthalene–azobenzene hybrid molecule 40 (Figure 2.24a). They had previously found that a 2,6‐substituted naphthalene molecule 41 equipped with barbituric acid and aliphatic wedge self‐assembles via the formation of a hydrogen‐bonded rosette into toroidal nanostructures with a uniform diameter of c. 20 nm (Figure  2.24b,d,f ) [83, 107]. The size uniformity of the toroidal nanostructures established that naphthalene‐functionalized barbituric acid rosettes can continuously stack to generate spontaneous (uniform) curvature due to idiosyncratic internal order along the π‐stacked rosettes (Figure 2.24f ).\n832.6 Summary and Outlook\nThe additional azobenzene π‐surface could strengthen the aggregation capability of the rosette, by which two important outcomes have been induced. First, the increased association force between rosettes prevented the growing supramolecular polymer chains from closing into discrete shorter assemblies, and instead yielded extended curved supramolecular polymers. Second, the strengthened rosette–rosette interactions allowed a direct deformation of columnar aggregates (supramolecular polymer chains) upon photoisomerization of the azobenzene moiety without monomer exchange (Figure 2.24c,e). When a hot MCH or CHCl3–MCH mixed solution of trans‐40 was cooled to 20 °C with various cooling rates, well‐defined nanofibers that ranged from randomly folded to helically folded supramolecular polymers were confirmed by AFM and TEM (Figure  2.24g). Upon UV‐light irradiation (λ  =  365 nm) of the solutions of trans‐40, these helical supramolecular polymer fibers (SPhelical) transformed into extended and unfolded fibers (SPlinear) via a randomly folded structure (SPrandom) (Figure 2.23g–i), indicating that photogenerated cis‐isomer‐containing rosette destroys the spontaneous curvature. Small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS) analysis also showed a similar result, which indicates the deletion of spontaneous curvature upon UV irradiation. Subsequent visible‐light irradiation (λ  =  470 nm) that causes the cis‐to‐trans isomerization of cis‐40 allowed the extended fibers to refold up to the level of the randomly folded structure (Figure  2.24j). This topological transformation of supramolecular polymer fibers demonstrates that the photoinduced deformation of the folded structure of 40 can regulate the internal order of main chains by the deletion/recovery of spontaneous curvature, leading to control over higher order secondary conformation. Notably, mixing of two solutions exclusively containing folded and extended supramolecular polymers did not show any merging of these fiber morphologies, and each original fiber morphology has been confirmed upon aging for days. Based on this finding, the authors concluded that the photoisomerization of 40 proceeds within the supramolecular polymer fibers, and their unfolding/refolding undoubtedly occurs without aggregate–monomer exchange. As the observed photoinduced unfolding and refolding of supramolecular polymers is reminiscent of the protein unfolding/folding process, the authors expect that this study could advance the frontiers of supramolecular polymers toward applications by mimicking the functionality of biopolymers."

      "text" : "Without any doubt, supramolecular polymers cannot hold a candle to covalent polymers in terms of bulk physical properties due to the reversible nature of main chains. However, such a weak point can turn into an exceptionally attractive property when one can successfully impart controllability in bond breakage and formation by using external stimuli. Thus, the implementation of host–guest recognition sites, complementary hydrogen‐bonding sites, extended π‐stacking moieties, and other noncovalent interacting sites to photoreactive units has been addressed by many supramolecular chemists to engineer a variety of supramolecular polymers exhibiting different types of photoresponse. Although the most\n84 2 Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers\nwidely used photoreactive unit is azobenzene, similarly to other photoresponsive research fields, diarylethene as a molecular switch, stilbene as a photodimerizable unit, and ortho‐nitrobenzyl group as a photoelimination group have been successfully coupled with various supramolecular polymer systems.\nFrom the viewpoint of supramolecular polymer backbones, a relatively unexplored system is one‐dimensional columnar structures formed from discotic molecules or supramolecules with extended π‐surface. Such π‐surface is available through the synthesis of C3‐symmetrical disk‐shaped molecules (e.g. BTA) and multicomponent rosette‐shaped supermacrocycles (e.g. barbiturated π‐ conjugated molecule). By introducing photoreactive units at the core or peripheries of these discotic building blocks, we would obtain fascinating photoresponsive supramolecular polymers that can control not only the polymerization/ depolymerization but also their one‐dimensional topologies without depolymerization. We believe that the latter approach sheds light on new responsiveness and the resulting functionality in supramolecular polymer chemistry."

      "text" : "Bottom‐up fabrication of functional nanostructures and molecular devices from self‐assembling soft materials with tailored photonic properties is currently a burgeoning area of research. The liquid crystals (LCs) capable of forming self‐ organized, tunable one‐dimensional (1D) or three‐dimensional (3D) photonic nanostructures represent such an elegant system because of their unique ability to control the propagation of light by various external stimuli [1–8]. Light‐driven chiral molecular switches or motors in liquid crystalline media are of fundamental academic interest and technological significance since they could not only bring a new generation of multifunctional supramolecular 1D and 3D photonic materials with unprecedented properties but also exploit the benefits of light stimuli such as the ease of spatial, temporal, and remote control of the irradiation under ambient conditions [9–11]. These photoactive functional soft materials can be facilely fabricated from achiral liquid crystalline hosts by adding appropriate amount of a light‐driven chiral molecular switch or motor, and they have found many potential applications in color filters, polarizers, all‐optical displays, optical lasers, sensors, energy‐saving smart devices, and so on. Fundamentally, the photoresponsiveness of these supramolecular soft materials is a result of both molecular interaction and geometry changes in the chiral molecular switch or motor upon light irradiation, and one of their key features is the existence of a photonic bandgap (PBG) in the range of the wavelength of visible light, which sometimes extents to the near infrared (NIR) region and beyond. This PBG is analogous to the energy bandgap in the semiconductors and can exist in 1D cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs), or 3D periodic superstructures such as blue phases (BPs), LC microdroplets, and microshells, depending on the number of directions in which the periodicity exists.\nThe ability of a chiral molecular switch or motor to impart a twist to an achiral LC host is usually quantified in terms of the helical twisting power (HTP), β, which is expressed by the equation β = 1/(pc), where c is the molar or weight concentration\nLight‐Driven Self‐Organized Liquid Crystalline Nanostructures Enabled by Chiral Molecular Switches or Motors: From 1D to 3D Photonic Crystals Ling Wang and Quan Li\nKent State University, Liquid Crystal Institute and Chemical Physics Interdisciplinary Program, 1425 Lefton Esplanade, Kent, OH 44242, USA\n92 3 Light‐Driven Self‐Organized Liquid Crystalline Nanostructures Enabled\nof the chiral switch and p is the helical pitch of the LC. Photo isomerization of the chiral switch results in  the changes of the molecular conformation and HTP, which may lead to a change in the pitch or handedness of the chiral LCs [12–17]. One of critical challenges in this endeavor is the design and synthesis of light‐ driven chiral molecular switches with high HTP values that display large differences in HTP at their different isomeric states. High HTP values reduce the necessary concentrations of the chiral dopants, while large differences in HTP of the chiral dopants enable wide‐range pitch tunability of the photoresponsive chiral LCs. Therefore, light‐driven chiral molecular switches or motors based on diverse photoresponsive moieties have been developed to fabricate chiral liquid crystalline superstructures with superior photonic properties. Typical photoresponsive moieties include azobenzenes, dithienylethenes, spiropyrans, and their photoisomerization processes are illustrated in Figure  3.1. Azobenzenes could experience trans–cis isomerization under UV irradiation, and the cis isomer would be driven back to its trans form either by visible light or thermal relaxation [18]. Diarylethenes can transform from the colorless ring‐open state to the colored ring‐closed state under UV irradiation. The reverse process is thermally stable and can be only driven by visible‐light irradiations [19]. For spiropyrans, UV irradiation leads to the photochemical cleavage of C─O bond and the transformation from the initial colorless state to the colored merocyanine [20]. When the UV source is removed, they can thermally relax back to colorless initial states quickly. It should be noted that the large change in polarity and charge distribution could be obtained upon photoisomerization between the spiropyran state and the merocyanine state. The aim of this chapter is to highlight the current achievements in the field of light‐driven self‐organized liquid crystalline nanostructures enabled by chiral molecular switches or motors. Toward this end, we first introduce the recent advances in the development of light‐driven CLCs with 1D helical\n933.2 Light‐Driven Cholesteric Liquid Crystals\nsuperstructures by loading different photoresponsive chiral molecular switches or motors including chiral azobenzene, chiral dithienylethene, chiral spirooxazine, and overcrowded alkenes. Then, we move to a discussion of light‐driven BP LCs with 3D cubic nanostructures. We also address the recent endeavor in developing the light‐driven chiral liquid crystalline microdroplets and microshells. The last section of this chapter (Section 3.5) provides a perspective for the future scope of these emerging photoactive chiral liquid crystalline nanostructured materials. It should be noted that this chapter does not aim at including all accomplishments in this research field but rather points to important developments by introducing representative examples from different topics."

      "text" : "Cholesteric phase, i.e. chiral nematic phase, is a variant of the nematic, which spontaneously forms a macroscopic helical structure either when the LC molecules are inherently chiral or when chirality is externally introduced [21–27]. The presence of chirality causes the director profile to assume a twisted configuration throughout the medium. In the cholesteric superstructures, the LC molecules exhibit the spatial orientation in a helical manner along the helical axis, where the helical superstructures are typically characterized by handedness and helical pitch. Handedness describes the direction in which the molecular orientation rotates along the helical axis, while the pitch (p) is the distance over which the director rotates a full 360°. According to Bragg’s law, the cholesteric superstructure with homogeneous alignment could selectively reflect circularly polarized light (CPL) with the same handedness as its helix. The reflection wavelength (λ) is typically determined by λ = np, where n is the average refraction index of LCs. Many efforts have been made to fabricate a light‐ driven helical superstructure with tunable pitches by doping light‐driven chiral molecular switches with superior properties into achiral LC media. For example, the pitch of cholesteric superstructures becomes smaller upon light irradiations at appropriate wavelength, which enables the dynamic reflection color tuning from blue, green, to red and vice versa under light exposures at different wavelengths (Figure 3.2a) [28]. Furthermore, light‐driven dynamic handedness inversion of cholesteric superstructures has been obtained by doping unique light‐driven chiral molecular switches or motors into achiral LC media. Upon alternating UV‐ and visible‐light irradiations, the cholesteric helix of one handedness unwinds, and disappears at a critical point with infinite pitch, and then rewinds through self‐organizing into another helix of the opposite twist sense (Figure 3.2b) [29]."

      "text" : "Upon light irradiations at appropriate wavelength, azobenzene‐based molecular  switches are known to exhibit reversible trans–cis isomerization, in which large conformational and polarization changes are often observed. The trans form of azobenzene exhibiting a rod‐like structure can stabilize the LC superstructure,\nwhereas its cis form exhibiting a bent-shaped structure destabilizes the LC superstructure. As a result of the dramatic difference in molecular geometry of the trans and cis forms, the HTPs of these geometric isomers are different, which in turn enables optical tuning of the cholesteric pitch and hence the PBG. In 1971, Sackmann reported the photochemically induced reversible color changes in photoresponsive CLCs prepared by doping azobenzene molecules into a non‐halide‐ based cholesteryl mixture [30]. The PBG reflection of the CLC mixture blue‐shifted from 610 to 560 nm upon irradiation with 420 nm light. Although the tuning range is quite narrow, this work is the first demonstration of reversible phototuning of cholesteric reflection colors, providing a pathway to the photoresponsive CLCs. In general, the HTP of the chiral molecular  switch in a CLC mixture depends on its structure of the molecules, the nature of the chirality, and the interaction with host molecules. To date, various azobenzene derivatives have been reported for this purpose, such as chiral mesogens doped with achiral azobenzene molecules, pure photoresponsive chiral mesogens, and nematic LC doped\n953.2 Light‐Driven Cholesteric Liquid Crystals\nwith  photoresponsive chiral dopants [31–38]. Recently, the studies are mainly focused on the design and synthesis of powerful chiral azobenzenes that exhibit high HTPs as well as large HTP variations upon light irradiation.\nKurihara and coworkers synthesized a series of isosorbide‐ or isomannide‐ based chiral photochromic compounds with plural azobenzene groups, and the resulting azobenzene photoswitches exhibited high HTPs as well as large HTP variations upon light irradiation [34]. Gottarelli and coworkers introduced the photoresponsive chiral azobenzene based on the binaphthyl derivatives with axial chirality, where the unique combination of binaphthyl with azobenzene units was expected to generate a family of axially chiral azobenzene photoswitches with high HTPs [39, 40]. Li et al. have developed a series of binaphthyl‐ derived axially chiral azobenzene compounds [41–46]. These chiral switches have superior solubility in LC hosts and exhibit high HTP values and considerable differences in HTP among their various states, and they were all found to be capable of phototuning the reflection color across the full visible spectrum. Some of these compounds have been employed in the fabrication of chiral photodisplays, which do not require the driving electronics usually used in conventional electro‐optic LC displays. Absence of the driving electronics drastically brings down the cost of such displays and makes them lightweight [47, 48].\nSome breakthroughs have been made when the binaphthyl‐derived axially chiral azobenzene was functionalized with rod‐like moieties, where the rod‐like units in these chiral dopants resemble the molecular structure of nematic hosts made of rod‐shaped molecules. It should be noted that these compounds displayed greater compatibility with the nematic hosts and exhibited exceptionally high HTP values. For example, a light‐driven chiral molecular photoswitch as shown in Figure 3.3a was found to exhibit high HTPs and superior solubility in achiral LC hosts, which could be used to develop an optically tunable helical superstructure capable of fast and reversible phototuning of the structural reflection across the entire visible region [49]. To be specific, a mixture of 6.5 wt% chiral photoswitch in nematic LC E7 was capillary filled into a 5‐μm thick glass cell with a polyimide planar alignment layer and the cell was painted black on one side. The reflection wavelength of the cell could be tuned starting from the UV region across the entire visible region to the NIR region upon UV irradiation at 365 nm (5.0 mW cm−2) within approximately 50 seconds, whereas its reversible process starting from the NIR region across the entire visible region to the UV region was achieved by visible light at 520 nm (1.5 mW cm−2) or dark thermal relaxation. The reflection colors across the entire visible region were uniform and brilliant as shown in Figure 3.3b,c. The reversible phototuning process was repeated many times without degradation. It is worth noting that the reversible phototuning process across the entire visible region can be achieved in seconds with the increase of light intensity. Furthermore, this chiral switch was used in a photo‐addressed colored LC display driven by light and hidden as well as fixed by the application of an electric field from thermal degradation. As illustrated in Figure 3.3d, the reflective image can be hidden in focal conic texture by applying a 30 V pulse and revealed by applying a 60 V pulse. Moreover, by applying a 30 V pulse to an optically written image so as to make the UV irradiated region going to the focal conic texture and the UV un‐irradiated region going to the planar\n973.2 Light‐Driven Cholesteric Liquid Crystals\ntexture, an optically written image can be stored indefinitely because the planar and focal conic textures are stable even though the light‐driven chiral switch relaxes to the un‐irradiated state. It should be noted that wide‐range nonmechanical beam steering has been demonstrated by using CLCs with such rod‐like molecule‐functionalized axially chiral azobenzene [50]. More recently, we reported the first example of a novel halogen‐bonded light‐driven axially chiral molecular switch, where pyridyl‐substituted binaphthyl azobenzene served as a halogen‐bond acceptor and the 4‐iodotetrafluorophenyl derivative as a halogen‐ bond donor [51]. This chiral molecular switch was found to exhibit both optical and thermal sensitivity, which enabled red, green, blue (RGB) reflection colors by different light irradiations or by temperature control. This study provides valuable knowledge on the rational design of efficient light‐driven switches or motors for amplification and modulation of chirality in dynamic functional soft matter and nanosystems.\nLi and coworkers have achieved reversible visible‐light‐driven dynamic tuning of RGB reflection colors in CLCs by designing a novel light‐driven chiral azobenzene molecular switch with extended conjugation [52]. Wang et al. looked toward the possibility of dynamic reflection tuning of cholesteric superstructures by remote NIR irradiation (Figure  3.4) [53]. The upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are known to emit UV and visible light upon NIR exposures [54, 55]. A unique core–shell UCNPs was designed and synthesized, where the intensity ratio of its emissions at different wavelengths was highly dependent on the excitation power density of the NIR irradiation. Then they developed a novel chiral azobenzene photoswitch whose UV and visible absorptions exhibit significant\n98 3 Light‐Driven Self‐Organized Liquid Crystalline Nanostructures Enabled\noverlap with the emissions of the UCNPs. The photoresponsive CLCs were formulated by mixing the azobenzene photoswitch and the UCNPs with an achiral liquid crystalline host composed of commercially available components. The resulting nanoparticle impregnated cholesteric superstructure exhibited reversibly tunable RGB reflections by simply changing the power density of the NIR irradiation at 980 nm. The reflection wavelength of such a cholesteric hybrid superstructure redshifted upon NIR irradiation at high power density, whereas the reverse process occurred upon irradiation at lower power density. Such UCNP‐assisted photochemistry shall provide important insights into the future fabrication of NIR‐photoactive advanced soft materials.\nYu and coworkers demonstrated piecewise RGB reflection tuning of CLCs by developing a photoresponsive tristable chiral molecular switch [56]. The tristable chiral switch was constructed by incorporating two different photoresponsive azobenzene switches, i.e. parent azobenzene (Azo) and o‐fluoroazobenzene (F‐Azo), into one binaphthyl‐derived chiral structure with high HTP (Figure 3.5a). It should be noted that trans–cis isomerization of F‐Azo can be achieved by the irradiations with both UV light and visible light due to the good separation of the n–π* bands of trans and cis isomers. The resulting light‐driven tristable chiral switch was found to exhibit three different photostationary configurations, i.e. configuration I (trans, trans, trans, trans) upon irradiation with 470 nm light, configuration II (cis, trans, trans, cis) upon irradiation with 530 nm light, and configuration III (cis, cis, cis, cis) upon irradiation with 365 nm light as shown in Figure 3.5b. The CLCs loaded with the tristable chiral switch showed two tuning periods of cholesteric reflection upon appropriate light irradiations, i.e. one period tuned in the visible spectrum and another period in the NIR region (Figure 3.5c). To be specific, upon light irradiation at 470 and 530 nm, the CLCs show dynamic selective reflection in the visible spectrum covering the three primary RGB colors, whereas wide reflection tuning in the NIR region was achieved under irradiation with 530 and 365 nm light. Moreover, photoaddressable images of dynamic RGB colors with black background were further demonstrated based on this mechanism (Figure 3.5d).\nLight‐driven dynamic handedness inversion of CLCs has attracted increasing attention due to its fundamental significance and the advantages of remote, spatial, and temporal controllability. One can achieve light‐driven dynamic handedness inversion through opposite‐handed doping of powerful photoresponsive chiral switch and photoinsensitive chiral molecules into achiral LCs [57–60]. This method can eliminate the need for complicated molecular design of chiral switches, but handedness inversion often occurs in infrared regions due to the limited solubility of photoresponsive chiral switch and poor miscibility between two dopants. Many strategies have been developed for the rational molecular design of single chiral molecular photoswitches that could confer handedness inversion capability to CLCs, but the event of light‐driven handedness inversion using such methodology is often encountered by chance. Mathews et al. found that light‐driven reversible handedness inversion of CLCs could be achieved by judiciously designing and synthesizing a chiral cyclic azobenzene photoswitch based on axially chiral binaphthyl derivatives [61]. Recently, Li et  al. further reported a novel design strategy based on the chiral conflict and equilibrium\nshifting between multiple chiral moieties in a single molecule [62]. These molecular engineered chiral switches were found to confer handedness inversion in different LC hosts upon light irradiation with moderate to high HTPs, where the chirality of each chiral moiety does not need to be reversed. Since the R and S configuration of unbridged binaphthyls normally will induce right‐ handed and left‐handed CLCs, the design strategy is to incorporate multiple chiral binaphthyls with opposite chirality into a single molecule functionalized with photoresponsive groups, and helix inversion was thus achieved based on the chiral conflict and equilibrium shift between these chiral moieties. Using the same principle, Guo and coworkers demonstrated light‐directed dynamic handedness inversion of CLCs by developing intermolecular hydrogen‐bonded chiral azoarenes containing binaphthyl units of opposite chiral\n100 3 Light‐Driven Self‐Organized Liquid Crystalline Nanostructures Enabled\nconfiguration [63]. This principle should be applied to other photoresponsive systems toward dynamic chirality inversion capability."

      "text" : "Compared with chiral azobenzene photoswitches, chiral diarylethenes possess the advantage of thermal irreversibility in both the open‐ and closed‐ring isomeric states. However, only a few derivatives of diarylethenes have been reported as chiral molecular dopants with applications as liquid crystalline phase switches [64–66]. Most of the reported chiral diarylethenes exhibit low to moderate HTPs and are not suitable for reflection wavelength tuning. These relatively low HTPs also give rise to the requirement of higher doping concentrations, which often leads to phase separation, coloration, and physical property changes of the LC host. Therefore, it would be of great practical interest to develop chiral diarylethenes with high HTPs as well as large HTP variations upon light irradiation. It was not until recently that we reported some chiral diarylethene switches for wide range reflection color tuning. Li et al. reported the first diarylethene switch with axial chirality, high HTPs, and large HTP variations upon light irradiation for wide‐range reflection color tuning (Figure 3.6a) [67]. When doping 0.4 wt% of the dithienylethene photoswitch into the achiral LC host, an achiral LC phase was initially obtained but would transform into the cholesteric upon UV irradiation and vice versa. A higher doping concentration of 7.7 wt% was used for phototuning of the RGB reflection colors of CLC mixtures (Figure  3.6b). The reflection central wavelength of this mixture was around 630 nm at the initial state. Upon UV irradiation, its reflection wavelength was tuned to 530 nm within 10 seconds and further reached a photostationary state in 25 seconds with a reflection central wavelength at 440 nm (Figure 3.6c). This photoinduced state was thermally stable and could be photochemically switched back to a nearly initial state by visible‐light irradiation at 550 nm within two minutes. Furthermore, the three primary RGB colors were simultaneously demonstrated in a single thin film by varying UV irradiation times and photomasking at different areas.\nBinaphthyl‐derived chiral  diarylethene switches, i.e. dithienylcyclopentenes, were also demonstrated to enable light‐driven dynamic handedness inversion of CLCs with excellent thermal bistability and excellent fatigue resistance [68, 69]. It is believed that the reversible handedness inversion in these systems originated from the conformation change of binaphthyl moieties as well as the stereospecific intermolecular interactions between the binaphthyl moieties and the surrounding nematic LC molecules. Recently, Wang et al. achieved NIR‐light‐driven dynamic handedness inversion of CLCs by designing and synthesizing a novel category of core–multishell UCNPs and a binaphthyl‐derived diarylethene chiral photoswitch (Figure 3.7) [70]. The UCNPs acting as the NIR nanotransducers are composed of dual lanthanide upconverting activators, i.e. Tm3+ and Er3+ in separate layers, where the Tm3+ and Nd3+ ions were bridged by an array of Yb3+ ions, and the Er3+ ions were separated by an optically inert interlayer. The core– multishell nanotransducers were found to exhibit UV and visible luminescence on demand from the individual UCNPs by selective excitation with NIR light at two different wavelengths of 808 and 980 nm. Interestingly, the UV and visible\nluminescences from the nanotransducers were able to drive reversible photocyclization of the chiral diarylethene molecular switch due to the synergetic interaction between the switch and the nanotransducers. The CLCs loaded with such chiral diarylethene photoswitch and UCNP nanotransducers exhibited reversible handedness inversion upon irradiations with NIR light of different wavelengths. Furthermore, Wang et  al. also reported NIR‐light‐directed dynamic\nreflection of both left‐ and right‐handed CPL through the visible range spanning the RGB wavelengths by developing novel CLCs loaded with mesogen‐modified gold nanorods (GNRs) [71]. These studies provide significant impetus toward the development and realization of light‐driven functional soft materials for promising photonic applications where CPL is involved.\nRecently, Zheng et al. reported the breakthrough of light‐driven 3D control of the helical axis in cholesteric superstructures by using the same chiral diarylethene photoswitch [72]. Upon continuous irradiation with UV light, the standing helix transformed to a lying state and the lying helix rotated in the plane of the LC cell until the system reached its photostationary state (Figure 3.8). The system can be driven back in the opposite direction by visible‐light irradiation. Facile 3D control over the helical axis of the cholesteric superstructures has also been utilized in a specially engineered bilayer LC cell to obtain 2D diffraction gratings. Interestingly, reversible transformation between 2D to 1D and 1D to zero‐dimensional (off state) diffraction states has been achieved under alternating UV‐ and visible‐light irradiations. The helical\naxis of cholesteric superstructures could be controlled by surface alignments or by applying external voltage, which builds the foundation for their practical application such as reflective displays, thermography, mirrorless lasing, and tunable color filters [73–79]. This work is a step toward the realization of complex, light‐activated smart systems and dynamic, reconfigurable 3D architectures through dynamic, remote, and continuous control over the helical axis in 3D space.\n104 3 Light‐Driven Self‐Organized Liquid Crystalline Nanostructures Enabled\nFigure 3.9 (a) Unidirectional rotation of molecular overcrowded alkene motor in a liquid crystalline host, and associated HTPs.

      "text" : "Spirooxazines are an interesting family of photochromic materials due to their unique properties such as excellent photofatigue resistance, strong photocoloration, and fast thermal relaxation. The fatigue resistance of spirooxazines has led to their successful use in various applications including commercialized eyewear. Since the spiro‐carbon of a spirooxazine molecule has potential as a chiral center, spirooxazines could be used as chiroptical molecular switches. However, spirooxazines usually exist as racemates. Even if the enantiomers are separated, each enantiomer is racemized by thermal and optical interconversions. Therefore, if the spirooxazines are utilized as chiroptical molecules in achiral nematic LC systems, modification of the spirooxazine with a chiral group is required. Accordingly, Jin et  al. synthesized a series of binaphthyl‐ derived axially chiral spirooxazines [80, 81]. Light‐driven cholesteric superstructures with fast thermal relaxation have been demonstrated by using such chiral spirooxazines. However, much effort is still needed to achieve the chiral spirooxazine photoswitches that exhibit high HTPs as well as large HTP variations upon light irradiation.\nIn addition to chiral azobenzene, diarylethene, and spirooxazine, chiral overcrowded alkenes have also been intensively studied. Feringa et al. pioneered the sterically overcrowded alkenes with intrinsic helical conformations, which are able to induce handedness inversion of the cholesteric helix when used as chiral dopants [82–87]. These types of molecules are also found to be capable of tuning the reflection colors in CLCs. Take the light‐driven chiral motor in Figure 3.9a as an example [90]. Its initial HTP at (P, P)‐trans form in nematic E7 is +99 μm−1, but generation of a cholesteric helix with an opposite sign of similar pitch is impossible, as the (M, M)‐trans form possesses a minor negative HTP (βM = −7 μm−1, E7). As a result of the high HTP at (P, P)‐trans form, colored LC films were easily generated using this dopant. Photochemical and thermal isomerizations of the motor lead to irreversible color change in the LC film as shown in Figure 3.9b [88]. Interestingly, remarkable stripe rotations were observed in an open film of a photoresponsive CLC with this chiral overcrowded alkene placed on a glass substrate treated with a unidirectional alignment layer, and the collective action of overcrowded‐alkene‐based molecular motors embedded in the cholesteric matrix has been harnessed to controllably rotate microparticles with remote light\n1053.2 Light‐Driven Cholesteric Liquid Crystals\n> 280 nm\n> 380 nm\nUnstable (M,M)-cis\nUnstable (M,M)-trans βM = –7 μm–1 (E7)\nStable (P,P)-trans βM = +99 μm–1 (E7)\nStable (P,P)-cis βM = +17 μm–1 (E7)\n20 °C60 °C\n> 280 nm\n> 380 nm\nRotor\nAxle\nStator\n24 nm\n0 nm\n(a)\n(c)\n(b)\n106 3 Light‐Driven Self‐Organized Liquid Crystalline Nanostructures Enabled\nas the fuel (Figure 3.9c) [89, 91, 92].

      "text" : "Liquid crystalline BPs are among the most interesting self‐organized superstructures in the field of LCs, which are known to self‐organize into 3D periodic cubic nanostructures [95–97]. This phase usually exists only over a narrow temperature range before the CLCs clear to the isotropic liquid. Similar to CLCs, BPs can be observed either in pure chiral mesogens or can be induced from achiral LCs by adding chiral dopants. The cubic nanostructures are characterized by the double twist cylinders (DTCs) that are stabilized by disclinations. Normally, when chirality in the LC system is high enough, DTCs are more stable than a simple twist structure. However, DTCs cannot be densely packed to fill the entire space and disclination lines appear at the interstices among the cylinders to form a stabilized 3D cubic structure [98–109]. There are three types of BPs reported, namely, BPIII, BPII, and BPI, which are usually observed during cooling from the isotropic to the cholesteric phase in the order of decreasing temperature. BPI and BPII have body‐centered cubic and simple cubic structures, respectively, while BPIII is amorphous in nature. BPI and BPII are periodic in three dimensions and the periodicity is typically on the order of the wavelength of visible light. These nanostructures enable BPs to reflect light in the visible region and have been recognized as promising soft self‐assembled 3D photonic crystals in recent years [110–112].\nLight‐driven self‐organized BP 3D cubic nanostructures that display distinctive photonic reflection in the three orthogonal directions have received increasing attention, especially in recent years, but the reflection wavelength tuning is usually quite narrow [113–115]. The ability to dynamically tune the PBG in cubic BPs across a wide wavelength range is highly desirable, but it has not been realized due to various obstacles including the instability and irreversibility of BPs under the light irradiations. Li and coworkers made a breakthrough of phototuning full visible range reflection in BPs by using an axially chiral azobenzene photoswitch as shown in Figure 3.10a,b [116]. The initial phase of the doped BPs was the BPII with (100) lattice confirmed by the Kossel diagram as shown in Figure  3.10d (0 second) with a blue reflection color as shown in Figure  3.10c (0 second). Upon 408‐nm light irradiation, photoisomerization of the azobenzene dopant enlarged the size of the BP lattice and shifted the corresponding reflection toward a longer wavelength. Increasing the irradiation time resulted in occurrence of the phase transition from BPII to BPI, which might be attributed to the chirality decrease with dopant isomerization. After the photoinduced phase transition took place, the lattice direction changed from (100) of BPII to (110) of BPI with the corresponding change of reflection wavelength from 520 to 575 nm. Subsequently, a redshift in reflection upon further irradiation at 408 nm was observed in BPI. If the irradiation was stopped at any time, the wavelength of the selective reflection does not change, except by the very slow thermal\nrelaxation effect of the dopant toward its initial trans form. The rapid reverse process can occur photochemically with 532‐nm light irradiation. Figure 3.10c shows BP images with various durations of pumping observed under a crossed polarized optical microscope at reflection mode. Upon 408‐nm light irradiation, the reflection color of the BP thin film changed from blue (BPII) to red (BPI) within 15 seconds. The BP thin films were also indexed using a Kossel diagram as shown in Figure  3.10d. Both blue and green images in Figure  3.10c corresponded to (100) lattices of BPII, while both yellow–green and red images represented (110) lattices of BPI. Figure 3.10d also exhibited the variation of the Kossel diagram with different exposure times at 408 nm. As the irradiation time increased from 0 to 15 seconds, the circle patterns of the (100) lattice of BPII enlarged, switching to a diamond‐shaped pattern corresponding to the (110) lattice of BPI, and gradually shrinking. It is noteworthy that increasing the dopant concentration shifted the initial BP reflection to the UV region, which was tuned across the entire visible region with a broad range upon 408‐nm light irradiation,\n108 3 Light‐Driven Self‐Organized Liquid Crystalline Nanostructures Enabled\nand the reflection bands of BPII redshifted from the UV to 520 nm. Once BPII transformed into BPI, the corresponding reflection bands discontinuously jumped to 560 nm, which was further redshifted from 560 to 710 nm within the BPI state.\nWang et  al. demonstrated NIR‐light‐driven dynamic tuning of 3D BP nanostructures by incorporating hydrophobic mesogen‐functionalized GNRs (M‐ GNRs) into a temperature‐sensitive BP medium composed of commercially available components [117]. Owing to the excellent thermoresponsive properties of BPs, their 3D nanostructures could be manipulated with the “photothermal effect” of M‐GNRs, i.e. converting NIR light into heat through a non‐radiative relaxation process of longitudinal surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) [118– 120]. In the experiment, the liquid crystalline composites doped with 0.07 wt% concentrations of M‐GNRs were prepared by dispersing the M‐GNRs into BP LCs. On cooling from isotropic phase, BPII firstly appeared at 46.4 °C and then transformed into BPI at 44.1 °C. As the temperature was further decreased to 37.2 °C, the phase completely changed into the cholesteric phase (Figure 3.11a). Additionally, the BPs formed the characteristic platelet textures, and the reflection color gradually changed to a longer wavelength with decreasing temperature. Kossel diagram was used to verify the BP lattice structures upon changing the temperature as shown in Figure  3.11b. The isotropic phase did not yield any Kossel diagram. A prominent circular pattern appeared in the temperature range of BPII, which resulted from the (100) lattice of the simple cubic BPII. As the temperature decreased from BPII to BPI, the diffraction ring switched to the characteristic diamond‐shaped pattern corresponding to the (110) lattice of body‐centered cubic BPI. The introduction of M‐GNRs was not only beneficial in stabilizing the cubic nanostructure, but also enabled the dynamic control of 3D BP nanostructures between body‐centered cubic and simple cubic symmetry under irradiation using an 808‐nm NIR laser due to the significant photothermal effect of M‐GNRs (Figure 3.11c). The reverse process occurs upon removal of the NIR laser irradiation. Furthermore, dynamic NIR‐light‐directed RGB reflections were for the first time demonstrated by tuning the lattice constant of the light‐driven 3D soft photonic crystals.\nMore recently, Zheng et al. demonstrated light‐directed crystallographic patterns of self‐organized 3D BP nanostructures by using a photoalignment technique (Figure 3.12) [121, 122]. The basic idea is that the cubic nanostructures of BPs exhibit a uniform crystallographic orientation on both microscopic and macroscopic scales at the UV‐light‐exposed areas, and a random orientation at the unexposed areas. As a result, various desired patterns of uniform crystallographic orientation could be obtained in a BP cell with appropriate patterned photoalignment treatment on one substrate. Interestingly, such an alternate uniform and random orientation pattern formed by the BP lattice could exhibit interesting optical diffraction and responsiveness to different external stimuli. The resultant crystallographic patterns could be reversibly erased and rewritten on demand by light thanks to the rewritable trait of the photoalignment thin film. This work could provide important insights on the controllability of crystallographic orientation of functional soft materials and their diverse photonic applications.\n3.4 Light‐Driven Chiral Liquid Crystal Microdroplets and Microshells\nSelf‐organized 3D superstructures with spherical configurations have recently received considerable attention in the forefront of multitudinous research areas, such as optical sensors or manipulations, soft photonics, and microfluidics [123]. Liquid crystalline microdroplets and microshells, i.e. confining LCs in micrometer‐ or nanometer‐sized superstructures, represent an elegant example of the topic. Recent advances of microfluidic techniques have enabled the fast, simple, and convenient fabrication of stable 3D monodisperse microdroplets with controllable symmetry, shapes, and sizes [124]. Fan et al. demonstrated\nthe photonic cross‐communication between monodisperse CLC  microdroplets, where their self‐assembly was precisely manipulated by using the microfluidic method [125–127]. Only a central reflection spot was observed in the isolated single microdroplet due to the absence of any lateral communication (Figure 3.13a). In the groups of two or more microdroplets, it was surprising that the reflection‐related interactions were found between neighboring microdroplets (Figure 3.13b–e). When the microdroplets are densely packed into the hexagonally symmetric monolayer, the circular “lit fire‐cracker” patterns were formed because of the photonic cross‐communication in the neighboring microdroplets (Figure 3.13f ). Moreover, the intensity of photonic cross‐interaction was found to depend strongly on the distance between microdroplets, and the photonic cross‐communication completely disappeared when the distance was five times larger than the diameter of the microdroplets. It is worth mentioning that omnidirectional RGB reflections in the microdroplets have been\nachieved by using a novel thermally stable photochromic chiral molecular switch. They could also readily modulate the reflection color of every single microdroplet independently, and Figure 3.13g,h illustrates the “flower‐ opening” patterns with light‐directed iridescent colors in eight monodisperse microdroplets. Such monodisperse microdroplets and their periodic arrays would not only provide a rich and fascinating platform for fundamental theoretical studies of micro/nanophotonics with geometric confinements but also hold great potential for applications in the photonic and opto‐electronic devices.\nRecently, Wang et  al. reported optically reconfigurable monodisperse cholesteric microspheres with dynamic chirality using the capillary‐based microfluidic technique [128]. They judiciously designed and developed a cholesteric system with phototunable handedness inversion capability by the opposite‐ handedness doping of a powerful left‐handed chiral molecular switch and a photoinsensitive right‐handed chiral molecule into an achiral liquid crystalline host (Figure 3.14). The selective reflection of the handedness‐invertible CLCs was facilely tuned from infrared to visible and ultraviolet regions by appropriately adjusting the relative concentrations of both chiral molecules. The monodisperse chiral microspheres of photoresponsive CLCs with different initial chirality were fabricated using a capillary‐based microfluidic technique. Interestingly, they observed the light‐driven structural transformations accompanied by dynamic handedness inversion in the cholesteric microdroplets with low chirality. Reducing the concentration of both chiral dopants in the LC host, i.e. low chirality, enabled the direct observation of microstructure evolution upon light irradiations due to the pitch of cholesterics in the micrometer range. As shown in Figure 3.15a, left‐handed double spiralized patterns without apparent disclination were initially observed within the microdroplets under polarized optical\nmicroscope. Upon UV irradiation at 365 nm, the period of spiraling structures gradually increased due to the decrease in the chirality of CLCs (Figure 3.15b–d), followed by the appearance of a bipolar nematic configuration with point defects at the two poles of microdroplets (Figure 3.15e). Continued UV irradiation led to the formation of right‐handed double spiralized patterns with decreasing periods (Figure 3.15f–j). The concentric ring pattern with line defects across the droplets (Figure  3.15k) and diametrical configuration (Figure  3.15l) with ring defects were subsequently observed until the photostationary state. The simultaneous observation of diverse characteristic patterns in this single dynamic system is unprecedented although these topological configurations have been theoretically predicted and experimentally investigated [129–132]. It is worth noting that phototunable RGB photonic cross‐communication patterns were observed in the handedness invertible CLCs with high chirality. A multicolored complex pattern with a bright red central spot surrounded by multiple radial blue lines was observed at the initial state due to the photonic cross‐communications among different cholesteric microdroplets. UV irradiations at 365 nm led to the elongation of the helical pitch of CLCs and subsequent redshift of central and peripheral reflections of microdroplets. Continued UV exposure enabled the vivid observation of handedness inversion in cholesteric microdroplets accompanied by the disappearance of cross‐communicated reflections, and the photonic cross‐communication reflections with opposite chirality would be\nobserved if keeping the sample at the photostationary state for around five minutes. These light‐driven dynamic processes were reversible and repeated many times without noticeable degradation. The research is expected to provide a new platform for fundamental studies of micro/nanophotonics with geometric confinements, which hold potential applications in the photonic and opto‐ electronic devices.\nMicrofluidic techniques have also been demonstrated in fabricating the CLC microshells with spherical configurations that can act as 3D omnidirectional lasers due to the radial molecular arrangement within the cholesteric microshells. Uchida et al. first reported the fabrication of cholesteric microshells with water–oil–water double phase by using the microfluidic method [133], in which the oil phase is composed of dye‐doped CLCs. By combining different laser dyes with CLC hosts, three types of laser modes, i.e. distributed feedback (DFB), distributed Bragg reflection (DBR) and whispering‐gallery‐mode (WGM) resonators, are successfully obtained on the basis of the CLC microshells. Subsequently, Chen et al. demonstrated the fabrication and lasing properties of photochromic monodisperse cholesteric liquid crystalline microshells through capillary‐based microfluidic techniques (Figure  3.16) [134], where the photoresponsive CLCs\nwere developed by loading a chiral azobenzene photoswitch responsive to visible light into a nematic LC host. When the cholesteric microshells loaded with DCM (4‐dicyanomethylene‐2‐methyl‐6‐p‐dimethylamino‐styrl‐4H‐pyran) laser dye were pumped under an external pulsed laser, laser emissions in all optical directions were achieved, where the emission wavelength was found to be able to self‐ tune because of the photoisomerization of the azobenzene chiral switch."

      "text" : "Liquid crystalline materials represent a fascinating state of matter that combines crystalline order and fluidic mobility on a molecular and supramolecular level. Such unique combination results in the LC being typically “soft” and responding easily to external stimuli. In this chapter, we provided a glimpse of the research advances in the development of light‐driven self‐organized liquid crystalline nanostructures enabled by chiral molecular switches or motors. Toward the fabrication of photoactive liquid crystalline nanostructures, a variety of new ideas and strategies have been developed for the design and synthesis of diverse chiral molecular photoswitches with exceptionally high HTPs and handedness inversion capabilities. The high HTP values have enabled the photoresponsive chiral LCs with superior properties by the addition of small\n115Acknowledgments\nquantities of the chiral photoswitches, and the wide tunability of the HTP furnishes reflection colors encompassing the whole visible spectrum and beyond in a reversible manner. Photomodulation of chiral LCs has been achieved by UV‐, visible‐, and NIR‐light irradiation. Through rational molecular design, some chiral photoswitches could confer helix inversion to the cholesteric systems for photonic applications involving CPL. Photoresponsive chiral LCs can be considered as a model system in soft matter research for induction, amplification, and inversion of chirality with dynamic and multifunctional qualities. Photoactive LCs with adaptive PBGs could find many new applications such as tunable mirrorless lasing, optical polarizers, and smart switchable reflective windows to control solar light.\nIt is anticipated that LC‐based photonic crystals could open a new area of research about soft matter photonics. Owing to the unique self‐organized properties and high stimuli sensitivity, these liquid crystalline photonic nanostructures can efficiently and selectively transmit and amplify local molecular information in a controllable manner, which undoubtedly offers an attractive route for versatile advanced photonic applications. For example, CLCs can be considered as 1D photonic crystals, while cubic superstructures of BP LCs and spherically symmetric superstructures of LC microdroplets are fascinating for tunable “soft” 3D photonic crystals. These liquid crystalline nanostructures could also function as powerful soft templates to direct the dynamic self‐assembly of nanomaterials into various well‐defined functional architectures via different noncovalent molecular interactions over multiple length scales. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, looking forward, the marriage of LC science with the emerging capabilities in nanoscience and nanotechnology could provide significant insights for developing programmable and reconfigurable advanced functional materials with myriad possibilities. Taking lessons from nature, researchers could develop novel soft photonic superstructures with extraordinary complexity, where the discrete building blocks can be self‐assembled through complex and multiple interactions of liquid crystalline matter. Future investigations in such a promising field with multidisciplinary cooperation of scientists and engineers from different backgrounds would not only broaden our knowledge of fundamental soft matter science, but also promote their diverse technological applications in areas of dynamic photonics, optoelectronics, and beyond [135]."

      "text" : "Chirality or “handedness” is a prerequisite of the biological world, where life exists in a specific chirality. In living organisms, almost all the sugars are exclusively right‐handed (d‐isomer), amino acids are left‐handed (l‐isomer), and DNA coils assemble into right‐handed helices [1]. The reason behind this homochirality is still an unresolved issue. Inspired by the natural homochirality, the scientific community has been interested in exploring the mechanism of transmission of chirality from the molecular level of monomeric units to the macro‐ or supramolecular level, as well as the origin of chirality [2, 3]. The supramolecular chirality in nature from self‐assembled achiral molecules and its specific handedness play a crucial role in the evolution of life and the development of supramolecular materials. While the chirality of molecules is of configurational and conformational origin, supramolecular level chirality arises from the organization of molecules, with formation of a chiral superstructure by means of long‐ range positional and orientational orders of molecules [4].\nThe use of external stimuli to generate and control the asymmetry at various scales has been an important issue to mimic the homochirality of nature and to create smart supramolecular systems. Different types of stimulus such as chiral solvents [5, 6] and chiral additives [7] have been utilized to obtain enantiomeric imbalance from the achiral (racemic) system. Among the possible external stimuli, light is a versatile external stimulus with a tunable circular polarization of right‐ and left‐handedness in addition to light intensity and wavelength, which allow control of the mesomorphic reorganization. Soft materials exhibiting photoresponsive chiroptical functions provide genuine applications that include advanced displays, reflectors, information storages, chiral sensors with amplified responses, chiral recognition processes, and actuators [8, 9]. Moreover, they can offer photoresponsive chiral templates for enantioselective photochemical synthesis [10, 11], and circularly polarized light (CPL)‐triggered chiral photopolymerization with visible light [12] or near‐infrared (NIR) light source [13]. As a\nPhotochemical Chirality Induction and Inversion in Soft Materials Yuna Kim, Noushaba N.

Moreover, the elastic property of soft materials including liquid crystals, polymers, and gels has shown its capability: expression of chiral information to the entire system through amplification [25, 26].\nIn this chapter, we report on the recent progress harnessing chirality induction in achiral molecules by utilizing light as a chiral stimulus to achieve chiral assemblies based on photochromic switches in soft materials such as liquid crystals and polymeric organizations. In addition, we also discuss the modulation of their induced supramolecular chirality such as helix inversion between opposite handedness and helical twisting power (HTP) control through photochemical reactions. Our chapter would provide an opportunity to better understand molecular chirality control over a mesoscale chiral organization."

In these photo‐triggers, photochemical interconversion is possible directly between a pair of thermally stable enantiomers, or via non‐chiral intermediates. Feringa and coworkers [31] introduced the CPL‐induced photoresolution of sterically overcrowded alkene system 1, but the process required a relatively long irradiation time to get the enantiomeric excess. Tamaoki and coworkers accomplished the fast CPL‐induced chirality and molecular‐level enantiomeric excess for different types of cyclic and noncyclic azobenzenes exhibiting reversible trans (E)–cis (Z) isomerization upon light irradiation (Figure 4.1). The bicyclic azobenzene dimer 2 has a complicated enantio‐differentiating photoisomerization path with three isomers (EE, EZ, and ZZ) associated with planar chirality [32]. The monocyclic planar chiral azo‐molecule 3 also exhibits an enantiomeric excess that is induced by CPL irradiation where the r (right‐handed)‐ or l (left‐handed)‐CPL at 488 nm repeatedly induces the partial enrichment of the S or R enantiomers, respectively (Figure 4.1e,f ) [29]. Noncyclic achiral azobenzene dimer 4 with two symmetrically arranged azobenzene units generates the chirality and enantiomeric excess at its EZ isomer state under CPL irradiation at a single wavelength [33].\nAlthough the photochemical generation of molecular level asymmetry has been achieved as described above, its amplification to the supramolecular system is considered as a challenging issue. The induced chirality plays an important role in the supramolecular system where chirality is generated by the molecular alignment of a large number of achiral molecules, through the asymmetry information transfer process from a small number of chiral molecules.\n128 4 Photochemical Chirality Induction and Inversion in Soft Materials\nUsually in the supramolecular system, asymmetry information transfer occurs via noncovalent weak interactions, such as van der Waals interaction, π–π stacking, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and host–guest interaction [8]. In this section, we introduce CPL‐ or circularly polarized UV light (CPUL)‐ triggered chirality induction from achiral soft materials doped or substituted with photoswitches including low molecular weight (LMW) liquid crystals, self‐ assembled supramolecules, and achiral polymers. Facile control of chirality upon CPL irradiation – not only the chiral induction with specific handedness, but also the erasing and changing of the handedness direction – is demonstrated."

      "text" : "pitch (P) is the distance along the helical axis when the molecules complete a full turn, and a positive handedness represents a right‐handed helix, whereas a negative handedness represents a left‐handed helix (Scheme 4.1). The helical pitch length is generally longer than a few hundreds of nanometers in the case of cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC). The periodic helical structures can selectively reflect the CPL of a certain wavelength matching its helical pitch length. The photoinduction of helical organization has been accomplished by irradiating CPL from achiral LMW liquid crystals (LCs).\nIn 1995, Schuster et al. reported on the first chiroptical trigger for a liquid crystal based on a series of axially chiral bicyclic ketones [28]. The racemic axially chiral bicyclic ketone exhibited a partial photoresolution (ee = 0.4%) by CPL irradiation although the enantiomeric enrichment hardly led to the efficient nematic to cholesteric phase transition. In 1996, Feringa et al. described a photoswitchable compound based on overcrowded alkene (1) capable of undergoing partial photoresolution within a nematic liquid crystal (NLC), a process that was able to induce the formation of a cholesteric phase [31]. Its two enantiomeric forms – P and M, due to its inherent helical shape – can interconvert by CPL irradiation at 313 nm (Figure  4.2). When photochemical resolution was undertaken in a nematic host, a cholesteric texture was observed from the racemic compound enriched with one of the enantiomers.\nChoi et al. [34] utilized CPL as the irradiation source, which led to enantiomeric excess values in two chiral domains in the Bx phase of bent‐core achiral molecules (5) as shown in Figure 4.3. The helical direction was arbitrarily regulated by irradiating with l‐ and r‐handed CPL as observed from circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the BX phase (Figure 4.3c) of 5 before and after CPL irradiation (Figure 4.3b,c).\nMoreover, columnar liquid crystals are also known to be suitable candidates to build chiral supramolecular architectures based on helical organizations. Sierra and coworkers exploited unique columnar liquid crystals such that CPL can be utilized to induce a chiral phase [35]. The authors combined the two systems by combining columnar LCs and supramolecular macrocycles to achieve transferring of the chirality of CPL to the achiral systems. Previous results of their\n130 4 Photochemical Chirality Induction and Inversion in Soft Materials\nresearch showed that non‐mesogenic carboxylic acids endowed with a rigid V shape form H‐bonded complexes with a melamine derivative (6). These complexes self‐organize into helical columnar mesomorphic systems, the chirality of which is controlled by chiral building blocks and/or CPL (Figure 4.4).\nFurthermore, by controlling the orthogonal action of H‐bonding interaction such as melamine–melamine and melamine–acid (Figure 4.5a, T : A [1 : 1]\ncomplex), their hierarchical self‐assembly was integrated into rosette‐like two‐ dimensional hexagonal columnar (Colh) mesophases (Figure  4.5b) [36]. The modulation of the chirality of Colh mesophases was achieved with CPL. The rosette‐type association from 7 exhibits intense CD bands (Figure  4.5c) upon irradiation with CPL, indicating the induction of chirality into the supramolecular systems. On irradiation with light of the opposite handedness, the CD shows the opposite sign, which indicates that the supramolecular chirality of the mesophase can be inverted by the external chiral radiation. In particular, these columns could accommodate the ions of a salt such as lithium triflate (7‐LiTf complex), exhibiting comparable CPL‐induced chirality control of the mesophase as shown in Figure 4.5d.\nA compensated nematic phase is an achiral nematic phase arising from a racemic mixture of equal amounts of chiral dopants with opposite twist sense in host NLC. It is generally observed during the switching between two chiral nematic phases of opposite handedness. Kurihara et al. [37] reported on the compensated nematic (racemic) phase at the nonirradiated initial state. By harnessing the mixture of chiral dopant (8) and the chiral azobenzene derivative (9) in nematic E44 (20 wt%), a reversible switching between the racemic and the cholesteric phases was obtained by trans–cis photoisomerization through UV and visible light irradiation, respectively (Figure 4.6). Li et al. [38] demonstrated that axially chiral dithienylperfluorocyclopentene (10) is able to induce a nematic‐like phase at a\nvery low doping concentration (0.1 mol% in 5CB), and it exhibits reversible isothermal phase transition between nematic and cholesteric phases upon light irradiation (Figure 4.7)."

The first demonstration on CD achieved from an achiral polymer was an induced chirality by irradiating it with CPL to 11 bearing azobenzene moieties through its chain alignment [39]. This phenomenon can be explained by the Weigert effect [9, 40]: the photoreaction efficiency of a molecule undergoing photoisomerization largely enhances when the direction of the transition moment of the molecule is parallel to the axis of the polarized light. Azobenzenes undergo repetitive trans‐to‐cis and cis‐to‐trans isomerizations by light irradiation so that the long axes of the molecules lie in a direction perpendicular to the optical field direction. In the case of CPL irradiation, the molecules align in the direction perpendicular to the optical field rotating in the thickness direction; then, the long axes of the molecules become gyratory in the thickness direction [41].\nTejedor et  al. [42] studied CD responses of a series of liquid crystalline homopolymers bearing a methoxyazobenzene group in the side chain, (12), by illuminating with 488‐nm CPL. The illumination of a nematic polymer film produced a helical organization as confirmed from CD spectra (Figure 4.9a), which resembles a chiral nematic phase as observed in the wedge cell image (Figure 4.9c) and under polarized optical microscope (POM) (Figure 4.9d). The CPL‐ irradiated region with a planar orientation exhibits an iridescent green color that corresponds to a selective reflection of a helicoidal organization. Moreover, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra after CPL irradiation (Figure  4.9b) indicate that only the mesogenic azobenzene units are involved in the chiral supramolecular organization. Consequently, using the chiral exciting light, supramolecular chirality is generated at the molecular level with an asymmetric photoisomerization, which possibly results in the conversion of a glassy nematic phase into a cholesteric phase at room temperature. Recently, the authors have achieved chiral photoinduction by CPL even in achiral amorphous azopolymers based on a constitutional repeating unit containing both a 4‐cyanoazobenzene moiety and a promesogenic 4‐cyanobiphenyl moiety (13) [43].\nChoi et  al. reported on main‐chain polymeric liquid crystal systems doped with azobenzene‐containing W‐shaped molecules (14) [44]. The nucleated W‐ shaped molecules underwent preferential twisted conformation by CPL irradiation, and could trigger the local formation of a chiral structure in the doped main‐chain polymer LC medium.\nRecently, Wang et al. have verified the CPL wavelength dependence on the photogeneration and photoswitching modes and regulated azobenzene supramolecular chirality in an optofluidic medium [45]. The authors chose azobenzene with flexible linkers attached to chain‐like polymethacrylate (15) dispersed as micrometer‐sized aggregates in an optofluidic medium with a tuned refractive index (nD). According to their careful study, it was revealed that the choice of CPL wavelength (313 nm and 365/405/436 nm) is the determining factor for photogeneration, photoresolution, and photoswitching of the azobenzene polymer aggregates, regardless of the sense of the CPL source (Figure  4.10a–c). Moreover, irradiating the aggregates with a CPL source at 365 nm induces almost optically pure chiral azobenzene aggregates with a maximum dissymmetry ratio of gCD ≈ ±1.0 × 10−2 at 313 nm. In addition, a distinctive chiroptical switching of 15 aggregates in dichloroethane/methylcyclohexane (0.5/2.5, v/v)\n1374.2 Chirality Induction from Achiral Soft Materials by CPL\nwas attainable under alternating 313 and 436 nm CPL irradiation with the same sense (Figure 4.10d)."

On the other hand, diacetylenes are known to undergo topochemical polymerization during UV and γ‐irradiation in the solid state. Taking advantage of CPL‐triggered rearrangement of azobenzene chromophores in the side chains, Iwamoto and coworkers reported that chiroptically active polydiacetylenes (PDAs) bearing azobenzene residues could be obtained from achiral 16, by irradiation with either r‐ or l‐ CPUL or CP laser treatment (Figure 4.11) [46]. Upon unpolarized UV polymerization, a chiral structure of the PDA backbone was accidentally obtained and the sign of the chirality was not controlled. In contrast, the designed chiral structure of the PDA backbone could be realized by using CPUL, and the handedness direction could be modulated to opposite enantiomeric structures by irradiation with opposite handedness CPL (Figure 4.11b). The authors inferred that the stereoregular packing of azobenzene chromophores in the side chains plays a dominating role in the formation of enantiomeric helical PDA chains, and the CPL treatment is effective in adjusting the stereoregular packing of azobenzene units.\nMeanwhile, Kim and coworkers have reported that helicity induction, modulation, and memory of supramolecular helical assemblies were achieved from an achiral triphenylamine derivative bearing photopolymerizable diacetylene units (17) by CPL and CPUL (Figure  4.12) [47]. Irradiation of 17 in a chlorinated solvent by r‐ or l‐handed CPL resulted in the formation of a preferred‐handed\nsupramolecular helical assembly, and the resultant helix sense could be reversibly switched by CPL irradiation with the opposite rotational direction as depicted in Figure 4.13. Interestingly, such switching did not occur after photopolymerization of the diacetylene unit helical assembly of 17 in the preferred handedness by irradiation using CPUL with the same rotational direction as the CPL used for the helicity induction of 17, due to the covalent fixation of the supramolecular helical structure.\nRoyes et  al. [48] showcased an achiral azobenzene‐based gelator exhibiting photochemical chiral induction in supramolecular organization. The organogel based on the achiral crown ether azobenzene gelator (18) shown in Figure 4.14a was supported by a 2D layer nanostructure (Figure 4.14b), and a new class of chiral material has been obtained by the 488‐nm r‐ and l‐CPL irradiation of the\nachiral gel, as confirmed from electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra (Figure 4.14c). This chiral photoinduction is possibly attributed to the preferential excitation of nonplanar conformers of the azo‐gelator predicted from the crystal structure (Figure 4.14d)."

The CLC superstructure is endowed with a helical pitch (P) and handedness. The pitch (P) is the distance along the helical axis when the molecules complete a full turn, and a positive sign represents a right‐handed CLC while a negative sign represents a left‐handed CLC. The right‐handed CLC can selectively reflect r‐CPL and transmit l‐CPL (those of opposite for left‐handed CLC) with the reflection wavelength corresponding to the pitch length of the helical superstructure. The ability of a chiral molecule to induce a helical structure in an achiral NLC can be quantified in terms of the HTP (β), as expressed in Eq. (4.1).\n= ( )−PC 1 (4.1) where C is the concentration of the chiral dopant and P is the pitch [52].\nAt the helix inversion point, the net HTP value of the chiral dopant becomes zero due to the presence of equal amounts of the isomers with opposite signs. Consequently, the pitch approaches infinite value, resulting in an achiral nematic phase. This nematic phase can also be referred as a racemic mixture of left‐ handed and right‐handed CLCs [53].\nIn the CLC system, it is noteworthy that a high initial HTP value and its large photoinduced variation are advantageous in terms of the amount required (low doping concentration) to induce and modulate the cholesteric phase, which contributes to the selective reflection color to be tuned over a wide range of wavelengths and the large amplitude of mechanical motion control [20, 54, 55].

Among the chiral azobenzene dopants undergoing trans–cis photoisomerization, some planar chiral and axially chiral azobenzene derivatives have been reported to exhibit chiral inversion by UV and visible light irradiation. Planar chiral azobenzenes [54, 59, 60] are known to exhibit large HTP photoswitching, which is ascribed not only to the close distance between the chiral center and the mesogen unit but also to unifying the photoresponsive moieties and chiral moieties in a single moiety by cyclization. Tamaoki et al. demonstrated an interesting phenomenon that the bicyclic azophanes with planar chirality (19) shown in Figure 4.15A could reversibly change not only the HTP but also the handedness of a CLC by light irradiation without any molecular racemization of enantiomers during the photoisomerization (Figure 4.15B) [61]. (R) E,E‐19 of 1 wt% was dissolved in ZLI‐1132 and introduced into a wedge‐type cell at room temperature. As depicted in Figure 4.15C, a reversible change occurred in pitch length by irradiation of UV and visible light. N phase was obtained in between the transition of cholesteric phases with opposite handedness upon continuous exposure to UV light, and the photoinduced maximum HTP switching ratio was over 600% (Table 4.1).\n144 4 Photochemical Chirality Induction and Inversion in Soft Materials\nAxially chiral binaphthyl moieties are feasible for controlling the helical sense and strength of the CLC. The binaphthyl derivative is known to have restricted freedom of internal rotation along the carbon–carbon bond between the 1 and 1′ positions of the binaphthyl rings. The helicity of the binaphthyl derivative therefore depends on the dihedral angle (θ) between the two naphthyl rings: cisoid (θ  < 90°) or transoid (θ  > 90°) conformation affects the helical sense and twist intensity of doped CLCs [69]. Some examples from axially chiral azobenzene dopants have also been reported to exhibit photoinduced reversible handedness inversion. Li and coworkers reported on cyclic azobenzophane dopants bearing binaphthyl units (20 in Table 4.1) with 425% of maximum HTP switching upon cis‐isomerization, and a recovery of the original handedness upon visible light irradiation [62].\nThe authors also developed a type of azobenzene compound substituted with axially chiral binaphthyl units of both the same and opposite chiral configurations (21) shown in Figure 4.16A [63]. The handedness inversion in LC hosts (5CB, E7 and ZLI‐1132) could be induced with CLC containing the dopants with opposite chiral configurations (S,R,S) upon UV light irradiation accompanying the chiral nematic and racemic nematic phases (Figure  4.16B), followed by a decent recovery of their original handedness and HTP (up to 90%) at photostationary state (PSSvis) as described in Table 4.1, whereas a compound with the same chiral configurations (R,R,R) exhibited no handedness inversion. Therefore,\n1454.3 Photochemical Chirality Inversion from Chiral Soft Materials\nthe introduction of chiral conflict at the molecular level plausibly influences the handedness inversion of CLC through an equilibrium shifting between opposite chiral configurations in a single chiral switch.\nMoreover, Fu et al. have investigated a dopant system similar to that mentioned above, where additional chiral units were incorporated into a chiral azobenzene unit by hydrogen bond (22 in Figure  4.17a) [64]. The binaphthyl azobenzene molecule was used as a proton acceptor, and binaphthyl acids with opposite chiral configuration were introduced as proton donors forming H‐bonded chiral switches. As shown in Figure 4.17b, a phase transition from N* to N accompanying the helical inversion and the HTP increase or decrease in N* could be achieved upon light irradiation. The length of a terminal alkyl chain in proton donors of 22 affected the HTP and helix inversion characteristics of CLCs. Although the HTP values of 22 are quite small compared to those of 21, the HTP switching ratio reaches over 800% (Table 4.1)."

Binaphthyl moieties are known as powerful helicity inducers in achiral NLCs as described above. Thus, diarylethene dopants coupled with axially chiral binaphthyl moieties have been widely studied for photonic applications of CLCs taking advantage of the large HTP and its stable photoswitching properties  [23, 24]. In terms of dopant molecular design, modification of the binaphthyl units by substituting mesogen units possessing similar conformation to NLC host and/or bridging naphthyl groups has been attempted and these approaches bring a significant difference in the miscibility with the nematic host or the rigidity of the chiral conformation, which leads to various HTPs and handedness switching behaviors [57, 70, 71].\nAkagi et al. presented the first dynamic photoswitching of the helical inversion in CLCs based on a dithienylethene derivative bearing two axially chiral binaphthyl moieties (23) [65]. The photoisomerization of the dithienylethene moiety after irradiation with UV and visible light induces a reversible dihedral angle change of the binaphthyl rings. CLCs doped with the chiral dopant bearing the shortest alkyl chain in a binaphthyl moiety (23) exhibit reversible handedness switching via photoisomerization between the open and closed forms of the dithienylethene moiety (Figure 4.18).\nLi and coworkers demonstrated bridged binaphthyl‐substituted dithienylcyclopentenes shown in Figure 4.19A, which exhibit the helix inversion of CLCs with a bridge length of n = 4 (24) [66]. The bridged binaphthyl derivative normally has a higher HTP than that of the non‐bridged moieties due to its narrow dihedral angles, and an increase in bridge length may lead to increase in molecular flexibility with larger phototunabilities. Indeed, those of shorter bridge lengths (n = 2 and 3) [57] exhibited smaller HTP switching without any inversion of handedness. According to their report, 24 doped in 5CB, E7, or ZLI‐1132 underwent right‐ to left‐handed inversion upon UV light irradiation as shown in Figure 4.19B. Moreover, it showed the highest initial HTP of 54 μm−1 in 5CB, while 517% of maximum HTP switching ratio was obtained in ZLI‐1132.\nPhotoinduced large HTP switching and handedness inversion are attributable to the significant increase in the θ value of (S,S)‐24 from the open to the closed forms (Figure  4.19C). Especially, several optical applications were carried out based on this handedness invertible dithienylcyclopentene dopant (24) such as reflection color control by photoswitching of a cholesteric pitch length and NIR‐ light‐induced handedness inversion. The authors utilized 24 and an upconversion nanoparticle in CLC as a handedness switching inducer and NIR transducer, respectively [72].\nFurthermore, based on the unique helical sense inversion associated with dynamic reorganization of the entire superstructure, 24‐doped CLC was utilized for the three‐dimensional control of the helical axis [73]. UV irradiation (wavelength of 310 nm) of the chiral switch in a planar cell transformed the helical superstructure from its original standing helices (SHs) through the unwound homogeneous state and the SH arrangement with opposite handedness to the lying helix (LH) arrangement (Figure 4.20A). The authors confirmed the resultant control of helical axis by the transmitted light diffraction through a bilayer CLC sample as shown in Figure 4.20B. The dimensionality transformation was directly visualized between two‐dimensional, one‐dimensional, and the diffraction‐off states. In addition, the authors recently demonstrated the dynamically reconfigurable zigzag pattern deformation with (S,S)‐24 (3.7 wt% in E7) under the simultaneous influence of an applied electric field and light irradiation (Figure 4.21) [74]. The straight and zigzag‐shaped patterns could be generated and terminated repeatedly on demand, and easily manipulated by alternating irradiation with ultraviolet and visible light [74]. The cohesive and facile phototuning of the helical axis can be promising for advanced 3D photonic devices."

Irradiation with UV light results in its P‐helicity switching to M‐helicity, which accompanies the large HTP switching (Table 4.1). However, as the isomer with M‐helicity is not thermally stable, non‐photochemical transition from M‐ to P‐helicity occurs. The\ncorresponding light‐directing handedness inversion has been observed in a CLC fabricated from E7 doped with 1 wt% of 25 upon irradiation with UV light, with the reverse process occurring spontaneously at room temperature (Figure 4.23). After 135 seconds of irradiation with 365 nm light, it reached the helix inversion point and a non‐chiral nematic phase (compensated nematic, Figure 4.23b) was formed without a cholesteric fingerprint texture. Further irradiation induced the rewinding of the cholesteric helix with an opposite handedness (Figure 4.23c). In particular, a micro‐sized glass rod floated on the CLC film exhibited opposite rotational direction via non‐ rotational movement state according to the handedness change of CLC, reflecting that molecular level chirality change can be translated to the macroscopic level (Figure 4.23). White et al. [67] and Aßhoff et al. [81] confirmed the reversible and broad tunability of the helical pitch length and photoinvertible handedness of overcrowded‐alkenes‐based CLCs (Figure 4.24). Especially Aßhoff et al. showed that the thermal relaxation rate of the cholesteric helix can be fully determined through the helix inversion process of the overcrowded alkene motors.\nChen et  al. reported on 10,11‐disubstituted dibenzeosuberane (DBS)‐based helicenes (26), which undergo molecular helicity inversion upon photoisomerization (Figure 4.25A) [68]. The induced CLC phase in E7 was found to exhibit light‐driven handedness inversion through photoisomerization of the dopant by sequential irradiation with UV light of different wavelengths, 290, 310, and 330 nm. The selective photoswitching is driven by the conformation control of the top DBS template unit. Alternating irradiation at these three different wavelengths resulted in a diverse photomodulation of the pitch length, handedness reversal, and chirality turn‐off mode of the cholesteric mesophase (Figure 4.25B). Moreover, the authors demonstrated a unique type of helicene (27), which is a derivative of 26 incorporating aromatic amide (“aramide”) moieties in the top C2‐symmetric dibenzosuberane template  [82]. This C2‐symmetric dibenzosuberane‐based helicene bearing gallamide groups is converted into its pseudoenantiomeric helicene P′ through the photoisomerization of the dibenzosuberane\nresidue upon UV irradiation. This complementary helicity inversion was reversible, and the P/M ratio could be regulated by irradiation of a selected wavelength in the solution state (Figure 4.26a). Interestingly, 27 could reversibly self‐ assemble to form a gel depending on the ratio of P and M based on the intermolecular amide hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking (Figure 4.26b). Either a left‐ or a right‐handed helical superstructure was obtained as confirmed from transmission electron microscope (TEM) image and CD spectra (Figure 4.26c,d)."

The photochemical control of the macromolecular helical handedness or the cholesteric pitch has been achieved using multiple photochromic molecular switches in the side chains [83, 84], or a single photoswitchable unit at the end of the polymer chain [85]. Upon photoisomerization of the pendant unit, the\nhandedness of the polymer backbone reverses, which in turn prompts handedness inversion of the whole supramolecular structure. The relatively low free energy difference between the right‐ and left‐handed helical states allows the helical sense preference of the helical polymer to be switched into the opposite handedness dynamically. In 2000, Schuster et  al. demonstrated a system in which chiral information of CPL is used to control the helical sense of a polymer [86] (Figure 4.27). A racemic mixture of a photoresolvable ketone [28] and an achiral alkyl group was appended to a polyisocyanate (28) having equal populations of dynamically interconverting l‐ and r‐handed helical backbone conformations. Irradiation of the pendant ketone group with CPL results in its partial photoresolution (Figure 4.27b). The majority rule effect [87] transfers the chirality of the pendant group to the polymer backbone helix, resulting in amplification of the photoresolution as observed from CD signals that changed sign with a change in the sense of the CPL (Figure 4.27c,d). The small enantiomeric excess produced by the irradiation, even diluted with large proportions of achiral pendants, is capable of enforcing a disproportionate excess of one helical sense in the polymer [86].

Later, the authors discovered that the helix‐sense of an optically active polyisocyanate copolymer (29 in Figure 4.28a) of a chiral isocyanate bearing an azobenzene side group containing two stereogenic centers with an achiral isocyanate can be switched by the photoisomerization of the azobenzene moiety from the trans to cis form (Figure 4.28b) [83, 89]. The helix inversion permits the reversible switching between P and M helices by controlling the proximity of the chiral center to the polymer backbone (Figure 4.28c).\nBarberá et al.

In this system, the polymer, in the smectic phase (Figure 4.29a,b), is provided chirality originating at the molecular level by the asymmetric functionality of the l‐lactic acid unit. It is of highly homogeneous conformation with a prevailing chirality that appears related to the presence of H‐aggregates having conformational dissymmetry of one prevailing screw sense. Upon irradiation with l‐CPL, the CD spectra of the films show enhancement of ellipticity and a net inversion sign (Figure  4.29c). Additionally, the mirror image of the CD spectra could be restored by pumping with r‐CPL (Figure 4.29d).\nIamsaard et al. demonstrated a macroscopic helical motion control with a liquid crystalline chiral azopolymer [50].

By cutting the resultant polymer film in a specific direction, a polymer spring was formed.

The authors covalently linked an overcrowded‐alkene‐based molecular switch to the terminus of a polyisocyanate polymer (Figure 4.31A). This terminal functionalization with molecular motor enabled light‐driven reversible control over the handedness of the polyisocyanate backbone. The\nreversible handedness inversion by photoirradiation was obtained from photoresponsive lyotropic CLC as seen in Figure  4.31A. Cholesteric texture and pitch clearly made transitions upon UV or visible light irradiation, which resulted in the ratio change between (2′S)‐(M)‐32 and (2′S)‐(P)‐32 form, as observed from POM images in Figure 4.31B.\nMeanwhile, Zhao et al. [92] reported on molecular‐motor‐based double helicates (33 in Figure 4.32a) in which, for the first time, the multistage assembly process and helicity could be driven by light in a fully reversible manner. The responsive supramolecular systems with a stepwise change in self‐assembly of metal complexes were induced by a light‐driven rotary motor scaffold as described in Figure 4.32b. The sequence of events in this dynamic self‐assembled system (from oligomers to monomers and a direction of helix inversion of P′ → M′ or M′ → P′) is governed by the unidirectional rotary motion of the motor unit. Initially, coordination oligomers of bipyridine–Cu(I) complex can be formed by treating 33 with Cu(I). Then, these oligomers can split into monomers with P′‐helicity due to the unidirectional rotation of the molecular motor from the stable (P,P)‐trans state to the less stable (M,M)‐cis state upon light irradiation. The mechanism of disassembly of the oligomers or unfolding of the metal‐helicates following irradiation could plausibly be a partial unwrapping of the complex, assisted by acetonitrile as a small monodentate ligand for Cu(I), that precedes the photoisomerization steps. The inversion of the chirality of the Cu‐helicate from P′ to M′ is governed by a subsequent thermal helical inversion (from M,M to P,P) of the molecular motor core structure. Photoisomerization of stable (P,P)‐cis state to  (M,M)‐cis state through the rotary cycle via the\ntrans‐oligomeric state inverts the chirality of the Cu‐helicate back from M′ to P′. In UV–vis absorption spectra (Figure 4.32c), the change in the visible light region is ascribed to a metal‐to‐ligand charge‐transfer (MLCT) band, and the corresponding CD signals (Figure 4.32d) help determine the absolute configuration inversion of the dinuclear helicates (positive Cotton effect for P′ helicity and negative for M′ helicity)."

It is demonstrated that either a right‐ or a left‐handed CPL can be utilized to induce a preferred‐ handed helical conformation in a dynamically racemic helical superstructure in the solid state, which appears to be one of the promising approaches for the handedness‐ selective synthesis of chiral soft materials with an optical and\n161 References\nmechanical function. In addition, the interconversion between enantiomeric chiral organizations in a reversible manner using orthogonal CPL or CPUL, or even turning off the photoinduced chiroptical properties by thermal treatment or using unpolarized light, is possible.\nMoreover, photochemical helical inversion is achieved with chiral liquid crystals and polymers based on intrinsically chiral photoresponsive dopants with a certain handedness, and it also photochemically switches to the other handedness by UV or visible light irradiation in a reversible manner. Molecules of opposite handedness simultaneously influence the orientation of the host molecules, and a subtle unbalance between the two handednesses determines the helicity of the system. An initial HTP and its switching upon photoisomerization of a chiral dopant in CLC significantly affect the modulating degree of the helical pitch including the length, handedness, and director orientation.\nOne of the innovative aspects of the presented works is that photoinduced chiral transition is realized, and also the chiral information is amplified and expressed at various scales, which offers a significant advantage of photo‐ mediated chiral materials and their applications for advanced photonics such as CPL‐utilized display, reflectors, optical storage, and chiral sensors, and for attaining macroscopic work.\nNevertheless, it should be remarked that precisely predicting which system would provide certain targeted chiroptical or mechanical properties still remains a challenge. The interplay of ongoing efforts to reveal the underlying principle linking molecular events and the macroscopic phenomena and to develop novel chiral functions from photochromic switches would pave the way to providing a general method for the development of chiral photoswitches and chiral supramolecules with tailor‐made functions."

      "text" : "Microfluidics, also known as lab‐on‐a‐chip (LOC) and micro‐total‐analysis‐ system (μTAS), cover a set of multidisciplinary technologies dealing with the manipulation of small amounts of liquids to perform reactions, analyses, or fun damental investigations in biology, physics, and at the interdisciplinary frontiers. In contrast to the conventional bulky bench‐top instruments and the associated manual methods to handle large amounts of biological and chemical reagents that are pretty time consuming and not so environmentally friendly, a fine con trol over the motion of continuous fluids or nano/picoliter‐sized discrete drop lets in microscale channels is beneficial in miniaturized systems. Therefore, there is a growing interest in downscaling the corresponding processes within LOCs and still retaining cost‐effectiveness and ease of fabrication. The microflu idic systems possess intrinsic features including minimized consumption of rea gents, portability, increased automation, reduced time, and cost efficiency, which make them particularly attractive from a wide range of laboratory and industrial perspectives.\nThe successful operations of microfluidic devices typically rely on electroki netic, mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic forces and are usually driven by exter nal transducers, such as pumps, valves, and electrodes. Recent developments of novel stimuli‐responsive soft materials (e.g., polymers, gels, and liquid crystals) in response to small variations of environmental conditions [1–4] provide an alternative choice and contribute to the rapid evolution of next‐generation LOCs by integrating different functionalities onto the same chip, which comprises not only tiny channels but also multiple microactuators with mechanical properties (e.g., micropumps, micromixers, and microvalves) or optical properties (e.g., microlenses). In the sophisticated microsystems toward automotive control of liquid motions, micropumps and micromixers are essential for fluidic handling,\nSoft Photoactuators in Microfluidics Lu‐Jian Chen1, and Quan Li2\n1 Xiamen University, Department of Electronic Engineering, College of Electronic Science and Technology, 422 Siming South Road, Xiamen, Fujian 361005, China 2 Kent State University, Liquid Crystal Institute and Chemical Physics Interdisciplinary Program, 1425 Lefton Esplanade, Kent, OH 44242, USA\n168 5 Soft Photoactuators in Microfluidics\nand microvalves are crucial for fluidic control. Less energy is required for the operation, and the dead volume is minimized through the elimination of inter connecting tubes between the functional components.\nIt is believed that the integration of microfluidic actuators using stimuli‐ responsive soft materials offers new possibilities to facilitate simplified designs of efficient chip configurations as a means of noncontact microfluidic flow control consequently, reducing the dimensions and complexity of the microfluidic plat forms. In general, most of the functional stimuli‐responsive soft materials respond to a set of physical, chemical, and biochemical stimuli ranging from temperature, pH value, light, electric and magnetic fields, and chemical analytes to biological components, and hence change their shape with respect to the con figuration or dimension to exert mechanical force on surrounding fluids. Among these external stimuli, light is particularly appealing for LOC applications as it can provide contactless spatial and temporal control, thus allowing the microflu idic functions to be integrated in geometrically confined environments [5–8]. It is noteworthy that low‐energy light stimulus could be biocompatible to elicit responses in biological systems.\nThe term “optofluidics” is engendered by anything that involves both light and fluidics. In this context, it is a new paradigm and relatively straightforward to con sider two specific processes: (i) light can manipulate fluids and (ii) fluids can manipulate light. As depicted in Figure 5.1, most of the direct strategies to convert the light energy into liquid motions by using optical forces (through radiation pres sure and optical tweezers) and light‐induced capillary forces (from a light‐induced wettability gradient and Marangoni effects) have been well categorized by Baigl [9]. Nevertheless, the former approach requires special optical setups, and the latter\n1695.2 Photoactive Soft Materials as Generic Microactuators\none is not practical because of the deficiencies such as short‐distance motion, local heating, and possible contamination problems.\nActually, a direct interaction between light and fluids is not necessarily required, thereby endowing the optofluidic devices with design flexibilities. To date, indirect interactions between light and fluids in microfluidics have been mostly mediated by means of photoactive functional soft materials that act as microactuators. Advanced LOC systems are integrated with these soft photoac tive components for pumping, mixing, and valving, as well as the fluid channels typically in microscale feature dimensions. Compared with the abovementioned direct light–fluids interactions, we would like to highlight that further opportu nities can be made available with the attempts that include and are not limited to the motion control of fluids by soft photoactuators.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview on the advances and trends of photoactive functional soft materials aiming at the design and fabrica tion of microactuators, also known as soft photoactuators. In doing this, we occasionally cover potential microsystems that might find microfluidic applica tions in the future although it is a developing area. From the point of view of material types and working principles, the chapter is organized into four major parts, corresponding to the main application scopes of soft photoactuators in microfluidics. The discussion on the photoactive soft materials as generic micro actuators in enclosed microfluidic channels is followed by the exploration of photoactive soft materials as optical microcomponents. Finally, we offer general conclusions and the perspective for future work at the end of this chapter."

Micropumps/micromixers and microvalves are essential microactuators to actively handle and control the fluid flow, respectively. The basic physical changes under stimulation are illustrated as follows: (i) change in mechanical properties, (ii) nonuniform strain generation, and (iii) change in volume. We review herein how to employ light to regulate liquid flow by using photoactive soft materials as generic microactuators, and discuss the general principles to improve the function and efficiency of LOC devices by soft photoactuators, thus offer intriguing possibilities in the facilitation of overall design of microfluidic systems. Microvalves are discussed first, followed by micropumps and micro mixers, since many micropumps could be built from a string of microvalves operated in sequence."

Obviously, hydrogels can be operated only in aqueous media, which is ideal for water‐based microflu idics. Existing studies of stimulus‐active bulk PHs suggest that these materials should be suitable for microfluidic applications. In contrast to the off‐chip mechanical valves, dimensions and complexity of microfluidic systems are greatly reduced by the use of hydrogels as on‐chip microvalves to enable the regulation of fluid flow in enclosed channels.

      "text" : "Poly(N‐isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAm) hydrogels are one of the most promi nent PHs that can show a temperature‐induced phase transition, relying on swelling and deswelling occurring at a certain, well‐defined temperature called the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 32 °C. The first demonstration of thermally actuated valves was realized in the mid‐1990s [11]. The potential use of pNIPAAm hydrogels as thermoreversible microactuators in LOC devices has been well explored as microvalves [12]. Above the LCST, pNIPAAm chains collapse (valve is open) while below the LCST they undergo a rapid and reversi ble entropy‐driven phase transition to extended hydrated chains that block the flow (valve is closed). It was also found that fluid flowing in Y‐shaped micro channels with one inlet and two outlets could be controlled directly by infrared (IR)‐laser‐heating‐induced local sol–gel transformation of the fluid containing the block copolymer of poly(N‐isopropylacrylamide‐co‐n‐butyl methacrylate) and poly(ethylene glycol) [13].\nThe straightforward approach of incorporating light‐absorbing photothermal nanoparticles or molecules [14–16] into a thermoresponsive hydrogel can also lead to structures with even faster swelling or shrinking rates by photoinduced heating [17, 18]. To achieve reversible changes in shape and size in response to different light wavelengths, Sershen et al. proposed two hydrogel systems with composites of thermoresponsive pNIPAAm and gold nanoparticles in the form of colloid and nanoshells, respectively [19]. The gold–colloid nanocomposite hydrogel collapses in response to green light, while the one with gold–nanoshell collapses in response to near‐infrared (NIR) light. The laser light irradiation in the range of 1.6–2.7 W cm−2 was converted into heat by nanoparticles. The heat‐ induced shrinkage of the pNIPAAm hydrogels resulted in the opening of micro valves. As shown in Figure 5.3, they demonstrated independent control of two nanocomposite hydrogel valves at a T‐junction within a microfluidic device by light irradiation with suitable wavelengths.\nThe photothermal deformation mechanisms involved in a thermoresponsive hydrogel with light‐absorbing nanoparticles were investigated theoretically when considering the equilibrium thermodynamics of a swelling gel through a variational approach; in addition, a case study in which the composite was employed as a microvalve was carried out to validate the numerical approach [20]. Lee et al. found that the light‐induced volume change of a hydrogel compos ite was maximized when the temperature of the medium was just below the LCST [21]. By copolymerization with hydrophobic N,N‐diethylacrylamide (NDEAm), the LCST of pNIPAAm could be lowered to maximize light‐induced volume change at room temperature. Knowing this relationship between light‐\ninduced volume changes and thermal behaviors, the light irradiation time could be minimized to achieve a desired volume decrease in the hydrogel.\nJadhav et al. demonstrated that a pNIPAAm hydrogel with polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles was used to achieve a photoresponsive microvalve for remote actuation with NIR laser irradiation for flow control in microfluidic devices [22]. As illustrated in Figure 5.4, the microvalve is based on in‐channel trapping of microgel particles, which undergoes volume change and enables on/off switch ing of localized fluid flow upon NIR light irradiation. The response rate and the “open” duration of the microvalve can be simply controlled by adjusting the laser power and exposure time. The trapped nanocomposite microgel can be trig gered to shrink sufficiently to open a channel within as low as approximately one to two seconds, while it swells to reseal the channel within approximately six to eight seconds. This feature allows speedy flow switching applications. They also employed soft actuators to control fluidic interface between laminar flow streams within a Y‐junction device.\nTwo‐dimensional (2D) materials with exceptional surface‐area‐to‐mass ratio are promising NIR photothermal candidates that can be loaded with high cargo concentrations [16, 23]. Lo et  al. demonstrated a pNIPAAm hydrogel incor porated with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA)‐functionalized graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite (GO–GMA) that underwent significant volume change in response to IR light irradiation [24]. The GO–GMA hydrogel carries a larger swelling ratio as well. In addition, the transition temperature is lowered by 10 °C due to the incorporation of GO. Zhu et al. reported a facile method to incorpo rate GO in pNIPAAm hydrogels by in situ γ‐irradiation‐assisted polymerization of an aqueous solution of N‐isopropylacrylamide and GO [25]. Chemically exfo liated MoS2 nanosheets were also successfully incorporated into pNIPAAm hydrogels by in situ polymerization [26]. Microvalves with excellent photother mal properties implementing such nanocomposite hydrogels with these 2D materials were fabricated to control the fluidic flow within the microchannel through remote NIR light actuation. The NIR‐light‐induced temperature change can be tuned effectively by variation of the GO doping concentration and the irradiation time.\n174 5 Soft Photoactuators in Microfluidics"

      "text" : "An alternative popular approach was implemented by copolymerization to cre ate photoactive PHs with covalent attachments between photochromic units and the polymer backbone. Only a few specific photochromic compounds that exhibit light‐induced isomerization have been investigated, such as azobenzenes and spiropyrans. Spiropyran derivatives are well‐known photochromes that can be reversibly isomerized between metastable states under light illuminations [27, 28]. In an acidic aqueous solution, the phenolate anion may be protonated in the dark, leading to a positively charged open‐ring merocyanine (McH) form, whereas visible‐light irradiation results in an effective photoisomerization of the open ring McH into closed‐ring spirocyclic (Sp) form. When the irradiation is stopped, the Sp form spontaneously converts back to the thermodynamically stable McH form. As shown in Figure 5.5, since the Sp is a highly hydrophobic molecule whereas McH is an ion and thus a more hydrophilic molecule, pNI PAAm hydrogels grafted with spirobenzopyran chromophore (pSPNIPAAm) undergo drastic light‐induced volume variation due to the hydration and dehy dration effects of the copolymer and solubility changes in aqueous solution. Consequently, pSPNIPAAm hydrogels can swell in the acidic aqueous solutions in the dark and rapidly shrink by visible light irradiation at room temperature. Notably, the volume change from Sp to McH is reversible in the dark.\nSugiura et  al. employed pSPNIPAAm hydrogels to fabricate microvalves in microfluidic systems [29], and on‐demand fluid flow systems constituting both arbitrarily rewritable microchannels and simultaneously controllable microv alves [30]. Blue light irradiation is applied locally to the discrete microvalves to induce the shrinkage of hydrogels, leading to the open state of each microv alve. The microvalve composed of pSPNIPAAm hydrogels can be opened by 18–30 seconds light irradiation. As shown in Figure 5.6, the unique noncontact programmed method facilitates the independent control of soft photoactive microvalves on one single chip.\nUnfortunately, the abovementioned light‐mediated opened microvalve based on pSPNIPAAm hydrogels requires more than one hour to swell and be closed again although it is inherently compatible with microfluidics. For practical pur poses, the valve is only for “one time” operation. It is believed that chemical mod ification of the pNIPAAm backbone is expected to optimize its response time. Chen et  al. found that the mechanical strength and the pressure tolerance of pNIPAAm‐based microvalves could be tuned by choosing a suitable amount of monomer and cross‐linker for the polymer monolith inside the microchannel [31]. IR‐light‐induced heating was provided by a quartz halogen illuminator. The microvalves can withstand leakage at pressures up to 93 bar and feature response times of opening and closing in the order of only a few seconds.\nAnother solution toward fast, reversible, and repeatable open/close operations is to modify the chemical nature of photochromic molecules. Schenning and coworkers demonstrated that molecular design of spiropyran derivatives is important to improve the isomerization speed and the reversible swelling/ shrinking behaviors of associated hydrogels [32] (Figure 5.7). Acrylic acid acts as a proton source in solution/polymer to stabilize the open‐ring hydrophilic McH form in the self‐protonating pNIPAAm hydrogel. These improved gel valves\nintegrated within microfluidic channels allow reversible and repeatable opera tion in minutes. Recently, Coleman et al. described a method for microfluidic flow control based on photoactive pSPNIPAAm valves with rapid and reversible actuation properties within practical timescales [33]. Application of pulsed light (450 nm) allows the valves to be held at an intermediate position for extended periods of time, resulting in a forced oscillation and control over the valve through photoisomerization of spiropyran between the McH and Sp forms. Varying the extent of light pulsing enables the instantaneous regulation of flow rate up to 0–27 μl min−1.\nRemarkably, a new concept in materials science is the incorporation of ionic liquids (ILs), organic salts that exhibit melting points below 100 °C, within poly mer gels to generate ionogels with the inherent advantages of ILs. Compared with an equivalent IL‐free hydrogel, the physical robustness of photoresponsive\nphosphonium‐based ionogels was improved [34]. Upon irradiation with visible light, the ionogels decreased in volume due to McH to Sp switching and the asso ciated loss of water from the polymer. These ionogels were then incorporated into a microfluidic device as photoactuated microvalves. A simple LED with a mild output of approximately 1 mW cm−2 can be used to actuate the microvalve. The swelling/shrinking properties can be controlled by alternating the anion of  the phosphonium ILs entrapped within the gel matrix [35]. As shown in\nFigure 5.8, the valve actuation time and liquid flow within each channel can be individually tuned, facilitating sequential actuation events under common illu mination conditions. Moreover, the microvalve fabricated by cross‐linked pNI PAAm ionogel can be reversibly actuated for up to eight times and resist pressures up to 1100 mbar [36]."

      "text" : "Micropumps and micromixers are essential components for fluidic handling. In general, an off‐chip micropump is connected to the microfluidic chip to intro duce liquid samples and facilitate the fluid flow. The integration of micropumps offers potentials in miniaturized microfluidic systems. The involved mecha nisms can be classified into two categories: (i) mechanical type, which includes electrostatic, piezoelectric, thermopneumatic, and electromagnetic effects, etc. or (ii) nonmechanical type, which includes magnetohydrodynamic, electrohy drodynamic, electro‐osmotic, electrowetting, electrochemical, and evaporation effects, etc. Even though impressive progress on numerous designs and materi als has been achieved to realize on‐chip micropumps, the lack of remote on/off switching capabilities limits their applications in microfluidics.\nRepeated light stimulus can be transformed into either mechanical or nonme chanical responses to pump fluids. It is found that light momentum can be trans ferred to trap and manipulate microscale‐sized particles, which are used as mobile elements to actuate liquids. Pioneered by Terray et al., time‐shared traps generated by optical tweezers were used to control the collective motion of col loidal particles inside microfluidic devices, working as a two‐lobe gear pump or as a peristaltic pump [37]. The advantage of this approach is that no specific microparticle fabrication is required, so that it offers a quite large versatility. However, the particles must be continuously trapped to avoid the contamination problem when being washed away by the flow.\nChen et al. proposed another mechanical micropump by the combination of an elastic pump membrane and a photodeformable liquid crystalline polymer\n(LCP) film [38]. The assembled structure of the prototype device is shown in Figure 5.9. The bending behavior of the LCP film is utilized to work against a fixed lid and induces pressure strokes on the flexible membrane and thus the pump chamber.\nAnother example of the application of soft photoactuators in miniaturized device is the self‐powered rechargeable micropumps developed by Patra et al. [39]. The micropump is based on the formation of a β‐cyclodextrin/trans‐ azobenzene complex [40]. The complex can be activated by two different mecha nisms, i.e. the trans–cis isomerization of azobenzene by ultraviolet (UV) light and the disassembly of association between cyclodextrin and azobenzene by introducing a competing guest molecule (adamantine, ADA). As shown in Figure 5.10, the light‐induced cis‐isomer of azobenzene has less binding affinity toward β‐cyclodextrin and hence gets dissociated from the cyclodextrin cavity.\nThis dissociation leads to changes in the local fluid density, which is provided as a possible reason for the self‐powered fluid flow in the gel. The gel could be reused when soaked in a solution of trans‐azobenzene or left in the solution for some time. In this manner, cis‐azobenzene turns into trans‐azobenzene and forms the β‐cyclodextrin/trans‐azobenzene complex again. The micropumps might be of great help in fluid handling and circulation of culture media for the development of organs‐on‐a‐chip devices.\nMicrofluidic paper‐based analytical devices (μPADs) are a type of innovative, low‐cost, equipment‐free analytical platforms due to impressive properties com prising flexibility, lightness, and low thickness. Nevertheless, the effective meth ods to handle and control fluids on paper are still limited. Akyazi et al. provided a new concept for fluid flow manipulation in μPADs by introducing ionogels as passive micropumps [41]. Two types of pNIPAAm ionogels, with different chem ical and physical properties, were drop‐casted at the inlet of the μPADs by a PDMS‐based ink‐stamping process. The delaying effect of the ionogels depends on the characteristics (chemical and dimensions) of the ionogel, which deter mine the swelling degree of the gel. As a proof of concept, the fluid delay capabil ity of the ionogel was tested on a Y‐shaped μPAD. Furthermore, they integrated a gasket to ensure the fabrication of negative passive pumps with different\n1815.2 Photoactive Soft Materials as Generic Microactuators\nvolumes of ionogel in a single μPAD [42]. The flow behavior of the μPADs can be modulated, redirected, and even reversed in the presence of an ionogel negative passive pump.\nMicrofluidic channels possess several characteristics, such as small overall volumes, laminar flow, and a large surface‐to‐volume ratio. Fluid flow in these microchannels is normally nonturbulent due to low Reynolds numbers. The mixing of confined liquids is critical yet challenging in most chemical and bio chemical processes. Passive mixers rely on diffusion or chaotic advection, while active mixers use the disturbance generated by an external field for the mixing process, and thus require external energy. Supplemental transducers such as pumps or electrodes were implemented in active mixers to enable dynamic and tunable mixing, thus increasing the complexity and fragility of the device while reducing its portability and flexibility.\nInspired by nature, a simple design of microactuators to facilitate pumping and mixing in microfluidic environments was adopted to mimic cilia, which are the greatest natural boon to living organisms; through them, organisms can manipu late, sense, and control their surrounding flow [43–45]. Artificial cilia driven by light have a promising future. van Oosten et al. used reactive liquid crystal mon omer inks in combination with the self‐assembling properties of an LCP to pro duce light‐driven artificial cilia by an inkjet‐printing process [46]. In order to remotely control the movement of the artificial cilia, they chose to use the pho tomechanical effect already developed using azobenzene‐containing liquid crys talline elastomers (LCEs). Microactuators created with different subunits can be selectively addressed remotely, thus allowing well‐controlled motions that have the potential to be more effective in mixing. Clearly, such a reversible photome chanical actuation requires a switching operation of dual wavelengths, which are not viable for many practical applications with a fast response. To improve the performance of LCE‐based photoactuators, Yang et al. proposed a robust strat egy for in situ grafting of graphene‐enabled LCE nanocomposites with superior and tunable photodeformable properties upon NIR irradiation [47]. In this NIR‐ actuated system, graphene sheets play an important role as a photoactive con stituent. The LCEs exhibit two distinct advantages, i.e. the self‐organization of LCs and the entropy‐driven elasticity that enables larger reversible deformations compared to conventional polymeric materials. The actuator performances, including deformation amplitude, actuation stress, and response rate, can be readily controlled by tailoring the quality, the loading content, and the degree of alignment of graphene in the LCE matrix.\nOverall, there are still plenty of microscale‐responsive polymer systems that have not yet been but can be utilized as soft photoactuators and find applica tions in microfluidics [48]. Among these potential systems, LCPs have been the major subject of ongoing scientific research [49, 50]. The underlying principle is that the mesogens act as an anisotropic solvent for the isotropic polymer chains. A delicate interplay of the effects of surface‐induced ordering, elastic strain of LCs, and topological defects is involved in the study of LCP systems. Therefore, LCPs can undergo several forms of macroscopic shape deformations, including contraction (expansion), bending (unbending), twisting, and other complex forms, dictated by the change of molecular order from the aligned state under\n182 5 Soft Photoactuators in Microfluidics\nexternal stimuli [51]. Since stimuli such as heat and light are easily attainable, thermo‐driven or photo‐driven LCP actuators are a promising class of soft materials that exhibit a number of intriguing properties. We believe that the aforementioned approaches discussed in this section may extend the perspec tives of the microfluidic systems for future applications when complex mixing processes and remote controllability are required, in particular for biological applications."

      "text" : "High‐throughput emulsification and de‐emulsification are an important concern for droplet‐based microfluidics. The interface between two immiscible liquids is increased and fragmented by mechanical actuation and hydrodynamic shear forces to generate microdroplets. For a given fluid composition and an appropri ate channel junction geometry, droplet size and frequency are controllable by varying flow rates. Generally, surfactants are used to stabilize microdroplets, and also account for many valuable rheological proprieties of the emulsion system. Similarly to the previous fluid mixing operation, the surfactant‐dependent strat egies to merge droplets can also be passive and active.\nWith the development of optofluidics, there is a need to explore new approaches to achieve the aforementioned microfluidic actuations by using light as a non contact stimulus. However, only a few light‐triggerable processes have been reported to mix a multiphase flow in microchannels or to realize photoactive emulsification and de‐emulsification.\nDiguet et al. reported an intriguing method to induce reversible switches from a continuous two‐phase laminar flow to a droplet‐generating regime with a usual water‐in‐oil (W/O) flow‐focusing geometry, by introducing a photosensitive surfactant in the aqueous phase [52]. The chemical structure of the cationic pho tosensitive surfactant azobenzene trimethylammonium bromide (AzoTAB) is shown in Figure 5.11. The isomerization of trans‐AzoTAB to cis configuration upon UV illumination results in a more polar tail. As a result, the interfacial energy between liquids and the channel is modulated, leading to the fragmenta tion of the liquid into an emulsion with monodisperse droplets. The system can go back to the laminar regime as the light irradiation stops.\nLater, Venancio‐Marques et al. described the reversible control of microfluidic mixing based on the light‐induced generation of W/O emulsion with water droplets, acting as reversible stirrers to mix two oil phase flows containing sam ples (Figure  5.12) [53]. Two continuous oil phases and a photosensitive water phase are injected in a flow‐focusing device. The AzoTAB molecule dissolved in the water phase is responsible for the photoisomerization‐induced change of wetting properties. Many cycles of reversible transitions between a nonmixing behavior and full homogenization of the two oil phases were demonstrated with the aid of light. Nurdin et  al. reported a new dual flow‐focusing microfluidic device configuration to generate stable dual jet and dual drop regimes [54]. After introducing the AzoTAB surfactant, the flow regimes were found to be depend ent on illumination conditions. The range of flow rates was identified where the\nflow regime could be dynamically and reversibly switched upon UV illumination at 365 nm. The two phases were well separated and never mixed in the absence of illumination.\nRecently, Takahashi et al. reported the photoinduced de‐mulsification of emul sions with a photoresponsive gemini surfactant (C7‐azo‐C7) bearing an azoben zene skeleton as a spacer [55]. Light‐induced isomerization of the azobenzene spacer allows reversible conversion between the trans isomer and the cis isomer. The modification of the interfacial tension leads to controlled coalescence. However, the de‐mulsification experiment was carried out for the overall emul sion without spatial differentiation. The several minutes of irradiation time that is required is considered to be too slow for microfluidic applications, where a response in the sub‐second range is more suitable.\nDunkel et  al. explored another light‐controlled merging approach by the irreversible photolysis of photosensitive surfactants (Figure  5.13). The amino quinoline (AQ)‐derived photosensitive surfactants is composed of polyethylene glycol/perfluorinated polyether (PEG/PFPE) diblock amphiphiles [56]. The light‐induced partial or total depletion of surfactants result in increased surface tension that would be equilibrated by the uptake of extra surfactants either from the bulk or from a neighboring droplet in oil‐in‐water (O/W) emulsions. The destabilization may lead to coalescence of droplets if the surfactant concentra tion goes below the threshold of critical value. Photolysis of microdroplets by using 355 nm picosecond‐pulsed laser light results in rapid, controlled fusion of vicinal droplets. Since the photolysis can be controlled precisely by adjusting the power, exposition time, and spot size of the laser beam, the method offers a new prospect of microdroplet merging with high stereospatial integrity in microfluidics."

Although these methods are effective to provide\ncontactless, spatial, and temporal control, several drawbacks still exist. For instance, the wettability gradients induced by light might be too small to conquer the contact line pinning in these cases. The Marangoni effect requires either local heating or addition of photosensitive surfactants into liquids, which limits their potential biomedical application because of contamination problems. In practice, simple and straightforward techniques are required to realize high‐ speed fluid transportation over long distances.\nInspired by the lamellar structure of artery walls, Lv et  al. proposed a con ceptually novel way to control fluid motion by capillary force arising from pho toinduced asymmetric deformation, instead of the aforementioned wettability gradients and Marangoni effect [57]. Robust tubular microactuators (TMAs) were prepared from a newly designed linear LCP (LLCP) that has a long flexible backbone containing double bonds and azobenzene moieties in side chains act ing as both mesogens and photoresponsive groups. As shown in Figure 5.14, the asymmetric geometry change of the TMA from cylindrical to conical is induced upon attenuated 470 nm light irradiation with intensity gradient along the long axis of the TMA. The photoinduced reorientation of LLCP results in a decrease in the thickness of the TMA wall and an elongation of the perimeter of the TMA, which together cause an increase in the cross‐sectional area of the TMA. By this means, the motion of a fully wetting liquid slug confined in the TMA microchan nel can be driven by light. The TMAs show unique abilities to propel not only common liquids spanning a broad range of polarity, but also complex fluids widely used in biomedical and chemical engineering. Furthermore, efficient liq uid mixing and the capture and movement of microspheres on the microscale in the photodeformable TMA can be triggered by external light, offering a versatile toolbox in microfluidic fields of microreactors, LOCs, and micro‐optomechani cal systems."

      "text" : "The last range of soft photoactuators relies on the use of light stimuli to control, tune, and reconfigure optical microcomponents in microfluidics. As we know, optical microcomponents, typically fabricated by micromolding or photo lithographic processes, play a crucial role in imaging and display technology, biosensing, beam shaping, optical switching, wavefront analysis, and device miniaturization. Toward both industrial and academic pursuits with regard to  enhanced light manipulation capabilities of optical systems, tunable micro lenses are employed as responsive in‐line, phase‐modulating, intensity‐ preserving microcomponents. However, most of these microlens designs can only operate with fixed focal lengths, relatively large diameters, and/or slow focal length switching speeds. Currently, considerable research interests have been focused on the development of novel material systems with soft microstructures. Benefiting from the use of photoactive soft materials, the microlens array has the potential to allow for dynamically tunable focal lengths without mechanical parts. Notably, the focal length of an individual microlens can be addressed on demand and inde pendently of other lenses. And the fabrication technology is facile, inexpensive, and scalable. In contrast to traditional optical systems, a higher degree of integra tion of optical micro com ponents with microfluidics can be anticipated, repre senting an enabling technology for a new class of tunable optical microcomponents for adaptive optics, imaging devices, or sensors.\n1875.3 Soft Photoactuators as Optical Microcomponents"

      "text" : "Hydrogel‐based lensing materials can be dynamically reshaped through various external stimuli after the optical elements are formed. Kim et  al. presented a simple wet‐chemical method to fabricate microlens arrays, which comprised of fast‐responding, reversible, photoactive hydrogel elements [58]. Glass substrates were functionalized by 3‐aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS), Au nano particles (16 ± 1.6 nm), and the cationic polyelectrolyte poly(allylamine hydro chloride) (PAH) subsequently. Then, anionic pNIPAAm‐co‐AAc microgels were attached to the APTMS‐Au‐PAH‐modified substrate through electrostatic inter actions. In this manner, colloidal Au nanoparticles allowed for local heating of the sample through excitation of surface plasmon modes. Figure 5.15 shows a schematic depiction and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of this construction, in which the laser‐power‐dependent lensing ability and the appar ent response time relate to the photothermal properties of Au nanoparticles and the thermoresponsivity of microgel lens elements. The unique micro‐optical characteristics also include the ability to spatially confine the tunable region to the single‐microlens scale with the aid of pulsed laser.\nIn another attractive demonstration as shown in Figure 5.16, Zeng and cow orker fabricated a liquid tunable microlens actuated by multiple micropost struc tures of Au‐pNIPAAm nanocomposite hydrogels photopatterned around the lens aperture [59]. Benefitting from the heat converted from absorbed light by entrapped Au nanoparticles, the swelling state (expansion and contraction) of the hydrogel network was controlled. The curvature of a liquid–liquid interface forming the microlens at the aperture and its focal length were regulated in turn. The focal length of the microlens can be tuned from −17.4 to +8.0 ± 0.4 mm in seconds under IR irradiation. This approach paves a potential way to replace cur rent technology that uses mechanical or electrical signals and intrinsically inte grates such light‐controlled tunable microlenses into optofluidic systems."

      "text" : "As mentioned previously in Section 5.2.2, microfluidic emulsification is one of the most powerful and important techniques for mixing and dispersing immisci ble fluid compositions within a continuous liquid phase. Complex emulsions, including multiple emulsions and Janus droplets (with faces of differing chemis tries), are of growing interest, especially in dynamic micro‐optics.\nTaking advantage of the temperature‐sensitive miscibility of hydrocarbon, silicone, and fluorocarbon liquids, Zarzar et al. described a one‐step approach to fabricate complex emulsions with highly controllable and reconfigurable\nmorphologies after emulsification [60]. To endow these emulsions with photoac tivities, a photoresponsive surfactant consisting of an azobenzene moiety, which reversibly undergoes photoinduced isomerization between a more effective\n190 5 Soft Photoactuators in Microfluidics\ntrans configuration and a less effective cis configuration, was synthesized and used in combination with a nonionic fluorosurfactant Zonyl FS‐300 with suita ble concentrations. As shown in Figure 5.17, the rapid and reversible morpho logic switch of hexane‐perfluorohexane droplets, between double emulsion (encapsulated) and Janus states (two‐sided) or to invert states entirely, results from changes in the balance between interfacial tensions. Thus, the dynamic reconfiguration of droplet morphology was observed in response to UV (365 nm) and blue (470 ± 20 nm) light by varying the duration or intensity of light expo sure. This yields a general strategy to create a wide range of photoresponsive elements for abundant applications of emulsions.\nVery recently, Nagelberg et  al. produced stable bi‐phase emulsions with a highly uniform size distribution as tunable microlens arrays by glass‐capillary‐ based microfluidics [61]. Such complex droplets are composed of optically dis tinct, immiscible hydrocarbons, heptane (nHP = 1.387) or hexane (nHX = 1.375), and fluorocarbons FC‐770 (nFC = 1.27) in the aqueous phase (nW = 1.33). The\n1915.4 Summary and Outlook\nphotoactive emulsion can be dynamically reconfigured through light stimuli in the presence of an azo‐surfactant, thus showing different optical properties depending on the configuration. Double emulsions with higher refractive index (RI) core phase strongly focus light, while those with higher RI shell phase show strong light scattering. However, Janus droplets do not significantly disturb the light wavefront when the light propagates along the surface normal of the inter nal interface.\nThe RI contrasts between hydrocarbons, fluorocarbons, and water, as well as the curvature of each interface contribute to the focusing power of refractive optical elements. By adjusting the droplet’s interfacial tensions with the aqueous phase, the focal length of emulsion‐based microlens can be varied from ±3.5× the drop diameter to infinity. Therefore, a light‐controlled switch of the droplet morphology consequently results in a predictable variation of the droplets acting as converging lenses projecting real inverted images, or as diverging lenses form ing virtual upright images. It is also confirmed that microscale optical tunability of the droplets could be translated to observable differences in macro scopic appearance, which can be used for the creation of patterns and images. Additionally, two potential applications of the microlenses’ functionality were demonstrated to be integral in microscale imaging devices and light field display technology. As shown in Figure 5.18, this feature allows for the creation of micro scopic and macroscopic patterns with tunable contrast, which could form the basis for light field displays capable of creating 3D images and projecting variable information content into different directions."

      "text" : "Overviews of the photoactive soft materials, involving hydrogels, LCPs, and emulsions, have shown their unique microfluidic applications as photoactuators. Owing to the considerable scope of optofluidics, the related discussion in this chapter only focused on a few selected but significant topics. Basically, the struc ture and morphology changes of photoactuators are induced by light, thereby offering the on‐demand control and handling of fluids, as well as the manipula tion of light interactions. The mechanisms involved are also discussed in details. Until now, the practical implementations of light‐responsive soft materials with microfluidic functions are not satisfying and should be extended to broader aspects.\nFor instance, microscale channels have a high surface‐to‐volume ratio, leading to different characteristics from bulk volumes. The wettability change of micro channels based on photoactive soft materials can be used to modify the surface interactions and influence fluid movements. The trans–cis isomerization of azobenzene leads to large changes in wettability when the structures of a surface topography are in the micrometer size regime [62]. As stated before, spiropyran can also undergo a hydrophilicity change upon isomerization. Polymer surfaces functionalized with these organic molecules can be more hydrophilic or hydro phobic upon light exposure [63]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the integration of these polymer coatings with tunable wettability into microfluidic\n192 5 Soft Photoactuators in Microfluidics\nchannels was rarely reported to be based on photoswitchable surface topogra phies. In addition, pNIPAAm hydrogels are widely used as prototype actuators, which can be only responsive to light irradiations in the presence of aqueous solutions with relatively low ionic strength, significantly restricting the types of fluids that can be manipulated. Furthermore, the approaches to tune the flow control with intermediate states, rather than a simple stop/start function with these gel‐based microvalves, are appealing and need to be further explored.\nFortunately, recent advances and trends show the possibilities to fully exploit the benefits of light stimulus by taking advantage of molecular design and tailor ing, which enlighten the development of new soft material systems. From this point of view, it is reasonably expected that the interplay among four main areas within microfluidics, i.e. material properties, functions, integration, and applica tions, are worthy of being reinvestigated to realize enhanced performance as desired. Our specific emphasis herein is that the discovery of new conceptual soft photoactuators would pave a promising way and bridge the gap between remote‐controllable LOC devices and many fields such as biomedical and phar maceutical research, chemical reaction manifolds, and for chemical/bioanalysis, which is undoubtedly the primary objective of future optofluidics involving pho toactive functional dynamic materials and systems."

      "text" : "Micro‐robotics\n“Robot” is a term first introduced by the Czech writer Karel Capek in a science fiction play “R.U.R.” in 1920 [1]. Another science fiction writer (and scientist), Isaac Asimov (1920–1992), stated that “today’s science fiction is tomorrow’s sci ence fact.” After a century of evolution, this statement has become a reality when it comes to robots, which continue disrupting our ways of living as well as trig gering our imagination on what tomorrow’s technologies will look like. For sev eral decades, scientists and engineers have focused their efforts on perfecting the mechanics and electronics of conventional robotic devices, to build ever‐ more sophisticated, precise, and reliable functions with faster actuation speed. However, new challenges have risen recently, as the robots of tomorrow should, instead of serving merely as a labor alterative or automation tool, act autono mously and adapt their function to overcome unexpected obstacles without human intervention, and all this in a human‐friendly and safe manner. Reaching such beautiful visions may be beyond the capabilities of conventional hard‐ bodied machines.\nIn contrast to the hard‐bodied robots with rigid components, soft robots con stitute soft actuators and flexible joints and links that can offer additional degrees of freedom and further sophistication in robotic movements [2]. Soft robots can adapt to unpredictable obstacles, and they are capable of continuous actuation and shape change. A comparison between a rigid‐ and a soft‐gripping device is shown in Figure 6.1. The rigid gripper (Figure 6.1a) requires pre‐programming in order to precisely reach the target and to control the force exerted on it. The soft gripper, composed of pneumatic actuators made of soft silicone‐based polymer and controlled by air pressure [3], can bend and adapt to the curvature of the object. Without any precise programming, the device can autonomously adapt\nLiquid Crystal Polymer Networks and Elastomers for Light‐Fueled Robotics Hao Zeng, Markus Lahikainen, Owies M.

However, hurdles remain in the pathway of soft robots when approaching practi cal applications. For instance, invasive surgery and task execution at small scales require the soft robot to be miniaturized and controlled by a wireless energy source. Most of the present‐day soft robots comprise pneumatic actuators that rely on air/liquid tube powering, a concept which is extremely difficult to realize at the microscale.\nAs an alternative to pneumatic actuation, smart stimuli‐responsive materials [6] stand out as particularly promising. In such materials, the powering source required for the actuation can be decoupled from the robot body, and the device can be fueled remotely. Various stimuli‐responsive materials have been imple mented into micro‐robotics, using power supplies based on magnetic fields [7],\n1996.1 Photoactuation: A New Paradigm for Soft Micro‐robotics\nlight fields [8], and chemical reactions [9]. Among various energy sources, light stands out as particularly promising, because it is clean and tunable (in wave length, intensity, polarization), enabling sophisticated control with high spatial and temporal resolution. Light‐responsive smart materials can perform shape changes upon illumination (Figure  6.1c), thus paving way for miniaturized, remotely controlled soft‐robotic devices. The photoactuation process in these materials is typically triggered by molecular motors that, upon proper materials design, translate the molecular‐level movements into controlled actuation in the macroscopic scale [10]. This provokes a paradigm shift in soft robotics: the use of light‐responsiveness of the material itself to build up robotic actuators and sensors, resulting in a remotely controlled actuation strategy and miniaturiza tion of the entire system.\nLiquid crystal (LC) polymer networks and elastomers (herein, we refer to them as liquid crystal networks (LCNs), without making a distinction between elasto meric and glassy polymer networks), are synthetic cross‐linked polymer systems constituting liquid crystalline building blocks, or mesogens [11]. The inherent tendency of liquid crystalline materials to self‐assemble opens up the possibility to pre‐design the molecular orientation within the polymer network [12]. Importantly, this orientational order can be reversibly controlled (or even destroyed, to yield order–disorder transition) under external light stimuli, result ing in a shape change of the LCNs [13]. The most popular light‐driven molecular motors in LCNs are azobenzene derivatives that can undergo reversible trans‐to‐ cis isomerization upon irradiation with a proper wavelength, dictated by the chemical structure (Figure 6.1c) [14]. This molecular‐level shape change can be amplified in LCNs to trigger large and reversible macroscopic deformation. To quote Zentel, one of the pioneers of LCN research, “the integration of photoac tive mesogenic units (i.e. azobenzenes) into LCNs has given rise to remarkable results and is currently judged the most promising candidate for commercial applications” [15].\nLight‐driven, LCN‐based soft robotics has been a nascent research field in the past few years. From light‐controlled microscopic walkers to autonomous walking devices [16, 17], from swimmers in micrometer to centimeter length scales [18, 19] and from artificially manipulated grippers to intelligent autono mous gripping devices [5, 20], azobenzene‐driven light‐responsive systems serve as an important path to access small‐scale soft robotics (see the exam ples in Figure 6.1d,e), yielding imaginative results that are not achievable with other materials. In this chapter, we provide an up‐to‐date overview of light‐ fueled LCN robotics. We start by introducing the photoactuation mechanisms, making a comparison between photothermal and photochemical actuation strategies, which often times yield distinct actuation behavior and shape changes, introduced subsequently. We then move from photoactuation to light robotics and discuss the basic physics that a small‐scale LCN robot encoun ters, as the forces at the microscale are very different from our common every day experience. Finally, we will draw the historical outline for important light‐robotic achievements, and outline the future prospects of this exciting field of research.\n200 6 Liquid Crystal Polymer Networks and Elastomers for Light‐Fueled Robotics"

      "text" : "To obtain light‐fueled actuation, one must incorporate light‐sensitive elements, i.e. photoswitches (azobenzenes) or nanoscopic heat generators (dyes or nano particles), into the material [21]. Both serve to absorb the light and introduce disorder into the initially ordered polymer network. In an ordered LCN, the mesogens are aligned in directions specified during the fabrication process, and the polymer chains connecting the mesogens are elongated. Upon light‐induced order–disorder transition, the system loses this molecular order and becomes isotropic, and the polymer system adapts entropy‐driven random‐coil confor mation. The presence of cross‐links, in turn, ensures that the initial ordered state can be retained, and the process is reversible. During the phase transition, the volume of the structure is largely preserved. Therefore, the structure tends to contract along the molecular director (the direction in which the mesogens are aligned) and expand in the perpendicular direction(s), resulting in sometimes very pronounced macroscopic shape changes (especially in main‐chain LCNs) [12, 22]. This process is schematically illustrated in Figure 6.2a.\nFrom a chemical point of view, the methodologies to synthesize LCNs are often times divided into two classes, one utilizing polymeric and monomeric precursors (denoted as “Two‐step reaction” in Figure 6.2b) and the other utiliz ing monomeric precursors only (“One‐step reaction” in Figure 6.2b). These are extensively described in various review articles [12, 23], and we refer the reader to these sources for a more elaborate discussion. A prototype example of the two‐step reaction is given by the pioneering work of Finkelmann and coworkers, who, in the beginning of the 1980s, demonstrated a two‐step method for obtain ing highly ordered, elastomeric LCNs based on siloxane chemistry [24]. The pro cess is illustrated in Figure 6.2b, together with examples of the materials employed (Figure  6.2c). In the first step, the vinyl groups, reacting very fast, build up a weakly cross‐linked polysiloxane gel connected by non‐mesogenic cross‐linkers. A mechanical load is then applied, in order to align the mesogens and obtain uniform director orientation, after which a second cross‐linking step is applied to ensure the formation of the (nematic or smectic) polymer network [25]. The method yields monodomain alignment with high‐order parameter over a large area, which further translates into efficient macroscopic actuation [26, 27]. The first example of a photomechanical actuator, which was demonstrated in 2001, was fabricated using this methodology [27]. The main drawback is limited con trol over the molecular alignment within the polymer network. Through proper materials engineering, the two‐step method is amenable to complex thermome chanical actuation modes [28], but in vast majority of cases, simple uniaxial con traction–expansion is demonstrated.\nThe one‐step reaction, developed by Broer et al. [29, 30] is based on photopo lymerization of an LC monomer mixture, within the temperature range where it exhibits LC phase. The process often times leans on radical polymerization of acrylated monomers (Figure 6.2c), yet recently also other reactions such as thiol‐ ene polymerization, have been used [31, 32]. This method has one great advan tage compared to the previously described one: as the polymerization is conducted in the low‐viscosity monomeric state, techniques developed for LC\n202 6 Liquid Crystal Polymer Networks and Elastomers for Light‐Fueled Robotics\ndisplays (such as surface rubbing or photoalignment) can be adapted to control the molecular alignment prior to polymerization. As a result, the director orien tation can be spatially patterned with high resolution, and separately controlled at the two LCN surfaces to yield complex, pre‐programmed molecular alignment distributions within the polymer network [33]. This unique feature allows one to go beyond simple contraction/expansion or one‐dimensional bending deforma tions, and depending on the director distribution, LCNs with exactly the same composition may exhibit diverse actuation modes. The relation between the molecular alignment and the light‐induced shape change is further discussed in Section  6.3, after introducing photochemical and photothermal actuators and comparing their main differences."

      "heading" : "6.2.1 Photochemical Actuation",
      "text" : "Photochemical actuation of LCNs is triggered by photoswitchable molecules, which can undergo a reversible shape change upon photon absorption. The most popular photoswitches in the context of LCNs are photoisomerizable azoben zene derivatives [11, 34]. They are aromatic compounds, in which two phenyl rings are bridged by an azo (─N═N─) group. Their attractiveness is based on several features. First, a huge range of azobenzene derivatives with different acti vation wavelengths and photochemical properties can be relatively easily synthe sized. Secondly, the rod‐like trans‐azobenzenes (Figure 6.3a) are well miscible with LCs, often times exhibiting LC phases themselves. Therefore, they can be mixed with several LC systems without problems of macroscopic phase separa tion or crystallization. Finally, cis‐azobenzenes (Figure  6.3a), which are more globular in shape, are incompatible with LC phases, and tend to disrupt or desta bilize them [37]. When incorporated into LCNs, the molecular‐level trans–cis isomerization process (which gives rise to huge change in geometry, the length of the molecule changing from about 9.0 to 5.5 Å upon trans–cis isomerization) very efficiently modulates the molecular alignment within the polymer network, and triggers the photomechanical actuation through isothermal, photochemi cally induced order‐to‐disorder, or LC‐to‐isotropic, transition [34, 37].\nThe lifetime of the metastable cis‐azobenzene determines the stability of the deformed state of the LCN photoactuator. Depending on the chemical substitu tion, the cis‐lifetime can be controlled over a huge range, from sub‐milliseconds in tautomerizable push–pull azobenzenes [38] to months or even years in het erocyclic or ortho‐substituted azobenzenes [39, 40]. Using the latter, bi‐stable photoactuators that preserve the photodeformed shape at least for several days have been reported [41]. Importantly, however, when exposed to a wavelength that triggers the reverse cis–trans isomerization, the initial shape can be retained at will. Chemical substitution also plays an important role in tuning the activa tion wavelength of the azobenzenes, and there’s a thrust to replace conventional UV‐absorbing azobenzenes with ones absorbing in the visible wavelength range, an important goal especially in applications in sunlight‐energy harvesting and photobiology [42, 43].\nAzobenzene‐based photochemical actuators often times exhibit photoinduced bending as opposed to in‐plane photocontraction. This is due to the strong\nabsorption of the azobenzene moieties, which constrains the light penetration into the LCN and confines the isomerization‐induced loss in alignment order only to the surface of the films [35]. Therefore, the cis‐azobenzene concentration depends on the distance from the sample surface, which gives rise to nonuniform stress distribution across the thickness and bending toward the illumination source (Figure 6.3b). Interestingly, the light‐induced photochemical strain may display strongly nonlinear time response. This is because the trans–cis isomeri zation gives rise to significant spectral changes and reduction of the absorption coefficient at the pump (UV) wavelength. Thereby the LCN gradually “pho tobleaches,” which affects the equilibrium shape of the photodeformed actuator. The nonlinear dynamics has been theoretically studied by Corbett and Warner [44, 45], and it has been also experimentally observed in homogeneously aligned, strip‐like photochemical actuators (Figure 6.3c) [36, 46].\n204 6 Liquid Crystal Polymer Networks and Elastomers for Light‐Fueled Robotics"

      "heading" : "6.2.2 Photothermal Actuation",
      "text" : "Another route toward photoactuation in LCNs is to employ photothermal heating to induce phase transition of the material. The mechanism behind the photothermal actuation is straightforward: the LCN is loaded with organic dyes or nanoparticles that, upon photon absorption, convert the absorbed light energy into heat through non‐radiative thermal relaxation processes. This heat is transferred into the polymer environment, triggering the light‐induced order– disorder transition and the subsequent shape change of the LCN [21]. An example of photothermal heating in a strip‐like actuator is given in Figure 6.4a, where irradiation with green light gives rise to temperature increase from 23 to 43 °C and resultant deformation of the LCN actuator.\n2056.2 Photoactuation in LCNs\nAs the role of the photosensitive moieties incorporated into the LCN is merely to transfer the light energy into heat, a plethora of organic dyes and inorganic nanoparticles can be used for this purpose, some of which are shown in Figure  6.4. Azobenzenes with sufficiently short lifetime of the cis‐isomer or simultaneous activation of both trans–cis and cis–trans isomerization reactions are efficient photothermal heat generators, a feature that has been recently uti lized in various elegant photoactuator designs [16, 17, 48]. Broer and coworkers demonstrated that several non‐photoisomerizable organic dyes and photostabi lizers doped into the LCN serve the same purpose, and efficiently trigger the photothermal actuation [49]. The main requirement is that the dopants should be soluble in the LC mixture, which in most cases is not a problem because only a minor amount of the absorbers is enough to trigger significant photothermal heat generation. By proper dye selection, the LCN can be activated over the whole visible–near infrared (NIR) spectrum, rendering the photothermal effect suitable for human‐safe operation and biological applications where UV light should be avoided and the NIR wavelengths are particularly attractive [50]. By doping the LCN with several dyes, one can cover the whole sunlight spectrum, providing a pathway toward sunlight‐driven actuators and solar energy harvesting.\nThe second focal area in devising photothermally driven light‐fueled actuators is doping inorganic carbon‐based or metallic nanoparticles into the LCN [51]. The most prominent examples in this context are carbon nanotubes, which can be aligned along the direction of the LC mesogens [35], and actuated by both light and electric fields [52–56]. Another approach to utilize carbon nanomateri als is to incorporate graphene oxide flakes into a polymer environment to trigger the photothermal effect [57–59]. Gold nanoparticles are also an excellent alter native, due to the wealth of sizes and shapes (spheres, rods, stars, etc.) that can be synthesized, which in turn determine the plasmon resonance (and thereby the photothermal activation) wavelengths. Gold nanorods have been shown in some cases to self‐align along the LC director, giving rise to reconfigurable photome chanical movements of LCN films [60] or micropillar structures [61]. Despite the fact that only a minor amount of nanoinclusions is needed to bring about the light‐triggered shape change (in the order of 0.1 wt%) [62, 63], the main challenge in utilizing inorganic nanoparticles in LCNs is the poor miscibility, leading to deterioration in mechanical properties  [51], decrease in order parameter, and increased light scattering. Even if these problems can be addressed by proper surface functionalization of the nanoparticles to increase the compatibility between the nanoparticles and the LC polymer network, at present we foresee organic dyes as more promising candidates as photothermal agents in light‐ fueled LCN robotics."

Both mechanisms have their own strengths, and are likely to\n206 6 Liquid Crystal Polymer Networks and Elastomers for Light‐Fueled Robotics\nfind distinct use cases when devising light‐fueled robots. Herein we attempt to highlight their most important differences, and some of the characteristic fea tures of photochemical versus photothermal actuators are given in Table 6.1.\nFrom a chemical point of view, the main difference between photochemically and photothermally activated LCNs lies in the position of the active units within the polymer network. For efficient photochemical actuation, the azobenzenes should be covalently (or noncovalently) bonded, preferably as cross‐links within the polymer network. Conversely, photothermal agents can be simply doped into the polymer network to yield efficient photoactuation. Covalent bonding between the photothermal units and the polymer network may allow increasing the concentration of the former, but to the best of our knowledge, it has not been shown that the bonding would be important from the viewpoint of efficiency of actuation. Secondly, typical azobenzenes are activated using ultraviolet or deep blue light, the reverse cis–trans isomerization taking place upon irradiation within the 450–550 nm range. Efforts have been taken toward shifting the activa tion wavelength to the green [64, 65] or even NIR wavelengths (using up‐ converting nanoparticles) [66]; yet, examples on this are still but few. In terms of efficient photoactuation using “human‐friendly,” low‐intensity visible/NIR wave lengths, photothermal actuators seem superior compared to their photochemi cal counterparts. Thirdly, the concentration of the photoactive moieties may be very different in these two cases. Generally, it is thought that by increasing the amount of azobenzene within a photochemically actuated LCN matrix, one can generate larger absorption/strain gradients, thereby boosting the photoactua tion. In fact, the first examples of photoinduced bending reported by the Ikeda group solely used azobenzene moieties (as both cross‐links and side chains) to fabricate their actuators [67, 68]. Contrarily, photothermal actuators yield rapid actuation even if the dye concentration would only be in the range of a few mole percentage, which is enough to absorb majority of the incoming light [69].\nImportant distinctions between the photochemical and photothermal actuators can also be made from the physical perspective. The first is the actuation speed. For a photochemical actuator, although the molecular‐level photoisomerization\n2076.3 Diversity of Shape Changes in LCNs\nreaction occurs almost instantaneously upon irradiation, the macroscopic defor mation of the polymer network takes seconds or even minutes [34]. The slow response can be considered as a drawback, but on the other hand, long lifetime of cis‐isomer enables bi‐stable performance of the actuator (i.e. the deformed geometry being preserved when the excitation is ceased) [41]. Photothermal actuators deform rapidly, within milliseconds to seconds, depending on the heat capacity. However, the original shape is also retained rapidly once the irradiation is ceased and the actuator cools down. A clear advantage of photochemical actua tors is the ability to function in several environments, including aqueous media [70, 71]. This is not the case for photothermal actuators, since the process relies on heat conduction, and the thermal conductivity of water is 20 times higher than for air, thus efficiently reducing the temperature of the actuator in aqueous envi ronment [72]. This poses great challenges for photothermal actuation in liquids, at least using light intensity levels that would be practically useful. The third dif ference we would like to point out relates to the fact that the photochemical effect relies on absorption gradients, which (i) makes it challenging to yield in‐ plane photocontraction (as opposed to out‐of‐plane bending) and (ii) may be accompanied with nonlinear bending dynamics due to “photobleaching,” as described earlier [36]. Photothermal actuation in typical LCNs (thickness limited to tens of microns), where temperature is rapidly equilibrated, is dictated by molecular alignment distribution across the sample: splay alignment gives rise to out‐of‐plane bending (toward the planar‐oriented film surface) and planar align ment to photocontraction, whereas in photochemically driven systems both cases yield bending deformation.\nTo summarize this part, by perfecting the material composition (e.g. cross‐link density to determine the stiffness of the material; photoactive units to choose between photothermal or photochemical actuation, or utilize them synergisti cally), the molecular alignment within the LCN of desired thickness and the properties of the light field triggering the actuation process, efficient photoac tuation can be attained. What renders LCN robotics unique is the ability to obtain multiple deformation modes using the same material composition and the same stimuli, simply by controlling the molecular alignment within the LCN. Such “programmability” yields a huge diversity in the light‐induced shape changes, as will be demonstrated in Section 6.3."

This macroscopic deformation, arising from the change in molecular orientation, was firstly theoretically predicted by de Gennes [75], and experimentally demonstrated by Finkelmann et al. [24]. The degree of stimuli‐induced contraction depends on the type of monomer as well as on the properties of the polymer chains forming the network. Different polymeric architectures can be adopted, e.g. main‐chain, end‐on, and side‐on polymers, among which the main‐chain LCNs display the highest strains and active forces (Figure 6.5b) [11, 12]."

      "heading" : "6.3.2 Bending and Coiling",
      "text" : "Bending deformation is by far the most studied photoactuation mode in LCNs. What makes LCNs unique compared to other light‐responsive materials is the ability toward bending motion in a monolithic material, i.e. without using a bilayer‐construction strategy [76, 77], alike in bi‐metallic cantilevers. This can be obtained by programming the molecular alignment, or by implementing light‐ absorption gradients that result in unhomogeneous stresses across the actuator thickness [74]. The typical molecular‐alignment configurations used (in addi tion to the homogeneous planar and homeotropic alignments) are twisted align ment (in‐plane rotation of the director by 90° from one surface to the other) and splay alignment (gradually tilting the director from horizontal to vertical), as illustrated in Figure 6.6a, respectively. Both twisted and splay alignment can trig ger inhomogeneous inner stress across the film thickness when exposed to homogeneous stimuli, leading to contraction along n and expansion in the other directions, and bending toward the planar‐aligned surface (in strip geometry with twisted alignment, the bending is toward the direction where the director is parallel to the strip).\nIn order to observe pure bending deformation in splay‐aligned and twist‐ aligned LCNs, the angle between the director and cutting axis (the long axis of the strip), denoted here as ϕ, should be close to zero. If ϕ is nonzero, the splay and twisted alignments can give rise to coils and helicoids, depending on ϕ. It is reported that a twist‐aligned strip with high aspect ratio having ϕ = ±45° exhibits helicoidal deformation, whereas a wider one tends to coil [79]. The sign of ϕ dictates the handedness of the structure, and deviation from ±45° results in dif ferent pitch of the coiling. Making use of this chirality, Katsonis and coworkers demonstrated the fabrication of right‐handed and left‐handed spiral ribbons that, upon light illumination, could undergo complex light‐induced motions and perform work (Figure 6.6b) [78, 80, 81]."

Modes and Warner have theoretically predicted that if an azimuthally or radially aligned defect is adopted into an LCN, a flat film deforms out of plane, forming a cone or a saddle [82]. The existence of such a buckling deformation due to defect‐like molecular alignment was confirmed experimentally by Broer and coworkers and is presented in Figure 6.7 [83]. These pioneering studies have led to many follow‐ ups of inscribing defect structures onto LCN films by using different fabrication\ntechniques.

      "text" : "An elegant way of controlling the light‐induced shape changes in LCN films is to locally pattern the director alignment across the film area. To achieve this, pho toalignment is a powerful technique [86]. Photoalignment involves controlling the orientation of LC molecules by exposing a “command layer” with polarized light. The command layer contains light‐sensitive units such as azobenzenes that tend to orient perpendicular to the polarization of light, or photopolymers that give rise to LC alignment parallel to polarization [87]. Molecules in the com mand layer guide the orientation of the LC monomers. Thus, by spatially con trolling the light intensity or polarization, an arbitrary alignment profile can be patterned onto an LCN film [33]. In the following text we present some examples of such photoalignment patterning and the light‐induced shape changes obtained thereof.\nSchenning and coworkers reported an accordion‐shaped actuator by pat terning directors into four distinct orientation areas [88]. Each area consists of a 90° twist across the film thickness, however, exhibiting opposite twist direc tions in adjacent areas as shown in Figure  6.8a. Bending occurs under light illumination, while the alignment patterning ensures that the strip bends toward alternate directions in the adjacent regions, resembling an accordion.\nBroer and  coworkers patterned an array of defects onto an LCN film, which they carefully cut along some defect lines, thus obtaining a flat film with a series of apertures. Those apertures could be opened and closed in a reversible fashion under light irradiation [91]. White and coworkers used a scanning laser beam with controllable polarization to pattern a flat LCN film with a 3 ×  3 array of defect‐type alignment patterns, which deformed into pyramids upon\n212 6 Liquid Crystal Polymer Networks and Elastomers for Light‐Fueled Robotics\nheating (Figure  6.8b) [92]. This concept has been further optimized by the same group in several follow‐ups [93, 94]. Our group has used a commercial miniature laser projector to locally pattern the LCN alignment to obtain an octopus‐like actuator, able to bend its arms in opposite directions, as dictated by the alignment patterning (Figure 6.8c) [85].\nDespite all the significant advancements mentioned above, a major limitation associated with film‐like actuators is the restriction to two dimensions. Recently, this limitation has been overcome by introducing 3D printing in the context of LCNs [89, 90, 95]. Ware and coworkers demonstrated a 3D‐printed LCN where the LC alignment direction was controlled by the material flow through the nozzle. The structure could be efficiently actuated and reshaped through ther mal triggering (Figure  6.8d) [89]. 3D printing also provides access to tunable actuators with photonic/robotic functions, as shown by Sánchez‐Somolinos and coworkers who fabricated an adaptive lens by integrating a 3D‐printed LCN ring with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Figure 6.8e) [90]. These are but the first steps taken with 3D‐printable LCN structures, and we expect several other breakthroughs to follow in the near future."

      "text" : "We have discussed diverse photoactuation modes in LCNs, due to pre‐designed distribution of molecular alignment. But, the question is: how to proceed from actuation to robotics? In other words, how to build a light‐fueled device that can not only move its legs, but also walk? To answer this question, the interaction between the actuator and its environment must be considered, which is the scope of this section.\nIn order to understand the dynamics of small‐scale robots, it is important to examine the forces involved in the system. Although the physics remains the same for small‐scale objects and the ones acting at a macroscopic scale, the ratio between different forces and their contribution to the robotic actuation, can differ a lot. The forces that dominate depend highly on the characteristic length L of the object, a feature known as the scaling effect [96]. For example, the gravity force G and inertia are related to the entire volume of the object that scales with L3, while active forces Fa, such as the muscular strength of an animal and the light‐induced elastic force of an LCN robot, depend on the area, scaling with L2. The ratio between Fa and G thus scales with L−1, rendering the overall force strongly size‐dependent. For a human weighing 80 kg (~800 N), the maximum pushing force from the legs is about 2000 N. Thus the ratio between Fa and G is small, <3. For an LCN robot with dimensions of, say, 5 × 1 × 0.02 mm3, the gravi tational force is c. 1 μN (for a material with density of about 1.1 g cm−3) and the light‐driven elastic force can reach 2 mN ( cross‐section of 1 × 0.02 mm2, active stress pressure c. 100 kPa), corresponding to Fa/G > 1000. The different Fa/G ratios at the different size scales point out that the design concepts for achieving efficient movement are distinct at the microscopic and macroscopic scales. This is evident in natural systems: big mammals build up strong skeleton to support their weight on land, and use two or four limbs to be able to walk or run; small\n2136.4 Physics and Dynamics of Small‐Scale Robots\nanimals such as spiders or insets can easily jump over very long distances due to the minor role played by gravitation, yet they have evolved with four or six legs with specific gaits because of the enhanced adhesion at the microscale. Even the simplest type of motion – walking – requires very different strategies at different scales [97].\nWalking is locomotion at an interface, where a robot encounters forces, most notably adhesion and friction. Adhesion can be defined as the force required to separate two objects that are close together (a pull‐off force). At the micro scale, this force arises from a combination of van der Waals, capillary, and other forces. Van der Waals forces originate from fluctuating dipoles, being present in all materials [98]. They are only significant over very short distances (a few nanometers), thus being strongly affected by the contact area and sur face roughness. When liquid exists at the interface, the capillary force becomes important. This attractive force originates from the desire to minimize the liquid surface energy between the surfaces [99]. The estimation of friction f for a soft‐bodied micro‐robot becomes very tricky, since the classical equation f = μN (μ: friction coefficient, N: the normal force) does not properly describe the forces between soft materials. With negligible gravitation and enhanced adhesion, the friction depends highly on the material rigidity [100]. Upon light illumination, an LCN is softened, increasing the efficient contact area leading to a higher adhesion. Because of this, a microscopic walker gets easily stuck on the substrate, and cyclic shape change can no longer generate walking motion. Several methods have been developed to decrease the friction experienced by a walking LCN robot. For example, one can use additional elements (legs) made of rigid materials and with a conical tip to minimize the contact area. One may also isolate the soft body from the substrate, using, e.g. spacer parti cles or silicon oil.\nSwimming can be considered as locomotion in a homogeneous liquid medium. Also in this case, the interaction between the object (swimmer) and the sur rounding environment plays a significant role. The ratio between the inertial forces and the viscous forces is given by the Reynolds number [101], Re =  ρ vd/μ, where ρ and μ are the density and viscosity of the liquid, respectively, and ν and d the velocity and the characteristic size of the object. Since ν and d both depend linearly on L, Re scales with L2. Therefore, a gigantic whale in an ocean can reach an Re of 107, a typical fish usually has an Re around 1–10, and bacteria have an Re in the range of 10−5 [102]. A representation of the Reynolds numbers experi enced by different systems is given in Figure 6.9. For small‐scale LCN robots, using a micro‐swimmer demonstrated by Fischer’s group as an example (cylin drical structure, 1 mm in length and 200 μm in diameter, ν: ~1 μm s−1) [19], the Re is in the range of 10−4 in water, decreasing significantly, to 10−8 or so, in a viscous liquid such as glycerol.\nQualitatively, the swimming mechanics is governed by inertial forces for large Reynolds numbers, and when the Re is small, viscous forces dominate the motion. Clearly, LCN robots belong to the latter class. Quantitatively, for Re << 1, the flow of a fluid is described by the Stokes equation [101]:\n∇ = ∇ +P v ff 2\nwhere, Pf is the fluid pressure and f is the external force. The equation does not contain any inertial terms and it is fully time‐reversible. This implies that a per fect time‐reciprocal motion cannot create a net motion. Thus, in order to con struct an LCN‐based micro‐swimmer, a specific movement sequence must be chosen in actuation. Generally, in a nonreciprocal movement series, such as jellyfish type, travelling‐wave‐like, or spiral movement, is adopted [103].\nConcerning the energy and control in LCN micro‐robotics, a wireless approach by using a light field provides important advantages in delivering energy into the robotic system. The powering intensity typically ranges from few tens of milli watt per square centimeter (a non‐focused light‐emitting diode (LED) source), to >102 W cm−2 when focused laser beams are used. The speed of photothermal heating of an LCN robot is governed by its heat capacity C, i.e. a measured physi cal quantity that estimates how fast the heat loss/gain is conducted in the system. Generally, C scales with the volume (L3) of the object. Thus if the size decreases, the LCN robot exhibits a rapidly increasing speed in actuation. Examples are shown in two LCN robots constituting the same material: an inching walker with body length of 1 cm that deforms in few seconds, while a 100‐μm‐sized LCN robot undergoes complete shape change within only 30 ms [72].\nIn an LCN, the actuation force originates from the light‐responsive elastic force, which scales with the cross‐section (L2), while the mass scales with L3. As a consequence, the acceleration, a = F/m (a: acceleration, F: active force, and m: mass) scales with L−1 and the robot’s movement speed is boosted by decreasing its dimensions. This brings about some unusual characteristics of LCN micro‐ robots. Namely the light‐induced force exerted by it can be remarkably huge: a vortexed LCN can lift up a load 150 times heavier than its own weight [92], and a 1.8‐cm sized LCN “catapult” can launch a cotton ball with a speed of 30 cm s−1 [104]. The elastic force, assisted by mechanical snapping motion, can exceed the\n2156.5 A Historical Overview of Light‐Fueled Micro‐robots\nweight of the actuator, leading to a jumping motion [89]. At the microscopic scale, the jumping can be very pronounced: being stuck on a rough substrate (e.g. paper), once the elastic energy is released due to some random fluctuations, the robot can jump over a distance of tens of its body lengths [16]."

      "text" : "After the invention of LCNs, extensive research effort has been put to com prehend the diverse possibilities offered by this intriguing class of materials. Actuators with different chemical composition, responses to different stimuli, and with increased sensitivity, have been devised, to provide ever‐more sophisti cated control over their movements. At the same time, several fabrication tech niques such as photoalignment [92], direct laser writing [105], and 3D printing [89] have been perfected to create diverse forms of actuators capable of fascinat ing shape changes for robotic applications. The pathway from an actuator to a robot is rather long as the material design parameters have to be re‐thought, and the concepts taken from existing robots cannot be directly generalized to the context of LCN robots. Yet significant developments have been made over the past decade. Herein, we have collected the achievements we deem the most important in light‐fueled LCN devices that perform specific robotic functions. Most of the highlighted results, comprising, e.g. walkers, swimmers, and grip pers, are compiled in Figure 6.10, together with their publication years. This his torical timeline reveals a clear trend: since 2008, which marked the beginning of light‐fueled robotics as we define it, the field is drawing more and more atten tion, and has reached a booming phase in the past three years.\nIn 2008, Ikeda and co‐workers reported a ring‐like LCN motor that could per form rolling motion by irradiating the motor simultaneously with UV and visible light at different positions (Figure 6.10a) [106]. This motor served as a plastic belt to drive the motion of a pulley system, transferring light energy directly into per petual mechanical motion. This pioneering work has acted as a source of inspira tion for much of the light robotics research to follow. For example, in 2017 Broer and coworkers fabricated a light‐driven “windmill device,” converting light energy directly into rotating motion, obtaining rotation frequency of about 1 Hz (Figure 6.10p) [113]. An important feature of these achievements as compared to robots introduced later on is that the systems operate “autonomously,” producing continuous movement under stationary illumination.\nShortly after introducing the plastic motor, the Ikeda group devised a bilayer actuator by laminating a polyethylene film with the same LCN material [107]. Using such a hybrid actuator, several deformation modes such as robotic‐arm movement, were demonstrated. Combined with an asymmetric plastic substrate, the bilayer actuator experienced friction bias at the robot–ground interface, thereby being capable of inchworm‐like movement (Figure 6.10b). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of an LCN‐based walking robot. In 2013, Kohlmeyer and Chen reported a carbon‐nanotube‐doped LCN–polycarbonate bilayer actuator that could be driven with infrared illumination [108]. They devised a light‐driven inchworm capable of crawling up a surface at 50° inclination, assisted\n216 6 Liquid Crystal Polymer Networks and Elastomers for Light‐Fueled Robotics\nby ratcheted wood surface and asymmetric geometry of the polycarbonate (Figure 6.10c). In 2015, the Wiersma group presented the first microscopic LCN robot (Figure 6.10d) [16]. The robot was fabricated using direct laser writing, and was composed of photodeformable LCN body and conical polymer legs made of photo‐resin. The length of the robot was only 60 μm (less than the thickness of human hair), and it performed rotation, directional walking, and jumping, depend ing on the substrate conditions.\nThe above examples relied on temporal control of the light stimulus: the motion was driven by switching the light source on and off, which induced cyclic shape changes to the robot, while the pre‐patterned asymmetry gave rise\n(a) Alignment direction Vis\nUV\n0 s\n10 s 8 s\n0 s\nOff, 0 s\nCycle 1\nOn, 6 s\n30 s\nLight off Light on\nLight on Light on\n15 s\n22 s 6 s\n0.17 s\n0.33 s\n0.50 s\n0 s\n(b)\n(c)\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\nt = 0.00 s\nt = 0.13 s\n(d)\n(h) (p)\n0.52 s\nv\n(i) (j) 0 s 0.16 s 0.29 s\n3 s\n(e)\n(f)\n(g) (m)\n(o)\n(n)\n(k)\n(l)\n2176.5 A Historical Overview of Light‐Fueled Micro‐robots\nto  friction bias required for locomotion. Another approach toward light‐driven locomotion relies on spatial modulation of the light field. This was demonstrated in 2016 by Wasylczyk and coworkers, who devised a caterpillar‐ mimicking walker whose walking direction could be controlled by scanning a laser beam across the laser body (Figure 6.10e) [109]. In their device, the friction bias was not brought about by pre‐patterned structural asymmetry, but by the momen tum transfer from the scanned laser beam to the robot body, allowing locomo tion to both forward and backward directions. The same light actuation strategies (temporal versus spatial modulation of the light fields) can also be applied to realize swimming robots. In 2015, a hybrid LCN swimmer was reported by Yu and coworkers [18]. They connected an LCN element to a flexible flagellum, and temporally switched light‐actuation‐triggered cyclic flipping motion, mimicking the motion of a fish and propelling itself in water (Figure 6.10f ). In 2016, Fischer and coworkers reported a microscopic LCN swimmer driven by patterned light field obtained using a digital mirror array [19]. Similar to the laser scanning used for the caterpillar walker (Figure 6.10e), the modulated light field triggered trav elling‐wave deformation inside the LCN filament, enabling swimming motion in a high‐viscosity liquid (Figure 6.10g).\nThe fascinating story of walking light‐fueled robot continues, and the results published in 2016 and 2017 demonstrate, for example, a human‐friendly millimeter‐sized walker mimicking the inching motion of a caterpillar larva (Figure  6.10h) [4], and a spiral roller built in between two plastic wheels (Figure 6.10i) [110]. The most remarkable advancements of 2016 and 2017 relate to light‐driven robots capable of autonomous locomotion. In 2016, White and coworkers reported an LCN spiral ribbon that can roll over large distances under spatially and temporally stationary illumination (Figure  6.10j) [111]. In such a device, the upper part of the polymer tends to exhibit a larger twisting\nFigure 6.10 Historical development of light‐fueled LCN robots. (a) Light‐driven plastic motor.

The asymmetric deformation brings about dynamic strains that con tinuously deform the spiral geometry and give rise to a net twisting moment. In 2017, Broer and coworkers constructed a photothermally driven LCN confined between the walls of a two‐walled structure performing wave‐like oscillation under static illumination. They harnessed such an autonomous wave‐like oscil lation to achieve light‐fueled walking without any temporal or spatial modula tion of the light field (Figure 6.10k) [17].\nConsidering the light robots of tomorrow, the LCN walkers are likely to evolve toward fully automated movements. This is already happening, as the examples ranging from spatial (scanning the laser beam, pointing the illumination source at a specific location on the robot body) and temporal light modulation (switch ing the light source on and off ) to robots moving under stationary light fields demonstrate. Further, one may utilize yet another unique feature of LCNs, which is the coupling between the properties of the light field and the material shape changes. The light‐induced deformation can be dynamic, in the sense that it provides feedback to the original light field through changes in the light absorp tion, which in turn further modifies the deformation. This special feedback loop may provide a paradigm shift for “traditional light robotics” with structured light fields: just let the robot sense the illumination conditions and act autono mously based on the feedback received from the environment. In this context two examples are highlighted, one based on gripping devices and one on iris‐like devices. In 2010, Yu and coworkers realized a visible‐light‐controlled actuator based on an LCN–polyethylene bilayer structure [20]. They fabricated a grip ping device consisting of “hand,” “wrist,” and “arm,” by integrating photoactua tors into three segments, and demonstrating several photodeformation modes. This way, for the first time they demonstrated transportation of a micro‐object by a series of light illumination sequences exposing different parts of the robot (Figure  6.10l). About seven years later, another gripping device has been pro posed by Priimagi and coworkers, where the gripping action is triggered by opti cal feedback, without the need for human intervention (Figure 6.10m) [5]. The LCN actuator is fabricated onto the tip of an optical fiber, which emits light and forms a “field of view” to the front of the device. The gripping action only takes place when an object in the field of view reflects or scatters enough light to the LCN actuator, thereby “recognizing” and selecting different targets based on the optical feedback. A similar concept was used by Wiersma and coworkers, who fabricated a microscopic LCN hand that autonomously closes on hot particles, with the ability to recognize different colors [48]. The second example, the iris‐ like actuation, dates back to 2014 when Zappe and coworkers presented an LCN‐based iris device in which the aperture dimension could be tuned by elec tromagnetic heating (Figure 6.10n) [112]. To function like the human iris, the device was operated via a specific control circuit: the transmitted light intensity was measured with a photodetector, and the information was sent to the power ing source of the actuator, which in turn tuned the aperture size. In 2017, Priimagi and coworkers demonstrated an autonomous LCN‐based approach for an iris‐mimicking device acting without a control circuit. The device is made by using radial molecular alignment and a structure with 12 petals that are open in\n2196.6 Outlook\ndark conditions, and gradually close under light illumination, thereby control ling light transmission similarly to the human eye (Figure 6.10o) [69]. From the above examples, we can draw the conclusion that interplay between material properties and light fields results in autonomy, which may pave way toward small‐scale robots that not only mimic the movements of natural systems, but also their intelligence."

      "text" : "After decades of work toward comprehending and perfecting the chemical design and physical control of LCN actuators, the road is paved for a transition from photoactuation to light‐fueled robotics. It can be perceived that the time is ripe for taking LCN actuators toward robotic applications, as exemplified by the significant advancements taken during 2016 and 2017 (see Figure 6.10). What makes LCN photoactuators particularly attractive is their intrinsically dynamic light response: light absorption induces material shape change, while at the same time the deformed shape modifies the material absorption, thereby self‐ adjusting its own deformation. Such optical–mechanical feedback provides the LCN actu ators a very unique capacity, namely self‐regulation, which can be used to realize sophisticated, dynamic robots such as light‐driven oscillators and autonomous propellers and walkers. We can foresee such autonomous actuation, driven by dynamic light‐response in the material, to adopt a significant role in the design of future LCN robots.\nWithin the next years, significant breakthroughs can be anticipated in both fabrication technologies and materials design. Regarding the former, we espe cially point out the recently demonstrated 3D printing of LCNs, which we expect to yield monolithic, complex robotic structures with delicate motion control [89, 90, 95]. From the materials point of view, reconfigurable materials based on dynamic covalent bonds [114–116], actuators responding to multiple colors of light [117], and LCNs whose stiffness can be patterned [28, 118], are deemed particularly promising. Such studies pave way for adaptive LCN actuators, whose performance can be reprogrammed at will, and that respond not only to light, but to multiple stimuli (or distinctly to different colors).\nFinally, great efforts should be put into devising efficient robotic movement strategies. For movements at interfaces, controlling the interactions between the LCN device and the substrate (friction and adhesion) is the key, and the dream case would be if these interactions could be dynamically controlled to yield, e.g.  locomotion steering. For movements in homogeneous medium such as swimming, nonreciprocal actuation strategies should be further developed. Although LCN robotics is inspired by nature, it should strongly interface with soft‐robotic research conducted with more traditional materials. To put the opportunities offered by LCNs in next‐generation soft robots into broader soft robotics context [119], it is important that the LCN researchers outreach the whole soft‐robotics community, increasing the awareness on the unique features offered by these materials and finding the niche where LCNs offer a break through for the future.\n220 6 Liquid Crystal Polymer Networks and Elastomers for Light‐Fueled Robotics"

      "heading" : "7.1 Introduction to Liquid Crystals",
      "text" : "The liquid crystal (LC) phase can be generally attained either by the action of heat on a mesogen or by dissolving an amphiphilic compound into an appropri ate solvent [1–4]. It is also known as “mesophase,” which refers to the amalgama tion of the intermediate order and mobility of LC phases as compared to those of solids and liquids. The unique combination of facile mobility with the inter‐ and intramolecular order makes mesophases extremely sensitive to external stimuli such as thermal, mechanical, chemical, electrical, light, or magnetic fields. Chemically, these mesogens can be organic, organometallic, or inorganic in nature. The mesophases obtained by temperature variation are called thermotropic. Thermo dynamically stable mesophases that appear on both heating and cooling are termed enantiotropic, while the thermotropic mesophases that appear only on cooling are referred to as monotropic. On the other hand, LC phases formed by dissolving amphiphilic compounds in an appropriate solvent (under given concentration and temperature conditions) are known as lyotropic. Besides, there are some molecules that exhibit LC phases under the influence of both heat and solvent; such systems are referred to as amphotropic LCs. Lyotropic LC phases are frequently encountered in everyday life, and most importantly, life itself is critically based on such ordered fluids [5–8]. Despite the significance of lyotropic LCs, thermotropic LCs have claimed relatively greater attention, firstly because they are simple to realize and handle, and secondly because they serve as an important component in the fabrication of low‐power display devices. Notably, both kinds of LCs, in part, have facilitated our understanding of the supramo lecular chemistry driven by secondary interactions [5, 6]. The classification of mesogens and mesophases has always been a complicated task; this is because over the past three decades a rich variety of mesophases have been discovered\nLight‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals and Their Applications Ammathanadu S. Amrutha1, Ammathanadu S. Achalkumar1, and Quan Li2\n1 Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Department of Chemistry, Near Doul Gobinda Road, Amingaon, North Guwahati, Guwahati, 781039, India 2 Kent State University, Liquid Crystal Institute and Chemical Physics Interdisciplinary Program, 1425 Lefton Esplanade, Kent, OH 44242, USA\n228 7 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals and Their Applications\nthrough conventional, nonconventional, or new molecular architecture. None theless, some basic principles are followed to categorize them. First and fore most, as mentioned above, they are fundamentally classified as being either thermotropic or lyotropic given the fact that the method of their realization and therefore, the resulting mesomorphism differs significantly. In particular, the mode of mesophase formation in thermotropics is by the organization of the individual molecules in contrast to that in lyotropics wherein the constituent (solute) molecules firstly aggregate and these fine structures then form different mesophases that generally depend on the temperature and concentration. Besides, there are different ways to classify these materials; for example, in terms of their structure (into amphiphilic and non‐amphiphilic molecules); molecular shape (calamitic, discotic, banana mesogens, etc.); molecular size (as low‐ and high‐molecular weight compounds); and with respect to the type of mesophase formed (nematic, cholesteric, smectic, columnar, cubic mesophases, etc.). The work presented in this chapter focuses on thermotropic LCs and hence our dis cussion is restricted only to this topic .\nMost of the crystals on heating transform into the isotropic liquid phase by simultaneous loss of the long‐range positional and orientational orders. If the molecules possess a certain amount of shape anisotropy, then the loss in one, two, or three dimensions of long‐range translational order in the crystal may precede the complete breakdown of the long‐range orientational order. Such compounds may show a series of mesomorphic transitions into fluid states that exhibit varying degrees of the structural symmetries. The temperature at which the crystal transforms into the mesophase is called the melting point while that from the mesophase to the isotropic state is called the clearing point.\nMaterials displaying thermotropic LC property are mostly organic or metal‐ containing organic compounds. Among the enormous number of organic compounds known, only a small fraction shows this LC behavior. Such types of compounds usually comprise hard (rigid) and soft (flexible) regions. The aro matic cores and some nonaromatic cores account for the rigidity while paraffinic chains are the soft regions of the molecule. However, these two distinct parts are combined in a specific way so as to attain a particular anisotropic shape of the molecule. The mobility in these systems is provided by large amplitude motions associated with molecules or molecular segments, namely the flexible tails/ chains. The orientational order arises from the parallel alignment of anisometric molecules, while the positional order is predominantly the outcome of specific attractive forces and amphiphilic nature. Further, these interactions are also influenced by the presence of permanent dipole moments, their magnitude or the anisotropy of the molecular polarizability. Thus the anisotropic shape of the molecule plays a very important role in determining the formation and type of the LC phases.\nConventionally, rod‐like and disk‐shaped mesogens exhibit thermotropic mes omorphism; they are popularly known as calamitics and discotics respectively. For many years, it was believed that only long or rod‐shaped molecules could be mesogenic (Figure 7.1a). However, in 1977 Chandrasekhar et al., demonstrated that even disc‐like molecules (Figure  7.1b) such as benzene‐1,2,3,4,5,6‐hexayl hexaoctanoate display mesomorphism [9].\nIn the following section, a brief account on the general molecular structural features of rod‐like mesogens is presented. In rod‐like molecules, the axial dimension is larger than the radial one, while it is the other way round in discot ics. As shown in a general template of a rod‐like mesogen, RC1 and RC2 are the rigid cores that are often aromatic in nature but may also be alicyclic. These two cores are connected either directly through a covalent bond or via a linking unit L (e.g. ─COO─, ─CH2─CH2, ─CH═N─ and ─N═N─). The terminal substitu ents R and R′ are usually either alkyl or alkoxy chains. In many cases, one of the terminal units is a polar substituent such as CN, F, NCO, NCS, and NO2. In some special cases, the lateral units X and Y (e.g. F, Cl, CN, and CH3) are incorporated in the main molecular structure. Further, by employing rod‐like mesogenic seg ments, both the main chain and side chain liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) have been designed and synthesized [2]. In the main chain LCPs, several rod‐like ani sotropic segments (the repeating units) join axially to form a long chain (the back bone). In side chain LCPs, rod‐like mesogens are attached to the side of the poly mer backbone. Inclusion of molecular chirality in rod‐like molecules furnishes chiral LCs, which are known to exhibit various chiral structures [10].\nDriven by curiosity and also in a quest to obtain novel mesophases, a great deal of attention has been paid to the design and synthesis of several different novel molecular architectures wherein the anisometric shape deviates from the con ventional rod or disk forms [11–14]; they are collectively known as “nonconven tional liquid crystals.” A common feature of a majority of such materials is the structural contrast within a molecule i.e. these molecules are made up of chemi cally different molecular parts that are incompatible/immiscible with each other. Some of the important examples of nonconventional systems are oligomers, polycatenars, bent‐core molecules, polyhydroxy amphiphiles, octahedral com plexes, star‐shaped molecules, rod‐coil molecules, and dendrimers [2]. Based on the structural diversity or shape anisotropy and external stimuli such as tempera ture and pressure, a rich variety of LC phases have been observed. The structural differences between these phases are quite narrow and therefore the precise characterization of LC phases requires the use of different techniques such as polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X‐ray diffraction (XRD) . Other experimental techniques such as electro‐ optic measurements and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are also in use for the characterization of mesophases. In the following section, mes omorphism exhibited by conventional calamitic and discotic molecules will be\n230 7 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals and Their Applications\ndiscussed.

Depending on the substrate surface conditions, the N phase exhibits schlieren, marble‐type, and pseudoisotropic textures. In this phase, the constituent mole cules have no positional order but are on an average, oriented about a particular direction called the director, n. The molecular organization in the nematic phase is illustrated in Figure 7.2. Although the preferred direction of molecules varies from point to point in the medium, a uniformly aligned sample is optically uni axial (Nu) and birefringent. However, the biaxial modification of this phase Nb is also known [2]. Cholesteric mesophase is the chiral variant of the nematic meso phase and therefore it is also called the chiral nematic phase. It occurs in systems where the constituent molecules are chiral [10]. It can also be obtained by dop ing the nematic LC with optically active molecules. In these systems, there is a weak tendency for neighboring molecules to align at a slight angle to one another.\nThis leads the local director to form a helix (either right‐ or left‐handed depend ing on the molecular conformation) in space with a well‐defined pitch that is much longer than the size of a single molecule. The cholesteric state is illustrated in Figure  7.3a. This helical arrangement is responsible for the unique optical properties of the phase, such as selective reflection [18]. When plane‐polarized light interacts with this chiral macroscopic structure, its plane of polarization gets rotated along the helix direction. When the pitch of the helix corresponds to a wavelength falling in the visible region of the spectrum (~400–800 nm) the chiral mesophase is colored. Importantly, the pitch of the helix is sensitive to a small change in temperature, and therefore, also to the reflected wavelength. Furthermore, these helical structures can be untwisted by the application of an electric field, which drives the reorientation of the molecular axis along the field direction.

      "text" : "In some phases, the average molecular center of gravity is arranged in equidis tant planes, and hence in addition to orientational order, a positional order also exists, leading to a layered structure. Such phases are known as smectics (Sm) (Figure 7.2). Depending on the molecular arrangement within the layer and the extent of inter‐layer correlations, smectic mesophases are further classified into different types [19]. Fluidity of the layer is an essential characteristic of all smec tic phases. A more rigorous way to treat the layering arrangement is to consider a one‐dimensional mass density wave [20]. There are many different smectic LC phases discovered thus far. They are smectic A (SmA), smectic B (SmB, also known as hexatic B) (non‐tilted Sm phases), smectic C (SmC), smectic F (SmF), and smectic I (SmI) (tilted Sm phases). The chiral smectic mesophases are formed when the constituent molecules are chiral. There are chiral SmA, chiral smectic C (SmC*), chiral smectic I (SmI*), and chiral smectic F (SmF*) phases. The SmA and SmC phases and their chiral variants are the most commonly\n232 7 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals and Their Applications\nobserved and extensively investigated fluid phases. In the following section, the structural details of some of the important smectic phases have been discussed briefly.\nSmectic A (SmA) and Chiral SmA Phases In the smectic A phase, the director lies along the layer normal. The molecular packing within the layers is liquid‐like and has no long‐range positional correlation. Likewise, there is no correlation between the lateral positions of the molecules in successive layers. Similarly to biaxial nematic phase, SmA can also possess biaxial symmetry that has been termed the biaxial smectic A (SmAb) phase wherein the molecules are along the layer normal, but have an additional director in the plane of the layers.Although the chiral version of the smectic A phase (observed with optically active molecules) is structurally the same as that of achiral SmA, owing to molecular chirality the symmetry is reduced from D∞h to D∞. As a consequence, in the SmA phase, when an electric field is applied orthogonal to the layer normal direction there will be a coupling of the electroclinic susceptibility to the field and the long molecular axes of the molecules will tilt with respect to the layer planes. For relatively low applied fields, the tilt angle varies linearly with the field. This linear electro‐optic phenomenon is called the electroclinic effect [21]. Both SmA and chiral SmA phases exhibit characteristic focal‐conic texture in slides treated for planar orientation and a dark field of view in slides treated for homeotropic orientation.\nSmectic C (SmC) and  Chiral Smectic C (SmC*) Phases The smectic C phase differs from the SmA phase, in that the director of each layer is inclined at an angle to the layer normal and this angle is identical for all layers (Figure 7.2) [22]. While the SmA phase is generally optically uniaxial, the SmC phase is optically biaxial. The tilt angle in this phase has been shown to vary with temperature and it often increases monotonically with decreasing temperature. X‐ray studies indicate that the layer thickness in this phase is considerably less than the molecular length. The symmetry elements of this phase correspond to the point group C2h. In the chiral smectic C (SmC*) phase, which is formed by optically active molecules, a macroscopic helical arrangement of the molecules exist. The helix occurs as a result of a gradual change in the molecular tilt direction (n) from layer to layer, about an axis perpendicular to the layer planes (Figure 7.3b). Owing to the presence of chiral molecules, the SmC* phase has reduced C2 symmetry, which creates inequivalence in the dipole moment along the C2 axis normal to the tilt direction, resulting in spontaneous polarization (Ps) in each layer. However, the presence of helix averages out the Ps to zero [22]. Nevertheless, to obtain a macroscopic Ps (ferroelectric behavior) the helix can be unwound by surface interactions or by the application of an electric field [23]."

Chiral molecules prefer to pack in a certain manner, but such a structure cannot be adopted everywhere due to\n2337.2 Classification of Liquid Crystals\nmolecular constraints. Such a situation leads to the stabilization of frustrated phases [17, 18]. Examples include blue phases (BP) and twist grain boundary (TGB) phases, the structures of which are briefly described further.\nBlue Phases (BP) These are distinct thermodynamic phases that appear over a narrow temperature range between chiral nematic and isotropic liquid phases in short pitch (<5000 Å) chiral nematic LCs [10] that are usually single component optically active rod‐like mesogens or mixtures composed of achiral and optically active mesogens. Recently, they have been also reported to occur in discotics [24, 25] and LC dimers [26]. Three distinct blue phases have been identified, i.e. BPI, BPII, and BPIII that occur in the same order with increasing temperature. The naming of these phases as blue is due to their Bragg reflections in the blue wavelengths indicating a partially periodic structure with lattice parameters of several hundred nanometers. Bragg reflection studies indicate that BPI has a body‐ centered cubic lattice, BPII a simple cubic lattice, and BPIII is probably an amorphous one. The structure of the BPs involves a radial twist of the director called a double cylinder. However, this double twisted structure cannot extend perfectly into three‐dimensional space. The structure of BPIII is proposed with a spaghetti model having randomly oriented wriggling double twist cylinders, while geometrical models of cubic blue phases (BPI and BPII) consist of cubic networks of double twist cylinders separated by disclination lines [17]. Combined interpretation of various experimental investigations on the structure of these phases has revealed that the BPII phase has a simple cubic unit cell of lattice defects, while the BPI phase is body‐centered cubic, both with lattice parameters in the order of several hundred nanometers (the wavelength of visible light). The blue phases are thus optically isotropic, i.e. linear birefringence is absent. The optical texture of the cubic blue phases is quite characteristic, generally with a platelet texture. Amorphous BPIII is characterized by its foggy appearance.\nTwist Grain Boundary (TGB) Phases These phases usually appear at the transition from the SmA or SmC* phase to the N* or isotropic phase [10, 27]. For short pitch chiral materials, there can be a competition between the need for the molecules to form a helical structure due to their chiral packing requirements and the need for the phase to form a layered structure. Molecules overcome this frustration by forming the TGB phase that consists of blocks of smectic layers, the successive blocks being rotated by a constant angle to give a helical structure with helix axis orthogonal to the layer normal direction. Since the smectic layers cannot be continuously twisted, they are separated from one another by screw dislocations to form grain boundaries which themselves are periodic, leading to the presence of layering as well as helical twist. Further, depending upon whether the smectic blocks are of smectic A, smectic C, or smectic C*, three different types of TGB phases i.e. TGBA, TGBC, and TGBC* are possible [28] and are observed experimentally [27, 29, 30]. TGBA phase exhibits a filament texture on a homeotropically aligned slide, while the TGBC* phase exhibits an undulated filament on the same. A planar texture is noticed for TGBA, while a square grid pattern is noticed for TGBC* on planar alignment condition.\n234 7 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals and Their Applications"

In contrast to their calamitic counterparts, the short axis of the disk‐shaped mesogens orient along the direc tor (n) of the nematic phase. Hence the disks align perpendicular to the director. Consequently, they show negative birefringence. The nematic phase of disk‐ shaped molecules is usually not miscible with the nematic phase of rod‐shaped molecules. The symbol “N” is often used to denote the discotic nematic meso phase [1, 2]. Similarly discotic analogue of cholesteric phase, chiral discotic nematic (N*) mesophase also exists. The nematic columnar (NCol) phase is char acterized by a columnar stacking of the molecules over a short range. However, these columns do not form two‐dimensional (2D) lattice structures. They dis play a positional short‐range order and an orientational long‐range order. Similarly, the lateral nematic (NL) phase is built of aggregates formed by multi ple discotic mesogens.

      "text" : "As discussed in Section 7.1, the molecular shape anisotropy is the major factor accountable for the formation of LC phases [1, 2]. Traditionally, controlling the shape anisotropy was carried out by altering the chemical structure of the mole cules, which may stabilize/destabilize LC phases. While this has been a very pop ular method that has resulted in varieties of conventional and nonconventional LCs exhibiting rich mesophase behavior, the possibility to control the shape ani sotropy by a nonchemical external stimulus is challenging and appealing. Photoisomerization is one such method, where the change in the molecular shape is brought by the photoisomerization‐driven conformational change in response to light of a particular wavelength, known as “actinic light.” Photochemical path ways have the advantage of specificity and selectivity over thermal and catalytic methods that result in giving mixtures of energetically unstable isomers. Photo isomerization can be defined as a photochemical process leading to isomerization of a certain chemical entity, either by bond rotation, structural rearrangement, or atom/functional group‐transfer [31] in chemical compounds. Several classes of organic compounds like azobenzenes, chalcones, stilbenes, and alkenes are good examples of photoisomerizable molecular systems. These are also sometimes referred to as photochromic/photoactive/photoresponsive compounds. Several reviews on the topic of light‐driven phase transitions in LCs exist in literature [32–37].

They have been significantly used to bring about photoinduced phase transitions. This is due to the ability of azobenzenes to exhibit fast, efficient, and fully reversible photoisomerization, and to remain stable over a large number of isomerization cycles [32]. Therefore, most of the results discussed in this chapter are based on azobenzenes and their derivatives. The photoisomerization of azobenzene occurs between two geometric isomers, in the trans and cis forms, which are also known as E and Z forms, respectively (Figure 7.5). These two forms differ from each other with respect to the orienta tion of aryl groups substituted on the central ─N═N─ moiety. The E form, where the aryl groups are parallel to each other leading to an elongated molecular shape, is energetically more stable, as compared with the metastable Z form with a bent shape. These forms have different absorption spectra and dipole moment. The E form exhibits absorption maxima centered at around 350 nm (π–π* elec tronic transition) and another at around 440 nm (n–π* electronic transition).\nThe E‐azobenzene possesses a zero dipole moment, while the Z‐azobenzene is known to have a dipole moment of 3.1 D. These two forms are interconvertible by the use of actinic light. Usually, ultraviolet (UV) light (λ ≈ 350 nm) irradiation results in the E to Z transformation, which can be followed by the change in the absorption spectra of the compound. Interestingly, the shining of visible light (λ ≈ 440 nm) results in the spontaneous reversal to the original E form. However, heat can also drive the Z to E isomerization process, which is known as thermal back relaxation. Although light plays a major role in photoisomerization, the molecular constitution of the azobenzene derivative, temperature, and host envi ronment can also have a significant role. Azobenzene and its derivatives can be used as dopants. In addition, the azobenzene core can be efficiently tailored to obtain photoresponsive low molar mass and polymeric LCs. The methodology, wherein azobenzene and its derivatives are employed as dopants or as pendant moieties in a copolymer, provides a valuable opportunity to strategize different guest–host combinations, and thereby control various properties such as order parameter, birefringence, color, viscosity, and polarity of the resulting photore sponsive system.

In all these cases, the E form will be more compatible with the LC phase due to its elongated rod‐ like structure. However, the Z form is not favorable for the stabilization of the liquid crystallinity due to the reduced shape anisotropy and bent shape. As shown in Figure  7.6, the molecular length of the energy‐minimized structure of  the E isomer of 4,4′‐dipentylazobenzene obtained from CS Chemdraw 3D (version 12) program is 22 Å, while that of the Z isomer is 10.6 Å, which is less"

This combination of a drastic change in the shape and overall molecular length, in association with the high photochem ical stability of azobenzenes, makes them highly suitable candidates to bring about photoinduced phase transitions. In fact, the Z form due to its bent shape is incompatible with the LC phase and thus acts like an “impurity.” This destabi lizes the LC phase and hence the E to Z photoisomerization leads to a lowering of the transition temperature. For example, consider a material containing the azobenzene derivative exhibiting an N–I phase transition. If the UV irradiation is carried out in the nematic phase, it results in the gradual lowering of the N–I transition temperature. This is due to the increase of cis‐isomers, which desta bilizes the N phase and finally leads to a collapse of the isotropic phase at a lower temperature. It must be emphasized that this transition is photochemical in nature and not driven by a change in temperature and hence it is known as an isothermal phase transition. Further, the photoinduced phase transitions in LC materials generally employ one‐photon excitation of the azobenzene group. Nonetheless, recently, a photoinduced phase transition has been accomplished through two‐photon excitations [32–34]. Such two‐photon‐driven photoi somerization holds promise in controlling the location and spatial extent of photoinduced structural changes and is therefore important for optoelectronic and photonic applications.\nThe high contrast in the birefringence of the LC phase and dark field view of the isotropic phase can be easily followed with the help of POM and the pho toinduced isothermal N–I transition is easily visualized. For example, if the sam ple in the N phase placed between two crossed polarizers is irradiated with UV light at a certain region with the help of a mask, the region that is irradiated with the UV radiation undergoes photoinduced isothermal N–I transition and there fore appears dark indicating the isotropic phase. In comparison, the central masked portion, which is unirradiated, stays as such in the birefringent nematic state. LCs are a kind of elastic soft matter that are very sensitive; thus, if a small portion of LC molecules change their orientation in response to an external stimulus, the other LC molecules are induced to follow that change.

If the generated disor der is large enough, it leads to the formation of the isotropic phase domains at the irradiated sites, which appear as dark regions under POM (Figure 7.7). The zone of influence of the azobenzene molecules could become very large making the entire sample to undergo photoinduced N–I transition. It is interesting to note that if care is taken to block the light leakage, very sharp boundaries of the isotropic and nematic phases can be observed. Notably, if not illuminated with 450 nm light, it remains as such until the thermal back relaxation occurs [35, 36, 38]. Although the LC media is fluidic, the high nematic potential serves as a bar rier for the diffusion of Z isomers from the isotropic region to the unirradiated region. The sample used in the study is a host nematic LC mixture and an azobenzene derivative as a dopant (E7‐EPH mixture, Figure 7.8) [38].\nFurther, Prasad et al. showed that when they used LC dimers based on azoben zene derivatives, they observed that the photoinduced N–I transition was dependent critically on the length and parity (odd or even) of the flexible spacer. They observed a pronounced odd–even effect, with the even members of the series exhibiting higher clearing temperatures of the N phase, although the mag nitude of the alternation decreases on increasing the spacer length. This type of alternation is often observed with increasing length of the terminal chain in case of monomeric LC materials, but the magnitude of the effect is very large for the LC dimers. The observed behavior has been rationalized in terms of the overall molecular shape in its all‐trans conformation, i.e. the dimers with even parity for the spacer have a more elongated or rod‐like structure, while those with odd par ity possess a bent shape.\nThey have also investigated [38] the influence of the parity and length of the  flexible spacer of the photoactive LC dimers in a guest–host system (E7‐4AOmOA4) again for the photoinduced N–I transition. They reported a fascinating feature in this system: i.e. even when the guest azo dimers are present in a small concentration of ≈5 wt%, an odd–even spacer parity effect in a striking alternation of ΔT [=TNI(without UV) − ΔTNI(with UV)] is exhibited or a change in the magnitude of the photoinduced shift in the nematic to isotropic transition is\n240 7 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals and Their Applications\nobserved with respect to the spacer length of the 4AOmOA4 dimer. In other words, they observed that the spacer parity effect seen in the case of N–I transi tion temperature of azobenzene dimers was also extended when these dimers were doped in nematic host E7. It is interesting to note that such a large effect is seen despite the small concentration (≈5 wt%), which is due to the large confor mational change in the photoinduced isomerization. They explained these results through the equilibrium configuration of the dimer dopant molecules in their E and Z conformations using the MM2 module in CS Chem3D software (Figure 7.9). The findings were: (i) as expected, the E conformers of the even parity spacers have an elongated shape, while the ones with odd spacers have a significantly bent shape; (ii) a remarkable change in the shape was noticed for the Z conformer, with the even member exhibiting a “Z” shape and the odd member exhibiting a “C” shape; and (iii) the projected length l shows an alternation with m, the extent\n2417.3 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals\nof the alternation being much larger for the E conformers than for the Z conform ers. In other words, upon isomerization, the change in the effective molecular length is much larger for the even (1.87 nm for m = 4) member than for the odd (1.39 nm for m = 5) member. This greater change in the dimension of the even‐ membered molecules is the cause for the larger value of ΔT observed for them. Thus, by designing molecules with a suitable shape in the all‐trans conformation, it is possible to control the magnitude of the photoinduced shift in the transition temperature. Over the years the results obtained from various groups suggested that the photoinduced N–I transition depends on several aspects including the chemical nature of the photoactive molecule. This was even reported in one of the earlier reports on photoinduced N–I transition, where a small amount of azobenzene or its derivative, 4‐n‐butyl‐4′‐methoxyazobenzene (BMAB), was doped in a standard nematic LC, 4‐cyano‐4′‐n‐pentylbiphenyl (5CB) (Figures 7.10 and 7.11). These binary mixtures exhibited photo‐driven N–I transition and the trans–cis isomerization was found to be nearly linear with the reaction time. A parameter termed as amplification, specified by the authors was found to be superior for BMAB than for the unsubstituted azobenzene [39, 40]. In the past five decades, numerous single component low molecular weight/polymeric and guest–host nematic LCs exhibiting light‐driven N–I transition have been studied toward comprehending structure–property relationships [39–43].\nC5H11 CN\n5CB"

However, Prasad and Nair reported a novel example of a  photoinduced disorder‐to‐order transition, which is contrary to the gener ally  observed photoinduced order‐to‐disorder sequence. A photo‐controlled\nnanophase segregation mechanism is utilized to explain this transition from a re‐entrant nematic to a lamellar smectic A (SmA) phase (Figure 7.12b). They have observed that the speed of this transition is much slower than the nematic‐ to‐isotropic transition, which occurs within 500 ns as compared to the 10 ns taken for nematic to isotropic transition [44].\nThe host material used for the measurements was a 24 wt% mixture of 4‐ cyanophenyl‐4′‐octyloxybenzoate in 4‐octyloxy‐4′‐cyanobiphenyl. The photo active guest compound was p‐(p‐ethoxyphenylazo)phenyl hexanoate doped at a low concentration of 2.9 wt% to the host mixture. The transition temperatures of the resultant guest–host mixture are isotropic 80.6 °C, nematic 48.8 °C, and smectic A 34.8 °C re‐entrant nematic (I‐N‐SmA‐Nre). The notable feature of this mixture is the existence of the N phase both above and below the SmA phase; the\nlower temperature N phase is termed re‐entrant because of its reappearance on the temperature scale. When irradiated in the SmA and high‐temperature N phases, the material transforms into N and I phases respectively (ordered struc ture to disordered structure). This fact is in agreement with the results in the literature that suggest that UV irradiation can lead to a melting of the phase, or in other words, a transition to a less ordered state [45, 46]. But when the experi ment was done in the Nre phase, they observed a novel aspect, i.e. the transition of Nre phase to the SmA phase, i.e. to a more ordered state (Figure 7.13). This photoinduced effect, particularly in the Nre phase, can be explained with the help of photocontrolled nanophase segregation mechanism. The principle behind this nanophase segregation (see Figure 7.12b) is that when the UV radiation is absent the azo molecules are in their trans form, with a rod‐like shape and hence can be easily accommodated into the smectic layers. However, in the photoi somerized cis form, these molecules assume a bent shape, and thus get expelled from the layers and occupy the region between the layers. This shows up as an increase in the overall layer spacing value, as noted from XRD studies. It may be mentioned that in the UV irradiated state, no additional reflections, which may be expected to originate from the phase separated regions, have been seen. This is perhaps because of the low concentration of the photochromic molecules used."

      "text" : "In 1975, Meyer et al. showed that the tilted Sm LC phases composed of chiral molecules exhibit a spontaneous polarization [47]. However, in 1996, Niori et al. reported a ferroelectrically switchable B2 phase exhibited by an achiral system with bent‐core or banana‐shaped molecules [48]. The origin of the spontaneous polarization (Ps) is attributed to a combination of factors such as (i) the highly\npolar character of the molecules; (ii) their arrangement in layers with the dipoles pointing along a common direction within the layers; and (iii) a tilt of the mole cules with respect to the layer normal. These factors give rise to a chiral layer symmetry although the molecules themselves are achiral. The B2 phase is known to be antiferroelectric in nature. The doping of azobenzene derivatives in such B2 phase materials has shown changes in the magnitude of spontaneous polari zation [49]. The Ps values were measured before UV irradiation, after irradiation, and after switching OFF the radiation. UV radiation caused the decrease in the Ps values, and while switching OFF the radiation reversed and recovered the original Ps value. This can be explained as follows. The non‐photoactive bent‐ core molecules (PHDDB) (Figure 7.14) and the photoactive azo molecule coexist in a layer of B2 phase (Figure 7.15). Schematic arrangements of these molecules are shown later. The length of the PHDBB is more than the double of the azo molecule in its trans form. In the absence of UV radiation, the azobenzene deriv ative will be in its trans form with a rod‐like shape and will be arranged as shown in Figure 7.15a. When such molecules are arranged in pairs in a layer, they sup port the polar character of the smectic layer. On photoisomerization, they assume a bent shape (cis form) and due to the nanophase segregation they will be expelled and will occupy the region between the smectic layers (Figure 7.15b). This leads to an apparent increase in the volume of the system and thus to a reduction in the dipole moment/volume. Consequently, the measured Ps was found to be lower than the one obtained before UV illumination. X‐ray diffrac tion studies confirmed the increase in the layer spacing by 0.05 nm upon UV illumination. But this volume change of 1% is not sufficient to decrease the Ps to such an extent (Figure  7.15c). As an alternative, they proposed a mechanism\nwhere the azo molecules remain within the smectic layer (Figure 7.15d). Unlike for the host PHDDB molecules, the polar axis of the bent azo molecules within one layer could point in either direction compared to the polar axis of the smec tic layer. This antiferroelectric nature of such an arrangement leads to a decrease in the Ps values.\n2477.3 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals"

      "text" : "The photoisomerization of photoactive LCs decreases their clearing as well as mesophase–mesophase transition temperatures due to light‐induced disorder ing of the system [32, 34–36, 51]. In some cases, even the intensity of the POM lamp source is sufficient to bring about such phase transitions [52–54]. Examples of photoactive compounds [53, 55] showing such effects and exhibiting meso phases SmA and SmC*, TGB, and N* and BP are given in Figure 7.16. The shifts in the mesophase–mesophase transition temperatures are found to be depend ent on the illumination intensity and the sample thickness. This is obvious because the rate of conversion from trans to cis isomers depends on the penetra tion length of the incident light. Moreover, the photo‐modulation of the sponta neous polarization of the SmC* phase has been established for some of these\n248 7 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals and Their Applications\ncompounds [52]. Further, in one of such compounds (18A in Figure  7.16a), a continuous decrease in SmC* to TGBA (TGB phase having SmA blocks) the phase transition temperature was observed with increase in the UV light inten sity [54].\nIt is worth noting here that the photoinduced SmA–Cr phase transition has  been observed in supramolecular complexes formed by interacting 4‐n‐ alkoxybenzoic acids with the bifunctional acceptor 4,4′‐bipyridine via hydrogen bonding (Figure 7.16b) [33, 42]. Hence, a transition from the less ordered state to a high ordered state occurs upon light irradiation, which is, in fact, contrary to that generally observed in other photoinduced phase transitions where photoir radiation triggers a reduction in the ordering of the system.\nIt is interesting to note that the photoinduced generation of BPs or the inter conversion between different BPs or BPI phase transition has been observed in some mixtures consisting of different photoactive nematic hosts and photoin sensitive chiral components [58]. For example, when irradiating the N* phase of one of the mixtures with UV light (λ = 365 nm) light at ambient temperature, BPII was formed while heating; and BPI and BPII were stabilized during the cooling cycle. This was the first report on photoinduced generation of BPs. In another mixture, the photoinduced interconversion of BPs has been observed; that is, when BPI is exposed to UV light for a period of two, three, and four min utes, transitions to BPII, BPIII, and the isotropic phase occurs, respectively. Further, they have shown the modulation of the BP selective reflection with low levels of UV and visible light [58] in this study. The observed phenomena have been ascribed to the changes in refractive indices and helical pitch. In this con text, it is worth mentioning that a photoinduced deformation in the BP struc ture has been established in chiral LC mixtures consisting of an N* LC, chiral dopant (S811), and azobenzene compound namely, 4‐dodecyloxy‐4′‐methoxya zobenzene [59, 60]. Irradiating the BP phase with the 473 nm light, led to the deformation in the cubic unit cell with a concurrent shift in the photonic band gap (PBG).\nPhotoinduced effects on a smectic Q (SmQ) phase have been reported in a chiral azobenzene derivative (S,S)‐DCAB (Figure 7.16c). It is interesting to note that the SmQ phase with a chiral 3D architecture can be modulated with the help of light and such materials can be utilized in the construction of photocontrol lable switching devices. This compound exhibits two SmQ phases, where the first one is a low temperature one (SmQL), while the second one is a high tem perature one (SmQH). The SmQL on UV irradiation transforms to the SmQH phase; while the SmQH phase transforms to the isotropic phase on UV illumina tion. On switching off the UV light reverse transitions to the earlier phases occur. The photoisomerization of (S,S)‐DCAB is responsible for these phase transi tions [57].\nSeveral azobenzene containing chiral dimers (D4–D21, Figure 7.17), where the azobenzene is connected to cholesterol moiety through odd/even spacers have shown photoinduced phase transitions [41–43, 61]. The SmA–I (Figure 7.18a–c) and N*–I transitions were noted on irradiation of these materials with UV light (λ = 365 nm) [63]. A blue shift was noticed in the selective reflection wavelength of the N* phase, when it is exposed to UV light; however, the magnitude of the\nshift was found to be dependent on the irradiation energy, temperature, and the  length of alkyl tail of the azobenzene segment. The authors exploited this phenomenon in a rewritable full color image recording in photon mode [61] (Figure 7.18d). The shift in the selective reflection wavelength is attributed to cis‐isomers, which have lower absorption maxima. These photosensitive dimers with a dicholesteryl ester have also been employed as dopants to obtain a stable glassy N* state [41]. In these materials, irradiating the SmA phase with UV light (λ = 366 nm) leads to the N* phase and with continued illumination the N* phase collapses to the isotropic phase; thus, SmA–N* and N*–I transitions have been observed [42]. In another dimer, exhibiting SmC*, SmA, and N* phases, a direct photoinduced SmC*–I transition occurs without passing through other two phases [43]. The percentage of cis isomer required for SmC*–I, SmA–N*, and SmA–I transition were estimated with the help of HPLC to be 30%, 6%, and 19%, respectively.\nLi et al. synthesized two cholesterol appended azobenzene derivatives (1‐Me and 1‐Et, Figure 7.17 exhibiting cholesteric phase [62]. The compound 1‐Et was used as a chiral dopant in conventional nematic LC 5CB (achiral N–I transition at 35 °C); at the composition of 25% 1‐Et in 5CB, the mixture is homogeneously mixed and undergoes an N*–I transition temperature at 39.9 °C. UV irradiation at 365 nm for 10 seconds showed the photoinduced isothermal N*–I transition. Removal of UV light immediately leads to the reverse process of N* domain for mation from the isotropic phase appearing as droplet nucleation followed by coalescence. The reversion to the original polygonal fingerprint texture was reached within approximately two hours at room temperature in the dark (Figure 7.19).\nZhou et  al. showed the photoinduced reversible lattice deformation and transformation of a simple cubic soft lattice, i.e. blue phase II, in a chiral LC system to a helical superstructure, i.e. cholesteric LC (Figure 7.20) [63]. This is attained by doping an achiral photoresponsive molecular switch‐functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane nanocage (Azo‐POSS) into a chiral LC\nhost. Furthermore, a well‐defined conglomerate micro‐pattern composed of simple cubic soft lattice and helical superstructure, which is challenging to fab ricate in organic and inorganic crystalline materials, is produced using photo masking technology.\nA photoinduced reversible SmC*–N* phase transition under the influence of an applied electric field has been reported in mixtures consisting of an achiral smectic C (SmC) liquid crystal (4‐hexyloxyphenyl‐4‐octyloxybenzoate, HOPOOB), chiral dopant [4‐(methyl‐heptyloxycarbonyl)phenyl 4‐hexyloxyben zoate: S811], and azo‐ benzene derivative (4‐diethyl‐aminoazobenzene) as a dopant in 3–7 wt% concentration (Figure  7.21) [50]. The SmC* phase formed upon cooling the N* phase held under the influence of a DC electric field shows uniform unidirectional layer alignment in the entire region of the rubbed cell. Upon reversing the polarity of the electric field, the molecules tilt with respect to rubbing direction; further, the photoisomerization of this state gives rise to an N*\nphase where the molecules tend to orient along the rubbing direction and in the absence of UV light, the N*–SmC* phase transition occurs. This light‐assisted control of smectic phase alignment/switching, holds promise in fabricating LC display, optical memory, and grating devices.\nSupramolecularly halogen‐bonded LCs (Figure 7.22) were successfully fabri cated using azapyridine derivatives with molecular iodine or bromine. The exist ence of halogen–base interactions was confirmed by XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and SAXS results. Among these complexes, the supramolecular LC compounds with bromine were first prepared with high stability, indicating that the N…Br interaction is strong enough to form ordered mesophases in this system. The iodine‐bonded LCs showed reversibly photoinduced phase transition upon UV irradiation, similarly to other photoresponsive LC materials based on azoben zene derivatives reported earlier. However, such a photoinduced phase transition was not observed in brominated compounds [64].\n252 7 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals and Their Applications\n(a)\ntrans-Azo-POSS\ncis-Azo-POSS\nV is 532 nmU V\n36 5\nnm\n(i)\n(iv) (v) (vi)\n(vii) (viii) (ix)\n(ii) (iii)(b)\n(c) (i) (ii)\nTamaoki and coworker recently reported asymmetric chiral dimers containing cholesterol and azobenzene moieties connected through flexible alkylenedioxy bridges (Figure 7.23a). These dimers acted as photon‐mode chiral switches for reversible tuning of self‐assembled helical superstructures. The chiral switches were doped into nematic liquid crystals, resulting in an N* phase. Under irradia tion with UV light, photoisomerization of the azobenzene units led to unprece dented switching of the cholesteric pitch and helical twisting power (HTP, β), with a higher HTP found in the cis‐rich state (bent form) than in the trans‐state (rod form). They attributed this behavior to the elongated cybotactic smectic clusters disrupting the helical orientation of the molecules in the N* phase (Figure  7.23b). Their reversible decay and reassembly were evidenced upon\n254 7 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals and Their Applications\nCnH2n+1O N N N X - X\nX = I or Br, n = 6, 8, 10, 12, 14\n2557.3 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals\nsequential irradiation with UV and visible light, respectively. In addition to the photoisomerization of the azobenzene units, the odd/even parity of the alkylen edioxy linkers of the dimeric dopants also had a dramatic effect on the transi tions of the cybotactic smectic domains. On the basis of the large rotational reorganization of the cholesteric helix and HTP switching (Δβ/βini of up to 50%), they could control the macroscopic rotational motion of micron‐sized glass rods upon irradiating the surface of a cholesteric liquid crystal film featuring a polygo nal fingerprint texture using UV and visible light [65]."

      "text" : "Most of the photoinduced phase transitions reported involved calamitic meso phases, while very few reports are available with reference to discotic LCs [66]. This is surprising despite the reports on many photoactive DLCs [67–70]. Recently, Norikane et al. reported photoinduced Col‐isotropic phase transition in a macrocyclic compound containing three fused azobenzene mesogenic seg ments (Figure 7.24) [71]. Upon light irradiation, the room temperature Col phase of the compound transforms into isotropic liquid where nonplanar (bent) mole cules forms due to their E–Z isomerization destabilizing the stacking of the mol ecules in columns; this process is reversible due to thermal back relaxation and quite sensitive to even small fractions of Z‐isomer. Tanaka et al. reported triph enylene derivative with six 4‐tetradecyloxyazobenzene units connected through propylene‐ester linkages (1‐C14). This exhibited enantiotropic SmA and Colr mesophases due to the interchange of their shape from disk to rod‐like in response to temperature. Interestingly, the photo‐irradiation (λ = 365 nm) leads to the photoisomerization of azobenzene units from trans to cis forms. This results in isothermal phase transitions (Colr–SmA–I) as in the thermotropic ones, but with a certain decrease of phase transition temperatures. This serves as a first example, where the isothermal LC phase transitions are controlled by\nphoto‐irradiation among three phases (Colr, SmA, and Iso), which are also accompanied with the shape change of molecules between rod‐like and disk‐like (Figure 7.25) [72].\nCheng and coworkers reported polycatenar LCs containing two 1,3,4‐ thiadiazole rings interconnected by an azobenzene central linkage. The compound with two tetradecyloxy chains exhibited a photoinduced transition from SmC to I, while the corresponding tetracatenar showed a transition from Colh phase to isotropic phase. These transitions were found to be reversible upon visible light irradiation (Figure 7.26) [73]."

      "text" : "As discussed in the introduction section, when a chiral molecule is dissolved in an achiral nematic LC, its molecular chirality gets transferred to the nematic solvent, with the stabilization of N* LC capable of selective reflection according to Bragg’s law. The wavelength λ of the selective reflection is defined by λ = nP, where P is the pitch length of the helical structure and n is the average refractive index of the LC material. The ability of a chiral dopant to twist the N LC phase is defined as its HTP “β,” which is defined according to the equation: β = (Pc)−1, where c is either the weight concentration or the molar fraction of the chiral dopant. The isomerization upon photoirradiation can control the HTP and the helical pitch of the cholesteric phases, providing the tool for optical display addressing. Presently, the chiral dopants are used at high concentrations (≥20%) and they have twisting powers of β  < 15 μm−1. Further, the addition of chiral\ndopant in such a high amount will alter or destabilize the LC phase. As a solu tion, scientists started developing of a chiral azo benzene derivative with high HTP and good solubility in a nematic host. The helical twisting power of azobenzene switches was considerably enhanced by incorporation of axially chi ral binaphthyl moieties. Especially binaphthyldiamine‐based switches 67, 72, and 73 (Figure 7.27), represent a powerful system for optical switching of the N* pitch, as the high HTP values allow for color generation and switching without added chiral codopants [74, 75]. Furthermore, UV irradiation of an LC film doped with switch 73 (β = +37 μm−1) leads to a cholesteric phase of opposite helicity (β = −31 μm−1). Owing to the molecular switch having two azo linkages, UV irradiation leads to reversible trans–cis isomerization of azo configurations producing two other isomers containing one or two cis configurations, respec tively. The sequence of the photochemical switch of the three isomers is (trans, trans), (trans, cis), and (cis, cis). The reverse process from (cis, cis), (trans, cis),\n258 7 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals and Their Applications\nand (trans, trans) can occur thermally or photochemically with visible light irradiation.\nLi and coworkers reported the wide optical tuning of a PBG of a BP facilitated by an axially chiral azobenzene switch E,E‐67 (Figure 7.27) in a commercial LC mixture [75]. The resulting BP exhibited a light‐induced unprecedented reversi ble PBG tuning over the visible region across red, green, and blue wavelengths accompanied by a unique, not previously seen light‐induced isothermal phase transition from a BPII to a BPI phase, depending on irradiation time (Figure 7.28). The process of the light‐induced phase transition from BPII to BPI were verified with reference to a Kossel diffraction diagram [76]. The photoresponsive tempo ral behavior as a function of composition is also reported."

Azoxybenzene compounds are stable and can be formu lated into mixtures with wide LC phase ranges. It is therefore of interest to know whether the optical properties of azoxybenzene compounds differ from those of similar azobenzene materials, or whether their LC properties are affected con trarily due to trans–cis isomerization (Figure 7.29). The absorption spectra for the trans isomer of azoxybenzene compounds also have a strong absorption at similar wavelengths to azobenzene compounds, but lack the weak absorption peak around 440 nm. ZhK‐440 (NIOPIK) is a mixture of two‐thirds p‐n‐ butyl‐p‐ methoxyazoxybenzene and one‐third p‐n‐butyl‐p‐ heptanoylazoxybenzene. If the molecules are trans isomers, ZhK‐440 possesses a nematic LC phase from 0 to 70 °C. The transition temperature from the N LC phase to the isotropic liquid phase decreases if molecules change from trans isomers to cis isomers, even tually reaching room temperature and probably eliminating the LC phase com pletely. Authors opine that azoxybenzene compounds should be just as useful in  optical applications as are azobenzene compounds [78]. The same group also observed changes of the pitch (color) and optical anisotropy and also N*–I phase transition in response to light, when they doped ZhK‐440 to a cholesteric LC [77]."

The colorless ring‐closed spiro forms of spi ropyran can be transformed into the colored ring‐opened merocyanine form upon UV light irradiation. Its reverse process occurs thermally in the dark or photochemically by visible light irradiation (Figure 7.30). An exclusive feature of spiropyran is its significantly increased dipole moment after photoisomeriza tion from the ring‐closed spiropyran form to the ring‐opened charge‐separated zwitterionic merocyanine form. The physical and chemical properties of the\ntwo forms of spiropyran are specifically different; thus, the thermally reversible photochromic switching can be exploited for the construction of smart materi als. Since the geometric shape changes upon photoirradiation are not drastic and the initial and final isomeric states are more or less elongated, spiropyrans have been used in the development of photochromic LC materials. The phase transition behavior of mixtures of LCs and photochromic spiropyran deriva tives, induced by isomerization of the guest molecules, has been investigated. Two types of spiropyran derivatives were employed: normal spiropyrans that are stable in the closed form (spiropyran form, SPF) and open form (merocyanine form, MCF) stabilized derivatives. These spiropyran derivatives were doped into two LC compounds: 5CB and 4‐butoxyphenyl‐4‐ethylcyclohexanecarboxy late (ECH 204). SPF‐stabilized derivatives exhibited photoisomerization behav ior from SPF to MCF in LC media, which was accompanied by an isotropic to nematic phase transition of the mixtures. On the other hand, N–I phase transi tion of the mixtures was observed when the MCF‐stabilized spiropyran doped in both LCs was photoisomerized from MCF to SPF. The result was interpreted in terms of shape anisotropy of the guest molecule associated with each isomer of the spiropyrans [79].\nKosa et al. reported a class of naphthopyran‐based materials (Figure 7.31) that exhibit photoinduced conformational changes in molecular structure capable of yielding order‐increasing phase transitions [80]. Appropriate functionalization of the naphthopyran molecules leads to an exceedingly large order parameter in the open form, which results in a clear to strongly absorbing dichroic state. The increase in order with light exposure has profound implications in optics, pho tonics, lasing, and displays and will merit further consideration for applications\nin solar energy harvesting. The large photoinduced isotropic to nematic transi tion switches the transmission through the cell from clear to strongly absorbing and dichroic (Figure 7.32). The clear to dichroic transition has been long pursued in ophthalmic applications, such as polarized variable transmission lenses."

The research group of Schuster reported cholesteric LCs that do not show fatigue during light‐driven reversible pitch modulation with the use of chiral fulgide F1 as a dopant [81, 82]. The HTP values are different for the open form and closed form, which is the basis of light‐ driven pitch modulation in CLCs. Yokoyama and Sagisaka reported the N* pitch\nmodulation by using compound F2 as the light‐driven chiral dopant [83]. Further, they demonstrated light‐driven handedness inversion in a CLC by using a pho toinsensitive codopant with compound F2.

Accordingly, many such compounds have been used as chiral dopants for the induction of photore sponsive cholesteric LCs and to modulate their properties by photoirradiation.\nYarmolenko et al. designed and synthesized menthone derivative K1 (Figure 7.34) to study its behavior toward the induction of cholesteric LCs [85]. By linking the menthone moiety through an exocyclic C─C double bond, they rendered this chiral compound photoisomerizable. It was noticed that the E and Z isomers show sign inversion of their HTP values in nematic LC host 4‐methoxyben zylidene‐4′‐butylaniline (MBBA). The E isomer induced a left‐handed helix, while the Z isomer induced a right‐handed helix in the LC matrix. This behavior\nis attributed to the dramatic change in the molecular shape of the dopant upon irradiation with UV light (λ = 313 nm). Recently, Gvozdovskyy et al. used this dopant in combination with the photoinsensitive dopant R811 and observed light‐driven handedness inversion of the induced cholesteric LC fabricated from the nematic liquid crystal MLC6884 (Merck) [86, 87]. The observed helicity inversion is due to the interplay of the opposite HTP signs of the two chiral dopants in the nematic host. By taking advantage of this property, they demon strated optically controlled diffraction gratings and beam steering (Figure 7.35). By using CLC samples capable of handedness inversion, it was observed that a light beam could be steered in one or two directions in a single photoirradiation step. Krivoshey et al. studied light‐driven handedness inversion in CLCs contain ing the chiral unsaturated ketone K2 [88]. This dopant induced a left‐handed helix in 5CB and, upon irradiation with UV light (λ = 313 nm), the CLC under went helix inversion, thereby resulting in a right‐handed helical superstructure.\nLub et  al. designed and synthesized chiral dopants K3–K5 (Figure  7.34) based on methyl‐cyclohexanones and studied the effect of the position of the stereogenic center (i.e. methyl group) with respect to the carbonyl group on the CLC induction behavior in nematic host E7 [89]. They observed that the com pounds display a low HTP when the chiral center is moved away from the ketone group. However, these dopants were found to exhibit a change in the sign of the HTP upon photoisomerization with UV irradiation from the E form to the Z form in the E7 nematic host. Thus, these dopants enable handedness inversion of the induced CLCs. Although these and few other examples men tioning handedness inversion of helical mesophases do not exactly fall under photoinduced phase transition, such examples may enlighten the reader about the future possibilities. For more such examples, the reader could refer to a review article [90]."

The photocyclization of the dopant leads to the pitch variation of the N* LC and even the N* to nematic phase transition has been reported. These events are a result of the different HTPs of the open and closed forms of the chiral dopant. Similarly, compound D2 was used as a chiral light‐driven molecular switch in the induction of N* phase. Reversible photocontrol over the pitch of the induced N* LC was demonstrated through irradiation with UV and visible light. It was found that usually the open form showed higher HTP than the closed form. Similar tansitions from chiral nematic to nematic was reported by the Irie group by utilizing chiral dithienylcy clopentene‐based compounds as dopants [93–96]. Owing to good fatigue resist ance of the dopant, CLC to the nematic reversible transition could be repeated many times. The drawbacks of these dopants were lower HTP values.

However, the photochemical recovery of the SmA phase was achieved.\nAlkoxy cyano‐substituted diphenylbutadienes were found to be good candi dates for studying the molecular basis of photoinduced changes of cholesteric pitch lengths because they possess a rod‐shaped structure and transform into thermally stable bent Z isomers upon light irradiation [99]. Doping the glass‐ forming N* LC, dicholesteryl‐10,12‐docasadiynediote, with 1‐(alkoxyphenyly)‐ 4‐(cyanophenyl)buta‐1E,3E‐dienes (Figure  7.38b) resulted in a red shift in the wavelength of light reflected by the host CLC. The extent of the red shift was dependent on the concentration of the dopant, the temperature of the film, and also on the molecular length of the dopant. The photoisomerization of these dopants leads to a blue shift of the reflected light, allowing color tuning of the films over a large part of the visible region. The cholesteric pitch and hence the reflected light by these materials could be fixed in a glassy state by cooling them from their cholesteric temperatures to 0 °C. They reported that the dimesogenic liquid‐crystalline molecules (Figure 7.38b) [100] possessed glass‐forming prop erties (from the cholesterol moiety) and photochromic properties (from the butadiene moiety). Photoinduced cis–trans isomerization of the butadiene chromophore in these materials could be utilized to bring about an isothermal smectic to an N* phase transition. By photochemically controlling the cis–trans isomer ratio, they could tune the selective reflection color of the film over the entire visible region, and the color images thus generated could be freezed by converting them to glassy N* states by rapidly quenching the irradiated film to ~0 °C (Figure 7.39). Upon photoirradiation, the formation of the cis isomers\n2697.3 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals\ninitially destabilizes the SmA* phase, bringing about a reduction in the SmA*–N* phase transition temperature. With the increasing concentration of the cis iso mers, the pitch of the N* phase decreases, leading to a blue shift in its reflection band. At high cis concentrations, an isothermal N*–I phase transition occurs. The isotropization temperature was lowered by around 90 °C, which is substan tially larger than in any of the previous reports on photoresponsive LCs. Although the photogenerated cis isomers were thermally stable, they could be reverted photochemically. Thus, 266 nm photoirradiation of a film containing a mixture of the cis and trans isomers in the solid state resulted in nearly complete recovery of the all‐trans isomer. Using this procedure, the images recorded using 366 nm light could be erased by irradiating them with 266 nm laser light. The pitch of the N* phase of the trimesogenic derivatives containing two cholesterol terminal moieties linked to a central diphenylbutadiene chromophore (Figure 7.38c) [101] could also be continuously varied thermally and photochemically to tune the color of the film over the entire visible region, and the color images thus gener ated could be stabilized by converting them to glassy N* states."

      "text" : "Recently, plasmonic gold nanorods (GNRs) have attracted increasing attention especially in biomedical applications due to their appealing “photothermal effect,” i.e. converting NIR light into heat through a non‐radiative relaxation process of longitudinal surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) [102]. It is also note worthy in this context that the characteristic wavelength of the LSPR signal cor responding to NIR absorption can be expediently tuned on demand by suitably altering the aspect ratio of GNRs [103], and therefore GNRs have been proposed for use in a few triggering systems where UV or visible light is not favorable [104]. However, adequate and homogeneous dispersion of conventional GNRs into a complex LC medium with self‐organized 3D photonic superstructures has always been a challenging task due to their poor miscibility in LCs and destabi lization of the 3D lattices. Li and coworkers reported an NIR‐light‐responsive self‐organized 3D photonic superstructure that was fabricated by incorporat ing new hydrophobic mesogen‐functionalized GNRs (M‐GNRs) into a BP LC medium composed of commercially available components (Figure 7.40a) [105]. The introduction of M‐GNRs was found to be beneficial in stabilizing the cubic nanostructure. Importantly, the resultant 3D photonic nanostructures could be switched between body‐centered cubic and simple cubic symmetry under irra diation using an 808 nm NIR laser due to the significant photothermal effect of M‐GNRs. The reverse process occurs upon removal of the NIR laser irradiation. Furthermore, dynamic NIR‐light‐directed red, green, blue (RGB) reflections of the light‐driven 3D soft photonic crystals were demonstrated for the first time (Figure 7.40b,c).\nFurther, Li and coworkers also reported mesogen‐functionalized GNRs that were soluble in organic solvents and displayed the typical transverse surface plas mon resonance and LSPRs of GNRs (Figure 7.41a). The protected GNRs were homogeneously dispersible in a commercially available thermotropic nematic liquid crystal host E7. The homogeneous LC nanocomposites were found to\nundergo a reversible N–I phase transition within a few seconds upon NIR laser irradiation, resulting from the photothermal effect of the embedded plasmonic GNRs (Figure 7.41b) [106]. The nanocomposites with higher concentration of GNRs exhibited faster phase transitions.\n272 7 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals and Their Applications"

This holds great potential for real‐time image processing, phase conjugate mirrors, and other optical communication applica tions [107]. Photoresponsive polymeric LC as a holographic recording medium has been discovered to have good thermal stability of the stored information, high resolution, and storage capability. Moreover, a variety of low molar mass LCs [108–111] and LC/polymer composites [112, 113] have also been studied extensively in the context of both static and dynamic holographic gratings. The pioneering work in this direction was done by Wendorff ’s group, with the pro duction of holograms in LC copolymers containing azobenzene moieties and mesogenic groups [114–117].\nFollowing this, Ikeda and Tsutsumi [118] established the high potentials of N–I transition in optical image storage application by achieving fast photochemical change (200 μs) both in low molar mass (BMAB and 8AB8) and polymeric (PA6AB2) nematic LCs (Figure 7.15). In this report, the N phase of polymeric LCs, covered with a photomask, is subjected to photoinduced N–I transition. Here the light illuminated regions transform to the isotropic liquid phase, while the unexposed regions remain in the N phase. The sample was then taken to the glassy state that maintains the stored pattern, although a reverse isomerization (cis–trans) occurs, pointing to the fact that no phase transition takes place in the glassy environment. This feature has been ascribed to the fact that while the segmental motions of polymer chains are possible, no macroscopic ordering (necessary for the isotropic liquid state to return to the equilibrium N phase) is accomplished. Following this, different types of azobenzene–low molar mass LC composites [119, 120], azobenzene–polymeric LCs [121], polymeric LCs [122], and copolymers [123] have been synthesized and their performances were investigated."

      "text" : "Some nematogens possess the dual frequency feature, and this can be utilized to create an optical storage device. The N phase of such materials exhibits a crosso ver frequency “fc” at which the dielectric anisotropy (difference between the par allel and perpendicular values) changes its sign, from being positive for f < fc to negative for f > fc. Hence, upon application of an electric field, the molecules would experience opposing dielectric torque when the field frequency is below and above the crossover frequency. In other words, above a certain magnitude of the electric field (Freedericksz threshold), the director prefers to be aligned along or perpendicular to the electric field in the two cases, allowing the orientation (homeotropic/planar) to be controlled by the field itself, instead of being con trolled by surface forces. Such a switching of configuration can be achieved, by maintaining a constant frequency and by illuminating the sample with actinic\n2737.4 Applications of Light‐Driven Phase Transitions\nlight [124]. The principle behind such a device is the substantial increase in the dielectric relaxation frequency fR (and thus indirectly in the crossover frequency fc), induced by the radiation. These changes are connected with strong changes in the transmitted intensity of the LC cell. Thus this phenomenon can be exploited to fulfill a photonic addressable device in which the bright and dark states are achieved without allowing the material to transform to the isotropic phase, a highly desirable aspect particularly in view of enhancing the chemical stability of the LC substance employed."

      "text" : "The characteristics of LCs such as dielectric constant, magnetic constant, viscos ity, elasticity, and so on are hugely dependent on their alignment. Owing to their optical properties, LC materials can be used as actuators for light, which is the underpinning aspect for the modern LCD industry. When low molecular weight LC materials are placed in a cell and sandwiched between two transparent elec trodes (usually ITO) coated with alignment layers, an LC cell is obtained. Upon application of an electric field with a driving voltage between the two electrodes, these LCs in the cell change their alignment directions from parallel (homogene ous) to perpendicular (homeotropic) with respect to the conductive substrates. Since LC molecules can change the polarization direction of light to their optic axes when the linearly polarized light (LPL) passes through them, and its trans mittance through a pair of crossed polarizers, with the LC cell placed between them. A bright/dark contrast is produced at each electrically controlled pixel, and two‐dimensional images can be displayed in the flat panel of LCDs. Usually, unidirectionally rubbed polyimide layer is used on the electrodes to attain the alignment for liquid crystals. Although it is widely used it has some drawbacks like dust contamination and production of static charge during the rubbing pro cessing, which may lead to serious problems such as speckles and reduced dis play contrast of LCDs. Moreover, the rubbing method is limited to flat surfaces, which cannot be applied on curved substrates. Therefore, the noncontact method of photoalignment is considered to be one of the promising ways to solve the above‐mentioned problems and can be easily used to assemble LCDs with high quality, wide viewing angles and large‐area display.\nPhototuning of N* LCs are expected to be very important, as these can act as active media for reflection‐type displays, particularly if the wavelength of the reflected light is in the visible region. Such cholesteric LC materials have high potential for full‐color LCDs with high quality and extremely low energy con sumption. Further, the freezing of the cholesteric color by immobilizing the molecular ordering in a glassy state provides a way to achieve optical materials with a static function and for optical data storage [37]. Similarly, the ferroelectric LCs (FLCs), based on the helical SmC* phase, possess spontaneous polarization (Ps) and exhibit microsecond responses to the change in applied electric fields in a surface‐stabilized state (flip of polarization). If a flip of polarization of surface‐ stabilized FLCs (SSFLCs) can be photoinduced in the presence of an applied elec tric field, a photoresponse of FLCs in the microsecond time region can be obtained. Here, the bias voltage remains constant before and after photoirradiation, but the\n274 7 Light‐Driven Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals and Their Applications\nthreshold value for the flip of polarization is reduced by photoisomerization of the photoactive LCs. As a result, a flip of polarization is induced by photoirradiation, which leads to a change in alignment of the FLCs [125, 126]. A similar method was extended to antiferroelectric LCs too and already a device has been fabricated based on anti‐FLCs [127]."

      "text" : "Alteration of LC alignment by light not only induces an extreme change in refrac tive index, which is very difficult to achieve with amorphous materials, but also gives rise to some promising phenomena, e.g. photomechanical and photomo bile effects in liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs), molecular cooperative motion in low molecular weight LCs and LCPs, and supramolecular cooperative motion in LC block copolymers (LCBCs) [107].\nRecently, the photoinduced N to I transformation has been also used in devel oping soft actuators derived from LCEs. This provides a possibility of coupling between orientational order and mechanical properties in LCEs, which was ini tially predicted by de Gennes [128, 129]. This concept finds potential application in the development of artificial muscles and mechanically tunable optical ele ments [130]. Experimentally, this was supported by a spontaneous contraction along the director axis of the nematic LCE films upon heating toward the N–I transition [131]. Notably, the deformation in the shape up to the extent of 300% has been achieved in nematic LCE films derived from side chain siloxane poly mers [131]. Based on the concept of photomechanical effects of a polyamide‐ based monolayer [132], large and reversible light‐driven deformation of LCEs has been demonstrated. The motion of LCE films was controlled by the gradient of the cross‐linking density, polarization direction of actinic light, and the initial alignment of the LC molecules, etc. [133–135]. The occurrence of this photome chanical effect has been attributed to the decrease in the order parameter caused by trans–cis isomerization. An example, is the achievement of photoinduced three‐dimensional deformation of the azobenzene‐based nematic LCEs swollen in suitable solvents or heated above their Tg in air by Ikeda’s group [136–138]. They successfully developed a single film capable of repeatedly bending precisely along the guided direction [107, 137, 138]. Similarly, a number of investigations have been reported to show that the LCEs containing azobenzene moiety, in response to the illuminated light, exhibit extraordinary changes in shape and volume where the light energy directly gets transformed into mechanical energy. Photoswitchable ferroelectric LCEs have also been realized as alternate ways to control the shape changes through optical (by photoisomerization) as well as electric (Piezo effect) means in addition to the existing thermal path [139]."

Nature has been utilizing such photoinduced effects to perfection, as in the case of retinal protein rhodopsin, which enables vision. Scientists have been mimicking nature with the utilization of photosensitive organic molecules, which has resulted in a number of photoactive materials, for example, azoben zene or its derivatives. These photoactive materials are being utilized either in pure form or as a guest component in guest–host mixtures, to investigate their response to the light stimulus provided by the photoresponsive part and its effect on the whole system. In LC systems, a distinct variety of photoinduced phase transitions have been observed involving achiral as well as chiral materials, nematic, smectic, columnar, and blue phases. Thus, after a brief overview of LC systems, a detailed account of these photostimulated but isothermal transforma tions provided in this chapter illustrates their importance in both basic research and applied sciences.\nConsidering the fact that phase transition involving different mesophases or mesophase to isotropic phase leads to enormous changes in their optical proper ties, the usage of light to achieve such goals continues to be a captivating field for exploration. Since azobenzene systems are easily accessible, most of the studies are based on azobenzene‐derived LCs or dopants. In addition, several other sys tems such as diarylethenes, azoxybenzenes, diphenylbutadienes, spiropyrans, fulgides, and several axially chiral azo compounds have also been discussed. In recent years, the effects of parameters such as molecular conformation, surface fields, electric field, elevated pressure, anisotropy reducing component, and magnitude of orientational order on the photoinduced N–I transition have been well studied to give a new dimension to their technological potential. Similarly, dynamic self‐assembly of a layered phase induced and stabilized by light of a particular wavelength, tilt susceptibility of chiral smectic system, photoferroe lectric effects in an antiferroelectric LC, etc. emphasize the fact that actinic light can be used as a new tool to study phase transitions and the associated critical phenomena that could also bring about effects that are not seen in equilibrium situations. Most importantly, two applications originating from the photoi somerization, i.e. optical storage and photomechanical effect, have been well corroborated. In addition, these studies will motivate several non‐display appli cations of photoactive LC materials. With progress in the design of new pho tochromic molecules and photoinduced phase transitions, it can be expected that new technological advances and/or breakthroughs would occur in LC sci ence in the future."

      "text" : "Photomechanical materials can directly transform light energy into mechanical movements that provide mechanical devices with many advantages, such as non contact, remote control, and spatiotemporal resolution. In the past decades, a variety of photoresponsive materials have been developed, and the system based on liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) is one of the most fascinating ones from the viewpoint of applications as soft photoactuators [1–8]. However, a simple‐ component material system sometimes develops into a bottleneck, such as dif ficulty in the realization of multiwavelength responsiveness or the flexibility of fabrication. Recently, nanocomposite materials, which combine the superiority of both organic and inorganic materials, have shown more and more potential in photomechanical researches. It is necessary to summarize the recent progresses made with reference to photomechanical soft nanocomposites. In this chapter, we will mainly discuss their design strategy, fabrication, operating principle, and potential applications.\nBeing one of the outstanding candidates for stimuli‐responsive materials, some nanocomposites not only respond to light, but also to other stimuli, such as moisture [9–11], electric field [12, 13], magnetic field [14], temperature [15– 18], and chemical energy [19], and may also simultaneously respond to multi‐ stimuli [20–25]. Such photomechanical soft nanocomposites are usually made up of soft matrices and functional additives, which utilize the synergistic effect in each component and magnify the microcosmic molecular changes into macro cosmic device motions. The photo‐driven actuators originating from these soft nanocomposites have broader materials choices while performing multiple deformations under different light‐irradiation conditions. To interpret the data from researches made on photomechanical soft nanocom posites in a systematic way, their classification from different perspectives is\nPhotomechanical Soft Nanocomposites: Synergies Between Soft Matrix and Energy Conversion Additives Jing Hu1, Shudeng Ma1, Haifeng Yu1, and Quan Li2\n1 Peking University, Department of Material Science and Engineering, College of Engineering and Key Laboratory of Polymer Chemistry and Physics of Ministry of Education, No. 5 Yiheyuan Road, Beijing, 100871, China 2 Kent State University, Liquid Crystal Institute and Chemical Physics Interdisciplinary Program, 1425 Lefton Esplanade, Kent, OH 44242, USA\n286 8 Photomechanical Soft Nanocomposites\nsummarized, as shown in Table 8.1. From the perspective of fabricating a nano composite actuator, they can be mainly divided into two classes: homogeneously dispersed functional additives in soft matrix [26–45] and asymmetric assembly [46–51]; however, there must be a soft matrix to act as a structural foundation of the material system and functional additives to respond to the specific light‐ stimuli. Making sense of the working principle is essential; we can also classify the nanocomposite materials into photothermal actuators [38–42, 52] and pho tochemical actuators [53–58]. In some cases, the same system can be actuated by both the photoconversion mechanisms [30, 34, 59]. Moreover, if considering the nanocomposite actuators through their responsive light parameters, they can be sorted according to the differences of light wavelength, light polarization, light intensity distribution, light interference, and so on [60–63]. In this chapter, the second classification method is adopted to introduce the photomechanical soft nanocomposites, in the order of the nanocomposites actuated by photothermal effect, than the photochemical ones."

Several kinds of materials possess outstanding pho tothermal conversion efficiency, and the most commonly investigated photo\n2878.2 Photomechanical Nanocomposites Based on Photothermal Effect\nthermal conversion agents are noble metal nanostructures, such as gold (Au) nanoparticles, nanorods, nanoshells, hollow nanospheres and nanocages, as well as carbon materials including graphene, graphene oxide (GO), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [23, 64–69]. In addition, organic compounds such as indo cyanine green (ICG) dye and polyaniline, as well as copper chalcogenide semi conductors including CuS and Cu2‐xSe nanocrystals, are also reported for their excellent photothermal performances [70]. Among these photothermal conver sion agents, metal nanostructures exhibit close to the highest conversion effi ciency due to their intensive near‐infrared (NIR) absorption and tunable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [42, 70–74]. These photothermal materials have been widely used in solar energy harvesting, cancer photothermal therapy, drug deliv ery, and biomedical imaging. Recently, researchers of photomechanical materi als have become conscious of the advantages offered by photothermal agents, compositing them with soft matrix, which finally produces many interesting works."

      "heading" : "8.2.1 Design Strategy",
      "text" : "Generally, photomechanical soft nanocomposites based on photothermal effects utilize the thermal energy generated by the photothermal agents, heating the soft matrix and causing changes in the volume of the material system. To actuate the whole system by light, there must be a connecting bridge between the microcos mic change and macrocosmic deformation. It is well known that the elevating temperature can bring about the phase transition of crystals or liquid crystals (LCs) [75], the movement of polymer chain segments [76, 77], and the changes in volume of macromolecules or hydrogels [78]. A rational design strategy is essen tial to magnify these changes into mechanical deformation.\nFigure  8.1 summarizes the design strategies employed for fabricating soft nanocomposite photoactuators based on the photothermal effect. Two main stream design methods are demonstrated as homodispersed single‐layer film and asymmetric bilayer or multilayer film. The former has been mainly devel oped from liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs), and the latter has been under development recently. The Noble Prize winner de Gennes first theoretically pre dicted that, similar to muscles, the nematic LCPs would deform in response to environmental stimuli through calculation [1, 2]. Then, the German scientist, Finkelmann, successfully fabricated monodomain‐aligned LCEs and observed a large deformation when inducing the LC to isotropic phase transition for the first time in the laboratory. Later, the groups of Ikeda and Keller further indepen dently developed this.\nPhotoactuating LCEs usually rely on the photoisomerization of azobenzene moieties upon irradiation of actinic light [79, 80]. It is well known that an LCE simultaneously possesses the order of an LC and the elasticity of an elastomer [4], enabling it to exhibit reversible deformation enabling diverse applications as functional materials. When the ordering of LCs is disrupted, the LCE will deform along the longitudinal axis of the LC molecules due to the molecular cooperative motion, which is one of the most fascinating properties of LCs. Excluding the exertion of polarizing light, we can find that the two key points of LCEs, which\nare very important for their actuating behaviors, are namely the orientation of the LCs and cross‐linking. Both guarantee the coherent and coordinating defor mation of LCE‐based materials. Then, the question as to how to get the deforma tion of LCEs can be simplified by focusing on how to disrupt the orientation of LCs. In addition to the photochemical reactions of azobenzene and cinnamate derivatives, the elevating temperature can also cause the disorder of LCs by inducing phase transition. By introducing the photothermal agents into the LCEs, the obtained nanocomposites can be easily photo‐manipulated.\nHowever, we should notice that the LC property is not a prerequisite to design ing the photomechanical soft nanocomposites. The nanocomposites relying on sol–gel transition [35] or shape‐memory effect (SME) [38] can also perform pho tomechanical motion with the aid of photothermal agents, as shown in Figure 8.1. Firstly, the monomers or the precursors of the soft matrix, such as cross‐linked LCPs (CLCPs), shape‐memory polymers (SMPs), and gels, are mixed homogene ously with the photothermal agents, which are then used to fabricate freestand ing films through different routes. When the composite film contains LCs, two common ways are often applied to orient the mesogenic molecules, namely mechanical stretching or pre‐alignment by the LC cell, as shown in Figure 8.1a,b.\n2898.2 Photomechanical Nanocomposites Based on Photothermal Effect\nThe homogeneously dispersed single‐layer film can contract, expand, bend, and twist or perform other mechanical activities due to the deformation gradient along the film thickness caused by the nonuniform light illumination and molar extinction coefficient of chromophore additives [81].\nThe second strategy for fabricating soft nanocomposite photoactuators is asymmetric fabrication, as shown in Figure 8.1c. In this way, the nanocomposite materials usually have two layers with a large numerically differential coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). The general structure of asymmetric fabrication is bilayer or bilamellar. It is worth noting that either layer can be either polymer or gel containing homogeneously dispersed functional additives (Figure 8.1a,b) or just a slice of a single component film. The nanocomposite actuating complies with the well‐known principle of bimetallic mechanism [82], and the photother mal agent acts as the part of a nanoheater.\nTable  8.2 shows the Young’s modulus, CTE, and coefficient of hygroscopic expansion (CHE) of some often applied materials in flexible electronics. It is con venient to design a photomechanical device by choosing two materials with a largely different CTE, such as poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and graphene to fabricate a nanocomposite film [50]. As given in Table 8.1, the CTE of GO and CNT is negative, which offers a large amount of photo‐energy converted heat and shrinks them, endowing the bilayer films with a larger light‐manipulated deformation. Therefore, carbon photothermal agents are widely used in design ing the bilayer structure."

GO is usually prepared by the modified Hummers method [85, 86], which can be ultrasonically homo‐dispersed in deionized water or organic solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). With easy modi fication, GO often possesses relatively better dispersibility in solvents than do CNTs or gold nanoparticles. In the fabrication process, GO was firstly dispersed in the solution of a soft matrix, such as a polymer‐dispersed LC  system like 5CB/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), or an SMP system like poly(vinylidenefluoride‐ hexafluoro propylene) (PVDF‐HFP). Then the homogeneous mixture of GO and polymer in solution was coated on a substrate (e.g. glass slide), forming a film by volatilization (Figure 8.2a,c). To acquire the photoactuating feature, the GO‐5CB/ PVA film should undergo mechanical stretching to orient the LC molecules. It is  well known that 5CB is a typically nematic LC with an LC‐to‐isotropic phase transition temperature slightly higher than room temperature. As a result, the heat originated from the photothermal effect of GO can induce the phase transition of 5CB, enabling the film to deform quickly (Figure 8.2b). As for the GO/PVDF‐HFP system, the heat energy stimulates the reversible crystal‐to‐ crystal phase transition of PVDF‐HFP and facilitates the nanocomposites with a specific shape in a particular range of temperature.\nOrganic Near‐Infrared (NIR) Dye/LCEs In 2016, Yang’s group reported the design and synthesis of one kind of LC‐like NIR absorbing dyes YHD796 [37]. This organic photothermal agent was inspired by Smith’s croconaine dye [87], as compared with the ICG dye. In addition, they noticed the potential of the thiophene‐croconaine dye to become the rigid mesogenic core for building calamitic LC molecular structures. By utilizing the like‐dissolve‐like theory, they mixed the synthesized NIR dye with LCEs via the LC cell fabrication method as shown in Figure 8.1b to ensure the stability and efficiency of the photothermal agent. The LC mixture and the NIR dye were simultaneously injected into the LC cell, which were then cured under illumination of one UV light. The freestanding film was obtained by dissolving the glass substrates with hydrofluoric acid (HF).\nAuNPs/Semicrystalline Polymers (SCPs) and AuNRs/LCEs Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) or gold nanorods (AuNRs) have a very high molar extinction coefficient and photothermal conversional efficiency thanks to their inherent SPR feature [41, 42]. However, they are generally immiscible with an organic matrix and easily aggregate, losing their SPR properties. In the nanocomposite actuating system, the well‐dispersed gold nanostructures should be grafted on the polymers with the assistance of a thiol ligand. Zhao’s group successfully fabricated optically controllable LCPs‐based actuators by surface functionalization of AuNPs with thiol‐substituted poly(ethylene‐co‐vinyl acetate) (EVA) [41]. Zhang’s group [42] stabilized the AuNRs through a three‐step sequential thiol‐click approach and embedded the AuNRs into the LCEs. More interestingly, the nanocomposites\nconsisting of gold nanostructures were found to deform and perform self‐ propelling motions [35]."

This problem has been elegantly overcome in the bilayer structure with only single component in either layer. However, the\ninterfacial interaction between the inorganic and organic layers should be seri ously considered. As shown in Figure  8.3a,c, Javey’s group [88] and Zhang’s group [20] independently reported the fabrication of a bilayer film by adopting an easy and economical way of vacuum filtration. To obtain single‐walled car bon nanotubes (SWCNTs)/PC film, the commercially available SWCNT pow der was first ultrasonically treated to remove impurities and the residual metal catalyst particles, which was then deposited on a polycarbonate (PC) membrane by vacuum filtration to form a bilayer film. In the fabrication of a GO/BOPP bilayer film, the GO sheet was firstly obtained by vacuum filtration, which was then attached to the biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film pre‐coated with pressure‐sensitive adhesive of acrylic ester.\nSWCNT/PVDF As shown in Figure 8.3b, Yang’s group reported another method for fabricating bilayer films by directly spin coating on a suitable and separable substrate [84]. When fabricating the SWCNT/PVDF bilayer film, they firstly spin coated one homogeneous PVDF solution on a glass slide and then dried the PVDF layer, which was then treated with plasma to make it hydrophilic. The SWCNT layer was deposited on the PVDF layer by the second spin coating. The bilayer film could be easily peeled from the glass substrate due to the high surface energy of the plasma‐treated PVDF.\n2938.2 Photomechanical Nanocomposites Based on Photothermal Effect\nMulticomponents in one of the Layers Graphene‐chitosan/PE and RGO‐CNT/PDMS Xie’s group successfully fabricated the graphene‐chitosan/PE bilayer film by choosing chitosan and polyethylene (PE) as the matrix for the sake of material transparency [50, 89]. The GO was synthesized from purchased graphite oxide according to the modified Hummers method, and then the reduced GO (RGO) was obtained through a typical refluxing method [90]. The PE film was chemi cally treated to become hydrophilic, enabling the homogeneous mixture of chi tosan and graphene to be easily coated on the film surface. After drying, the nanocomposite film was peeled from the glass substrate, as shown in Figure 8.4a. Similarly, Chen’s group utilized PDMS as the polymer matrix due to its large CTE discrepancy from the RGO‐CNT film, as given in Table 8.2 [50]. The RGO‐ CNT film was prepared by casting their mixed suspension on substrate followed\n294 8 Photomechanical Soft Nanocomposites\nby evaporating the solvent. Then the viscous PDMS mixture was coated on the RGO‐CNT film and cured at a high temperature (Figure 8.4c).\nSWCNT‐LCE/Silicone and CNT‐Paraffin Wax/PI Since CNTs easily agglomerate when mixing with most organic liquids, it is a big challenge to get well‐dispersed and uniform CNTs in matrix [15, 91]. Researchers have developed several methods such as shear‐mixing and ultrasonication to avoid the aggregation [92, 93]. One of the elegant ways is to introduce a dispers ing agent, which can interact with both the CNT and polymer matrix, making the CNT to homo‐disperse in matrix [40]. For instance, poly(p‐phenyleneethy nylene) (PPE)‐SWCNTs were synthesized and mixed with LCE monomers, and then the mixture was poured into molds and made to undergo photo‐polymeri zation [91]. The SWCNT‐LCE nanocomposites were further composited with silicone rubber slice to fabricate SWCNT‐LCE/silicone bilayer film (Figure 8.4b). Another example is CNT‐Paraffin wax/PI reported by Peng’s group. They firstly deposited the paraffin wax on the famous Kapton (polyimide) film by heating and spin coating [15]. Then the CNT sheet synthesized by chemical vapor depo sition was stacked on the bilayer film. Finally, the nanocomposite was reheated to make the CNT merge in the wax to obtain CNT‐Paraffin wax/PI bilayer film, as shown in Figure 8.4d."

When the composites have birefringent crystal or LC phases, polarizing optical microscope (POM) comes in handy [29]. To test the mesogenic or photothermal agents’ orientation degree of LCEs and polymer‐dispersed LCs or other ordered systems, the small‐angle X‐ ray scattering (SAXS), two‐dimensional (2D) SAXS [15, 39] and polarized ultra violet–visible absorption spectroscopy (UV–Vis) or polarized Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques are often useful. The dynamic mechan ical analysis (DMA) or dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) has been widely applied for characterization of the mechanical properties of the nano composite films, especially for the SMP‐based polymer composite films [21]. Owing to the existence of photothermal agents, it is very important to know the in‐situ photothermal conversion efficiency in the composites with the assistance of an infrared thermal imager or a thermometer [15, 88]. Finally, the photore sponsive properties, or in other words, the photomechanical performances of the nanocomposites can be studied under different light‐irradiation conditions.

      "text" : "Photothermal nanocomposite materials mainly respond to NIR and visible light, while the reports on the UV‐responsive photothermal actuators [38, 39] are fewer, since the photothermal agents usually have intensive absorption in the NIR region. In practice, visible light or NIR light has an advantage over UV light for its safety and innocuity to humans [37, 40]. Besides, NIR light possesses bio logical tissue penetration ability and, therefore, exhibits excellent biocompatibil ity and broad utility in biomedical applications [37]. However, visible light is easily available and cheap.\nGenerally, the photomechanical nanocomposites based on photothermal effect often respond to visible and NIR light, while those responsive to UV light are often based on photochemical effect. This is decided by the functional addi tives’ response to the wavelength of light. Obviously, if the photothermal agents and photochemical agents are simultaneously integrated into the same matrix, the nanocomposites may realize the NIR–Vis–UV full‐range light responsive ness. Multi‐wavelength‐responsive nanocomposite actuators can be fabricated by a similar method [30, 34, 59]. Thus, we can acquire different shape changes under photoirradiation of different light wavelengths [34, 59]. Since some photo thermal agents are sensitive to the wavelength of light, there are some reports about wavelength‐selective actuators [88, 91]. One such report mentions that the researchers can modulate the responsive wavelength band of the actuators by choosing CNTs with different chirality distributions [88].\nSome photomechanical nanocomposites not only respond to multi‐ wavelength light, but also to other stimuli, such as temperature [15] and moisture [20, 84]. The deformation of photothermal nanocomposites fabricated by asymmetric bilayer structures relies on the thermal expansion discrepancy between the two layers. As a result, the nanocomposites themselves can directly deform according to environmental temperature changes [15]. In addition to the CTE differential between the two layers, researchers find that the CHE differential of materials also can be used to prepare selective actuating (Table  8.2). For instance, the bilayer actuators made up of GO/BOPP [20] or SWCNT/PVDF [84] can deform by light illumination or by changing environmental moisture content.\nThe mechanical performance of the photomechanical nanocomposites is also an important parameter to evaluate from the viewpoint of applications. The introduction of carbon nanomaterials such as CNTs or metal nanoparticles into the soft matrix may reinforce the Young’s modulus of the nanocomposites to some extent [94]. However, the ductility and durability of the nanocomposites may be influenced by the microphase separation between organic and inorganic matters. This is another challenge in the fabrication of photomechanical nano composite materials.\nThe photoinduced deformation velocity and degree are the basic indexes to evaluate photomechanical nanocomposite materials. The responsive and recov ery velocity of photothermal actuators are often decided by several factors, such as the photothermal conversion efficiency of the photothermal agents, the ther mal conductivity of each component [40], the CTE discrepancy between the two layers, the modulus of the matrix, and other related elements. Owing to the time cost of the photothermal conversion, the responsive time of the photothermal\n296 8 Photomechanical Soft Nanocomposites\nactuators may range from several milliseconds [35] to few tens of seconds [21]. The deformation extent is generally decided by the photoinduced driving force, the modulus of the matrix, and so on. Usually, photothermal actuators with the maximum bending of 90° can easily realize the functions such as switches [41] and robotic arms [15]. The bending direction of the azobenzene‐LCEs is usually phototropic while the bilayer system can easily realize the phototropic and pho tophobic bending in one film, which originates from its asymmetric structure. To improve the properties of photothermal actuators, researchers may change and modify the photothermal agents or choose a suitable soft matrix. To make the actuators carry out specific work, researchers can design and combine the nano composites in a specific way [50, 91]."

When metal ions like Zn2+, Cd2+, and Co3+ are integrated into the polymeric system, the metal–ligand coor dination can aid cross‐linking that reinforces the materials and fixes the shape. Through breaking of these bonds, the nanocomposite materials can acquire the shape‐memory capability due to the release of residual stresses.\n2978.3 Photomechanical Nanocomposites Based on Photochemical Effect\nRowan and coworker studied end‐capped polybutadiene with pyridine groups to form metallo‐supramolecular polymers when mixed with the metal salts in solution [39]. Then the cast films were photo‐crosslinked through a thiol‐ene reaction with tetra‐functional thiol to form a permanent shape. Upon irradiation of UV light, the metal–ligand complexes absorbed the light energy and converted it into heat. The localized heating disassembled the coordinated complexes and softened the polybutadiene chain, making the polymers deformable. When removing the UV light, the interaction between the metal ions and the pyridine groups rearranged to fix the temporary shape. Subsequent exposure to continu ous UV light released the films to the original shape. Thus, the shape‐memory performance was obtained in this way.\nNote that the above‐mentioned disintegration still relied on photothermal effect, and the photoacid generator (PAG) provided a pure photochemical approach to trigger the shape‐memory effect. Yang and coworkers synthesized a  slightly cross‐linked poly(‐acrylamide‐co‐N‐vinylimidazole) hydrogel [104]. They forced the hydrogels into predesigned shapes and then immersed the hydrogels into solution containing metal ions and diphenyliodonium nitrate (that served as the PAG) without removal of the load. As a result, the imidazole groups interacted with the metal ions and held the temporary shape. The PAG generated protons under UV light irradiation lowering the pH value and further leading to the disassembly of the metal–ligand complexes, which ultimately brought the films back to the original permanent shape (Figure 8.5a).\nIt is worth pointing out that the PAG strategy can also be applied to polyelec trolyte hydrogels. Aoyagi and coworkers integrated nitrobenzaldehyde as the PAG into bilayer hydrogels composed of a polyacid layer and a polybase layer [105]. Under irradiation of UV light, the PAG accomplished a fast proton release, reducing the pH value, which enables the polyacid layer to contract and makes the polybase layer expand together, leading to a bending deformation, as shown in Figure 8.5b. More appealingly, with short and localized UV irradiation, the gels returned to their original shape after the removal of the light source due to the diffusion of protons and the increase of pH within the whole gels."

Many kinds of stimuli‐ responsive inclusive guests have been developed including photoactive azobenzene groups. Generally, trans‐azobenzene has superior complementa rity with CD molecules whereas cis‐azobenzene has a low association with CD molecules because of the bending configuration [107]. Thus, remote light irra diation can switch on or off the interaction between CD and azobenzene derivatives.\nRecently, Wu and coworkers reported supramolecular hydrogels based on tetra‐ortho‐methoxy‐substituted azobenzene and β‐CD (7‐membered sugar ring molecule) [108], showing red‐light responsive properties. The two com ponents were mixed in dark conditions to fabricate the supramolecular gel. When the obtained gel was exposed to red light (625 nm, 60 mW cm−2) after\n30 minutes, gel‐to‐sol transition occurred because of the triggered disassembly between cis‐azobenzene and β‐CD, as shown in Figure 8.6. The blue‐light irra diation or heating can trigger the cis‐to‐trans isomerization of azobenzene, leading to the reverse sol‐to‐gel transition.\nFurthermore, much effort has been made to induce macroscopic deformation in hydrogels beyond the mere gel‐to‐sol transition. Takashima et al. reported an excellent approach by slight covalent cross‐linking of polymer chains containing azobenzene and α‐CD (6‐membered sugar ring molecule) groups [109]. It was found that the formation of host–guest inclusion complexes altered the total cross‐linking density, thus endowing the hydrogel with expansion–contraction ability (Figure  8.7a). The α‐CD‐azobenzene gel immersed in water expanded approximately 24% in weight under 365 nm UV irradiation and shrank almost to  the original state upon exposure to 430 nm visible light. Furthermore, they achieved the away‐from‐light bending motion in hydrogel strips with several millimeters thickness (Figure 8.7b), because of the poor penetrability of UV light in polymers containing azobenzene.\nLi and coworkers designed triple shape‐memory hydrogels by integrating the above‐mentioned light‐responsive azobenzene‐CD inclusion complexes with pH‐responsive dansyl‐aggregations [110]. The initial flat film was deformed into an arc‐shape under UV light exposure and then the temporary shape was fixed by visible light irradiation. Once UV light irradiated the deformed film again, the azobenzene–CD inclusion complexes separated and the film returned to the permanent flat shape in 60 minutes.

Finkelmann and coworker provided a two‐step cross‐linking technique in which polymers were stretched under a slightly cross‐linked state and then the alignment was fixed by the sec ond cross‐linking reaction [117]. Besides, another method was employed by using pre‐assembled LC cells to align the mesogenic monomer capillary filled inside and usually a subsequent photo‐polymerization to fix the alignment by chemical cross‐linking [48, 118].

It was confirmed that the azobenzene mesogens were aligned along the orien tation of the CNT sheets through POM and polarized UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy.

The bent films reversibly returned to their flat state by exposure to 530 nm visible light.

Surprisingly, this CLCP/CNT composite strip exhibited photodeformable reversibility when UV irradiation was applied alternately on both sides of the strip.

This method elegantly provides another advantage that simply stretching the composite mem brane can orient the particles inside the composite films. Yu et al. first reported such a kind of photoresponsive polymer‐dispersed liquid crystalline polymer (PDLCP) films [26], as shown in Figure 8.8. They prepared wrinkled microparti cles with an azobenzene‐containing side chain LCP, which were homogeneously dispersed in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) aqueous solution. After casting the mixture on clean glass substrates and drying for one day, the PVA‐based PDLCP compos ite films were mechanically stretched to orient the azobenzene mesogens. During the evaporation of water, the LCP microparticles gradually concentrated on the upper layer of the films due to the low density of the polymer compared to that of water. Thus, upon irradiation of UV light, the upper layer underwent more contraction resulting in the bending motion toward the light source, as shown in Figure 8.8.\nThen the same group developed a similar method by introducing both a pho toresponsive azobenzene compound (5CAZ) and a low clearing‐point LC (5CB, TNI = 35 °C) together with GO as the nanoscale heating source into the PVA sub strate [30], as shown in Figure 8.9. In addition to the UV light, GO can absorb visible and NIR light and converts  these into thermal energy, inducing the nematic–isotropic phase transition of 5CB. The thermally induced changes in vol ume had the same effect as that of the trans‐to‐cis isomerization of 5CAZ. In addi tion, the responsive speed of photoactuating was much faster than that in the PVA‐based PDLCP system (Figure 8.8) since the phase transition occurred in low‐ viscous small molecules. To obtain reversible actuating properties, Zhou et  al.\nreplaced the PVA with SMP polyurethane. After UV‐light irradiation, the bent PDLC films recovered to the initial flat shape when being heated to 85 °C coincid ing with the shape‐memory temperature of the pure polyurethane [34, 120].\nInterestingly, the stretched nanostructure in polymer films could also orient the mesogens filled inside. Ryabchun et al. utilized stretched porous PE mem branes, which anchored the orientation of LCs along the direction of stretching\n3038.3 Photomechanical Nanocomposites Based on Photochemical Effect\n[28]. They infiltrated polymerizable LC monomers containing an azobenzene mesogen into the porous PE films and obtained a highly cross‐linked polymer network after polymerization. Such a bent film induced by asymmetric UV irra diation can be entirely recovered in about two minutes after removal of the light source. The reversibility is dependent on the cross‐linked structure and the mechanical property of the PE films.\nBesides soft materials, photoinduced deformation was also observed in molec ular crystals [121–124]. However, in these systems, actuators were always fragile and it was difficult to control size. Chen and coworker took advantage of the polymer‐dispersed strategy to solve these problems [125]. They added molecular crystals of 2‐hydroxynaphthylidene‐1′‐naphthylamine (HNAN) into a PVDF– HFP co‐polymer. Upon exposure to UV light, the rod‐like nanocrystals showed contraction along the long axis and expansion along the short axis, which reversed when the irradiation of UV light was stopped. They mixed the HNAN and PVDF–HFP in DMF to get a homogeneously dispersed solution and then cast the mixture onto a glass slide. Upon heating to remove DMF, the nanocrys tals concentrated in the lower layer and the long axis tended to align along the membrane surface for decreasing the surface free energy during the fabrication process. Finally, the composite film was obtained after removal of the solvent. Interestingly, these microscopic structures determined the bending toward the lower surface regardless of which side was illuminated."

As shown in Figure 8.11, a biomi metic actuator that simulated the blooming and fading of flowers was realized by taking advantage of triple shape‐memory hybrid films with azobenzene and GO dispersed in polyurethane matrix [34]. Upon irradiation of UV light, the pre‐ stretched nanocomposite films bent toward the light source, which mimicked the blooming of flowers. When exposed to successive NIR irradiation, the GO served as a nanoscale heating source and triggered the shape‐memory behavior of SMP polyurethane. As a result, the films reverted to the original short and flat state as if the flowers faded.\nThe most basic application of photomechanical soft nanocomposite materials is  in actuator fabrication, but the challenge mainly lies in how to achieve\n306 8 Photomechanical Soft Nanocomposites\nmore complicated motion than the bending deformation. Anisotropic orienta tion was utilized to realize complicated motion in LC systems and recent researches even achieved 2D and 3D deformation through introduction of topo logical defects [132, 133]. However, it is rarely reported in other soft matters. Recently, an anisotropic photothermal actuator was fabricated, which was inspired by hygroscopic seed dispersal in plants [15]. Aligned CNTs were embed ded in paraffin wax on a polyimide substrate, and when cut into strips with the long axis parallel or perpendicular to the CNT orientation, the obtained strips showed opposite bending direction under irradiation of visible light. Peng and coworkers also designed a telescopic arm consisting of a pre‐shaped helical strip that served as elevator, which underwent untwisting upon light irradiation, and six curving strips that served as claw, as shown in Figure 8.12A.\n3078.4 Applications\nIn addition, actuators with novel designed structures have been developed into more functionalized devices. For example, an IR‐light‐ driven actuator was reported based on bilayer composite materials composed of CNT‐doped LCE layer and silicone layer [91]. The actuator can climb a slope in the loop of bend ing and reverting with the help of two PC films in different shapes (Figure 8.12B). Similarly, Jiang et  al. prepared a PDMS platform with graphene nanoplatelets composited in one side [134]. They fabricated a fish‐like swimmer that can move forward, backward, and sideward on water (Figure 8.12C).\nAs the global energy crisis is becoming increasingly serious, photovoltaic materials have been intensively studied as novel energy sources producing electricity energy from light energy. More efforts have also been taken for the same purpose in photomechanical soft nanocomposite materials. As shown in Figure 8.13, an optical pendulum generator was designed with copper coils in the front of a bilayer LCP/LDPE photoactive film [53], as shown in Figure 8.13. Being placed in a magnetic field, the device generated a voltage pulse when the light was turned on and a damped oscillate voltage when the light was turned off according to Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. Interestingly, continu ous electrical output was also achieved by self‐shielding the light exposure real izing alternating photoinduced motions of bending and unbending. The fabricated optical pendulum generator showed advantages of simplicity, low cost and stability for coupling the photomechanical energy.\n308 8 Photomechanical Soft Nanocomposites\nPeng and coworkers proposed a new strategy by integrating photomechanical actuation and electrostatic effect. They prepared a 1D yarn containing two elec trodes. One electrode was aligned CNTs coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and the other was the afore‐mentioned CNT/paraffin wax/PI bilayer photoactuator [135]. The yarn was then treated by plasma to produce negative charge on the PTFE surface and then positive charge accumulated on CNT parts in both electrodes due to electrostatic attraction. When light was turned on, the photoinduced bending of yarn changed the distance between the PTFE surface and two CNT electrodes resulting in an electron flow. When the light was turned off, the recovery of distance led to an opposite voltage.\nRecently, photoresponsive lamina and flexible GO/PVDF‐HFP nanocomposite films were prepared by one simple solution‐casting method. Fast, stable, and reversible photomechanical behavior of the nanocomposite films upon irradia tion with visible light was observed based on the photothermal effect of GO and the shape‐memory effect of the polymer matrix. According to the principle of equilibrium apparatus, light‐powered tumbler movement was achieved in these films by imitating the structure of one wobbly man [27], as shown in Figure 8.14. Once the tumbler movement started, the oscillation continued for several hours as long as the visible light was irradiated. It is expected that more complicated movement can be achieved in these photomechanical nanocomposite films for full‐plastic devices of advanced functions driven by visible light.\nThere are still many excellent works that are not mentioned in this chapter [136, 137], but to be honest, all these applications would be far away from being practical. They have shortcomings in mechanical properties, stability, repeatabil ity, manufacturing, cost, and others. However, these shortcomings cannot over shadow the prospect of photomechanical actuators and that is the reason why this aspect attracts so many outstanding researchers.\n309 References"

      "text" : "In this chapter, we systematically introduced the fabrication, properties, and applications of photomechanical soft nanocomposite materials from different perspectives. The nanocomposites are on the basis of traditionally studied poly mer matrices, such as LCPs, CLCPs, SMPs, hydrogels, supramolecular polymers, and other commercially available polymer films. By doping or asymmetric assembling the functional additives with soft matrices, the fabricated nanocom posites show amazing photomechanical properties. Besides, the nanocompos ites usually possess more designability and easier fabrication features than the pure polymer matrices. The nanocomposites perform photodriven motions due to the photothermal or photochemical effect of the functional additives and the synergies between the additives and matrices, indicating their large potential in the photoactuating field.\nHowever, the existing defects in the nanocomposites still could not be ignored. The interface between the composite components, organic and inorganic mate rials, makes the phases or layer separation of nanocomposites to probably occur, which may intensely influence the service life and application range of the nano composites. The requirements of durability, stability, and adaptability to various working conditions are still challengeable for novel composite photoactuators. Other challenges not only for photomechanical nanocomposites but also for other systems are how to enhance their driving force and mechanical strength, and how to utilize their various deformations in real life."

      "text" : "Nature is unmatched in its esthetics and precisely controlled complexity of bio chemical structures of life and the way they function. Nature’s sophisticated functional hierarchical structures are mostly made from biopolymers like poly peptides and polysaccharides, which, over time, have evolved to respond to vari ous adverse external stimuli at levels ranging from molecular to macroscopic. The responses include change of color, shape, porosity, and stiffness [1, 2]. To cite a few, Cuttlefishes have mastered the art of color change for purposes of camouflage or as a way of warning against potential predators [3]. Mimosa pudica is a tropical plant that undergoes change in leaf orientation by closing and opening its foliage with response to touch and light [4]. The Venus flytrap, an insectivorous plant, can close its leaves to catch insects that touch its trigger hairs [5]. A vital organ in the human body, the heart, undergoes constant beats at the rate of 60–100 bpm, triggered by electrical impulses (Figure 9.1) [8]. Most of the man‐made polymers on the other hand are robust, but lack the stimuli‐ responsive functional properties seen in their natural counterparts. Many of these synthetic polymers are extensively used in our day‐to‐day life, but modern nanotechnology and biomedical applications, for example, require functionally active smart polymers.\nThe most commonly used synthetic commodity polymers are polyolefins. But, just as most known synthetic polymers, functional properties of polyolefins are static. The challenge is to develop a commercially viable stimuli‐responsive poly mer material, based on commodity polymers such as polyolefins. If we can make it respond to external stimuli, like light, such photoresponsive materials will have a wide range of applications [9, 10] in optical storage, sensors, actuators, artificial muscle, and soft‐robotics, etc. This chapter will discuss briefly the pho toresponsive polymeric systems in general and the need for photoresponsive commodity polymers, followed by recent developments of photoresponsive\nPhotoresponsive Polyolefins Shaji Varghese, John R.

      "text" : "Photo‐activation with a specific wavelength is one of the most commonly adopted external triggers for changing the properties of stimuli‐responsive materials and also for the development of photoactuators and other micro‐ devices as it is very convenient to apply remotely, cheap, and easy to control intensity and wavelength. Such photo‐activation of polymeric materials generally requires a photoresponsive chromophore incorporated in them. Azobenzene, spiropyran, and dithienylethene are examples of molecules that can reversibly change their  chemical structure upon light excitation and are also the most commonly used  light‐responsive chromophores in stimuli (photo)‐responsive polymers and materials. For example, azobenzene under goes light‐induced reversible isomerization with large geometrical changes between its thermally stable trans form with length of 0.9 nm and a metastable cis form with length of only 0.55 nm [11]. When this molecule is incorporated into a special polymeric network, it induces wavelength‐controlled macro scopic deformation. Such photoresponsive materials can convert light energy\n322 9 Photoresponsive Polyolefins\ninto mechanical energy and demonstrate reversible three‐dimensional shape changes, photomechanical actuators, etc. and a variety of such responsive sys tems have been reported during the past decade [12–14]. However, most of them are based on photoresponsive chromophore‐embedded hydrogels and liquid crystalline networks (LCNs) [15, 16]. LCNs combine the property of pol ymer networks and the properties of liquid crystals (LC) with prominent aniso tropic expansion. Azobenzene‐ related LCNs are very popular photoresponsive materials that undergo wavelength‐controlled reversible shape changes due to their cooperative molecular effect and have found wide range of applications in nonlinear optics, holography, actuators, soft‐robotics, etc. This wide explora tion of azobenzene based LCNs is due to the greater control of relative degree of order or phase associated with macroscopic deformation by light of appro priate wavelength [17]. The response process is caused by a small reversible change of the local molecular order. In case of a uniaxial molecular orientation, this leads to shrinkage in the direction along the molecular director while expansion will occur in all other directions. This disorder can be induced by molecular switches such as azobenzenes. Altering the chemical structure by the derivatization of the azobenzene core was studied in order to use different wavelengths of light ranging from UV to visible light; these modified structures also influence the photochemical properties of LCNs. One recent example of such an advanced LCN‐based photomechanical actuator was developed by Kumar et al. [18] to demonstrate the ability of utilizing sun light, the most abun dantly available source of energy, to create a self‐sustained oscillatory motion (Figure 9.2). This system used an engineered azobenzene moiety by ortho‐sub stitution, which absorbs the light from the visible region of the electromagnetic radiation. This ortho‐fluoro azobenzene polymer actuator has the potential for directly converting the solar energy into mechanical work, in addition to creat ing autonomous oscillatory function."

However, the photo‐ mechanical work output or light energy conversion efficiency is not high. One possible reason for this may be due to the low elastic modulus and low strength [21]. For the future, for commercial development of light‐controlled micro‐ devices and soft‐robotics greater photomechanical force output with minimal expense is required as the mechanical work output is an important performance tool for the polymer actuators or micro‐devices.

To improve the work efficiency, dielectric elastomers have been demonstrated with the potential of creating artificial muscles [25]. An alternative strategy that is both cost‐effective and direct, is to use responsive flexible semi‐crystalline commodity plastic materials [26].\nHigh photo‐mechanical work output can be obtained by photoresponsive semi‐crystalline polymeric materials such as polyolefins, because of their flexi bility and high Young’s modulus. Since mechanical energy is directly related to the Young’s modulus, using such polymeric systems is one way to improve work output significantly [25]. Additionally, these polymers are also available in large quantities at a cheaper price. However, it should be noted that the strains of these materials are low, which can be overcome by careful device design. Research in this direction requires renewed effort although the first reported photoresponsive material is based on such a category of polymer. In 1966, Merian observed that a semi‐crystalline polymer fiber, nylon dyed with an azobenzene derivative shrank upon photoirradiation [27]. Although the observed contraction was very small (0.1%), his research laid the foundation for azobenzene‐based photoresponsive materials. The photoinduced contraction in this case may have been a combined effect of trans–cis isomerization and photothermal effect or just the latter. This work was followed by Eisenbach\nin  1980 who demonstrated improved responsive nature when azobenzene‐ functionalized poly(ethyl acrylate) was used. The improvement, however, was not very remarkable as the photoinduced contraction reached only ~0.25% [28]. The plastic objects evolved from static to next generation complex responsive materials (Figure 9.4) during the last decade after the discovery of large photoin duced bending of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) in 2001 [17, 30]. The development in this direction includes the semi‐crystalline‐based polymers as well [31]."

      "heading" : "9.4 Polyolefins",
      "text" : "Polyolefins can range from ultra‐rigid thermosets to high‐performance elasto mers via all conceivable thermoplastic and elastoplastic materials in between. As a result they account for more than 55% of the global commodity plastic materi als demand (Figure 9.5). Yet, if one looks at their chemical composition, poly olefins are surprisingly limited: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), a few copolymers of ethylene with propene or another α‐olefin, and little else [33]. This success has come from a deep understanding of the synthesis and pro cessing of these polymers at a multiple‐length scale, from chain topology to crys talline morphology and orientation. The combination the know‐how of this structure property, cost of the materials, and base monomer means that a poly olefin solution often finds itself as the preferred option, from a price/perfor mance balance. Consequently, polyolefins are employed in a wide range of applications such as infrastructure (water and gas piping and energy transmis sion); advanced packaging, light and reliable packaging that reduce transport emissions while increasing the self‐life of perishable goods; and automotive application replacing metal with light material that allows for lighter automo biles and niche areas such as biomedical material and high‐strength ultra‐high molecular weight PE (UHMW‐PE) fibers. Highly oriented UHMW‐PE fibers are\nspecial types of linear polyolefins containing very long chain PE with an average molecular weight over 1000 kg mol−1 and crystallinity of more than 90%, which makes them impressive polymers with highly remarkable mechanical properties such as high Young’s modulus (>200 GPa), high abrasion resistance, high impact strength, and low coefficient of friction. Owing to these unique qualities of UHMW‐PE fibers, they are highly suitable for high‐ performance applications such as protective clothing and gloves, fishing lines, marine ropes, anti‐ballistics, prosthetic implants, surgical sutures, etc. [34]. Dyneema®, is one of the commer cial brand of highly aligned UHMW‐PE fiber from DSM and is already market ing such high‐performance products [35]. The intriguing question we can ask here, is, can we make these static material into functional systems that can mimic nature? In other words, is it possible to make a responsive polyolefin for advanced applications? To answer this question, we highlight some of the impres sive research done in that direction."

      "text" : "Ikeda’s light‐driven plastic motor device is one of the first examples that used PE bilayer layer films based designs. This plastic motor is based on a composite film consisting of a light‐responsive, azobenzene‐based LCN layer laminated on unstretched low‐density PE (LDPE) sheet [29]. The resultant bilayer sheet is connected to both ends to form a ring, which in turn is attached to a homemade pulley system as a belt in such a way that the azobenzenes are aligned in the ring direction (Figure 9.6) facing the light source. When the prepared system is irra diated by UV light (365 nm, 240 mW cm−2) from the top right and by visible light (>500 nm, 120 mW cm−2) from top left simultaneously, the plastic belt is rotated, which in turn drives the two pulleys in a counterclockwise direction at room temperature. This is the first plastic device that was reported to be able to con vert the light energy into mechanical work in the form of continuous rotation in one direction. They have explained the mechanism of the light‐controlled, uni directional movement as follows: a local contraction force was generated along the alignment direction of the azobenzene mesogen upon UV irradiation due to the trans to cis isomerization of azobenzene, which is parallel to the long axis of the ring. This contraction force acted on the right pulley to rotate in the coun terclockwise direction. At the same time, irradiation by visible light produced a local expansion force due to the cis to trans isomerization, which caused a counterclockwise rotation of the left pulley. These continuous contraction and\n3279.5 Photoresponsive Polyolefins\nexpansion forces generated at different parts along the long axis of the belt, resulting in the rotation of the pulleys with the ring was unidirectional. Although the PE layer did not contribute directly to the photoresponsiveness, it provided better mechanical strength and flexibility to the system.\nThe bilayer composition of a flexible PE (or PP) film and an LCN was also used to demonstrate light‐driven micro‐devices such as: (i) a simple device that moved like a “robotic arm”; (ii) a device that can walk in one direction like an “inch worm”; (iii) a soft micro‐robot that can pick, lift, move, and place objects; and (iv) a plastic wheel with tunable rolling (or moving) direction and speed. The detailed design and working principle of such photoresponsive devices are described further.\nIkeda and coworkers have also developed a “robotic arm” based on a lami nated  film, which consists of photoresponsive azobenzene LCN and a flexible unstretched PE layer [36]. As shown in Figure 9.7, the laminated film contains LCN layers at two places with the azobenzenes aligned along the long axis. This system shows sequential and flexible motion upon continuous irradiation of the\nUV and visible light. A bent laminated film is based on a similar bilayer design but the LCN layer at the central part shows lateral movement by alternate irra diation with UV and visible light, which mimics the walk of an inchworm [36]. The plastic inchworm had an asymmetric end‐shape design to make such photoresponsive directional movement (Figure 9.8). Upon alternate irradiation with UV and visible light at room temperature, the sharp and flat edges of the plastic inchworm acted as the stationary points, respectively. As a result, the inchworm walked unidirectionally.\nIn addition to the controlled thermal back isomerization, the main advantage of azobenzene‐based photoactive material is that the substitution pattern can result in difference in absorption and, therefore, a modified azobenzene can be used for visible light or even direct sunlight as the energy source. Yu and cowork ers designed and synthesized a new LCN/PE bilayer composite film that contains longer conjugated azotolane structure in the side chain (Figure  9.9b) as the photo‐reversible chromophore in the LCN layer, transfers visible light directly into mechanical energy [37]. Using this approach they have demonstrated a vis ible‐light‐driven soft micro‐robot, which was manipulated to pick, lift, move,\nand place milligram‐scale objects by light irradiation at different part as shown in Figure 9.9. Opening and closing motion of the hand part of this plastic robot was achieved simply by switching the light on and off instead of changing the wavelength of the light used. This is because the bilayer curvature can be reverted to its original flat shape by turning off the light.\nLu et al. fabricated a light‐driven wheel based on a laminated bilayer composite film composed of azobenzene‐containing LCE layer and a transparent PP layer of thickness around 45 μm [38]. Carefully laminated architectural design by con trolled setting of the LCEs film as the outer or inner layer of the bilayer wheels enabled the wheels to roll away from and toward the light source, respectively on a flat surface (Figure 9.10). They have explained the mechanism of the movement as the nonuniform bending of the LCE layers, which can create a curvature of the laminated film by incident UV light. This asymmetric deformation of the wheel is considered to be the driving force of the rotatory movement. The speed of the rotatory movement can also be controlled by adjusting the strain energy stored in the film. For example, film with more energy stored in it moves faster. To achieve this, the wheels were fabricated with LCEs films stretched to either 200% or 100% strain before lamination. They have also demonstrated that the speed of\nrotatory movement can be controlled by other parameters such as intensity of incident light or the radius of the wheel."

      "text" : "The above examples of bilayer composite design have already shown the use of polyolefins as a supportive layer for the photoresponsive micro‐device design due to its flexibility and modulus. However, the laminated composite actuators with an adhesive layer may suffer low life time due to the delamination of the two layers after long exposures to the light source [39]. Direct incorporation of a\n332 9 Photoresponsive Polyolefins\nphotoresponsive chromophore or materials in the polyolefin matrix is a very straightforward strategy to make a cost‐effective (mass‐production) responsive material. Commercial availability, low cost, flexibility, and high Young’s modulus of the polyolefins make it the best host polymer matrix for the large‐scale pro duction of light‐responsive actuators or soft‐robotics based on monolayers. Some of the attempts in this direction are mentioned further.\nRyabchun et al. have reported such an approach for the first time. They have used the stretched porous PE as the matrix for azobenzene‐based LCNs to create photo‐actuators. These plastic films were capable of reversibly deforming with response to light irradiation [40]. High deformation values of these new PE com posites film and its reversibility were demonstrated (Figure 9.11). These plastic photoactuators combined several advantages such as lack of the need for align ing coatings and complex cell preparation process, good mechanical properties, and relatively low‐cost fabrication. They have also studied the kinetic and ther modynamic features of the process of bending of the LCNs/PE monolayer com posite actuators."

      "heading" : "9.6 Photo Patterning",
      "text" : "Apart from photoactuators based on polyolefins, photopattering, or surface micro‐patterning of PE films have wide range of applications including in optical recording, optical memory devices, sensors, biofouling, and tissue engineering [41]. Several methods were developed for micro‐patterning of polymers like photolithography, holography, micro‐ and nanoprinting and inkjet printing, etc. Bobrovsky et al. [42, 43] reported a photopatternable polymer composite film based on stretched porous PE and LC. The resultant film was analyzed by SEM (Figure 9.12a) in order to confirm the porous aligned nature of the LC/PE com posite matrix as showed in Figure 9.12b. The chemical structures of LC mono mers and cross‐linkers are showed in Figure 9.12c. This film was then irradiated with UV light through a mask, Figure 9.12d–f shows a polarized optical micros copy image of such optical photo‐recording. This pattern is quite stable over time, due to the slow cis–trans back isomerization. This slow back isomerization is mainly due to the controlled substitution pattern of the azobenzene unit.\nUchida et al. extended such a photopattering approach into a useful three bits eight state recording system by incorporating three different photoresponsive diarylethene derivatives into a polyolefin matrix (poly(cyclopentene) polymer) [44]. When irradiated with UV light, the three different diarylethene derivatives changed to their closed‐ring structure with the formation of yellow, red, and blue colors. They were able to selectively bleach the color by applying the specific wavelength of UV light that matched the closed ring form of different deriva tives. Since the spectra of the closed forms of the diarylethene derivatives are in the IR region in addition to UV–Vis, IR light of a specific wavelength could be used to read the eight states. Figure 9.13 shows the schematic of the recording on photochromic polymer film.\nSurface micro‐patterning of uniaxially drawn high‐density PE (HDPE) films using interference holography with a nanosecond pulsed laser was demonstrated\nrecently by Shen et  al. [41]. They used UV absorber, 2‐(2H‐benzotriazole‐2‐ yl)‐4,6,‐diterpentylphenol (BZT) incorporated oriented HDPE film to generate a micro‐pattern. Upon illumination with an interference pattern, the BZT mole cule induces transition from light to heat creating a height relief grating. This topography was found to be dependent on the concentration of the BZT used and also on the light energy dose applied. The detailed schematic diagram of the experimental setup for the interference is shown in Figure 9.14A. The generated surface patterns were analyzed by AFM technique. Figure 9.14B (a and b) shows the AFM images and the height profile of the oriented HDPE films containing 5 wt% BZT after illumination with interference pattern (Λo = 9.5 μm) at an energy dose of 120 mJ cm−2 and at various angles (α) between the grating direction and the film drawing direction. Additionally, this aligned and chain‐extended PE films with the surface relief gratings are also evaluated as strain sensors in tensile deformation. By this approach, strains below 10% are monitored accurately in a transmission mode.\nPolyolefins‐based photoresponsive systems are not limited only to the above‐ mentioned applications. Despite the fact that these are the old polymers, incor porated functions offered us exciting new perspectives, which cope with the current society demands. The following section will discuss some of the chal lenges, recent developments, and future directions.\n336 9 Photoresponsive Polyolefins"

      "heading" : "9.7 Challenges for Photoresponsive Polyolefins and Future Directions",
      "text" : "One of the major challenges to be addressed during the development of polyole fin‐based photoresponsive materials is photo‐oxidative degradation. It should be noted that UV radiation is the greatest contributor for deep deterioration of ulti mate mechanical properties and degradation of polyolefins in the presence of oxygen [45]. This can be addressed by choosing an appropriate photoresponsive unit that can also act as the stabilizer, in addition to maintaining the photore sponsiveness [46, 47]. This approach will prevent the auto‐oxidation cycle of the photodegradation of responsive polyolefins and will increase the lifetime.\nAnother challenge is the incorporation of the photoresponsive chromophore to the polyolefin, due to its immiscibility with the polymer matrix as polyolefins are highly nonpolar. But this can be addressed by careful design and chemical modification of the photoresponsive molecular unit while maintaining the ther mal stability and photoisomerization. Compatibility with biological systems for the development of integrated bionics can also be considered. UHMW‐PE already showed utility in human hip/knee transplants in the static forms [48]. Recently, advanced medical textiles based on medical grade UHMW‐PE fibers have also been developed for various implantable devices. These developments shed the hope for the easy human–machine interface of responsive‐polyolefins. One of the immediate practical medical applications we can consider are pho toresponsive intravenous needles of such highly oriented polymer fibers, which can be activated by near‐infrared (NIR) light inside the body. If successful, they can be promising tools with minimal invasive medical application [49, 50].\nOther semi‐crystalline, amorphous commodity polymers (Figure 10.5) also can be used instead of contemporary light‐responsive polymers in order to design devices that can do greater mechanical work. For example, azobenzene‐ functionalized polyimides have shown large deformation and higher photo‐ generated force output by White and coworkers [51, 52]. These polymers are amorphous to semi‐crystalline and exhibit high glass transition temperature (Tg) and high storage moduli with good thermal stability. Photoinduced bending behavior with a bending angle ranging from 0° to 90° in 30 minutes has been demonstrated for one such polymer. This research already indicates that a care ful rational design and polymer modification of polyolefins with an azobenzene unit can be used to create photoresponsive polymeric materials. The above work additionally signals that the alignment of the photoresponsive chromophore in the polymer matrix is one of the key factors to be considered while developing the photoresponsive semi‐crystalline or commodity polymers. This can be achieved either by synthesizing the polymer with photoresponsive unit incorpo rated in the main chain [53] or creating a composite polymer material where the photoresponsive chromophore is aligned within the host polymer matrix as a guest.\nThe responsive nature of semi‐crystalline polymers need not only be limited to photoresponsiveness; we can also consider other external stimuli such as humid ity, pH, temperature, electricity, mechanical stress, etc. The amorphous and the crystalline region of some of the highly oriented (e.g. Nylon, PE) fibers contract\n337 References\nin length and expand in volume, respectively, in response to temperature [54, 55]. Based on this principle, temperature‐responsive artificial muscles were devel oped utilizing such commercial polymers by Baughman and coworkers with the specific work output of 2000 J kg−1 during contraction which is 20 times larger than that of natural muscle [55]. The same group earlier developed a guest‐filled, twist‐spun carbon nanotube yarn, which is not only temperature responsive, but also photothermal responsive [56]. Moreover, semi‐crystalline polymers based on shape‐memory response were studied for several interesting applications [57]. These include the strong polymer fiber, UHMW‐PE [58]. In addition to temperature‐responsive commodity polymers, humidity‐responsive polyamides have also been demonstrated with the possibility of developing next‐generation smart textiles [59]. Other responsive functions such as change of color can be obtained by incorporating chromophores such as spiropyran; the resultant system can be used for the development of sensors. Recently, responsive cho lesteric liquid crystals having structural color have been attached to nylon to fabricate color changing textile and optical strain sensors [60]. Such develop ments and outlooks are in the direction of future commercial development of smart materials with interesting yet useful functions.\nThe responsive materials based on semi‐crystalline (non‐liquid crystalline) or commodity polymers have begun to grow in demand due to their commercial availability, easy fabrication process, flexibility, and high Young’s modulus which are expected to generate greater work output in addition to mechanical stability."

Converting light energy to mechanical energy or motion utilizing photoresponsive polymeric materials have led to smart micro‐ devices that can do useful work. The work output most likely can be improved by utilizing high Young’s modulus, semi‐crystalline commodity polymers such as polyolefins with careful device design. Such photoresponsive systems are a promising yet inexpensive way of converting light into mechanical work. Additionally, this approach provides a tool to control the bulk polymer proper ties of polyolefins remotely. These developments foresee a future commercial development of responsive commodity polymers in fields such as soft‐robotics and micro‐devices with greater adaptability, sensors, motors and artificial muscles, etc."

Some natural examples are the multilayered structure of pearls, the flashing wings of several insects, and natural opals as shown in Figure 10.1.\nRecently, there has been growing interest in developing bioinspired nanostruc tures that suppress defects, and control the symmetry and size of PCs [4–10].

Thus, PCs can reflect the light coming onto the crys tal. The forbidden wavelength ranges are called a photonic band gap (PBG), which performs similar behavior as the electronic band gap created by the peri odic arrangement of atoms in a semiconductor [11, 12].

The PBG mainly depends on the angle of inci dence, the lattice constants, and material composition of PCs. When the light passes in a PC of spherical particles as shown in Figure 10.3, the diffraction of light can be described by the Bragg–Snell law [3, 7, 13–20],\nm d n= −2 2 2\neff sin (10.1)\nwhere, m is the order of diffraction, λ is the wavelength of light, d is the inter planar spacing, θ is the angle of incidence of light with respect to the normal, and neff is the effective refractive index which is related to the sum of the refractive indices of the two media, weighted by their volume fraction. Therefore, any vari ation in either spacing or refractive index results in a shift of the Bragg reflection peak.\nSome practical schemes for tunable PCs that are based on the concept of changing the lattice constants have been reported. For example, control of the spatial structure has also been realized by taking advantage of the volume phase transition of hydrogels, where PBGs have been tuned by controlling the tempera ture, the pH, and the ionic state, or by using photoisomerization of azobenzene derivatives [21–24]. Figure 10.4 shows an example of the tuning of a PBG based on the concept of changing lattice constants by trans–cis photoisomerization of azobenzene molecules attached in a hydrogel network around a self‐assembled crystalline colloidal array [22]. 3D periodic structure was constructed by self‐ assembly of colloidal particles due to long‐range electrostatic repulsions between particles, and following the formation of the hydrogel network.\n344 10 A Photoresponsive Multi‐Bilayered Film for a Tunable Photonic Crystal\nLarge shifts in PBGs have been demonstrated by controlling the lattice con stants.

In addi tion, application of external stimuli such as an electric field causes a dynamic change in the molecular orientation perpendicular or parallel to the direction of the external stimuli corresponding to the property of LMWLCs [32]. However, it is not easy to control the molecular orientation of polymer liquid crystals (PLCs) mainly because of their high viscosity. Therefore, the development of a facile technique to control the molecular orientation of PLCs uniformly, or the devel opment of PLCs showing spontaneous molecular orientation, will open the door for new functions or new materials. There are some reports on polymers show ing out‐of‐plane molecular orientation by annealing: side chain type PLCs, main\n346 10 A Photoresponsive Multi‐Bilayered Film for a Tunable Photonic Crystal\nchain type PLCs, and so on [33–39]. It is likely that the polymers possessing a smectic phase tend to show thermal out‐of‐plane molecular orientation by annealing at the smectic phase. Bobrovsky et al. have reported that a polyacrylate copolymer having both 4‐ethoxy‐4′‐hexyloxyazobenzene and cholesterol groups as a side chain group showed spontaneous out‐of‐plane molecular orientation on a glass substrate by annealing at 75 °C, whereas less out‐of‐plane molecular orientation was observed for a polymethacrylate homopolymer having the same azobenzene side group (PA6Az2 in Scheme 10.1) [40]. In contrast, we found that a polyacrylate homopolymer consisting of 4‐methoxy‐4′‐hexyloxyazobenzene (PA6Az1 in Scheme 10.1) aligned spontaneously in the out‐of‐plane orientation on a glass substrate by annealing at a smectic phase (80 °C) [31]. It is interesting to note that a very small difference in the terminal substituent has a large effect on the spontaneous molecular orientation behavior of the polymers. However, there are few systematic studies on the thermal out‐of‐plane molecular orienta tion of polyacrylates and polymethacrylates with azobenzene side groups.\nFigure  10.6 shows the annealing effect on the molecular orientation of a PA6Az1 film. The film was prepared by spin coating a PA6Az1/cyclohexanone solution onto a glass substrate, and annealed at 80 °C. Before annealing, there were two strong peaks at c. 250 and 350 nm corresponding to φ–φ* and π–π* transitions, respectively. Upon annealing, the absorbance at 350 nm was signifi cantly decreased, whereas no change in the absorbance at 250 nm was observed. It has been reported that the φ–φ* transition is insensitive to the orientation; consequently, the change in the relative intensity of the π–π* absorption band to the φ–φ* absorption band (Aπ–π*/Aφ–φ*) is related to the transformation from the in‐plane orientation to the out‐of‐plane orientation. The film was rotated hori zontally by 45°, and polarized absorption spectra of the PA6Az1 film at an inci dent angle of 45° to the normal of the film were measured by rotating the polarization plane of the monitor light (dotted line). As shown with the dotted line in Figure 10.6a, the π–π* absorption band at the rotation angle of 0° (moni tored with horizontally polarized light, curve A0) was shifted to a shorter wave length, whereas at 90° a weak π–π* band was observed (curve A90). In order to clarify the change in the molecular orientation by annealing, the absorbance at 250 and 320 nm was plotted as a function of the rotation angle in Figure 10.6b. A significant rotation angle dependence was observed for the absorbance at 320 nm.

In order to discuss the structural effect on the spontaneous out‐of‐plane orientation of the polymers by annealing, the order parameter, S, of the out‐of‐plane orientation was evaluated using the following Eq.

The order parameter was increased by elevating the annealing temperature up to a smectic phase, and then decreased at a higher temperature near the phase transition temperature from the smectic phase to the nematic phase. The highest order parameter of the out‐of‐plane orientation obtained in the temperature range studied for each polymer was measured as a function of methylene spacer length. In a series of PAmAz1, the polymers having methylene spacers in a range of 6–10 showed a higher order parameter [41]. In this range of spacer length, the order parameter of the polyacrylates (PAmAz1) is higher than that of the polymeth acrylates (PMmAz1). This may be related to the rigidity of the main chain or steric hindrance associated with methyl groups attached to the main chain of the polymethacrylates."

A He–Ne laser light (633 nm) was used as a monitor light. For the refractive indices of PA6Az1 for ordinary and extraordinary lights of 633 nm, ne and no, are estimated to be 1.71 and 1.48, respectively [42, 43].

Because, the refrac tive index of the PA6Az1 film must be controlled between 1.48 (no, out‐of‐plane state) and 1.64 (ne, in‐plane random state) by the annealing and following photoi somerization, and the refractive index of PVA is 1.49, which is nearly equal to the refractive index of the out‐of‐plane state of PA6Az1."

If a UV transparent biphenyl group possesses cooperative orientation ability synchro nized with motion of azobenzene group, the switching speed will be improved based on the improvement of the penetration property of UV light in the film due to the decrease in the azobenzene chromophore concentration (Figure 10.12) [46].

Therefore, the introduction of LC\ngroups with long conjugation such as tolan, schiff base, and stilbene in the azobenzene polymers is expected to be effective to improve the photoinduced reflection switching behaviors for the multi‐bilayered films composed of the azobenzene‐containing copolymers and PVA.\nLC groups with long‐conjugated systems were employed for the copolymers of Az100 (PA6Az1), AzStb, AzTo, AzToMe, and AzSchi as shown in Scheme 10.3.

Four hundred and thirty six nanometers visible‐light irradiation caused the decrease in the reflection inten sity for all films due to the transformation to the out‐of‐plane orientation. For copolymers of AzTo82 and AzToMe91, the response speed of reflection was faster than that of Az100. The result indicates that the out‐of‐plane orientation behavior in the multi‐bilayered films was improved by copolymerization with To and ToMe groups, possibly due to their lower Tg as compared to that of Az100. On the other hand, photo‐response speed of reflection of AzSchi73 was slower than that of Az100 even with a lower Tg. It is attributed to the surface energy depending on the hydrophobicity of LC groups that are sandwiched by hydro philic PVA layers.\nIn order to estimate the hydrophobicity of LC molecules, the dipole moments and partition coefficient (log P) were calculated using Spartan’14 (Wavefunction, Inc.) with the B3LYP/6‐31G* method. For Az, Schi, and To groups, they were respectively estimated to be 0, 1.24, and 0 D for dipole moments; and 4.22, 3.65, and 3.72 for log P. Consequently, Schi group exhibiting higher polarity is rela tively less hydrophobic. Therefore, AzSchi layers sandwiched by PVA layers are less preferable for the out‐of‐plane orientation compared with the other copol ymers, based on higher surface energy. This is supported by the experimental\n356 10 A Photoresponsive Multi‐Bilayered Film for a Tunable Photonic Crystal\nresults of thermally induced out‐of‐plane orientation behaviors. When AzTo73 and AzSchi73 were annealed at 70 °C, their S values for the out‐of‐plane orien tation were respectively estimated to be 0.73 and 0.34. As expected, S values of AzSchi73 were lower than that of AzTo73.\nOn the other hand, for 365‐nm UV light, the reflection for all films increased. The light response of AzToMe91 was faster than those of Az100 and other copol ymers, indicating improvement of random orientation behavior, which was attributed to light penetration deep inside. On the other hand, AzTo82 had apparently poor response to UV light. Namely, random orientation was not suf ficiently induced by accumulation of cis isomers of azobenzene groups. It is due to the strong intermolecular interaction between To groups as described in our previous reports [51]. It is also supported by the observation that the Tg of AzTo decreased lesser with increase of molar ratio of the mesogen group as compared to the Tg of AzToMe. In contrast, ToMe group is considered to be advantageous for random orientation because of steric hindrance of methyl group.\n357 References\nReversible on–off switching of reflection was achieved by the sequence of light irradiation of 436‐nm visible light (for the out‐of‐plane orientation state; reflection = OFF) and 365‐nm UV light following 546‐nm visible light (for the random orientation state; reflection = ON), as shown in Figure 10.16.

The 1D‐ PC was prepared by alternative spin coating of a hydrophobic polymer consisting of azobenzene groups and PVA as hydrophilic polymer, providing multi‐ bilayered films with precisely controlled layer thickness. The on–off switching was achieved by combining thermally spontaneous molecular orientation of azoben zene molecules and their photoisomerization between trans‐ and cis‐forms, resulting in the change in PBG of the 1D‐PC. To improve the light‐response effi ciency across the entire films, the molecular structure of azobenzene polymer was studied by introducing non‐photoresponsive LC mesogen groups because of their UV transmittance, molecular orientation behavior, and birefringence characteristics. A reflection intensity higher than 90% was observed for the 1D‐ PC stacked with 20‐bilyers, and contrast of reflection change was visually suffi cient. The entire thickness of the 1D‐PC is within a few microns, so they are light. Therefore, the photoresponsive 1D‐PC will be promising candidates for applica tions to optical materials that need to be light, thin and save energy such as mate rial replacing paper, self‐standing reflective color display devices, and so on."

      "text" : "Liquid crystals (LCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their pro nounced high optical anisotropy/transparency over a wide electromagnetic spectrum, high sensibility to various external field stimuli (such as electric/ magnetic field, light irradiation, and heat) and strong capability for matter and electromagnetic field interactions [1–4]. Thanks to their large birefringence and reconfigurable director (i.e. local optical axis) orientation, LCs have become one of the most attractive candidates for making optical devices requiring versatile functionalities. Particularly, liquid crystal display (LCD) holds a dominant posi tion in the flat panel display market nowadays. Essentially, they are composed of a huge number of separate light intensity modulators in the visible range [3, 5]. In addition to amplitude, LCs can freely manipulate other spatial degrees of light, such as polarization and phase. Through specifical designing of the director dis tribution of LC domains, one could arbitrarily manipulate the optical field [6, 7].\nOptical field control is a key requirement for optics and photonics. Structured light, also known as shaped light or tailored light, is a light beam that has cus tomized intensity, polarization, and phase. Recently, specific beams including vortex beams [8, 9], vector beams (VBs) [10], and Airy beams [11] have been studied intensively due to their fantastic properties and diverse applications in optical trapping, laser processing, high‐resolution imaging, etc. Generally, these beams can be directly generated from Gaussian beams by spatially manipulating the amplitude or phase of light. Such manipulations could be accomplished by lens [12, 13] or plates [14, 15] with specific curvature radius, photoresist masks [16–18], or metasurfaces [19–21] with delicately designed structures. However, their optical characteristics are static once the respective device is fabricated, which severely restricts corresponding applications. Thanks to the electro‐ optical tunability of LCs, structured LC domains make these devices dynamic and more efficient.\nPhotoinduced Liquid Crystal Domain Engineering for Optical Field Control Wei Hu, Peng Chen, and Yan‐Qing Lu\nNanjing University, Department of Quantum Electronics and Optical Engineering, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 22 Hankou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210093, China\n362 11 Photoinduced Liquid Crystal Domain Engineering for Optical Field Control\nTo date, several strategies have been developed for LC domain engineering. Typically, patterned electrodes [22–25] and polymer‐dispersed LCs [26] were adopted to locally and poloidally guide the LC directors to form binary domains. However, their manufacture is complicated and the devices suffer from fixed structures. Dynamic LC domain generation could be accomplished by a com mercial spatial light modulator (SLM) [27, 28]. As shown in Figure 11.1, an SLM consists of numerous discrete micro‐size LC pixels driven separately. Never theless, the complex electrode matrix makes the SLM costly, optically inefficient, and limits the quality of the generated beams. All the above LC microstructures are realized through the polar angle control of LCs. Actually, their azimuthal angle could also be employed to form LC multi‐domains. Micro‐ rubbing [29– 31] and patterned rubbing [32, 33] are adopted to carry out the patterned align ment and subsequently guide the local directors to form the desired pattern. Compared to these mechanical methods, photoalignment is much more suitable for implementing accurate and high‐resolution multi‐domain LC alignments\n36311.2 Photoalignment Technology and Photopatterning System\n[34, 35]. In the initial research, multistep photolithography [35, 36] and hologra phy [37–40] are commonly utilized. More recently, several techniques exhibiting superior image‐output flexibility are developed [41–44], facilitating the realiza tion of complex LC orientations and subsequent optical characteristics. These techniques fully unlock a new degree of freedom to manipulate LC domains.\nIn this chapter, we concentrate on the recent progresses made in optical field control via photopatterned LCs over the past few years. A brief review on photoalignment technology is presented and some of the recently developed photopatterning techniques suitable for generating complicated LC domains are  emphasized. Subsequently, fascinating microstructured LC domains with binary or space‐variant orientations are demonstrated. Novel optical fields, including arbitrary optical vortices, VBs, and Airy beams, are identified and characterized. The photoinduced LC domain engineering drastically extends the capability of optical field control and affords a promising approach for arbitrarily tailoring the wavefront. It is likely to improvise traditional LC optics and photon ics, and inspire promising innovations to this rapid developing field."

      "text" : "Since the first work on LC photoalignment in 1988 [45], tremendous improve ments have been made over the past 30 years [46]. Compared to conventional contact LC alignment techniques such as rubbing, photoalignment is more promising for high‐quality and high‐resolution multi‐domain LC alignment. Photoalignment avoids any mechanical damage, electrostatic charge, or dust contamination, and also possesses the ability for efficient LC alignment on curved or flexible substrates [46]. These years have witnessed a rapid develop ment in LC photoalignment. The commercially available photoalignment agents are now widely adopted in information display industries.\nLC photoalignment originates from the anisotropic intermolecular interac tions between the alignment agent with a photoinduced order and adjacent LC molecules. The photoalignment agents can be divided into four types according to the following different mechanisms: (i) photochemical reversible cis–trans isomerization in azo‐dye containing polymers [47–49], monolayers [50], and organic dye films [45, 51]; (ii) diffusion of azo‐dye molecules due to their chromo phore reorientation under the action of polarized light [52]; (iii) topochemical cross‐linking in cinnamoyl side‐chain polymers [34]; and (iv) photodegradation in polyimide materials [53, 54].\nOne photoaligning mechanism of azo‐dye photoalignment agents is the reori entation of azo‐dye molecules [52, 55]. The model of rotational diffusion is used to explain the azo‐dye reorientation under the action of polarized UV light. Here, we focus on a typical photoalignment agent, i.e. sulfonic azo‐dye SD1 [56] shown in Figure 11.2. The azo‐dye molecules with transition dipole moments parallel to the direction of incident polarization will most probably get the excess energy, which\nresults in their reorientation from the initial position. This results in an excess of chromophores with the absorption oscillator perpendicular to the recorded UV polarization. Hence, a thermodynamical equilibrium in the new oriented state will be established [52]. The orientation of SD1 will spread to adjacent LC molecules via intermolecular interactions and thus guide the local LC directors. The azo‐dye layers supply sufficiently high anchoring energy to LCs. Additionally, SD1 is photo‐rewritable and only the last written polarization information will be recorded. That will drastically facilitate the LC domain engineering."

      "text" : "During the past few years, several techniques suitable for flexible and high‐ resolution image output have been developed [41–43], facilitating the realization of complex LC domains that can present versatile optical functions. Figure 11.3 presents three photopatterning systems. As shown in Figure 11.3a, the first one enables arbitrary interferometric holographic recording via a modified Mach– Zehnder interferometer. The first polarizing beam splitter (PBS) separates the object (O) and reference (R) arms into orthogonal linear polarizations, which are then recombined by a second PBS. A quarter‐wave retarder is utilized to trans form the beams into orthogonal circular polarizations. The object is placed before the second PBS and interfered with the reference beam (usually a plane wave) to record its wavefront [6]. The second one directly writes the desired pattern by scanning a focused laser beam [43]. The laser direct writing system consists of a polarization rotator and a precise 2D translation system as depicted in Figure 11.3b.\nFigure  11.3c exhibits the third one, namely a digital micro‐mirror device (DMD) based dynamic microlithography system [41, 42]. The DMD consists of 1024 × 768 micro‐mirrors, each of which can be independently tilted by an elec trostatic force. These mirrors play the role of a dynamic mask. A uniform and collimated UV beam is reflected onto the DMD controlled by the computer. Subsequently, the bundle of light reflected by the “ON” state mirrors carries on the designed pattern. On subsequent focus by a 10× apo‐chromatically corrected projection lens and polarized by a motorized rotating polarizer, the beam then projects onto an LC cell or glass substrate spin‐coated with photoalignment films placed at the image plane. A charge‐coupled device (CCD) is utilized to collect the light reflected by the sample in order to monitor the focusing process. The optical path between the sample and the DMD is conjugated to that of the sam ple to CCD. Owing to the excellent flexibility of image‐output capability of the DMD, arbitrarily fine LC multi‐domains can be conveniently obtained.\nIn addition to the above techniques, some others have also been introduced to accomplish high‐resolution multi‐domain LC alignments. For example, the plas monic photoalignment technique enables patterning LC molecular directors with a diffraction‐limited spatial resolution and single exposure [44]. The reali zation of well‐fabricated LC domains is at the heart of all optical LC devices. These photoinduced LC domain engineering techniques make arbitrary tailor ing of optical fields possible."

      "heading" : "11.3 Binary LC Domains for Binary Optics",
      "text" : "Through an LC cell with locally controlled azimuthal angles, the same linearly polarized light will experience different phase shifts due to the angle‐ dependent efficient refractive index. The predesigned LC director distribution results in a patterned phase profile. Therefore, arbitrary optical elements in binary optics can be obtained by properly designing alternative LC domains. Usually, a two‐ step photo‐exposure process is performed [36, 58]. At first, the substrate or cell\n366 11 Photoinduced Liquid Crystal Domain Engineering for Optical Field Control\nspin‐coated with photoalignment layers is uniformly exposed with a linearly polarized UV light, and then is exposed again to receive the designed pattern with the polarizer rotating at a certain degree (for example, 90°). The exposed areas are realigned to be orthogonal to the first orientation. Therefore, the substrate(s) are synchronously imprinted with alternative 0° and 90° alignments consistent with the desired phase pattern.\nThe grating, a typical binary optical element, can be divided into two kinds: amplitude grating and phase grating. By introducing periodically orthogonal LC parallel alignment (PA) domains, binary phase grating is formed, while ampli tude grating can be formed by alternative twist nematic (TN) domains. In initial researches, micro‐rubbing [29–31], two‐step rubbing [32, 33], and holographic recording method [59, 60] have been adopted to produce these gratings. In 2012, Hu et al. [36] introduced SD1 into the formation of an orthogonal PA LC grating (Figure  11.4). Different domains in adjacent regions are achieved by two‐step photo‐exposure to guide orientations of SD1 layers and further align the LC mol ecules. Both one‐dimensional (1D) and two‐dimensional (2D) switchable phase gratings have been demonstrated. Its polarization‐independent diffraction is theoretically studied and experimentally tested. Such polarizer‐free gratings show very high transmittance (~92%), diffraction efficiency (over 31%), and opti cal contrast (over 150). The alternate PA/TN gratings are also demonstrated in cells placed between two crossed polarizers [61, 62]. Both 1D‐ and 2D‐tunable gratings are demonstrated. The work is based on the combination of phase and amplitude modulation. Some special LC materials, including dual‐frequency\nLCs [63] and ferroelectric LCs [64], are introduced to improve the response of these gratings. Thanks to the rewritability of the photoalignment agent, the opti cal function of these elements can be dynamically changed [65, 66].\nThe electrically tunable and switchable lens is desired for wide applications. LC lenses have attracted extensive attention. Among them, LC Fresnel lens is promising due to its outstanding electro‐optical performances. It can be realized by specifically aligning the LC directors to form a nonperiodic refractive index profile (Figure 11.5). Similar to those LC gratings, different alignment modes are adopted, including alternative PA and TN domains [67], single‐side‐patterned domains [68], and hybrid photo‐aligned domains [69]. Different LC materials are also employed, including ferroelectric LCs [70] and dual frequency LCs [69], to improve the performance of these lenses.\nLet us come back to grating. If a dislocation is introduced at the center, the so  called “fork” grating is obtained. It is a computer‐generated hologram of a Gaussian beam and an optical vortex (OV). OVs are characterized by helical phase fronts and donut‐shaped intensity distributions. Their unique helical phase fronts result in an orbital angular momentum (OAM) of mћ per photon [12]. More generally, they can be described by the so‐called Laguerre–Gaussian (LG) mode with two specific indices: the topological charge m and the radial index p. The OAM of OVs adds a new degree of freedom to the manipulation of light, leading to applications such as optical tweezers, quantum informatics, and OAM based optical communications [8, 9, 71]. With fork grating, a Gaussian beam can be conveniently diffracted into a series of OVs.\nLC fork gratings in various alignment modes with arbitrary topological charges are fabricated [58]. Figure 11.6 exhibits the micrograph and diffraction properties of a sample with m = 1. Thanks to the design of orthogonal alignment, the two perpendicular components derived from all incident polarization\nexperience the same refractive index change, resulting in an excellent polariza tion independency [36, 63]. A maximum efficiency of 37% (74% for total ±1st orders) is obtained (ON state) as shown in Figure 11.6c. Here, the obtained effi ciency is close to the theoretical limitation, and is significantly improved com pared to that generated by a commercial SLM. The dynamic switching between Gaussian mode and OVs can be easily accomplished through electrical tuning. Besides, the electrically tunable half‐wave condition makes the device suitable to a broad wavelength range. Since SD1 is optically rewritable, the pattern could be erased and then rewritten at the optical isotropic state to obtain a new holo gram. This means that the mode variation is also dynamic [58]. Ferroelectric LCs can be further introduced to accomplish a ferroelectric LC fork grating with the merit of ultra‐fast response [72].\n36911.3 Binary LC Domains for Binary Optics\nFor conventional grating and fork grating with only two phase regions in each period, the efficiencies of higher orders are quite limited, restricting their appli cations. Dammann gratings (DGs) [73, 74] can satisfactorily solve this problem. Each period of a DG is composed of certain binary phase regions of different widths. By optimizing the number and values of phase transition points, the light energy can be distributed into desired orders with good uniformity and high efficiency [75]. Such DGs can be realized by photopatterning LCs as well [76, 77]. The concept and implementation of DGs can be introduced into various optical elements based on phase modulation, such as circular grating and fork grating. On one hand, different‐order binary‐phase LC circular DGs with two mutually orthogonal photoinduced domains in every two adjacent alignment domains are proposed for generating annular uniform‐intensity optical fields (Figure  11.7a–c) [78, 80]. Such LC circular DGs exhibit merits of high effi ciency, good uniformity, and outstanding optical/electrical tunability. On the other hand, by encoding DGs into fork gratings, the so‐called Dammann vortex gratings (DVGs) are achieved. DVGs can provide equal‐energy OV array with specific OAMs at designed diffraction orders [18, 81, 82], enabling parallel OAM detection that is a key requirement in OAM based optical communica tions. The LC DVG featured by alternatively orthogonal PA regions is presented [79]. Figure 11.7d exhibits the micrograph of a 5 × 5 LC DVG with m = 1 & 1. The diffraction pattern at 632.8 nm in Figure 11.7e shows a 2D donut‐like OV array in high quality and good energy‐distribution uniformity. Thanks to the electro‐optical tunability of LCs, equivalent high efficiencies could be achieved\n370 11 Photoinduced Liquid Crystal Domain Engineering for Optical Field Control\nfor different wavelengths by slightly tuning the applied voltages. A case for 532 nm is shown in Figure 11.7f. These LC DVGs present excellent polarization independence, electrical switchability, and tunability, which are crucial charac teristics for OAM generation, manipulation, and detection.\nFor the above discussed binary LC elements, the desired phase profiles arise from dynamic phases introduced by the in‐plane optical path differences. Theoretically, the maximum diffraction efficiency for traditional binary optics is 40.5% for a single first order. To further improve the efficiency for optical field control, much higher phase orders between 0 and 2π should be adopted to maxi mally mimic a continuous phase modulation. These could be hardly realized via traditional SLMs which work based on dynamic phase modulation."

      "heading" : "11.4 Space‐Variant LC Domains for Geometric Phase Modulation",
      "text" : "Unlike a dynamic phase, the geometric phase (also named Pancharatnam– Berry phase [83]) originates from the spin–orbit interaction of light, i.e. the coupling between the polarization and the trajectory of light [84, 85]. The geo metric phase depends only on the geometrical characteristics and can be cre ated from inhomogeneous anisotropic media, such as LCs [6, 86] and anisotropic scatters based metasurfaces [19, 87, 88]. Usually, its magnitude is proportional to the orientation angle of the effective local optical axis, and has a polariza tion‐dependent sign. Arbitrary wavefront shaping can be realized by encoding the desired phase profile into the in‐plane optical axis orientations. As it is very easy to manipulate the optical axis for geometric phase elements, a continuous geometric phase change can be conveniently achieved. Therefore, the input energy can be 100% diffracted into a single order.\nAgain, we choose grating as an example. Polarization grating (PG) is a geomet ric phase element characterized by periodically and spatially variant optical axes. It is usually fabricated with LCs. As shown in Figure 11.8, the LC directors are homogeneous along the z axis and obey the following equation in the x–y plane: α(x) =  −πx/Λ [89], where Λ is the pitch of the polarization grating. The diffrac tion property of the PG can be obtained by Jones matrix calculation [4]. The PG has only three diffraction orders: ±1st orders and 0th order. The intensity distri bution among the three orders depends on the phase retardation Γ and the inci dent polarization. By adjusting Γ, switching between 0th and ±1st orders can be realized. If Γ = π, the incident linearly polarized light will equally diffract to the ±1st orders. If the input light is circularly polarized, only one first order will be obtained. In this manner, theoretically we can predict a 100% diffraction effi ciency for a single first order.\nTo accomplish such a space‐variant LC director distribution, polarization holography is usually adopted, which employs two orthogonally circularly polar ized beams [90–92]. The interferometric pattern is uniform in light intensity, but\nhas a spatially variant linear polarization obeying α(x) = −πx/Λ. After recording such a polarization hologram onto the photoalignment films, the director distri bution of the LC PG can be realized. Besides, the laser direct writing method and the DMD based microlithography can also be used [43, 93]. LC PGs can be applied in broad fields, including wide viewing angle displays, polarization beam steering, Stokes parameters measurement, and polarization image sensors [89]. Most recently, dual frequency LCs have been introduced to the design of PGs to realize fast‐response and high‐efficiency optical switch [93]; by integrating multidirectional LC PGs and multilayered functional LC polymer films, the high transmittance holographic polarizer is demonstrated with a transmittance effi ciency up to 90% [94].\nThe focusing/defocusing function of traditional LC lens is independent of inci dent polarization, while geometric phase lens can locally modulate the incident polarization states and result in a circular‐polarization‐dependent continuous lens phase profile [95, 96]. The theoretical optical axes of such a lens are homoge neous along the z axis and obey = + −( )/ r f f2 2 in x–y plane, where α is the azimuthal angle, r is the radius, r2 = x2 + y2, f is the designed focal length, and λ indicates the free space wavelength. Through Jones matrix calculation, the prop erty of the helicity‐dependent focusing/defocusing can be theoretically predicted. As shown in Figure 11.9, when the phase retardation satisfies the half‐wave condi tion Γ = (2n + 1)π (n is an integer), for a right circularly polarized (RCP) incident beam, the output is transformed into left circularly polarization (LCP) with a spherical phase profile, leading to a concave spherical wavefront. Thus, a focused beam is obtained. On the contrary, for an LCP incident beam, the transformed RCP is defocused. Such helicity‐determined lenses are promising in 3D displays, compact photonic spin filters [97], and multi‐spot focusing engineering.\nQ‐plate  [86, 98–100] is another attractive geometric phase element, which has been intensively studied in OAM‐lightened fields. Among various tech niques for OV generation, the q‐plate is especially promising due to the cou pling of spin angular momentum (SAM) and OAM [86]. It not only plays an important role in classical optics [101, 102], but also enables many quantum‐ optical applications [103, 104]. As shown in Figure 11.10, the q‐plate is a half‐ wave plate with space‐variant optical axis in the transverse plane, which follows α(r, φ) = qφ + α0, where r is the polar radius, φ is the azimuthal angle, and α0 is the initial angle when φ = 0. The number q, which denotes the changing rate of the optical axis with respect to the azimuthal angle, depicts the specific geom etry. The q‐plates will convert circularly polarized light into an OV (topological charge m = ±2q). When a circularly polarized light beam with OAM states of m traverses the q‐plate, an OAM variation of ±2qћ is imposed. Herein, the sign depends on the input polarization, positive for LCP and negative for RCP. The output polarization is sign‐inverted. The q‐plate will convert linearly polarized light into a VB  (polarization order P = 2q, depicts the degree of polarization symmetry) [99, 105]. Unlike OVs with phase singularity, VBs are featured by spatially variant polarization states and centric polarization singularities. They exhibit unique focusing properties thus enabling high‐resolution imaging and optical manipulation [10].\nOwing to the pronounced optical birefringence and controllable director dis tribution, LCs are the first choice for q‐plate fabrication. Recent years have wit nessed great progress in both the design and the fabrication of LC q‐plates. The objective LC orientations can be obtained via self‐assembled [106, 107] or extra‐ field‐induced [108, 109] LC topological defects, and circular rubbing or photoa ligning [99, 110]. In 2016, the concept of “meta‐q‐plate” was proposed, which enabled the arbitrary control of q and α0 along r and φ [57]. The meta‐q‐plate supplies a point‐to‐point beam shaping method, thus drastically enhancing the capability of manipulation of geometric phases. By further integrating the spiral geometric phase of the q‐plate with a PG, a geometric phase lens, or both of them, one can obtain a forked PG [111], a vortex lens [112], or a forked vortex lens [113]. These integrated geometric phase devices combine the features of polarization‐dependent diffraction, OV/VB generation, and focusing and defo cusing functions. Besides, vector vortex beams can be generated by stacking\ndifferent q‐plates and waveplates [114]. Both the topological charge and polari zation order of generated vector vortex beams can be controlled independently by stacking and reordering different optical films.\nBy encoding the phase profile of desired structured beams into the LC director orientations, arbitrary optical field shaping can be realized. Other examples include Airy beam [115] (Figure  11.11), Bessel beam [116], depolarized beam\n[117], and even complex hologram [6]. Airy beam exhibits features of non‐ diffraction, transverse acceleration, and self‐healing [11]. It has attracted consid erable interest in broad fields including optical manipulation, micro‐fabrication, and biology science. The geometric phase has been introduced to Airy mask to form an LC polarization Airy mask, in which the azimuthal angles of LC cubi cally vary along both x and y axes [115]. Via incident polarization control, switch between single‐ and dual‐branch Airy beams is realized. Their non‐diffraction and transverse acceleration features are verified. Furthermore, self‐healing and transverse accelerating OVs are generated via modulating Gaussian beams through subsequent LC q‐plate and polarization Airy mask [118].\nAll the above LC geometric phase elements are made of nematic LCs, which can be considered as a space‐variant wave‐plate. For such transmissive elements, half‐wave conditions should be precisely satisfied to maximize the conversion efficiency. EO tuning is necessary for matching different wavelengths, restricting their applications in fields with wavelength‐independency requirement.\nRecently, the spin–orbit geometric phase was discovered for the light reflected off planar cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) chiral superstructures  [119–122] (Figure 11.12). CLC is a topical liquid crystalline phase, where the rod‐like mol ecules self‐assemble into a periodic helical superstructure, contributing to a natural 1D photonic crystal. Thanks to the circular‐polarization selective Bragg reflection and the external‐field tunablility [123], CLCs have attracted much attention in versatile applications beyond mere displays [124–128]. For light propagating along the CLC helix axis, a circular‐polarization‐selective Bragg reflection is exhibited over a wavelength range nop~nep, where p is the helical pitch, and no/ne are the ordinary/extraordinary refractive indices, respectively\n[4]. The circularly polarized light with the same handedness as the chiral helix of CLCs is reflected, while the orthogonal one is transmitted. The reflective geo metric phase is attributed to the preservation of the polarization helicity from such circular Bragg reflection, which implies flipping of the optical SAM [119]. The magnitude of the reflected light phase is twice the local orientation angle of  CLC planar alignment and exhibits a CLC handedness‐dependent sign [120, 129]. Therefore, it supplies a new platform for broadband reflective geo metric phase manipulation. Similar to those in nematic LCs, via preprogram ming the CLC domains, planar reflective elements including light deflectors [121], lenses [121], and OV generators [122, 130] can be obtained."

      "text" : "Traditional geometric phases are usually limited to handling single‐structured beams and are unsuitable for parallel manipulation. If this challenge could be overcome, the capability for programming geometric phases and tailoring\n376 11 Photoinduced Liquid Crystal Domain Engineering for Optical Field Control\nstructured beams will be drastically extended. For instance, the creation of higher order Poincaré (HOP) sphere beam arrays would inspire multiple optical tweezers [131], parallel laser fabrication, and higher efficiency‐stimulated emis sion depletion microscopy [132]. The HOP sphere generalizes OVs and VBs, and vividly describes their higher order polarization states [133, 134]. Compared with traditional Poincaré sphere whose poles indicate two opposite SAM eigen states, the poles of an HOP sphere represent orthogonally circularly polarized OVs. Two such eigenstates are featured by helical phase‐fronts and OAMs. Each point on the HOP sphere is a linear superposition of them. Especially, the equa tor indicates VBs featured by space‐variant linear polarizations. The HOP sphere incorporates SAM and OAM, thus extending to a higher dimension angular momentum and adding a new degree of freedom to the manipulation of light.\nIn 2016, the concept of digitalized geometric phase modulation was proposed and demonstrated by means of digitalizing LC domains [135]. As shown in Figure 11.13, traditional space‐variant spiral geometric phase was digitalized by imprinting a particular binary phase referring to binary optics. With such digital ized geometric phase elements, HOP sphere beam lattices available for SAM and OAM parallel encoding are demonstrated for the first time. Through tuning the incident spin state, any point on the HOP sphere can be achieved, including spe cial cases of VBs and OAM modes. Square as well as hexagonal lattices with dif ferent desired orders are realized in high efficiency and good energy uniformity. By electrically tuning, the phase retardation can reach π at different wavelengths, making the digitalized LC domains wavelength‐tolerant. Besides, the electro‐ optical tunability of LCs makes it possible to dynamically switch between ON/ OFF states.\nThe idea is not restricted to Dammann encoded spiral geometric phase, and can extend to other integration of binary phases and space‐variant geometric phases, thus enabling tailoring of versatile optical beams. Actually, the medium is not limited to nematic LCs. Other natural or artificial birefringent materials could be adopted as well. As a special case, CLC chiral superstructures can be digitalized for advanced functionalities [136].\nCLC chiral superstructure exhibits unique features of polychromatic and spin‐ determined phase modulation. By encoding a specifically designed binary pat tern and emphasizing the spin‐dependent phase invariance, an innovative CLC OV processor is demonstrated. As exhibited in Figure 11.14, up to 25 different OVs are extracted with equal efficiency over a wavelength range of 116 nm. The multiplexed OVs can be detected simultaneously without mode cross talk or dis tortion, permitting a polychromatic, large‐capacity, and in situ way for parallel OV processing [136]. Such CLC domains exhibit versatile functionalities, and provide a satisfactory platform for OV‐lightened and other cutting‐edge territo ries, especially, the OAM‐incorporated wavelength‐division multiplexing (WDM), which is expected to dramatically expand the communication capacity [137, 138]. It is a vital step forward to extending the fundamental understanding and fantastic applications of ordered soft matters.\n379 References"

      "text" : "In addition to visible range, devices with structured LC domains are demon strated in the telecomm band [117] and THz range [139, 140] as well. Thanks to the broadband birefringence (visible, infrared to terahertz [141, 142]), further exploitation of the beam shaping extra visible range is still of great significance [143–145]. As the elements here are all induced by azimuthal angle control of LCs, the absorptive electrodes are avoidable; therefore the optical damage threshold will be drastically increased. In previous experiments, no damage was observed after 600 pulses (0.5 J cm−2, 1064 nm, 10 ns, 1 Hz) received [115, 146]. The value is one order higher than the damage threshold of commercial SLM. This means the LC domain engineering based optical devices are promising for short‐pulse intense‐light applications, such as light bullets and industrial laser processing.\nThanks to the rewritability of the photoalignment agent, the LC orientation can be reconfigured, enabling dynamic beam shaping. Besides photoinduced LC PA domains, TN domain based LC polarization converters, which consist of one uniformly aligned substrate and a counter one with space‐variant alignment, are suitable for arbitrary VB generation [22, 33, 147–149]. For most mentioned ele ments, traditional nematic LCs are used. In fact, the technique is compatible to various LCs, such as cholesteric, smectic [150], ferroelectric, and blue phases [151, 152]. Attempts toward new LC phases and materials is another meaningful topic.\nIn this chapter, recent researches about optical field control via photoinduced LC domains are briefly introduced. Some powerful photopatterning technolo gies are presented, which are very suitable for implementing accurate and arbi trary azimuthal orientation control of LCs. Not only binary, but also space‐variant LC domains are demonstrated for the generation, manipulation, and detection of novel optical fields with high quality, high efficiency, and with unprecedented flexibility. The objective LC orientations of the discussed photoinduced LC domains can also be obtained via external‐field‐driven [153], self‐assembled LC microdroplets or topological defects [106, 107, 154]. Compared to other tech niques, the photoinduced microstructured LC devices exhibit merits of compact size, easy fabrication, and low cost and are suitable for mass production. The technique drastically enhances the capability of optical beam shaping and steer ing, and settles a fundamental requirement in optics and photonics. Researches on this subject may further drive the need for optical field manipulation, and bring new opportunities in the fields of optical manipulation, high‐resolution imaging, OAM based informatics and quantum optics, and even some unchar tered territories."

      "heading" : "12.1 Why Azobenzene‐Based Photoactive",
      "text" : "Nano‐objects?\nOne of the most important goals in nanosciences and nanotechnology is greater miniaturization of information systems. This miniaturization of components for the construction of systems and machines used in everyday life is currently car ried out by a top‐down approach. This approach that leads physicists to manipu late or gradually transform material into small pieces by photolithography and related techniques has been carried out so far in a remarkable way. It is becom ing increasingly obvious, however, that the top‐down approach faces drastic limitations for dimensions smaller than 100 nm [1]. Even if this dimension appears very small for most experimenters, it remains very large at the level of atoms and molecules. An alternative and the most promising strategy to be exploited in science and technology to build nanostructures at the nanometer scale is the use of a bottom‐up approach. One of the ways to achieve the realiza tion of the nanometric structure by the bottom‐up technique is the controlled assembly or the self‐assembly of nano‐objects and the modification of these nano‐objects. Nature allows the assembly of molecules in an elegant and effi cient way by multiple noncovalent interactions. The bottom‐up approach is the mainstay in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. This is why chemists who are able to manipulate atoms and molecules are in an ideal position for the development of nanosciences and nanotechnology. The realization of surfaces containing micro/nanoscale objects or patterns offers the possibility to develop at a large scale new modifications and new possibilities of properties developed at the nanoscale with micro/nano‐objects. Toward that goal, polymer micro‐ or nano‐objects can be used as building blocks for self‐ or control‐assemblies that find applications in many fields of research including nano‐sensors, nanomede cine, or nano‐energy [2].\nAzobenzene Polymers as Photoactive Materials for Shape Changes of Micro/Nano‐objects Régis Barillé1, Ewelina Ortyl2, and Sonia Zielinska2\n1 Université d’Angers/UMR, MOLTECH‐Anjou, CNRS 6200, 2, Bd Lavoisier, 49045, Angers Cedex 01, France 2 Wroclaw University of Technology, Faculty of Chemistry, Department of Polymer Engineering and Technology, ul. Wybrzeze Wyspianskiego 27, 50‐370 Wroclaw, Poland\n390 12 Azobenzene Polymers as Photoactive Materials for Shape Changes of Micro/Nano‐objects\nIn terms of nano‐ or micro‐objects, we refer to micro‐ or nano‐scale objects as nanoparticles (NPs), colloidal spheres, nanorods, nanotubes, microwires, three dimensional posts, microspherical cap array, needles, polymeric strip, micro disks, etc. (Figure 12.1). The lithography technique used electrons (Ebeam), which is not suitable to transform the shape of polymer micro/nano‐objects or to pattern the whole curved polymer surfaces of microspheres, especially the bot tom parts of the surfaces. Further modifications of the surfaces of nanospheres are even less possible. So, conventional lithography techniques such as beam lithography methods or chemical methods, which are usually used to modify planar surfaces, are not very supportive to be used to pattern colloidal surfaces or similar size nano‐objects. Polymeric materials containing azobenzene and its derivatives (azochromophores) have been actively studied and developed in recent years [3]. We show how small objects representing different shapes and dimensions (0D, 1D, 2D) can be individually modified at the nanoscale leading to surface or shape changes.\nOne primary strategy to achieve the functionalization of a surface is to induce a pattern or to apply “a dimension‐controlled elevation” [4]. For the purpose of preparing functional polymer nano‐objects in terms of modification of surfaces, the light is used as a stimulus for photoinduced surface changes. The whole shape or part shape modification of surfaces is challenging and appears as a top\n39112.1 Why Azobenzene‐Based Photoactive Nano‐objects?\nresearch subject due to their potential scientific and technological applications such as drug delivery, chemical and biological sensors, or mechanical actuators. The modified surface could be used as a biological sensor. The detection method is based on the modulation of the diffracted light, which is caused by the interac tion between the light illuminating the biological analytes and the nanopatterned surface used as test platforms. Diffraction gratings on the surface can be pre pared either by nanopatterning an azopolymer‐responsive material into a peri odic array or by using this photopatterned surface as a duplication for different biocompatible materials. When the grating surfaces interact with the target mol ecules, either absorbed onto the surface or internalized within the gratings, the geometrical parameters of the gratings and/or the refractive index contrast is changed, which results in measurable changes in the diffraction efficiency (DE). The measurements rely on the values of the ratio between the diffraction inten sity in the first order with and without the analyte to be tested on the azopolymer grating. This methodology has been successfully used in the sensing of biomol ecules such as human immunoglobulin‐G (H‐IgG) detection [5]. The quantita tive detection of H‐IgG was achieved by detecting the modulation of the DE when the gratings were exposed to antigen solutions. The gratings showed high sensitivity and specificity for H‐IgG detection. Another potential application was the possibility to develop a new glucose‐sensing strategy by using diffraction‐ gratings of a stimuli‐responsive hydrogel bearing phenylboronic acid groups [6]. The gratings showed a fast and highly sensitive response to glucose in buffer solutions measured by the increase of the DE of the incident light. The saturated value was linearly correlated to the glucose concentration of the solutions. Authors claimed that this approach can be further explored to prepare various grating sensors for saccharide recognition and detection.\nAzopolymer nano‐objects contribute also to the design and development of low‐cost sensors that can either be embedded or surface coated in engineering structures to continually provide quantitative information. In particular, an example of azobenzene contribution is the measurement of moisture which is an important parameter in many applications such as agriculture, food quality assessment, and materials processing [7]. In these activities it is important to be able to continually access information on the moisture content. One example is the fabrication of an FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor using a custom‐ synthesized azobenzene‐based polymeric gel.\nThe information is acquired from the investigation of the strain behavior of the sensor in response to water absorption and desorption. The changes of strain and Bragg peak shift as a function of water ingresses by the gel. The application of the sensor for moisture detection in various materials could also be achieved.\nPotential applications of polymeric nano‐objects in the field of drug delivery have come into particular focus recently. The site‐specific drug release at the pathological location is highly important for cancer chemotherapy. If triggered drug release can be achieved in response to specific in vivo conditions in the case of tumors, which could improve drug deliveries and decrease side effects, with local treatments the challenges can be realized. The degradation by gastrointes tinal microflora of different azopolymers was studied by performing permeabil ity experiments on isolated films and solution viscosity measurements before\n392 12 Azobenzene Polymers as Photoactive Materials for Shape Changes of Micro/Nano‐objects\nand after incubation [8]. The conclusion was that polyurethane was found to be degraded in a culture of intestinal flora with the azo group. To reconfirm this, drug pellets containing water‐soluble drugs were undercoated with (carboxym ethyl)(ethyl)‐cellulose and overcoated with a segmented polyurethane contain ing azo aromatic groups in the main chain in order to examine the drug‐releasing profiles in the culture of intestinal flora. Colon‐targeted drug delivery and cir cumventing drug resistance are extremely important approaches for colon can cer chemotherapy. Azopolymeric micelles for colon‐targeted dimethyl fumarate (DMF) delivery in colon cancer therapy has been designed based on the pharma cological properties of DMF and azo bond in olsalazine chemical structure. DMF exhibited anti‐tumor activity on colon cancer cells. Azopolymeric micelles have been synthesized as a star‐shape amphiphilic polymer with azo bond and the fabricated DMF‐loaded.\nNano‐energy is an important research field with large applications in the reversibly storing solar energy. Azobenzene‐based nanostructures can be used to carry on solutions with molecular photoisomers, known as solar thermal fuels. A review is given by Zhang et al. [9]. The efficient capture, conversion, and storage of solar energy in the form of chemical bonds have potentially great interests. Recently it was shown that solar thermal fuels, with metastable forms by photoisomerization is capable of releasing close to 100% of the stored energy as the heat source under an external stimulus along with the reversion to stable forms [10]. A reversible transformation can transfer energy from and to the environment transforming the light into heat or a thermal storage of sunlight, respectively. This effect can increase the low storage capacity and short‐time storage of sun energy. A nano‐template with covalent attachment of new azobenzene chromophores on graphene is used as solar thermal fuels. The intermolecular hydrogen bond and proximity‐induced interaction, result from high functionalization density and inter‐planar bundling interaction, and lead to an improvement of both the storage capacity and lifetime. This nano scopic template exhibits a high energy density up to 112 W h kg−1 and long‐ term storage with a half‐life of more than one month (33 days). Novel hybrid solar thermal fuels have also been prepared through covalent linkage of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with azobenzenes, as demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally [11].\nIn the field of nano‐actuators for the purpose of deriving a machine or a robot in order to perform specific functions, azobenzene nano or micro‐objects can be stimulated by light to provide power and information [12]. Light is used as a stimulus to remotely supply energy and transport control information to the azobenzene‐based nano‐actuator or robot and is suitable to mode transform from light energy to mechanical energy (Figure 12.2). It was shown that a single film of a liquid crystal (LC) network containing an azobenzene chromophore can be repeatedly and precisely be bent along any chosen direction by using linearly polarized light. This is a very smart way of controlling the direction and degree of orientations of mesophase formation using the azobenzene photoisomeriza tion. This important photomechanical effect results from a photoselective vol ume contraction and is useful in the development of micro‐ or nano‐actuators for microscale or nanoscale applications, for example, when light can propel\nmicrorobots in medicine or optical catapult [16]. Most of the objects have the shape of strips and the light reversibly actuates the bending but some results have also demonstrated the possibility to induce movements with spiraling objects or rolling objects.\nRecently, a micro swimming robot was designed with a head and a flexible long flagellum with the whole length of 2.6 cm moving in a liquid‐filled tube with a low Reynolds number [13]. The swimming mechanism is similar to microorganism with a swing flexible oar‐like flagellum, for example spermato zoons. Additionally, a gripper was added on the robot head to introduce a func tion to grab and release loads. Another study explored further in the design of LC polymer films incorporating azobenzene molecules for the fabrication of\n394 12 Azobenzene Polymers as Photoactive Materials for Shape Changes of Micro/Nano‐objects\nstimulated light materials [14]. They modified the photophysical properties by incorporating azobenzene derivatives with fast cis‐to‐trans thermal relaxation into LC networks in order to accelerate the relaxation after photoisomerization. They showed that photoactive polymer films with this new molecular design can exhibit continuous, directional, macroscopic mechanical waves under con stant light illumination, with a feedback loop that is driven by self‐shadowing. They provide a mechanism of wave generation to the azopolymer thin film and demonstrate the potential application of the photoactive films in light‐driven locomotions and self‐cleaning surfaces.\nThe photoinduced motion called photomotility of thin strips of a photore sponsive polymer is made with an azo‐liquid crystalline network (LCN) com posed of 20 wt% of an azobenzene cross‐linker that transforms flat structures into spiraled ones under irradiation [17]. The material is anisotropic and the intrinsic granularity of the actuation mechanisms is done by a trans–cis photoi somerization at the molecular level. Owing to a twisted nematic orientation, the variation in the director profile offsets the alignment of the director to the prin cipal axes of the strips and results in the formation of spiraled shapes. The direc tionality of the photomotility is programmed by the orientation of the anisotropy to the principal axes of the specimens. The motion occurs without modulating or multiplexing the actinic light source. The material does not require any other special conditions other than its own capability to be actuated by directly trans ducing photons into motions.\nThe first light‐driven plastic mill was demonstrated [15]. It converts the incom ing light directly into a continuous rotation. This device is composed of four blades made of azo‐based LC polymer films able to bend under focused light irradiation and create a force causing the rotation of the mill. The study has shown that by accelerating the rate of the thermal Z to E back‐isomerization, macroscopic deformations with fast strain rate can be obtained. The rapid trans formation of the film under light is the key factor to perform the continuous rotatory motions of the mill.\nOther experiments have also observed the photomotility with other type of materials as crystals. The deformation is due to a change in crystal dimensions combined with local melting and can elicit crystal creeping across a surface, such as that observed with azobenzene crystals [18]. The motion is supposed to be driven by crystallization and melting at the front and rear edges of the crystal, respectively, via photochemical conversion between the crystal and liquid phases induced by the isomerization of azobenzenes. These crystals can crawl for around 15 μm in 10 minutes when they are exposed to 365 nm light. Another experiment involves objects floating on a liquid/air interface able to create motions [19]. The experiment is similar to the well‐known one with a camphor boat which is a self‐propelled system in which dissolution of camphor molecules from the solid attached to the boat generates spontaneous motion of the boat on the water surface. In this experiment, a crystal of a simple azobenzene (4‐methoxyazobenzene) moves on a water–air interface. The motion is triggered by irradiation with UV light. The maximum velocity of the boat was 5 cm s−1. The phenomenon is explained by the photoinduced crystal–liquid phase transition and dissolution of the cis‐isomer into water. The motion of the crystals or the\n39512.1 Why Azobenzene‐Based Photoactive Nano‐objects?\nboat continued even after the UV irradiation is stopped meaning that the motion is not caused by the heating effect.\nNanoparticles composed of a polymer network of azobenzene moieties with LC, capable of reproducible, photoinduced mechanical actuation was demon strated. A 20% height contraction of nanoparticles adsorbed on a substrate was obtained [20].\nThe advantages of liquid crystalline actuators are their ability to act similarly in dry and wet environment as well as their reversibility of mechanical actuations. The bending direction can be adjusted in two directions. However, the design of biodegradable azobenzene liquid crystalline actuators is not easy and is limited for in vivo applications.\nUntil now, we have shown that the control of azobenzene nano‐ or micro‐ objects can be moved on a glass surface or on the surface of a liquid. However, an important situation is the possibility to control the direction of nano‐objects in a 3D environment and in particular in a liquid even if this result has been partly shown with the directional control of azobenzene liquid crystal strip with a long flagellum The directionally controlled motion of nanosized polymer particles in an aqueous medium, as observed by fluorescence microscopy imaging was dem onstrated [21]. These NPs are specifically designed to reduce or eliminate the Brownian motion dominating the mechanical behavior in liquid. The nanosized particles consist of azobenzene‐dye‐decorated polymer nanoparticles in the 16 nm‐diameter range. The phenomenon in liquid with these nanoparticles is similar to the mass transport of the azopolymer when the surface is illuminated by interferences of a laser beam. The molecules move to the dark region and an accumulation of matter is observed corresponding to modulation of the photoin duced surface. The light‐induced isomerization of attached molecular motors leads to a motion toward the dark regions of the modulated illumination of the sample. The photomechanical energy conversion with optical control through light‐intensity gradients corresponding to the interferences illuminating the sample is transformed by the isomerizable dyes grafted on the particle surface as molecular propellers. The Brownian motion is reduced by the gradient force and can be used to explore active illuminated areas of the 3D medium efficiently, therebyleading to a directed motion. A power‐tunable velocity, over tens of micrometers toward the dark regions of the optical gradient can be obtained.\nKaneko et al. have demonstrated the phototactic behavior of micrometer‐sized oil droplets in a far‐from‐equilibrium state using photoresponsive surfactants [22]. The controlled motion of droplets was explained by heterogeneity in the interfacial tension at the droplet surface that was induced by the molecular pho toactive conversion of system components with the molecular structure of the photoresponsive surfactant containing an azobenzene. The negative phototaxis was very sensitive and exhibited a directional change within 0.5 second. Such sensitivity can find applications in the spatial arrangement of micrometer‐sized objects and also as transporters.\nAnother strategy is to create soft materials in which macroscopic motions of molecular assemblies are actuated by small amounts of molecular machines. A Japanese group has also reported reversible and spatially controlled photoin duced macroscopic motions of oleate assemblies containing smaller amounts of\n396 12 Azobenzene Polymers as Photoactive Materials for Shape Changes of Micro/Nano‐objects\nazobenzene with submillimeter lengths [20]. They prepare mixtures of oleic acid and oleate. The mixture exhibits a highly elastic response to mechanical stress because of the highly ordered stacking structure of oleate molecules in the assembly. They put azobenzene derivatives dissolved in oleate assemblies. Irradiation with 366 nm light induced a slight increase in the size of the vesicles. The vesicles were restored to the original size upon irradiation with 435 nm light. This reversible change in size is associated with the mechanical behavior of the azobenzene derivatives. The inner motion exhibited by the helical assemblies and the presence of an induction period strongly suggest that there are coopera tively propagating mechanisms such as domino effects occurring inside or at the surface of the supramolecular assemblies. It was assumed that the change in effective volume of azobenzene units by photoisomerization causes the propaga tion of expansion or contraction of inter‐molecular geometry among oleate molecules.\nThe mechanisms associated with azobenzene can be used to probe different phenomena, in particular, with the field of plasmonics. The fabrication of hybrid core‐shell nano‐assemblies involving a nondoped azophotochromic core coated with a dense shell of gold nanoparticles with a diameter of 140 nm was reported for investigating the influence of localized plasmons onto the azo‐core photoi somerization [23]. Such coupling causes a partial quenching of the azophotoi somerization but does not impact the thermal back relaxation.\nAzobenzene is a powerful molecule able to photomechanically modify nano‐ devices and nano‐objects. A brief summary of the main description of this mol ecule is then given in the following text."

      "heading" : "12.2 Azopolymer as a Photoactive Material",
      "text" : "Azobenzene used in the previously described experiments is an aromatic mole cule where an azo linkage (─N═N─) joins two phenyl rings. The name is often referred as “azobenzenes” or simply “azo”. A large class of compounds based on this molecule can be obtained by substituting the aromatic rings with various substituents, to change its geometry and electron donating/withdrawing charac ter. The most interesting behavior common to all azo‐based material is the effi cient and reversible photoisomerization, which occurs upon absorption of a photon within the absorption band. Azobenzenes have two isomeric states: a thermally stable trans configuration, and a meta‐stable cis form. Under irradia tion, a fraction of the transazobenzenes will be converted to the cis form, which will thermally revert to the more stable trans on a timescale dictated by the chemically engineering molecule substitution pattern.\nOne of the most interesting properties of the materials is the photoinduced mass transport [24]. When azopolymer films are illuminated by an interference pattern of coherent laser beams in the absorption band, a surface relief grating (SRG) can be formed on the film surface at temperatures well below the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the azopolymer. The photoinduced mass transport is caused by the repeated cis–trans isomerization of azochromophores under polarized light irradiation, which forces the chromophore to continually change\n39712.2 Azopolymer as a Photoactive Material\ntheir orientations. The deformation is then caused by the variation of the orien tation order and conformational change of the polymer backbones triggered by the photoisomerization of azobenzenes. The mass transport ends up with stabi lization of the molecular movements in a direction perpendicular to the polari zation. The photoinduced surface patterns or SRG in most of the cases are stable below the Tg and can be erased by heating samples with a temperature above the Tg or with an illumination with a circularly polarized laser beam. The SRG for mation is neither a thermally driven process nor an ablation of the surface and can be attributed to different phenomena depending on the azo materials and consisting in: (i) internal pressure gradients caused by an isomerization‐driven free volume expansion, (ii) a force based on the dipolar interaction of the azochromophores with the optically induced electric field gradient, (iii) a trans lational worm‐like diffusion caused by photoisomerization of the azobenzene chromophores, and (iv) a mean‐field force caused by molecule alignments.\nThe photoinduced orientation and related properties have been extensively investigated for various polymeric materials, such as azochromophore‐doping polymers (guest–host systems), azo‐functionalized liquid crystal polymers, and azo side chain to azo main chain amorphous azopolymers. Among them, pho toinduced deformations observed in different forms have boosted considerable research interest because of their unique nature and potential applications where small objects can transform their properties when it is remotely modified with a light stimulus. The deformations and modifications can be induced for any kind of objects at the nanoscale.\nGrebel‐Koehler et al. [25] introduced azobenzene photochromes into the core of rather spherical dendrimers, resulting in (quasi) isotropic nano‐objects that display significant changes in a hydrodynamic volume upon photoirradiation, with contractions as high as ΔVh = 37% as evaluated by a gel permeation chro matography (GPC).\nA recent study has shown that a photomechanical effect occurs in thin films of azopolymers called photofluidization appearing as a new possible mechanism to explain the formation of an SRG on azopolymer films [26]. The photoinduced pattern implies that the light force could drive the azopolymers to move at least within the sub‐micrometer scale. The photo‐softening effect of azopolymers upon light exposure was measured by in situ monitoring force displacement of a tip penetration [27]. The study revealed that azopolymers behaved like elastic solids without light irradiation and became viscoelastic under illumination. This photofluidization is anisotropic and depends on the polarization of the incident light. Another study found a photo‐expansion effect inducing reversible as well as irreversible changes in the mechanical properties of azopolymers. Photo‐ expansion based on repeated cis–trans photoisomerization generates a free volume in the surrounding polymer matrix. After multiple trans–cis photoi somerization, the total volume of azopolymer films is increased. The experiment was confirmed using neutron reflectometry [28]. Two competing photomechan ical effects in azopolymer systems were demonstrated: one that causes expansion of the polymer matrix, and one that induces contraction of the material. In this experiment it was able to measure the expansion and contraction effects since neutron reflectometry probes the physical density rather than the optical\n398 12 Azobenzene Polymers as Photoactive Materials for Shape Changes of Micro/Nano‐objects\nrefractive index. Later, a photoisomerization induced a softening of the polymer matrix followed by a polymer chain migration which well agrees with a study of nanoindentation with an AFM used for the acquisition of both surface time‐ dependent and time‐independent results. Indeed, their photoinduced surface patterning provides evidence of a plastic (or viscoplastic) photosoftening far beyond what thermal effects could be responsible for. The experiments on PMMA‐DR1 films [29] confirmed that the decrease of the irreversible viscosity by 1 order of magnitude is observed under illumination indicating that light strongly reinforces the viscoplastic behavior of the film. This was confirmed by indentation measurements. Additionally, the significant reduction of the com posite hardness under illumination indicates a significant decrease in the hard ness and/or plastic threshold (yield stress) of the material.\nDifferent models have been tested to account for the molecular motion phe nomena for amorphous polymers and liquid‐crystalline side‐chain polymers to explain the long‐term stability of trans–cis isomerization. We can refer to mod els to study SRG formation in azopolymer films based on the interaction between molecular dipoles [30]: the semi‐implicit moving‐particle model [31], random‐ walk model [32], a stochastic model [33], and a model based on Fick’s law of dif fusion as a phenomenological description of the molecular motion [34]. This last model is used to explain the self‐organization of photoinduced azopolymer sur faces when the light illuminates the samples. This model is based on Fick’s law of diffusion that scales with light intensity. Further, light is trapped in the sample and couples into counter propagating guided modes, which interact with the azopolymer. Using this approach, it is possible to explain the self‐patterning of the azopolymer film illuminated with a single beam and the surface profile and intensity evolution of azopolymer thin films during exposition to a single laser beam. The model is based on both the coupled mode theory and a phenomeno logical description of the molecular motion.\nA unified modeling framework for the light actuation on azo‐based materials was explained allowing for the understanding of surface deformation and bulk deformation of polymer films that are controlled by different laser beam polari zations: linear or circularly polarized light or a vortex shape of the laser beam [35]. It is shown that dipole forces strongly respond to polarized light in contrast to higher order quadrupole forces that are often used to describe SRG deforma tion through a field gradient constitutive law. Dipole forces strongly influence the evolution of trans and cis azobenzene states within monodomain and poly domain polymer networks. The coupling between the polymer network and azobenzene leads to significantly different photostrictive deformations."

Amphiphilic polymers are also well known for their ability to form other types of\n39912.3 Fabrication of Photoactive Nano‐objects\nstructures through self‐assembly processes. The incorporation of azopolymers into colloidal spheres, allows demonstrating that the colloidal spheres can show the photoinduced anisotropy function of the polymers and other interesting properties related with colloids.\nDifferent techniques are used to fabricate azopolymer nanospheres. The first experimental demonstration of the photoinduced deformation of azopolymer nanospheres was done by Wang and coworkers [36]. The colloidal spheres were prepared by a method similar to those used to obtain micelles and other self‐ assembled aggregates of amphiphilic polymers. The method of preparation of the colloid nanospheres is based on the technique of Zhang and Eisenberg [37] and consists in first dissolving the azopolymer in a good solvent for the chosen polymer, and then adding a suitable amount of milli‐q water dropwise into the solvent solution. When the water content reached a critical value, uniform col loidal spheres were obtained. The polymeric chains started to aggregate and form colloidal spheres. When the water content reached 40–50% (vol%), the polymeric chains collapsed gradually as the water content increased further. When micellization occurs, the nanospheres are dropped on a glass substrate. Density of the nanospheres on the surface can vary depending on the concen tration in the solution. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the nanospheres dispersed on the surface of a microscope glass slide is presented in Figure 12.3A. The external diameter measurement by a statistical analysis of the spheres can vary from nm to micron meter. With this method, different azo polymer spheres have been prepared and tested under laser illumination. An amphiphilic random copolymer functionalized with branched azo side chains has been prepared [41]. The microphase transition and structure formation are closely related with the water content in the systems. Other materials have been prepared such as four‐arm‐shaped amphiphilic azobenzene compound [42] epoxy‐based azopolymers [43], methacrylate‐based azohomopolymers [44], azopolyurethanes bearing push–pull type azochromophores [45], an amphiphi lic random azocopolymer (PEAPE), and a polydispersed azohomopolymer (BP‐ AZ‐CA), which were functionalized with azobenzene type and pseudo‐stilbene‐ type chromophores, respectively [46], or amphiphilic azobenzene‐containing random copolymer, poly(2‐[4‐(phenylazo)phenoxy]ethyl acrylate‐co‐acrylic acid) (PPAPE) [47]. Another study [48] shows that the electron‐withdrawing groups on the azochromophores have a significant influence on the photoin duced deformation behavior of the azopolymer colloids mainly through their modulation to the absorption band position. The colloid deformation can be more efficiently induced by irradiation with the laser beams at the intermediate wavelengths between the maximum and the absorption band tails of the azochromophores. Furthermore, the electron‐withdrawing groups can also affect the photoinduced deformation behavior through their influence on the hydrophilicity of the polymers. Another technique that produced azopolymeric microspheres used a glass capillary microfluidic device in which the outer phase can hydrodynamically focus on the inner phase, so as to result in droplet breakup in a dripping mode and subsequent generation of highly monodis persed oil‐in‐water single emulsions [49]. They used two differently sized injec tion orifices (20 and 100 μm in diameter) in microfluidic devices with a collection\n40112.3 Fabrication of Photoactive Nano‐objects\norifice 200 μm in diameter, wherein the inner flow rate (i.e. of the oil phase) was fixed at 300 μl h−1, and the outer flow rate (i.e. of the water phase) was varied. A typical azopolymer poly(disperse red 1 methacrylate) (pDR1) was selected for study. Two compatible oil‐phase solvents of toluene and chloroform were chosen for comparison with each other. After droplets of pDR1 emulsion were collected, the oil phase was allowed to evaporate at room temperature. They obtained highly uniform and smooth pDR1 microspheres considering the various microfluidic conditions (polymeric concentration within droplets, flow rate, and fluid).\nA novel method based on noncovalent bond self‐assembly technology pro vided hollow nanospheres with azo functional groups [49] (Figure  12.3C). Azocomplex nanospheres with a diameter of 300–1000 nm were obtained by the H‐bond (noncovalently) self‐assembly of poly(acrylonitrile‐stat‐4‐vinylpyridine) (PANstat‐P4VP) and azobenzene m‐methyl red (MMR) in aqueous solvents. Polymeric hollow nanospheres with azobenzene chromospheres were formed in the THF–H2O mixed solvent with 65 vol% H2O in mass. Azocomplex nano spheres with a diameter of 300–1000 nm were obtained. These hollow nano spheres exhibit potential as photoinduced deformation due to the azobenzene group.\nThe fabrication of complex architectures of the nano‐ or microspheres is also interesting and in particular micro‐ or nanoparticles possessing noncentrosym metric architectures like Janus particles (JPs) (Figure 12.4a). The name originates from ‘Janus,’ the Greek god with two faces.\nThe JPs consist of two distinct parts whose volume ratio is about 1 : 1, which is very close to the original feed ratio. Wang and coworkers have shown that JPs with the red part is the PAZO–ADMA phase and the transparent part is  the PMMA phase [39]. Owing to high incompatibility between the two polymers, the Janus nanoparticles with symmetric compartment volumes are obtained, meaning that two volumes are self‐assembled together forming two faces.\nIt is also necessary to reduce the interfacial tension between the dispersed droplets and dispersion medium with a suitable surfactant for forming snow man‐like particles. Azobenzene‐containing layer‐by‐layer films and microcap sules have been prepared with a range of cationic and construction of photosensitive devices. This review summarizes the syntheses of azobenze [51].\nAzopolymer microspherical cap arrays have been fabricated through soft‐ lithographic contact printing using colloidal arrays as masters and a duplicated PDMS elastomer as stamps [52]. The size of the microspherical caps can be fea sibly altered by adjusting the size of polystyrene (PS) colloids and the “ink” con centration. After irradiation of the linearly polarized laser single beam, the microspherical caps can be elongated along the polarization direction.\nMost of the experiments presented until now show that the nanoparticles are well dispersed on a surface of glass substrate. However, the attractive capillary force can cause the colloidal spheres to organize into hexagonally close‐packed 2D arrays or monolayers. One method is frequently used: the vertical deposition method in the goal to realize the capillary‐force‐driven self‐assembly. In the ver tical deposition method, a substrate, usually glass, is immersed vertically in\na  suspension containing colloidal spheres, which in our case, are azopolymer nanospheres [53]. By evaporation of the dispersion medium or lifting of the sub strate out of the suspension at constant speed, the surface of the liquid moves down and the colloids are deposited onto the substrate during the decline of the surface. The average size of the spheres was estimated to be 180 nm. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) has shown monomodal distribution for the sizes of the col loidal spheres.\n40312.3 Fabrication of Photoactive Nano‐objects\nThese assemblies of colloids on a surface can be used to design porous sur faces. The assembly of colloids can be used as a reverse surface [47]. Polymeric porous structures are very important for possible applications in selective trans portation, as biosensors and as photonic opal materials. It was demonstrated that the ordered mesoporous films can be obtained by in situ sphere‐pore inver sion of 2D arrays of the azopolymer spheres. The mesoporous films were obtained by placing the 2D colloidal sphere arrays in an enclosed chamber for solvent annealing for 6–9 hours. Before solvent annealing, the colloidal surfaces are composed of hexagonally close‐packed spheres. After the solvent treatment, the spheres are transformed to the mesoporous structure directly, which main tains the character of a hexagonal close‐packed array. The average pore diameter is 150 nm."

However, it is difficult to fabricate nano/microwires through a feasible approach. It was demonstrated that microwires with a uni form sub‐micrometer‐scale transverse dimension and macroscopic longitudi nal dimension, made of an epoxy‐based azopolymer can be fabricated through a soft lithographic approach [38]. The microwires can be processed by a laser beam in order to alter the transverse dimension of the microwires or inscribe regular surface relief structures on the microwires. First, elastomeric stamps made with PDMS (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) were prepared by replica molding. Then the azopolymer solution was deposited on the surface and the excessive liquid on the surfaces was removed.\nSheng et al. report the hierarchical self‐assembly of a cationic gemini amphi phile azobenzene compound in a composition gradient solution generated using solvent evaporation [54]. As the gradient solution is formed, the azobenzene compound forms nanorods in the lower region of the solution. Depending on solvent composition, these nanorods can be developed into nanofibers, which can then intertwine to form double helices and other types of nanohelices in the upper region of the solution. Macroscopic wire bundles can be formed by the fusion of nanohelices. These bundles exhibit photoresponsive properties that affect the deformation.\nTubular azopolymer nanostructures with controlled diameters were prepared by wetting porous anodic alumina membrane templates consisting in an array of parallel and straight channels [40] (Figure 12.3D). The alumina membrane filters have a typical diameter of 13 mm and thickness of 60 μm. The individual cylin drical pores can be viewed as a beaker in which a piece of the desired material can be synthesized. The pores in the membrane have monodispersed diameters of 200 nm. A nanocylinder of azopolymer can be obtained from each pore. The nanotubules were prepared by filtration of a solution of the azopolymer into the pores of the template membrane. About 1 ml of the azopolymer solution was dropped into a 1 cm2 area on the top surface of the template membrane. The membrane was left at ambient conditions until the solution was infiltrated through the membrane. It was then placed in an oven for solvent evaporation\n404 12 Azobenzene Polymers as Photoactive Materials for Shape Changes of Micro/Nano‐objects\nduring one hour at 60 °C temperature. Nanotubules were freed by dissolving the membrane by soaking in 3 M aqueous NaOH for 10 minutes. The difficult part was to eliminate the NaOH from forming crystals on the surface. Toward achiev ing this, azopolymer nanotubes were extracted from the resulting mixture by three 30‐second‐cycles of centrifugation at 8000 rpm, followed by two more cycles in distilled water. Nanotubules were then dispersed into water by sonica tion. The water suspension of dispersed nanotubules was then dropped on the surface of clean microscope glass slides and dried in an oven for water evapora tion (Figure 12.3D)."

The deforma tion is accompanied by an unprecedented decrease in hydrodynamic volume. Furthermore, the design of multi‐azobenzene rods with reduced solubility have led to the formation of spherical aggregates in organic solvents, which could reversibly be disrupted by alternating irradiation with UV and visible light.\nExotic nano‐objects can also be designed by illumination of a pre‐formed sur face [50]. Doughnut‐shaped nanostructures at the tailored surface of an azopoly mer film have been fabricated by an incoherent unpolarized light illumination (Figure  12.4b). The method chosen is a solvent‐droplet‐induced dewetting of thin azopolymer films on glass substrates. The contact of a thin polymer film to a solvent droplet reduces the glass transition temperature to below the room temperature as the solvent molecules penetrate into the film matrix. The stable polymer thin film is destabilized by the introduction of polar interactions and nano‐holes are created. Then an incoherent light is used for growing the nano structures and simultaneously directing the final shape of a nanostructure by the initial seed of tiny nanoscale holes rather than for optically erasing.

The surface of the microspheres can be photopatterned with illumination by interferences of a laser beam [56] (Figure 12.5D). The observation showed a grating on the surface of the microspheres and a contraction of the pores. It was shown that azopolymer nanotubes with a diameter of 100 nm present different surface deformations as a function of the laser beam polarization [40].\nAfter irradiation of an individual nanotube with a transverse electric field exci tation, the width is observed to shrink. Using an AFM profiling, the shrinkage is estimated to be about 60% of the initial width. With a p‐polarization the same\nexperiment was repeated. At the beginning of the process, the surface profile of the measured nanotube in the longitudinal direction is flat. After 30 minutes irradiation, the nanotube presents a quasi periodically structured surface.\nThe force exerted on azopolymer nanospheres to induce a deformation was calculated using the Hertz theory, which considers the contact deformation of elastic spheres under normal loads in the absence of adhesion and friction. A force of 1 μN was detected. It is an order of magnitude larger than typical forces needed for the deformation of hollow polyelectrolyte microcapsules using an atomic force microscope [58]. Moreover, the stress that is exerted on a polymer during SRG formation given by Toshchevikov et al. [59] was calculated. It yields a force of FZ ~ 2 μN onto the nanospheres, readings that are rather close to the estimation with the Hertz theory.\nOrtyl et  al. demonstrated that an assembly of colloidal azopolymer nano spheres could accelerate the process of SRG formation [57] (Figure 12.5B). One of the reasons is that the surface is already pre‐formed and the process of photo structuration starts on small nano‐objects. Only anisotropic photofluidization by polarized light deforms the nanospheres along the polarization direction. The phenomenon is amplified by the self‐lensing effect of the azopolymer nano spheres absorbing the laser wavelength. The single beam SRG formation is accel erated by the initial natural roughness of the colloidal assembly, suppressing the long incubation time usually observed in the spontaneous grating organiza tion. The subduction mechanism of nano‐spheres pushing each other along the\n406 12 Azobenzene Polymers as Photoactive Materials for Shape Changes of Micro/Nano‐objects\npolarization direction enhances the grating modulation amplitude. Altogether, exceptionally large and fast SRG formation gets self‐organized using a single beam irradiation in the colloidal nanosphere assembly. This method is a generic method and can be used for any material already tested during SRG formation on thin films. The preformed pattern on the surface of the azopolymer can also be used to photoaccelerate the structures of what was called nanodoughnuts\n407 References\n(Figure 12.6A). The light amplifies the structures and can modify the geometry with a nearfield setup.\nAmbrosio and coworkers have used light‐driven mass migration in order to reconfigure a pre‐patterned tridimensional superficial texture consisting in an array of azopolymer micropillars so as to induce a controlled directional wetting anisotropy [60] (Figure 12.6B). The wetting state of a water droplet onto the pris tine cylindrical pillar array is recognized as a result of the pinning effect of the triple‐phase contact line (TCL) at the sharp pillar edges. The experiment there fore shows the potential of using light parameters with the aim to design light‐ driven two‐dimensional wetting pathways onto the surface of a single pre‐patterned azopolymer pillar array. The last experiment shows that the directional aniso tropic wetting is transformed into a unique direction of the liquid spreading by a superficial hydrophilization treatment of the surface."

      "text" : "We have demonstrated the huge capabilities of nano‐objects made with azo benzene or azopolymers. In particular, we have shown that the mechanism of the photo‐orientation of azo molecules can induce mechanical actions. These mechanical actions can be further used for directional movements of micro/ nanosystems or display significant changes in volume [61]. We have reviewed the different nano/micro‐ objects obtained up to now including azobenzene in their designs. In terms of nano‐ or micro‐objects we have presented the fabrica tion and use of micro‐ or nanoscale objects as nanoparticles, colloidal spheres, nanoparticles, nanorods, nanotubes, nano/microwires, three dimensional posts, microspherical cap arrays, needles, polymeric strips, micro disks, etc. All these nano/micro azobenzene based objects can find applications in different media. Large possibilities of applications can be developed and can, in particular, open the way for future applications concerning the future of nanotechnology in sen sors, nano‐medicine or nano‐robotics. We can imagine, for example the recon figuration of subdevices with light like metamaterials to match different optical properties such as chirality or can imagine nanorods as nano reconfigurable barcodes. The inclusion of emitting compounds in azopolymer nanotubes can be tuned by opto‐mechanically changing the volume of the nanotube."

      "text" : "The process of encapsulation involves the incorporation of active ingredients into a relatively small capsule or particle. Such systems are employed for various reasons such as enhancing the stability of specific active ingredients by delaying their degradation, protecting species from substances that could prematurely react with them, improving the processability of materials by altering their phys icochemical properties, or even for safe handling of toxic components [1, 2]. Encapsulation technologies are also available for the production of systems incorporating controlled‐release properties. In general, controlled release refers to the presentation of compounds in response to stimuli at a desired time, and at a specific rate (delayed, sustained, or even pulsed release). A timely and targeted release improves the effectiveness of the actives, ensures optimal dosage, and broadens the application range of ingredients. In many occasions, localized release allows reduction of the total amount of active ingredient that must be delivered to achieve the desired effect. Controlled release is pursued in a number of areas including agriculture, food sciences, and pharmaceuticals.\nExternally triggerable encapsulants have been engineered to address these challenges and a wide palette of inputs can be used as triggering events including changes in pH, temperature, and magnetic fields, and the presence of specific chemical species. In this regard, light is an efficient and clean stimulus. Light‐ controlled substance release, as compared to other mechanisms, is attractive in many ways. It is a versatile stimulus, which can act in a noninvasive fashion and provides excellent spatiotemporal control by means of modulation of properties such as wavelength, intensity, and polarization. Light also shows a high degree of orthogonality toward a great deal of chemical species and functionalities [3]. Indeed, light has gained significant interest as a trigger in drug encapsulation and delivery on account of its clinical relevance (light has a number of therapeutic uses and it is currently used in photodynamic therapy [4]).\nLight‐Controlled Encapsulation and Release Enabled by Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies Jesús del Barrio1, Milagros Piñol2, and Luis Oriol2\n1 Instituto de Nanociencia de Aragón, Campus Río Ebro. Edificio I+D. C/ Mariano Esquillor, 50018 Zaragoza, Spain 2 Departamento de Química Orgánica, Facultad de Ciencias, Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Aragón, Universidad de Zaragoza‐CSIC, C/Pedro Cerbuna 12, 50009, Zaragoza, Spain\nAs illustrated in Figure 13.1, several parameters need to be considered when formulating encapsulated products, which also applies to light‐controlled sys tems. The physicochemical characteristics of the encapsulated species and its functionality in the final product, the appropriateness of the encapsulating pro cess with respect to the stability of the actives, the physicochemical properties (size, shape, surface chemistry, etc.) and storage conditions of the final product, the release‐trigger mechanism and scalability, and cost constrains are all impor tant aspects of encapsulating systems. A further step in the design flow (Figure 13.1) involves the comparison and contrast of design elements and appli cation specification. In such a process, a set of characteristics, like the type of encapsulant material, the concentration of the active ingredient, and the type of process to produce the formulated product, need to be selected for the preferred system. A wide range of encapsulation processes exist such as atomization, cocrystallization, emulsification (liposomes, interfacial polymerization, etc.), and inclusion complexation, and each of them has its own set of limitations and advantages and disadvantages. On the materials side, it is possible to differenti ate between inorganic and organic materials including surfactants, polymers, oligomeric, and macrocyclic species. In many instances, the applicability of a specific encapsulation method or cargo‐release mechanism is constrained to a very limited set of materials, which evidences the complex interdependencies between processes and materials.\nThere exist excellent recent reviews on photocontrolled delivery systems [5– 8]. Considering the framework of this book, we highlight several polymer‐based encapsulating systems exhibiting light‐controlled release capabilities. In this chapter, rather than being comprehensive, we focus on those aspects and attrib utes of photoresponsive polymer materials that make them particularly attrac tive for the delivery and controlled release of active ingredients, mainly pharmacological formulations. Our goal is to provide a general sense of current research and to assist the reader in the identification of trends and challenges facing the development of practical photoresponsive polymer‐based delivery\n41513.2 Photoresponsive Groups\nsystems. We begin this chapter by discussing some generalities of the design of light‐responsive polymeric encapsulants (Section  13.2). Looking toward the application of light switches and photoinduced reaction in polymeric encapsu lants, the families of polymer micelles and vesicles (based on amphiphilic block copolymers, BCs), capsules, microgels, nanogels, nanoparticles (NPs), and uni molecular systems will each be discussed in turn (Sections 13.3.1–13.3.6)."

      "heading" : "13.2 Photoresponsive Groups",
      "text" : "In the framework of this chapter, the realization of light‐controlled substance release requires the polymeric materials, e.g. amphiphilic BCs, which are typi cally capable of undergoing micellization in aqueous media, that they include at some point in their macromolecular architecture at least one photoresponsive chromophore [9–11]. Changes or reorganizations of the chromophore structure can be selectively induced with light (UV, vis, NIR), which result in temporally and spatially controlled substance delivery. This process depends, more com monly, on the light wavelength, intensity, and irradiation time. In general, three major photoinduced changes may be induced in polymeric nanocarriers. These include (i) a local polarity change (typically associated with a change of the over all hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the encapsulant [see Figure 13.2]), (ii) a photoinduced degradation of the polymeric structure via selective cleavage of photolabile bonds, and (iii) the photocrosslinking of specific polymeric compo nents (see Figure 13.2). Furthermore, these photoreactions can be reversible or irreversible [12, 13].\nThe reversible trans–cis–trans photoisomerization of azobenzenes has been widely used for the preparation of photoresponsive materials due to the high synthetic versatility and stability of these compounds. As the cis isomer has a bent geometry and a higher polarity than the trans isomer, photoisomerization is accompanied by local polarity changes in the system which, without necessarily achieving a complete distortion the self‐assembly, increases the level of molecu lar mobility and induces cargo‐release. UV light is used more commonly although the photoisomerization of azobenzenes with visible light has also been described [14–16]. The photoinduced reversible ring opening/closure of spiropyrans can also alter the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance of a given system, sometimes to a larger extent, as the open merocyanine form is zwitterionic in nature. Irreversible photoreactions such as the Wolff rearrangement of diazonaphtoquinone (DNQ) or the photocleavage of o‐nitrobenzyl, perylenylmethyl or coumarinyl esters can also induce substantial local polarity changes. Furthermore, chromophores as DNQ or coumarins can also be efficiently stimulated via two‐photon processes using NIR light (650–900 nm), which is interesting for systems of biomedical rel evance, as NIR light exhibits deeper tissue penetration (up to 10 cm in some cases) than UV light (c. 1 cm).\nThe light‐induced degradation of a polymer system typically relies on photo cleavable chromophores, which can specifically serve as a bond connecting two blocks of different nature (as in BCs) or randomly distributed along a polymer backbone. O‐nitrobenzyl derivatives are usually selected for this purpose due to\ntheir high synthetic versatility. Finally, some photocrosslinkable moieties as cou marins or cinnamates can be used to induce changes on the macromolecular self‐assembly and stability that occur due to cross‐linking‐induced shrinkage. Coumarins are particularly useful for this purpose as they undergo reversible photocrosslinking using UV light. Other chromophores such as dithienylethenes have been evaluated in the search for photoactive macromolecular materials, including applications as nanocarriers [17]. When looking toward biomedical\n41713.3 Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies for Encapsulation and Release\napplications, other aspects must be considered in addition to the light‐response of the chromophore such as the cytotoxicity of the polymer, which is particularly relevant in the case of photolabile and degradative moieties. Indeed, the genera tion of nitroxobenzaldehyde derivatives may induce cell death as it has been reported for o‐nitrobenzyl‐containing polymer micelles exhibiting phototrig gered cytotoxicity [18].\n13.3 Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies for Encapsulation and Release"

      "heading" : "13.3.1 Polymer Self‐Assemblies from Linear Amphiphilic BCs",
      "text" : "One of the most common materials for the production of polymeric encapsu lants are amphiphilic BCs, which are defined as polymers consisting of at least two immiscible blocks (frequently, one hydrophobic and one hydrophilic). When a BC is dispersed in a liquid that is a “good” solvent for one of the blocks and, at the same time, a precipitant for the other, the BC associates in a reversible fash ion forming self‐assemblies (micelles and vesicles) of various shapes and dimen sions, which to some extent are similar to those of low molecular weight surfactants. BC micelles consist of a collapsed core of the insoluble block and a corona of the soluble block. When water is used as a solvent, and depending on the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the BC, spherical, ovoid, lamellar, worm‐like and rod‐like micelles have been found to form spontaneously. In such species, encapsulation of hydrophobic cargo at the micellar core can be readily achieved. Polymer vesicles are particularly relevant self‐assemblies for encap sulation applications. They are composed of a bilayer of amphiphilic species enclosing an aqueous compartment. Hydrophilic actives can obviously be trapped inside the interior lumen, but there also exists the possibility of encap sulating hydrophobic cargo substances at the vesicle wall (a combination of both modes of encapsulation is also possible). In addition to the hydrophobic/hydro philic ratio, there are other parameters that play a role in determining the self‐ assembly morphology and structure including the establishment of secondary interactions (hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking, etc.) or the crystallization of the core‐forming block. Amphiphilic BCs exhibit substantially higher molecular weight as compared to lipids, thus leading to a less dynamic, more robust and mechanically tougher membrane than surfactant‐forming micelles. In addition, BCs can be easily functionalized at either the polymer ends or side chains pro viding a useful approach to the modulation of specific properties such as mem brane permeability or the incorporation of stimuli‐responsive features, including photoresponsive moieties. Regarding the preparation of polymer self‐assem blies, a variety of different methods have been explored. Two of these are prefer entially used and are the film rehydration and the solvent switch methods. In the latter, the BC is initially dissolved in an organic solvent that is “good” solvent for both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks, followed by the addition of an additional solvent (typically water), which selectively induces the collapse or nanoprecipitation of the solvophobic polymer block. Several parameters such as the\n418 13 Light‐Controlled Encapsulation and Release Enabled by Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies\ntype of organic solvent, solvent to water mixture ratio, and mixing rate may affect specific characteristics of the final system including the morphology and permeability of the hydrophobic domains (core of a spherical polymer micelle; and wall, in the case of a polymer vesicle). A final purification step is generally performed where the residual organic solvent is removed by dialysis or is allowed to evaporate. The use of organic solvents is undesirable for in vivo applications or for the encapsulation of specific bioactive compounds. The film rehydration is, to a certain extent, a method which minimizes the use of organic solvents. Here, a thin polymer film is rehydrated in aqueous media in bulk or by means of electrical methods (electroformation). Again, the method of choice will depend upon factors including size as well as the nature of the polymer and the active ingredient. Alternatively, micellization can also be achieved by less conventional methods including pH and temperature switches, and through the complexation of polyelectrolytes. The use of microfluidic, nanoimprinting and centrifugation technologies has also been described.\nOn amphiphilic BC self‐assemblies, the response to light depends on the type of transformation induced by light and the location of the photosensitive unit into the BC. The chromophore is usually located at the blocks junction or as a pendant moiety of one of the blocks, usually the hydrophobic one, either as a repeating unit or as a side‐chain. There is a wide variety amphiphilic BC designs and all combinations of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers are possible. The number of hydrophobic blocks studied to construct amphiphilic BCs is rather large; nevertheless, considering potential in vivo applications, degradabil ity is a critical aspect [19]. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is most commonly used for the hydrophilic segment as, in addition to being biocompatible, it is resist ant to immunological recognition, thereby improving circulation times. Alternative  hydrophilic and responsive polymers, such as thermoresponsive poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) or poly(N‐isopropy lacrylamide), may also be considered for the design of nanocarriers operating under multiple combined stimuli. Systems that are able to respond to more than one stimulus provide the opportunity to selectively regulate the release of various cargoes independently or induce a burst release by combining the effect of several of them, which greatly enhances the versatility of the systems in practi cal applications [20]. Indeed, temperature is a convenient stimulus that can trig ger a reversible hydrophobic‐to‐hydrophilic transition and has been frequently combined with light stimulation.\nOne approach consists of the utilization of a photocleavable unit to cova lently  link the hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments of an amphiphilic BC (Figure 13.3). An irreversible photolysis at the linker breaks up the copolymer into their individual constituent blocks, which is accompanied by the destabiliza tion of the self‐assemblies and cargo‐release. The vast majority of the reported examples have used o‐nitrobenzyl‐ based linkers. Under UV or two‐photon NIR absorption, the o‐nitrobenzyl moiety cleaves at the benzylic site and disrupts the polymer micelles or vesicles. The performance of amphiphilic poly(acrylic acid)‐ b‐poly(methyl caprolactone) diblock copolymer (1 in Figure  13.3) vesicles as phototriggerable nanocarriers was tested using hydrophilic fluorescent probes and proteins [21]. Vesicles disintegrated into small micelles upon exposure to\nlight (λ = 365 nm) concomitantly to cargo‐release. The authors also demonstrated a light intensity dependent release, which enabled some level of control over the release process. In an attempt to achieve multi‐stimuli‐responsiveness, ABC‐ type triblock copolymer combining a o‐nitrobenzyl unit with a disulfide bond, one at each block junction, were described to generate micelles in aqueous media where a combination of reducing agent and UV light induced significant disrup tion of the micelles [22]. With this system, the release profile of Nile Red was tuned depending on the sequences in which the stimuli were applied. An analo gous approach was followed for the design of light‐responsive vesicles based on a 2‐nitrophenylalanine linker connecting a block of polycaprolactone with a block of PEG. After analyzing the encapsulation and release properties of the vesicles in aqueous media using biocytin, it was suggested that copolymer pho todissociation induced a gradual collapse of the vesicle membrane which resulted in the precipitation of polycaprolactone aggregates [23].\nPhotoremoval of o‐nitrobenzyl functionalities was used to activate self‐ immolative processes due to end‐to‐end backbone depolymerization [24, 25]. The principle was applied to ABA‐type amphipilic triblock copolymers of PEG‐b‐poly(ethyl glyoxalate)‐b‐PEG with o‐nitrobenzyl units at the junction blocks. Nile Red and doxorrubicin (DOX) were used to demonstrate the encapsulation and release properties associated with the light‐triggered disintegration of the micellar self‐\n420 13 Light‐Controlled Encapsulation and Release Enabled by Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies\nassemblies [26, 27]. The same principle applies to the concept of self‐immolative vesicles using amphiphilic diblock copolymers having a hydrophobic block whose cascade depolymerization is triggered in this case by a pyrenyl or an o‐nitrophe nyl photocleavable terminal group [28].\nA few recent examples have demonstrated the utility of boron‐containing pho tolabile linkers. Patil et al. have reported the synthesis of a PEG‐b‐polystyrene amphiphilic BC with a photolabile boron dipyrromethene linker (2 in Figure 13.3), which exhibits a clear absorption band in the visible range. Disassembly of the micellar self‐assemblies was monitored by encapsulation of Nile Red, and its triggered‐release capabilities under light (λ = 470 nm) irradiation was demon strated [29]. A boronate ester linker, from a boronic acid and nitrocatechol end‐ functional polymers (3 in Figure  13.3), was used by Coumes et  al. to impart multiresponsive (pH, UV light, and sensitivity toward carbohydrate molecules) properties to the BC self‐assemblies. The potential of the self‐assemblies as drug delivery nanocarriers was evaluated using Nile Red [30].\nInsertion of photocleavable groups along the main chain of the hydrophobic block induces the breakdown of the hydrophobic backbone into smaller frag ments allowing for the release of cargo, which has been proposed as a more effi cient strategy to achieve a burst‐release effect [31]. Han et al. have reported the synthesis and self‐assembling properties of a series of ABA amphiphilic triblock copolymers, where the B block contained multiple photolabile o‐nitrobenzyl repeating units along the polymer backbone (4 in Figure  13.4). The triblock copolymers had the capability to undergo self‐assembly in aqueous media yield ing core–shell micelles, which could be degraded upon exposure to UV light. The encapsulating capabilities of the systems where initially evaluated with hydrophobic fluorescent probes [32, 33]. Han and coworkers also prepared DOX‐loaded micelles that showed enhanced anticancer activity against tumor cells after UV illumination [34]. In addition, use of light was shown to be a more effective method to induce release than pH. Micelles disruption triggered by main‐chain photodegradation of a polyurethane hydrophobic block has also been reported using DOX to demonstrate the encapsulation and efficient release of hydrophobic payloads [35]. Pasparakis et  al. have reported the synthesis of\n42113.3 Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies for Encapsulation and Release\npolyacetals and polyketals, which can undergo main‐chain photocleavage with very low energy inputs. These systems were tuned to make them sensitive to vis ible light through the derivatization with 2‐nitroresorcinol moieties, which are in close proximity to the acetal moieties (5 in Figure 13.4) [36]. BC micelles based in these polyacetals were capable of encapsulating and releasing camptothecin and hematoporphyrin via two‐photon absorption photolysis (λ = 532 nm) in a process that was accelerated at low pH.\nAnother general approach consists of the attachment of light‐sensitive chromo phores to the backbone of a polymer chain or segment of a BC.\nThe polarity of these side‐chain moieties can be switched from hydrophobic to hydrophilic by using light irradiation. Lightinduced changes of the pendant chromophores can switch the polarity of the segment from hydrophobic to hydrophilic (or vice versa), inducing the destabilization of the self‐assembly and the release of any encapsulated active. This strategy has been vastly explored because it is possible to easily combine several units at the hydrophobic block creating multiresponsive polymeric carriers where release can be regulated by applying either one or a combination of two or more stimuli. These polymers can be synthesized via direct polymerization of functional monomers or by post‐ polymerization functionalization of macromolecular precursors. The second approach requires a polymeric skeleton with chemical groups that are suitable for efficient functionalization with several chromophores. This offers versatility versus the polymerization of functional monomers. Several of these systems consist of a PEG‐b‐poly(meth)acrylate BC where the hydrophobic poly(meth) acrylate carries a number of light‐responsive moieties (Figure 13.5). Upon expo sure to light, the pendant photocleavable groups, including pyrenyl [37], o‐ nitrobenzyl [38], and coumarin [39], undergo a photoinduced reaction that leaves a highly polar carboxylic acid/carboxylate residue at the polymer chain. Thus, micellar self‐assemblies with the core formed by the hydrophobic block are unable to retain self‐assembly and the release of any physically entrapped\n422 13 Light‐Controlled Encapsulation and Release Enabled by Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies\nactive can take place. Florescent Nile Red has been used to verify the controlled release of payloads.\nRecently, the development of polymeric nanocarriers that are triggerable at the visible or the NIR wavelength range has been identified as a key step forward toward the realization of systems with relevant biomedical applications. In this sense, the photolysis of o‐nitrobenzyl moieties is possible via one‐photon UV absorption or two‐photon NIR absorption; however, the rate of release is slowed down in the latter case due to inefficient two‐photon absorption [15]. Micellar systems using coumarin with larger two‐photon absorption cross‐section can also be used as NIR light‐triggered systems due to disruption of micellar self‐ assemblies after photolysis [16]. Additionally, coumarins can dimerize by revers ible photo[2 + 2]cycloaddition activated by UV and visible light. The process affords stabilized micelles and controlled‐release capabilities by photoregulated micelle core cross‐linking–decross‐linking [40].\nAzobenzene is one of the most popular photoswitches for light‐triggered applications. As the photoinduced process is reversible, micellar dissociation may be partially reverted. Additionally, azobenzenes with electron‐donor or electron‐acceptor groups enables the production of micelles that are sensitive to visible or NIR light [41]. Similarly to azobenzene, spiropyran can undergo revers ible photoisomerization, which may lead to the disruption and regeneration of polymer micelles [42]. Encapsulation, UV light stimulated release, and visible light stimulated re‐encapsulation by amphiphilic BC micelles have been demon strated using coumarin 102.\nIn the pursuit of multi‐stimuli responsive systems, Yang et al. have reported the synthesis of a poly(N‐isopropylacrylamide)‐b‐poly(2‐nitrobenzyl meth acrylate) BCs where the hydrophilic poly(N‐isopropylacrylamide) is responsive to temperature and the hydrophilic poly(2‐nitrobenzyl methacrylate exhibits photolabile groups. Micelles based in this BC exhibited release capabilities, which could be tuned in a two‐way manner by changing either the temperature or the irradiation conditions [43]. Light‐ and temperature‐response groups can be both introduced in the same hydrophobic poly(meth)acrylate block by copo lymerization of suitable monomers, such as N‐isopropyl acrylamide [44, 45], or post‐polymerization functionalization of a preformed thermoresponsive hydro phobic block. Indeed, Chen et al. have decorated a PEG‐b‐poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) with DNQ moieties that converts into 3‐indenecarboxylic acid upon exposure to UV light [46]. The biocompatibility of these micelles was evaluated on HepG2 and HUVEC cell cultures and controlled‐release proper ties were confirmed using the hydrophobic model coumarin 102. An analogous system was reported by Li et  al. which uses poly(dimethylaminoethyl meth acrylate) (PDMAEMA), a temperature‐ and pH‐responsive polymer, as a hydro philic block [47]. Multi‐stimuli responsive micelles capable of encapsulation release coumarin 102 under both UV and NIR light stimulation were obtained through the partial functionalization of the PDMAEMA block with DNQ moieties. Cargo‐release was enhanced under the combined stimulation of pH and light. The vast majority of BCs micelles include one hydrophobic poly(meth)acrylate polymer chains in their structure, which is appropriate for proof‐of‐concept\n42313.3 Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies for Encapsulation and Release\nstudies. However, the lack of biodegradability significantly hampers any potential in vivo applications. This limitation is stimulating research to develop photoresponsive BC nanocarriers based on biodegradable polymers such as polycarbonates [48–50] or polypeptides [51–54].\nUnlike micelles, vesicles are capable of transporting hydrophilic and hydro phobic cargo, either packaged inside the lumen or embedded within the vesi cle wall. In these systems, light‐responsive hydrophobic blocks that enable the regulation of the permeability and cargo‐release capabilities is an attractive strat egy [55]. Wang et al. reported a couple of studies of amphiphilic diblock copoly mer vesicles with a PEG shell and a spiropyran or an o‐nitrobenzyl‐ functionalized polymethacrylate‐based wall. Concurrent light‐triggered reactions at the polymer‐ forming wall enabled the release of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic actives. The release capabilities of the systems were also evaluated in vitro and in vivo [56, 57]."

      "heading" : "13.3.2 Polymer Self‐Assemblies from Linear‐Dendritic and Branched BCs",
      "text" : "Interest in linear‐dendritic block copolymers (LDBCs) arises from the combina tion of the easy synthesis and the excellent processability of conventional linear polymers with the well‐defined branched structure of dendrons, which is charac terized by a precise and high number of peripheral ending groups [58]. Their unique macromolecular architecture and the derived hierarchical self‐assembly properties are responsible for them gaining significant interest in bionanotech nology, e.g. drug or gene delivery [59–63]. Furthermore, the chemical modifica tion of the peripheral groups allows to introduce the exact number of functional moieties, which facilitates providing functional properties to the resulting mate rials. Limitations in the development of these BCs arise from their challenging synthesis. However, the synthesis of functional LDBCs may be achieved via direct coupling of preformed blocks. This coupling strategy requires implemen tation in two complementary clickable groups, one at one end of the linear block (or both ends in dendritic‐linear‐dendritic BCs), and another at the focal point of the dendron [64].\nOur group reported the synthesis of a series of amphiphilic LDBCs by coupling end‐functionalized alkyne PEGs to 2,2‐bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid (bis‐ MPA) dendrons of different generations. The dendrons were decorated with 4‐ cyanoazobenzene moieties at their periphery and an azide group at their focal point (see Figure 13.6). The amphiphilic LDBCs undergo self‐assembly in aque ous solution and micellar structures of different morphologies were obtained. These include nanofibers, sheet‐like micelles, and vesicles. It was shown that the self‐assembly behavior of the BCs was dictated, in part, by the hydrophobic/ hydrophilic balance (associated with the length of the PEG block and the genera tion number of the dendron) of the polymer. Light‐induced breakup of the vesi cles was only observed under somewhat high intensity light irradiation conditions [65]. The morphology and photoresponse of the self‐assemblies were later theo retically studied by Lin et al. using dissipative particle dynamics [66]. The authors concluded that the photoisomerization of azobenzenes arranged in the membrane\nof the LDBC vesicles should lead to distortion and eventually the rupture of the membrane consequently increasing the permeation of the nanocapsules.\nThe theoretical studies of Lin et al. (vide supra) prompted the design of a new series of LDBCs based on 4‐alkoxyazobenzene peripheral moieties, which leads to a less intense packing of chromophores in the inner part of the membrane and  a higher modification of polarity by photoisomerization with respect to 4‐cyanoazobenzene analogues. The derived vesicles were then easily stimulated (λ = 365 nm, at 2.6 mW cm−2) and their application as light‐responsive nanocar riers was evaluated using both hydrophobic and hydrophilic fluorescent probes [67]. Furthermore, changes induced by light to the polymeric vesicles were mod ulated by tuning the functionalization of the periphery. For example, in one series of materials the decoration of the periphery of the dendron was achieved by using a combination of azobenzene moieties and linear aliphatic chains, toward tuning the membrane stability and the payload‐release capabilities of the self‐assemblies. In particular, vesicles with a content of around 50% of azoben zene peripheral units exhibited significant morphological changes when they were exposed to light and an almost immediate release of their cargo [68].\nGarcía‐Juan et al. described the preparation of dual responsive LDBCs com bining thermo‐ and light‐response. A thermoresponsive copolymethacrylate of\n42513.3 Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies for Encapsulation and Release\ndiethylene and oligoethyleneglycol was coupled to a bis‐MPA dendron contain ing 50% of 4‐alkoxyazobenzene moieties and aliphatic tails. The LDBC self‐ assembled into vesicles were able to encapsulate and release either hydrophobic or hydrophilic payloads under thermal or light stimulation [69]. Recently, Kalva and Ambade described a series of LDBCs equipped with an azobenzene moiety linking the two blocks of the BC. No light‐triggered cargo‐release properties were observed, as the changes before and after irradiation were too subtle to induce the disassembly of the micelle [70]. Nevertheless, the replacement of the azobenzene moiety with an o‐nitrobenzyl linker enabled the preparation of nanocarriers that were capable of encapsulating and releasing cargo in response to pH changes [71]. Although most of the reported examples of photoresponsive LDBCs contain azobenzenes moieties, Goodwin et al. described the preparation of micellar systems based on a PEG‐dendron BC (as in Figure  13.6) having peripheral DNQ moieties. The photoresponse of the DNQ moieties (vide supra) was associated with the release of hydrophobic payloads including fluorescent probes. Furthermore, these systems exhibited low cytotoxicity when compared with linear analogues [72, 73]. Sun et  al. described a PEG‐poly(amidoamine) LDBC having DNQ peripheral moieties. The authors described the cell inter nalization process of the LDBC micelles carrying encapsulated DOX. Triggered DOX release and cytotoxicity under NIR light irradiation using HeLa cells was demonstrated [74]. The regular branched structure of dendrons was also exploited by Sun et  al. to prepare two‐photon‐sensitive (808 nm) and sugar‐ targeting nanocarriers from a poly(amidoamine) dendron having DNQ‐ended linear oligo(ε‐caprolactone) peripheral groups and a hydrophilic sugar moiety at the focal point. Light‐triggered release of encapsulated DOX and specific bind ing with lectins were demonstrated [75]. They also extended this approach to the preparation of photoresponsive nanocarriers based on Janus codendrimers dec orated with DNQ (hydrophobic dendron block) and lactose moieties (hydro philic dendron block) [76]. Sugar‐coated micelles prepared from these codendrimers showed binding with RCA120 lectin and the DOX encapsulated micelles exhibited a NIR‐triggered drug release and cytotoxicity similar to free DOX. Namezi and Gillies also demonstrated the UV‐triggered release of hydro phobic and hydrophilic payloads on Janus amphiphiles having a branched block with PEG linear chains combined with a photodegradable bis(MPA) dendron containing o‐nitrobenzyl esters [77].\nPolydispersed hyperbranched polymers share several of the advantageous properties of monodispersed dendrimers but their preparation is significantly less demanding, which has certainly incentivized research in this type of materi als [78]. Hyperbranched polymers can function as unimolecular micelles (vide infra) but also via multimolecular self‐assemblies as amphiphilic BCs [79, 80]. Photocontrolled response can easily be achieved through the appropriate modi fication of end groups. Accordingly, amphiphilic systems were prepared by grafting either DNQ or spiropyran light‐sensitive motifs to the peripheral groups of a polyphosphate‐based hyperbranched polymer. Encap sulation and light‐triggered release were verified using hydrophobic Nile Red and coumarin 102 models [81, 82]. Alternative, hyperbranched polyglycerols with a spiropyran moiety at the focal point also form biocompatible micelles, which under UV\n426 13 Light‐Controlled Encapsulation and Release Enabled by Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies\nillumination were able to release pyrene [83]. Mo et al. prepared hybrid struc tures consisting on hydrophilic hyperbranched poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate) with polycaprolactone linear arms grafted at photocleav age o‐nitrobenzyl branching points. Light‐induced degradation of the polymer hybrid was accompanied by the release of Nile Red from aqueous self‐assem blies [84].\nRecent advances in polymer chemistry based on combining controlled polymerization methods with click chemistries have opened endless possibili ties to design sophisticated polymers with precisely controlled architectures and tailored functionalities. Thus, BCs have been complemented by new amphiphilic polymer architectures, including star branched polymers. These contain three or more polymer chains emanating from a central core and their globular shape, with multiple chain ends, is attractive for drug delivery applica tions although applicability has been scarcely evaluated in vivo [85–88]. Depending on the length of the arms, star polymers may be seen as unimolecu lar containers or, more frequently, via self‐assembly, as amphiphilic BCs with low micellar concentrations and small morphological changes. Amongst them, miktoarm polymers are asymmetric star polymers including two or more types of arms species with different chemical composition and/or molecular weights. This heteroarm segmented architecture constitutes an excellent platform to combine hydrophobic, hydrophilic and light‐responsive linear blocks for the development of novel polymeric nanocarriers. Several examples of photore sponsive miktoarm azobenzene based polymers have been reported to date, and encapsulation and release of payloads from these systems have been dem onstrated. Amphiphilic photoresponsive miktoarm polymers of A3B type were described by Blasco et  al. consisting of three hydrophilic PEG arms and one azobenzene polymethacrylate arm (Figure  13.7). Polymer with adjusted arm lengths formed vesicles with encapsulating and UV‐triggered releasing proper ties for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic fluorescent probes [89]. Replacing PEG arms by temperature‐sensitive poly(N,N‐diethylacrylamide) ones, dual thermo‐ and photoresponsive micelles were produced where only photoi somerization of azobenzene stimulated the release of encapsulated Nile Red [90]. ABC miktoarm micelles with dual thermo‐ and photoresponse due to the\n42713.3 Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies for Encapsulation and Release\ncombination of PEG, poly(N‐isopropylacrylamide) and poly(o‐nitrobenzy lacrylate) where used to encapsulate Nile Red. Cargo molecules were released rapidly upon UV light irradiation [91]."

      "heading" : "13.3.3 Polymer Self‐Assemblies from Supramolecular BCs",
      "text" : "During last decades, the principles of supramolecular chemistry have been progressively combined with polymer chemistry broadening the scope for new chemically diverse polymers with controlled architectures. Following a “supra molecular synthetic approach,” which in many instances exhibits key features to achieve versatility, can expedite the discovery of novel macromolecular architec tures. Indeed, amphiphilic supramolecular di‐ or tri‐block copolymers can be readily assembled by connecting individual blocks through specific noncovalent interactions (end‐to‐end connection, for example), combining the reversibility and tunability of supramolecular materials with the intrinsic properties of poly mer chains [92]. Indeed, the incorporation of the adequate functionality either at the focal point or at some middle point of one of the individual blocks will result in systems with light responsive properties [93]. For these purposes, a wide vari ety of supramolecular interactions have been developed, which include host– guest interactions, hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking, and electrostatic pairing. The choice of supramolecular binding motif is conditioned by the stability of the noncovalent interaction in aqueous media, which is key requisite if applications in aqueous media are pursued [94]. In spite of this, only a limited number of studies have reported supramolecular micelles with encapsulating and light‐trig gered cargo‐release properties.\nRegarding host–guest systems, cyclodextrins (CDs) have been widely used as host molecules due to their wide availability and low toxicity. They are macrocy clic oligosaccharides with a toroidal molecular shape consisting of a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic internal cavity that can form inclusion complexes with different guest molecules in aqueous media [95]. The molecular recogni tion between CDs and azobenzenes has been employed for the construction of photoresponsive amphiphilic BC self‐assemblies. A CD‐azobenzene host–guest complex can serve as a linker to connect two segments, one hydrophobic and one hydrophilic, of a BC [96]. In the vast majority of CD systems, the trans‐ azobenzene is capable of forming stable host–guest complexes, while the cis‐ azobenzene is too bulky and does not fit inside the hydrophobic cavity of CDs. Thus, the reversible coupling of individual segments of a BC can be easily regu lated by alternating UV and visible light irradiation. The preparation of amphi philic linear– linear BCs has been realized by combining azobenzene and α‐CD terminated polymer chains (hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) and hydrophobic poly(caprolactone)) as described by Yan et al. [97]. In water, this supramolecular copolymer forms tubular structures that exhibit reversible assembly properties on account of the light‐controlled host‐guest “bond,” which connects the two blocks. The photoregulated assembly/disassembly properties imparted con trolled delivery capabilities to the micellar system. Other alternative amphiphilic macromolecular species based on the host–guest recognition properties of azobenzenes and CDs include amphiphilic LDBCs [98, 99] linear‐star [100],\n428 13 Light‐Controlled Encapsulation and Release Enabled by Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies\nmultiarm dendrimers [101], Janus hyperbranched [102], and hyperbranched– linear‐hyperbranched polymers [103]. Although the self‐assembling properties of these systems and their morphological transformations in response to light have been investigated in depth, clear evidence of light‐controlled cargo‐release properties are limited. Yao et al. have reported the preparation of a series of mik toarm AB2 supramolecular polymers consisting of PEG and poly(N‐ isopropylacrylamide) branches; with either one or two azobenzene‐CD host–guest complexes serving as linking motifs [104]. The miktoarm polymer undergoes micellization in aqueous media and the resulting micelles exhibit dual thermo‐ and light‐responsive properties and enable the controlled delivery of DOX.\nCDs have also been used to “mask” specific hydrophobic residues of polymer chains, which can alter the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of a system in a reversible fashion. Jin et al. have described the preparation of an azobenzene BC consisting of a PEG hydrophilic block and a hydrophobic poly(meth)acrylate car rying side‐chain azobenzene moieties (6 in Figure 13.8) [105]. Such a polymer undergoes micellization in aqueous media on account of the amphiphilic nature of the polymer, which results in the formation of stable vesicles. In the presence of CD the vesicles are disassembled as the macrocycle binds to the trans‐azobenzene moieties rendering the BC more hydrophilic. Upon exposure to UV light, the host–guest complexes fall apart and “unmask” the relatively hydrophobic azobenzene residues of the BC (Figure 13.8). This process partially restores the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the system and the vesicles regenerate. Wang et al. followed an analogous strategy by using a double hydrophobic copol ymer [106]. In this case, the micelles were formed in the presence of β‐CD and dissociated upon exposure to UV light. The authors demonstrated reversible self‐assembly by alternating UV and visible light although no encapsulation capabilities were reported.\nSupramolecular BCs based on specific hydrogen‐bonding pairs linking two or more blocks have been investigated in the past by using, typically, apolar organic\nsolvents [53]. Some of these systems can also undergo aqueous self‐assembly forming micelles and vesicles, which are pH‐responsive; although no drug‐ delivery light‐responsive systems have been reported to date. Light‐sensitive moieties may be readily attached to a polymer chain via noncovalent side‐chain functionalization reactions [107]. In one case, light‐sensitive nanospheres were produced by combining a poly(4‐vinylpyridine) polymer chain with a low molec ular weight carboxylic acid terminated azobenzene via hydrogen‐bonding inter actions [108, 109]. Multiple‐point hydrogen bonding motifs can establish much stronger interactions than single‐point hydrogen bonding motifs such as that of pyridine‐carboxylic acid, which are significantly weakened in aqueous media. In this regard, Concellón et al. used a 2,6‐diacylaminopyridine, a nucleobase ana logue, to impart light responsiveness to an amphiphilic BC (7 in Figure 13.9). The BC was composed of a PEG block and a polymethacrylate block with pendant 2,6‐diacylaminopyridine moieties, which were functionalized with thymine‐ terminated azobenzene moieties, via three‐point hydrogen bonding interactions. Depending on the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the BC, micelles and vesi cles were obtained in aqueous media. Encapsulation and light‐triggered cargo‐ release of model compounds were also demonstrated [110]."

      "text" : "In the previous sections, we have covered ways of producing polymeric encapsu lants (micelles and vesicles) from amphiphilic BCs. Alternatively, non‐ amphiphilic structures can also be assembled into colloidal capsules (a compartmentalized pod with a polymer membrane), through appropriate manufacturing methods. In  contrast to polymer vesicles (vide supra), which generally exhibit a bilayer\n430 13 Light‐Controlled Encapsulation and Release Enabled by Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies\nmembrane formed by amphiphilic macromolecular species, capsules of a much wider range of materials can be fabricated.\nThe production of large millimeter‐size capsules is most frequently achieved through injection molding, which is a well‐established low‐cost technology [111]. Smaller microcapsules, with diameters ranging from tens of nanometers up to a few hundred microns, are prepared by several methods including pan spray drying, pan coating, centrifugal extrusion, emulsion‐based methods, distil lation–precipitation polymerization, template‐based polymerization, and layer‐ by‐layer approaches [112]. In general, each method has advantages for specific applications, which depend on a variety of characteristics of a capsule including size, shape, shell wall thickness, permeability, and composition and mechanical stability of the shell wall. A number of review articles and books have been focused on the preparation of polymeric capsules, including light‐responsive systems [113–116]. Here, we present a few selected examples of photoresponsive capsules, for their preparation and mechanisms of actuation.\nLight‐responsive capsule formation has been achieved by the electrostatic rec ognition of two oppositely charged polymers at the liquid–liquid interface in an emulsified system, or through the use of layer‐by‐layer methodologies. These capsules typically present a thin wall and are thus rather fragile. The stability of the shell wall can be enhanced if the membrane is a covalently cross‐linked net work. Such covalent capsules can be produced, for example, by means of in situ polymerization. Here, the reactive monomers are dissolved in an aqueous phase that is mixed with an immiscible solvent and subsequently emulsified. After emulsification, the monomers are polymerized to create a covalently cross‐linked shell. Cao et  al. reported the synthesis of a photodegradable polymer capsule system through the one‐pot free radical polymerization of N‐ isopropylacrylamide, methacrylic acid, and the photolabile 5‐(methacryloyloxy)‐2‐nitrobenzyl meth acrylate on dimethyldiethoxysilane oil‐in‐water emulsion templates, followed by the removal of the sacrificial core [117]. Upon exposure to UV light, the capsules degraded due to the selective photocleavage of the o‐nitrobenzyl ester linkers in the shell wall. Photocontrolled release of coumarin 102, as a model hydrophobic cargo, was also demonstrated. Alternatively to the free radical polymerization of small monomers and cross‐linkers, photoreactive groups may be directly embed ded in the shell‐forming material via covalent functionalization of a preformed polymer [118]. This is a relatively straightforward approach that enables the preparation of robust systems with a higher level of control over material composition and, more importantly, well‐defined photoresponsive properties. Indeed, such a method has enabled the production of capsules composed of pol yorganosiloxane NPs carrying nitrocinnamate residues [119]. The capsules were assembled through a water/oil/water emulsification process followed by the photocrosslinking of the nitrocinnamate groups. It was shown that the capsule content (CD, as a model guest molecule) can be released upon light irradiation. Layer‐by‐layer approach is another method for capsule preparation, which typi cally involves the use of metal oxide or polymer particles as template, and poly electrolytes as shell‐forming materials [120–123]. Park et al. prepared a series of microcapsules by coating polystyrene particles with alternating layers of nega\n43113.3 Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies for Encapsulation and Release\ntively charged poly(sodium 4‐styrenesulfonate) and positively charged poly(allylamie hydrochloride) carrying benzophenone moieties [124, 125]. After the coating process, the polymer layers are held together by electrostatic interac tions and the polystyrene core particle was removed by means of selective sol vent extraction, leaving behind a hollow compartmentalized capsule. With the capsules in hand, the kinetics of release of encapsulated rhodamine B were meas ured before and after UV light irradiation, and the photocontrol over release rates (i.e. permeability of rhodamine B through the shell) was demonstrated. It is worth noting that the photocrosslinking of benzophenone is not used as a release trigger but rather as a way to tune the rate of release. Azobenzene switches have also been exploited for light‐controlled permeability purposes. Tao et al. showed that azobenzene moieties, when incorporated into the shell wall of polyelectro lyte layer‐by‐layer capsules, altered the permeability values of the encapsulant exposed to light [126, 127]. In a recent study, Yi and Sukhorukov developed a layer‐by‐layer capsule system by sequential deposition of two polyelectrolytes, i.e. negatively charged azopolymer and positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), on silicon dioxide microparticles [128]. Upon light exposure, the multilayer shell of these capsules underwent a structural reorganization driven by the preferential formation of azobenzene J aggregates. Such process, which is accompanied by the disruption of the cap sule wall, was shown to control the release of encapsulated bovine serum albu min. Bédard et al. reported the incorporation of meso‐tetrakis(4‐sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin into the shell wall of layer‐by‐layer capsules [129]. The capsules were disrupted by means of laser light irradiation (λ = 532 nm, at 70 mW cm−2) in the presence of an oxidizing agent, such as H2O2. Under these conditions, it has been suggested that the porphyrin residues have the capacity to generate reactive oxy gen species (ROS) in a process that disturbs the electrostatic interactions between the polymers holding the shell together and increases the permeability of the cap sule [130]. Photoreactive triphenylmethane leucohydroxide (TPML) is another photoreactive group that has been incorporated into the shell wall material of polyelectrolyte complex capsules [131]. In this case, the release rate of p‐toluene sulfonate from layer‐by‐layer capsules increased under UV light irradiation, a phenomenon which was associated with the photoinduced dissociation of the TPML residues. There exist other approaches to exert controlled release includ ing light‐induced changes of ionic strength [132], and the use of specific host– guest interactions [133], diazonium compounds [134], o‐nitrobenzyl derivatives [135], and coumarin‐functionalized polymers [136].\nIn recent years, the area of light‐regulated substance‐release has witnessed several transformational advances including the use of flow focusing devices for the preparation of hierarchically structured capsules (vide infra) and the devel opment of novel photocontrolled cascade chemical reactions. Gu et  al. have developed a system in which a protein, caspase‐3 in this case, was encapsulated in an enzymaticallydegradable polymeric capsule incorporating peptidic cross‐ linkers [137]. The light‐controlled substance‐release capabilities were associated with specific residues of the cross‐linkers. These residues were caged by photo labile groups, a feature that inhibited the polymer shell from degradation by the\ncaspase‐3 from within. The utility and robustness of the system was demon strated through the UV light controlled cytoplasmic delivery of caspase‐3 to HeLa cells. Another sophisticated approach has been demonstrated by the Herrmann laboratory where the encapsulation of photolabile 2‐oxoacetates derivatives in core–shell capsules allowed the light‐induced release of fragrances (Figure 13.10) [138]. On exposure to UV light (λ = 340–380 nm, at 3.1 mW cm−2) the encapsulated 2‐oxoacetates derivatives degraded to form the fragrances 2‐phenylacetaldehyde and (E)‐4‐(2,6,6‐trimethylcyclohex‐2‐en‐1‐yl)but‐3‐en‐2‐ one; and the gases CO and CO2 at rates that were sufficiently high to induce the breakup of the capsule.\nFinally, the use of flow focusing devices for the preparation of core–shell microcapsules have allowed for a variety of liquids and actives to be encapsu lated, which were incompatible with other emulsification techniques [139]. Also, capsules with multiple release triggers, including light, can be produced in a straightforward manner [140–142]. This approach was followed by the Abell and Scherman laboratories where hydrogel microcapsules were produced by com bining, in the presence of the host molecule cucurbit[8]uril, a guest polymer anthracene‐functionalized hydroxyethyl cellulose, and a fluorinated surfactant [143]. The electrostatic attraction between the charged polymer and the sur factant enabled the formation of a supramolecular hydrogel capsule shell in a single emulsion. Additionally, stimuli‐responsive controlled molecular permea bility was possible on account of the dynamic nature of the interactions holding the hydrogel shell together, which could be selectively transformed into irrevers ible covalent interactions (photochemically dimerized anthracene residues) by UV light irradiation. In summary, significant progress has been made toward understanding the mechanisms underlying the formation of polymer capsules, and this insight is being translated to the modulation of controlled‐release, which shows great promise for the future applicability of this field.\n43313.3 Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies for Encapsulation and Release"

      "heading" : "13.3.5 Photoresponsive Microgels and Nanogels",
      "text" : "Microgels and nanogels are swollen cross‐linked polymeric particles that show a unique series of features. They exhibit a combination of the characteristics of colloidal particles (colloidal stability, high surface area, and control over parti cle size) with those associated with macroscopic hydrogels (three‐dimensional branched configuration, structural integrity, and fluid‐like transport proper ties) [144]. Although no clear connection between nomenclature (micro versus nano) and particle size has been established yet (the terms microgels and nano gels are often used interchangeably), particles with a size in the 20–200 nm are typically referred as nanogels. Regarding the preparation of microgels and nanogels, it is possible to distinguish between two main categories depending on whether the gel beads are produced in a single‐phase or multiphase hetero geneous systems (e.g. precipitation polymerization or microemulsion). The production method of choice is dictated by the potential application of the final system, which in many occasions is related to the controlled loading and release of compounds. Light‐controlled release has been proposed in the context of microgels and nanogels [145], and some representative examples are high lighted here. The photoinduced response of microgels and nanogels is predom inantly associated with irreversible transformations. Only a few examples of reversible reactions have been reported to date [146, 147]. Irreversible photoin duced degradation of nanogels has been achieved by exploiting the chemistry of o‐nitrobenzyl [148–150], and 7‐amino coumarin derivatives [151]. Nevertheless, only a few selected studies have demonstrated systems with substance‐release capabilities. Klinger and Landfester have reported the preparation of poly(2‐ hydroxyethyl methacrylate‐co‐ methacrylic acid) microgels with o‐nitrobenzyl‐ type photolabile linkers moieties [152]. The gel beads were successfully loaded with myoglobin, in a process assisted by the establishment of electrostatic interactions between the positively charged protein and the negatively charged polymer. In addition to the pH‐controlled properties of the system (associated with the carboxylic acid residues of the polymer network), light‐induced (UV light in the range of λ = 315–390 nm, at 17–60 mW cm−2) network degradation accompanied by substance‐release was demonstrated by inducing the photol ytic cleavage of the o‐nitrobenzyl cross‐linkers. A similar approach was fol lowed by Azagarsamy et al. for the encapsulation of photocontrolled (λ = 365 nm light, at 10 mW cm−2) release of alkaline phosphatase (as a model protein) from nanogels labeled with cell‐penetrating peptides [153]. These studies clearly demonstrated that biocompatible nanogels are capable of encapsulating pro teins, maintaining their activity and releasing proteins in response to light. The chemistry of o‐nitrobenzyl linkages has also been combined with orthogonal triggers, and nanogels which respond to temperature, pH, and UV light have recently been developed [154].\nZan et  al. have reported the introduction of NIR light dyes into polymeric nanogels, which exhibit controlled‐release based on the photothermal effect [155]. In this case, the nanogels were composed of two complementary poly mers: a side‐chain hydrophilic random terpolymer carrying adamantine residues and a β‐CD‐functionalized poly(amidoamine) dendrimer. The assembly of\n434 13 Light‐Controlled Encapsulation and Release Enabled by Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies\nthe polymers into nanogels relied on the formation of host–guest interactions between the adamantine and the CD residues. The encapsulation of substances in these systems, which is concomitant to the nanogel formation, can happen directly in aqueous media. The simultaneous loading of indocyanine green (an NIR dye in tumor‐specific imaging [156], and photothermal applications) and the chemotherapy drug DOX were the basis to demonstrate the triggered DOX‐ release capabilities (via photothermal effect and host–guest complex dissocia tion) under NIR light irradiation (λ = 805 nm, at 1.5 W cm−2). Khatun et al. have developed an alternative system based also on the photothermal effect [157]. In this study, DOX‐functionalized graphene was embedded in a polymeric nanogel composed of disulfide‐cross‐linked hyaluronic acid. It was shown that the pho tothermal effect associated with the graphene enhanced the release of DOX from the nanogel at pH = 5.0–7.4 upon NIR light (λ = 670 nm, at 1.0 W cm−2) irradia tion. Additionally, combined thermo‐chemotherapy was investigated both in vitro and in vivo, and the controlled generation of heat leading to photoabla tion of cancer cells was demonstrated."

      "text" : "In addition to the classical families of soft polymer encapsulants (capsules, BC micelles, nanogels, and microgels) reviewed in Sections 13.3.1–13.3.5, there exists a large miscellaneous collection of compartmentalized polymeric species that have been explored in the context of light‐controlled substance‐release [13, 158, 159]. These include core‐cross‐linked NPs, knedel‐like shell‐crosslinked NPs, uncrosslinked homopolymer‐based NPs, multiparticle crosslinked species and unimolecular systems, to name just a few. Given the wide variety of NP struc tures and compositions, rather than being exhaustive, we present some selected examples of a few recent and well‐referenced studies and associate them with mechanisms of actuation.\nLight‐sensitive degradable polymers that can be triggered to degrade through multiple light‐sensitive groups along the polymer backbone have been broadly explored in NP formulation (see Figure 13.11). Pioneering work by the Almutairi laboratory was based on self‐immolative quinone‐methidine system 10 (Figure 13.11) [24]. The release of Nile Red, as a model cargo, from particles based on polymer 10 was observed upon light exposure (λ = 750 nm with ~100 fs pulse widths and 80 MHz repetition rate, at c. 2.6 W). Control experiments showed that no release occurs when the particles are protected from light expo sure or when the dye is encapsulated in poly(lactic‐co‐glycolic acid). Of those systems developed at the Almutairi laboratory [24, 25, 159–161], it is also worth highlighting 12 (Figure 13.11), which is a random terpolymer with sensitivity toward both UV–vis (λ  =  320–480 nm, at c. 100 mW cm−2) and NIR light (λ  =  800 nm, at c. 82.7 W cm−2), via two‐photon absorption [161]. NPs of 12 encapsulating Nile Red were successfully produced by an emulsification pro cess, and the fluorescence of the encapsulated Nile Red was monitored upon exposure to light. Fast and complete fluorescence quenching was observed when UV–vis light was employed, a phenomenon which was associated with\nthe  efficient degradation of the particles and release of the payload. The same effect was achieved with NIR light, at the expense of prolonging the irradiation time. Lv et  al. have evaluated the cargo‐release capabilities of polymeric NPs based on photodegradable polyurethane 13 (Figure 13.11) [162]. Additionally, light‐triggered (λ = 365 nm, at 11 mW cm−2) burst release of fluorescein diacetate and Tagalsin G in cells was also demonstrated. While the majority of light‐ triggerable polymeric NPs systems rely on the chemistry of o‐nitrobenzyl esters and their analogues, an alternative system based on benzoin derivatives has recently been reported by Englert et al. [163] (14 in Figure 13.11). Traditionally used as protecting groups [164], benzoins undergo a photochemical rearrange ment to yield 2‐phenylbenzofurans and, in polyester 14, serve as photolabile repeating units. Englert et al. formulated 14 as NPs and, as a proof‐of‐concept, the encapsulation and photoinduced release of Nile Red from the particles was demonstrated. It was shown that exposure times as short as 10 seconds were suf ficient to induce significant release. An additional system has been designed at the Liu laboratory, where photoactive polymer NPs were designed as gene deliv ery vectors [165]. In this case, nucleic acids (and, potentially, therapeutic DNA) can interact electrostatically the photoresponsive polymer in a process that results in the formation of stable NPs in aqueous media. As the polymer carries both photosensitizer moieties, which are capable of generating ROS upon light irradiation, and ROS‐sensitive linkers, the NPs degrade when exposed to light (white light, at 50 mW cm−2) and release the DNA cargo. Lin et al. have recently reported the development of hypoxia‐activated photoresponsive drug‐release system based on a nitroimidazole‐locked coumarin phototrigger [166]. In essence, the drug, etoposide, in this case, was locked by the phototrigger (cou marin), which was again locked by the hypoxia regulator (nitroimidazole resi due); and where the whole system was conceived as a cleavable linker between the drug and the polymer NP. In aerobic environments the nitroimidazole relaxes the photoexcited coumarin and effectively avoids any photoinduced\n436 13 Light‐Controlled Encapsulation and Release Enabled by Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies\nbond cleavage. However, under hypoxic conditions (such as those found in solid tumors), the nitroimidazole residue is reduced to aminoimidazole, which allows the bond cleavage to take place. It is worth highlighting that the drug is not only physically entrapped in the NP (as in the vast majority of previous examples), but also covalently bound to the polymer carrier and the release of the drug is achieved by selectively cleaving the linker between the active and the encapsu lant via light irradiation.\nPhotoresponsive cinnamic acid residues have been proposed as stimuli‐ responsive cross‐linkers to control the stability and morphology of polymeric NPs. Shi et al. reported that the photoinduced [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of trans‐cinnamic acids, which is associated to reversible changes of NP size, could control cargo‐release too [167]. Tan et al. have recently reported the preparation of porous crosslinked polymeric NPs through a continuous assembly of poly mers strategy [168]. In this study, polymeric macromonomers carrying azoben zene, α‐CD and norbornene groups were embedded into mesoporous silica templates; and subsequently crosslinked by ring‐opening methathesis polymeri zation (irreversible bonds) and CD‐azobenzene host–guest inclusion complex formation (reversible bonds). The etching of the silica templates resulted in porous polymeric NP incorporating reversible crosslinkers, which displayed light‐induced burst‐release capabilities. UV light (λ  =  365 nm) was shown to induce burst release of encapsulated dextran, with c. 50% releases with one sec ond of irradiation. An alternative way of inducing cargo‐release from polymeric NPs is related to a specific photocontrolled switch of the hydrophobic/hydro philic balance of NP. Cui et  al. have prepared polymeric chitosan particles by mixing chitosan hydrochloride and 4‐oxo‐4‐(pyren‐4‐ylmethoxy) butanoic acid, which are capable of interacting through ionic pairing [169]. The attachment of the hydrophobic pyrene residues to chitosan yields a complex with a relatively high hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, which self‐collapse in the form of NPs. Such species are sensitive to light irradiation on account of the photolabile pyr ene residues. Using Nile Red as a model cargo substance, the controlled‐release capabilities of the NPs were investigated by using UV (λ  =  365 nm, in power range of 50–1200 mW cm−2) and NIR (λ = 808 nm, at 140 mW cm−2). A similar strategy has been followed for the development of swellable NP exhibiting light‐ triggered release capabilities [170, 171].\nIn the past decade, a significant focus has been placed on unimolecular micelles, which comprise a distinct class of encapsulants. Contrary to cross‐ linked core–shell particles, unimolecular micelles exhibit a distinct core and shell that are covalently bound together [172, 173]. This feature, in the context of encapsulation, provides some potential advantages over multimolecular and crosslinked systems. Unimolecular micelles possess a well‐defined structure and are, therefore, monodisperse. Additionally, they provide many possibilities for specific functionalization to adapt to specific applications. In spite of the recent progress that has been made in the development of unimolecular micelles [174– 176] light‐responsive unimolecular encapsulants remain relatively unexplored. The inclusion of substances within photoresponsive single‐molecule dendritic structures has been reported in the past [177, 178], but no cargo‐release capabili ties were reported. Allcock and coworkers described the synthesis of unimolecular\n43713.4 Conclusions\nmultiarm star amphiphilic BCs of the type star‐poly(methyl methacrylate)‐ poly(ethylene glycol)methyl ether methacrylate) [179]. These polymers were grown from a multivalent initiator with photolabile o‐nitrobenzyl linkers, follow ing an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) procedure. The study showed that the polymers have the ability to undergo self‐collapse in aqueous media producing unimolecular micelles, which subsequently self‐assemble into large micellar species. The stability of the polymer micelles decreased signifi cantly after UV light irradiation (as shown by the increased critical aggregation concentration values), a phenomenon which was associated to the dissociation of the arms of the polymers from the core. The encapsulation and photoinduced‐ release of pyrene from the star BC micelles were studied in order to demonstrate the potential of the system. Johnson et al. have reported the loading of unimo lecular polymer brushes with drugs such as DOX and camptothecin [180, 181]. The actives were attached to the polymers via photocleavable nitrobenzyloxyl carbonyl linkers. The release of the drugs could be controlled by exposure to UV light. For instance, DOX and camptothecin‐loaded polymer brushes exhibited significantly higher toxicity levels to human cancer cells after photoinduced drug release. Despite these examples, light‐induced release from unimolecular poly meric carriers remains largely unexplored. We believe there are excellent oppor tunities in this area by combining, in a single species, macromolecular building blocks imparting both water‐solubility and high‐loading capacities, with light‐ responsive host–guest complexes [182, 183], which may provide protection to actives and triggered substance‐release capabilities."

      "text" : "Light is a convenient “tool” for the isomerization of specific functional groups and the formation and cleavage of covalent bonds and supramolecular interac tions. In addition, it is orthogonal to other reaction conditions and may be applied in a remote fashion, which makes it an attractive trigger for the design of photoresponsive encapsulants, including polymeric vesicles, NPs, and nanogels. The light‐triggered release of actives from polymer carriers can be based, for example, on the photochemical decomposition of a capsule wall containing pho tolabile moieties (o‐nitrobenzyl derivatives), or on photoisomerizable moieties (such as spiropyrans or azobenzenes). A considerable amount of work has been done in the area of light‐responsive polymeric encapsulants, which has been complemented by the advent of powerful polymerization (ATRP, for example) and polymer derivatization techniques (i.e. Huisgen 1,3‐dipolar cycloaddition and thiol‐ene Michael addition). While the vast majority of systems are respon sive to UV light, the latest developments pursue actuation at increasingly longer wavelengths. This trend is driven by the shortcomings exhibited by UV light in the context of biologically relevant applications (limited tissue penetration and potential tissue damage associated with high energy inputs). There is currently a substantial interest to develop red‐shifted chromophores, which could be exploited by combining them with biocompatible polymers; and design visible and NIR‐light‐controlled encapsulants. Other relevant systems are based on\n438 13 Light‐Controlled Encapsulation and Release Enabled by Photoresponsive Polymer Self‐Assemblies\ntwo‐photon excitation methodologies and photothermal effects. Although these techniques have not been discussed here in great detail, the increased pace of research activity is apparent and many exciting developments are expected in this area."

      "text" : "Proton transfer is one of the most fundamental processes in nature and numerous chemical, material, and biological processes are driven by proton transfer. For example, biological systems use proton gradient as an energy form to synthesize ATP for their biological functions; many organic reactions are catalyzed by Bronsted acids; and many materials have pH‐sensitive properties. Proton transfer is also involved in different aspects of polymer science relative to preparation, property, and processing. For example, cationic polymerizations can be initiated by proton transfer from a strong acid to a monomer. It has been reported that many polymers are sensitive to the pH (proton concentration) of the environment, and their properties including mechanical, geometrical, electric, optical, and magnetic properties, change with pH due to proton transfer between the polymers and the environment. Polymers with acid‐labile bonds have been studied for drug delivery; and photoinduced cationic polymerization using photoacid‐generators (PAGs) has been applied to photolithography.\nAn important research aims at using photoinduced proton transfer as a general mechanism to develop different types of photoresponsive polymers that reversibly alter their properties or release functional molecules upon irradiation. As described above, PAGs have been utilized to initiate cationic polymerization with great spatial control [1, 2]. Upon irradiation, these PAGs generate strong acids, which induce proton transfer and the consequent events. However, although some PAGs have reversible pathways in their mechanisms, they are generally irreversible. For the development of photoresponsive polymers, reversibility of the photoinduced property change is often required. It is desired that one can not only start (initiate) a process using light, but can also stop and/or reverse the process by turning off the light or applying a light with a different wavelength. The reversibility of the photoinduced property change implies a reversible proton transfer, which requires a reversible photoacid. The well‐ studied excited‐ state photoacids such as naphthol derivatives are reversible [3–5]. However, due\nPhotoresponsive Soft Materials Based on Reversible Proton Transfer"

This type of photoacid possesses a high‐acidic metastable state generated from a reversible photoreaction. Examples of the photoacids as well as their photoreactions are shown in Figure 14.1. The lifetime of the high‐acidic metastable state is long enough for accumulating a large proton concentration. The photoacids revert to the low‐acidic ground state and take back the protons once the irradiation is removed. The reversibility differentiates this type of photoacid from PAG, and the large photoinduced proton concentration differentiates it from the excited‐state photoacid.\nMost of the proton transfer processes are driven by a high proton concentration. The lifetime of the photo‐generated acidic state that is needed to generate a practically useful proton concentration can be estimated by a simple model. A sample containing a photoacid is irradiated by a light beam with a photon flux of q. The irradiation area is S and the depth of the sample is L. The fraction of the photon absorbed is f and the quantum yield is ɸ. Under irradiation, the photoacid changes from its ground state G to the acidic state A. At the stationary state, the photoreaction rate is the same as the reverse reaction rate.\nR Rf r= (14.1)\nAssuming that the reverse reaction is a first order reaction with a rate constant of k, we can obtain the Eq. (14.2)\nfq L k/ A= [ ] (14.2) Since the half‐life of the acidic state τ = ln 2/k, Eq. (14.2) can be transformed to\nEq. (14.3).\n45114.2 Photoactivity and Physicochemical Properties of Metastable‐State Photoacids in Polymer Films\nA[ ] = ⋅( )fq L/ ln2 (14.3) Assuming that q = 1 mmol m−2 s−1 (which is about the intensity of a strong LED or sunlight), f = 1, ɸ = 1, and L = 1 μm (which is the typical dimension for a thin film material or a cell), to obtain 1 mM of the acidic state A or higher, the half‐life must be longer than 0.7 ms. In real conditions, f is often much smaller than 1. So even when a stronger light source is used and a concentration less than 1 mM is required, millisecond is still a reasonable estimate for the lower limit of the half‐ life. For metastable‐state photoacids, the half‐lives are often much longer than milliseconds. Therefore, they can generate a large proton concentration under moderate irradiation.\nSince our report of the first metastable‐state photoacid (mPAH) in 2011, photo‐induced proton transfer using this type of photoacid has become a popular approach for the development of various photo‐controlled systems. Applications in energy conversion [9, 10], sensor [11, 12], polymerization [13], micro‐patterning [14, 15], nanomaterial [15–17], molecular machine [18], photochromic material [19–22], and biomedical [23, 24] areas have been reported by our group and other researchers. Regarding photoresponsive polymers, our group previously showed that a hydrogel of poly(acrylamide‐co‐acrylic acid) significantly reduced its volume under irradiation in the presence of a mPAH [6]. Protonation of the carboxylic anions by the photoacid decreased the hydrophilicity of the polymer and diminished the repulsion between carboxylic anions, which consequently lowered the water content in the hydrogel and reduced its volume. The Chumbimuni‐Torres’ group developed an ion‐selective membrane sensor consisting of mPAHs and a calcium ionophore in a plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) [11, 12]. Upon irradiation, the protons of the photoacids in the membrane diffused into the solution. Cations in the solution penetrated into the membrane to balance the charge and thus were detected by the ionophore. The sensor could be repeatedly used due to the reversibility of the photoacids.\nIn this chapter, the physicochemical properties of mPAHs in polymer matrix are described first, then three photoresponsive materials recently developed by our group will be presented. The photochromic materials are based on optical property change upon protonation; the fragrant‐releasing polymers described in the following section are based on acid‐catalyzed reaction; and the photo‐ controlled nanomaterials are based on noncovalent cross‐linking affected by protonation. These mechanisms together with the ion‐exchange mechanism mentioned above are commonly involved in the photoresponsive materials based on mPAHs."

      "text" : "Photoactivity and physicochemical properties of mPAHs in solutions have been studied before [25]. The mPAH 1 in Figure 14.1 is the most well studied mPAH. It has a protonated merocyanine (MEH) structure with an absorption maximum\n452 14 Photoresponsive Soft Materials Based on Reversible Proton Transfer\n(λmax) at 424 nm in water. Visible‐light irradiation induces a trans–cis isomerization to form cis‐MEH, which undergoes a nucleophilic reaction to form an acidic spiropyran (SPH) (Figure 14.1). The photoacidity is determined by the acidity of the SPH. The photoacidity of mPAH1 (pKa under irradiation) in methanol was determined to be 3.7 using methyl orange as an indicator, and in water it was estimated to be 3.2–1.7 [20]. The dark acidity (pKa in the dark) of mPAH1 was calculated to be 7.8 based on the pH of an aqueous solution [6]. However, the effective pKa, which includes the effect of the equilibrium between MEH and SPH, must be measured with pH buffers. Experiment showed that the effective dark pKa of mPAH1 is lower than 7.4 [8]. The quantum yield of the photoreaction in DMSO was measured to be as high as 0.37 [25].\nThe photoreaction is reversible and the metastable SP form reverts back to the MEH form after recombining with the proton it releases. The reverse reaction of mPAH1 in solutions is a second order reaction, which indicates that the rate‐ limiting step involves recombination of SP and proton [25]. The rate constants in water, ethanol, and DMSO are 73, 1.6, and 0.034 M−1 s−1, respectively. The trend can be better explained by the hydrogen‐bond donor acidity, which is related to the ability of the solvents to transfer the proton to SP. The reverse reactions of mPAH1 in organic solvent and polymers are slow. Several mPAHs with faster reverse reaction have been developed. For example, mPAH 2 (Figure 14.2) with a methoxy group on the phenolic moiety showed much faster reverse reaction rate than mPAH1 in solutions [26]. In this work, mPAH2 in polymer films was studied to understand the behaviors of metastable‐state photoacid in polymer matrix [27].\nThin films of mPAH2 were prepared by spin casting solutions of mPAH2 and poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) on glass substrates. PHEMA contains hydroxyl groups on flexible side chains, which mimic the environment of an alcohol and may assist proton transfer in the polymer. The weight ratio of the photoacid to PHEMA was 2.5%. After the solvent was completely removed by baking on a hot plate and then in vacuum, the films were very stable under ambient conditions and showed essentially the same photochemical properties after half a year. The photoreaction of mPAH2 in the polymer was monitored by UV– Vis spectroscopy. To monitor the UV–Vis absorption during the irradiation, polymer film on a glass substrate was kept at a tilted position, and the irradiation was perpendicular to the detecting beam. The light source was a 470 nm LED with a photon flux about 900 μmol m2 s−1 (23 mW cm−2). UV–Vis spectra were collected every six seconds during irradiation (Figure 14.2).\nThe MEH form of mPAH2 has an absorption maximum (λmax) at 466 nm in the polymer film. As shown in Figure 14.2, upon irradiation, absorbance of MEH rapidly decreased in the first six seconds. Then the reduction of the absorbance quickly slowed down. After two minutes, the absorbance was reduced to about 66% of the original level. Although the photoreaction is formally a unimolecular reaction, the data obtained here cannot be fit to a first order kinetic equation. The rate of the reverse reaction must be comparable to that of the photoreaction. The process is further complicated by the slow proton diffusion in the polymer. Proton diffuses much slower in a polymer than in a protic solution. Upon irradiation, a local concentration of proton was built up around the photoacids. Previous work showed that the rate‐limiting step of the reverse reaction is the recombina-\ntion of SP and H+ [25]. In polymer, the concentration of the photoacid is high. In fact, 2.5 wt% is equal to approximately 60 mM as compared to ~0.5 mM commonly used for solution study. A high concentration of the photoacid resulted in a high concentration of SP and H+ at the late stage of the photoreaction, which leads to a fast reverse reaction and slow overall reaction. In addition, the local concentration due to slow diffusion in polymer could be higher or lower than the average value, resulting in complicated kinetics.\nThe reverse reaction was studied by monitoring the recovery of the absorbance at 466 nm after irradiation. A rapid increase of the absorbance was observed within the first 20 minutes and the rate slowed down with time (Figure  14.3). Unlike the reverse reaction in solutions, the data could not be fitted into either a first order or a second order rate equation. We also tried to fit only the data in the first 20 minutes to first and second order rate equations and did not succeed. Figure 14.3 shows that, 59% of the MEH form recovered after 20 minutes, and it took 180 minutes for 90% recovery. UV irradiation (254 and 300 nm) did not increase the reverse reaction rate.\nThe reversibility of the photoacid in polymer film was tested by repeated exposure to 470 nm irradiation. For each cycle, the sample was irradiated for five minutes and then kept in the dark for 10 minutes. As shown in Figure 14.4, ~80% of the photoacid reacted after each irradiation, and ~30% recovered after 10 minutes due to the slow reverse reaction. After the tenth irradiation, the sample was kept in the dark for 24 hours, 95% of MEH recovered showing good\nphotostability. Slow proton diffusion in the polymer film is one of the major reasons for the slow reverse reactions. Recombination with proton is needed for the reverse reaction. Although the initial rate for the reverse reaction could be fast due to high local proton concentration, the overall rate is slow because the protons that have diffused in the polymer cannot move back fast.\nFor many applications related to photoswitching, a fast reverse process is required. In order to enhance the reverse reaction rate, ammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate (ATFMS) was introduced. ATFMS has been used as a cathode additive in fuel cell systems to improve the proton conductance [28]. Therefore, 5 wt% of ATFMS was added to a polymer film and the film was tested by 100 cycles of three‐minute irradiation and five minutes in the dark per cycle (Figure 14.5). About 60% recovery was observed in 5 minutes compared to ~30% recovery in 10 minutes for the films without ATFMS. After the film was tested for 50 cycles, it was kept in the dark overnight (~16 hours), at which point 92% of MEH was recovered. Then the next 50 cycles were performed. After 100 cycles, the sample was kept in the dark for 16 hours, and 90% of MEH recovered."

      "text" : "Protonation of a molecule can significantly alter its electronic structure and lead to changes in electronic and optical properties. Therefore, photoresponsive electronic and optical materials can be developed using metastable‐state photoacids [19–22, 29]. Photochromic materials that change their colors upon irradiation have been studied for decades. Prior photochromic materials are based on molecules that reversibly change their structures upon irradiation [30, 31]. Common photochromic molecules such as SPHs, diaryethenes, and azobenzenes have colorless or light colored forms that respond to UV light and change to colorful\n456 14 Photoresponsive Soft Materials Based on Reversible Proton Transfer\nforms [32–36]. Some molecules show negative photochromic property. They change from colorful forms to colorless forms under visible light [37–39]. Our group has developed a new type of photochromic material based on reversible proton transfer using metastable‐state photoacids.\nIn this work, photochromic materials were prepared by mixing mPAHs with acidochromic dyes in solutions, hydrogels, and polymers [19, 20]. Acidochromic dyes are the molecules that changes colors upon protonation. Under irradiation, the dye is protonated by the mPAH, and consequently changes its color. In the absence of the activating light, the photoacid returns to the low acidity state, takes back the proton from the dye, and the color changes back. Various color changes and the desirable stimulating wavelengths can be achieved by choosing different acidochromic dyes and photoacids.\nMPAH1 was mixed with the acidochromic dye AD1, which has a pKa of ~5 and changes from yellow to blue upon protonation (Figure 14.6). Blue and yellow are complementary colors, and have maximum color contrast. The photochromic behavior was first studied in solution. An ethanol solution of MPAH1 and AD1 quickly changed from yellow to blue upon irradiation (470 nm) in about two minutes. Before irradiation, UV–Vis spectrum showed a strong absorption at 440 nm, which is an overlap of the absorptions of both the mPAH and the dye. After irradiation, this absorption decreased and an absorption at 604 nm appeared due to the formation of the protonated dye. Once the light was removed, the blue solution changed back to yellow in about an hour. Thin films of polycaprolactone loaded with MPAH1 and AD1 were prepared by spin casting (Figure 14.7). The loading of MPAH1 and AD are both 5 wt%. In addition, 5 wt% of triethylene glycol was added to improve proton transfer in the polymer. The greenish yellow thin film changed to greenish blue under irradiation. UV–Vis spectra of the thin\nfilm showed the decrease of absorption at 420 nm, and increase of the absorption at 590 nm. After irradiation, the UV–Vis spectrum changed back to the one before irradiation and so was the color of the film in about 10 hours. Multiple acidochromic dyes can be used together to achieve the desirable color change. For example, a hydrogel that changes from green to red upon irradiation was made by loading mPAH1, bromocresol green, and naphthyl red to a polyacrylamide hydrogel [19].\nDifferent mPAHs can be used to tune the color, stimulating wavelength, reverse rate, etc. MPAH3 (Figure 14.8) was developed to increase the stimulating wavelength. The carbazole on the phenol side functions as a strong electron donating group. The resultant push–pull electronic configuration leads to a long‐wavelength absorption with a λmax at 538 nm in ethanol. A solution of mPAH3 and bromocresol green reversibly changed from brown to yellow under 525 nm yellow light. The visual effect is interesting since the color is darker in a darker condition and lighter/warmer in a lighter condition. It may be used for developing novel camouflage materials that change the darkness of their colors according to the environmental lighting condition.\nCompared to mPAH1, the TCF‐type mPAH4 (Figure 14.9) possesses a faster reverse reaction rate and a lower dark acidity [20]. The former is desirable for fast recovery of the original color in the dark, and the latter allows the photoacid to pair with the acidochromic dyes with relatively high basicity. PHEMA films loaded with mPAH4 and different indicators including AD1, Congo red [pKa (H2O) = 4.1], Bromocreso green sodium salt [pKa (H2O) = 4.7], and neutral red [pKa (H2O) = 6.7] showed photochromic behavior under irradiation (Figure 14.9). The thin films changed color quickly under sunlight. Even indoor light can slowly change the color. The reverse reaction of mPAH4 is about 104 times faster than\n45914.4 Photo‐Controlled Fragrant‐Releasing Polymer Based on Acid‐Catalyzed Hydrolysis\nthat of mPAH1 in methanol. However, the reverse reaction is relatively slow in a polymer film. A PHEMA film containing 3 wt% of mPAH4 and 1 wt% of AD1 changed from yellow to green under 470 nm irradiation. It took about an hour for the color to change back to yellow in the dark. UV–Vis spectrum showed that ~85% of the absorbance recovered in one hour after irradiation. Heating can accelerate the color change. An irradiated film on a hot plate that was set to 80 °C changed the color back to yellow in one minute."

      "text" : "Photo‐controlled release of functional molecules has many applications in biomedical and material areas. Prior research mainly focused on grafting functional molecules via photo‐labile linkage or caging functional molecules in a photosensitive polymeric or inorganic matrix. Many of these systems required UV irradiation, which could damage the materials or bio‐tissues. Our group developed a new approach to release functional molecules with light, which is based on acid‐ catalyzed hydrolysis using mPAHs [26].\nIn this work, anisaldehyde, which is a commonly used fragrant molecule, is linked onto a diol‐grafted poly(vinyl phenol) (P1) via an acetal group (P2) (Figure 14.10). The acetal group is thermally stable in neutral conditions, but easily hydrolyzed under mild acidic conditions. P2 and mPAH1 were dissolved in deuterated acetone and water (4 : 1). The concentration of P2 was 6.6 mg ml−1, which was 8.3 mM in terms of the acetal unit. The concentration of mPAH1 was 1.0 mM. The use of deuterated solvents allowed us to study the release of anisaldehyde using NMR spectroscopy. Upon irradiation with 470 nm LED, the NMR showed the emergence of new peaks corresponding to free anisaldehyde, indicating the release of anisaldehyde from the polymer. However, when the light was turned off, the anisaldehyde peaks kept increasing, indicating that the acidity in the solution was still high enough to catalyze the hydrolysis of the acetal group. In fact, NMR also showed that the photoacid was still in the acidic state due to its slow reverse reaction.\nAs described in the previous sections, mPAH2 possesses a much faster reverse reaction than does mPAH1. In the 4 : 1 mixture of acetone and water, the rate constants of the second order reverse reactions of mPAH1 and mPAH2 are 3.5 and 190 M−1 s−1, respectively. The reverse reaction of mPAH2 is 50 times faster than that of mPAH1. As described above, this type of mPAH reverses faster in water than in organic solvents. Therefore, we increased the amount of water in the solvent mixture. The reverse reaction rate of mPAH2 in a 2 : 1 mixture of acetone and water was measured to be 832 M−1 s−1. Ideally, an aqueous solution would maximize the reverse reaction rate. However, the content of water in the solvent is limited by the solubility of the polymer.\nMPAH2 and P2 in 2 : 1 deuterated acetone and water were studied by NMR. NMR spectra were taken after every five minutes of irradiation (Figure 14.11).\nResults showed that the percentage of the released anisaldehyde increased linearly with irradiation time (Figure 14.12). After the light was turned off, the peaks of anisaldehyde did not increase with time, indicating that the release stopped immediately. No increase of the anisaldehyde peaks was observed even after the sample was kept overnight in the dark. In addition, peaks of mPAH2 was the same in all of the NMR spectra since the mPAH2 already changed back to the low acidity form before NMR was taken.\nThese results indicate that the release of the fragrance can be effectively controlled by turning on and off the irradiation. It is worth mentioning that the polymer carrier P1 are re‐obtained after release of all the anisaldehyde, and the photoacids are reversible. They may be recycled to reduce the cost of the material. Although the method described here can only be applied to aldehydes and ketones, other types of functional molecules such as alcohols and amines may also be released by acid‐catalyzed cleavage reactions using similar systems. The application may also be extended to drug delivery, etc.\n462 14 Photoresponsive Soft Materials Based on Reversible Proton Transfer"

      "text" : "Stimulus‐responsive polymer nanoparticles are polymer nanoparticles that respond to external stimuli, for example, light, pH, temperature, ionic strength, and electric field [40]. Among these stimulating methods, photo‐irradiation, especially visible‐light irradiation, is a convenient method to alter the properties of polymers. Polymer nanoparticles are often prepared by polymerization, precipitation, or cross‐linking in a nanoconfined environment. Cross‐linking of preformed polymers is commonly used to prepare stable polymer nanoparticles. Noncovalent cross‐linking could be more sensitive to a stimulus than covalent bonding. In this work, we demonstrated that ionic and hydrogen bond cross‐ linking can be controlled by photoinduced protonation using mPAHs, which led to a polymer nanoparticle that dissolved and reformed under light and in the dark respectively [16].\nThe polymer nanoparticles used in this study were prepared by cross‐linking poly(methylacrylate‐co‐acrylic acid) (PMA‐co‐PAA) with a small amount of poly(4‐vinylpyridine) (PVPy) in methanol. The molar ratio between MA and AA in PMA‐co‐PAA was 4 : 1. The carboxylic group on PMA‐co‐PAA can form a hydrogen bond and an ionic bond with the pyridyl group on PVPy. Therefore, PVPy acted as a noncovalent cross‐linker and only a small amount of PVPy was needed. The molar ratio of the pyridyl units on PVPy to the carboxylic units on PMA‐co‐PAA was 0.15 : 1. Addition of a higher ratio of PVPy caused quick precipitation of the cross‐linked polymer. The nanoparticle suspension was stable at room temperature over days due to the negative charges of the carboxylic groups on the surface.\nThe noncovalent cross‐linking between the two polymers can be broken by protonation of the carboxylic or pyridyl group. In either case, the two units cannot form an ionic or a hydrogen bond between one other (Figure 14.13). MPAH1 was added to the nanoparticle suspension to control the cross‐linking with light. Under 470 nm LED, the cloudy suspension became transparent (Figure 14.14). The cross‐linking was broken by the proton generated from mPAH1, and the two non‐cross‐linked polymers were both dissolved in methanol. When the light was turned off, the high‐acidic state of mPAH 1 reversed back to a low‐acidic state and took back the proton. The cross‐linking between the two polymers formed again and so did the nanoparticle.\nThe size and distribution of the polymer nanoparticle were studied using a dynamic light scattering (DLS) particle size analyzer. The average size of the freshly prepared nanoparticles was 320 nm and the polydispersity index (PDI) was 0.358. After being irradiated for three minutes, the average size of the particles decreased to 20 nm and the PDI was 0.381 (Figure 14.15). The solution looked transparent. Three hours after irradiation, the polymer nanoparticles formed again and the average size was 244 nm with a PDI of 0.329. After irradiation, the nanoparticles dissolved and two polymers were evenly distributed in the solution before the nanoparticles formed again. Therefore, the reformed polymer nanoparticles became more uniform and had lower PDI.\nThe size of the nanoparticle was further confirmed by AFM (Figure  14.14) and TEM.\nThe dissolution and formation cycle of the nanoparticles’ suspension were studied by measuring the transmittance of the mixture using UV–Vis spectroscopy. The transmittance of a suspension prepared as described above was collected after the sample was repeatedly irradiated for three minutes and kept in the dark for two hours (Figure 14.16). Transmittance at 580 nm was monitored since mPAH1 does not absorb at this wavelength. The transmittance of the solution after irradiation was about 80%. After the irradiated sample was kept in the dark for two hours, the transmittance reduced to ~22% due to the reformation of the nanoparticles. The cycle could be repeated for many times (Figure 14.16). The material described here could be used for different applications. One\npotential application is as an interlayer material that is transparent during daytime and translucent during night for privacy or temperature control. In fact, we found that sunlight is strong enough to induce the photoreaction effectively. Other applications, e.g. reversible patterning and drug delivery could also be explored."

      "heading" : "14.6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "Photoinduced protonation is becoming a general approach toward different types of photoresponsive polymers. Reversible protonation of polymers can be controlled by visible light using metastable‐state photoacids. This approach has shown great potential and novel photochromic materials, fragrant‐releasing polymers, photoresponsive nanoparticles, volume change hydrogels, ionic sensors, etc. have been developed in the past years. Other types of photoreponsive materials may also be explored in the future. As described earlier, photoinduced protonation can affect hydrogen bonding and ionic bonding. Polymers with strong hydrogen and/or ionic bonding may show photomechanical behavior in the presence of a metastable‐state photoacid. Protonation can not only affect the optical properties but also the electronic properties. Protonated polyaniline possesses high conductivity while non‐protonated polyaniline is an insulator. Therefore, paring polyaniline with metastable‐state photoacids could lead to photoswitchable conducting materials. However, polyaniline has very high basicity and thus a photoacid with very low dark acidity is needed. Photoacids such as mPAH1 protonate polyaniline without irradiation.\nChallenges have emerged during the study of this type of photoresponsive materials in the past years. Proton transfer in polymers is often slow, which affects the photosensitivity and photoswitching rate. Development of novel neutral polymers with relatively fast proton diffusion rate is important for improving the performance of the photoreponsive materials. Covalently grafting mPAHs onto polymers could improve their compatibility with polymers and avoid leakage. More importantly, photoacid polymers could generate a localized proton concentration that is much higher than that of the environment. Given\n466 14 Photoresponsive Soft Materials Based on Reversible Proton Transfer\nthat biological systems are often in pH buffers, the capability of generating a localized pH change could have important implications for many biological applications. An effective method for synthesizing polymers covalently linked with metastable‐state photoacids and demonstration of photogenerated local pH change has not been reported. Such polymeric soft materials are expected to display promising properties that would be interesting for fundamental studies and technological applications and beyond. There remains a lot to understand and more to do in this enabling and emerging frontier."
