It is of significant importance to prepare carbon materials with different morphologies (carbon spheres, carbon nanowires, carbon membranes, and three-dimensional carbon nanomaterials) and porous structures (disordered and ordered structure) for various fields (adsorption, capacitor, catalyst, solar cells, and sensors). Here, we introduce the characteristics of carbon materials with different morphologies from various biomass sources (Cedar, Starch, Chitin, Straw, Bamboo, and Larch sawdust) and present a comprehensive review of the current research on the development of carbon materials with different morphologies (carbon spheres, carbon membrane, and carbon foams) from liquefied wood. We then introduce control methods (direct carbonization, hydrothermal carbonization, and liquefaction-carbonization) that have been explored to prepare carbon materials with ordered porous structures. Next, we highlight the liquefaction method for the degradation and activity transformation of wood. In particular, we focus on the fabrication, characteristics and applications of carbon materials with different morphologies and porous structures produced from liquefied wood by different control methods (ultrasonic spray pyrolysis, soft template, doping, foaming, and nano-ething). Finally, we present our perspectives on supercapacitors, which need further exploration in the future for urban traffic systems, military equipment, intelligent distributed grid systems, new energy vehicles, solar energy systems, and wind turbine systems."

The raw materials used for preparing carbon materials are primarily coal tar [23], asphalt [24], polymers and other nonrenewable resources [25]. However, owing to the urgent need for sustainable product development, the preparation of carbon materials from renewable biomass is an important subject. Wood biomass is abundant, environmentally friendly, easy to transport, and sustainable and can be used as a precursor to prepare various high value-added products. In addition, the main components of wood are similar to those of conventional fossil energy resources, such as oil and coal, which makes wood suitable for preparing carbon materials. Carbon materials should be designed with specific microtopographies and pore structures to increase their development and applicability in the future. In other words, it is important to design and control the microstructures and pore structures of carbon materials to further enhance field applications. A schematic diagram showing the main topics of this review, namely, the wood resources and the fabrication, structure, and functional design of wood-derived carbon materials, is presented in Fig. 1."

      "heading" : "2.1. Carbon spheres",
      "text" : "Carbon spheres are widely investigated due to their regular shape, low surface free energy, good biocompatibility and chemical stabilization [27]. The hydrothermal method is the most attractive route for preparing carbon spheres because it is a simple, green and environmentally friendly method [28,29].\nLignocellulose-based biomass is the most abundant renewable resource on earth and is composed of three components: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The cellulose content of this biomass ranges between 20% and 45% and is a linear β-D-glucose isomorphic polymer. Long chains of cellulose molecules further form stable crystalline regions by combining with hydrogen bonds. It is difficult to control the\nstructure of lignocellulose materials due to the highly insolubility of cellulose in water, although there are three free hydroxyl groups on each glucose base ring. However, it is possible that lignocellulose-based carbon materials with a spherical morphology can be prepared by the hydrothermal carbonization method (HTC) with water as the solution [28–30]. Carbon spheres with different sizes have been obtained from cellulose (Fig. 2a) [28], methylcellulose sol (Fig. 2b) [29], and hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) stem hemicellulose (Fig. 2c and d) [30], but different amorphous carbon spheres with uneven surfaces and nonspherical chain structures form simultaneously, resulting in a lower sphere yield (Fig. 2). Various types of carbon spheres prepared by hydrothermal methods have been widely used in adsorption, energy storage, and other related fields, as shown in Table. 1 [28–30]. However, this method still presents some potential problems and requires a high temperature and high pressure to continue for more than 4 h.\nThe ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method (USP) is another simple and green method for preparing carbon spheres. In the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis process, the liquid precursors are changed to the fog (microscale droplets) via ultrasonic treatment and quickly carbonized under high temperatures in the protection of inert gases [31–33]. The morphology and size of carbon spheres can be controlled by changing the reaction conditions, stirring speed, reactant concentration ratios, and carbonization temperature during the spray process. The USP method\ncan greatly reduce the production costs, shorten the reaction time and improve the reaction efficiency of carbon spheres. However, carbon sphere yields are relatively low, with abundant precursors and high requirements for precursor solutions. To date, very few studies have investigated the production of carbon spheres from biomass by USP method in different fields (Table. 1 [31–34]) due to the low solubility of the majority of biomass sources. It is important that insoluble biomass is converted into a soluble precursor solution."

      "heading" : "2.2. Carbon nanowires",
      "text" : "Carbon nanowires have unique nanostructures and can be considered one-dimensional materials with a wide range of applications due to their excellent electrical, thermal and mechanical properties [35].\nThe main preparation methods of carbon nanowires include chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrostatic spinning and the template method [35–37]. The CVD method is the pyrolysis of gaseous hydrocarbons at high temperatures using transition metal cobalt, iron, nickel and alloy as catalysts [38]. A highly efficient, stable, and cheap catalyst, NiSe/CF nanowire arrays can be obtained by CVD with the oxygen evolution reaction. Fig. 3 schematically shows the two-step synthesis process of the NiSe/CFs catalyst. First, metallic Ni is electroplated on the surface of CFs, and then the electroplated Ni grows NiSe nanowire arrays. The performance of NiSe/CFs is thus superior to that of commercial IrO2 catalysts [37]. By further assisted detonation, high yields of a variety of carbon nanowires with rough surfaces were fabricated by using low activity iron–nickel as a catalyst for methylene blue degradation and the photocatalysis activity of ZnS nanocrystals [39]. CVD is a chemical reduction process in which the metal ions in the bath are reduced and deposited on the surface of the substrate by a suitable reducing agent. Compared to electrochemical deposition, chemical deposition does not require rectifier power and an anode, but it is a\nhigh requirement for reducing agents. Electrostatic spinning technology is a common technology to transform carbon precursors to carbon nanowires by dissolving, spinning, curing, oxidation and carbonization processing [35]. Carbon nanowires with diameters of 200–300 nm and between 5 and 15 μm in length were prepared by electrostatic spinning and high-temperature pyrolysis from different sources of polyacrylonitrile in N,N-dimethyl formamide [40], and carboxy methyl silane [41], respectively. Electrostatic spinning is a special form of polymer fluid electrostatic atomization, in which the atomization splits the material, not producing tiny droplets; thus, the polymer can run a long distance and be ultimately solidified into fibers under the action of an electric field. However, many influencing factors, such as the molecular weight of the polymer, solution properties (viscosity, conductivity, surface tension), electromotive force, nozzle needle shape, movement rule of the collection device, and environmental parameters, may affect the process throughout the whole reaction.\nA template approach can efficiently transform carbon precursors into specific nanowire morphologies by filling the nanochannel structure matrix, resulting in further carbonization. In one study, carbon nanowires were obtained with anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) as the hard template, ethanol as the carbon source, and Co-Mo, CeO2/V2O5, ZnO/Ag, and Mn2O3 as the catalyst [17,42–47]. Carbon nanowires with uniform mesoporous structures, which exhibited diameters of 50–150 nm and lengths of 60 μm, were prepared by using phenolic resin as the carbon source, F127 as the soft template, and AAO as the hard template [48]. In addition, Au-loaded carbon nanowires with a diameter of 100 nm were obtained using sucrose as the carbon source, an AAO template, and gold chloride acid additives via carbonization and template etching [49]. In particular, hollow carbon nanowires with diameters of 20–200 nm were produced using polystyrene as the carbon source and an AAO template via solution impregnation, high-temperature carbonization and template etching because of the limitations of hard templates (AAO template) and corresponding pore size (more than 100 nm) [50]. The template method is relatively efficient and strongly controllable, but the development of new types of carbon materials with ordered structures from biomass via green processes remains a challenge."

      "heading" : "2.3. Carbon membranes",
      "text" : "Carbon membranes are a new type of inorganic membrane material with porous structures that have broad applications in gas separation due to their excellent chemical stability, thermal stability, strong corrosion resistance, and good gas permeability. The driving force of the carbon membrane for the separation of gases mainly relies on the mean free paths of gas molecules interacting with carbon membrane pores,\nwith separation mechanisms including surface diffusion, capillary condensation, Knudsen diffusion and molecular sieve grading mechanisms [51,52]. In addition, carbon membranes for gas separation often exhibit a contradictory relationship between performance and membrane permeability; when the pore size is increased, gas permeability improves, but gas separation is reduced [53]. Therefore, it is necessary to produce high-flux carbon membranes for applications requiring a high selectivity. The main factors influencing carbon membrane properties include the nature of the precursor and preparation technology conditions. Appropriate carbon membrane precursors need a good thermal stability, high carbon residue content, small bulk density, and good rigidity performances. Different carbon membranes were prepared from the precursors of polybenzimidazole, polyimide polymers, polyetherimide and polyvinylidene dichloride by mixing matrix film and carbon film and high-temperature carbonization [52–55]. Moreover, different renewable nanocarbon membranes were prepared from polyurethane and furfural as a polymer precursor via high temperature carbonization [56,57]. Molecular sieve carbon membranes were prepared by coating the polymer on the pore coating tube [58]. The coating adhesive requires the early curing to be slow, preferably with a period of 3–5 days without curing, followed by a quick heating period of 3–5min. Another hydrogen-containing carbon membrane was obtained from the decomposition of acetylene by magnetron sputtering technology, which can be achieved by sudden bursts of a liquid, gas, or granular solid. In this process, the membrane thickness was 0.5mm, and the pore diameter was 0.58–0.63 nm, which enabled the separation of the mixed solution of benzene and 2,2-dimethyl butane [59]; this method was simple but had a poor safety factor. Based on the above research, the preparation of wood-derived carbon membranes with excellent gas permeation and separation performances via simple preparation technology will have a significant role in developing sustainable products."

      "text" : "Three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanomaterials, which have different structures and morphologies, have excellent electrical, optical and magnetic properties. Carbon foam, a new carbon material, has a pentagonal dodecahedron and spherical porous structure. Pentagonal dodecahedron carbon foam exhibits a poor graphite structure and large open and columnar ligaments. In contrast, pitch-based carbon foam has a higher softening temperature, smaller graphite layer spacing, a larger size, a tighter lattice arrangement and less cracks [60]. Coal-based carbon foam with a 3D microporous structure was prepared by twostage carbonization at 450–500 and 1000 °C. The samples exhibited excellent relative density, and the sample tenacity was attributed to the rheological property of carbon foam, although the foam had a low resistivity [61].\n3D carbon nanotubes have a relatively stable network connection of nanotubes. In one study, carbon nanotubes were prepared by solution\n[62], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [63], and ultrasonic-assisted methods [38]. The connected architecture mechanism of carbon nanotubes depends on catalyst particle formation, top growth, catalyst scattering, branch growth, stop growing, and wall thickness [16,63–68]. 3D carbon nanotubes with large pores were prepared from resorcinol, formaldehyde, and sodium carbonate via an ultrasonic-assisted method [69]. The results indicated different ratios of resorcinol and sodium effect pore size. The special morphology 3D structure of the samples could improve the sample electrical conductivity."

Commonly, carbon materials with specific morphologies but disordered porous structures are prepared from different sources (organic or biomass) without any template and applied in different fields in Table 2 [70–74]. However, the disordered structure of these carbon materials may limit their application range. It is of great importance to develop novel materials with ordered pores to achieve breakthrough applications."

      "heading" : "3.2. Ordered structure",
      "text" : "Ordered mesoporous structures can not only provide a larger specific surface area but can also improve the mass transfer in a gas or solution; thus, the preparation of mesoporous carbon materials with ordered structures is highly desirable. The preparation method of mesoporous carbon mainly includes organic gel-carbonization, catalytic activation-carbonization and template-carbonization. However, it is difficult to effectively control the pore structure and size and the pore size distribution of mesoporous carbon materials prepared by catalytic activation and organic gel-carbonization. The template method can further overcome the shortcomings of the above, which is not only simple, time-saving and efficient but also capable of generating carbon materials with ordered pore structures and sizes. The template method is based on the introduction of a template with a special structure into the carbon precursor, followed by carbonization to remove the template. This process mainly requires hard or soft templates.\nIn hard template synthesis, a wide range of carbon sources, including furfuryl alcohol, sucrose, naphthalene, sucrose, ethylene, resin and other substances, can be selected [75–77]. A mesoporous carbon material, CMK-3, with a reverse topological structure was synthesized with SBA-15 as the template (Fig. 4a) [75]. CMK-3 exhibited a highly ordered one-dimensional carbon nanorod with a six-square-dense pile structure, a narrow pore diameter distribution, and a high surface area. Moreover, a mesoporous carbon CMK-5 with a one-dimensional carbon nanotube array structure was obtained when the channel of SBA-15 was partially filled (Fig. 4b) [76]. Furthermore, SNU-2 was synthesized with SBA-15 as a soft template and showed a small hole or small mesoporous channel in a one-dimensional straight channel (Fig. 4c) [77]; the structure of SNU-2 was relatively complicated. However, the above method is not suitable for large-scale industrial production because the synthesis process is complex and can produce harmful by-products.\nCompared with hard templates, soft templates could effectively control the porous structures because the precursors and soft template spontaneously assembled into ordered supramolecular structures by weaker nonchemical bonds followed by direct carbonization.\nThe use of block copolymers as a common type of soft template could effectively control morphology via the amphipathicity performance of these copolymers and lead to different structures and sizes according to the solubility of different blocks and critical micelle concentrations [78,79]. When the surfactant concentration is greater than the critical micelle concentration, van der Waals and electrostatic forces are dominant, and further surface active molecules can form lamellar, globular, or rod structures to minimize the Gibbs free energy throughout the system [78]. If the micelle concentration increases to a certain extent, the micelle will transform into liquid crystal. Although the resulting molecular structure is disordered in the arrangement, it can show a one-dimensional or two-dimensional long-range orderliness in structural orientation [78]. The essential process of forming the liquid crystal phase of the surfactant is the formation of an ordered alignment by van der Waals forces and electrostatic interactions. According to the arrangement and shape of the molecular structure, mesoporous materials with different pore structures and morphologies can be designed from polymers and surfactant molecules [78,79].\nCopolymers can be categorized into four groups: random, alternating, block and graft copolymer types. A copolymer is formed by preforming a segment between individual monomers and then arranging the segments. The block copolymer self-assembly capacity is the basis of the effective preparation of an ordered mesoporous structure. Block copolymer formation is an important factor to control the different topographies (spherical, membranous, columnar and some complex multistage pores) and pore structures (ordered structure and disordered structure) of polymers. Hydrophilic-hydrophobic compounds are the most common surfactants for regulating pore structures. Hydrophilic ends are usually polar or ionic groups (cationic, nonionic and bisexual), and the hydrophobic ends usually have a hydrocarbon structure with one or more chains [78]. In the preparation process, the properties of mesoporous materials mainly depend on the properties of the surfactants under self-assembly (Fig. 5) [79].\nThere are three most common types of block copolymers: copolymers including polyethylene oxide (poly real (ethylene oxide), PEO) and two types of poly (propylene oxide (poly real (propylene oxide), PPO) polymers. A hydrophobic block is located at the center of PPO, and there is a hydrophilic group at both ends of PEO. A large number of hydrophilic groups are produced by the self-assembly reaction of the block copolymer with the thermosetting resin, followed by further thermal polymerization, and the mesoscopic phase is formed by the block copolymer. Explorations of thermosetting resin and investigations of the formation mechanisms of ordered structures by self-assembly reactions with block copolymers are promising. Because block\ncopolymers have different solubilities, the supermolecular structure can be arranged spontaneously by the hydrophobic block of the central block copolymer and the hydrophilic blocks at both ends, and an intermediate phase can be further formed by the self-assembly of the body of organic carbon materials with ordered structures via direct carbonization [80]. Dai and coworkers reported the production of ordered mesoporous carbon via organic-organic self-assembly synthesis [81]. Block copolymer PS-P4VP (polystyrene-blockpoly (4 vinylpyridine)) and resorcinol were used as the template and carbon source, respectively, and were highly crosslinked, forming mesophase. Finally, ordered mesoporous carbon films were obtained after high-temperature carbonization. A mesoporous carbon with a hexagonal structure, COU1, was prepared from resorcinol and formaldehyde as the raw materials and three block copolymers as the soft template agents via the organicorganic self-assembly and carbonization method [82]. Zhao and coworkers have conducted many studies on organic-organic self-assembled and ordered mesoporous carbon materials. The ordered carbons FDU15 with P6mm and FDU-16 with cubic Im3m were prepared from a phenolic resin prepolymer and triblock copolymer by a solvent evaporation-induced self-assembly process (Fig. 6) [83]. In addition, an ordered carbon, FDU-18, with a face-centered cubic structure was obtained from large molecular weight PEO-b-PS block copolymers as a soft template. The results exhibited that porous size mainly depends on the hydrophobic length, and the pore size of FDU-18 can be controlled in the 12–33 nm range by changing the length of the PS chain. Mesoporous carbons with different structures were prepared from resole with three block copolymers, i.e., P123, F127 and F108, by adjusting the ratio between the resin and soft template.\nThe use of block copolymers as soft templates can effectively control the pore structure of carbon materials by changing and adjusting the template agent under different high-temperature carbonizations. However, preparing carbon materials with ordered structures from renewable resources is still a challenge, and the state selection of renewable resources (liquid state) is the basis for controlling ordered carbon materials. An urgent topic in the regulation of the ordered structure of carbon materials is the exploration of the self-assembly between block copolymers and wood liquefaction."

      "text" : "Lignocellulosic material consists of hemicellulose (15–35%), cellulose (30–50%) and lignin (20–35%) interconnected by covalent or\nnoncovalent forces [84]. The preparation of carbon materials from wood biomass by direct carbonization depends on the wood biomass components. The decomposition of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin results in a large amount of porosity and yields a stable carbon framework after carbonization [85], but the resultant products possess low controllability. Therefore, carbonization conditions (temperature and time) and pretreatments (doping and activation) are key factors for tuning porosity and pore size (macropore, mesopore, and micropore). Kurosaki et al. [86] developed a facile route for the synthesis of hierarchical carbon materials (micropores, mesopores, and macropores) with high surface areas by flash heating from cedar sawdust. Ahn et al. [87] investigated the utilization of wood biomass char for the synthesis of carbon fuel. Furthermore, Mao et al. [88] prepared wood-derived carbon with a large surface area and high porosity (porous volume: 0.96 cm3/g; specific surface area: 2044m2/g) by KOH activation using waste pine, but the presence of abundant micropores hindered the mass transfer of electrolytes. Deng et al. [89] reported a one-pot approach for the preparation of hierarchically porous carbons (HPCs) (Fig. 7). Chen et al. [90] reported novel nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets with abundant micropores derived from an accessible plant (Typha orientalis).\nGenerally, the specific surface area and total pore volume increase with increasing carbonization temperature, activation temperature and the extension of activation time. Carbon with a large diameter and wide\npore size distribution is prepared at a low carbonization temperature; the pore sizes decrease with increases in the activation temperature. In addition, pore control can be achieved by the amount of active agent.\nDirectly tuning the morphology and porous network of carbon materials from woody biomass is difficult because of the convoluted physical and chemical interactions and attendant complex microarchitecture of the resident cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. Therefore, a huge technical obstacle is faced in the preparation of carbon materials with a controlled structure via traditional methods. The dissolution-controlled polymerization carbonization method provides a promising route for carbon synthesis but remains a great challenge."

      "heading" : "4.2. Hydrothermal carbonization",
      "text" : "Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) represents a simple technology for biomass conversion that has experienced a sudden increase in attention in recent years. HTC is a flexible technology using bio-based and waste feedstocks such as wood, waste, and crops [91]. In hydrothermal carbonization, wood-derived biomass is converted to biocrude at temperatures below 400 °C over short periods, which is economically feasible in continuous reactors [92]. During the hydrothermal process, hydrolysis, ring opening, aldol condensation, aromatic condensation, polymerization and etherification reactions occur continuously. During degradation, cellulose is mainly degraded into glucose and then isomerized to fructose, which is then subjected to dehydration, fragmentation and reorganization to form various soluble products [93]. Hemicellulose is mainly hydrolyzed into pentose, xylan, mannan and other related oligomers and can be further hydrolyzed into furfural products [93,94]. Lignin is degraded mainly by the cleavage of ether and CeC bonds [94]. With the continuous increase in reaction time, a series of reactions occurs in the derivatives of furans, resulting in aldol condensation and acetal and ring opening reactions, generating a large number of aromatic structures, poly-ring structures, and levulinic acid,\nformic acid, acetaldehyde, ketones, carboxylic acids, water and other small molecules [95]. Subsequently, intermolecular dehydration and aldol condensation occur between hydrothermal reaction intermediates (furans and benzene derivatives). Finally, condensation, linear polymerization, and decarbonylation occur to form the final polyaromatic and furan structures, ether linkages, alkanes, hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, and oligomers, and a large number of carboxylic acids exist in the liquid products [96]. The morphology of carbon materials can be regulated by small molecules with high controllability for the degradation of macromolecules in hydrothermal processes. These porous structures improve the capacitance and electrical conductivity of supercapacitors, as shown in Table 3.\nWoody biomass precursors have been investigated as hydrothermal feedstocks with residues between 17 and 68wt% [95]. The transformation of wood-derived waste into advanced functional materials with different morphologies and pore sizes is very simple. However, the preparation of wood-derived carbon materials with adjustable pore structures currently poses research difficulties. To control the pore structure of carbon materials by template synthesis, the precursor should be liquid, and the template should be polymerized with a liquid precursor. However, it is necessary to introduce an effective transformation technology to improve the feasibility of this method. Liquefaction technology can convert solid wood into alcohols, combustible oils or other compounds with particular hydroxyl groups, which is beneficial for further polymerization into biomass-based polymers."

      "heading" : "4.3. Liquefaction-carbonization",
      "text" : "In fact, it is difficult to directly prepare carbon materials with a regular morphology and a tunable porous structure from wood is due to the carbonization of wood cannot involve a melting step. Therefore, the effective method is worth paying attention to solve this problem. Firstly, liquefaction method is an effective approach to take place in solvents and can directly convert whole biomass into liquids and further achieve high effective utilization and development of wood waste. Secondly, this method can convert lignocellulosic materials into lowmolecular-weight chemicals, which used as a replacement of phenolic composites and polyhydroxy alcohol in the synthesis of carbon precursor due to the liquefied wood with abundant hydroxyl groups. Importantly, the obtained liquid products with low-molecular-weight and abundant hydroxyl groups as feedstock, can be further regulated\nand controlled the morphology and porous structure of carbon precursor by mix different template and polymers.\nThe liquefaction of wood refers to the chemical processes in which solvents react with components in wood and transform into small molecules, and the products with active groups can be used to manufacture new types of high molecular substances and greatly improve the utilization of wood resources. The wood components are decomposed to low molecular weight intermediate products with high reactivities, and this step is followed by condensation with intermediates; thus, new polymers are formed. Although the structure of lignin is more complex than that of cellulose and hemicellulose, it is relatively easy to tune lignin structures. Wood phenol liquefaction products should be converted into phenolic compounds, effectively converting the wood into highly active products and further controlling the morphology and porosity of wood-derived carbon [97]. High levels of liquefied wood with abundant hydroxyl groups are made by transforming wood into micromolecular, low-molecular-weight chemicals [98,99], which may be used to replace phenols in composite applications [100,101]. However, liquefaction mechanisms are the conversion of the main components (cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin) in the biomass. The mechanisms of liquefaction are complex because more than one reaction (physically or chemically) occurs simultaneously. The reactions are competing each other and rates are affected by liquefaction conditions such as temperature, solvents, and catalysts. The basic reactions involve (Fig. 8): the depolymerization of lignocellulose; the chemical and thermal decomposition of monomers by cleavage, dehydration, dehydrogenation, deoxygenation, and decarboxylation; the rearrangement of reactive fragments through condensation, cyclisation, and polymerization [102].\nIn the 1970s, carbon foam was prepared from liquefied soft wood by Klett [103]. Subsequently, carbon materials with ordered porous structures were obtained from liquefied Eucalyptus and olive with a high heating rate and short activation time [104,105]. The liquefaction of wood and the thermal effects of hydrothermal biomass liquefaction have been explored [106,107]. Many bio-oils, bio-resins and liquid hydrocarbons have been synthesized from pinewood sawdust [108], cypress [109], bamboo shoot shell [110], paulownia [111], switchgrass [112], and distiller grains [113]. Specifically, oak tree bark was liquefied under mild conditions with different mass ratios of biomass/ phenol; then, the liquefaction product of polyol was used to fabricate porous resin foams. The as-obtained resin foams were carbonized at lower temperatures (< 400 °C) and further activated at high temperatures (> 800 °C) under nitrogen [114]. Thus, a novel way to prepare carbon fibers from phenol-liquefied poplar bark with a one-step activation approach was developed, in which the micropore size was mainly distributed in the range of 0.4–0.8 nm [115]. A type of liquefied wood-based carbon fiber with mesoporous and microporous features was prepared by different activation methods for methylene blue adsorption [116,117]. Furthermore, a series of carbon fibers using wood as carbon sources were prepared by liquefication, electrostatic spinning and physical activation, and the effects of carbonization temperature and activation time on the structures and adsorption properties were further explored [118–124]. In the above mentioned reactions,\nresearchers mostly paid attention to phenol liquefaction. Phenol liquefaction is the process of using phenols as a solvent to liquefy wood via steam or high temperatures, generate active substances and decompose macromolecules into small molecules. Under acidic conditions, lignin homogeneously forms lytic, pronose and guaiac free radicals, and then pine primary alcohol-free radicals with branched conjugate double bonds continue to react with phenol free radicals, producing a series of corresponding phenolic products [116]. Cellulose degrades into oligosaccharides at high temperatures, decomposing into glucose and is subsequently dehydrated to form 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, which reacts with phenol-formed compounds containing a furan ring structure, leading to crosslinking reactions [118]. The hemicelluloses of hardwood are mainly degraded into pentosan, and the hemicellulose of softwood is mainly degraded into hexan. The higher the phenolic compound content in the product, the better the physical and mechanical properties and biodegradability of the reaction product will be [125–127]. The conversion of wood and further synthesis of new materials from liquefication products is a focus topic. However, the preparation of wood-based new carbon materials with controllable pore structures using liquefaction technology and further combining these materials with template methods from wood has rarely been explored. Wood-derived carbon with different morphologies and structures was prepared by combining liquefication and soft templates from wood residues in our research group.\nA novel carbon foam with a high porosity was prepared from birch sawdust by phenol liquefied under acidic conditions and then reacted with formaldehyde under alkaline conditions and underwent polysorbate and n-pentane foaming under sulfuric acid and high-temperature carbonization under nitrogen [125]. The carbon foam exhibited abundant micropores and ordered porous structures after KOH activation [125]. To further optimize the performance and pore structures of the carbon foam, different wood residents (Larch sawdust) were chosen as sources for the preparation of wood-based carbon foam (Fig. 9) [126]. The degree of foaming, porous structures and pore diameters of larch-derived carbon foam was further controlled by introducing polyethylene glycol as a pore-forming agent. The ligaments, nodes, and cell walls of the carbon foam became stable and strong after carbonization, and micropores and mesopores increased and ordered gradually with increasing polyethylene glycol content; this optimization approach achieved a high adsorption ability for vitamin B12 [126].\nA type of wood-derived carbon sphere was prepared from waste larch sawdust by successive liquefaction, resinification, triblock copolymer self-assembly, and high-temperature carbonization. Owing to the evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) of the soft template (F127) in the presence of the larch resin precursor under hydrothermal\nconditions, spherical particles were formed by polymerization at a high temperature. Furthermore, the carbon spheres displayed a uniform and hierarchical micromesoporous structure, mesopores were generated upon the decomposition of F127, and micropores were formed upon KOH activation, as shown in Fig. 10 [127]. Carbon spheres (10–25 μm) possessed a high surface area of 1064m2/g, a large pore volume of 0.503 cm3/g, and abundant mesopores (2.0–5.0 nm) and micropores (1.5–2.0 nm). The metal ion adsorption capacities of the hierarchically defined carbon spheres were as follows: for Cr(III) and Pb(II), the removal rates were 70% and 90%, respectively [127]. The results suggested that the effect of evaporation-induced self-assembly could maintain sphere morphology stability and integrity, but the pore structures changed after KOH activation.\nOther larch sawdust-derived mesoporous carbon spheres were synthesized by the coupling of the soft-template (triblock copolymer F127) and hydrothermal methods. The sphere shapes and porous structures could be tuned by changing the carbonization temperature [128]. The morphology and pore structures of the larch-derived carbon spheres were further controlled by different concentrations of the triblock copolymer F127 (PEO–PPO–PEO) and carbonization temperature, as shown in Fig. 11. The morphology changed from spherical to raspberrylike, and the particle size decreased with increasing F127 concentrations. The pore structure transformed from spiral-like to vermicular-like to wave-like as the carbonization temperature was increased. The results showed that perfect carbon spheres were achieved when the concentration of F127 was 6% in these reaction conditions.\nIn particular, a facile strategy for the preparation of carbon materials is desirable. Larch-derived carbon spheres were successfully prepared using liquefication and ultrasonic spray pyrolysis techniques, a promising method for generating carbon spheres using a nebulizer and tubular furnace. This method is suitable for the continuous production of lightweight spherical particles from low-volatility precursors; the particles can be rapidly carbonized and collected to obtain the carbon spheres, as shown in Fig. 12 [129]. The morphology and porous structure of the carbon spheres were investigated at different solution concentrations and carbonizations. The size of the obtained carbon spheres increased from 600 to 900 nm at 5% solution concentration to 0.6–1.5 μm and 0.6–2.0 μm at 10% and 15% solution concentration, respectively. The obtained optimal carbon spheres possessed optimal hollow, honeycomb-like structures, uniform sizes (600–900 nm), and narrow pore size distributions (1.8–2.5 nm). The well-developed porous structure and uniform size distribution endowed these carbon spheres with 140mg/g methyl orange adsorption capacity [129], and these carbon materials are promising candidates for adsorbents [122,130–142], as shown in Table 4.\nCarbon membranes with ordered mesopores were obtained from liquefied larch sawdust that displayed interactions with copolymers via a soft template method. The mesoporosity was controlled from disordered to ordered by varying the carbonization temperature. A mesoporous carbon membrane with an ordered two-dimensional hexagonal porous structure with P6 mm symmetry was obtained at 700 °C. The unique ordered mesoporous structure of the carbon membranes provided a high efficiency for the separation of CO2 from N2 (permselectivity factor= 1.97) [143]. Furthermore, larch-derived carbon membranes with a higher gas permeability were further prepared by introducing Ni(NO3)2 solution into liquefied larch sawdust, as shown in Fig. 13 [144], and the pore structures were further tailored by the introduction of different amounts of Ni(NO3)2. The size of the Ni and NiO nanoparticles was 10 nm, and these nanoparticles were incorporated into the carbon frameworks. The shrinkage of carbon frameworks and the ratio of mesopores/mesopores is key to gas permeability and selectivity. Meanwhile, liquefied wood-derived carbon fibers with a 2400m2/g specific surface area and a 1.530 cm3/g pore volume were synthesized via steam-KOH reactivation when the reactivation time increased to 3 h; the small mesopores in these fibers ranging from 2 to 10 nm contributed to 66.8% of the total volume [145].\nCarbon membranes with two-dimensional structures were prepared from larch liquefication and a soft template (F127) and possessed a high specific surface area (469m2/g), pore volume (0.250 cm3/g), and microporous content (87%). However, carbon membranes with spherical structures were prepared from larch liquefication and a soft template\n(P123) and had a high specific surface area (393m2/g), pore volume (0.237 cm3/g), and microporous content (77%). The effect of the ratio of the hydrophilic groups to the hydrophobic groups on the pore structures of carbon materials was studied by controlling the dosage ratio of F127 and P123. When there were equal amounts of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups in the block copolymer, the mutual inhibition of the two groups made the pore structure disordered, but the material had a higher specific surface area (637m2/g). As the ratio of hydrophilic/hydrophobic groups increased or decreased, the interference effect decreased gradually, and the pore structure presented an ordered structure. With the increase in the hydrophobic groups, the curvature of the interface decreased, and the structure of spherical ordered pores was formed. With the increase in hydrophilic groups, the curvature of the interface increased, forming a strip of two-dimensional ordered porous structures. Interestingly, the porous structures showed a distinct change from vortex-like to worm-like pores to stripe-like pores and to ordered two-dimensional hexagonal pores as the ratio of hydrophilic/ hydrophobic units increased, indicating the significant effect of the EO/ PO ratio on the porous structure. The results indicated that different porous structures and pore sizes of larch-based mesoporous carbons can be tuned by adjusting the hydrophilic/hydrophobic (EO/PO) ratios in the mixture of F127 and P123. The hydrophilic/hydrophobic (EO/PO) ratio is a key issue for porous structure control because this ratio can lead to different interfacial curvatures, as shown in Fig. 14 [146]. Mesoporous carbons used as supercapacitor electrodes exhibited a superior electrochemical capacitive performance and a high degree of\nreversibility after 2000 cycles for supercapacitors due to the well-defined mesoporosity of the carbon materials. Meanwhile, the superior carbon had a high specific capacitance of 107 F/g in 6M KOH at a current density of 10 A/g. However, there is still much room to improve the electrochemical properties of wood-derived carbon [146].\nIt is noteworthy that the preparation of composite carbon with an excellent performance could enhance the applications of this carbon product. Carbon foam has been prepared from larch for electroless deposition [126]. Liquefied larch is polymerized with formaldehyde to obtain thermosetting resin with a proper viscosity under the control of polyethylene glycol (PEG). The resulting composites were mixed with polysorbate 80, and thermosetting carbon foam with a stable framework was synthesized by foaming and curing with the aid of sulfuric acid. Foam was used as a substrate for electroless nickel plating, and the morphology of materials was controlled by the sensitization and activation conditions. The results indicated that nickel with a conical structure was vertically formed on the surface of the foam with a 40−50° slope in very low concentrations of sensitization and activation solution, and the height was approximately 100–250 nm, which displayed the outstanding glucose sensing performance. The sensitivity of materials to glucose was up to 8.1 mA/mM/cm2, and the limit of detection reached 60 nm, indicating a better performance than that of many noble metal-based catalysts (Fig. 15) [147].\nCarbon nanowires with superstructures were synthesized using iontrack etched polymers as a soft method followed by a nanocasting process. In the synthesis process, polycarbonate with multiple inclined arrays was used as a template, followed by resin filling and crosslinking at a moderate temperature. Finally, the template was removed with high temperature carbonization to obtain interconnected network carbon nanowires. The diameter of the carbon nanowires was up to 300 nm, and the length of the carbon nanowires reached 10 μm. This interconnected network morphology can improve the physical and chemical performances of carbon nanowires (Fig. 16) [148]."

      "text" : "Supercapacitors are a new type of energy storage device and have attracted considerable attention due to their high power density, long life, wide temperature range and rapid charging/discharging rate characteristics. Carbon materials are widely applied in supercapacitor applications due to their high surface area, controlled porous and inert structures and chemical properties. Moreover, these parameters affect the performance of supercapacitors (Fig. 17) [149]. Intensive investigations have explored the construction of wood-derived carbons for supercapacitors. Our group prepared carbon spheres with ordered structures from biomass residue liquefaction and its resin solution by\nultrasonic spray pyrolysis processes, and these materials exhibited highly desired electrical double-layer capacitors (Fig. 18) [150].\nModification of woody waste biomass plays an increasingly important role in the fabrication of nanostructured carbon materials. Recently, research has focused on biomass-derived carbon from a highperformance supercapacitor by heteroatom doping. Xu et al. prepared porous carbon materials from shells by sulfur and nitrogen coating that could be used as electrode materials [151]. The specific capacitance of the carbon electrode materials was as high as 202 F/g and provided a superior cycling performance for electric double layer capacitor densities at 0.5 A/g. Nitrogen-rich porous carbon with 3D porous nanostructures and a high surface area (1300m2/g) derived from ox horns was successfully prepared and demonstrated a high reversible capacity (1181mA h/g at a current density of 100mA/g) and superior rate capability (304mA h/g at 5 A/g) [152]. Nitrogen-doped carbons with two-dimensional structures that were efficient bifunctional ORR/HER electrocatalysts were prepared from biomass via a hydrothermal carbonization method [153].\nLiu et al. developed a green activation method that consisted of a one-step calcium chloride activation sugar cane bagasse with urea for\nthe preparation of nitrogen-rich porous carbons [154]. The synthesized 3D -oriented and interlinked porous nitrogen-rich carbons not only contained abundant porosities for ion buffering and accommodation but also had a high nitrogen content for pseudocapacitance. The materials showed high specific capacitances of 323 and 213 F/g at current densities of 1 and 30 A/g, respectively, with an outstanding cycling performance (negligible capacitance loss after 10,000 cycles at 5 A/g). Wei et al. [155] used Broussonetia papyrifera as a source to prepare nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials with a high BET surface area (1212m2/g) via a two-step fabrication process, and this material showed an excellent capacitive performance (320 F/g at 0.5 A/g) and high cycling stability [145] directly prepared micromesoporous carbon fiber from liquefied wood by electrostatic spinning, carbonization and activation, and found that the effect of specific surface area on the capacitive performance was superior to the effects of many competing materials in terms of rate capability and cycling stability. A type of carbon nanosphere was prepared from oil palm for supercapacitors due to its high surface area (1704m2/g), high specific capacitance (343 F/ g), and cycle life of approximately 2500 cycles [156]. Another carbon nanosphere was prepared from a Scaphium scaphigerum precursor, with\nNH3·H2O as a precipitator. The electrochemical performance of the resultant product had a specific capacitance of 2770 F/g and showed a 93.4% retention after 500 cycles [157]. Importantly, the production of wood-derived carbon materials for supercapacitors has been ongoing.\nWood-based carbon for supercapacitor is a promising area. In recent years, wood biomass and waste are needed to resolve current issues of energy production including environmental degradation, raw material shortages and increasing energy demand [158]. As a kind of new materials, wood derived carbon materials have demonstrated outstanding energy storage than polymer and metal composite materials due to their stability and porosity, its abundant pore structure can provide charge transmission channel and storage space, further improve the reversibility of charge and discharge and cycle life [159]. As well as wood derived carbon materials with integrated ordered three-dimensional structure could offer a great choice for electrodes and greatly simplify the electrode preparation process.\nImportantly, wood liquefication can provide a simple and feasible reaction condition for improving electrochemical performance and enhance electrochemical activity and durability through introduce the active site or change the electron distribution and planar conjugate structure of the carbon carrier of carbon material by doping non-metals and metals method."

      "heading" : "6. Conclusions and outlook",
      "text" : "Various carbon materials with different morphologies (carbon sphere, carbon nanowire, carbon membrane, and three-dimensional carbon nanomaterials) could be synthesized from biomasses by different methods and applied in different fields (adsorption, catalysis, supercapacitor, etc.). Carbon spheres could be prepared by simple and environmentally friendly methods (hydrothermal and ultrasonic spray pyrolysis) but are not secure enough due to the high temperature and high pressure for hydrothermal carbonization, and the yield of carbon spheres is relatively low for ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. Carbon nanowires have further been synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrostatic spinning and template methods. However, the CVD method has high requirements for reducing agents, and too many factors may affect the electrostatic spinning reaction. Carbon membranes can be obtained by coating and magnetron sputtering technology, which is simple but has a high time requirement and poor safety factor. Therefore, it is important to prepare biomass-derived carbon spheres, membranes, and nanowires with controlled microstructures and pore structures and excellent performances via simple technologies. The template method has been shown to be relatively simple, efficient, and strongly controllable, but the use of green sources remains a concern.\nWood biomass is abundant, environmentally friendly, easily transportable, and sustainable and can be used as a precursor to prepare various high value-added products. The fabrication of wood-derived carbon materials with different morphologies and disordered hierarchical structures has been achieved from different types of wood (Japanese\ncedar, starch, chitin, straw, bamboo) by direct carbonization and hydrothermal carbonization. However, the morphology and pore structure of carbon materials could be simply controlled by template synthesis when the precursor is liquid, and the template can be further polymerized with a liquid precursor. It is necessary to introduce an\neffective transformation technology to improve the feasibility of this method. Wood-based liquefaction combined with a soft template is beneficial to induce the orderly arrangement of the pore structure of carbon materials, the regulation of multistage pore structures, and further polymerization, doping and modifications into biomass-based polymers.\nCarbon materials with different morphologies and ordered mesoporous structures were successfully prepared from wood sources by liquefication, the template method and further carbonization. A novel carbon foam with abundant micropores and ordered porous structures was prepared from birch sawdust by liquification, resinification, foaming, and KOH activation, and this foam had a high vitamin B12\nadsorption ability. A type of wood-derived carbon sphere was prepared from waste larch sawdust by successive liquefaction, resinification, triblock copolymer self-assembly, and high-temperature carbonization. Carbon spheres (10–25 μm) with a high surface area and abundant pores were obtained by soft-template and ultrasonic spray pyrolysis methods and applied in metal ion adsorption, methyl orange adsorption, and electrochemistry. The sphere shapes (smooth, hollow, honeycomb-like structure) and porous structures (spherical pores, wormlike pores, and two-dimensional hexagonal pores) could be tuned by changing the carbonization temperature, controlling the specifics and the concentrations of the soft template. Carbon membranes with ordered mesoporous structures (two-dimensional hexagonal and spherical\nstructures) were obtained from liquefied larch sawdust that displayed interactions with copolymers via a soft template method (F127 and P123). The mesoporosity could be varied from disordered to ordered by varying the carbonization temperature. The uniquely ordered mesoporous structure of carbon membranes provided a high efficiency for the separation of CO2 from N2 (permselectivity factor= 1.97). Furthermore, the permeability of larch-derived carbon membranes was enhanced by introducing Ni(NO3)2, resulting in the shrinkage of carbon frameworks and an optimal mesopore/mesopore ratio. Carbon nanowires with superstructures were synthesized using ion-track etched polymers as a soft method followed by a nanocasting process.\nCarbon materials with regular morphologies and orders can produce electric double layer capacitor structures based on carbon electrode/ electrolyte interface charge separation. The rich and ordered pore structures of these materials can provide transport channels and storage space for charge, thus improving the reversibility and cycle life of charge and discharge. It is noteworthy that the key technology for further enhancing the high performance of wood-derived carbon supercapacitors can be achieved by further heteroatom doping. Heteroatom doping (metal, and nonmetal) can change the electric distribution of the carbon lattice and improve the electrochemical activity of the carrier and persistence, generating the electric double layer capacitor and the constraint of the collaborative energy storage capacitor. Wood-derived carbon supercapacitors can be readily used as a novel material for newly emerging energy storage systems via the control of the structure and doping active sites of wood-derived sources. Furthermore, high-performance, renewable, wood-derived air cathode is designed by a simple method, which provides a feasible path for the design of lithium-air battery cathode.\nWith the rapid consumption of nonrenewable resources and increasing energy requirements, it is extremely urgent to seek ecofriendly sources, research high performance energy conversion and explore storage devices. Supercapacitors have been extensively considered very promising elements of energy storage applications due to their high power capability, excellent cycling stability, and long cycle life. There is a need for urban traffic systems, military equipment, intelligent distributed grid systems, new energy vehicles, solar energy systems, and wind turbine systems.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare."

    "abstractText" : "Wood has emerged as a sustainable and promising precursor for carbon materials owing to its natural abundance and superb properties. It is of significant importance to prepare carbon materials with different morphologies (carbon spheres, carbon nanowires, carbon membranes, and three-dimensional carbon nanomaterials) and porous structures (disordered and ordered structure) for various fields (adsorption, capacitor, catalyst, solar cells, and sensors). Here, we introduce the characteristics of carbon materials with different morphologies from various biomass sources (Cedar, Starch, Chitin, Straw, Bamboo, and Larch sawdust) and present a comprehensive review of the current research on the development of carbon materials with different morphologies (carbon spheres, carbon membrane, and carbon foams) from liquefied wood. We then introduce control methods (direct carbonization, hydrothermal carbonization, and liquefaction-carbonization) that have been explored to prepare carbon materials with ordered porous structures. Next, we highlight the liquefaction method for the degradation and activity transformation of wood. In particular, we focus on the fabrication, characteristics and applications of carbon materials with different morphologies and porous structures produced from liquefied wood by different control methods (ultrasonic spray pyrolysis, soft template, doping, foaming, and nano-ething). Finally, we present our perspectives on supercapacitors, which need further exploration in the future for urban traffic systems, military equipment, intelligent distributed grid systems, new energy vehicles, solar energy systems, and wind turbine systems.",
