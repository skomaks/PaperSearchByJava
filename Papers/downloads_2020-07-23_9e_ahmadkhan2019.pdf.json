      "text" : "The conventional materials like ethylene glycol, oils, water, etc., having lower conductivity are less impressive in heat conveying phenomenon. Thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficient of base materials can be enhanced through the insertion of nanoparticles (Choi and Eastman, 1995; Buongiorno, 2006). The composition of solid particles containing 1-100 nm size in base materials are known as nanofluids. Such approach rises heat transportation in engineering utilization for illustration electronic mechanisms chilling equipped with nanofluids, food processing, energy stowing structures, heat exchangers and lubrication equipment. Choi and Eastman (1995) experimentally evaluated nanoliquids and discussed their contribution in base material along thermal conductivity improvement of the working material. Measuring thermal conductivity of ethylene glycol fluid through copper nano-particles was examined by Eastman et al. (2001). Impact of thermal radiation on magnetic nanofluid heat transfer into a curved cavity by CVFEM numerical method was studied by Sheikholeslami and Ganji (2017). Some investigations about nanofluids theory under various aspects are discussed in Qayyum et al. (2017), Pandey and Kumar (2017),\nMixed convective non-linear radiative flow\n2755\nMahanthesh et al. (2016), Yin et al. (2017), Sheikholeslami et al. (2015), Hayat et al. (2017), Zhang et al. (2015), Mustafa et al. (2015), Hayat et al. (2013), Ellahi et al. (2015), Hayat et al. (2018), Sheikholeslami et al. (2016) and Sheikholeslami and Ganji (2017).\nVarious studies have been elaborated about nanomaterials until now, but hybrid nanoliquid is a new type of fluids, which is of great interest to the present investigation. Hybrid nanofluid is the composite of two or more constituent at nanoparticles level within a base fluid and are used to improve the heat transfer features. Suresh et al. (2012) discussed the impact of laminar convective heat transfer in the tube using Al2O3-Cu/water hybrid nanofluid. Here the improvement of gradient of temperature of hybrid nanoliquids compared to base fluid was noticed. Impact of turbulent convective heat transfer using Al2O3-Cu/water hybrid in circular tube was studied by Suresh et al. (2014). Here, we observed that heat transfer of hybrid nanofluids is 8.02 per cent enhanced than that of water-based fluid. Nasrin and Alim (2014) discussed thermal effects of applications of (alumina and copper) double nanoparticles and (alumina) single nano-particle in the waterbased fluid for forced convection by a flat plate solar collector. Their result proved that double nanoparticles had better activity than a single nanoparticle. Rostamian et al. (2017) experimentally showed that the impact of solid volume fraction changes temperature and thermal conductivity of CuO – SWCNTs – EG water. They observed that temperature and solid volume fraction have direct relation with thermal conductivity. Convective flow of silver and copper water nanofluids with thermal radiation is discussed by Hayat et al. (2016). Peristaltic flow of viscoelastic nanoparticle with Hall and ion effects is examined by Hayat et al. (2016). Shao et al. (2017) examined solidification behaviors of hybrid nanofluids containing TiNTs and TiNPs in 10 freeze-melt cycles. The obtained results are also compared to the results ofTiNT andTiNP nanofluids.\nRecently many researchers have studied flow of viscous and non-Newtonian fluids under the influence of magnetic field. It is because of their numerous applications in medical industry. Alfvén (1942) indicated the study of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD). Entropy generation in Sisko fluid flow with non-linear thermal radiation and dissipation is presented by Hayat et al. (2018). Turkyilmazoglu (2018) discussed flow of nanomaterial by using Buongiorno model. Ali et al. (2011) examined the effects of induced magnetic field on MHD boundary layer flow of viscous fluid. Turkyilmazoglu (2017) scrutinized unsteady stagnation point flow of MHD viscous fluid. Kumar and Singh (2013) presented the influence of induced magnetic field on the unsteady hydromagnetic free convection over a semi-finite vertical wall. Impacts of MHD and slip velocity on the stagnation point flow of Jeffrey fluid is discussed by Turkyilmazoglu (2016). Pal and Mandal (2015) explored the impact of thermal radiation on mixed convective boundary layer stagnation point flow towards a stretching surface in porous medium. Some resent results about nanoliquids are presented in Mansor and Zaimi (2014), Mabood and Khan (2014), Hayat et al. (2018), Imtiaz et al. (2017), Khan et al. (2017), Qayyum et al. (2018) and Hayat et al. (2017).\nHaving above view in mind, basic focus of current attempt is to explore non-linear stretched flow of hybrid nanofluid (TiO2 – Cu/water) in four dimensions: First, to model the analysis for induced magnetic field at (TiO2 – Cu/water) nanofluid; second, to study the thermophysical features of hybrid nanofluid for various values of shape factor; third, to address the characteristics of hybrid nanofluid in the region of mixed convective stagnation point; heat transport features are explored through thermal radiation and heat generation/ absorption; and fourth, to construct the series solutions via homotopy analysis method (HAM). Some recent developments in flow of viscous and non-Newtonian materials are listed in Hayat et al. (2016), Hayat et al. (2016), Hsiao (2016), Hayat et al. (2016), Khan et al. (2017), Hsiao (2017), Hayat et al. (2018), Ahmad et al. (2018), Hsiao (2017), Qayyum et al.\nHFF 29,8\n2756\n(2018), Khan et al. (2018), Hsiao (2017), Khan et al. (2018), Hayat et al.

Effect of different physical parameters on the gradient of velocity, induced magnetic field and temperature are analyzed and discussed through graph. Numerical values of skin friction coefficient and gradient of temperature are tabulated and discussed via various physical parameters."

Figures 3-10 disclosed the behaviors of different variables on velocity and induced magnetic field (f'(z ) and g’(z )). In these graphs, the solid lines indicate the characteristics of nanomaterials and dotted lines show the characteristics of hybrid nanomaterials. Effect of (A) on velocity and induced magnetic field (f'(z ) and g'(z )) are plotted in Figures 3-4. Here, we observed two different types of characteristics for different value of (A); a) when A< 1, that is, (Ue < Uw), then the outcome of velocity and induced magnetic field for nanoliquid is less than hybrid nanoliquid. b) When A > 1, that is, (Ue > Uw), then the value of velocity and induced magnetic field for nanoliquid is greater than hybrid nanoliquid. Moreover, no boundary layer exists for A = 0. Impact of volumetric fractions (f 2) (in nanoliquids and hybrid\nFigure 6. f' (z ) via f 2\nFigure 5. f' (z ) via f 2\nFigure 4. g' (z ) via A\nFigure 3. f' (z ) via A\nHFF 29,8\n2762\nnanoliquids) on velocity and induced magnetic field ((f'(z ) and g'(z )) are sketched in\nFigures 5-6. For A < 1, the velocity and induced magnetic field (f'(z ) and g'(z )) decay with higher estimation of volumetric friction (f 2) for both nanoliquids and hybrid nanoliquids. When A > 1, the velocity and induced magnetic field (f'(z ) and g'(z )) are enhanced with volumetric fractions (f 2). Figures 7-8 sketched the behavior of magnetic parameter b on f'(z ) and g'(z ). From these figures, it is observed that f'(z ) and g' (z ) decay via large estimations of b for A < 1 and also for A > 1. Lorentz force is a resistive force which is caused by magnetic field and a retarding force in fluid flow. When magnetic field is applied, resistive force acts to fluid particles, and thus, fluid velocities reduce. Impact of reciprocal magnetic Prandtl number l 1 on f' (z ) and g' (z ) are sketched in Figures 9-10. Here, when A < 1, both velocity and induced magnetic field (f' (z ) and g' (z )) are increased by l 1, and when A > 1, the result are reverse. Figure 11 plotted the impact of mixed convective\nFigure 8. g' (z ) via b\nFigure 9. f' (z ) via l 1\nFigure 10. g' (z ) via l 1\nparameter l on f' (z ). From these figures, it is observed that f' (z ) are enhanced via higher estimation of l for A < 1 and also for A > 1. It is because mixed convection parameter involves buoyancy forces which increases the liquid velocity.\nFigures 12-21 are displayed to examine the impacts of (f 2), (b ), (l 1), (b 1) and (R) on the temperature of nanoliquid and hybrid nanoliquid. Here, three different class of nanoparticles (bricks, cylinders and platelets) are used. The shape factors are 3.7, 4.9 and 5.7.\nFigures 12-13 represent the behavior of volumetric fractions (f 2) on temperature u (z ) for both nanoliquids (Cu-water) and hybrid nanoliquids (TiO2–Cu-water). Clearly, from these figures, the highest temperature is observed when the fluids are hybrid nanoliquids (TiO2– Cu-water) and the nanoparticles are platelets shape. Thermal conductivity nanoparticles enhances by selecting (TiO2–Cu-water and platelets shape of nanoparticle) when compared to nanoliquids (Cu-water) and other two classes of nanoparticles shapes. Figures 14-15\nFigure 12. u (z ) via f 2\nFigure 13. u (z ) via f 2\nFigure 14. u (z ) via b\nFigure 11. f' (z ) via l\nHFF 29,8\n2764\ndisclosed the behavior of (l 1) on temperature u (z ) of nanoliquid (Cu-water) and hybrid nanoliquid (TiO2–Cu-water). It is shown that temperature enhances via l 1 for both fluid. Higher temperature is observed when the fluids are hybrid nanoliquids (TiO2–Cu-water) and the nanoparticles of platelets shape. Physically the reciprocal magnetic Prandtl number is the ratio of viscous diffusion rate to magnetic diffusion rate. Physical higher value\ncorresponds to lower magnetic diffusion rate which consequently increases the nanoliquid temperature. Behavior of magnetic parameter (b ) on u (z ) of (Cu-water) and (TiO2–Cuwater) are investigated in Figures 16-17. It is shown that temperature decays with (b ); such change is greater for hybrid nanoliquids than nanoliquids. Magnetic parameter depends upon the Lorentz force. Hence, the Lorentz force resists the flow that enhances the temperature. Figures 18-19 sketched the effect of heat source (b 1) on temperature of nanoliquids and hybrid nanoliquids. We observed that u (z ) increases through changes in (b 1) for both kinds of fluids. The heat source occurrence contributes additional heat to the liquid that causes a rise in the temperature. Again the changes are smaller for nanoliquids when compared to hybrid nanoliquids. Impact of radiation parameter (R) on nanoliquids and hybrid nanoliquids are investigated in Figures 20-21. Here, u (z ) is enhanced through (R) of two types of fluids (nanoliquids and hybrid nanoliquids). Further changes are smaller for nanoliquids when compared to hybrid nanoliquids. Physically, the mean absorption\nFigure 20. u (z ) via R\nFigure 21. u (z ) via R\nFigure 23. Cfx via l 1\nFigure 22. Cfx via f 2\nHFF 29,8\n2766\ncoefficient is reduced for larger R which causes the radiation amount of heat transfer to liquid rise. Therefore, temperature increases.\nFigures 22-30 highlighted the behaviors of (f 2), (b ), (l 1), (l ), (R) and u w on Cfx andNux. From these figures, we observed that Cfx for nanoliquids (Cu-water) is greater than hybrid nanoliquids (TiO2–Cu-water). Also, we observed that Nux for nanoliquids (Cu-water) is less thanNux hybrid nanoliquids (TiO2–Cu-water).\nTables IV and V show the comparison between the present results of surface drag force and heat transfer rate with the result of previously published study of Ghadikolaei et al. (2017) andMabood et al. (2016) for special cases. From these tables, it is clearly noticed that a good agreement between them.\nFigure 26. Nux via f 2\nFigure 27. Nux via l 1\nTables VI and VII show the behaviors of (f 2), (b ), (l ), (R), (u w) and (l 1) on local skin friction coefficient Cfx and Nusselt number Nux for nanoliquids (Cu-water) and hybrid nanoliquids (TiO2–Cu-water) for different shapes nanoparticles (bricks, cylinders and platelets). From these tables, we observe that for both fluids, that is, (Cu-water andTiO2–Cuwater); the parameters (f 2) (l 1), (b ), (R) and (u w) have a direct relation with Cf but (l ) have a contrast relation with Cfx . Clearly, Nux is an increasing function of (f 2), (l ), (R) and (u w) and it diminishes with (b ) and (l 1). Here, we concluded that nanoparticles having platelets shape is more efficient.\nFigure 30.

Non-linear thermal radiation and heat source/sink are accounted. Flow of hybrid nanofluid is discussed. Non-linear partial differential expressions are converted to ordinary ones through appropriate transformations. Design/methodology/approach – The obtained systems are solved for convergence solutions via homotopy analysis method. Graphical results are discussed for different physical variables on the velocity, induced magnetic field and temperature fields for both Cu water nanofluid and TiO2-Cu-water hybrid nanofluid. Finally, the effect of different physical variables on skin friction coefficient (Cfx) and Nusselt numberNux in the presence of water nanofluid andTiO2-Cu-water hybrid nanofluid are discussed. Findings – Velocities and induced magnetic field are increasing functions of mixed convection parameter and nanoparticle volume fraction. Temperature rises for higher radiation parameter. Skin friction is greater in case of Cu-water nanoliquid, while Nusselt number is less for Cu-water nanofluid when they are compared with hybrid nanoliquidTiO2-Cu-water. Originality/value – No such work is not yet present in the literature.",
