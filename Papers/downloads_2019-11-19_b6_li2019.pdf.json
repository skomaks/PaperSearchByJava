      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Electrochemical water splitting, as one of the most appealing approaches for clean and sustainable hydrogen energy production, has attracted tremendous attention in recent years [1–8]. It generally involves two half-reactions: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the OER processes, requiring certain overpotentials to overcome the kinetic energy barrier to achieve the desired current density, is sluggish, which hampers efficient water splitting [9–11]. Although the state-of-art noble metalbased catalysts, such as iridium and ruthenium oxides, have proven to be efficient and active in OER, the scarcity nature significantly limits their extensive and large-scale applications. Therefore, great efforts have been devoted to earth abundant metal oxide catalysts, such as Fe,\nCo, Ni, and Mn [10,12–15]. Although copper oxide-based materials have not been widely investigated as the others, recent experimental results have suggested that both CuO and Cu2O can be effective in OER as promising catalysts [16–27]. In particular, the low cost and high abundance nature of copper have encouraged researchers on rational design and construction of high-performance copper oxide-based electrocatalysts [28]. To mention but a few recent results, a dendritic nanostructured copper oxide (Cu2O and CuO) electrocatalyst has been synthesized by Huan et al. via a two-step method, including passivation of the conductive copper foam by a copper oxide layer and electrodeposition of CuO nanoparticles [16]. The synthesized samples showed a low overpotential of 290mV at 10mA cm−2 in 1M NaOH solution. Ren et al. reported the in-situ electrochemical conversion of Cu\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2019.123086 Received 8 July 2019; Received in revised form 16 September 2019; Accepted 5 October 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors at: School of Materials Science and Engineering and School of Physics and Electrtonics, Central South University, 410083 Changsha, PR China (W.

An inorganic-MOF-inorganic two-stage precursor approach has been developed by Wu et al. for ultrathin CuO decorated Cu-C hybrid nanorod arrays on carbon fiber cloth, showing an overpotential of 340mV at 10mA cm−2 [18]. A high activity of two-dimensional (2D) CuO self-assembles have been synthesized by Pawar et al. via chemical bath deposition and air annealing treatment with a small Tafel slope of 59mV dec−1 in 1M KOH [19]. Zhang et al. have developed nanostructured CuO/C hollow shell@3D copper dendrites from a metal-organic framework thin layer to provide an extraordinary OER activity in alkaline media [20].\nDespite these efforts, the current methods are still suffering from the complicated fabrication process as well as limited OER catalytic activity of the products. In particular, most of the current methods require hightemperature annealing treatments and long-time hydrothermal reactions, which are complicated, time-, and energy-consuming [16–27]. Moreover, some of the preparation process, such as sulfuration and phosphorization, even involves toxic sulfur/phosphorus-containing gases [29,30]. In addition, the traditional electrodes preparation requires polymer binder to adhere the powder catalysts to conducting substrates, such as Nafion, which often affects the stability of catalysts and reduces the activity due to the formed “dead volume” [31]. Therefore, it is still a challenge job to fabricate stable electrocatalysts with good performance on a large scale in a rapid and simple way. The other issue of Cu oxides as a good electrocatalyst is the intrinsic low electrical conductivity, which will restrict the fast electron transfer within the materials, thus limiting the OER kinetics. To overcome this, a common strategy is to combine the metal oxide catalysts with conductive substrates [32,33].\nIn this sense, surface modification with laser ablation can be an appealing approach to tackle those issues. Laser ablation has been used to synthesize and manufacture metal/metal oxide and intermetallic nanoparticles for superior electrocatalysis [34–37]. It has also been suggested as an effective approach to modify the solid surface with micro/nano-structures, in an ultrafast, simple, non-contact, high efficiency, and easy control way [38–42]. Via laser ablation on Cu foams, Cu oxides are formed on the surface as electrocatalysts, with the metallic Cu core as a highly conductive support, which can readily enhance charge-transfer rate between the catalysts and substrates to improve the catalytic activity. On the other hand, it is known that the catalytic performance of the catalysts not only relies on the conductivity and intrinsic activity of the materials, but also depends on the surface area and the number of active sites. Coincidentally, the laser fabricated rich micro/nano-structures can provide highly specific surface area with a vast number of active sites. Moreover, the laser fabricated micro/nano-structures have proven to possess superhydrophilicity [38,39], which are conducive to the diffusion of water molecules as well as fast mass diffusion and electron transfer [43]. Furthermore, the stable adhesion of formed micro/nano-structures to the Cu foams during the laser ablation process can improve its longterm stability.\nInspired by those, the femtosecond laser ablation is utilized to fabricate Cu oxide micro/nano-structures on copper foam as efficient OER electrocatalysts. The present method is ultrafast, simple, sustainable, and environment-friendly, where the products show superior OER activity with excellent durability."

Detailed information can be found in our previous work [38,39]. For the first scanning process, the laser power, scanning spacing, and speed were set at 8W, 10 μm, and 0.15m/s, respectively. After that, the ablation process was repeated at two different powers (3W, 10 μm, and 3m/s; 6W, 10 μm, and 3m/s). Finally, the laser treated sample was cleaned by ultrasonic cleaner."

      "text" : "To fabricate the samples, the line-by-line femtosecond laser scanning processes were utilized on pristine copper foams (S1). For the firstround scanning, the laser power, scanning spacing and speed were set at 8W, 10 μm, and 0.15m/s, respectively, where the obtained samples were named S2. After that, the laser scanning process was repeated at lower powers (S3: 3W, 10 μm, and 3m/s; S4: 6W, 10 μm, and 3m/s) to avoid damage of the samples. As shown in Fig. 1, after laser ablation, the colour of Cu foam turned from copper reddish orange to dark brown. Fig. 1a-l depicts the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the fabricated samples, which demonstrates the evolution of surface morphology during the laser fabrication. Before the laser ablation, the\nFig. 1. SEM images of the surface morphology for different samples, S1 (a, e, i), S2 (b, f, j), S3 (c, g, k), and S4 (d, h, l).

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\nSEM image indicates a smooth surface of S1 with the intact Cu frameworks within the foam (Fig. 1a, e, i). After the 1st laser scanning process, it is obvious that the surface of S2 is strongly modified with clear roughness (Fig. 1b, f, j), indicating the formation of micro/nanostructures due to the condensation of the laser-induced plasma on the surface. Further ablating the foams with the 2nd laser scanning, more micro/nano-structures appear on the surface (S3 and S4). In particular, porous-like micro/nano-structures are formed on the surface of S4 due to a re-condensation of the laser-ejected plasma or even clusters and nanoparticles on the previously formed micro/nano-structures (see more SEM images in Fig. S1). The significantly increased micro/nanostructures are confirmed by the BET measurements with an increase of BET surface area from 0.15m2/g (S1) to 10.7m2/g (S4). The small cracks for partial of the Cu frameworks can be ascribed to the laser induced heating effects.\nThe formed micro/nano-structures enhance the contact area between the material surface and water due to the capillary effect [47]. Therefore, the surface wettability of the laser treated Cu foam is improved, as demonstrated in Fig. 1m and n for S1 and S4, respectively. The water contact angle (WCA) of the pristine copper foam surface is about 136°, while the WCA of S4 is near 0°, indicating a change from hydrophobic to superhydrophilic after laser ablation. Fig. 1o shows the ultrafast process of a single droplet dropped on the laser treated surface of S4, which is absorbed into the foam within 14ms. The superhydrophilic surface could obviously facilitate the contact and reaction between electrocatalysts and electrolytes during the water splitting process [42,43].\nThe transmission electron microscope (TEM) image (Fig. 2a) demonstrates that the formed micro/nano-structures on the Cu surface are composed of nanoparticles with a mean size of 8.4 nm (Fig. S2). The high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image (see more TEM and HRTEM images in Fig. S3) shows interplanar spacings of 0.246 nm and 0.231 nm of the formed nanoparticles (Fig. 2b), which can be assigned to Cu2O (1 1 1) and CuO (2 0 0) planes, respectively, indicating that the Cu surfaces are strongly oxidized. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) rings (Fig. 2c) confirms that the laser ablated Cu surfaces are composed of Cu2O and CuO. One can see distinct diffraction rings for Cu2O, while only selected patterns for CuO, which suggests abundant Cu2O on the surface, as confirmed by Raman spectra (Fig. S4). This is further verified by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, where a clear Cu2O (1 1 1) peak is found at about 37° (Fig. 2d), while no distinct CuO peak can be identified. In addition, the Cu2O peak increases from S2, over S3, to S4, indicating a further oxidation of the Cu with the 2nd laser scanning. One should also note that the oxidation peak is significantly lower than those of bare Cu due to the restricted oxidization process occurring only on the surface, which thus retains the metallic Cu core with good conductivity. This is confirmed by the ICP-OES results, where a Cu/O mass ratio of 72.3/1 is shown for S4. Moreover, we have carefully tuned the laser parameters, which generally penetrates from a few nm up to μm of the samples. Since the size of copper skeletons in the foams is about 70 μm, much larger than the laser penetration depth, the laser will only ablate the surface layer of the samples.\nThe chemical composition of the laser induced oxidation of the Cu\nFig. 3. (a) LSV curves, (b) Tafel plots, and (c) Fitted electrochemical surface areas of the fabricated samples. (d) Chronopotentiometry curve of sample S4.\nsurface is further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. For pristine Cu foams (S1), the O 1s XPS spectra indicates that the surface is slightly oxidized to CuOx (Fig. 2e). After the laser ablation, clear shoulders appear on both sides, corresponding to the Cu2O and CuO, respectively. It is found that the Cu2O/CuO ratio increases from S2 to S4. This is consistent with the gradual increase of the Cu1+ peak in Cu 2p3/2 spectra as shown in Fig. 2f, with Cu2O/CuO ratio of 0.91, 1.28, and 1.31 for S2, S3, and S4, respectively, which again suggests that the main production is Cu2O during the laser scanning process.\nTo evaluate the OER performance, the fabricated samples were tested in a conventional three-electrode system under 1M KOH condition. Fig. 3a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the prepared samples as well as the commercial RuO2 and Co3O4 for comparison, where the pristine copper foams (S1) exhibit poor OER activity. For the laser fabricated samples, consistent with the increased micro/nano-structures as demonstrated in Fig. 1, they show enhanced OER activities from S2 to S4. With the 1st laser scanning process, S2 shows an overpotential of 387mV at 25mA cm−2, better than the original Cu foam (515mV). The additional modification of the surface by the 2nd laser ablation further increases the amount of micro/nanostructures, thus resulting in better OER performance of S3 and S4. In particular, S4 requires low overpotentials of 310 and 331mV to drive current densities of 25 and 50mA cm−2, respectively, even outperforming the commercial RuO2 (336 and 355mV) and Co3O4 (410mV and 470mV) catalysts. To understand the catalytic kinetics of OER process, Tafel plots of the synthesized samples were also investigated (Fig. 3b). In general, the decreasing tendency of the Tafel slopes of the fabricated samples is consistent with the reducing tendency of the overpotentials. S4 has a small Tafel slope of 63mV dec−1, compared to 78mV dec−1 (S1), 159mV dec−1 (S2), and 240mV dec−1 (S3), as well as 75mV dec−1 and 195mV dec−1 (commercial RuO2 and Co3O4), indicating a sharp increase of the current density with the increasing of overpotential and fast catalytic kinetics. The present OER performance is superior to the reported Cu oxide-based catalysts in alkaline condition, where a more detailed comparison is given in\nTable 1. The enhanced OER performance of the laser fabricated samples is further confirmed by the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) (Fig. 3d), estimated from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves with different scan rates (Fig. S5). From S1 to S4, the ECSA generally increases with the increasing of the micro/nano-structures. S4 possesses a large ECSA of 206.7 mF cm−2, which is about 6.5 times of that of S1. The significantly enhanced ECSA can be attributed to highly specific surface area and the enrichment of the abundant active sites from the laser fabricated rich micro/nano-structures on the surface.\nAside from the OER activity, the durability of Cu based catalysts in alkaline condition has been a critical issue, which severely restricts its widely application. In earlier reports, it has been shown that the OER catalytic activity of the chemically prepared Cu oxides samples declines generally fast after about a few hours of chronopotentiometry test at a current density of 10mA cm−2 in alkaline condition (see Table 1), due to the decay and degradation of the Cu oxides nanostructures [15,48]. Although the CuO/C hollow shell@3D copper dendrites have demonstrated long-term stability for 50 h at 10mA cm−2, it can be ascribed to the incorporation of carbon in the catalysts, which stabilizes Cu oxides electrodes. Nevertheless, chronopotentiometry curve of laser fabricated S4 shows that the potential does not show significant changes after 70 h at a current density of 10mA cm−2, indicating excellent long-term stability. We have carried additional CV cycling to test the long-term stability of the prepared catalysts. As shown in Fig. S6, there is a negligible increase of the overpotential or no degradation after 2000 CV cycling, indicating good durability of the samples. The remarkable stability is further verified by the retained morphology of the micro/ nano-structures on the surface after test (Fig. 4a). The interplanar spacings measured from HRTEM image show that the final products are mainly composed of CuO (Fig. 4b), in line with the SAED patternsTa bl e 1 C om pa ri so n of th e O ER ac ti vi ty in 1 M K O H an d sy nt he si ze d m et ho\nds fr om\nlit er at ur e.\nC at al ys ts\nη at\n25 an\nd 50\nm A cm\n− 2 (m\nV )\nTa fe l sl op\ne (m\nV de\nc− 1 )\nD ur ab\nili ty\nSy nt he\nsi ze d m et ho\nds /t im\ne R ef .\nC u ox\nid es\nm ic ro /n\nan ost ru ct ur es\n31 0,\n33 1\n63 70\nh (1 0 m A cm\n− 2 )\nLa se r ab\nla ti on\n/8 0 s\nTh is\nw or k\nR uO\n2 33\n6, 35\n5 75\nN A\nC om\nm er ci al\nTh is\nw or k\nD en\ndr it ic\nna no\nst ru ct ur ed\nco pp\ner ox\nid e\n35 0,\n42 5\n64 10\nh (1 0 m A cm\n− 2 )\nG al va\nno st at ic\nm et ho\nd +\nan ne\nal in g+\nel ec tr od\nep os it io n/\n> 1. 5 h\n15 *\nC uO\n-T C N Q /C\nF 31\n7, 35\n5 85\n24 h (3 40\nm V )\nV ap\nor -s ol id\nch em\nic al\nre ac ti on\n/ >\n2 h 17 C uO de co ra te d C uC hy br id na no ro d 42 1, 47 0 15 6 10 h (1 0 m A cm − 2 ) A nn ea lin g+ el ec tr od ep os it io n/ > a fe w da ys 18 2D co pp er ox id e 37 4, 39 2 59 10 h (1 0 m A cm − 2 ) C he m ic al ba th de po si ti on + an ne al in g/ > 8 h 19 C uO /C 35 2, 41 0 66 50 h (1 0 m A cm − 2 ) El ec tr od ep os it io n+ so lv ot he rm al m et ho d + he at tr ea tm en t/ > 20 h 20 C op pe r ox id e na no sh ee ts 45 0, 49 6 53 8 h (1 0 m A cm − 2 ) M ol te n sa lt m et ho d/ > a fe w da ys 21\n* El ec tr oc\nat al yt ic\nm ea su re m en\nts w er e ca rr ie d ou\nt in\n1 M\nN aO\nH .\n(Fig. 4c). Those indicate that the laser induced Cu2O-rich micro/nanostructures are further oxidized to CuO during the OER process [15]. This is further verified by the XPS measurements, where a clear decrease of Cu1+ peak and a pronounced increase of Cu2+ peak is found (Fig. 4d). We attribute the improved stability to the stable adhesion of formed Cu oxide micro/nano-structures on the surface of the conducting Cu foam during the laser ablation process. The good long-term stability and the retained OER activity of the laser fabricated samples after the test also suggest that the excellent activity of the fabricated samples can be mainly ascribed to the formed rich micro/nano-structures, while the change of surface composition (from Cu2O-rich to CuOrich) does not show significant influence on the OER performance.\nAnother advantage of the present method is that, compared to the traditional methods, it is ultrafast, non-contact, highly-efficient, and easily controlled, without requiring harsh conditions, e.g. high temperature, high pressure, and long reaction time, etc. It only takes 80 s to prepare a sample (1× 1 cm−2), much faster than the reported results (Table 1). Moreover, it is environment-friendly without any toxic products, which can be easily generalized to other metal systems and has the potential for large-scale manufacturing."

      "text" : "In the present work, femtosecond laser ablation was utilized to modify the Cu foam with rich micro/nano-structures, which are composed of CuO2-riched nanoparticles confirmed by HRTEM, XRD, and XPS. The formed shell (Cu oxide)-core (Cu) structures can readily enhance charge-transfer rate between the catalysts and supports to improve the catalytic activity, while the rich porous-like structures provide highly specific surface area and active sites, and can facilitate the fast-speed diffusion of produced gas bubbles. Moreover, the laser fabricated micro/nano-structures possess superhydrophilicity, which are\nconducive to the diffusion of water molecules as well as fast mass diffusion and electron transfer. Furthermore, the stable adhesion of formed micro/nano-structures to the metal foam during the laser ablation process can be favorable for long-term stability. Therefore, the fabricated samples are supposed to be favorable for oxygen evolution reaction. The electrochemical tests have verified that they show remarkable oxygen evolution activity in 1M KOH with overpotentials of 310 and 331mV at 25 and 50mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 63mV dec−1, and excellent long-term stability.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."

Herein, we report a simple way via femtosecond laser ablation to fabricate Cu oxide micro/nano-structures on Cu foams by fine-tuning of the laser parameters. The present method is ultrafast, non-contact, high efficiency, easy control, sustainable, and environment-friendly. The fabricated catalysts exhibit remarkable OER activity and excellent durability in 1M KOH.",
