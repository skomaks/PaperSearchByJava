      "text" : "Successful cancer treatment is a major element of recent medical practice. Systemic toxicity and the lack of tumor selectivity have hindered many new chemotherapeutic molecules in reaching clinical translation. The way to decrease selective harm in cancer treatment is by actively targeting tumor cells by applicating the anatomical, pathophysiological, and microenvironmental differences between malignant areas and normal bodily tissues [1]. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a linear mucopolysaccharide consisted of alternately repeated N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic di-saccharide, and it makes up a major part of extracellular matrix. HA has hydroxyl and carboxylic groups, as well as an N-acetyl group, which can be used for further chemical modifications. A large variety of cells, such as fibroblasts, synthesize HA [2]. HA shows superior physiochemical natures, such as a high water-binding capacity, nontoxicity, biodegradability, cytocompatibility, and nonimmunogenicity [3]. Due to these biological abilities of HA, there is a great interest in the development of HA-based nanomaterials for diverse biomedical applications, including drug delivery systems (DDS) and molecular imaging. Many cancer cells are known to overexpresses HA-biding receptors, such as CD44, LYVE-1 receptors, and RHAMM [4]. HA is degraded to low molecular weight components by hyaluronidase after being taken up by cancer cells through CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis [5]. CD44, a glycoprotein ubiquitous throughout the body, carries great potential for fulfilling the promise of active targeting. Overexpressed CD44 receptor showed in various cancer cells, including those of colon, ovarian, breast, and squamous carcinoma [6]. HA has been often modified with a drug carrier to improve drug delivery to CD44-overexpressing cancer cells to effectively suppress cancer growth due to its ability to specifically target CD44 [4]. HA is widely used in nanoparticle (NP) formations in experimental studies. NP formulations have attracted\nPolymers 2018, 10, 1133; doi:10.3390/polym10101133 www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2018, 10, 1133 2 of 15\nscientific researchers’ attention because of their ability to take advantage of the enhanced permeability and retention effect for the tumor areas [2,7]. By conjugating an active moiety, such as HA, to the surface of NPs, the cancer cell selectivity can be enhanced through active targeting [8]. In this review, we focus on the recent methodological developments in HA-based nanomaterials to treat tumors. In addition, this review demonstrates nanodelivery systems using HA for encapsulating and targeting active molecules, as well as alternative approaches for targeting CD44 in cancer therapy."

The polyethylene glycols (PEG) are the most commonly used biopolymer to produce biocompatible polymersomes. Polymersomes offer significant advantages over other bilayer vesicles. Compared to liposomes, the advantages of polymersomes are high membrane stability and low membrane permeability, resulting from varying the block lengths [30–32].\nFigure 2.

      "heading" : "3. Degradation of HA",
      "text" : "HA is catalyzed by two main processes: enzymatic and non-enzymatic. Enzymatic degradation of HA-based nanomaterials is catalyzed by hyaluronidase in biological environments. HA is primarily degraded through enzymatic processes that hydrolyze the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds. This process occurs through the action of three enzymes. Hyaluronidase cleaves high molecular weight HA into smaller oligosaccharides. Next, β-D-glucuronidase and β-M-acetyl-hexosaminidase further degrade the oligosaccharide fragments [46,47]. These enzymes broadly distribute in the body tissues and operate in wide range of pH [48]. Catalase inhibits the degradation of HA macromolecules in a dose-dependent manner, which possibly makes H2O2 in the reaction system [49]. A non-enzymatic degradation process for HA has been reported in the presence of reactive oxygen species [50]. The resulting products considerably differ from the parent HA, while the products originating from the enzymatic degradation constitute parent HA-chains of smaller molecular weights [51]. Following an intravenous injection, HA, which has a half-life of 3–6 min, is rapidly removed from the blood circulation. Using labeled HA, it was determined that the liver and spleen are the main pathways for HA removal, with as much as 88% of injected HA absorbed by the liver. Thus, the primary and rapid clearance pathway for HA is through the liver [52]. Renal clearance of HA occurs as only 1% of the normal daily turnover of HA [47]."

The use of HA-based nanomaterials is a commonly used DDS for chemotherapeutic agents. Nanomaterials enhance the overall pharmacological properties of widely used hydrophobic anticancer drugs, such as PTX, DOX, and irinotecan (IRT), as shown in Table 1.\nPolymers 2018, 10, 1133 6 of 15\nCovalent conjugation with HA could produce the selective delivery of PTX to tumor cells. Several chemical strategies produce various HA-PTX nanomaterials with different chemical linkages and this nanomaterial has various performances [22]. HA solubilization method in a single organic phase is a chemical conjugation process of HA and PTX (HA-PTX). HA-PTX conjugate showed a greater inhibition effect on CD44-overexpressing cancer cells than that for normal cells [54]. Cai et al. [55] showed HA-DOX nanoconjugates. These nanoconjugates had a lasting release feature in the rodent breast cancer models and reduced cardiac toxicity and showed minimal toxic effects in healthy tissue. Finally, the conjugates inhibited breast cancer progression in rodent breast cancer models and showed good anticancer effect. Several reports showed that the micelles have great drug-loading capacities for hydrophobic chemotherapeutic agents [56,57]. The PTX-loaded micelle was successfully synthesized based on redox-sensitive HA-deoxycholic acid (HA-ss-DOCA) conjugates, as shown in Figure 4. These micelles had effective intracellular anticancer drug delivery systems of lipophilic drugs and could significantly increase their accumulation in the tumor site [57]. Our group [56] synthesized PTX-loaded HA micelles targeting CD44-overexpressing cancer cells (SCC7 cells). PTX-loaded micelle labeled with NIR dyes were injected into SCC7 cancer mice model for theranostic test. PTX-loaded HA micelles have potential as a specific anticancer treatment effect for SCC5 cancer cells. Choi et al. [58] synthesized PEG-conjugated HA micelle (PEG-HA) and encapsulated the IRT into the hydrophobic cores of the PEG-HA micelle. Due to their remarkable tumor-targeting ability, IRT-loaded micelle showed great antitumor activity while reducing undesirable side effects. Paliwal et al. [59] reported the synthesis of HA-based pH-sensitive (pH-HA) polymersomes. pH-HA polymersomes had characteristics of pH dependent DOX release that was significantly increased at pH of ~5 compared with a physiological pH ~7.4. The antitumor efficacy of these polymersomes was proven in CD44 receptor expressing MCF-7 cells. pH-sensitive HA-based polymersomes were significantly more effective than the non-targeted polymersomes in MCF-7 cells. PTX-loaded HA hydrogel was tested as a carrier of PTX for the intraperitoneal drug delivery to the intraperitoneal ovarian cancer model. When administered to tumor-bearing nude mice, PTX hydrogel showed relatively good retention in the intraperitoneal cavity of mice model rather than PTX gel after intravenous injection. However, PTX hydrogel did not reduce the tumor volume more than PTX, presumably due to the limited dissolution of PTX [60].\nPolymers 2018, 10, 1133 7 of 15 Polymers 2018, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 14\nPTX-loaded HA hydrogel was tested as a carrier of PTX for the intraperitoneal drug delivery to the intraperitoneal ovarian cancer model.

They demonstrated that PTX-loaded HA-MSN NPs increased the accumulation of PTX in breast cancer cells via CD44-mediated endocytosis and showed great anticancer effect in vitro. The HA-MSN NPs possessed a preferable anticancer ability and exhibited not only minimal toxic side effects but a strong cancer suppression potential of PTX as well. Another researcher reported HA-DOX NPs conjugated by an acid-labile hydrazone linkage. Due to specific biological cognition of HA, these NPs have the feature of good water solubility, and specific accumulation in human hepatoma model (HepG2 cells). In addition, the cumulative release of DOX from these NPs was significantly increased at acidic pH of 5.0–6.0 compared with its release at the physiological pH of 7.4. The HA-DOX conjugate might be effective chemotherapy against hepatoma [62].\n4.2.

HA has the potential as a cancer therapy system of immunotherapy. Conjugates consisting of HA and ovalbumin (OVA) as a foreign antigen was tested. When nanomaterials treated with CD44 expressing murine cervical cancer cells, it effectively internalized and enabled display of the antigenic OVA peptide on the cell surface. HA-OVA effectively accumulated into the mouse tumor model after its systemic intravenous injection [71]. Another group synthesized matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9)-responsive nanomaterials consisting of PEGylated HA and OVA peptide. This nanosystem in the presence of MMP-9 entered to the murine cervical cancer cell line by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The nanomaterials systemically administered to tumor-bearing mice with endogenous OVA-specific cytotoxic T cells demonstrated the inhibition of cancer growth [72].\nPolymers 2018, 10, 1133 9 of 15\nXu et al. [69] synthesized lipid-calcium-phosphate (LCP) and liposome-protamine-HA (LPH) polymersomes. Effective immunoresponses against self/cancer antigens and great therapeutic results against advanced cancer are major challenges in cancer immunotherapy. LCP vaccine nanomaterials delivered both a tumor antigen and adjuvant to dendritic cells and promoted a systemic immune response regardless of the stage of host cancer. LPH NPs loaded siRNA made a 50% knockdown of TGF-β in the late-stage tumor microenvironment. Combination of LCP and LPH nanomaterials might be a powerful platform for cancer immunotherapy compared with vaccine treatment alone. Immunotherapy of interferon-alpha (IFN-α) is used for treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The synergistic effect of IFN-α-incorporated HA hydrogels plus sorafenib in a mouse model is reported. HA hydrogels most effectively inhibited tumor growth in nude mice having human RCC xenografts. In addition, these nanomaterials suppressed the proliferation of RCC cells by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis [73]. Shin et al. [74] synthesized HA-based combination vaccine adjuvants including hydrophobic monophosphoryl lipid, QS21, and imiquimod (R837). The immunostimulatory effects of HA-based vaccine adjuvants were effective in the restriction of tumor cell proliferation in a mouse lymphoma expressing OVA mouse model. This nanomaterial combined with vaccine adjuvants may be used as a potent cancer therapeutic vaccine."

As HA has several functional parts that replace, there is potential for the conjugation of more than one therapeutic agent to HA, and it may make a combination therapy, as shown in Table 4. One report showed the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy to treat breast cancer using a dual pH-responsive nanomaterial system. Conjugates based on poly(L-histidine) and HA were designed for co-loading R848 and DOX and showed great tumor targeting, and significantly suppressed the 4T1 tumor growth by regulation of immunity and killing effect on tumor cells [76]. The combination therapy of chemotherapy and PDT is increased the therapeutic efficacy in treating cancer. HA-ceramide micelle encapsulating both a photosensitizer and anticancer drug efficiently enhanced PDT effect in a lung cancer model. Developed micelles are introduced as a good DDS in PDT [77].\nPolymers 2018, 10, 1133 10 of 15\nNanoplatform self-assembled from HA-PTX prodrug and marimastat (MATT)-loaded thermosensitive polymersome is synthesized for the dual targeting of the cancer cells and TME. This polymersome rapidly released their payloads into the extracellular environment, and the released HA-PTX entered 4T1 cells through the CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis. This nanomaterial can be self-assembled into a smart polymersome and are effective treatment nanocarriers. The co-delivery of MATT and HA-PTX is a good therapeutic option of metastatic cancer [78]. Deng et al. [79] synthesized miR-34a, a potent endogenous breast cancer tumor-suppressive molecule, co-encapsulated with DOX into HA-chitosan (CS) hydrogels for targeting breast cancer cells. HA-CS NPs co-loaded miR-34a and DOX could have a synergistic anticancer effect by suppressing the oncogene and enhancing the antitumor effects of DOX on cancer cells. Combined chemotherapy and PTT provides new therapeutic drug delivery carriers for synergistic cancer therapy. Combination of light-responsive GO, DOX, and pH-sensitive disulfide-bond linked HA form a nano-sized hydrogel. The nanogel showed excellent photoluminescence properties and good stability in buffer and serum solutions. The GO-DOX-HA hydrogel might be a very effective DDS with inhibition of human lung cancer cells and a decreased toxic effect on healthy cells [80]. Wang et al. [81] reported a multi-stimuli responsive nanoplatform based on DOX loaded gold (Au) nanocages of HA for targeted intracellular drug release. DOX-AuNCs-HA could specifically target cancer cells via CD44 endocytosis. DOX-AuNCs-HA could release encapsulated DOX and induce a higher therapeutic efficacy upon NIR irradiation and reduce the toxic effects."

      "text" : "HA-based nanomaterials can target and enter cells more efficiently through the HA receptormediated endocytosis pathway. HA provides a simple and attractive approach for the active targeting of tumor cells with minimal toxicity. HA nanomaterials are attractive systems for the effective delivery of antitumor agents. Much research has demonstrated the ability of HA to target CD44-overexpressing cancer cells. Interestingly, HA can easily be chemically modified and used as a target-specific DDS or in various carrier systems for cancer therapy. The advancement of nanomedicine has offered new and promising solutions and insights for the prevention and theranostic option of cancer. HA-based nanomaterials might give new opportunities for the widespread use of biomedical applications. As research in HA nanomaterials progresses, we expect more innovative strategies for expanding their biomedical applications. HA-based nanomaterials show great promise for future biomedical applications in cancer therapy.\nPolymers 2018, 10, 1133 11 of 15\nFunding: This research was supported by the Bio & Medical Technology Development Program of the NRF funded by the Korean government, MSIP (NRF-2017M3A9E2056374).\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."
