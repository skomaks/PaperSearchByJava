      "text" : "The field of synthetic biology applies engineering concepts and principles to the design and generation of new biological components, circuits, and organisms. One tenet of the field has been to generate a suite of well-characterized, robust, and highly reliable biological parts to rationally construct new biological functions and systems (1, 2). Crucially, the generation and characterization of biosensors to measure, analyze, and control cellular functions has enabled assembly of complex genetic circuits (3) and biosynthetic pathways in organisms (4-7), development of diagnostic tools and therapeutics (8, 9), and sensors for industrial applications (10). Though exciting, the extensive, systems-specific engineering and optimization required for many of these functionalities and applications has thus far meant that many biosensors remain useful only in their systems of original design and optimization (11, 12).\nComprised of both sensor and reporter domain elements, biosensors recognize an input signal and generate an output for either detection or driving a cellular change. Various underlying biomolecular scaffolds, usually first identified and characterized in natural systems, have been\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan us\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 2\nutilized (e.g., RNA, transcription factors, proteins, and enzymes), forming a diverse set of sensors capable of detecting a broad array of inputs, from small molecules to proteins, and even light, to yield an equally varied set of readout/output signals, such as fluorescence, luminescence, gene expression, and enzymatic activity (13-16). Rational, informed design of novel, synthetic biosensors requires significant effort in first characterizing and then optimizing properties that affect overall performance, such as the output dynamic range, input specificity and sensitivity, and reliable, orthogonal utility in different conditions and genetic contexts (Box 1). This last point is especially important when considering porting biosensors between original and target systems (17, 18). Recent innovations in modular design (i.e., ‘plug-and-play’ approaches to building biosensors), random and targeted mutagenesis, screening-based selection, directed evolution technologies (19), and antibody mimetics (20) have each partially ameliorated design, development, and optimization phases for individual biosensors. These improvements, and others, will be reviewed in detail in the context of different biosensor protein scaffolds. However, to illustrate the demands involved in biosensor generation, we will first briefly examine two classic, highly-reviewed biosensor systems: transcription factor (TF)-based biosensors and riboswitches (Fig. 1).\nAlthough available since the 1950s (21), biosensor technologies have only relatively recently made the leap from electronic to biological parts. Small molecule-inducible microbial promoters quickly emerged as relatively straight-forward biomolecular options that were readily harnessed for biosensing applications. TF-based biosensors utilize naturally evolved TFs to either activate or repress reporter gene expression (13). Identified via genome mining, TF/promoter pairs or repressor/operator pairs typically respond to small molecules or metabolites (e.g., arabinose, IPTG, anhydrotetracycline, acrylate, glucarate, erythromycin, naringenin, etc. (17, 22)) to modulate transcriptional activity (Fig. 1A). Newer, synthetic TF biosensor designs involve engineering and linking together ligand sensing and DNA binding domains to alternately recruit transcriptional machinery or block transcription based on the presence and absence of input signal, respectively (23-25). More complex systems involve integrating transcription factors into biosynthetic pathways to help regulate and increase the production of metabolites (26). This reliance on the system’s transcriptional machinery, however, denotes a major limiting factor in the design of TF-based biosensors. Transcriptomic methods can and have been used to help identify ligand-responsive transcriptional elements (27-29), but their finite system-wide diversity can present challenges for specificity (13). Transference of transcriptional elements between heterologous systems also tends to be unreliable, due to unforeseen losses in efficiency in nonnative systems (13, 30). Despite this, TF-based biosensors are widely used, and have found utility\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 3\nin detecting metabolite production in biosynthetic pathways and organisms via high-throughput screening (HTS) techniques, such as fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS) (31, 32). For a more extensive look at TF-based biosensors, see the following recent reviews: (13, 31).\nComposed entirely of RNA, genetically-encoded riboswitches, or RNA switches, are typically divided into aptamer and expression platform segments and allosterically inform reporter gene expression (Fig. 1B). The unique biophysical properties of RNA enable binding of the aptamer portion to its cognate ligand, typically a small molecule, which induces a conformational change in the expression platform to modulate a genetic response, (e.g., translational initiation, translational termination, or transcript decay via ribozymatic self-cleavage) (33). Although naturally-occurring, any number of predictive secondary structure or biophysical property algorithms can be used to rationally design synthetic riboswitches de novo (34-38). In addition, evolution of aptamers from selection-based platforms, such as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) (19, 39, 40), and annotated repositories of known RNA aptamer, riboswitch, and ribozyme sequence libraries (for example: https://www.aptagen.com/aptamerindex) have facilitated generation of novel riboswitches (41, 42). Their deceptively simple design (i.e., aptamer and expression platform sequences tethered with a flexible linker sequence) belies the extensive effort required for designing and synthesizing a riboswitch with the correct desired functionality. For example, while directed evolution strategies, such as phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), can be harnessed to tune the dynamic range of an existing riboswitch, they have yet to be used to successfully alter ligand specificity (43). A recent comprehensive rational design strategy further elucidates the different considerations and optimization steps needed to generate a functional riboswitch (44). Nevertheless, HTS and FACS approaches (45-51) have contributed to an increasing speed of synthetic RNA switch design and development. For a more extensive review of riboswitches, see: (15, 31, 52).\nDue to the utility of biosensors to sense, report on, and impact biology in response to endogenous and exogenous signals, there is growing demand across many different fields for novel biosensors with improved performance. Highly reliable, tailored biosensors are positioned to greatly facilitate the generation of novel genetic circuits and engineered organisms for drug and metabolite production, clinical diagnostics and therapies, and other translational applications, such as cell free systems (53) and cell sentinels (8). This review will focus on several new biosensor protein scaffolds, detailing each of their distinctive reporting capabilities and utility, as well as novel iterations on their basic design and functional applications in target analyte detection and synthetic biology. First, we will briefly introduce protein fragment complementation assay (PCA)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep ed\nM an\nus cr\nip t\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 4\nbased biosensors, highlighting more recent PCA designs such as split protease and split esterase enzymes. Then we will introduce multiple biosensors inspired by native biological enzymes: 1) the T7 RNAP polymerase, which drives a transcription-based output; 2) cell surface receptors, such as GPCRs, which detect metabolites and produce a protein signaling-based output; and 3) CRISPR-Cas enzymes, which can uniquely target specific genetic loci and generate a gene expression-based output. For each of the listed biosensors, we will describe both the design and engineering efforts to harness these native proteins for use as biosensors; with an emphasis on their integration into engineered signaling pathways or synthetic gene circuits to both detect and impact underlying systems based on specific inputs. Finally, we will introduce biosensors inspired by the capability of microbiome populations to sense underling biological environments and elicit a measured response. For microbiome-based biosensors, recent advances in the design of gene circuits and components will be highlighted. We conclude with a brief overview of the discussed biosensors, underscoring their continuing incorporation into various synthetic biology applications."

      "text" : "Split reporters are routinely used to monitor biological interactions and assembly processes. For example, split RNA aptamer systems have been utilized to observe cleavage of RNA ribozymes in vitro (54), RNA transcription and hybridization in vitro (55), and RNA-RNA interactions in vivo (56). Analogous protein fragment complementation assays (PCAs) are routinely used to measure protein-protein interactions (PPIs) through the use of split reporters (57), reviewed in: (58-60). Complementary split reporters are fused to interacting proteins that direct assembly of the reporter to generate an output signal (Table 1). For example, split fluorescent proteins and luciferases are used to detect PPIs through the generation of fluorescence and photons, respectively. Importantly, these tools enable numerous applications beyond PPI analysis, including HTS of PPI inhibitors, detection of protein biomarkers, monitoring changes in protein conformation, and assessment of protein solubility (61-64). Due to their broad utility, developmental engineering of new split luciferase and fluorescent protein systems are routinely conducted (65-68). In addition to measuring PPIs, new split enzymatic systems with biotin ligase and ascorbate peroxidase have enabled profiling and identification of PPIs and RNAprotein interactions (69-71).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 5\nSplit proteases, such as tobacco etch virus (TEV) are also regularly utilized to monitor PPIs. Reassembly of split TEV can either proteolytically cleave and release TFs for reporter gene expression, or proteolytically activate an inactive reporter protein (72, 73). Split proteases have also become important components of engineered gene circuits in synthetic biology (74-76). For example, the Wells group developed an approach to activate individual procaspases with high selective activity through the use of split TEV (77). This approach required reengineering the previously reported split TEV to reduce the affinity of the TEV fragments for spontaneous reassembly, as this was problematic to studying apoptosis. Fusion of the newly engineered split TEV to rapamycin-dependent dimerization domains endowed small molecule control over proteolysis. When used in combination with caspase alleles encoding the TEV cleavage site, this allowed selective activation of individual caspases. This strategy was not only used to identify the specific caspases responsible for apoptosis, but also analysis of broad proteomic changes and identification of caspase-susceptible subunits of the proteasome, which together suggested a model of proteolytic reciprocal negative regulation.\nMore recently, Jerala and colleagues developed a panel of split proteases, fused with\northogonally dimerizing coiled coils (CC), that recognize specific cleavage sites to model Boolean logic functions and signaling pathways in mammalian cells (75). This platform utilized an approach requiring selective enzyme-substrate pairings, in which masked small molecules, otherwise inactive in the normal cellular milieu, were selectively unmasked by the activity of the exogenous reporter. A similar approach from the Elowitz group utilizes degrons fused to output reporters via a protease cleavage site, creating protease-repressible and -activatable platforms in which the degron is exposed or removed resulting in degradation or stabilization of the reporter (78). To regulate the protease that controls the degron/reporter platform, they split the protease such that enzyme complementation was dependent upon an additional, separate protease. This proteaseregulated protease was interfaced with Boolean logic gates for multiple inputs and specific outputs.\nAside from protease-based molecular unmasking, small molecules have also been\ngenerated by orthogonal cellular machinery. For example, Lavis et al. showed that 1- methylcyclopropyl (CM2)-masked phenol esters are not processed and unmasked by any endogenous human esterase, but are efficiently unmasked by a specific exogenous esterase, porcine liver esterase (PLE) (76). Therefore, expression of PLE can be used to selectively unmask molecules using these selective enzyme-substrate pairs. PLE and other orthogonal enzymesubstrate pairs have subsequently been employed for in vivo imaging studies (79-81), cell type-\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep t\nM an\nus ip\nt\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 6\nspecific pharmacology (76, 82, 83), imaging cellular interactions (84), and small moleculemediated activation of intracellular signaling pathways (85)."

      "text" : "The ability to selectively unmask small molecules in live cells using orthogonal enzyme-\nsubstrate pairs is a powerful method to generate both imaging agents and bioactive molecules in defined cell populations. We reasoned that these systems may also be amenable to the creation of biosensor platforms by splitting the enzymes and engineering them to be proximity-dependent, and therefore activated only when fused sensing domains drive enzyme assembly to catalyze the unmasking of small molecule substrates. While it is possible to use a split β-lactamase (86) in\nconjugation with β-lactam prodrugs, this has not yet been successfully demonstrated (87).\nInstead, we envisioned using a selective esterase-ester pair for this strategy. Exogenous esterases have previously been expressed in mammalian cells for prodrug metabolism (88), analysis of calcium signaling (89), and neuronal imaging (76). In addition, ester masking strategies for a variety of functional groups are well established (76, 90-93).\nTo demonstrate this concept, we recently engineered a split microbial BS2 esterase\ncapable of detecting PPIs via interaction-dependent unmasking of α-cyclopropyl esters on model small molecules (Fig. 2A) (94). We used the aforementioned fluorescein α-cyclopropyl ester (fluorescein-CM2) to screen for PPI-dependent esterase cut sites. The rapamycin dimerization domains FRB and FKBP were fused to each fragment, co-expressed in E. coli, and screened with and without rapamycin in the presence of fluorescein-CM2. We identified two cut sites with similar enzymatic activity on fluorescein-CM2 and transitioned our lead cut site (amino acid 94) into mammalian cells. The resulting split esterase reporter detected multiple types of PPIs, including leucine zipper peptides, small molecule-induced dimerization domains, and biologically-relevant PPIs in mammalian cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, we established that split BS2 can measure timedependent engagement of small molecule PPI inhibitors in live cells.\nTo demonstrate additional imaging modalities of small molecule uncaging, we developed\na methylcyclopropyl ester-masked pro-chemiluminescent probe (67, 95, 96). By interfacing this probe with an extracellular split BS2 system, we detected dimerization of transmembrane cellsurface receptors, an essential component of synthetic cell-surface biosensors (Fig. 2C). In addition, this split reporter system showed potential for multiplexing capabilities enabling the simultaneous detection of extracellular PPIs with split BS2 and intracellular PPIs with split Nanoluc.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 7\nBeyond producing fluorescent and chemiluminescent signal outputs, our extracellular split\nBS2 platform can be combined with ester-protected pharmacologics for controlled cellular cytotoxicity. We showed that, in the presence of rapamycin, dimerization of split extracellular BS2 unmasks the caged cytotoxic SN-38-CM2 to induce cell death (Fig. 2D). This system can also be utilized for intercellular cell killing in which split esterase-expressing cells can mediate cell death in a neighboring cell population. Collectively, the small molecule output of split BS2 PPI-detection enables fluorescent, chemiluminescent, and pharmacological signal generation that should be easily extended to other caged small molecules (94)."

      "text" : "A key characteristic of a broadly useful biosensor is the production of a tractable and\nversatile output. RNA is a particularly appealing biosensor output, owing to its capacity for information storage and utility in both gene expression and knockdown applications. Indeed, one of the reasons TF-based biosensors have gained such widespread use is the versatility of driving any RNA sequence output. However, engineering TFs to respond to diverse input signals has proven challenging, and generally only subtle alterations to the native sensing scope of any given TF system have been achieved.\nIn this section, we review the development and progression in the use of the small (~100\nkDa) single-subunit T7 bacteriophage RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) as a biosensing platform. The highly-specific T7 RNAP drives expression only from its cognate T7 promoter (PT7), making it orthogonal to native E. coli and eukaryotic promoters and polymerases (97, 98). Taken together with the enzyme’s strong transcriptional activity (98), this ultimately results in a high signal-tonoise ratio. T7 RNAP has long been used as a robust transcriptional system in a variety of in vitro and in vivo molecular biology and synthetic biology applications (99). Interestingly, a split version of the T7 RNAP was identified during early purification efforts (100). Separately, the two fragments possess no transcriptional activity, but it is restored upon reassembly (101-103). Recent strategies to modulate the biosensing utility of the T7 RNAP platform have capitalized on this phenomenon, resulting in the design of customized, biochemical-dependent assembly of the nonactive fragments. Both full-length and split T7 RNAP are attractive starting points for the development of RNAP-based biosensors in both cellular and synthetic biology contexts.\nDeveloping the full-length T7 RNA polymerase into tractable biosensors.\nMultiple crystal structure studies have informed upon the structure-function relationship of\nT7 RNAP (104-111), reviewed in: (112, 113), enabling the design of T7 and PT7 variants with\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan sc\nrip t\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 8\nimproved functionality (discussed with regard to split T7, below), context-specific activation, and even multiplexing capabilities. For example, Deiters and colleagues developed a spatiotemporally-controlled T7 RNAP optogenetic sensor by incorporating a photocaged amino acid into the active site of full-length T7 RNAP, inhibiting its transcriptional activity pending exposure to UV light (114). Another example of a context-constrained T7 RNAP biosensor is the protease-responsive T7 RNAP (PR), developed in our laboratory by tethering a known T7 RNAP inhibitor, T7 lysozyme (115), to the full-length polymerase via a linker region containing a protease cut site (116). Transcriptional activity of the PR is restored only when the required protease is present and cleaves the linker region. In the same study, we generated a series of orthogonal PR/promoter pair variants using the directed evolution platform, PACE. This panel of PRs, each with unique protease cut sites, are able to simultaneously inform on the presence and activity of multiple proteases in the same cells. Additional possibilities for multiplexed RNAP biosensors have been explored via targeted mutagenesis of the amino acids responsible for promoter recognition (107), determination of the minimal consensus sequence for transcription initiation (117), selection based platforms, and directed evolution strategies to produce orthogonal RNAP/promoter pairs, thus generating multiple biosensors from the same basic platform to report in response to different cellular events (118-121).\nSplit T7 RNAP as orthogonal transcriptional controllers\nDue in large part to its orthogonality, the T7 RNAP platform has proven to be a useful\nfoundation in the creation of biological logic gates, the building blocks used to assemble gene circuits in synthetic biology (comprehensively reviewed in: (99)). In particular, split T7 RNAP recently emerged as a valuable tool in the design of synthetic transcriptional ‘AND’ logic gates, which enable circuit designs that rely on the integration of two input signals for a T7 RNAP-driven transcriptional output. Utilization of differentially inducible promoters to separately drive the expression of each T7 RNAP fragment, produced a simple ‘AND’ gate, wherein only the concurrent presence of two small molecule inducers (arabinose and IPTG) results in expression of both T7 RNAP fragments, which self-assemble to drive expression of a PT7-controlled fluorescent reporter in vivo (122, 123). In the same study, Shis and Bennet (123) went on to construct a library of orthogonal split T7 RNAP/PT7 variant pairs, enabling the construction of increasingly complex gene circuits. Interestingly, comparison of inducible full-length and split T7 RNAP-driven transcription revealed an unexpected increase in the tolerance of the split platform to high inducer concentrations, as compared with the full-length platform (123). The resultant stability and saturation of the fluorescent reporter, the authors argue, may be beneficial traits from\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan sc\nrip t\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 9\na synthetic biology standpoint. Indeed, while not directly cytotoxic, the eight-fold more rapid transcriptional activity of T7 RNAP over host E. coli RNAP is thought to contribute to host cell growth defects that occur when expressed off a strong promoter (124).\nEmulating complex genetic systems, Voigt and colleagues further split the T7 RNAP\nsystem into orthogonal controller (PT7 recognition domain variants of T7), two-part resource allocator (T7 core domain), and actuator (PT7-controlled reporter gene) elements, thereby creating a tunable biosensor platform and allowing incorporation of multiple RNAP biosensors into a single host without detrimental effects (125). Competition of the orthogonal controllers for a variable pool of transcription-ready resource allocators results in actuator expression proportional to the level of each controller (125). Recent advancements upon this platform include the development of light-sensitive optogenetic RNAP biosensors to generate pigments, fluorescent proteins, and CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene knockdown (126), and production of split T7 RNAP variants with large dynamic ranges integrated with a three-color synthetic circuit to model hierarchical gene expression (127). Split T7 RNAP-based gene circuits will likely continue to find utility in a range of synthetic biology applications due to the versatility, orthogonality, and multidimensionality enabled by the robust T7 RNAP enzyme.\nGeneration of proximity-dependent split T7 RNAPs\nThe aforementioned applications of split T7 RNAP took advantage of the spontaneous\nassembly of the split T7 RNAP fragments to form a functional enzyme. However, Voigt and colleagues noted that fusing the split T7 RNAP fragments to additional binding domains enhanced the RNA output activity of the system (125), suggesting that the split T7 RNAP template could be used as a new PCA biosensor. As described above, various proteins have been split and engineered into proximity-dependent sensors for analysis purposes, including fluorescent proteins (128), luciferases (129), and horseradish peroxidase (130). We reasoned that a split RNAP could serve as a versatile biosensor scaffold for synthetic biology purposes by creating an output signal (i.e., RNA) capable of interacting with the cellular machinery in a variety of ways. The utility of PCA systems is dictated by the dynamic range of the split reporter, whereby background assembly in the absence of an input signal is low, and assembly driven by pendant fusion domains results in robust activation. The efficient, spontaneous assembly of split T7 RNAP fragments confers a very high “background” signal, precluding their utility as PCA biosensors. To address this limitation, we initiated a program to engineer “proximity-dependent” split T7 RNAPs as a new PCA-based approach for generating robust biosensors that encode molecular interactions in RNA outputs (Fig. 3A).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep e\nM an\nus c\nip t\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 10\nT7 RNAP undergoes dramatic structural rearrangements as it transitions from\ntranscription initiation to elongation (104-111), reviewed in: (112, 113), presenting a challenge to rationally engineering the split T7 RNAP fragments into proximity-dependent sensors. Indeed, despite substantial effort using structure-guided mutational design and screening, we were unable to engineer split T7 RNAP fragments that had a greater than ~10-fold dynamic range, based on pendant interactions. Therefore, we decided to employ directed evolution approaches to select for proximity dependency in one fragment of the split T7 RNAP, reasoning that unbiased rapid evolution would be capable of solving this challenging biophysical problem. We developed a PACE-based evolution strategy that simultaneously selects for preserved T7 RNAP activity in the presence of the pendant interactions driving the assembly, while also selecting against T7 RNAP assembly in the absence of proximity-dependent interactions. Briefly, PACE involves linking the life cycle of M13 bacteriophage to new functions of a gene product encoded in the phage genome, such that the phage simply replicates until the desired activity emerges through natural evolutionary processes. The advantage of PACE is the ability to very quickly screen large populations in an unbiased manner, which directly benefits this particular evolution of split T7 RNAP fragments, as the precise mutations that would be required to endow the protein with proximity dependence were challenging to predict.\nTo develop a PACE workflow for split T7 RNAP, we cloned the N-terminal half of T7 RNAP\nsplit at position 180 (RNAPN) fused to a zipper peptide (ZA) into the M13 genome, replacing gIII, a required phage gene. We then engineered two Accessory Plasmids (APs) in E. coli host cells. One plasmid expresses both an evolved C-terminal split T7 RNAP variant engineered to act on the CGG promoter (CGG-RNAPC) instead of PT7, and a CGG promoter-driven gIII. The second plasmid expresses wild-type C-terminal split T7 RNAP (T7-RNAPC), and PT7-driven gIIIneg, a dominant negative form of gIII that lowers phage fitness (131). The CGG-RNAPC is fused to a second zipper peptide (ZB), which interacts with ZA, while the T7-RNAPC is fused to a mutated, non-ZA binding form of ZB (ZBneg). Under these conditions, phage infect an E. coli host cell, produce an evolved variant of the ZA-fused RNAPN fragment, which then either preferentially assembles with the ZB-fused CGG-RNAPC fragment (i.e., the desired interaction), or assembles with both the ZB-fused CGG-RNAPC and the ZBneg-fused T7-RNAPC fragments (i.e., an undesired interaction). The fitness of the phage is therefore dictated by the ability of the evolving RNAPN fragment to assemble in a proximity-dependent manner (132, 133).\nDuring early rounds of evolution, the RNAPN assembled roughly equally well with both\nRNAPC fragments. Therefore, we maintained weak negative selection pressure early in the evolution by controlling copy number and promoter strength on the APs.

After 29 days of PACE, we identified T7 RNAP variants that possessed a 350-fold dynamic range in the presence of a set of interacting partners, as compared with non-fused controls. Interestingly, most of the activity of the split T7 RNAP fragment was maintained, but the background spontaneous activity was lowered by roughly two orders of magnitude. In follow-up work, we were able to further lower background by another order of magnitude using additional evolution, resulting in split biosensors with >2,000-fold dynamic range (Fig. 3B) (134).\nCritically, because we evolved the split T7 RNAP fragments using long, flexible linkers\nthat tethered the interaction partners to the split protein system, the resultant split enzyme has minimal dependence on either linker length or orientation of fused binding domains. Therefore, with minimal effort, we were able to simply ‘plug-and-play’ various fusion proteins onto the two halves of the evolved split T7 RNAP to create an assortment of biosensors. Aside from detecting leucine zipper peptide interactions (135), we were able to detect small molecule inputs like rapamycin (via fusions to FRB and FKBP (136); Fig. 3C) and abscisic acid (via fusions to ABI and PYL (137)), and light (via the iLID system (138)) (132, 134). Others have subsequently fused split T7 RNAPs to other light-inducible interacting domains to generate additional optogenetic sensors (139, 140). The orthogonality and robust activity of T7 RNAP-based systems also enabled us to port our proximity-dependent split T7 RNAP-based biosensors between E. coli and mammalian systems while maintaining biosensor function. Finally, to increase the design flexibility of T7 RNAP-based sensing systems, we recently evolved away the necessity of a free C-terminus on T7 RNAP, which had previously precluded C-terminal fusions to both the full length and split T7 RNAP-based sensors (141).\nApplications of proximity-dependent split T7 RNAPs\nThe proximity-dependent split T7 RNAP-based sensor scaffold essentially allows\nmeasurement and encoding of input biomolecular interactions into a defined RNA output. For example, the split T7 RNAP biosensor scaffold naturally lends itself for use in detecting PPIs. Unlike optically-based PPI detection methods, however, the RNA-based output is both exceedingly sensitive (even small changes in output signal can be detected via PCR amplification) and highly multidimensional (due to the information storage capacity of nucleic acids). To demonstrate this concept, we used the split T7 RNAP fragments to observe the interactive interplay between the BCL2 family of apoptotic regulatory proteins, ultimately monitoring and describing a one-by-four competitive PPI interaction network via RT-qPCR of four barcoded RNA\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\npt d\nM an\nsc rip\nt\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 12\noutput signals (142). Additionally, we were able to measure pharmacological engagement of the network in a time-dependent manner, showing both on- and off-target effects of PPI inhibitors in live cells. Notably, using RNA and other genetic output signals to store biochemical information in live cells opens up interesting opportunities for bioanalysis. A recent example of this concept utilized a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based system and demonstrated translation of luciferase-based PPI optical detections into transcriptional signals (143).\nAside from producing RNA signals that store information for subsequent analysis, the\nproximity-dependent split RNAP systems can also be used to drive cellular changes based on measured input signals. For example, we have shown that the split RNAP biosensors can be used in mammalian cells to trigger production of mRNA, and therefore protein synthesis, shRNA, and therefore gene knockdown, and guide RNA (gRNA) for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout (132, 134). Moreover, we used multiple small molecule-inducible split T7 RNAP-based biosensors to drive different Cas9-mediated genome engineering responses based on disparate small molecule input signals.\nFew existing biosensor systems have the dynamic range and input versatility as split T7\nRNAP-based biosensors. Moreover, because T7 RNAP directly produces RNA from its own orthogonal, cognate promoter, it is removed from the host cell transcriptional machinery, allowing these sensors to be ported between different host systems with little need for further optimization after the initial characterization, generation, and optimization efforts. Future work expanding on both the possible inputs and outputs of split T7 RNAP-based biosensors will continue to increase the utility of the scaffold in the synthetic biologists’ tool box for the generation of genetic circuits to both detect and impact underlying biology in whichever host system is being studied. Finally, split T7 RNAP can also be repurposed into directed evolution platforms to link phenotypes to genotypes, by modulating the assembly of the T7 RNAP according to the phenotype of interest allowing evolution of interesting new biophysical protein properties (e.g. stability) (144), and, in principle, even evolving new interactions.\nCell surface receptor engineering"

Synthetic GPCRs, activated only in the presence of an otherwise pharmacologically inert small molecule, have been engineered through directed evolution (145-147), chimeric design (148), and site-directed mutagenesis (145, 149). Use of these receptors activated solely by a synthetic ligand’ (RASSLs), alternately termed ‘designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs’ (DREADDs), has steadily increased since their initial design in the late 1990s, with applications in neuroscience (extensively reviewed in: (150, 151)), cardiomyopathy (152), and skeletal function (153) research. Here, we review recent advances in increasing the sensitivity, scalability, and modularity of synthetic cell-surface signaling receptors (i.e., from ligand detection to downstream cascade activation and/or gene expression outputs), expanding their capacity for therapeutic applications (154-158), histological patterning (159, 160), and synthetic biology applications.\nGuided by genome mining, the Cornish lab identified and repurposed fungal mating\npeptide/GPCR pairs into orthogonal signaling interfaces in yeast to assemble and pattern communication topologies, building a synthetic, interdependent cell community (161). Though modeled in yeast, this scalable, modular system can likely be transported to mammalian cells to enable peptide signaling-mediated control of cellular behavior. By incorporating a proteolytic cleavage-dependent component, Lee and colleagues developed the Tango assay to detect both receptor activation and protein-protein interactions. This assay, inspired by the mechanism of Notch receptor signaling (Fig. 4A-B), relies on the expression of both a GPCR fused to a transcription factor, and an arrestin-TEV protease fusion protein (162). Ligand-mediated receptor activation leads to the TEV-mediated proteolytic cleavage of the GPCR-anchored transcription factor and expression of reporter genes (162). Tango assays have been used to measure the activity of 300+ GPCRs (163). Moreover, this platform design has been extended to additional receptor classes, including receptor tyrosine kinases and steroid hormone receptors (162). Another Notch pathway-inspired approach, synNotch, retains the small self-cleaving proteolytic region of Notch but replaces the extracellular and intracellular receptor domains to orthogonally detect a broad array of cell-surface proteins to produce customized responses (Fig. 4C) (159). The synNotch platform has enabled cell engineering efforts with applications in cancer immunotherapy (164, 165) and self-organizing tissue engineering (160).\nIncorporating modularity to surface receptor-based sensors\nBuilding a more generalizable approach to extracellular biosensing, the Leonard lab\ndeveloped Modular Extracellular Sensor Architecture (MESA) (74).

The extensive, swappable modularity of MESA allows both sensor optimization and customizable recognition of new small molecules. This plugand-play flexibility was expanded to sense a physiologically relevant input to stimulate a cellbased therapeutic response. MESA receptors engineered with single-chain variable fragments from a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody (166), dimerize in response to VEGF, release dCas9-TF, a catalytically inactive Cas9 fused to a transcriptional activation domain, resulting in secretion of interleukin-2. Multiplexing of MESA receptors expands the potential to direct diverse cellular functions (167).\nIn a directed effort to expand upon the classes of extracellular molecules recognized by cellsurface receptor-based biosensors, Fussenegger and colleagues fused antibody fragments raised against several types of medically-relevant biomolecules to the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) scaffold (168). This generalized extracellular molecule sensor (GEMS) platform incorporates modularity for the activation of disparate signaling cascades and is sensitive enough to detect clinically-relevant levels of disease biomarkers, opening up additional avenues for multiplexing and disease diagnosis, respectively. In the same vein, Chen and colleagues have recently elaborated upon existing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T-cell technologies to recognize soluble ligands (169) (previous CAR platforms recognize only surface-bound ligands (170-177)). This development is significant, as it allows targeting of secreted cytokines, shed tumor antigens, and other soluble factors associated with pathologic environments by CARexpressing T-cell-based therapies."

Cas enzymes utilize CRISPR sequences to target foreign viral DNA for cleavage and degradation. The CRISPR-Cas system has since been harnessed for genome editing and synthetic biology purposes, facilitated in particular by utilization of the type II CRISPR-Cas system protein Cas9, which possesses both nuclease activity and DNA recondition elements (reviews: (180-182)). Importantly, fusion of processed CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a trans-activating crRNA (trRNA) into a single guide RNA (sgRNA, or gRNA) sequence, aided targeting of the most commonly-used Streptococcus pyogenes-derived Cas9 (SpCas9, often simply referred to as Cas9) to specific genetic loci (183). In addition to the sgRNA, a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) adjacent to the targeted genomic locus is required for selective Cas9-mediated genome editing. Notably, Cas9\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\ne te\nd M\nan sc\nrip t\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 15\nproteins from different species of bacteria each recognize different PAM motifs (e.g., the SpCas9 and Staphylococcus aureus-derived SaCas9 enzymes recognize 5’-NGG and 5’-NNGRRT PAM sequences, respectively (184)), and are tuned to different guide RNA scaffolds, properties that have been exploited to broaden the range of Cas9 utility in both genome engineering and synthetic biology applications (185-188).\nMany of the favorable qualities that make Cas9 useful for genetic engineering also make\nit an attractive biosensor scaffold. Because it can be selectively targeted to any genomic locus, engineering Cas9 activity to be input signal-responsive is an appealing inroad to generating an output response in the form of endogenous gene expression (or blockade), which can directly influence host organism processes. A selection of the more recently generated Cas9-based biosensors and scaffolds will be discussed here; for other perspectives, see the following recent reviews: (180, 182, 189).\nTranscriptional activator and repressor Cas9 based biosensors\nA mutational variant of Cas9 known as dead Cas9 (dCas9), which is nuclease-deficient\nbut still retains its DNA recognition capabilities, is the basis of several gene transcription (CRISPRa) and repression (CRISPRi) biosensor platforms. Typically, these biosensors are generated by fusing known transcriptional activators or repressors directly to dCas9 (190-194). Subsequent sgRNA-mediated targeting of the dCas9 fusion to the gene of interest allows modulation of that gene’s transcription. Building upon this foundation, next generation designs integrate small molecule- or light-inducible PPI domain fusions to both the transcriptional activator or repressor, and dCas9 to generate a biosensor that can sense small molecule and light inputs to modulate the sgRNA-targeted gene’s expression (Fig. 5) (188, 195, 196), reviewed in (197). For example, the light-activated CRISPR-Cas9 effector (LACE) system, developed by Polstein and colleagues, fused the light-inducible CRY2 and CIB1 domains from the plant A. thaliana to the transcriptional activator VP64 and dCas9, respectively, for CRISPRa functionality following light stimulation at levels comparable to a direct, dCas9-VP64 fusion (195). Importantly, the lightinducible gene expression was reversible, spatially constrained, and non-cumulative over multiple rounds of light stimulation and removal, although a slight increase in background expression over time was noted (195). A similar approach was also utilized by the Sato laboratory, with a CRY2fused p65 transcriptional activator associating with the CIB1-fused dCas9 under blue light stimulation to drive gene expression (196). Approaches to confer small molecule-mediated control of Cas9 have generally relied upon engineering non-functional variants of the enzyme, such that application of an exogenous ligand reestablishes normal activity. One such example capitalizes\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 16\non the incorporation of inteins that render the enzyme inactive. Small molecule treatment stimulates intein splicing, and results in restored, albeit irreversible, Cas9 nuclease function (198). In another example, an FKBP12-derived destabilizing domain is fused to the Cas9 protein, targeting the enzyme for proteasomal degradation unless stabilized with the application of a highaffinity FKBP12 synthetic ligand (199).\nTo confer a dimension of orthogonality to Cas9 biosensor platforms, Gao et al. (188) coupled dCas9 enzymes from different bacterial species (S. pyogenes and S. aureus) with different small molecule-inducible PPI pairs fused with either a transcriptional activator (VPR) or a repressor (KRAB). Although the group observed disparities in the level of gene expression modulation between the two species of dCas9, possibly due to either an unoptimized sgRNA or lower DNA binding affinity for the S. aureus-derived dCas9, CRISPRa and CRISPRi outputs were both reversible and minimally cross-reactive. This orthogonality enabled the generation of Boolean logic OR and AND gates, as well NOR and NAND gates (188). This particular synthetic circuit design expanded the utility of dCas9-based synthetic circuitry beyond the previous dCas9mediated control of gene activation (200-203). Further control of this platform can be gained via integration with the RNAP Cas9 controller developed by our group, which removes the necessity for native polymerases to transcribe gRNA (203). Finally, Liang et al. developed Cas-based biosensors for targeted, inducible editing of the epigenome (204), further expanding the scope of outputs capable of Cas-based biosensor systems.\nSplit and protease-responsive Cas9 based biosensors\nAs with the PCA systems previously discussed in this review, the Cas9 enzyme has also\nbeen split to produce an assembly-dependent biosensor with genome editing or host gene expression regulation outputs. Both electron microscope studies and X-ray crystallography of Cas9 have informed upon the structure-function relationship of the enzyme (205-207), facilitating the generation of various split Cas9 variants (208). Using this, Wright and colleagues rationally engineered a split Cas9 whose separate nuclease and α-helical fragments were recruited and reassembled only in the presence of full-length, unmodified sgRNA (Fig. 4) (209). The authors additionally postulated that fusing other PPI domains to the split fragments would facilitate the generation of inducible Cas9 activity. Indeed, both light- and small molecule-mediated reassembly of split Cas9 have since been pursued. Building upon their aforementioned work with full-length Cas9, the Sato laboratory employed the photoactivatable dimerization protein system known as Magnet, which is smaller in size than the CRY2 and CIB1 pair, to generate a photoactivatable Cas9 platform (paCas9), capable of both spatiotemporal controlled genome editing and reversible\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\ne e\nM an\nus cr\nip t\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 17\ndCas9-mediated CRISPRi (210). After further optimization, the same research group utilized their split dCas9 platform for light-inducible CRISPRa applications, and in particular, to activate neuronal differentiation gene expression programs in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (211). Integration of split Cas9 with intein-based (212, 213) and small molecule-dependent reassembly (214) has imbued this biosensor platform with additional tunability and tight control over transcription events. Though a relatively nascent biosensor scaffold, this platform harbors an enormous amount of potential for use in in vivo contexts. Aside from the general portability of these enzymes across several model organisms, including yeast (S. cerevisiae (215)), fruit flies (D. melanogaster (216, 217)), zebrafish (D. rerio (218)), nematodes (C. elegans (219)), plants (A. thaliana and N. benthamiana (220)), rodents (M. musculus (221) and R. norvegicus (222)), as well as non-human primate (M. mulatta (223) and M. facicularis (224)) and human (H. sapiens) embryos (225) and cell lines, the split Cas9 platform simplifies packaging of the biosensor constructs into viral vectors for efficient and effective delivery and expression.\nA much more recent Cas9 variant, generated by Savage et al. via circular permutation\n(226), linked the original N- and C-termini with a long flexible peptide linker (15-20 amino acids) and generated new N and C termini available for protein fusions (Fig. 5) (227). Although this topological rearrangement did not affect normal Cas9 enzymatic activity, a shorter linker containing the TEV protease recognition sequence effectively produced a ‘caged’ Cas9 variant, whose function was restored upon cleavage via the TEV protease (proCas9). Savage and colleagues demonstrated the utility of these protease-responsive Cas9 enzymes by generating a panel of virally active protease/proCas9 pairs to induce protective apoptosis of virally infected cells, thereby preventing the spread of infection (227). Beyond this specific application, the prospective usefulness of the panel of orthogonal protease/proCas9 pairs generated in this report to biosensing and synthetic biology applications should not be overlooked. For example, they have been applied to improve the biosynthetic yield of glutarate (228), and integrated with a sgRNA-RNA aptamer fusion to detect cancer-specific markers and rescue oncogenic phenotypes\n(229).\nRepurposing of active, partially active (nickase), and dead Cas9 proteins as biosensor\nscaffolds can be utilized to target endogenous gene loci based upon the sequence targeting capacity of its sgRNA sequence. Although some issues with the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology have arisen, such as off-target genome editing (230, 231) and activation of host cell immune responses (232, 233), this platform remains a promising foundation for the development of tools for synthetic biology and genetic engineering. For example, continuing advancements in the temporal and/or spatiotemporal control of Cas9 activity – recently demonstrated with the\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep d\nM an\nus c\nip t\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 18\ndiscovery of small molecule CRISPR-Cas9 inhibitors (234) – the discovery of anti-CRISPR proteins (235-240), and engineering of variants that can be combined in multiplexed formats all hold potential for future generation of synthetic biology circuits and biosensors to both report on endogenous cellular signaling and regulate gene expression/activation/repression (8). Finally, recently-discovered RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems such as the Cas13 family of proteins will likely lead to synthetic biology opportunities (241-244), reviewed in (245). Indeed, we recently engineered RNA effectors based on exploiting ‘epitranscriptomic’ pathways to create programmable RNA-interacting proteins that drive translation or deadenylation (246). Moreover, we were recently able to engineer ‘humanized’ RNA-targeting effector proteins (247), opening up opportunities in deploying these epitranscriptome-targeting systems in humans while avoiding immunogenicity issues."

      "text" : "Numerous diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and diabetes, have\nbeen correlated with changes in the gut microbiome (248, 249). As such, manipulation of the microbiome is an appealing therapeutic strategy. Based on the health benefits of probiotic treatments (250, 251), recent efforts have aimed to engineer cells to secrete therapeutic proteins, such as anti-inflammatory cytokines (252, 253), insulinotropic proteins (254), and metabolic enzymes (255). Microbiome engineering has also afforded new methods for detecting signals such as small molecules related to pathogens (256) and cancer (257). One challenge in this pursuit is the optimization of molecular tools that perform in commensal organisms. To address this, the Lu laboratory developed genetic parts, including promoters, ribosome-binding sites, and orthogonal small molecule-inducible systems, for use in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prevalent member of the human gut microbiome, to repress exogenous and endogenous gene expression via CRISPRi (258). Importantly, these synthetic genetic circuits remained unperturbed for up to 12 days following transplantation of the engineered B. thetaiotaomicron into the gut microbiome of mice. Using a newly-identified phage promoter and strategy to tune protein expression, the Sonnenburg lab identified an array of promoters with a million-fold expression range, enabling fluorescent protein reporter-mediated differentiation between six different Bacteroides species within the gut (259). For diverse microbial communities that cannot easily be cultivated in the lab, general methods for in situ microbiome engineering could enable direct modification of microbes with desired genetic circuits (260-262). For example, the metagenomic alteration of gut microbiome by in situ conjugation (MAGIC) platform utilizes an E. coli donor strain to deliver replicative or integrative vectors into amenable gut microbiota (263).

Together, these comprise significant advancements in the ability to assemble and integrate genetic constructs into microbes to systematically and reliably regulate protein expression in the live gut.\nAn additional goal for these platforms is the capacity to monitor and respond to disease-\nor metabolism-related changes in the gut microbiota. As such, engineered microbes containing genetic circuits for sensing and later recalling environmental stimuli inputs could be used to generate diagnostic and therapeutic outputs (264-266). In a recent example of this, the Silver lab developed synthetic memory devices to non-invasively measure gut microbial responses with a transcriptional trigger that records environmental stimuli (267-269). Activation of the trigger, via molecular byproducts of inflammation, turns on a genetic memory circuit with long-term stability, even after months of cell division events in the mouse gut. Building on these principles and expanding the synthetic biology microbiome toolbox could yield new targeted strategies to engineer microbes capable of sensing and responding to gut dysbiosis with a complexity and responsiveness that mimics that of the native microbiome."

However, the incorporation of new biosensor scaffolds into the synthetic biology toolbox has been constrained by the investment needed to first highly characterize proteins in order to facilitate subsequent biosensor design and engineering efforts. In this review, we compiled recent innovations and advancements that have led to the generation of robust, reliable, and flexible biosensors, namely improved PCA biosensors, such as protease responsive biosensors and orthogonal enzyme/small molecule biosensor pairs, T7 RNAP biosensors, cell surface receptor biosensors, Cas9 biosensors, and microbial biosensors. In each case, extensive engineering efforts were required to generate the initial biosensor to detect the desired input, as well as to optimize the biosensor’s properties. While recent advances have led to more versatile platforms, with some approaching true ‘plug-and-play’ flexibility, the generation of complex synthetic circuits and organisms still generally requires extensive engineering efforts and remain, for the most part, non-transferable between model systems. In spite of this, many of the biosensors reviewed here are indeed portable across different organisms and, when combined with other advancements in artificial multicellular systems (270, 271), provide synthetic biologists with new tools to effectively design biological mimics and increase their specificity.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 20\nMany of the biosensors discussed in this review have shown utility in building Boolean\nlogic genetic circuits, such as with the T7 RNAP and Cas9 biosensors, and integration into host cell biological processes, such as with cell surface receptor biosensors, resulting in the generation of complex systems including microbial population engineering and CAR T-cell therapies. In addition to the examples mentioned in this review, other developments in the area of biosensor technologies include the integration of biological components with electronic or optical elements to generate biosensors that can detect and quantitate target analyte inputs in complex samples, such as food matrices and environmental samples (272, 273). Ostensibly, these types of biosensors can be used to great effect for food safety and environmental pollution monitoring. As our continued understanding of native biological pathways and protein engineering improves, we anticipate the generation of robust, reliable, and programmable biosensors will continue to advance as well. Ultimately, synthetic biology approaches have the potential to revolutionize fundamental research, imaging and diagnostics, clinical therapeutics, artificial cellular mimetics, and industrial and environmental applications, goals which will be accelerated by the development of improved biosensor scaffolds."

Classic biosensor platforms produce gene reporter outputs in response to ligand inputs. A) For basic transcription factor-based biosensors, ligand-mediated changes in protein conformation either facilitate (top) or block (bottom) transcription factor binding to gene promoters. In both cases, the cell’s transcriptional machinery is recruited to express a reporter gene. B) In this example of a riboswitch, ligand-induced structural alterations obstruct ribosome binding and reporter gene translation (left), while the absence of ligand permits reporter gene translation (right).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 24\nFigure 2.

B) Directed evolution of T7 RNAP N-terminal variants that confer enhanced PPI-dependent output generation. Phage-assisted continuous evolution utilizing ZA and ZB isoleucine zipper peptide-fused split T7 RNAP fragments were used to select for mutational variants. Six mutations in the N-29-1 and ten mutations in the d5-19 variants resulted in respective >200- and >2000-fold increases in PPI-dependent luminescent output, as compared with wild-type (wt). C) Rapamycin-dependent dimerization of FRB and FKBP pendant peptides fused to split T7 RNAP fragments drive reassembly of the RNAP, resulting in reporter gene (green fluorescent protein; GFP) expression.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA\ncc\ne te\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 26\nFigure 4. Comparison of Notch-based biosensor platforms. A) Upon binding with cognate cell-surface signaling proteins, the intracellular domain of wild-type Notch receptors is proteolytically cleaved by γ-secretase, producing a nuclear-translocating transcription factor that promotes gene expression. B) Fusion of a transcription factor to receptor tyrosine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), or steroid hormone receptors via a linker containing a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cut site forms the basis of the Tango Assay. Ligand-mediated receptor activation recruits the TEV protease, which cleaves the transcription factor and subsequently drives reporter gene expression. C) The highly modular synNotch biosensor platform utilizes the wild-type Notch γ-secretase cleavage site but allows for customization of both the receptor and transcription factor elements. As with wild-type Notch, activation of the synNotch receptor by its cognate signaling protein recruits γ-secretase to proteolytically free the transcription factor and activate gene expression.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nJones, Zinkus-Boltz and Dickinson; Biosensors for synthetic biology 27\nFigure 5.

Informed by biology and customized through rational design and evolutionary methods, these molecular protein scaffolds translate input signals into tractable outputs. By using biosensors to introduce synthetic gene circuits and cellular signaling pathways into host organisms, naturally-occurring biological processes can be harnessed and tailored for a wide range of applications. In this review, we have compiled recent innovations and advancements that have led to the generation of robust, reliable, and flexible biosensors for utility across basic biological research and synthetic biology tools, including biological engineering efforts and clinical applications.",
