Here, we fabricated Mo nanoparticles with a giant compressive strength surpassing the previous strength records of metallic materials. Round and faceted particles were produced by manipulating the annealing atmosphere during two-stage solid-state dewetting of Mo thin films deposited on sapphire. The round particle underwent a huge elastic deformation before yielding abruptly. Using finite element analysis, we found that the resolved shear stress on a {112} 〈 110 〉 slip system beneath the punch reaches an enormous value of 20 ±1 GPa at yield, regardless of particle size. The faceted nanoparticles, contrarily, followed a “smaller is stronger” rule, with uniaxial compressive strength of up to 46 GPa for the smallest nanoparticles. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the size effect diminishes with increasing roundness of the particle edges. This work demonstrates how shape and size of particles can be manipulated to achieve giant strength.\n© 2020 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\nIt is now well-established that plastic deformation of crystals of sub-micrometer dimensions proceeds very different from the plastic deformation of bulk crystalline materials [1] . The main reasons behind this change of mechanical behavior with decreasing sample size is an extreme scarcity of dislocation sources at such small scales, and abundance of free surfaces to which the dislocations can escape [ 2 , 3 ]. The term “dislocations starvation” was coined to describe the plastic deformation controlled by nucleation of new dislocations, rather than by the motion of pre-existing dislocations and activity of the internal dislocation sources [4] . The nucleation of new dislocations in structurally perfect single crystal requires much higher stresses than those needed for the activation of pre-existing dislocation sources. This is the reason why an ultrahigh strength was observed in pristine single crystalline samples of a number of different inorganic materials, such as metals [ 3 , 5 , 6 ], semiconductors [7] , and ceramics [8] (see also Ref. [9] and references therein). These new ultra-strong materials (such as nanoparticles and nanowhiskers) can find a wide range of applications\n∗ Corresponding authors.

To enable the development of ew materials and systems based on the ultra-strong microscopic ingle-crystalline components, the laws governing their deformaion behavior, and the upper limits of their strength should be etter understood. The striking examples of the differences in the\nechanical behavior of small single crystalline samples and their\nulk counterparts include the strong dependence of the strength f small samples on their shape [11–16] , deformation-induced for-\nation of metastable phases in pure metals [ 17 , 18 ], and different\nependencies of strength on composition. Indeed, while alloying a ure bulk metal with the second component represents the most ommon way of increasing its strength, an opposite trend of dereasing strength was observed during the nanoscale deformation f the Cu-Au alloy [19] .\nThe present work is focused on the shape and size effects in he small-scale mechanical behavior of Mo microparticles. It was emonstrated in recent molecular dynamic (MD) simulations that ompression strength of single-crystalline nanoparticles of various ace-Centered Cubic (FCC) metals [ 3 , 6 , 15 ], Ni 3 Al [13] , Fe [ 14 , 16 ],\no [20] and Si [21] strongly depends on the particles shape, nd in particular on the roundness of the facet corners [22] . A ystematic smoothing of the sharp corners formed by atomically at low-index facets in the MD simulations led to the change of\nd f l a n n w m e d d b s p d o p d b t o c s t c c t m i p\ne ( w d t M g p c p o s p a o w m t d t m\n2\n2\no g d w m w d i\nd L\nt t r t b m m P t r P a b m f a l m d l c o a ( s d\n2\nn e t n o p s s c f d i s w p c d t w k s {\n2\nt p p a { o M\nislocation nucleation mode from heterogeneous nucleation at the\nacet corners to the homogeneous nucleation of full dislocation oops in the particle interior. This change was accompanied by\nsignificant increase in the critical compressive stress needed to ucleate the first dislocation loop. An ultra-high strength of Ni anoparticles with rounded corners observed in the experiment as interpreted in terms of the change of dislocation nucleation\node from heterogeneous to homogeneous nucleation [6] . Howver, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic experimental ata on the effect of particles shape on their strength, and on size ependence of strength are available in the literature. It should e stressed that because of the high sensitivity of the nanoscale trength to the internal microstructure of the sample and to the resence of crystal defects (such as twin- and grain boundaries, islocation and their sources, etc.), a meaningful study of the effect f the samples shape on their strength is only possible on the samles prepared by identical processing methods, and exhibiting low ensity of defects. For example, a strong difference in mechanical ehavior of spherical Si nanoparticles and Si nanopillars can be atributed to the different fabrication methods [23] . As for the effect f shape on the size effect in strength, the available information is ontradictory: a handful of published experimental studies report a trong size effect in the compression strength of faceted nanoparicles [ 3 , 6 ], while a size-effect with saturation below some critial size was observed during compression of round Fe nanopartiles [24] . The present work fills this gap in the existing knowledge hrough the systematic study of the compression behavior of Mo\nicroparticles of various shapes and sizes obtained by manipulatng the conditions of solid-state dewetting of thin Mo films on c-\nlane ((0 0 02) Al 2 O 3 ) sapphire substrate.\nThis paper is organized as follows: After we have described the xperimental and computational methods employed in this study Section 2 ), we present the morphologies of the Mo particles that\nere obtained during the late stages of solid state dewetting, and escribe the two-stage dewetting process developed to produce he particles with shapes close to the equilibrium crystal shape of\no ( Section 3.1 ). We show that varying the partial pressure of oxyen during annealing enables obtaining round and highly faceted articles. We then describe the results of nanomechanical in-situ ompression tests of round ( Section 3.2 ) and faceted ( Section 3.3 ) articles. The results of atomistic MD simulations of compression f Mo particles of different sizes and degrees of roundness are preented in Section 3.4 . In the Discussion part ( Section 4 ) we comare the experimentally determined strength levels of the round nd faceted particles. We rationalize the size effect in the strength f faceted particles based on our MD simulations results. Finally,\ne present an Ashby-type strength plot in the coordinates “noralized strength – normalized sample size”, demonstrating that he relative strength of Mo particles produced by the two-stage ewetting process developed in the present study is higher than he reported strength values of most other sub-micrometer size\netal samples.\n. Experimental and computational methods\n.1. Experimental\nThe ensembles of sub-micrometer sized molybdenum particles f faceted and round shapes (see Section 3 ) were fabricated on sinle crystalline (0 0 02) c -plane sapphire substrates via a solid-state ewetting technique. Ultra-thin Mo films of 20 nm in thickness\nere deposited on the c -plane oriented sapphire substrate using agnetron sputtering. Prior to the deposition, the substrate wafers ere ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol, isopropanol, and e-ionized water in the cleanroom. The deposition was performed\nn the radio-frequency magnetron sputtering apparatus (Von Ar-\nenne) using high purity Mo target (99.9 wt.% purity, Kurt J. esker).\nAnnealing of as-deposited films was performed in the highemperature tube furnace (MTI GSL - 1500x – OTF) equipped with he mullite tube in the flow of forming gas (Ar-10% H 2 , 5 N puity). Although the dewetting of the Mo film on sapphire begins at he 940 °C, the fully agglomerated islands of metal were obtained y annealing the films at 1380 °C in the same Ar-10% H 2 environent for 24 hrs. The partial pressure of oxygen during heat treat-\nents was controlled with the aid of ZrO 2 oxygen sensor (Carbo-\nrobe DS, Econox). The morphology of the particles formed after he solid-state dewetting was characterized by performing highesolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM, Carl Zeiss Ultralus) using a secondary electron detector at an acceleration voltge of 4 keV. The surface topography of the particles was studied y atomic force microscopy (AFM; Park Systems XE-70) in tapping\node. The micro-compression testing of the particles was perormed using an in-situ Hysitron PI85 picoindenter equipped with\ndiamond flat punch tip with a flat part diameter of 1 μm. The oad-displacement data was recorded in a displacement-controlled\node with a constant nominal displacement rate of 1 nm/s. Load-\nisplacement data were measured after the thermal drift became\ness than 0.02 nm/s. The secondary electron images of the partiles were collected before and after the compression to avoid the verestimation of strength due to compression of multiple particles t a time. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy HRTEM; FEI Titan 80–300 kV S/TEM) was used to analyze crossection samples, which were prepared by the lift-out method in a\nual beam focused ion beam (FIB; FEI Strata 400-S).\n.2. Finite element analysis\nAn elastic anisotropic round particle was constructed in the fiite element analysis (FEA) simulation tool LS-DYNA. A rounded lastic sphere, truncated on one side to represent to interface with he substrate, was constructed. The particle was meshed with eight oded hexahedron elements with 100 elements across the radius f the particle. An anisotropic elastic stiffness tensor was emloyed, rotated in two different directions to represent compresion along the 〈 110 〉 and 〈 111 〉 directions. The values of the tenor components are taken from Dickinson and Armstrong [25] . The ompression of the particle was performed between two rigid suraces. The bottom surface was held fixed while the top surface was\nisplaced with 20 increments of 1% of the particle radius in each\nncrement. Perfect slip conditions were defined between the top urface and the particle, while the bottom nodes of the particle\nere glued to the bottom surface, constraining the bottom of the article to be fixed to the surface. The compression force was calulated on the upper surface. From the FEA we obtained a forceisplacement curve for elastic compression of an anisotropic paricle. Taking the force measured in the compression experiments,\ne found the corresponding deformation in the simulation. Then,\nnowing the calculated stress tensor in every element in the FEA imulation, we computed the maximum resolved shear stress on 110} < 111 > and {112} < 111 > slip systems.\n.3. Molecular dynamics simulations\nMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using he LAMMPS [26] . An embedded atom method (EAM) interatomic otential was employed with a parametrization for Mo atoms proosed by Ackland et al. [27] . Initially, a faceted particle was generted utilizing the known Winterbottom construction method, with 100}, {110} and {112} facets, based on the dimensions and shape f the experimental particles. The sharp edges were rounded in the\nD simulations by excluding atoms outside a sphere of radius r\np f\nt i t t d e r d c c e o i t g f p h a i n l i\ncentered at the Wulff point. Different limiting sphere radii were considered and we defined the roundness parameter χ according to: χ = (\nr − R 1 R 2 − R 1\n) 1 2\n(1)\nwhere R 1 and R 2 are the distances between the Wulff point and the upper (110) facet and the furthest atom in the fully faceted particle (a surface atom located between three {112} facets), respectively. χ= 1 is the fully faceted nanoparticle (when the sphere’ radius is equal to the distance of the furthest atom from the Wulff point) and χ= 0 is a fully rounded particle (when the radius is the equal to the distance between the Wulff point and the upper facet). We note that all particles with χ between 0 and 1 are of the same height.\nThe particle was placed on a rigid substrate considered as a single crystalline Mo rigid crystal, oriented in the [110] direction to form a perfect lattice match with the particle. The nanoparticles are first relaxed at the temperature of 300 K for 100,000 timesteps, followed by compression in the canonical ensemble, controlling the temperature around 300 K. A timestep of 5 fsec is chosen in all simulations (this timestep was found to yield stable timestepindependent results). The compression was achieved using a virtual planar indent, moving downward at a constant engineering strain rate of 10 8 sec − 1 , exerting a force on all atoms that are above the plane. The force on each atom is linearly proportional to the distance above the plane, with a spring coefficient equal to 10 eV Å −2 . During compression, we count on-the-fly the number of atoms that are in contact with the indent in each timestep. Assuming the lattice spacing on the top surface remains constant during compression, we calculate the temporal contact area during compression from the number of atoms in the contact region, from which the true stress on the top surface is calculated.\n3. Results\n3.1. The shape and morphology of the particles\nThe full dewetting of films and formation of isolated Mo particles was observed after annealing the films at 1380 °C for 24 h in the flow of forming gas. The high-resolution secondary electron images of the as-deposited film and micro-particles formed after annealing are shown in Fig. 1 (a,b). The islands of the metal exhibited flat \"pancake\"-like shape, which is far from the equilibrium crystal shape (ECS) of Mo [28] . The 3D AFM image ( Fig 1 (c)) indicates that the average height of particles is ~ 100 nm, while their width varies from 0.5 to 1.2 μm. The particles with such a low as-\nect ratio resemble the patches of a thin film and are not suitable\nor micro-compression experiments.\nA possible way to increase the aspect ratio of the particles is he agglomeration of the already formed particles and their sinterng during the second annealing, provided that agglomerated paricles develop large angle grain boundaries (GBs). This is based on he previous results indicating that the presence of the GBs and\nislocations supplies the crystal defects which accelerate the shape volution of Au particles towards the equilibrium [ 29 , 30 ]. The most obust and chemically clean way to modify the particles is by proucing a scratch on the surface of the sample using a piece of the lean sapphire wafer, creating the local agglomerates of the partiles near the edge of the scratch. The methodology used is very ffective for the production of the single crystalline metal particles f very different sizes, because of an arbitrary number of particles n each of the sintered agglomerates. The scratching itself produces he high concentration of dislocations and other defects, which toether with the GBs between the individual particles significantly acilitate the equilibration kinetics of the agglomerates. This step\nrovided the desired solution for the production of the relatively igh aspect ratio particles of varying sizes at the sub-micrometer nd even micrometer length scales. The Fig. 2 displays the HR-SEM mage of particles in the vicinity of the scratch after additional anealing at 1380 °C for 24 h (200 sccm flow of forming gas, see beow). It can be seen that the agglomerated particles undergo sinterng and form large faceted single-crystalline particles. On the other\nh i r n a s s r o d\nM fl g t w a ( a g t o s r t t t 〈\ni f a d t t p l s o M T o b a l p e s\na o t | s [\n3\nf a c p s o d a o T p p l a r a u b v b m\np p m f p a v p l c s t d t t c\nand, the isolated particles which were not affected by scratch-\nng remain more or less unchanged and preserve their low aspect atio. The sintering of agglomerated particles during long-term an-\nealing at elevated temperatures resulted in intensive grain boundry migration and transformation of polycrystalline aggregates into ingle crystalline and dislocation-free microparticles. This is conistent with the results of earlier studies of the deformation and ecrystallization of refractory metals, in which the single crystals f high structural perfection with the average distance between inividual dislocations larger than 10 μm were obtained [31] . Moreover, we uncovered that the morphology and ECS of the\no particles after the second annealing strongly depends on the\now of forming gas and the corresponding partial pressure of oxyen. When dewetting the particles in a gas flow of Ar-10% H 2 in he range of 200 sccm, the degree of the surface energy anisotropy\nas low, which resulted in particles with almost round appear-\nnce characterized by a large number of small high-index facets see high-resolution scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM) imges in Figs 2 and 3 (a-b). Separate measurements with the oxyen sensor indicated that this flow of forming gas corresponds to he partial oxygen pressure of 10 −14 atm. The exact identification f these facets by the atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based local urface slope method is difficult because of their small size, their elatively high indexes, and insufficient AFM resolution [32] . Still, he approximate shape can be reconstructed (as shown in Fig. S1 in he Supplementary Information), indicating that out of plane orienation of the round particles is randomly distributed between the 110 〉 and 〈 111 〉 directions. Decreasing the gas flow to 10 sccm during the second annealng resulted in formation of faceted Mo particles. This flow of orming gas corresponds to the partial oxygen pressure of 10 −12 tm. The Fig. 3 (c) shows that the formed particles exhibited well-\neveloped facets with sharp edges. The local surface slope orienation mapping performed as described in Ref. [32] allows idenifying the facets as {110}, {100} and {112} (Sec. S1 in the Suplementary Information), which corresponds to the surfaces of the owest energy in the metals with the Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) tructure [28] . All observed particles preserved the initial 〈 110 〉 ut of plane orientation of the original Mo film and the pristine\no islands. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HREM) measurements have been carried out along the cross-section f one of the sintered particles. The sintered particle is found to e single crystalline with no signs of grain boundaries or pores, nd exhibits well-defined faceted morphology ( Fig. 4 (a)). The TEM amella was cut off-center of the particle, and this is why the up-\ner ( 1 ̄1 0 ) facet parallel to the substrate cannot be observed. Interstingly, the interface between the sintered particle and the subtrate is atomically sharp, which is confirmed by the HR-TEM im-\nge shown in Fig. 4 (b). Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) patterns were btained from the HR-TEM images to identify the orientation relaionship (OR) between the particle and sapphire substrate, (110)Mo | (0 0 02)Al 2 O 3 : [0 01]Mo || [ 2 ̄1 ̄1 0 ]Al 2 O 3 . The same OR was oberved between the as-deposited Mo film and sapphire substrate 33] .\n.2. Compression of round particles\nThe round particles were subjected to uniaxial compression deormation in the SEM using a Hysitron Picoindentor with a flat dimond punch of around 1 μm in diameter. The load-displacement urves shown in Fig. 5 (a) display a nearly elastic deformation of\narticles to a high value of strain, followed by an abrupt large train burst caused by a catastrophic failure: a typical “signature” f nucleation controlled plasticity. In all the particles, the load rops suddenly during this strain burst, and particles collapse to\npancake-like disk. The catastropic nature of the plastic collapse f the particle is illustrated in the in-situ Supplementary Movie S1. he shapes of a deformed particle at different stages of the comression as observed in HR-SEM are shown in Fig. S2 of the Suplementary Information. This type of mechanical response is simi-\nar to that observed in dislocation-free Ni [6] and Au [3] particles nd Mo-alloys pillars [34] . The purely elastic behavior in the initial egion of the load-displacement curve is further confirmed by the bsence of hysteresis during the deformation (multiple loading-\nnloading) of particles up to the load slightly below the strain urst. It should be noted that this type of compression behavior is ery different from the one observed in Si nanoparticles produced y hypersonic plasma deposition, which exhibited the dislocations-\nediated plasticity at the early stages of compression [35] .\nTo calculate the maximum resolved shear stress (RSS), FEA was erformed. Owing to the giant strength of the particles, the dislacement measured in the experiments includes both the defor-\nation of the particle but also other non-negligible contributions rom the deformation of the substrate, punch and machine com-\nliance. Since the latter is unknown, we assumed a rigid substrate nd punch in the FEA simulations, and compared the calculated alues of the compressive forces with those measured in the exeriments. In the simulations, a round particle with a truncated ower part was compressed by a moving plane. The particles were onsidered to obey linear anisotropic elasticity with stiffness contants obtained from Ref. [25] . In accordance with the experimenal observations, particles were oriented either in the [110] or [111]\nirections. By matching the measured force of the strain burst with he calculated one, we determined the stress field inside the paricle at the onset of plasticity. Knowing the full stress field, we omputed the RSS on two available slip systems: {110} < 111 > and\na s m t t t o t p\n3\nb s c f d h l s f g v t v b t s s l d s f t fi u c T n v n m t h\n{112} < 111 > . Then, at each point, we selected the highest RSS value of the two. In all cases, the highest RSS was found on a {112} < 111 > slip direction, and an example is given in Fig. 5 (b).\nDespite the high stiffness of the diamond tip, its contribution to the overall deformation is not negligible and should be accounted for using Hertz theory. According to the Hertz model for elastically isotropic solids, the average contact pressure during elastic loading is related to the effective elastic constant E ∗ = (\n1 − ν2 Mo E Mo + 1 − ν 2 dia E dia\n)−1 (2)\nwhere E and ν are the Young moduli and Poisson’s ratios, and the subscripts “Mo” and “dia” refer to Mo and diamond, respectively. Our FEA calculations correspond to an effective elastic constant of E ∗∞ = E Mo / ( 1 − ν2 Mo ) . Applying Hertz’ model to the FEA results yields E ∗∞ = 322 and 305 GPa for the compression along the [110] and [111] directions, respectively (see Sec. S3 in the Supplementary Information file). Given that we set the dislocation nucleation force from the experiments, for the different values of E ∗ and the same contact geometry the contact pressure should scale as E ∗2/3 (based on Eqs. (S1) and (S2) in the Supplementary Information). Thus, in order to estimate the effect of the tip stiffness on the experimental results, we scale the highest RSS found at the onset of plasticity in the FEA by ( E ∗/E ∗∞ ) 2 / 3 . The resulting dependence of the highest RSS on the particle diameter for E dia = 1050 GPa and νdia = 0.33 is shown in Fig. 5 (c). In cases the particle orientation was unknown, we plotted the values as a range. This analysis results in a sizeindependent stress, with a mean value of 20 ±1 GPa, without any significant difference in strength between the 〈 110 〉 and 〈 111 〉 oriented particles. This is an extraordinary high value of the RSS for the onset of plasticity, yet the similar levels of maximum (unresolved) shear stress at the onset of displacement bursts in metals were observed in the nanoindentation studies of annealed Mo (19.5 GPa, [36] ) and W (28.6 GPa [37] ) single crystals with the surfaces carefully prepared by electrochemical polishing. Though there is some similarity and reciprocity between the contact geometry of the present study (flat diamond punch vs. round metal particle) and of the nanoindentation studies [ 36 , 37 ] (round diamond asperity vs. flat metal surface), to the best of our knowledge the RSS at the onset of plastic yield obtained in the present work represents the highest RSS value reported experimentally for the uniaxial compression testing of submicrometer-size metal samples.\nIn the following Section we will describe the results of nanomechanical testing of faceted Mo particles. In this case, the engineering stress was defined by dividing the applied load by the\nrea of the top (011) facet. To perform a comparative analysis of trength of the round and faceted particles, we determined the\naximum contact pressure (MCP) at the onset of plasticity for he former. The estimates performed with the aid of Hertz conact theory (See Supplementary Material in Sec. S3, Fig. S3(b)) for he round Mo particles yielded the size-independent value of MCP f 44.7 ± 2.5 GPa. For comparison, the MCP of the round Fe paricles exhibiting similar mechanical behavior was 10.7 GPa for the articles smaller than 200 nm in diameter [24] .\n.3. Compression of faceted particles\nThe compression strength of faceted particles is determined y performing in-situ micro-compression experiments with the ame parameters as used for micro-compression of round partiles. The typical load-displacement data for faceted particles of diferent sizes are shown in Fig. 6 (a). The curves are similar to load-\nisplacement curves obtained for round particles: linear elastic beavior up to the large strain, followed by an abrupt drop in the\noad due to catastrophic failure. In order to compare the compresive strength of microparticles of different sizes, we should transorm the load-displacement data into stress-strain curves. The enineering stress is defined by the load applied by the indenter diided by the initial area of the upper facet of the particle in conact with the punch. The engineering strain is determined by diiding the displacement of the indenter in the loading direction\ny the initial height of the particle (it should be noted that the rue strain of the particle is lower because of the punch and subtrate deformation). Fig. 6 (b) shows the typical compressive stresstrain plots of various particles, determined from the experimental oad-displacement data. The stress-strain curves shown in Fig. 6 (b)\nisplay a clear size dependence, with small particles being much tronger than their larger counterparts. This behavior is very diferent from the size-independent strength observed for round paricles ( Fig. 5 (c)). The compressive strength of a particle was de-\nned as the engineering stress right before the catastrophic failre of the particle. Fig. 6 (c) shows the quantitative assessment of ompressive strength by plotting it against the particle diameter. he results obtained are fitted with a power-law σ = AD −n ( A and are constants) and give the size exponent n = 1.0 ± 0.15. The alue of size exponent obtained in the present investigation is sigificantly higher than the values deduced from the deformation of\nicro- and nanopillars of most BCC metals. However, it is imporant to note that the single crystalline BCC molybdenum pillars exibit both size-dependent [38] and size-independent [34] compres-\nw b c h a t n M t e f o s c s i t\n4\n4\ns t i d M f i o o v p t g c i f l t e o p t t e b a t t o l f g c c i n b\no f t s m\nsive strength. The most interesting finding is the ultra-high compressive strength of the Mo nanoparticles measured in the present work and reaching 46 GPa (for the faceted particles with the top facet diameter of ~ 110 nm). This value is much higher than the ultimate compressive strength reported for bulk Mo [39] and singlecrystalline Mo pillars [ 34 , 38 ]. This high compressive stress is similar to the value of MCP at the onset of plastic yield estimated for the round Mo particles (44.7 ± 2.5 GPa, see Supplementary Material in Sec. S3, Fig. S3(b)).\n3.4. MD simulations of the particles compression\nIt was previously shown that the size effect in strength of faceted nanoparticles can be captured in MD simulations [ 3 , 15 , 40 ], while FEA can neither capture nor predict the size dependence only by calculating the maximum RSS. For a better understanding of the atomistic mechanisms behind the high levels of strength achieved in our experiments, and of the effect of size on strength of the faceted particles, we have performed MD simulations of compression of the particles ranging from 10 nm to 65 nm in height with different roundnesses at the edges (see Section 2.3 for details). A roundness parameter χ , which ranges from 0 (fully rounded) to 1 (perfectly faceted), is defined according to Eq. (1) and the simulations are performed for values of χ between 0.4 to 1. An example for two different shapes is given in Fig. 7 (a). Lower values of χ are impractical in MD simulations because of the problems associated with the stepped character of the surface of nearly-spherical particles. From the true stress curve, we obtain the stress at the first load drop, which we associate with plastic yielding of the particle. The resulting size dependencies of compressive strengths for particles with different roundnesses are summarized in Fig. 7 (b). All simulated particles exhibited a pronounced size effect. Similarly to the experiments, the dependence of compressive plastic yield strength on the size obeys a powerlaw. We find that the size effect is more pronounced for the more faceted particles ( χ > 0.7), and as the particle becomes rounded ( χ ≤ 0.7) the size effect exponent reaches a saturation.\nThe MD simulations reproduce a power-law size dependence of the yield strength; however, the corresponding size exponent is different from the one obtained in the experiments. Moreover, contrary to the experimental observations, the size effect in MD simulations does not vanish for highly rounded particles. This discrepancy highlights the differences between the simulations and the experiments. In previous studies, it was shown that in some cases the strength of crystalline particles is size-dependent [ 3 , 6 , 15 , 16 ], while in some cases it is not [13] . Based on these studies, the sizeeffect was attributed to the stress concentration at the top vertices of the faceted particles, where dislocations are nucleated at the onset of plasticity. In the range χ > 0.7, in which faceting is pronounced, the larger roundness (i.e. smaller values of parameter χ ) manifests itself in a less sensitive size effect, as can be seen in the exponents in Fig. 7 (c). Theoretically, we would expect for this trend to continue as we round the edges, and for the size effect to vanish for fully round particles. However, due to the discreteness of the atomic structure, when large roundness is applied ( χ ≤ 0.7), the atomic surface steps around and beneath the top facet become predominant. Now, nucleation occurs heterogeneously at these atomic steps serving as local stress concentrators for nucleation (see Fig. 7 (d)). Since the atomic steps exhibit constant, size- and shape-independent local morphology for all round particles with χ ≤ 0.7, the stress concentration at the step becomes shape independent and the value of the size effect exponent reaches a lower-bound value. In neither case a homogenous dislocation nucleation (as in Ref. [22] ) was observed.\nAlthough the size-effect exponent for particles with χ ≤ 0.7 is nearly constant, the absolute values of particle strength increase\nith increasing roundness. We compare particles of the same size\nut with different roundness levels at the onset of plasticity. One an see in Fig. 7 (e) that two particles with different roundness exibit nearly equal stress levels at the center of the top facet and t its edge (near the first surface step), where the first dislocaions nucleate at the onset of plasticity. Thus, similar stress levels ear the atomic steps are required to nucleate a dislocation there.\noreover, the characteristic width of the V-shaped stress peak at he first surface step does not depend on particle roundness. Howver, the area of the uppermost atomic layer of atoms is larger or larger χ , which results in a smaller average compressive stress n the whole facet for larger χ . More generally, while the local tress concentration is independent of shape and size, the mean ompressive stress exerted on the particle varies depending on the hape and size. Thus, we get a shape-effect in round particles with ncreasing strength as we increase the roundness level, but with he size-effect exponent remaining constant.\n. Discussion\n.1. Equilibration of sintered particle agglomerates\nThe densification of agglomerates of microparticles formed by cratching of the dewetted Mo film is a classical example of a sinering process. The role of crystal defects, stacking faults and GBs n the coalescence and sintering of metallic nanoparticles is well\nocumented by in-situ TEM and XRD experiments [41–44] , and by\nD simulations [45–47] . While the GB self-diffusion is responsible or densification, the change of the overall shape of the aggregate s controlled by surface diffusion. As for the GBs, the faceted shape\nf individual nano- and microparticles is promoting the formation f wide GBs at the onset of agglomeration because of the strong an der Waals attraction forces acting between the two faceted articles approaching each other with the parallel alignment of the wo nearest facets. However, the fast shape evolution of the aglomerates and formation of micrometer-sized equilibrated single rystalline particles is in apparent contradiction to the high stabilty of the non-equilibrium shape of the initial, smaller Mo particles ormed after the first dewetting annealing. Indeed, the rate of equiibration of microparticles by surface diffusion scales inversely with he fourth power of the particle radius [48] , which means that the quilibration of small initial Mo particles should be about one-two\nrders of magnitude faster than the shape evolution of much larger article agglomerates. We believe that a key to resolving this conradiction is a combination of the faceted shape of initial Mo paricles, and the GB migration during sintering of particle agglomrates. Indeed, Mullins and Rohrer demonstrated that the energy arrier associated with the formation of a disc-shaped nucleus of\nnew atomic layer on atomically flat facet is prohibitively high for he particles larger than a few nanometers in size [49] . Thus, once he faceted single crystal Mo particles are formed at the late stages f the solid-state dewetting they become stuck in their pancakeike, non-equilibrium shape, which is inherited from the thin film rom which they were formed. On the other hand, the large anle GB sweeping through the sintering agglomerate changes the rystallographic orientation of the shrinking grain. The facets that orresponded to the singular, low-energy surfaces in the shrinkng particle change their crystallographic orientation and become\non-singular, with the high concentration of steps conductive for arrierless shape-changing surface diffusion [ 29 , 30 ].\nAnother important question to ask in the context of sintering f particle agglomerates is why the large particles formed after ull sintering of agglomerates largely preserve the initial OR of he individual particles to the substrate. Indeed, most of the initu experiments on nanoparticles sintering were performed with\nonodispersed round particles on the TEM grid. Therefore, the\nc t r b o u f p s e\nt c t t w l s ritical role of the substrate and the preferred orientation of paricles on the coalescence was not addressed. The coalescence of andomly oriented copper particles on copper single crystal has een reported previously [ 50 , 51 ]. It was observed that randomly riented nanoparticles adopt the same orientation as the substrate pon heating by reorientation, which proceeds by neck formation, ollowed by the GB migration through the particle. Since in the\nresent case the initial particles are preferentially oriented to a apphire substrate, we argue that after scratch experiments sevral particles in the agglomerates are still connected and preferen-\nially oriented to the substrate. This orientation is stable because it orresponds to the minimum of Mo-sapphire interface energy and, herefore, the grains formed from these preferentially oriented paricles survive the grain growth and impose their orientation on the\nhole agglomerate. The possible mechanism involved in the coaescence of faceted nanoparticles on a sapphire substrate and subequent grain growth is shown schematically in Fig. 8 .\nStep 1: Initial scratch on the sample using a piece of clean sap-\nphire wafer creates agglomerates of particles near the edge\nh ( p d t s I M t\n4\ns t s t s T t c v t f a B s t a i b p r t fl c T l i i F t l t t a i (\nof the scratch. The particles adhere to each other along their facets. Step 2: With subsequent annealing, the adhered particles form\nthe GBs which expand by surface diffusion.\nStep 3: With further increase in annealing temperature and\nholding time, the agglomerates undergo densification by the GB diffusion followed by GB migration, grain growth, and reduction in the overall number of defects and pores. Step 4: Finally, at higher temperatures and longer holding time,\nthe particles eventually relax to a spherical or faceted shape, depending on the partial pressure of oxygen in the annealing ambient.\nThe proposed mechanism of overall coalescence and aggregation is consistent with the mechanisms proposed for aggregation of free-standing dispersed particles and particles on single crystalline substrates [ 41 , 50 , 51 ]. The proposed mechanism is also supported by our TEM data indicating that the sintered particle is single crystalline with no sign of GBs, pores, and defects (see Fig. 4 ). Moreover, the sintered particle exhibit faceted morphology and welldefined OR with the substrate (the same OR as observed for pristine particles).\n4.2. Evolution of particles morphology\nThe observed change in morphology of Mo particles at different flow rates of the forming gas can be related to the variation in oxygen partial pressure inside the furnace. Indeed, the change of the rate of gas flow resulted in the very different partial pressure of oxygen. Kim et al. [52] showed that during solid-state dewetting, the retraction rates of the Ni film on MgO in the different crystallographic directions strongly depend on the oxygen partial pressure in the annealing ambient. These changes were related to the different surface reconstructions, as confirmed by Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED). The change in the position of the adsorbed oxygen atoms caused the surface reconstruction of Ni, which in turn resulted in the anisotropy of surface energy and different retraction rates. Meltzman et al. [53] have shown the effect of partial pressure of oxygen P (O 2 ) on the equilibrium shape of Ni particles. The change in morphology and facet types was related to relative changes in surface energies induced by the presence of oxygen. We expected that Mo particles could behave similarly during sintering. The theoretical calculations and LEED measurements performed by Sierka et al. [54] show that the energy of the {211} surface can be very sensitive to the oxygen partial pressure. The energy of this surface decreases with increasing oxygen content in the annealing ambient, which is consistent with our observations. Direct comparison of the two observed morphologies reveals that the small\nigh-index facets in the particles annealed in the 200 sccm flow P (O 2 ) ≈10 −14 atm) “replace” the {211} facets which form in the articles treated in the 10 sccm flow ( P (O 2 ) ≈10 −12 atm). A more etailed discussion of the particles morphology is difficult because he experimental data on the full orientation dependence of the urface energy of Mo on the P (O 2 ) is not available in the literature. nterestingly, the morphology and facet orientations in our faceted\no particles are similar to the equilibrium crystal shape of Mo de-\nermined in the theoretical first-principles study [28] .\n.3. Compression strength of the particles\nIn our experiments, we demonstrated the giant compression trength of Mo nanoparticles and its dependence on the shape of he particles. As for the round Mo particle, the size-independent trength (which can be defined either as maximum RSS or MCP at he onset of plastic yield) is consistent with the size-independent trength reported recently for hemispherical Ag nanoparticles [55] . he FEA calculations indicated that the onset of plasticity is related o the homogeneous nucleation of dislocation loops beneath the ontact zone in a {112} < 111 > slip system and a size-independent alue of 20 ±1 GPa was found for the maximum RSS at yield. Thus, his size-independent high strength indirectly confirms the defectree, pristine nature of the Mo particles produced by the scratching nd agglomerate sintering method employed in the present work.\nased on the FEA simulations, the contact radius at yield is subtantial and is in the range of 0 . 35 R − 0 . 45 R , where R is the paricle radius. This contact region is wide enough to enable a relible estimate of the MCP, which also manifests itself in the sizendependent MCP value although the contact forces at yield differ\ny an order of magnitude between the smallest and largest comressed particles. The obtained value of maximum RSS at yield is emarkably close to the estimated (unresolved) shear strength at he onset of plastic deformation of Mo single crystal produced by oating zone electron beam melting technique, with the surface arefully prepared by electrochemical polishing (19.5 GPa [36] ). his strength is very close to the theoretical strength of Mo calcuated employing various theoretical models [ 56 , 57 ]. It is interestng to compare the value of MCP of round Mo particles obtained n the present work (44.7 GPa) with the MCP value for the round e nanoparticles determined by Han et al. (10.7 GPa [24] ). Since he theoretical strength of metals scales with their shear moduus, and both Mo and Fe exhibit BCC structure at room temperaure, we expect the ratio of the MCP values to be close to the raio of respective shear moduli (1.5, with the shear moduli of 120 nd 82 GPa for Mo and α-Fe, respectively). Yet the correspondng ratio of the MCP values for Mo and Fe is significantly higher 4.2). In our opinion, this demonstrates a high structural perfec-\nt c n H t f e fi b\ns ( t t\nt p c t n T r m c p t t\nt f s m r a p [ u T i [ w t m a n s w a c s e\nc s o i\np a r\no [ n p t v v t s o p [\nion of the Mo particles obtained by the two-stage dewetting proess, which involved intensive GB migration during the second anealing step. On the contrary, the round Fe particles studied by\nan et al. [24] were prepared by argon plasma evaporation, and\nhey may have incorporated excess vacancies and other growth deects during synthesis. It should be noted that formation of nonquilibrium point defects during sputtering deposition of thin Fe\nlms is well-documented [58] . These defects remain largely immoile at room temperature.\nAnother important finding is the ultra-high compressive trength of 46 GPa of the smallest studied faceted Mo particles with the top facet diameter of ~110 nm), which is also similar to he one found for the round particles. A direct comparison of the wo values can be made in two ways:\n- multiplying the uniaxial compression strength of faceted parti-\ncle by the Schmid factor for the {112} < 111 > slip system, yielding 21.6 GPa for the CRSS, similar to the maximum RSS value of 20 GPa for the round particle; - estimating the uniaxial compression strength of the round par-\nticle employing Hertz’s model, in combination with the FEA results (see Supplementary Information, Section S3), yielding the value of 44.7 ± 2.5 GPa for the MCP, close to the strength value of 46 GPa for the faceted particle.\nBoth our experimental data and the results of MD simulaions indicate that particles deformation prior to plastic yielding is urely elastic, confirming that an avalanche-type dislocations nuleation occurs during yielding. Thus, the values of strength obained in the present work represent the values of critical stress eeded to nucleate new dislocations in otherwise pristine crystal. his is very different from the high hardness values (about 50 GPa) eported for the Si nanoparticles, which deformed via dislocations-\nediated plasticity from the early stages of loading [35] . In this ase, the high hardness simply expresses the high resistance of the article to the applied load, related to the fact that the dislocaion loops in the deforming, flattening particle trapped between he hard punch and rigid substrate have nowhere to escape.\nThe strength obtained in the present work is not only higher han that of bulk Mo, but also exceeds the strength reported or FCC pristine particles fabricated by solid-state dewetting [ 3 , 6 ], ingle-crystalline nanowires [ 5 , 59 ] and micro whiskers of different\netals [60] . Furthermore, this value is much higher than the value eported for single-crystalline pristine pillars of Mo-rich Mo-Ni-Al lloy [34] and almost an order of magnitude higher than the comression strength of FIB-fabricated pillars with similar dimensions 61 , 62 ]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest value of niaxial compression strength reported for any metallic material. his value is higher than the maximum estimates of the CRSS durng nanoindentation of the well-annealed Mo-3Nb alloy (16.2 GPa) 63] , probably because of the flat punch employed in the present\nork produces more homogeneous stress distribution in the maerial than the Berkovich or spherical diamond tips. The experi-\nental results of the present work are summarized in Fig. 9 as n Ashby-type chart in which CRSS and the particle diameter are ormalized by the shear modulus G and the Burgers vector b , repectively. The data obtained for our Mo particles are compared\nith the data from the literature normalized by the respective G\nnd b values. The plot clearly shows that strength of our Mo partiles not only exceeds the strength reported for most of the metallic ystems, but is also comparable to the theoretical strength of Mo stimated using various atomistic models [56] .\nIt is interesting that extrapolating the MD data for the uniaxial ompressive strength of faceted (0.8 ≤χ≤1) particles to the dimenions of experimentally tested faceted particles yields the values f strength which are lower than those determined in the experment. This is surprising, since the MD results are obtained from\nerfect samples compressed at high strain rates. A similar discrepncy was reported earlier for Ni particles [6] . There may be several easons for this discrepancy:\n- The interatomic EAM potential for Mo employed in the present\nstudy may result in an inaccurate energy barrier for dislocation nucleation, an event which are characterized by large atom displacements from their equilibrium positions and is not part of the calibration parameters of the interatomic potential; - The native oxide film of several nanometers in thickness\npresent on the surface of the Mo particles studied experimentally may increase the energy barrier for dislocations nucleation. Indeed, Shin et al. have observed a significant increase in the yield stress of Au nanowhiskers upon their coating with thin conformal alumina layer [64] . This strengthening was attributed to the slowdown of surface diffusion caused by the coating. It was shown earlier that surface diffusion is a main factor controlling surface nucleation of dislocations [5] . Passivating metal surface with an oxide layer confines the movements of the metal surface atoms to the metal-oxide interface, which exhibits much lower diffusion coefficients and higher activation energy for diffusion compared to the free metal surface [65] . - The same native oxide film, which is elastically softer than the\nunderlying metal, may serve as a kind of soft “cushion” reducing stress concentration on the top facet. This effect was addressed previously by Kositski et al. [14] and Sharma et al. [6] .\nAlso, it is interesting that the normalized compressive strength f metal particles obtained by solid state dewetting (see Refs. 3 , 6 , 54 ], and the present work) is significantly higher than the ormalized compressive strength of faceted dislocations-free metal articles obtained by wet chemistry methods [66] . In our opinion, his is because the wet chemistry synthesis inevitably introduces acancies, vacancy clusters, hydrogen atoms from the aqueous enironment, and even organic molecules [67] into the growing crysal. These defects may be invisible in transmission electron microcope and the lattice image of the sample may convey a message f the dislocations-free crystal. At the same time, it is known that oint defects decrease the critical stress for dislocations nucleation 68] .\nt c r i m t\n5\nc\np d m\nD\nc i\nThe scaling relationship between compressive stresses at a catastrophic failure and diameter of faceted Mo particles clearly shows a power-law dependence with the exponent n ~ 1.0 as can be seen in Fig. 6 (c). This value is close to the size-effect exponents determined in the experimental compression tests of Au [3] and Ni [6] nanoparticles, and is significantly higher than the size-effect exponents reported in previous studies of the micropillars of refractory BCC metals [ 61 , 69 ]. This highlights the main differences between the mechanical behavior of nanoparticles and of micropillars. This difference is related to the different deformation mechanisms in each case. In pillars, sources from existing dislocations play the major role in the deformation. Screw dislocations play a much more prominent role in the deformation of BCC pillars than their edge counterparts. Unlike the edge dislocations which glide along the well-defined crystallographic planes, the motion of screw dislocations is not confined to any particular set of crystallographic planes. Further, due to the lack of closest-packed atomic planes in the BCC lattice, the screw dislocation cores are non-planar, so that their motion is driven by both glide and non-glide shear stress components of the stress tensor. Also, the mobility of screw dislocations is much lower than that of their edge counterparts due to higher Peierls barrier for screw dislocation in BCC metals [70] . Therefore, the single dislocation becomes the source of new dislocations, leaves behind dislocation debris and further interacts with other dislocation segments, forming Frank-Read sources. This self-multiplication leads to the formation of entangled dislocation structures within the sample and concomitant strain hardening. These differences in deformation mechanisms were identified as a main reason for the significantly lower deformation size-effect exponent determined during compression tests of FIB-machined Mo, Ta and W nanopillars (0.43), as compared to Au pillars (1.0) [ 69 , 71 ]. The similarity of the size effect exponents for the faceted Mo particles and their FCC counterparts indicates that the underlying plasticity mechanisms of nanoparticles are different from those of FIB-machined nanopillars. Indeed, experimental and computation studies of micro-compression of defect-free particles have shown that the onset of plastic deformation is controlled by the dislocation nucleation [ 3 , 6 ]. The models revealed that, depending on their shape, the strength of faceted defect-free metal particles is determined by the modalities of dislocation nucleation in the stress gradient, rather than by their atomic structure (FCC or BCC). The MD simulations performed in the present work captured qualitatively the size effect, but the strength level of the small particles was higher, and the size effect exponent was smaller than determined in the experiment. A similar difference in the exponents was observed in Ni particles [6] . The reason for this difference in the exponents may be an occasional presence of dislocation sources and other defects in the largest studied particles. It is well-known that the probability of finding a defect in the particle obtained by the dewetting technique increases with increasing particle size [72] . Recently it was proposed that when dislocations and their sources are introduced in the metal particles, their compression behavior becomes similar to that of FIB-machined pillars, exhibiting a size-effect which is controlled by the distribution of pinning points and length of dislocation sources [73] . Thus, while the behavior of small particles should be consistent with the results of our MD simulations, large particles containing random defects may exhibit a considerable drop in their strength. In this case, the overall size effect exponent determined for the particles of all sizes studied experimentally should be larger than that determined in MD simulations. It is interesting that the occasional presence of defects discussed above did not affect the strength (maximum RSS or MCP) of round particles. This is probably because the maximum stress in compressed round particle is achieved in a single point beneath the indenter, while in the faceted particle the stress concentration is observed at six corners of the top (011) facet. Thus,\nhe volume of material where the dislocation nucleation may ocur in the faceted particle is by a factor of six larger than in its ound counterpart. Therefore, the probability that a random defect s located in the close vicinity of the stress concentration point is\nuch larger in the faceted particles, which explains the drop in\nheir strength at large sizes.\n. Conclusions\nFrom the results of the present study, the following conclusions\nan be drawn:\n1 We developed a two-stage solid state dewetting process to fab-\nricate Mo micro- and nanoparticles on a sapphire substrate with the self-similar shapes approaching the equilibrium crystal shape of Mo. The single-crystalline Mo particles formed from a thin Mo film after the first dewetting treatment exhibited low aspect ratios and highly non-equilibrium shapes. The sample was scratched with a sharp piece of sapphire, resulting in formation of agglomerates of deformed particles. These agglomerates sintered into fully dense, equilibrated particles after the second annealing. 2 We demonstrated that the shape of the Mo particles formed\nafter the second annealing can be manipulated by varying the oxygen partial pressure in the annealing ambient. Round particles were formed when the oxygen partial pressure was low (10 −14 atm), whereas highly faceted particles emerged after annealing under higher oxygen partial pressure (10 −12 atm). 3 Both round and faceted particles were tested in compression\nand exhibited a deformation behavior that is typical of the plasticity controlled by dislocation nucleation: reversible elastic deformation up to very large strains of several percent, followed by a catastrophic plastic collapse. The faceted particles exhibited a strong size effect in compression, with the smallest particle (with an upper facet of 110 nm in diameter) reaching the giant uniaxial compression strength of 46 GPa. We employed the FEA calculations to determine the maximum resolved shear stress in the round particles at the onset of plastic yielding from the experimentally measured load-displacement curves. The obtained value (20 ±1 GPa) was size-independent, and consistent with the critical resolved shear stress of the faceted particles. The achieved absolute strength values were firmly within the range of the theoretical strength of Mo. 4 We performed the molecular dynamic simulations of compres-\nsion tests of Mo particles with varying degree of roundness. We observed the size effect in compression strength, with a size effect exponent decreasing with increasing roundness of the particles (in qualitative agreement with the experimental data). Also, the absolute value of the particle strength increased with increasing particle roundness. This was attributed to the nearly constant amplitude and width of the stress peak near the edge of the top facet (where the first dislocation nucleation event occurs), resulting in higher average stress in the case of more rounded particles exhibiting smaller top facet.\nThe results of this work confirm the assumption that the lastic deformation of metallic nanostructure is strongly shapeependent, and can be utilized for the design of ultra-strong\netallic components of sub-micrometer dimensions.\neclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing finanial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to nfluence the work reported in this paper.\nA\nN s\nS\nf\nR\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\ncknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank the Israel Science Foundation (grant o 617/19, AS, OK and ER, and grant No 1521/16, RK and DM) for\nupport of this work.\nupplementary materials\nSupplementary material associated with this article can be\nound, in the online version, at doi:10.1016/j.actamat.2020.07.054 .\neferences\n[1] J.R.

    "abstractText" : "The ability to process metallic samples at the sub-micrometer scale raised the strength limits of pure metals to the Giga Pascal (GPa) range. Here, we fabricated Mo nanoparticles with a giant compressive strength surpassing the previous strength records of metallic materials. Round and faceted particles were produced by manipulating the annealing atmosphere during two-stage solid-state dewetting of Mo thin films deposited on sapphire. The round particle underwent a huge elastic deformation before yielding abruptly. Using finite element analysis, we found that the resolved shear stress on a {112} 〈 110 〉 slip system beneath the punch reaches an enormous value of 20 ±1 GPa at yield, regardless of particle size. The faceted nanoparticles, contrarily, followed a “smaller is stronger” rule, with uniaxial compressive strength of up to 46 GPa for the smallest nanoparticles. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the size effect diminishes with increasing roundness of the particle edges. This work demonstrates how shape and size of particles can be manipulated to achieve giant strength. © 2020 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
