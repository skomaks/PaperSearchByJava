      "text" : "With the increasing challenges in energy demands and environmental concerns, the development of sustainable and clean energy as an alternative to fossil fuels has attracted considerable attentions [1–4]. Among various renewable energy projects, hydrogen is considered to be a substitute for fossil energy due to its environmental-friendly and highenergy-density advantages, and photocatalytic water splitting reaction is regarded as one of the most promising routes to obtain hydrogen energy [5–7]. Thus, the investigation of semiconductor based photocatalysts that can efficiently split water by harvesting inexhaustible and clean solar energy is the critical technique of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution [8,9]. Since the first report of TiO2 as a photocatalyst [10], many inorganic semiconductors such as metal oxide and sulfide have received wide attention in the area of photocatalytic H2 evolution [11–13]. The facile synthesis rout, controllable morphology and proper conduction-band (CB) position of these inorganic photocatalysts provide great opportunities for them to act as H2 production photocatalysts [14]. However, the large band gap energy of some typical inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts, such as the traditional TiO2, remains the bottleneck to satisfy the requirements of visible light applications, due to the low utilization of solar energy [15,16].\nCovalent-organic frameworks (COFs), as an emerging class of crystalline and porous materials assembled with pure organic molecules by\ncovalent bonds [17], have been employed in various areas such as gas adsorption [18], storage [19,20], catalysis [21,22] and energy-storage devices [23,24]. In more recent years, COFs have been recognized as new type photoactive organic materials for light-induced H2 evolution due to their advantages of low density, high surface area and tunable band gaps [25–27]. Especially 2D COFs obtained by Schiff base reaction usually exhibit broad light harvesting ability in visible-light region attributed to the absorbance of characteristic groups and large conjugation systems [28,29]. In addtion to these, the excellent water and acidbase stablity of COFs endow these materials with the broad attemption and application in various solution system [30–32]. As new type oganic photocatalyst, the photocatalytic H2 evoltuion rate of some COFs under visible light irridiation has been proved to be superior than that of traditional amorphous polymer photocatalysts and some single-component inorganic semiconductors [33]. However, it seems hard to further improving the H2 evolution activity of pure COFs by tuning their structures and band gaps that is mainly because the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is still very high in single component COFs [34,35].\nIn order to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electronhole pairs, introducing a second semiconductor with proper band positions to construct heterostructure materials is an effective strategy as confirmed in various photocatalytic systems [36,37]. Thus, combining the individual advantage of organic COFs and inorganic semiconductors\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118586 Received 17 September 2019; Received in revised form 29 December 2019; Accepted 1 January 2020\n⁎ Corresponding author.

All rights reserved.\nT\nto construct a hybrid heterostructure should be an effective way to boost the photocatalytic activity of COF-based materials. Because the advantages of visible-light harvesting activity, porous structure and band gaps controllable characteristics, COFs can act as excellent photosensor in composites to improve the light absorbance and utilization [38]. The intrinsic porous nature of COFs also allows the sufficient contact of water molecules and active centers in the surface of inorganic semiconductors. However, the interaction between inorganic components and organic COFs is normally very weak, which could block the effective transfer of photogenerated electrons in the heterostructure and thus limit their activities [39,40]. Although it is known that the existence of strong chemical bonds between two components in heterostructures could greatly improve H2 evolution activity [41,42], it is still a great challenge to tightly combine COFs and inorganic component together by strong chemical bonds.\nIn this work, for the first time, we combined organic COF and inorganic semiconductor TiO2 together by covalent bonds to construct a hybrid heterostructure photocatalysts for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution. An excellent visible-light harvesting TpPa-1-COF obtained by Schiff base reaction was chosen to covalently composite with −CHO group modified TiO2 by in situ reaction. The nano TiO2 and TpPa-1COF were tightly integrated together in the resulting hybrid materials for the connection of covalent bonds by the Schiff base reaction of −CHO group modified on the surface of TiO2 and –NH2 group in the reactant of TpPa-1-COF. The obtained a series of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF hybrid materials exhibit effective visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution with the maximum photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 11.19mmol g−1 h−1. This is approximately 5.3 and 3 times higher than that of the parent TpPa-1-COF and the composite without covalent connection between these two components, respectively. As the first attempt of constructing covalently connected COF-based hybrid materials, this work confirms the superiority of covalent bonds in hybrid heterostructure photocatalysts for the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges and the improved H2 evolution activity."

      "text" : "The schematic diagram describing the synthesis of the TiO2-TpPa-1COF hybrid materials is shown in Scheme 1. The TiO2 nanosheets were synthesized via a solvothermal method with HF treated tetrabutyl titanate as precursor [43]. The as-prepared nano TiO2 were further functionalized with −CHO by two-steps post synthetic modification method. First, a typical coupling agent, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), was selected to introduce organic groups on the surface of\nTiO2 nanosheets [44]. The APTES modified TiO2 (APTES-TiO2) was synthesized according to the reported method by adding APTES into a TiO2 ethanol suspension. Then, the separated and dried APTES-TiO2 was reacted with 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (Tp), one reactant of the synthesis of TpPa-1-COF, to obtain aldehyde-functionalized TiO2 (CHO-TiO2) by the reaction of Schiff base reaction between them. The final covalently bonded TiO2-TpPa-1-COF hybrid materials with diverse mass ratios were synthesized by adding CHO-TiO2 into the synthetic reaction system of TpPa-1-COF."

      "text" : "The images of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicate that the as-synthesized TiO2 exhibits nanosheet morphology with the length below 200 nm (Fig. 1a). After modification, APTES-TiO2 and CHO-TiO2 nanosheets appear thicker than pure TiO2 (Fig. S1 and S2). As shown in Fig. 1b, pure TpPa-1-COF shows a bird's nest-like morphology with the diameter approximately 1 μm. From the SEM image of TiO2-TpPa-1COF, it can be observed that some modified TiO2 nanosheets were uniformly embedded with TpPa-1-COF (Fig. 1c). The results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements further confirm that nano TiO2 and TpPa-1-COF were tightly integrated together and TiO2 nanosheets were bound by TpPa-1-COF layer in TiO2-TpPa-1-COF hybrid material (Fig. 1d and 1e). The lattice fringes of {101} plane of anatase TiO2 with the distance about 0.35 nm were also clearly observed. The images of element mapping show that N, O and Ti are densely and evenly distributed on the surface of the TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (Fig. 1f). The result of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) show that the average content of Ti is about 11.8 wt %, which is comparable to the theoretically calculated value of 12.3 wt % (Fig. S3).\nThe structure of the as-synthesized samples was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The results form PXRD confirm the obtained TiO2 is anatase structure and the structure without change after two-step modification (Fig. S4). As shown in Fig. 2a, the PXRD patterns of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF hybrid materials exhibit two intense peaks at 4.7° and 25.28°, corresponding to the reflection of the {100} plane of TpPa1-COF and the {101} plane of TiO2, respectively [45]. All the diffraction peaks of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF in Fig. 2a show good agreement with the corresponding simulated PXRD patterns of TpPa-1-COF and TiO2 demonstrating the successful synthesis of a series of hybrid materials. With the content of TiO2 increasing, the intensity of characteristic diffraction peaks from TiO2 was apparently enhanced and the peaks from\nScheme 1. Schematic illustration of the synthesis of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF hybrid material.\nTpPa-1-COF were decreased dramatically. In addition, the presence of characteristic peaks of TiO2 and TpPa-1-COF in the FT-IR spectra of a series of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF further confirms the successful synthesis of hybrid materials (Fig. 2b).\nThe permanent porosities of the as-synthesized samples were evaluated by N2 absorption and desorption experiments at 77 K. The absorption isotherms of TpPa-1-COF and TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) exhibit reversible type-I isotherms with adsorption hysteresis between adsorption and desorption curves (Fig. 2c). Pure TiO2 exhibits a low BET surface area of 48.1m2 g−1 attributed to the surface absorption which is similar to that reported previously [46,47]. The obtained BrunauerEmmett-Teller (BET) surface area of TpPa-1-COF was 541.7 m2 g−1, while the BET surface area of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF was decreased to be 474.9 m2 g−1 for the introduction of TiO2. The thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) under N2 atmosphere proved that the TpPa-1-COF and TiO2-TpPa-1-COF hybrid materials show thermal stability up to 400 °C (Fig. 2d), while TiO2 has no weight loss during the whole test. From the results of TGA, the weight ratio of CHO-TiO2 and TpPa-1-COF in TiO2TpPa-1-COF (1:3) was calculated to be 25.9:74.1 which is comparable to the experimental value (Fig. S5)."

      "text" : "To prove the successful two-step modification of TiO2 (APTES-TiO2 and CHO-TiO2) and the resulting covalent connection between TiO2 and TpPa-1-COF in hybrid material, we firstly conducted FT-IR measurement for these as-synthesized samples. As shown in Fig. 3a, the FTIR spectra of TiO2, APTES-TiO2 and CHO-TiO2 show the similar strong peaks around 495 and 3400−3500 cm−1 originated from Ti-O linkage and surface hydroxyl, respectively [15,48–50]. Compared with raw TiO2, the spectrum of APTES-TiO2 shows apparent new bands at 1633 and 2923 cm-1 assigned to the NeH vibration of –NH2 and −CH2 groups in APTES, respectively [49,51]. Furthermore, the peak at 925 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretch vibration of Ti-O-Si moieties formed by the condensation reaction of silanol groups in APTES and hydroxyl groups on the surface TiO2 nanoparticles [48]. Compared with the APTES-TiO2, the spectrum of CHO-TiO2 show two additional peaks at 1619 and 1453 cm−1 originated from C]N group and C]C of benzene ring skeleton in Tp, respectively. It is noteworthy that the peak at 1562 cm-1 from NeH groups of ATPEs-TiO2 disappeared in the FT-IR spectrum of CHO-TiO2, which further demonstrates Tp has been\nsuccessfully grafted on the surface of TiO2 by Schiff base reaction. The successful synthesis of CHO-TiO2 also can be proved by the absorption of C–H and C]O bonds in −CHO group appeared at 2923 and 1619 cm−1 (covered by C]N absorption), respectively [52].\nBecause CHO-TiO2 has been grafted with one reactant (Tp) of synthesizing TpPa-1-COF, it is reasonable to obtain covalently connected TiO2-TpPa-1-COF hybrid materials by in situ reaction of CHO-TiO2 and the reactants of TpPa-1-COF. We also prepared TiO2/TpPa-1-COF (1:3) in which TiO2 is unmodified and without possible covalent connection between components and the physical mixture (1:3) of CHO-TiO2 and TpPa-1-COF as control samples. The comparisons of UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) for TiO2-TpPa-1−COF and control samples were conducted. As shown in Fig. 3b, the DRS spectrum of TiO2-TpPa1−COF (1:3) shows effective expansion absorption with only one reflection edge, while both physical mixture (1:3) and TiO2/TpPa-1-COF (1:3) show apparent two reflection edges addressed at the reflection edges of TiO2 and TpPa-1-COF, respectively. This indicates the formation of a new hybrid material from in situ reaction.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum (XPS) analyses were carried out to study the surface chemical state of APTES-TiO2, CHOTiO2 and TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3). As shown in Fig. 3c, the XPS spectrum of the APTES-TiO2 in the C 1s region shows three peaks at 284.4, 284.9 and 286.7 eV corresponding to C-Si, CeC, and CeN bonds, respectively [53,54]. Compared with the APTES-TiO2, the XPS spectrum of CHOTiO2 appeared three new peaks at 285.4, 288.0 and 288.9 eV which are assigned to C]N, C]O and CeO bonds, respectively. The peak from CeO bond and C]N was disappeared in the XPS spectrum of TiO2TpPa-1-COF, which is in consistent with the keto form transformation in TpPa-1-COF and the grafted Tp section. The peak in the N 1s region of the TiO2-TpPa-1-COF can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 399.1 and 402.5 eV (Fig. 3d), which belong to CeN and N+ groups, respectively [54,55]. It is worth noting that the peak at 400 eV from NH2 groups in the spectrum of APTES-TiO2 disappeared in the spectrum of CHO-TiO2, which is in consistent with consumption of -NH2 group in the formation CHO-TiO2 and the resulting keto form of TpPa-1-COF\nwith NeH bond. As shown in Fig. 3e, the peaks at 533.3, 531.6 and 529.6 eV in O 1s XPS spectrum of APTES-TiO2 can be assigned to O-Si, O-Ti3+ and O-Ti4+ bonds, respectively [56]. As compared with the APTES-TiO2, both CHO-TiO2 and TiO2-TpPa-1-COF appear a new peak at 531.5 eV assigned to C]O bond [56–58]. The peak assigned to CeO appearing in the O 1s region of CHO-TiO2 disappeared in TiO2-TpPa1−COF (1:3), which is consistent with the previous C 1s spectrum. As shown in Fig. 3f, the Ti 2p peak of APTES-TiO2 spectrum can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 458.6 and 464.4 eV ascribed to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 spin-orbital splitting photoelectrons, respectively. For CHO-TiO2 and TiO2-TpPa-1−COF (1:3), the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks shifted to higher binding energy regions at 459.65 and 465.1 eV, respectively, due to the change of chemical state or coordination environment of Ti 2p [56]. The above analyses further confirm the successful two-step modification of TiO2 and the covalent connection between TiO2 and TpPa-1-COF components in hybrid materials."

      "text" : "The optical absorption and band structure of all samples were analyzed from the results of DRS and Mott–Schottky (MS) measurements. As shown in Fig. 4a, the TiO2 possesses an absorption edge at 400 nm. The optical absorbance of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) is similar to that of the pure TpPa-1-COF, and both of them have strong visiblerange absorption below 600 nm. The corresponding band gaps for TiO2, TpPa-1-COF and TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) were calculated to be 3.32, 2.07 and 2.15 eV, respectively [59–61]. The MS curves of all samples show positive slopes, an indication of typical n-type semiconductors (Fig. 4b). The flat band positions (Vfb) obtained from the results of MS for TiO2, TpPa-1-COF and TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) are -0.46, -0.93 and -0.82 V vs the saturated calomel electrode, respectively [4,62]. Since it is generally believed that the bottom of the conduction band (CB) in ntype semiconductors is approximately more negative by 0.10 V than the Vfb [63–65], the CB of TiO2 and TpPa-1-COF was estimated to be -0.32 and -0.78 eV, respectively. Combined with the band gap energy, the\nvalence-band (VB) positions of TiO2 and TpPa-1-COF are 3.0 and 1.3 eV vs. NHE, respectively, suggesting that TiO2-TpPa-1-COF hybrid material shows the type II heterojunction [66,67].\nBased on the above characterization results, the photocatalytic H2 production performance of these materials were evaluated under visible irradiation of 300W xenon lamp fitted with a cut off filter of 420 nm. Sodium ascorbate (SA) was selected as sacrificial agent and 3wt% Pt was used as a co-catalyst by photodecomposition according to the results of comparison experiments (Fig. S6). Under the above reaction conditions, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate for TpPa-1-COF is 2.1 mmol h−1 g−1, while no H2 was detected for pure TiO2 under the above condition for its poor visible-light responsiveness. Notably, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates for TiO2-TpPa-1-COF hybrid materials with the weight ratios (TiO2 : TpPa-1-COF) of 1:12, 1:6, 1:4, 1:3 and 1:2 are 4.36, 7.99, 8.06, 11.19, 2.54mmol h−1 g−1, respectively, which are all higher than that of TpPa-1-COF in the similar condition (Fig. 4c and Fig. S7). Especially, the H2 evolution rate of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) shows 5.3 times better than that of the parent TpPa-1-COF and is the best performance among the COF and TiO2-based photocatalysts\nreported previously (Table S1). Interestingly, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) hybrid material is approximately 3 and 4.6 times higher than that of TiO2/TpPa-1-COF (1:3) and physical mixture (1:3), respectively (Fig. 4d), which demonstrate covalent bonds connection between two components in hybrid materials play an important role in boosting the photocatalytic H2 evolution.\nTo evaluate the stable performance of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) hybrid material, cycling H2 evolution experiments were carried out for five times under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 4e, the H2 production rate has no obvious change during the five cycles measurements. The stability of hybrid material in photocatalytic process was further confirmed by PXRD and SEM measurements for the TiO2TpPa-1-COF (1:3) after photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S8 and S9). The similar morphology and crystalline of hybrid material before and after photocatalytic reaction demonstrate its durable stability during the photocatalytic process. Moreover, the wavelength dependence of apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for hybrid material was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 4f, the AQE under different wavelengths matches very well with its light absorption property, revealing that the\nreaction was really driven via light absorption by the catalyst. The AQE for TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) was calculated and reached 7.6 % at λ =420 nm. The AQE shows decreasing tendency in longer wavelengths region, achieving 6.8, 6.4, 5, 1.9 and 0.9 % at 450, 500, 550, 600 and 650 nm, respectively."

      "heading" : "2.4. Mechanism analysis",
      "text" : "To investigate the mechanism of hybrid material in photocatalytic H2 evolution, a series of measurements were carried out. The EIS Nyquist plots of TiO2, TpPa-1-COF and TiO2-TpPa-1-COF were conducted in the frequency range from 105 to 0.1 Hz (Fig. 5a). The semicircle in the Nyquist plot can be simulated well by a Randles electrical equivalent-circuit model. The results show that TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) has a much smaller semicircle radius than TpPa-1-COF and TiO2 indicates more efficient interfacial charge-carrier transfer in TiO2-TpPa-1COF (1:3) composite [68–70]. Further, experimental EIS data fitted to the equivalent Randle circuit using Zview software (Table S2). As shown in Fig. 5b, the photocurrent density of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) hybrid material is about 3.5 higher than that of TpPa-1-COF and TiO2, respectively, which could be attributed to the lower electron-hole pairs recombination and more efficient charge carrier migration.\nAs shown in Fig. 5c, the results of surface photovoltage spectroscopy\n(SPS) response also support the above view for the separation of photogenerated charges efficiency of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) is markedly improved. In addition, the photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra were carried out to reflect the transfer behaviors of photogenerated charge carriers. As shown in Fig. 5d, TiO2TpPa-1-COF (1:3) shows the lowest luminescent intensity in all samples, which should be attributed to the fast transfer of photogenerated electrons from TpPa-1-COF to TiO2, leading to the PL quenching and a reduced electron hole recombination. The results of time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra show the intensity-average lifetimes of TpPa-1-COF and TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) are 0.58 and 0.46 ns, respectively (Fig. 5e). This implies the introduction of TiO2 provides an additional decay channel of photogenerated electrons in hybrid material reducing the recombination of photogenerated charges. In order to calculate the electron transfer rate (kET), we assume that the PL lifetimes of the TpPa-1-COF and TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) are given by τTpPa1= 1/k and τTiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) = 1 / (k+ kET) and thus the kET can be calculated to be 4.3×108 s−1. This indicates the recombination of electron–hole in hybrid materials can be effectively suppressed.\nTo further confirm the role of covalent connection between two components in hybrid material, we further compared the EIS and PL spectra of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF with that of TiO2/TpPa-1-COF and the physical mixture (1:3) (Fig. S10 and S11). The results show that hybrid\nmaterial exhibits the smallest semicircular diameter of Nyquist curves and lowest PL intensity in these measurements. Thus, it can be concluded that the covalent bonds between two components in hybrid materials can really serve as a bridge to improve the separation of electron hole pairs and the transfer of photogenerated electrons in photocatalytic process. Besides, TiO2-TpPa-1-COF shows a contact angle of 13° which is apparently smaller than that of TpPa-1-COF (52°) (Fig. S14), indicating a more hydrophilic surface for TiO2-TpPa-1-COF.\nAccording to the above test results, the photocatalytic H2 evolution mechanism of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF can be speculated as shown in Fig. 5f. The component of TpPa-1-COF in hybrid material possesses excellent light absorbance ability and acts as a light-harvest role upon visible light irradiation. Although TiO2 does not have the ability to absorb visible light, its intrinsic conduction band position matches great well with the reduction of proton. Under visible light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons of TpPa-1-COF transfer from VB to CB and then the excited state electrons would more quickly transfer to the CB of TiO2 through covalently connected junction to make sure the opposite migration of photogenerated electrons and holes. The successfully separated electrons in the CB of TiO2 conduct the H+ reduction under the\nPt co-catalyst, and holes leaved in the VB of TpPa-1-COF are captured by SA."

The two-step modification of TiO2, APTES-TiO2 and CHO-TiO2, and the covalent connection between two components of TiO2-TpPa-1-COF hybrid materials were confirmed by various measurements. It was demonstrated that the tight integration of TpPa-1-COF and TiO2 can greatly improve the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity and the role of covalent bonds between two components of hybrid material was further confirmed by control experiments. The mechanism investigation demonstrate that the generated covalent bonds in hybrid material can really serve as a bridge in heterostructure to improve the separation of electron hole pairs and the transfer of photogenerated electrons in photocatalytic process.

In this work, for the first time, the TpPa-1-COF, an excellent visible-light harvesting covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), and TiO2 were combined together by covalent bonds to construct a heterojunction. The resulting TiO2-TpPa-1-COF hybrid materials show efficient photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. Especially, TiO2-TpPa-1-COF (1:3) exhibits the optimized photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 11.19 mmol g h and apparent quantum efficiency of 7.6 % at λ = 420 nm, which is 5.3 and 3.0 times higher than the TpPa-1-COF and TiO2/TpPa-1-COF, respectively. Further investigations confirm that the covalent connection between TiO2 and TpPa-1-COF components can largely improve the transfer of photogenerated charges of COF, leading to the efficient H2 evolution activity.",
