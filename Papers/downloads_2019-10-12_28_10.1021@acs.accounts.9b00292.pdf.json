As a functional group for targeted drug delivery, boronic acids (BAs) have been incorporated in polymeric particles both as a stimuli-responsive functional group and as a targeting ligand. Here, BA chemistry presents a wealth of opportunities for biological applications. It not only reacts with several chemical markers of disease such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glucose, and reduced pH, but it also acts as ligands for diols such as sialic acid. These stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems optimize delivery of therapeutics based on rational design and precise molecular engineering. When designing materials containing BA, the unique chemical properties are important to take into consideration such as its vacant p-orbital, its molecular geometry, and the designed acid’s pKa. Instead of behaving as most carboxylic acids that donate protons, BAs instead primarily act as Lewis acids that accept electrons. In aqueous solution, most polymers containing BA exist in an equilibrium between their triangular hydrophobic form and a tetrahedral hydrophilic form. The most common pKa’s are in the nonphysiological range of 8−10, and much ongoing research focuses on modifying BAs into materials sensitive to a more physiologically relevant pH range. So far, BA moieties have been incorporated into a stunning array of materials, ranging from small molecules that can self-assemble into higher order structures such as micelles and polymeric micelles, via larger polymeric assemblies, to large scale hydrogels. With the abundance of biological molecules containing diols and polyhydroxy motifs, BAcontaining materials have proven valuable in several biomedical applications such as treatment of cancer, diabetes, obesity, and bacterial infections. Both materials functionalized with BA and boronic esters display good safety profiles in vitro and in vivo; thus, BA-containing materials represent promising carriers for responsive delivery systems with great potential for clinical translation. The intention of this Account is to showcase the versatility of BA for biomedical applications. We first discuss the chemistry of BA and what to consider when designing BA-containing materials. Further, we review how its chemistry recently has been applied to nanomaterials for enhanced delivery efficiency, both as a stimuli-responsive group and as a targeting ligand. Lastly, we discuss the current limitations and further perspectives of BA in biomaterials, based on the great benefits that can come from utilizing the unique BA chemistry to enhance drug delivery efficiency."

      "text" : "The extensive versatility of boronic acid (BA) containing compounds has rendered it one of the most researched and used chemical functional groups for biomedical applications. Polymeric nanomaterial drug delivery systems (DDS) offer several great advantages such as prolonging blood circulation time, ease of surface modification, and targeting to site of action to increase the efficacy of traditional drugs. To improve drug accumulation at a site of action, two main strategies can be employed using DDS: (1) increasing the affinity between the DDS and the targeting site and (2) controlling the release of the drug utilizing pathology-specific triggers such as reduced\npH, overexpression of reactive oxygen species (ROS), or presence of specific proteins or carbohydrates.1 The chemistry behind BA allows this multifunctional group to be used for all these purposes.2−4\nBA acts as a Lewis acid, and its chemistry is highly dictated by its surrounding neighbors. BAs attached to carbon are cleavable by oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, whereas BAs bound to oxygen display an interesting differential hydrolytic stability.

In\naqueous media, BA (and BA-containing polymers) exists in an equilibrium between its neutral hydrophobic form and, after complexation with a hydroxide ion, as a hydrophilic hydroxyboronate anion (Scheme 1, top right). When the pH is higher than the pKa, boronate esterification is favorable. Inversely, a pH lower than the pKa induces hydrolysis and reverses the reaction. This reversible reaction with 1,2-cis-diols or 1,3 cis-diols to form boronic esters allows BA to be utilized as a pH responsive material or a diol-responsive material, reacting with molecules such as glucose and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).5−9 These properties are also the basis for utilizing BA materials for targeting. However, the most common pKa’s of BAs are in the nonphysiological range of 8− 10, and there is much ongoing research into modifying BAs into materials sensitive to the physiologically relevant pH range. Based on the reaction mechanism between BA and ROS, BA reacts quantitatively and selectively with H2O2 and ONOO − (Scheme 2).10,11 First, ROS acts as a nucleophile and coordinates the boron. After an electron rearrangement, the covalent bond between boron and R cleaves. Phenylboronic\nester (PBE) groups in particular have been used for fast release kinetics from polymers in an ROS dependent manner.12 Here, the phenyl groups are also cleaved from their matrix via a quinone methide rearrangement. Our group has developed several polymers and nanoparticle systems using PBE with the goal to increase specificity of drug delivery.13−16 Due to the stoichiometric consumption of H2O2 during the reaction, many of these materials demonstrate additive anti-inflammatory effects themselves.15\nThe purpose of this Account is to highlight some of the fascinating science that has been produced using BA-installed polymers; however, it has not been possible to cover all of the outstanding chemistry reported."

Many polymeric DDS have a hydrophobic core to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs and also assist in the driving force behind the DDS vehicle formation. Controlling the hydrophobicity of the polymer using stimuli is thus directly related to controlling DDS disassembly and cargo release. Broaders et al. modified the hydroxyl groups of dextran with 4-(hydroxymethyl)phenylboronic acid pinacol ester into a hydrophobic dextran form (Oxi-DEX, Figure 2A).20 The authors demonstrated that 90% of the particles degraded with 1 mM H2O2, switching the hydrophobic Oxi-DEX to hydrophilic dextran.

This technique allowed imaging of tumors, arthritis, and paw inflammation (Figure 2B,C). Visualizing biochemical changes associated with diseases is of great clinical importance, as it would allow earlier and more accurate diagnosis than structural imaging. In a series of experiments, Zhang et al. investigated the structure− property correlations of different PBEs conjugated to βcyclodextrin.21 By changing the feeding ratios of 4-phenylboronic acid pinacol ester to the cyclodextrins, they varied the number of conjugated PBEs, resulting in different H2O2 sensitivities and rates of hydrolysis. The slowest rates and lowest scavenging efficiencies were found for materials bearing PBE plus an ester groups. They also demonstrated the safety of these materials in vivo and in vitro, confirming the promising clinical potential of BA-bearing DDS."

Other groups then used this chemistry in polymer backbones for fluorescence imaging.22,23\nAnother strategy involves modifying aliphatic poly(carbonate)s with PBE.24 To enhance the release kinetics of these materials, we designed a ROS-responsive ketalcontaining polymer with a PBE pendant to accelerate polymer degradation by chemical amplification (Figure 3C,D).14 The PBE on the polymer backbone was removed by ROS, unmasking a carboxylate, which subsequently accelerated the ketal hydrolysis of the backbone. This resulted in an increased degradation kinetics up to 17-fold compared to a previously reported ROS-responsive ketal-containing polymer. Nanoparticles formed using this polymer as a ROS-responsive drug carrier released the entire cargo in 9 h in 10 mM H2O2. This system demonstrated the importance of a PBE pendant to enhance degradation kinetics as well as the specificity toward H2O2, two highly desirable properties for increasing DDS specificity."

Upon cleavage by H2O2, the activity of the therapeutic is recovered, which has been demonstrated using the proteins RNase A and angiogenin.25,26 The concept has also been adopted for conjugating drugs onto polymers via PBE linkers. Qiu et al. conjugated the anti-inflammatory drug naproxen onto PEG-polyacrylate block copolymers.27 They achieved mass percentage (wt %) conjugates of naproxen at different ratios ranging from 23% to 42%. The self-assembled micelles released 100% of the conjugated naproxen within 6 h using 1.8 mM H2O2 and 50% with 0.18 mM H2O2. We took this concept further by conjugating naproxen with a PBE linker to dextran (Figure 4).15 Conjugation of naproxen changed the water solubility of dextran and allowed the formation of nanoparticles (Nap-Dex). We achieved 87% drug conjugation, and the particles released 100% of the drug within 20 min in 10 mM H2O2. We then demonstrated the viability and drug efficacy of the Nap-Dex nanoparticles in vitro by evaluating the reduction of proinflammatory cytokine levels from inflammatory macrophages. The Nap-Dex particles decreased the cytokine levels (TNFα and IL-6) drastically, with superior results to free naproxen. We concluded that the increased efficacy from the Nap-Dex particles was in part mediated by consuming H2O2 during the ROS-responsive disassembly."

When stimuli disturb the hydrophobic core, the dissociation of the micelle triggers cargo release (Figure 5A). BAs have been utilized as a linker to create a hydrophobic core, for instance by attaching phenylboronic acids (PBAs) on the diols of dextran that facilitated self-assembled micelles.30,31 Under acidic pH, the micelles disassembled and the cargo was released. Li et al. cross-linked two types of PEG-cholic acid dendrimers (telodendrimers); one had a PBA block between a PEG (5k) and a cholic acid dendrimer (CA) (PEG5k-NBA4-CA8), and the other block copolymer had a catechol block instead of the PBA (PEG5k-catechol4-CA8) (Figure 6A).32 The micelles formed by these telodendrimers cross-linked via a BA-diol interaction. By tuning the number of BA and catechols in the telodendrimers they optimized the stability of the micelles and tuned the pKa for disassembly at different pH-values. Zhao et al. utilized the biocompatible dextran as their base for cross-\nlinking a hydrophilic micelle shell using BA-diol, and subsequently demonstrated pH-responsive controlled release (Figure 6B).33 The amphiphilic block copolymer, dextranblock-polylactide (Dex-b-PLA) was synthesized by a click reaction between α-alkyne dextran and α-azido PLA. The hydroxyl groups of Dex-b-PLA were further modified with a 3- carboxy-5-nitrophenylboronic acid (CNPBA). The shell was cross-linked via BA between CNPBA and the diols on Dex-bPLA and enabled doxorubicin release at pH 5.5−7.4. These were loaded with drug using a simple dialysis (solvent exchange) system, resulting in a DDS platform that suggested good scalability for clinical use."

This was a reversible reaction based on pH levels, where the hydrogels formed with rapid kinetics immediately after the mixing and liquefied in acid addition (pH 5.0). Heleg-Shabtai et al. employed gossypol both as a cross-linker and a therapeutic.37 Gossypol, a natural phytochemical pigment with potential antineoplastic anticancer activity, has two 1,2- diols in the molecular structure.

During synthesis, the BTZ conjugation ratio could be increased by modifying the pH, from 0% at pH 5.5, to 60% at pH 8.5.

The rate of release could be tuned by varying the pH or the concentration of glucose in the environment. The combination of two stimuli led to an enhanced release capacity in mild acidic conditions (pH 6.0). Similarly, the silica surface can be directly modified using BAs without a polymer coating. Utilizing the pH-responsive interaction between BA and catechol functionalized cyclodextrin prevented undesirable drug leakage from the BA modified silica particles and controlled release.45 As one of the drawbacks of mesoporous silica particles is leakage and uncontrolled release of cargo, these studies show how utilizing BA as surface coating could be a viable strategy to stabilize the material for further use as DDS."

The study demonstrated that glycine installed on the polymer both reduced the pKa of the PBA as well as enhanced the specificity toward glucose.

These nucleophiles exist either in the aforementioned diol-containing molecules or as residues in disease-associated proteins (Figure 11A). BA-containing constructs can thus be used to interfere with signaling pathways, inhibit enzymes, as well as target glycoproteins for enhanced nanoparticle uptake.51 However, the biggest hurdles to overcome are (1) the binding affinities for the selected target and (2) maintaining a pKa in the physiological range. Several strategies to manipulate the binding affinity have been investigated, where four common BAs show biocompatible binding pH.3 These are schematically represented in Figure 11B and include (1) PBAs with electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl, fluoro, or carbonyl groups on the phenyl ring, (2) BAs containing intramolecular tetracoodinated B−N or B−O bonds, so-called Wulff types, (3) BAs containing intramolecular tricoordinated B−O-bonds (improved Wulff types), and (4) heterocyclic BAs. Wulff-type BAs supply the boron with intramolecular coordination between the boron and a nitrogen, or the boron and an oxygen atom, which decrease the pKa.\n8 A further strategy is to utilize intermolecular coordination between the boron and different installed groups on the polymer backbone. Such strategies simultaneously lower the pKa as well as provide multiple binding opportunities to enhance binding specificities toward the targeted molecule. Examples of sugars that can be targeted are depicted in Figure 11C. Much inspiration in developing targeting molecules for DDS can come from the ever expanding field of BA-based molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs; reviewed by Liu and He3).

Terminal saccharides such as sialic acid play crucial roles in cell signaling, and overexpression is closely associated with a hyperactivated state, such as in cancer and immunity.58 Detecting these hyperactivated states assists in monitoring, analyzing, and controlling cancer cells; however, effective and selective recognition remains challenging. To increase binding, Otsuka et al. established a stronger and more selective binding between sialic acid and PBA by forming intramolecular B−N or B−O bonds (Wulff types described in section 5 and Figure 11B, structure 2), with the glycerol side chain of sialic acid (Figure 12A).59 They compared the\nequilibrium constant (K) for sialic acid binding to their model 3-(propionamido)phenylboronic acid (PAPBA) with glucose, mannose, and galactoseother major biological carbohydrate constituents of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Their system displayed a 7 times higher binding affinity for sialic acid than for glucose at physiological pH. This complexation of PBA and sialic acid at neutral pH has enabled cancer cell detection, drug delivery, and separation of cancer cells (recently reviewed by Xiong et al.60). To target SA for drug delivery in cancer, Zhao et al. developed a PBA-terminated block copolymer micelle (Figure 12B).61 Their construct bound fructose stronger than SA at\nneutral pH, whereas in the acidic tumor microenvironment the fructose/PBA complex was unstable. They thus creatively covered their micelles with fructose for drug delivery in a murine tumor model as a way to avoid unspecific binding. This strategy effectively increased drug delivery specificity toward cancer cells. To further increase nanoparticle binding to tumors cells, a multivalency approach offers enhanced specificity and affinity. Utilizing both PBA−sialic acid interactions, as well as chondroitin-sulfate−CD44 receptor interaction, was shown to enhance antitumor activity of doxorubicin (Figure 13).62 By\nfurther coupling a Cy5.5 fluorescent probe to the formed NPs, these NPs were also shown to work as a diagnostic agent.

The advantages of BA materials are numerous, including biocompatibility, rapid response rates, and long-term stability. Pinacol-type boronic ester groups have so far been shown to be the most sensitive and selective probe for physiologically relevant H2O2 concentrations. The release kinetics can be controlled by sophisticated material designs, such as chemical amplification strategies. The reaction between BA and ROS is quantitative and is influenced by the pH of the microenvironment. Therefore, utilizing BA as a drug conjugation linker presents an effective strategy to control drug release in response to specific amounts of ROS, correlating to disease activity. The unique ability of BAs to bind to diol-compounds reversibly at physiological pH enables binding in biologically relevant applications. Particularly for binding saccharides and glycoproteins, there remain several unexplored applications for BA polymers. Glycan molecules modulate many processes important for cell and tissue differentiation, metabolic and gene regulation, protein activity, migration, invasion, and more.

With new methods of controlled synthesis and simple one-step analysis and translatability, BA polymeric materials will find wide use in clinical applications.\n■ AUTHOR INFORMATION Corresponding Author\n*E-mail: nanomedicine@ucsd.edu."
