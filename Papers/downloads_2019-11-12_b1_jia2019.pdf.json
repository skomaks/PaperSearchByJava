The development of efficient and affordable electrocatalysts plays a key aspect in energy conversion processes by lowering the reaction kinetic barriers and thus boosting the efficiency and selectivity of diverse electrochemical reactions (e.g., oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen and carbon dioxide reduction reactions). Recently, defect engineering has emerged as a new strategy for tailoring the electronic structures and interface coordination; however, the role of ‘‘defect’’related sites in as-designed electrocatalysts has not yet been fully understood. In this review, we will shed light on the recent advances in tailoring nanomaterials from the aspects of constructing defect-based motifs as active sites for versatile electrochemical energy conversions as well as their underlying mechanism on structure-property correlations.\nThe development of advanced catalysts for efficient electrochemical energy conversion technologies to alleviate the reliance on fossil fuels has attracted considerable interest in the last decades. Insight into the roles of reactive sites in nanomaterials is significant for understanding and implementing the design principles of nanocatalysts. Recently, the essential role of defects, including vacancies, reconstructed defects, and doped non-metal (or metal)-defect-based motifs, have been widely demonstrated to promote the diverse electrochemical processes (e.g., O2 [or CO2] reduction reactions and H2 [or O2] evolution reactions). Nevertheless, the in-depth exploration of the underlying defect electrocatalytic mechanism is still in its infancy. This review summarizes the state-ofthe-art defect engineering strategies for designing highly efficient electrochemical nanocatalysts with special emphasis on the correlation between defect structures and electrocatalytic properties. Finally, some perspectives on the challenges and future research directions in this promising area are presented."

      "text" : "With the increasing depletion of resources and environmental concerns, electrochemical energy conversion technologies are regarded as promising pathways for developing clean energy devices.1,2 The core of these clean energy devices involves a series of electrochemical redox couples, for instance, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the air electrodes of regenerative fuel cells or rechargeable metal-air batteries, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER at the cathode and anode of a water-splitting electrolyzer, and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for producing industrial chemicals and fuels. 3 Electrocatalysts play a vital role in the above energy conversion processes because they can lower the reaction kinetic barriers and thus boost the efficiency and selectivity of the chemical transformations involved.4,5 However, the current scope of catalysts utilized for these fundamental electrochemical reactions is dominated by precious-metal-based materials, such as platinum (Pt)-based catalysts for ORR and HER, iridium (Ir)- and ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts for OER, and gold (Au)- and silver (Ag)-based catalysts for CO2RR, significantly limiting their practical and largescale deployment as a result of cost and scarcity.3,6,7\nOn the basis of the electrocatalytic reaction principles, gas-involving electrochemical reactions occur at the triple-phase boundary regions of solid electrocatalysts, liquid electrolyte, and gaseous reactants and intermediates, where electrons, ions, and molecules can transfer at catalytic active sites.8 In this regard, in the last decade, the development of a new generation of electrocatalysts has mainly focused on manipulating the components, sizes, porosity, and interface structures of the materials to promote multiple-proton-coupled electron transfer and mass transportation in electrocatalysis.9–11 Recently, defect electrocatalysis has emerged as a new perspective and attracted extensive research attention, which is based on the\nChem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019 ª 2019 Elsevier Inc. 1371\nexperimental and theoretical evidences that solid electrocatalysts (e.g., metal oxides, carbides, transition-metal dichalcogenides [TMDs], zeolites, and carbons) containing defects can exert a positive impact on reactivity and selectivity in ORR, OER, HER, and CO2RR. 12–16 Different from a perfect lattice surface, defective sites usually present unique electronic properties that are particularly important to electrocatalytic reactions, where they can bind some reaction intermediates just properly to deliver an optimized activity and selectivity. Remarkably, the defects can not only alter the surrounding electronic structure but also serve as the ‘‘docking’’ site to trap the atomic metal species and form a new synergetic coordination structure as the active sites. Therefore, it is essential to get in-depth insight into the role of defective sites in nanomaterials for electrocatalytic energy conversion processes, which would be particularly important to guide the design of ideal catalysts.\nIn this review, we start with a brief introduction of defect theory for the design principles of electrocatalysts by encompassing defect types, synthetic strategies, and electronic structure regulations. Afterward, we summarize recent advances in tailoring nanomaterials from the aspects of constructing defect-based motifs as active sites for versatile electrochemical energy conversions. In particular, we discuss the structure-performance relationship in the field of electrocatalysis, which might provide guidance for the rational design of defective nanomaterials with a superior catalytic performance. Finally, we propose the current issues and opportunities in defect engineering at the atomic level to suggest future research directions on defect electrocatalysis.\n1School of Environment and Science, Queensland Micro- and Nanotechnology Centre, Griffith University, Nathan Campus, Queensland 4111, Australia 2Rowland Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA 3Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX 77005,"

      "text" : "The key issue in the field of electrocatalysis is the ability to recognize and understand the relationships between reaction intermediate adsorbed states on actives sites (microscopic level) and reaction kinetics (macroscopic property).3,8 Defects present widely in nanomaterials are commonly recognized as the active sites for electrocatalytic processes because of the tuned electronic and surface properties in the local region.13,17–19 For instance, the electronic state is significantly enhanced at the topological defect region (e.g., the combination of carbon rings with pentagonoctagon-pentagon, denoted as D585) as compared with normal hexagon sites in defective graphene (DG).20,21 This has been proved by a combination of experimental results and theoretical calculations, which have indicated that active sites for different electrochemical reactions (ORR, OER, and HER) are induced by specific defect types as a result of particularly desired reactant binding energy for each electrochemical reaction.22 In addition, the band gaps or electronic states near the Fermi level of most two-dimensional (2D) TMDs can be tuned through crystal strain, which can be induced by defects at the edges or basal plane.23 Therefore, defect engineering has been widely adopted for fabricating nanomaterials to boost their electrocatalytic reactions.13,17–19 Nevertheless, controllable defect engineering methods are essential for the precise study of defects and their roles in reaction mechanisms. Doing so is practically expedient for gaining more insight into electrocatalyst design principles for a specific catalytic process.\nUSA 4State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, P.R.

      "text" : "According to the dimensions, defects in solid nanomaterials can be classified into four main categories: zero-dimensional (0D) point defects (e.g., vacancy, reconstruction, and doping), one-dimensional (1D) line defects (e.g., dislocation), 2D planar defects (e.g., grain boundary), and three-dimensional (3D) volume defects (e.g., spatial lattice disorder). In this review, we mainly concentrate on the point defects\n1372 Chem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019\nbecause they are the elementary motifs for endowing the functions of defect-based electrocatalysts from the multi-dimensional scope. Point defects can be further subdivided into three representative configurations in metal compounds or non-metal materials: (1) reconstructed or vacancy defects, (2) non-metallic-atom-doping (such as N, S, B, and P)-induced defects, and (3) metal-defect coordination structures (Figure 1).\nCorrespondingly, diverse approaches have been experimentally developed to fabricate such defect-based motifs in nanomaterials, which can be mainly classified into post-functionalized methods and in situ synthesis. With respect to post-functionalized methods, ball milling is an efficient and cost-effective approach to creating and exposing a large amount of reconstructed and vacancy edge defects. For example, Deng and co-workers demonstrated that the size reduction of graphite nanosheets by simple ball milling can significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activation of oxygen, which originates from the reconstructed oxygen-defect motifs on zigzag edges.24 It is also noteworthy that the plasma technology with good controllability (e.g., Ar, O2, and/or N2 plasma source type, power density, and processing time) is another promising approach to obtaining uniformly vacancy defects in carbon- or metal-compound-based nanomaterials.25,26 Furthermore, the obtained defect structures in carbons, transition-metal oxides, and TMDs (e.g., MoS2 and CoSe2) can be further processed by non-metal- and metal-atom doping to form various dopant-defect coordination motifs to not only stabilize the topological structures of defects but also further manipulate the local electronic distribution through the diverse coordinated configurations.27,28 Analogous to plasma technology, a high-pressure hydrogenation process has been recently reported to treat a 2D iron-cobalt oxide (Fe1Co1Ox) via controllable hydrogen pressure and annealing temperature with the purpose of tuning its oxygen vacancy density.29 Moreover, the acidic etching of metallic nanoparticles anchored at the defect sites is another post-treatment approach to obtaining metal-defect motifs at the atomic level.30,31\nChem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019 1373\nImportantly, in the post-functionalized strategy, the construction conditions of defect engineering (e.g., defect type and density) should be considered, which is not only beneficial for generating expected defective centers with optimal amount but also important for selecting suitable non-metal and metal species as guest dopants for defect modification.\nAlternatively, the in situ synthetic strategy is a bottom-up pathway for tuning the type and density of intrinsic defects during the construction of defect-based motifs in various nanomaterials, including template-based carbonization,32 dopantremoval annealing,22 pyrolysis of Zn-contained metal-organic frameworks,33,34 and electrochemical activation.35 Specifically, Zhang and co-workers synthesized a series of nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) meshes (NGMs) with different abundances of topological defects byMgO-templated carbonization of carbon and nitrogen precursors.31 Yao and co-workers introduced different types of topological defects into the graphene lattice via the removal of intentionally doped heteroatoms at a high temperature; afterward, the aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy directly demonstrated the various defects (pentagons, heptagons, and octagons) on the edge of the DG sheet at the atomic scale.22 Yao and co-workers carbonized a Znenriched metal-organic framework (IRMOF-8) and obtained a highly porous defective carbon because the containing Zn could be removed completely at 950 C.33 Following this evaporated Zn-induced defect scenario, doping Zn cations in other metal-contained MOFs (e.g., ZnCo-MOF) can exert the ‘‘fence’’ function to spatially expand the distance of adjacent Co atoms. Thus, after pyrolysis, the induced vacancy defects due to the evaporated Zn nodes can in situ preferentially coordinate with Co nodes to form a stable Co-N-C defect motif.34 In addition, electrochemical activation can also be utilized to create defect sites in carbon-based materials given that partial amorphous carbon can be oxidized and removed, resulting in simultaneous formation of atomic metals fixed by surrounding N-C defect sites in the process of wet chemistry.35"

      "text" : "Unraveling diverse descriptors of catalytic reactivity is essential for quickly screening catalysts for a given reaction. It has been demonstrated that the apparent rate of an electrocatalytic reaction is strongly related to the intrinsic electronic structure (e.g., d-band position for metal compounds, valence orbital level for non-metals, andwork function) of an electrocatalyst, which acts in determining the intermediate adsorption energetics, activation energies, and reaction energy barriers in specific electrochemical reactions.4,36,37 For instance, both theoretical calculations and experimental data have revealed that topological point defects in the basal plane of graphene can lead to opening a band gap or generating more electronic states near the Fermi level in comparison with the perfect graphene (the p and p* bands near the Fermi level are doubly degenerate) (Figure 2A).17,18,22 Analogous to carbon materials, in defective metal compounds, such as MoS2 with S vacancies, band structure can be stepwisely tuned by varying concentrations of S vacancies, leading to the reduction of the hydrogen adsorption free energy (DGH) (Figure 2B). 38 With regard to non-metallic-dopant-induced defect motifs, Zheng and co-workers selected six non-metallic heteroatoms with various electron electronegativities (N and O act as electron acceptors for the adjacent C, whereas F, S, B, and P act as electron donors) to investigate their effects on the adjacent C atoms, which act as the active sites for HER. The authors proposed that carbon-defect-based motifs via diverse coordination with multiple dopants can finely tailor the local charge populations in graphene matrix (Figure 2C).39 Furthermore, Xia and co-workers proposed a novel activity descriptor by considering the synergistic effect of electronegativity and electron\n1374 Chem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019\n(A) Three types of topological carbon defects and their electronic density of states.

On the other hand, the location of the multiple heteroatom dopants in a carbon matrix is also essential. Zhao and co-workers reported that two kinds of B- and N-co-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) dominated by the bonded or separated B and N have been intentionally prepared by chemical-vapor-deposition growth or after treatment, respectively, demonstrating distinct ORR performances (Figure 2E).41 The authors revealed that inertness of the bonded B- and N-co-doped CNT can be ascribed to the fact that the lone-pair electrons from the N dopant are largely neutralized by the vacant orbital of B dopant, and few electrons or vacant orbitals are left to conjugate with the carbonp system.41With respect to this viewpoint, Zheng and co-workers found that the C bridge site plays a synergetic role among various B-C-N configurations in a graphene matrix with B active sites as a function of the distance to a pyridinic N atom, and the strength of the synergistic effect decreases gradually as the distance between the B and pyridinic N dopants increases (Figure 2F).42 Besides non-metallic dopants, the presence of defects on supports can also act as the ‘‘docking’’ sites to capture atomic metal species for the formation of unique metal-defect coordination motifs to enhance catalytic performance. Particularly, the vacancies on the supporting matrix not only can trap the diverse metal species at atomic scale depending on the geometric structures of defects but also can finely tune the electronic structures of the centered metal atoms via different surrounding configurations. Wu and co-workers synthesized atomically dispersed Cu-N-C coordinationmotifs with high density in a NGmatrix by pyrolysis of copper phthalocyanine and dicyandiamide.43 The atomic-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images show that embedded Cu atoms render the surrounding N and C atoms electronically rich (Figures 2G and 2H). Bader charge distribution of different Cu-N-(C) coordination motifs shows that the variable chemical valence states of the Cu atom coordinated with different numbers of N atoms (Figure 2I), and the corresponding volcano plot of the relationship between ORR activity and DEO indicates that the optimal Cu-atom-modulated NC defect motif for ORR is Cu-N2 (Figure 2J). In brief, the electronic structures of defect sites can be artificially tuned by vacancy, non-metallic, or metallic dopants to achieve the optimal binding energy of various adsorbed intermediate states for specific electrochemical reactions."

Yao and co-workers introduced different types of topological defects into the graphene lattice by removing intentionally doped heteroatoms. The aberration-corrected HRTEM image (Figure 3A) directly shows various defects (pentagons, heptagons, and octagons) on the edge of the graphene\nChem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019 1377\nat the atomic scale. Compared with the NG, the DG exhibited enhancedORR activity (Figure 3B) due to a change in the charge and spin distributions in the DG and adsorption energies of the intermediates on active sites.22 Moreover, Yao and coworkers found that diverse configurations of topological carbon defects are distinctively appealing to different electrochemical reactions (ORR, OER, and HER) as a result of specific modulated electronic structures. To clarify whether the edge defects serve as the active sites for ORR, Wang and co-workers developed a microelectrochemical testing apparatus to investigate the ORR activity at the edge and the basal-plane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) (Figure 3C).49 Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was recorded at the specified location where the air-saturated droplet was deposited and indicated an appreciably higher ORR activity at the edges of HOPG with respect to the basal plane (Figure 3D). To further increase the edge defect density, Hu and co-workers tailored the extrinsic microstructure of the defective CNMs by employing carbon nanocages (CNCs) with abundant holes and edges (Figure 3E).50 As a result of the existence of substantial defect sites, CNCs delivered superior ORR activity compared with that of N-doped CNTs (Figure 3F). Remarkably, CNCs with the highest defect density from the Raman spectra (Figure 3G) showed the best electrochemical ORR activity (Figure 3H). At the level of intrinsic electron structure, all the factors (defects, edges, and dopants) that induced the modification of charge and spin distribution in the carbon matrix could effectively tune the adsorption energies of the intermediates, leading to enhanced ORR performance. With these multiscale fundamentals of catalyst design, Zhang and co-workers developed a NGM by synergistically combining the merits of doping, defects, and morphology regulation.51 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images clearly showed that the hierarchically porous NGMs were assembled by ultrathin graphene flakes with a lateral size of z250 nm (Figure 3I). The authors conducted density functional theory (DFT) investigations to systematically study the roles of dopants, edges, and defects for both ORR and OER. The calculations revealed that a nitrogen-free configuration with adjacent pentagon and heptagon carbon rings exhibits the lowest overpotential for both ORR and OER at the peak of volcano plot, indicating that the reconstructed defects (compared with N-doped-based motifs) could serve as the optimal active sites for ORR and OER (Figure 3J). Experimentally, such defect-rich NGMs exhibited excellent bifunctional ORR and OER activities, including a potential gap (DE) as low as 0.90 V (Figure 3K) and stable durability as tested in a primary Zn-air battery (Figure 3L).\nHigh-performance ORR catalysts in acidic electrolytes are more significant than those in alkaline environments because commercial proton-exchange membrane FCs (PEMFCs) prefer to operate in acidic media. Although modified CNMs show activities comparable to those of Pt in alkaline electrolytes, they are still not desirable in acidic media because the Gibbs free energy in the ORR process under acidic conditions is higher than that in alkaline conditions.46,47,52 To this end, Li and co-workers developed a defective N- and S-co-doped carbon aerogel (NSCA) fabricated from carrageenan (seaweed extract) through a two-step annealing method, which successfully introduced structural defects into 3D hierarchical porous carbon aerogels to generate atomic N-S-C-defect-based motifs (Figures 4A and 4B).53 The NSCA exhibited superior ORR activity in 0.1 M HClO4 solution, in which the half-wave potential was only 26 mV lower than that of Pt/C commercial catalyst with higher current density (Figure 4C). First-principle calculations based on DFT revealed activity origins of the atomic N-S-C-defect-based motifs in NSCA for acidic ORR (Figures 4D and 4E). Particularly, the N-S-D-G-6 and N-S-D-G-4 sites (Figure 4D) presented lower overpotentials of 0.15 and 0.40 eV, respectively, in acidic condition (pH = 0) than Pt/C (0.45 eV), whereas the S-G site without defect modification still required\n1378 Chem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019\n(A) Schematic synthetic route of defective NSCA from carrageenan (seaweed extract).

This work indicates themultiscale synergy of doping, microstructure, and defect engineering, which might open a new route toward designing and developing low-cost, large-scale, metal-free carbon ORR catalysts in acidic electrolytes.\nBesides non-metallic-dopant-induced defect motifs in CNMs for efficient ORR, transition-metal-N-C-defect-based coordination sites (M-Nx-C, M = Fe, Co, Mn, etc.) in CNMs have also been regarded as the most promising substitutes for Pt-based catalysts.34,35,54,55 Li and co-workers reported stable Co single atoms on nitrogendoped porous carbon (Co SAs/N-C) with precise Co-N coordination in carbon defects. The dominant active centers for Co SAs/N-C formed at 800 C and 900 C can be defined as planar Co-N4 and Co-N2, respectively. 34 The Co SAs/N-C with a Co-N2 center exhibited higher ORR activity than commercial Pt/C and Co SAs/NC with Co-N4 in an alkaline solution as a result of a stronger interaction with peroxide on Co-N2 sites to promote 4e for ORR (Figure 5A). Zelenay and co-workers reported an iron-nitrogen-carbon ((CM+PANI)-Fe-C) derived from cyanamide (CM) and polyaniline (PANI) with atomically dispersed Fe-N4-C-defect-based motifs and hierarchical porosity.54 This catalyst exhibited an excellent performance in a rotating ring-disk electrode (RDE) test in 0.5 M H2SO4 (Figure 5B). The authors revealed that the catalytic active sites were carbon-embedded Fe-N4 sites, which were directly visualized by AC-STEM characterization (Figure 5B). Noticeably, albeit Fe (or Co)Nx-C-based motifs as the ORR active sites have been theoretically and experimentally proved, they still suffer from insufficient durability, especially at the desirable high voltages (>0.6 V), which limits their practical applications in PEMFCs.56 The reasons of ORR activity degradation could originate from (1) the dissolution of active metal sites due to surrounding corrosion of amorphous carbon, (2) the protonation of the dopedN neighboring the active metal sites followed by anion adsorption, and\nChem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019 1379\n(A) LSV comparison curves of Co SAs/N-C (900) with Co-N2, Co SAs/N-C (800) with Co-N4, Co NPs/N-C, and Pt/C.

More importantly, the 20Mn-NC-second catalyst exhibited more durable stability than the 20Fe-NC-second catalyst at a constant potential of 0.8 V for 100 h in O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4, suggesting that Fenton reactions involving Mn ions are insignificant because of weak reactivity between Mn and H2O2 (Figure 5E). Furthermore, the 20Mn-NC-second catalyst was fabricated as a cathode in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for H2-O2 practical fuel cell applications, which can achieve the optimal power density of 0.46 W cm 2 at 1.0 bar partial pressure.55\nOn the one hand, the specific metallic atoms in M-N-C motifs possess distinct selectivity in ORR (2e or 4e pathways). On the other hand, the surround coordination structures via defect engineering can also play crucial roles for impacting the ORR reaction pathways. For instance, the isolated atomic Pt species (denoted as IA-Pt) were reported to possess a high selectivity for the production of H2O2 via a 2e pathway rather than H2O via a 4e pathway, which is totally different from Pt bulk because of a lack of synergy of the Pt-Pt bond.57 To get insight into the synergy of adjacent dual-sites of atomic M1-M2 species in defect-based motifs, Yao and coworkers developed an atomic Co-Pt nitrogen-carbon-based catalyst (denoted as A-CoPt-NC) that directly utilized the induced defects in the shell of carbon capsules to form atomic Co-Pt-N-C coordination structures as active sites through electrochemical activation (Figure 5F).35 Electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) analysis of the Pt revealed that there was little Pt loading on the carbon shell (ECSA was nearly zero) in the first 2,000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles (zone A in Figure 5G) because of the rarity of adsorption sites in the carbon. Thereafter, with the continuous electrochemical activation (2,000–7,000 CV cycles), the ECSA increased (zone B in Figure 5G), suggesting that more atomic Pt species are immobilized in N-doped carbon defects to form Pt-N-C motifs, whereas partial amorphous carbon in graphitic carbon shells is corroded during CV cycles. Simultaneously, creating channels also allows ingress of acidic solvent and the gradual removal Co cores, generating adjacent metallic dual sites of Co(Pt)-Pt(Co)-N-C motifs, as evidenced by direct AC-HRTEM observations (Figure 5H). This A-CoPt-NC catalyst exhibited a half-wave potential of 0.96 V versus RHE in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, demonstrating a much better ORR performance than that of Co-NC and Pt/C (the latter of which was 90 mV lower) (Figure 5I). The control samples containing atomic Co (A-Co-NC) and atomic Pt (A-Co-NC) were prepared individually and showed worse performance than A-CoPt-NC (Figure 5J), indicating the synergistic effect between atomic Co and Pt for ORR. Further DFT calculations revealed that great ORR activity and high selectivity for a 4e ORR pathway was attributed to asymmetry in the electron distribution around the Pt/Co metal centers, as well as the metal-atom coordination with\nChem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019 1381\nspecific defects (e.g., N8V4 defect, in which N8 represents the number of nitrogen atoms and V4 indicates the number of vacant carbon atoms) (Figure 5K)."

      "text" : "The OER represents the rate-determining step of electrocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen. Creating anion or cation vacancies and adjusting their density has proven to be an effective strategy for designing high-performance OER catalysts because of the low formation energy.13,14 For instance, Zheng and co-workers reported a facile method of preparing mesoporous Co3O4 nanowires (NWs) with abundant oxygen vacancies (Figure 6A),58 where the pristine mesoporous Co3O4 NWs were treated with NaBH4 at room temperature to reduce Co3O4 NWs for introducing the oxygen vacancies. Compared with the pristine Co3O4 NWs, the reduced Co3O4 NWs showed a 7-fold enhancement of water oxidation catalytic activity (at a potential of 1.65 V versus RHE) as an efficient OER catalyst (Figure 6B). Moreover, the chronoamperometric measurements showed that the current density of the reduced Co3O4 remained at 69% of its initial current density (1.6 mA cm 2) after 6,000 s, higher than that of the pristine Co3O4, which retained only 35% (Figure 6C), suggesting the stability of oxygen vacancies serving as the active sites for OER. However, the oxygen vacancies created during NaBH4 reduction are difficult to control. To address this challenge, Yao and co-workers demonstrated a controllable hydrogenation treatment by tuning annealing temperatures and hydrogen pressures to further precisely control the density of oxygen vacancies in oxide materials (Figure 6D).29 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Fe1Co1Ox-origin and Fe1Co1Ox200 C-z samples showed characteristic peaks corresponding to the cubic Co3O4 phase, whereas the peaks shifted after being hydrogenated at 300 C or higher temperatures, suggesting the occurrence of a phase transformation (Figure 6E). SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that compared with Fe1Co1Ox-origin, the Fe1Co1Ox-200 C-2.0 MPa sample exhibited a much rougher surface and retained the nanosheet morphology, implying the formation of more defects (Figure 6F).\nFurthermore, the particle agglomeration appeared to accompany the phase transformation at the high temperature of 400 C (Figure 6F). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Figure 6G) revealed that the Fe1Co1Ox-200 C-z samples with increased hydrogenation pressures possessed increasingly higher amounts of oxygen vacancies than Fe1Co1Ox-origin. The OER LSV curves showed that Fe1Co1Ox-200 C2.0 MPa had a much better OER performance than RuO2, Fe1Co1Ox-origin and Fe1Co1Ox-200 C-0.5 MP, indicating that the OER performance can be significantly enhanced by increased oxygen vacancies (Figure 6H). More importantly, such oxygen vacancies can be well retained after a long-term stability test for 10,000 s (Figure 6I). Through DFT calculations, the authors revealed that an optimal oxygen vacancy density is the key to improving the OER activity (Figure 6J). Alternatively, Wang and co-workers developed a plasma-engraving strategy to generate oxygen vacancies on the surface of Co3O4 nanosheets to simultaneously adjust the electronic states and increase the surface area, leading to exposing more active sites (Figure 6K).59 As expected, the Co3O4 nanosheets treated with Ar plasma for 120 s exhibited much higher OER performance than did pristine Co3O4 nanosheets (Figure 6L) and a superior stability after 2,000 cycles (Figure 6M). Since then, such a plasma-engraving strategy has also been employed in exfoliation of bulk 2D materials, such as CoSe2, to introduce defects and exposure more active sites. 26 Besides anion defects, cation defects have also been proved to promote OER properties. Shao and co-workers found that the A-site cation defect of a perovskite type (ABX3) LaFeO3 can greatly enhance both the OER and ORR activities because of\n1382 Chem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019\nChem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019 1383\n(A–D) Schematic preparation of P-Co3O4 and VO-Co3O4 by a plasma-assisted approach (A).

KGaA, Weinheim.\nthe simultaneous creation of surface oxygen vacancies and Fe4+ species with an optimal eg orbital filling (t2g 3eg 1) (Figures 6N–6P).60\nHowever, it is still a grand challenge to retain the stability of these defect sites, especially under the harsh redox process of electrocatalysis. To this end, coordination of the defect sites with non-metal (or metal) atomic species in defect-rich carbons, gC3N4, TMDs, and other metal compounds could be a potential strategy for stabilizing the topological structures of defects, preventing atomic metal species from aggregation, and even further manipulating the local electronic distribution through the diverse coordinated configurations.30,61–64 Recently, Wang and co-workers successfully filled the in-situ-generated oxygen vacancies of Co3O4 with P by a facile plasma strategy as an electrocatalyst for the overall water splitting (Figure 7A).65 In Co K-edge XANES spectra, with P filled in the O vacancy site, the arising edge of pre-peak of P-Co3O4 has the lowest energy intensity (Figure 7B), indicating that the electron can be transferred more easily to the Co 3d orbital of P-Co3O4 than pristine Co3O4 and VO-Co3O4. The P-Co3O4 exhibited higher OER performance than pristine Co3O4 and VO-Co3O4 and only required an overpotential of 280 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm 2 (Figure 7C), which is attributed to the significant shrink in band gap from pristine Co3O4 to P-Co3O4 (Figure 7D). Yao and co-\n1384 Chem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019\nworkers successfully used the Ar plasma to create Se vacancies on the CoSe2 nanosheets with the thickness of 1.8 nm and then load the Pt single atoms onto the nanosheet surface through ultraviolet irradiation (Figures 7E and 7F).28 X-ray absorption spectroscopy and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) tests both verified the existence of Pt single atoms in the form of atomically coordinated Pt-Co-Se moieties (Figures 7G and 7H). The filling of single Pt could remarkably enhance the OER activity of CoSe2 (CoSe2-x-Pt), which wasmuch better than that of single Ni and even Ru atomic species filled CoSe2-x (CoSe2-x-Ni and CoSe2-x-Ru) (Figure 7I). Mechanism studies have unraveled that the single Pt can induce much higher electronic distribution asymmetry degree than either single Ni or Ru and synergistically benefit the interaction between the Co sites and adsorbates (OH*, O*, and OOH*) duringOER process, leading to a superior OER activity (Figure 7J)."

      "text" : "Electrochemical water splitting to produce H2 is recognized as a sustainable solution for renewable energy storage and transportation, in which bulk Pt is known as the best HER catalyst. In pursuit of a higher cost efficiency, different strategies such as improving Pt atom efficiency and developing non-Pt catalysts have been widely explored to date.11,66,67\nBy electrodepositing Pt onto a bismuth ultramicroelectrode, Bard and co-workers illustrated a positive dependence of intrinsic Pt-catalyzed HER activity with its aggregated atom number.68 Therefore, how to manipulate different Pt coordination structure toward a maximum Pt usage while maintaining the high activity is a prerequisite. Wu and co-workers reported an iced-photochemical reduction method of preparing atomically dispersed Pt coordinating with different carbon defects (single vacancy, double vacancy, and edge sites) over mesoporous carbon (MC) substrate.69 As shown in Figure 8A, this Pt1/MC catalyst delivered a current density of 100 mA cm 2 at an overpotential of 65 mV, superior to that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C. Calculated Gibbs free energies for atomic H adsorption, DGH*, on different MC defects and edges were found to be smaller than those on Pt(111), confirming the enhancement of HER activities in Pt-Cdefects motif. Similar to Pt-C, 70 Pt-N-C71 and Pt1-O2-Fe1-N4-C 72 coordination have also been reported to boost HER performance on atomic Pt sites.\nIn addition to this carbon-defect-based structure engineering, other HER active motifs (such as isolated Pt atoms anchored on CoP-based nanotube arrays73 or fewlayer MoS2 nanosheets, 27 Pt-O coordination dispersed over TiO2, 74 and atomically dispersed Cu-Pt dual sites on Pd nanorings75) have been successfully demonstrated. Bao and co-workers came up with a strategy for triggering the HER activity of an inert MoS2 surface by replacing Mo atoms in MoS2 with various single-atom metals (Figure 8B).27 In this system, the dopedmetal atoms can tune the adsorption behavior of H atoms on the neighboring S sites, resulting in a significantly enhanced HER activity on theMoS2 surface. More importantly, the reactants and harsh environments do not directly contact the metal dopants because of protection from the trilayered sandwich structure of MoS2, which thereby increases the catalytic stability and anti-poison ability. Atomic Pd-doped MoS2 to introduce sulfur vacancy and to trigger H adsorption has been explored as well.76 Figure 8C shows the highly oxidized state and localized Pt-O coordination structure of a Pt/TiO2 catalyst; 74 the 5d orbital of the oxidized Pt atoms appears to hybridize with the H 1s orbital to form weak Pt-H valence bonds, leading to a DGH* approximately 0 eV and experimentally an excellent electrocatalytic HER activity.\nChem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019 1385\n(A) HAADF-STEM image of Pt/MC catalyst prepared via iced-photochemical reduction, as well as its HER performance and energetics analysis.

Nanoscale MoS2 as a representative nonprecious TMD material has attracted ever-growing interest as a HER catalyst. It is known that the active sites of pristine MoS2 are located at the edges, 77–79 leaving a large area of basal planes useless. To better address this concern, Wang and co-workers theoretically evaluated the capabilities of 16 kinds of point defects and grain boundaries to activate the basal plane of MoS2 monolayer (Figure 9A). 80 Six types of defects have been identified to greatly improve the HER performance of the in-plane domains of MoS2, among which Vs on MoS2 point defects and S bridge and 4j8a grain boundaries exhibit outstanding activity in both Heyrovsky and Tafel reactions. Experimentally, Xie and colleagues put forward defect engineering on the basal (002) planes to increase the exposure of active edge sites by forming cracks on the surfaces of the nanosheets (Figure 9B).81 Ajayan and co-workers demonstrated that either oxygen plasma exposure or hydrogen treatment on pristine monolayer MoS2 could introduce more active sites via the formation of defects within the monolayer, leading to a high density of exposed edges and a significant improvement of the hydrogen evolution activity.82 These as-fabricated defects are characterized at the scale from macroscopic continuum to discrete atoms, as shown in Figure 9C. Besides MoS2, carbon matrices are also widely explored because of their abundance of defect\n1386 Chem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019\nconfigurations for potential metal-support coordination engineering.83 Typically, Mo-N-C,84 Co-N-C moieties dispersed over graphene (or graphitized carbon),85,86 and atomic Ni- or Fe-trapped in graphdiyne87 are recognized as highly active sites for HER. Several representative atomic structure characterizations are adapted in Figures 9D–9H. Taking Co-N-C for example, Figure 9I shows the HER activity comparison between N-C, Co-C, and Co-N-C moieties. The CoNx/C catalyst showed an overpotential of only 133 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, which is only\n100 mV lower than that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, rotating ring-disk electrode measurement provides a more accurate evaluation of the onset potential of HER, i.e., ca. 20 mV overpotential on Co-N-C, 60 mV on Co-C, and 220 mV on N-C motifs. Detailed Tafel slope analysis sheds light on the different rate-limiting step (RLS) between these three coordination structures: N-C and CoC show a Tafel slope of 98 and 106 mV per decade, respectively, suggesting a RLS of initial proton adsorption on these two catalysts. Co-N-C reveals a Tafel slope of 57 mV per decade, which could suggest hydrogen production via the VolmerHeyrovsky mechanism, and that the electrochemical desorption step is rate limiting. Another representative HER case is Mo1-N1-C2 versus Mo-N and Mo-C catalytic motifs,84 in which an onset overpotential of 13 mV has been achieved on Mo1-N1-C2, much lower than that of the Mo-C (107 mV) and Mo-N (121 mV) counterparts. Theoretical calculations confirm that DGH* is lower on Mo-N-C than on Mo-C, Mo-N, and N-C, highlighting the vital role of coordination-structure engineering to finely tune HER performance. Besides metal-N-C-based coordination structures, bare carbon defects with diverse topological motifs can also finely tune the electronic structure of anchored atomic metal species.30,88,89 For instance, Yao and co-workers employed an impregnation method with acid leaching to prepare defective-graphene-trapped atomic Ni catalysts (denoted as A-Ni@DG) with Ni loading up to 1.24%, which exhibited superb HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte (hHER = 70 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm 2) superior to that of Ni@DG and DG (Figure 10A).30 Remarkably, the A-Ni@DG catalyst has exhibited much higher turnover frequency (TOF) values (more than ten times) than those of non-preciousmetal-based catalysts at various overpotentials, suggesting the high utilizing efficiency of Ni in the A-Ni@DG catalyst (Figure 10B). DFT calculations revealed that the optimal hydrogen desorption energy of A-Ni@DG can be achieved by atomic Ni-D5775 defect coordinated motifs, approaching that of Pt (Figure 10C).\nBeyond point-defect motifs, Yao and co-workers further demonstrated a 2D heterostructured NiFe LDH-NS@DG hybrid by coupling exfoliated Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet (NS) and DG as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.90 Remarkably, this catalyst has exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance in overall alkaline water splitting (20 mA cm 2 at 1.5 V), ranking better than other non-noble-metal bifunctional catalysts (Figures 10D and 10E). For practical applications, this catalyst can be activated by only a 1.5 V solar panel (Figure 10F), which has high potential for the distributed energy storage and conversion systems. The simulation of electronic structures in NiFe LDH-NS@DG catalyst has revealed that the formed heterostructure can efficiently enhance the charge separation and redistribution (electron-rich zones on diverse carbon defect sites and electron-deficient zones on NiFe LDH-NS) (Figure 10G), thus facilitating the HER and OER conducted on DG and NiFe LDH-NS, respectively (Figure 10H). More importantly, to meet the industrial application by mass production of efficient electrocatalysts, Yao and co-workers applied the developed defect tailoring strategies into cheap and earth-abundant resources, such as activated carbons and seaweed- or macadamia-nut-shell-derived carbon-based materials, which have been summarized in the recent review on defect electrocatalysis.13\nChem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019 1387\n(A) Catalytic reaction pathways and energies of the HER on MoS2 basal with structural defects of grain boundaries and point defects.

      "text" : "Electrocatalytic CO2RR has attracted considerable interest in the past years by serving as a promising solution for closing anthropogenic carbon cycle and delocalized energy storage by converting CO2 into renewable fuels and chemical feedstocks.91–93 In addition to the well-known Cu-, Au-, and Ag-based catalysts, single-metal or metalloid-heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts consisting of earthabundant and low-cost elements are an emerging material for selective CO2RR. 94,95\nFrom a theoretical view, Siahrostami and co-workers reported an energetically favorable N doping near the carbon defects arisen from the defect-induced strain to stabilize N dopant and examined the CO2RR activity of a wide range of different possible active sites in both pristine and defective carbon structures with or without N doping (Figure 11A).19 Of special interest, the examined defective carbon active sites do not fall on the known scaling line between *COOH and *CO adsorption energies for the transition metals because they do not bind CO. This is the reason that carbon-based materials represent especially interesting alternatives for the 2e reduction of CO2 to CO. On the basis of a simple thermodynamic limiting potential analysis, pyridinic N is suggested to be the most selective site for the CO2RR over HER. Experimentally, Ajayan and co-workers reported a similar active assignment of the pyridinic N, which retains a lone pair of electrons that are capable of binding CO2 and lowering its activation barrier to *COOH, in nitrogen-doped CNTs (NCNTs; Figure 11B) for the CO2-to-CO conversion. 96,97 Other carbon motifs with pyridinic defects, such as 3D graphene foam,98 nanoporous carbon,99 quaternary and graphitic nitrogen-doped CNTs,100,101 and steam-etched carbon frameworks,102 have also been explored to date. In addition to these sp2 hybridization carbon matrices of graphene and CNTs, another kind of sp3 hybridization nanodiamond carbon with metalloid doping has also been investigated toward CO2 reduction products beyond CO. For example, a boron-doped diamond with a p-type doped surface can produce formaldehyde at a maximum faradic efficiency (FE) of 74%,103 and a Ndoped nanodiamond supported on a Si rod array could generate acetate and formate with 91.8% FE at 1.0 V with a proposed reaction pathway of CO2 / CO2 $– / (COO)2 $ / CH3COO – (Figure 11C).104\nBulk Cu electrode is known to generate multiple C2+ products from CO2RR; nevertheless, once atomic Cu sites are dispersed over Ni(OH)2 105 or CeO2 106 substrates, these isolated Cu centers can no longer catalyze the C-C coupling during CO2RR but instead effectively convert CO2 into CO and CH4. Moreover, by delicate control of the catalytic metal-C (or -N) motif at the atomic scale, other earth-abundant transition metals such as Ni, Co, and Fe can be employed to deliver a comparable CO2to-CO performance with a benchmark Au electrode.\nSimilar to molecular metal-porphyrin107 and metal-cyclam108 catalysts, M-N4 moieties dispersed over different carbon supports with four neighboring nitrogen atoms have been widely reported as active sites for reducing CO2 to CO. 109–114 Wu and coworkers prepared Co-Nx-C catalysts with fine-tuned Co-N coordination numbers by controlling the volatile C-N fragments at different pyrolysis temperatures.115 Co-N2 sites exhibited the best CO2RR performance with a CO TOF of 18,200 h\n1 at an overpotential of 0.52 V.

Three-dimensional atomic probe tomography of over 10,000 individual Ni single atoms clearly reveals a direct and predominant Ni-C coordination. As a result, these Ni-C active sites deliver a maximum CO FE of 93.2% with a TOF of 28,800 h 1 at an overpotential of 0.7 V. Furthermore, by replacing one or two neighboring carbon atoms with nitrogen, Wang and co-workers comparatively investigated the CO2RR and HER pathways over M@SV/DV with or without neighboring N.119 Whereas Co-N@SV/DV catalyzed HER exclusively, the Ni-N@DV moieties maintained a CO FE above 90% for more than 20 h of CO2RR electrolysis. In our latest work, by creating abundant O and N defects over carbon spheres (Figure 12B), we developed a facile and scalable synthesis of Ni-single-atom catalysts on commercial carbon black, which we further employed in a gas-phase electrocatalytic reactor under ambient conditions.120 As a result, those single atomic sites in carbon vacancies yielded a CO2-to-CO reduction current density above 100 mA cm-2 with nearly 100% selectivity for CO and around\nChem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019 1391\n(A) Thermodynamic analysis of CO2RR over different atomic sites of Ni-doped carbon vacancies with or without neighboring N, together with direct coordination nature determined by 3D atomic probe tomography.

Moreover, the overall current in one unit cell could easily ramp up to more than 8 A while maintaining an exclusive CO evolution with a generation rate of 3.34 L h 1 per unit cell. This demonstration could pave the way toward practical CO2 reduction in the future.\n1392 Chem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019\nAlso noteworthy is the development of advanced operando spectroscopy, which sheds light on the local coordination structure assignment and therefore provides a better understanding of reaction mechanisms. By employing operando X-ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, Liu and co-workers identified the monovalent Ni(i) atomic center with a d9 electronic configuration in Ni-NG as the catalytically active site for CO2RR (Figure 12C). 121 A charge transfer was first observed from the unpaired electron in the 3dx2-y2 orbital of Ni(i) to the carbon 2p orbital in CO2 to form a CO2 d species at open circuit potential. Thereafter, the Ni K-edge of Ni-NG shifted back to lower energy in CO2RR working potential, suggesting the recovery of low-oxidation-state Ni after one cycle of CO2 reduction (Ni(i)* + CO2 + 2H + + 2e / Ni(i)* + CO + H2O). In another recent report, Li and co-workers anchored cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) on a polymer-derived hollow N-doped porous carbon sphere support,122 which showed a 15.5-fold enhancement of CO2-to-CO activity over the CoPc precursor (Figure 12D). By comparing the wavelet transform contour plots between supported and unsupported CoPc, as well as the fitting of Co K-edge extended absorption spectra, the authors demonstrated the coordinative interaction between single Co atom in CoPc and N atom in N-doped carbon substrate, leading to the active site of Co-N5 for CO2RR."

The role of defects can not only serve as the anchoring site to stabilize single non-metal (or metal) heteroatoms but also help to tune the electronic and/or geometric structures of the defect-based coordination motifs, thus facilitating specific electrochemical reactions (ORR, OER, HER, and CO2RR in this review). In addition, through manipulation of material microstructures, spatial defects induced from in situ and ex situ synthetic strategies can further promote the mass transport of intermediate reactants on the solid-liquid-gas triple-phase boundary regions to enhance the kinetics of electrocatalysis. However, despite the numerous research progress that has been made in investigating the defects of electrocatalysts, several significant challenges still exist, and these deserve continuing attention for exploration of the effect of defects on electrocatalysts:\n(1) Control of defect types: because different electrochemical reactions possess\ndistinct energy barriers, it is desirable to fabricate ideal electrocatalysts with a single type of defect as the active site to maximize the catalytic process without side effects. Thus, new control methods on defect engineering need to be urgently explored to better elucidate the fundamental correlation between the defects and the activity. (2) Stability of defects: although various catalysts with defects show desirable\nstability in diverse electrochemical reactions, it should be determined whether the defects are changed or reconstructed under harsh working conditions. Therefore, tracking the possible evolution of defect-based motifs is very essential for researchers to establish the correct proof of concept for catalyst design. (3) Advanced operando characterizations: to address the above two challenges,\nmore accurate and advanced in situ measurements should be coupled with theoretical insights, which could help us dynamically observe the role of defects during the real-time process of electrocatalysis.\nChem 5, 1371–1397, June 13, 2019 1393\n(4) Last but not the least, further scaling up the energy conversion performance\nof defective materials calls for continuous efforts in both robust catalyst design and interface optimization with well-defined mass and charge transport.\nAll in all, we believe that the fundamental understanding of the role of defects in catalysts will promote the development of the whole field in electrocatalysis and push them into industrial applications."

    "abstractText" : "The Bigger Picture Electrocatalytic energy conversion technologies have been widely considered a clean and sustainable way to alleviate the reliance on fossil fuels. The development of efficient and affordable electrocatalysts plays a key aspect in energy conversion processes by lowering the reaction kinetic barriers and thus boosting the efficiency and selectivity of diverse electrochemical reactions (e.g., oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen and carbon dioxide reduction reactions). Recently, defect engineering has emerged as a new strategy for tailoring the electronic structures and interface coordination; however, the role of ‘‘defect’’related sites in as-designed electrocatalysts has not yet been fully understood. In this review, we will shed light on the recent advances in tailoring nanomaterials from the aspects of constructing defect-based motifs as active sites for versatile electrochemical energy conversions as well as their underlying mechanism on structure-property correlations. The development of advanced catalysts for efficient electrochemical energy conversion technologies to alleviate the reliance on fossil fuels has attracted considerable interest in the last decades. Insight into the roles of reactive sites in nanomaterials is significant for understanding and implementing the design principles of nanocatalysts. Recently, the essential role of defects, including vacancies, reconstructed defects, and doped non-metal (or metal)-defect-based motifs, have been widely demonstrated to promote the diverse electrochemical processes (e.g., O2 [or CO2] reduction reactions and H2 [or O2] evolution reactions). Nevertheless, the in-depth exploration of the underlying defect electrocatalytic mechanism is still in its infancy. This review summarizes the state-ofthe-art defect engineering strategies for designing highly efficient electrochemical nanocatalysts with special emphasis on the correlation between defect structures and electrocatalytic properties. Finally, some perspectives on the challenges and future research directions in this promising area are presented.",
