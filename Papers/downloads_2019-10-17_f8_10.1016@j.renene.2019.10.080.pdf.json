In present study, the alumina as additive with concentrations of 30, 60, and 90 ppm were added to B5 and B10 blends for evaluation of the engine performance, emissions, and vibration levels. An ANN model based on standard back-propagation learning algorithm for the engine was developed. Multi-layer perception network (MLP) was used for a non-linear mapping between the input and target parameters. The input or independent parameters were fuel blend, engine speed, fuel density, fuel viscosity, LHV, intake manifold pressure, fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature, oxygen contained in exhaust gases, oil temperature, relative humidity, and ambient air pressure. Whereas, the target parameters separately were engine power, torque, emissions of CO, CO2, UHC, NO, RMS and Kurtosis of engine’s vibration. The results for optimum ANN model showed, the training algorithm of back-propagation with 25-25 neurons in hidden layers (logsig-logsig) is able to predict different parameters of engine for different conditions. The corresponding R-values for training, validation and testing were 0.9999, 0.9994 and 0.9995, respectively. The performance and accuracy of the proposed ANN model was completely satisfactory.

Introduction 4 Reducing the use of fossil fuels significantly can decrease the harmful emissions. This can 5 be achieved by replacing of fossil fuels by renewable fuels. Sustainable sources of renewable 6 energy will play an important role in the future of global energy [1]. Meanwhile, biodiesel is 7 a renewable-sustainable bioenergy which can be produced from vegetable oils, animal fats 8 and micro-algal oil, and also it can be applied instead of diesel fuel without any special 9 modifications of the engines [2,3].\n4 1 Performance, emissions, combustion, and vibration of SI and CI engines have been 2 studied in different investigations [2,4]. Recent researches have shown that using bioethanol 3 and biodiesel reduce the amount of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon 4 monoxide, sulfur oxides, and solid particles emitted from the engine exhaust [5–7]. Only the 5 nitrogen oxides (NOx) contents increase that can be reduced via adjusting the fuel injection 6 timing [6]. 7 On the other hand, adding nanoparticles or nano-catalyst to diesel-biodiesel blends 8 improves the engine performance, emissions, and thermo-physical properties of fuels due to 9 high surface-to-volume ratio, thermal conductivity, and mass diffusivity [8]. Based on the 10 literature reviews, it has been found that nano-additives as well as diesel, biodiesel, and their 11 blends enhance the flash point, kinematic viscosity, and other characteristics [9]. 12 In terms of mechanical effects, vibration caused by the combustion process could have 13 direct effects on durability and wear of engine parts. Injection timing, injector’s spraying, fuel 14 quantity, and fuel type [2,10] effect on SI and CI engine’s block vibration [2,11]. For 15 example, the addition of biodiesel to petro-diesel fuel changes the engine’s block vibration 16 due to the combustion and fluctuations pressure inside the cylinder [2,12]. 17 Recently, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) [13] and time series [14–16] have been 18 used for system diagnosis. Artificial neural networks are used to solve a wide variety of 19 problems in science and engineering, particularly for some areas where the conventional 20 modeling methods have failed. A well-trained ANN can be used as a predictive model for a 21 specific application, which is a data-processing system inspired by biological neural system. 22 The predictive ability of an ANN is due to the training on experimental data, and then 23 validation by independent data. An ANN has the ability to re-learn to improve its 24 performance if there is new data set [17,18]. An ANN model can accommodate multiple 25 input variables to predict multiple output variables. It differs from conventional modeling\n5 1 approaches because of its ability to learn about the system, so that it can be modeled without 2 prior knowledge of the process relationships [18]. Consequently, several examples of the 3 research works in the case of engines’ characteristics fueled with different fuels are 4 presented. 5 Canakci et al. investigated the applicability of ANN for the performance and exhaust 6 emission values of a diesel engine fueled with biodiesels extracted from different feedstock 7 and petro-diesel fuels. To train the network, the average molecular weight, net heat of 8 combustion, specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, C/H ratio and cetane number of each fuel 9 were used as the input layer, while outputs were the SFC, EGT, and emissions. The network 10 yield (R2-value) was 0.99, and the mean errors was smaller than 4.2% for the training data, 11 while the R2-value was about 0.99, and the mean errors were smaller than 5.5% for the test 12 data [19]. Dehghani et al. used ANN to predict performance and exhaust emissions of a SI 13 two-stroke engine with bio-lubricants. The inputs of the model were lubricant type, lambda 14 and engine speed. Model outputs were engine brake power, torque, SFC, and exhaust 15 emissions. A multilayer perceptron neural network model with a 3–25–8 (number of input 16 layer–hidden layer–output layer nodes) configuration was developed for performance and 17 emissions. The study showed the used ANN approach can accurately predict the problems of 18 internal combustion engines [20]. Ghobadian et al. studied the ANN to predict a two 19 cylinders, four-stroke diesel engine performance and exhaust emission analysis using waste 20 cooking biodiesel [18]. Kapusuz et al. used ANN to predict torque, brake power and brake 21 specific in a spark-ignition engine. R-values for torque, brake power, and SFC was obtained 22 0.9906, 0.997 and 0.9312, respectively [21]. Ismail et al. studied the ANN modelling for a 23 light-duty diesel engine powered using blends of various biodiesel fuels with conventional 24 fossil diesel. Five parameters of engine speed, fuel blends, torque, fuel mass, and flow rate 25 were as the input parameters. ANN was used to predict the emissions of CO, CO2, NO, UHC,\n6 1 maximum pressure, location of maximum pressure, maximum heat release rate, location of 2 maximum heat release rate and cumulative heat release rate. They reported that back3 propagation feed-forward neural network, combination of tan-sig/purelin transfer functions, 4 trainlm training algorithm, and an NoN value of 10 are the optimum configuration to predict 5 the engine-output responses for the experimental setup [22]. 6 In another study, Javed et al. investigated the use of ANN modeling for prediction of 7 performance and emission characteristics of a four-stroke single cylinder diesel engine with 8 Jatropha Methyl Ester biodiesel blends along with hydrogen in dual fuel mode. The results 9 indicated trainlm back-propagation algorithm with log-sig and tan-sig transfer function leads 10 to the best model for prediction of performance and emissions characteristics [23]. Deh Kiani 11 et al. used the ANN to predict the engine brake power, output torque and exhaust emissions 12 of the spark ignition engine using ethanol-gasoline blends. Results showed the ANN model 13 based on standard back-propagation algorithm provided the best accuracy in modeling of 14 emission with correlation coefficient equal to 0.98, 0.96, 0.90 and 0.71 for CO, CO2, HC and 15 NOx, and 0.99 and 0.96 for torque and brake power, respectively [17]. Rezaei et al. used the 16 ANN to predict the performance of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) 17 engines with the butanol and ethanol fuels. ANNs modelling with two types of including 18 radial basis function (RBF) and feed-forward (FF) were developed to predict the seven 19 engine performance metrics. The validation results indicated both RBF and FF models can 20 predict HCCI engine performance metrics with less than 4% error for butanol and ethanol 21 fueled engines. They reported that the FF neural network models need fewer neurons and 22 twice as much training time compared to the RBF models [24]. In a research study, Uzun 23 applied the ANN to predict the effect of crankshaft angel, engine speed and loads on diesel 24 engine performance in terms of BSFC, both with and without intercooling [25]. Yusaf et al. 25 investigated the ANN modelling to predict brake power, torque, SFC, and emissions of a\n7 1 diesel engine modified to operate with a combination of both compressed natural gas CNG 2 and diesel fuels. The correlation coefficient were 0.9884, 0.9838, 0.95707, and 0.9934 for the 3 engine torque, SFC, NOx and exhaust temperature, respectively [26]. In another study, 4 Sharma et al. used the ANN to predict the performance and exhaust parameters of a diesel 5 engine at different injection pressures using biodiesel and diesel blended [27]. Çay et al. 6 developed an ANN modeling to predict the SFC, effective power, average effective pressure, 7 and EGT of the methanol fueled engine. For optimum model, R-values were near to one for 8 both training and testing data [28]. Oğuz et al. investigated the prediction of diesel engine 9 performance using biofuels by ANN. Results showed the proposed ANN is an appropriate 10 model to estimate the performance of the engine [29]. Javed et al. investigated the vibration 11 analysis of a diesel engine using diesel-biodiesel fuel blend mixed with 100 ppm ZnO 12 nanoparticles (20 & 40 nm sizes) along with dual fueling of hydrogen. They used ANN 13 model to predict root mean square (RMS) of vibration velocity. They found the regression 14 values of 0.97185, 0.98574 and 0.96913 for prediction of RMS velocities in lateral, vertical 15 & axial directions respectively. The results showed the best fuel blend with least vibration is 16 B30 and B20 with nano particle of size 40 nm for hydrogen flow rates of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 17 l/min [30]. 18 Considering to above literature reviews, it can be concluded that the research on 19 performance, combustion, and vibration characteristics of diesel engines using added alumina 20 to biodiesel-diesel blends by ANN has not been reported so far. Therefore, the objective of 21 this study is to develop a neural network model for predicting engine parameters like power, 22 torque, combustion, and vibration in relation to input variables such as fuel blend, engine 23 speed, fuel density, fuel viscosity, LHV, oil temperature, exhaust O2 content, and other 24 factors that are described in the next sections. We can say that in most prior research works, 25 often two parameters of engine speed and fuel type are involved in neural network analysis;\n8 1 and many factors affected the engine performance including density and viscosity of fuel, 2 oxygen content output, etc., has been ignored. In the other words, in the previous researches, 3 the input of the neural network is limited to a few parameters, while in present research as an 4 innovation; all possible parameters affecting the engine performance are involved in the 5 modelling. Thus, in this research the mentioned input factors will be evaluated by the ANN. 6 The presented ANN model is a great importance due to its ability to predict engine 7 characteristics under varying conditions. 8 9 2.

NO 108.06-187.12 ppm The minimum and maximum of NO emission are related to B0, and B5AL30-B10AL90 fuel blends, respectively. There is a positive correlation between the NO content and exhaust temperature trend. This indicates that rising of exhaust temperature has an important role in NO generation. RMS of acceleration in three direction 23.24-57.60 m/s2 With increasing engine speed, the RMS of the acceleration greatly increased in three direction. In addition, with adding of nanoparticles to the diesel-biodiesel blend, the amount of vibration increases. Kurtosis of acceleration in three direction 0.14-11.32 As the engine speed increases, the kurtosis of acceleration decreased, and engine works smoother. The smoother engine performance is for B10 fuel blend.\n5 6 After evaluating the effects of the input parameters, developed ANN model was used to 7 predict the performance, emission, and vibration of CI engine with mentioned fuel blends. To 8 get the best prediction by the network, different structure of network was tried. Summary of 9 different networks evaluated to yield the criteria of network performance are represented in 10 Table 8. In this table, the trainlm algorithm by combining the transfer function of tan-sig, log11 sig used for hidden layers of 1 and 2. The purelin transfer function selected for output layer. 12 The optimal network has two hidden layer with 25 neurons for each hidden layer. The 13 performance of the network is shown in Fig. 3. The correlation coefficient (R-value) of this\n19\n1 optimal topology for training, validation, and testing are 0.9999, 0.9994, and 0.9995, 2 respectively. The MSE values of the optimal topology model for training, validation, and 3 testing obtained as 0, 23.54, and 59.53, respectively.\n4\n5 Fig. 3. The performance of the optimum ANN model. 6 7 A regression analysis was performed between the network output and the corresponding 8 targets in order to investigate the network response in more detail. The results showed the 9 constructed model sufficiently predict the performance, emissions, and vibration of CI diesel 10 engine at various engine speeds. The ANN predicted outputs versus measured values for 11 performance, emissions, and vibration are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Performance and emissions 12 regression coefficients using ANN are 0.97, 0.96, 0.98, 0.99, 0.98 and 0.98 for torque, power, 13 CO, CO2, NO, and HC, respectively. The ANN predicted outputs versus measured values for 14 vibration are showed in Fig. 5. Vibration regression coefficients using ANN are 0.99, 0.99, 15 0.98, 0.94, 0.98, and 0.95 for RMSx, RMSy, RMSz, Kurtosisx, Kurtosisy, and Kurtosisz, 16 respectively. So, this indicates high correlation between of predicted model and experimental 17 data. 18 19\n20\n1 2Table 8. Summary of different networks evaluated to yield the criteria of network performance.

Prediction of ANN and experimental values of engine’s vibration parameters. 5 6 Diesel engine performance, emission characteristics, and its body vibration are sensitive to 7 engine control parameters such as engine speed, fuel types, properties of fuel, relative 8 humidity, intake temperature and pressure, etc. Hence, ANN is a useful method in reducing\n23\n1 the time and cost needed for full scale test-bed studies when large variations in engine control 2 strategies are involved [22]. The proposed ANN model requires only limited amounts of 3 acquired data for training compared to the common look-up table approach in the ECU of 4 internal combustion engine, in which a large amount of experimental data is needed to predict 5 or calibrate the engine performance, controls emissions, and reduce the engine knocking 6 using vibration signal [24]. In this study, the proposed ANN model can be used to reduce 7 ECU calculation time and calibration cost.\n8 9 6. Conclusion\n10 The main focus of this research study is the prediction of performance (power and torque), 11 emission (CO, CO2, UHC and NO), and vibration (RMSx, RMSy, RMSz, Kurtosisx, Kurtosisy 12 and Kurtosisz) of a CI engine using alumina nanoparticles added to diesel-biodiesel blends by 13 ANN. The results showed that a back-propagation multi-layer perceptron neural network 14 model with training algorithm of levenberg-marquardt and layer arrangement of 12-25-25-12 15 (number of input layer- hidden layer- hidden layer- output layer nodes) was sufficient enough 16 in predicting the diesel engine performance, emissions and engine’s body vibration. In 17 presented model, the experimental data set was included 324 values, of which 227 values 18 were used for training the network, 32 values were selected randomly to test the performance 19 of the trained network and 65 values were selected randomly to valid the network. By 20 analysis of the experimental data by the ANN approach, it was revealed that there is a good 21 correlation between the predicted data resulted from the ANN and measured data. 22 Performance and emission regression R-values using ANN were 0.97, 0.96, 0.98, 0.99, 0.98, 23 and 0.98 for torque, power, CO, CO2, NO and HC, respectively. Also for vibration, RMSx, 24 RMSy, RMSz, Kurtosisx, Kurtosisy, and Kurtosisz, regression R-values were 0.99, 0.99, 0.98, 25 0.94, 0.98, and 0.95, respectively. As a result, the present study indicated the ANN is a\n24\n1 powerful application to predict performance, emission, and vibration in CI and SI engines 2 with reasonable accuracy.\n3 4 Acknowledgments\n5 The authors appreciate Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural 6 Resources, and Iran Nanotechnology Initiative Council for their supports.\n7\n8 References 9\n10 [1] G.

    "abstractText" : "In recent years, added nano-catalysts to fuels has improved their thermo-physical properties. In present study, the alumina as additive with concentrations of 30, 60, and 90 ppm were added to B5 and B10 blends for evaluation of the engine performance, emissions, and vibration levels. An ANN model based on standard back-propagation learning algorithm for the engine was developed. Multi-layer perception network (MLP) was used for a non-linear mapping between the input and target parameters. The input or independent parameters were fuel blend, engine speed, fuel density, fuel viscosity, LHV, intake manifold pressure, fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature, oxygen contained in exhaust gases, oil temperature, relative humidity, and ambient air pressure. Whereas, the target parameters separately were engine power, torque, emissions of CO, CO2, UHC, NO, RMS and Kurtosis of engine’s vibration. The results for optimum ANN model showed, the training algorithm of back-propagation with 25-25 neurons in hidden layers (logsig-logsig) is able to predict different parameters of engine for different conditions. The corresponding R-values for training, validation and testing were 0.9999, 0.9994 and 0.9995, respectively. The performance and accuracy of the proposed ANN model was completely satisfactory.",
