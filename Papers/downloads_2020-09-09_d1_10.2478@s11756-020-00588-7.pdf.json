Their unique properties like composition, extreme stability, fluid dynamics, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, make them desired candidate in modern bioengineering and biotechnology (Arad and Levy-Ontman 2010; Mahapatra and Banerjee 2013; Wang et al. 2018). Naturally occurring polysaccharides from bacterial, fungal and/or algal origin are of great biomedical importance apart from their industrial applications. They have widely studied for their effective retroviral inhibition and anti-tumor activity (Wang et al. 2014a, b; Li et al. 2015; Deepak et al. 2016; Ramamoorthy et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2019; Lu et al. 2019). Most of them have also been studied for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, anti-parasitic activities as well as for their immunomodulatory and smooth muscle proliferation (Meng et al. 2016; Ravichandran et al. 2018; Zhou et al. 2019; Chou et al. 2019).\nThese polysaccharides form important constituents in particular organisms, either as structural or storage molecules. Among various polysaccharide types based on their origin, bacterial polysaccharides are thus far been overexplored (Asgher et al. 2020a). Most of them present polyanionic characteristics and can attach to positively charged molecules through ionotropic gelation or polyelectrolyte complexation. Therefore , they are extens ive ly be ing used for nanobiotechnological purposes, including the production of nanoparticles and microspheres for controlled drug delivery systems (Bhatia 2016; Gopi et al. 2018). Microbial polysaccharides are divided into the following categories based on their localization in the cell: (1) intracellular polysaccharides, (2) structural polysaccharides, and (3) extracellular polysaccharides."

Several studies have reported excellent antioxidant and anti-cancer activity of intracellular polysaccharides (IPS) as well as their immunomodulatory effect making them useful candidates for biomedical applications (Zhao et al. 2016; Klosterhoff et al. 2018; Song et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2018). Zhang et al. (2016) exploited Pleurotus eryngii (SI-04) for the production of IPS. Two types of IPS, i.e., IPS-1 and IPS-2 were obtained and studied for their hepatoprotective and antioxidant potential. IPS-2 exhibited higher hepatoprotective efficacy by decreasing serum triglycerides and albumin levels, and enhancing serum bilirubin level, ultimately improving hepatic antioxidant status. Similarly, Hao et al. (2016) exploited Fomitopsis pinicola for the production of polysaccharides (EPS and IPS) and studied their functional properties. Results indicated excellent antioxidant properties from both types of\npolysaccharides showing potential applications in biomedical and industrial biotechnological sectors."

Frei and Preston (1964) studied cell walls of few algal species, namely Penicillus, Halimeda, Udotea, Caulerpa, and Dichotomosiphon, using both physical and chemical techniques. They noticed a complete absence of cellulose in their cell-wall and detected the presence of β-l,3xylan as amajor structural polysaccharide. Deniaud-Bouët et al. (2017) reviewed sulfated fucose-containing polysaccharides in brown algal cell walls which perform critical biological roles. These macromolecules exhibit excellent pharmacological and biomedical properties, e.g., antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Moreover, significant immunomodulatory, anti-cancer, and anti-infectious functions of these structural polysaccharides have also been evaluated."

      "heading" : "Extracellular polysaccharides",
      "text" : "Microbial extracellular polysaccharides present diversified nature. There are four major classes of extracellular polysaccharides (microcapsular and slime polysaccharides, polyamides, inorganic polyanhydrides, and polyesters), collectively termed as exopolysaccharides or EPS (Nwodo et al. 2012). The term ‘exopolysaccharides’ was introduced by Sutherland (1972) to explain high molecular weight carbohydrate polymers produced by different microorganisms. The EPS primarily consist of carbohydrates with varying structural composit ion. There are two types of EPS either homopolysaccharides (single type of monomeric subunits linked via glycosidic bond), and heteropolysaccharides (made up of more than one type of monomeric subunits). Table 1 describes some common EPS types, their microbial source, and functional properties.\nExtreme environments are considered a valuable source for industrially relevant microorganisms that produce numerous active biomolecules, including proteins, polysaccharides, and other glycoprotein molecules. Exopolysaccharides (EPS), primarily from extremophilic bacterial species, are of significant concern in modern researches for nanoencapsulation of anticancer drugs and to study their sustained release and anticancer efficacy. Halophilic bacterial species are those found in high salt stress (5–25% of NaCl). Xue et al. (2018) reported polysaccharide production from Halomonas species which exhibited various biological activities. These EPS from extremophilic origin present remarkable characteristics that reflect a bright future in nano-theranostics. Bioactive EPS from Halomonas species were higher molecular weight\npolysaccharides with repeating subunits of glucose, galactose, mannose, and glucuronic acid. It exhibited highly anionic characteristics because of the presence of uronic acid and sulfate moieties. Their pseudo-plasticity, viscoelasticity, and thixotropic behavior make them an ideal candidate for material sciences applications. Likewise, their rheological properties are not affected by the presence of any surfactant, sugars, salts, lactic acid, and change in pH and freeze-thawing (Llamas et al. 2006; Asgher et al. 2020b). Another essential characteristic is the ability to withstand several harsh environmental conditions like high pH, temperature, freeze-thawing, and salt stress. These macromolecules can bind with various metal ions to form stable gels that facilitate the removal of toxic ions from a polluted environment. The presence of high sulfate content in Halomonas EPS contributes to antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects on diseased cells (Dilna et al. 2015; Park et al. 2017a, b)."

      "heading" : "Potential biomedical applications of EPS",
      "text" : "There is a large number of publications dedicated to the potential biomedical applications of microbial EPS and EPSbased nano-structures. This chapter aims to explain such work in an accessible way to highlight a suggestive and relative image of the field.\nEPS-based nano-structures for sustained drug delivery\nThe terms “intelligent drug delivery” or “intelligent therapeutics” are commonly used to represent the sustained delivery of\ntherapeutic drugs to the target area. In this regard, microbial EPS and EPS-based nano-structures have become highly promising materials for their drug loading efficacy (Moscovici 2015; Patra et al. 2013). The hydrogel formation ability of EPS in aqueous media, while itself remaining unsolvable, give them valuable characteristic as drug carrier molecules. Therefore, as micro and nano-carriers, these hydrogels can encapsulate drug molecules into their inner structure or adsorb to their outer surfaces and penetrate to the target site (Fig. 1). The delivery system can show various drug-release properties depending upon biodegradability, bioadhesion, temperature, and pH sensitivity. Hence, the therapeutic efficacy of the drug can be increased by reducing the non-active fraction and increasing its bioavailability to the affected area (Swierczewska et al. 2016).\nNatural polysaccharides exhibit different chemical composition due to the presence of various reactive species, leading to a diversified structural composition. Therefore, these biopolymers are generally considered as safe because of their nontoxic and biodegradable characteristics. Microbial extracellular polymeric substances have extensively been investigated as a drug carrier in pharmaceutics. Pullulan is a neutral biopolymer with nine (-OH) groups, present at repeating subunits, conferring to its specific bioavailability to chemical derivatization. Pullulan composites reinforced with silver nanoparticles exhibit high anti-bacterial efficacy (Kumar et al. 2012). Thermosensitive polyether-amine copolymerized with carboxymethyl pullulan, showed a sol-gel transition at body temperature, which indicate its promising applications in sustained drug delivery. These polymer-composites, comprising carboxymethyl pullulan copolymerized with pH and/or\nTable 1 Overview of some common EPS, their microbial sources and functional properties\nType of EPS\nMicrobial source Functional properties References\nAlginate Azotobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Gelling capacity, anionic exchange, Hydrocolloids, Film forming capacity\nThu et al. 2012; Cervino et al. 2019\nCellulose Gram-positive bacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Acetobacter spp. High tensile strength, insoluble in most solvents, neutral charge, moldability, high crystallinity, Augimeri et al. 2015; Chunshom et al. 2018; Kumar et al. 2019; Chase et al. 2019\nDextran Streptococcus spp. and Leuconostoc spp. Good stability, non-ionic, neutral charge, Newtonian behavior\nBowen and Koo 2011; Takashima et al. 2015; Senpuku et al. 2018\nLevan Alcaligenes viscosus Paenibacillus polymyxa, Bacillus subtilis, Zymomonas mobilis Anti-inflammatory & anti-tumor activities, film forming capacity, low viscosity, high solubility Liu et al. 2012; Esawy et al. 2013; Vijayendra and Shamala 2014 Xanthan Xanthomonas spp. High viscosity, high salt stability, pH and temperature stability hydrocolloids, anionic charge, non-newtonian Julianti et al. 2017; Sriprablom et al. 2019 Gellan Gum Sphingomonas spp. Gelling capacity, wide range of pH stability, hydrocolloids, anionic charge\nMilas et al. 1990; Coutinho et al. 2010; Agnello et al. 2017; Sapper et al. 2019\nHyaluronan Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus spp. High hydrophilicity, biological activity, biocompatible and anionic charge\nMandawe et al. 2018; Schulte and Blank 2018\ntemperature-sensitive hydrogels, usually reserve an antioxidant molecule, e.g., α-tocopherol and lutein, which exhibit improved free-radical scavenging activity (Mocanu et al. 2012).\nPullulan/chitosan nanocomposite has been prepared using electrospinning for sustained drug delivery. The composite properties, i.e., glass transition temperature and melting temperature increased by increasing chitosan content and vice versa. These nanocomposites showed complete dissolution in aqueous media within 60 s (Qin et al. 2019). Another study reported the graft-copolymerization of chitosan-pullulan and dihydrocaffeic acid. The resulting hydrogels showed in vitro pH-dependent swelling, gelation capacity, good injectability, and improved rheological and morphological properties. The resulting hydrogels were loaded with doxorubicin (an anti-cancer drug) at wide pH range. These nanocomposites showed excellent bioavailability and doxorubicin-release properties (Liang et al. 2019). Chitosan-grafted-pullulan hydrogels were also loaded with an anti-bacterial drug (amoxicillin) that proved excellent in vitro anti-bacterial characteristics against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The excellent mucosal-adhesion properties suggest their possible applications in cancer-targeted drug delivery (Liang et al. 2019).\nAmphiphilic EPS-based nano-delivery systems\nGraft copolymerization of hydrophobic components onto the hydrophilic backbone that leads towards the formation of amphiphilic polymeric materials, resulting in self-assembled thermodynamically stable nanogels. Polymeric micelles have been reported to have excellent stability over time, that indicate their promising applications in drug delivery technology by enabling the entrapment of hydrophobic drug into the hydrophilic carrier molecule (Lin et al. 2015; Raveendran et al. 2016; Curcio et al. 2017). Zhang et al. (2013a, b) prepared micelle by copolymerization of PEG with acetylated dextran (an EPS), which can efficiently be used as acid triggered drug transport of anti-cancer drug. Based on pH-responsive variation in hydrodynamic radii (Rh) of block-polymer, it can be expected that these dextran-block polymers can be used as intracellular drug transport.\nAmphiphilic α-tocopherol/pullulan composites have also been synthesized as novel carriers for anti-cancer drugs. These biopolymers can easily self-assembled forming nanomicelles. Wang et al. (2014a) described the highest encapsulation efficacy of these tocopheryl-nanospheres up to 98.3% with sustained in vitro release for over 80 h. These findings showed the state-of-the-art approach towards next-generation intracellular delivery of therapeutic drugs with minimum side\neffects. Studies involving dextran copolymerization have also been conducted for the nano delivery of therapeutic medications. The unique polymeric nature of dextran makes it and exceptional candidate for nano-drug delivery, nano-biosensor, nanomedicine, and intracellular imaging systems. The extremely hydrophilic nature of dextran shows no post-drug delivery toxicity. The complete metabolism of dextran inside the body minimizes the chances of renal failure. By looking at these features, development of EPS-based phospholipid micelles for sustained drug release properties have also been described (Fig. 2)."

      "text" : "Polysaccharide hydrogels can also be used to realize potential therapeutic applications, e.g., “smart” systems, composed of penetrating polymers at the cellular level, exhibit excellent efficiency for intracellular drug transport. The IPN micro/nanospheres of synthetic and/or biopolymers such as alginate showed excellent entrapment and sustained drug-release characteristics for different anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-coagulant, and anti-biotic drugs as well as pindolol (an anti-hypertensive drug) which is poorly soluble (Matricardi et al. 2013). Pectin/gellan gum composites, developed by ionotropic gelation method, utilizing aluminum as a crosslinker, exhibited improved entrapment characteristics for in vitro targeted transport of ketoprofen (an antiinflammatory drug). Polycaprolactone (PCL)-copolymerizeddextran nano-structures showed in vitro sustained delivery of amoxicillin drug (Prezotti et al. 2014; Saldias et al. 2015).\nCurrent EPS researches are lacking the improvement of steroids administration applying sustained delivery methodologies. Micro/nano-structured delivery of such substances in transdermal delivery systems can reduce various side-effects associated with fist-pass metabolism, high plasma level, and gastrointestinal absorption after administration by attaining significant concentration at minimum drug dose. Their adhesion performance, local tolerance, bioequivalence, and pharmacokinetics are still needed to be investigated.\nCellular carriers and drug targeting\nThe amphiphilic polysaccharide conjugates exhibit specific penetrating and biding characteristics with cellular receptors, which indicate their promising applications in drug-targeting. Hence, cholesterol -pul lu lan nano-s t ructures can hydrophobically bind with β-oligomers of β-amyloid, reducing possible toxic effects. These nano-structures can be used as a complementary strategy in neurological diseases by forming soluble toxic aggregates such as Alzheimer disease (Boridy et al. 2009)."

This modern strategy has been considered as the promising treatment of different disorders such as liver failure and diabetes (Rokstad et al. 2014). Alginate-nanocomposite reinforced with bacterial cellulose nanocrystals was developed with improved chemical and mechanical stability by oxidizing bacterial cellulose at C-6 position in the NaClO/TEMPO/NaBr system as a catalyst. The resulting nanocomposites beads were used for the encapsulation of fibroblast cells. Such nanocomposites are considered as potential therapeutic agents by encapsulating islets tissues to promote insulin secretion (Park et al. 2017a, b). Regenerative medicines have the potential to redevelop damaged portions of the tissues in the living body; it comprises the growth of cells and tissues in the laboratory and implanting them in the patient’s body (Fig. 3).\nModern studies in regenerative medicine focusing on the restoration of pathophysiologically modified tissue architectures using three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds containing bioactive compounds. Polymer scaffolds have been successfully demonstrated for their applications in biomedical engineering, such as the vascular tissues, cartilage, bones, skin, organs and controlled drug, genes and growth factors transport (Liu and Chan-Park 2009; Sun et al. 2011; Sun and Mao 2012; Li et al. 2017). Formation and implantation of cells/tissues using 3D polymer hydrogels/scaffolds are considered as an emerging area in biomedical sciences."

These curdlan-conjugates exhibited sustained transport and reduced overall 70% of tumor volume (Gao et al. 2010). Zhou et al. (2017) also studied the encapsulation of an anti-cancer drug (doxorubicin) in curdlan nanocarriers and described positive results in reducing the cancer volume by minimum absorption in healthy cells. Other biopolymer conjugates such as hyaluronic-cholanic acid nano-structures exhibited a receptor-mediated accretion in cancerous (SSC7) cells.\nHyaluronic acid-based nano-carriers exhibited excellent targeted and sustained transport of vorinostat (an anti-cancer drug) to lung adenocarcinoma and breast adenocarcinoma cells (Wei et al. 2013, 2017). Gellan nanohydrogels have been developed with novel characteristics like the simultaneous transport of\ntwo poorly soluble drugs (chemically linked prednisolone and physically entrapped paclitaxel) for targeted delivery of antiinflammatory and anti-cancer drugs. Transdermal drug transport is an alternative approach to treat skin-related disorders. Nanoemulsions of EPS matrix exhibited an efficient system for both in vivo and in vitro targeted release of methylenedioxycamptothecin to inhibit keloid tumors (Gao et al. 2014).\nThese nano-structured EPS could act as novel adjuvant systems by improving vaccine-induced protection by personalizing immune response and specifically targeting challenging microbes, e.g., viruses (Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome - AIDS and hepatitis C), parasites (e.g., malaria), new influenza strain H1N1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Alternative targeting route is presented by antigen-targeted immunotherapy for cancer cells, provoking an immunogenic reaction that selectively inhibit the growth of tumors. Another promising, still notexplored area among biomedical engineering is the applications\nof multi-functional EPS and drug-conjugates, able to cross blood-brain-barrier for the treatment of early-stage tumors and other neurological disorders."

Cationic dextran-based nano-carriers, associated with photosensitizer, were successfully loaded with siRNA, resulted an effective transfection in hepatoma (Huh-7) cells (Raemdonck et al. 2010). Amino-6-deoxy curdlan loaded with siRNA have also been successfully transfected to the human colon (HCT116) and human lung (H727) cell lines,\nmice stem cells, as well as leukemia monocytes (THP-1) cell lines (Han et al. 2015).\nOther researches focusing on gene-delivery using EPSderivatives have also reported the use of glucans, scleroglucan, schizophyllan, alginate, and gellan gums (Zhang et al. 2013a, b). Polyplexes have also been developed for the transport of nucleic acid material to inspire the morphogenesis of particular cell types to produce desired tissues. Polyplex complex composed of EPSderivatives and DNA has been incorporated in a scaffold. In vivo studies on biopolymer blends suggest that cells encapsulated in polyplex-scaffold exhibit improved gene expression than naked DNA containing scaffolds (Salvay and Shea 2006). Immobilization of DNA polyplexes on EPS-derived scaffold\nsurfaces improved the structural stability of DNA molecules.

It can also be classified as “understanding the principles of tissue-growth and apply this to develop novel functional objects as a replacement, maintenance, repair and improvement of tissue function”. The term “tissue engineering” covers a broad range of applications from repair to replace some portion and even whole tissue, i.e., muscle, bone, cartilage, skin, and bones, etc. Recent advancement in this multidisciplinary area has produced a novel set of tissue implementation strategies. The concept of tissue engineering with EPS-derivatives using two-dimensional (2D) and 3D bioprinting techniques have been presented in Fig. 3.\nSeveral attempts have been made to treat wounds with grafts using various resources. Several researches have been conducted in the early twentieth century to investigate the immunologic basis for tissue rejection of skin allografts, yet there was no progress in this area. During 2nd world war, due to the high number of burn victims, Peter Medawar made an interesting contribution in understanding the immunology of graft rejection (Duquesnoy 2002). Using the technique to culture in vitro epithelial cells of a patient, a whole multi-layered, thick skin can be generated to resurface the whole body of a burn victim. In 1953, it was demonstrated that the product of epidermal tissue culture could be used to graft a bed to reconstruct epidermis (Billingham and Reynolds 1952). Still, research trials are required to develop a more efficient process of cultivation. Green et al. (1979) described the co-culture technique for the cultivation of human epidermis keratinocytes using small biopsy samples."

Hence, there is an urgent need for advanced wound-care materials. Innovative technologies will dramatically accelerate the production of advanced dressing materials for wound healing applications. An efficient would dressing must provide a suitable environment where maximum healing can take place. Dressings are used to cover wounded areas and to provide infection-free healing. Because of increasing demand and awareness, the properties of absorption, maintenance, hemostatic, provision of a suitable environment (water, moisture, and gaseous exchange), painlessness, and the most important, cost-effectiveness have been recognized more critically. Current researches using the polymer membrane is still in its initial stages (Kamoun et al. 2017; Miguel et al. 2017). A well-structured nanocomposite can be manufactured using a variety of different materials such as cellulose and its derivatives (Murphy and Collins 2018; Hasheminya et al. 2019) with polylactic acid (PLA) and other composites.\nCurrent advancements in biomimetic chemistry have created possibilities to fabricate tissues in the laboratory. Apart from non-toxicity and biocompatibility, biodegradability is also a required property for tissue engineering applications. There has been an increasing number of publications related to materials engineering, including blends, composites, nano/ micro-scale scaffolds or fibers, etc. They present a variety of designed characteristics, including mechanical, chemical, or physical, depending upon their final application. The success of the final material depends upon growth onto the polymer surface and the cellular adhesion. Tissue regeneration requires three main key factors: the culture, the growth factor, and the support (Ikada 2006). Since the cell-surface interaction is completely understood, new biomaterials can easily be manufactured."

Biopolymers could be grafted with a specific type of ligand, such as an amino group. Cholesterol-graft-pullulan nanocomposites exhibited high auto-fluorescence in cancerous cells as compared with traditional liposome-quantum dot complexes (Kong et al. 2015; Sarika et al. 2015). Cross-linked aggregates of Fe2O3-dextran containing a large group of functional macromolecules for in vivo molecular diagnostics, e.g., fluorescent molecular tomography (FMT), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diagnostic magnetic resonance (DMR), has been developed (Qiao et al. 2009; Ali et al. 2016). As a diagnostic agent, cross-linked iron oxide-dextran conjugates could be used in photodynamic therapy using a photosensitizer, killing atheromatous plaque cells in carotid arteries (Mbakidi et al. 2015).\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) is used for the treatment of cancerous cells by lowing optical power densities with minimum damage to healthy cells. Various efforts are being made for the improvement of PDT, such as the development of redox-responsive-chlorin conjugated Fe2O3-dextran nanoparticles for magnetic resonance/ near-infrared dual-modality targeting and bioimaging. The fluorescence could be turned “ON” by a self-quenching state of the intracellular environment (Ding et al. 2017). Studies have demonstrated improved in vivo magnetic resonance imaging using different microbial EPS-based nano-structures, indicating the twenty-firstcentury paradigm-shift in biomedical sciences. Another study reported the development of dextran nanoparticles conjugated with hydrophilic porphyrin derivatives as potential theranostic agents for cancer imaging and therapy. Theranostic applications of these diagnostic modalities depend on the body’s\ninternal metabolism and elimination of iron nanoparticles and also require the repeated dose administration.\nSome bioactive EPS and their therapeutic efficacies\nSome EPS and their derivatives exhibit excellent biological activities that indicate their applications as potential therapeutics. β-glucans has gained much attention due to their immunomodulatory effect by interacting with macrophage and activating host defense mechanism against tumor cells, parasites, viruses, and bacteria (Choromanska et al. 2015). The β-glucans also exhibit excellent anti-tumor, anti-viral, antibacterial, and immunopotentiating activities. They also show different activities against some leukemias, colon cancer, chemically induced cancer types, mammary cancer, and sarcomas (Mirza et al. 2017).\nEPS produced by L. theobromae have been studied for their anti-proliferative activity against mammary sarcoma (Alves da Cunha et al. 2012). However, sulfonated derivatives of β-D-glucans have been reported for their antithrombotic and anti-coagulant activities similar to heparin (Vasconcelos et al. 2013). Immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer can be performed by the activation of B and T cells against malignancies. Although these therapies are slower than conventional mode of treatments (radiotherapy or chemotherapy), these are yet specifically durable and adaptable. Therefore, EPSbased immunotherapies could be synergic and valuable anticancer agents.\nEPS (β-D-glucans) produced by Lactobacilli strains and a recombinant Lactococcus lactis exhibited in vitro immunomodulatory effect by activation of macrophages, enhancing the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines (Notararigo et al. 2014). L. paraplantarum produce hetero-polymeric EPS, which showed similar in vitro effect as probiotic agent (Kishimoto et al. 2017). Enterobacter produces EPS composed of acetate, succinate, pyruvate, glucuronic acid, galactose, glucose, and fructose. These EPS showed excellent hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic activities in diabetes (Huang et al. 2015). The corresponding biomarkers and signaling mechanisms are still under study."

Emerging performance technologies are focusing on the development of cost-effective bioactive EPS production with multi-functional characteristics. Microbial EPS-based nano-structures for targeted therapy exhibit certain advantages over conventional delivery systems, e.g., biocompatibility, biodegradability and non-toxic nature. Ye t , t h e y c a nno t b e om i t t e d f r om ne c e s s a r y pharmacotoxicological studies, as the EPS-induced chemical alterations still need to be carefully investigated. One of the most import challenges towards the implementation of EPSbased nanomedicines is to study, in vivo bioavailability to analyze potential drug dosage by analyzing distribution, absorption, metabolism, elimination, and pharmacokinetics of the nanotherapeutics. In this regard, the advancements in EPS-based nano-structures for biomedical imaging systems could be beneficial. Apparently, based on the abovementioned considerations, the EPS-based external drug administration for tissue engineering and wound healing purposes is likely to be approved by passing through in vivo trials.\nNano-structures encapsulated with EPS, and their derivatives showed versatile functionalization and higher stability over liposomes or naked nanoparticles. More researches are needed to be performed to analyze the challenging areas of high interest, such as neurological diseases (Alzheimer’s, tumors, strokes) are expected. Concerning bioactive EPS in theranostics, the challenge is to study, in vivo therapeutic benefits and bioavailability over other medicines available in the market.

    "abstractText" : "Herein, we have presented a broad overview of microbial exopolysaccharide (EPS)-based nano-structures that are continuously being explored for their potential biomedical applications, e.g., cell and/or drug encapsulation, gene delivery, tissue engineering, diagnostics, and related therapeutics. The sustainable exploitation of naturally occurring EPS-based polymeric nano-carriers using state-of-the-art nanotech engineering approaches has provided an excellent alternative to conventional bioimaging and drug delivery technologies. EPS-based drug transport covers a specific niche “intelligent therapeutics” which is still being established and has not been well described in the literature. Thus, herein, an effort has been made to cover this literature gap to present uniquemulti-functional potentialities of microbial EPSwith suitable examples. EPS-based nano-pharmaceutics exhibit certain advantages over conventional counterparts, such as ease in preparation, in vivo biocompatibility, biodegradability, and sustainability. EPS and their derivatives are successfully applied for several biomedical applications, e.g., wound dressing scaffolds, arthritis treatment, dental impressions, and tissue engineering purposes. The progress in targeted delivery systems using micro and nanosystems has opened a new dimension in biopolymer-based biomedicines and smart surgical procedures. This huge area of biomedical engineering is described by the availability of a diverse range of EPS-derivatives, whose multifunctional characteristics can be controlled. Through bioconjugation, i.e., functionalized composite production, different systems have been designed, such as controlled drug release and target accumulation of therapeutic substances. Potential EPS applications are not just limited to targeted transport but also covers several emerging diagnostic technologies. Several bioactive EPS have also been studied for their properties like anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-tumor and immunomodulatory activities. Based on currently available data on EPS-based nano-structures for biomedical domains, it can be undoubtedly stated that they present a broad future ahead.",
