      "text" : "The chemical and associated industries of the twentyfirst century tend to produce very complex products in a greener, sustainable, and environmentally friendlier way to give solutions to public demands concerning food, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and fine chemical companies [1,2]. In this context, enzymes have found their natural niche as industrial biocatalysts [3]. They are highly efficient and versatile biological catalysts or biocatalysts that display high chemo-, stereo-, and region-selectivity under the ambient environment [4,5]. Using enzymes as catalysts, reactions of multifunctional molecules are preceded without activation or protection/deprotection of the functional groups required in traditional organic syntheses [6]. Based on literature evidence, enzyme-based catalytic processes have numerous advantages over conventional-based synthetic routes. Thus, enzyme-mediated catalytic bioprocesses\nare becoming increasingly important in large-scale industrial and biotechnological applications [7]. Nevertheless, the deployment of enzymes in original form is often handicapped by several limitations such as high cost, low-functional stability, and no recovery or recyclability [8–14].\nDue to advancements in genetic modification and tailoring techniques and tools to improve enzyme performance, biocatalysis has experienced an accelerating development over the last several years. For example, enzyme versatility and catalytic properties have been improved through site-directed mutagenesis [15]. Similarly, techniques of directed evolution have now made it possible to mimic natural evolution which targets the desired enzyme property [16]. Metagenomic tools allow access to novel biocatalysts from organisms that are not cultivable; for instance, extremophiles are presently a novel source of industrially-pertinent enzymes that are functional under extreme conditions [17].\nCONTACT Hairong Cheng chrqrq@sjtu.edu.cn State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China; Hafiz M.

Immobilization of the enzymes on different types of carriers provides one of the most attractive concepts to overcome these drawbacks [18–20]. In recent years, many researchers have pursued immobilization as a noteworthy engineering tool to tailor and improve a plethora of enzyme catalytic features, such as activity, selectivity, specificity, resistance to inhibitors. Physical and chemical based enzyme immobilization methods along with considerable limitations and potentialities are shown in Figure 1.\nA proper immobilization system may lead to improved enzyme stability toward harsh reaction conditions such as extreme pH, high temperature, or the presence of organic solvents, which facilitates easier separation from the reaction media [21–23]. Additionally, product contamination with enzymes can be diminished or completely circumvented, which is particularly crucial for application in the pharmaceutical and food industries [24]. By careful control of the immobilization matrix or operating conditions, some immobilization procedures, in certain cases, have allowed the simultaneous purification and immobilization of enzymes from the crude extract [3].\nImmobilization is considered promising for industrial scale applications, since it allows continuous processes, for example in fixed-bed bioreactors. Figure 2 illustrates a schematic pathway of enzyme screening to immobilization with novel features for scale up to the industrial level [14]. Considering the difference in the type and character of the interactions, immobilization techniques can be categorized into adsorption, entrapment, encapsulation, covalent binding, and cross-linking [6,25,26]. Nevertheless, selection of the appropriate carrier support is the most crucial challenge due to its\nconsiderable impact on the properties of the biomolecules and catalytic system. Important parameters that define a suitable support includes the internal geometry (e.g. smooth surfaces or thin fibers), mechanical resistance, pore diameter, specific surface area, and activation degree [25]. The interaction of one group in the carrier support with the biocatalyst, in some instances, is sufficient to fix the enzyme to the support, whereas in many cases, it is indispensable to create the interaction of several groups of the support with several groups of the enzyme [27]. Further, researchers must also detect and establish tools to detect phenomena (desired or undesired) occurred after immobilization. Initially, immobilization may occur through a one-point or a multipoint interaction. However, the number of the interactions with the support continually increased after immobilization, involving new groups as it is the case for hetero-functional supports [28]. Epoxy-based support reactivity is not very high, and thus, they react too slowly to permit full immobilization in a reasonable time period even at pH 10 [3]. Moreover, enzyme stabilizations, using epoxy-activated supports, are lower than that obtained, using glyoxyl supports, under comparable conditions, such as support activation degree, nature, and enzyme orientation [3,29].\nFrom the orientation view point, a major concern is that the molecules are randomly oriented on the surface [30]. As a consequence, to this random orientation, the active sites of immobilized enzyme molecules are not accessible in order to target in the solution phase. This enzyme orientation is even critical if the active site needs to have a proper connection with the support surface. For instance, there is a requirement in redox enzymes, to fulfill the need to transfer or receive electrons to or from the support [27]. Moreover, the possibility of enzyme denaturation is also higher if there is a\nFigure 2. A schematic pathway of enzyme screening to immobilization with novel features to scale up to the industrial level (Reproduced from Bilal et al. [14], with permission from Elsevier).\nstrong interaction between randomly immobilized enzymes and surface. The generation of steric hindrance by support due to the very large substrate molecules is also an important consideration that makes protein orientation critical. Therefore, in many earlier studies, the importance of selective immobilization of enzyme molecules along with the coupled use of sitedirected mutagenesis with a proper orientational control on the support surface has been recognized [27,31,32]. The controlled orientation has been shown to possess higher activity and stability than that of random orientation [33,34]. Earlier reviews by Butterfield et al. [35] and Hernandez and Fernandez-Lafuente [27] comprehensively focused on how different immobilization methods may yield different oriented enzyme molecules.\nEarlier, Barbosa et al. [28] reviewed and presented the development of tailor-made hetero-functional supports to obtain specific immobilization of target proteins. Recently, Santos et al. [29] developed an agarose-based novel support activated with divinylsulfone (DVS) as a tool to immobilize and stabilize enzymes via multipoint covalent attachment. Aiming to improve the stability, such DVS-activated supports seem promising and quite stable over a broader pH range 5–10 at 25 C during wet conditions. According to Santos et al. [29], the DVS-activated agarose-based novel support can react rapidly with the a-amides of Cys and His, at pH 5–10, with Lys mainly at pH 10 and with Tyr in a much slower fashion. Following that, the same group has also developed DVS-activated octyl agarose beads-based hetero-functional support by introducing vinyl sulfone groups onto the support surface [36]. The DVS groups are very stable and have noteworthy potentialities to react with other available functional groups including primary and secondary amino groups along with hydroxyl, imidazole, or thiol groups [29]. This high reactivity potential thus permits the long-term immobilization and makes DVS-based supports novel candidates to produce a rapid and intense multipoint covalent enzyme attachment [29,36]."

      "text" : "Figure 3 illustrates a schematic representation of multipoint enzyme immobilization strategies. Covalent binding is one of the most prevalent and interesting techniques to immobilize enzymes for industrial-scale applications [37]. It involves a chemical reaction through which enzymes are either covalently bonded with nanomatrix or, using bi-functional reagents, they attach the enzyme at one side and immobilization\nsupport on the other [8]. As the chemical reaction often confirms that the covalent binding does not mask the enzyme’s catalytic site, the enzyme activity remains unaffected by such a type of immobilization technique. The activity of the covalently attached enzyme depends on carrier material size, shape and composition, and the nature and specific conditions of the coupling reaction. In this technique, the enzyme can be immobilized via multipoint covalent attachments with immobilization support to enhance activity, stability, and reusability characteristics [38]. Covalent bonding typically occurs between reactive chemical groups on the support surface and nucleophilic groups on the enzymes. The reactive functional groups can be added to the support matrix without modification, or the support matrix is functionalized to generate activated groups. Various functional groups, from a surface chemistry viewpoint, are shown in Figure 4. Most enzymes are covalently attached using their lysine amino groups because of a frequent presence on the protein surface and high reactivity [37]. Chemically, covalent coupling provides a strong connection between the carrier matrix and the biocatalyst, prevents the enzyme from leaching into the reaction environment, and allows greater repeated use than other immobilization procedures [39]. Nonetheless, multipoint or multisubunit attachment of enzymes on highly activated support materials through very short spacer arms and a number\nof residues on the enzyme surface is required to obtain full advantage of the immobilization. In this case, the relative spaces/distances among all residues engaged in multipoint attachment have to be retained unaltered during conformational modifications induced by a distorting agent such as higher pH, heat, or organic solvents. In this way, conformational changes involved in enzyme denaturation are diminished and the resulting covalently coupled biocatalyst may display high stability. In earlier reports, an array of enzymes of different groups has been greatly stabilized following a multipoint covalent attachment method than that of onepoint immobilized equivalents [40]. Mateo et al. [21] revealed that covalent immobilization might be the ideal choice if a multipoint coupling of the biocatalyst is achieved onto the support surface. A good geometrical congruence of support with the enzyme is essential to establish strong multipoint covalent enzyme immobilization. The reactive groups on the support must exhibit pronounced stability under the reaction environments, minimum steric hindrances, and an ability to react with enzyme groups frequently present on the surface of the enzyme (e.g. lysine) [41]. After the immobilization reaction, the support should be sufficiently inert to prevent the generation of undesired interactions between the support material and the enzyme molecule [21]. For optimum multipoint covalent coupling, the immobilization conditions should favor enzyme-support reactivity: long reaction times, alkaline pH, and moderately high temperatures [41]. It\nis promising to attach enzymes onto support surface having abundant reactive groups, and this can be realized by the use of glyoxyl supports, due to the reversibility of the one-point imino attachment [21]. Importantly, the highest support–enzyme interaction will not always yield the highest enzyme stability, depending on the surface of the enzyme involved in the immobilization process [21]. The multipoint immobilization technique also improves enzyme thermal and storage stability when attached to different nano-supports such as mesoporous silica, chitosan. Localization of the enzyme on the carrier support surface additionally augments enzyme loading and attachment. On the contrary, immobilized enzymes are often deactivated due to the conformational restriction by random covalent linkages.\nMany different carriers have been engineered to serve as a suitable support for covalent immobilization, including silica-based supports such as kaolinite or mesoporous silica nanoparticles [42]. Glutaraldehyde-, glyoxal-, and epoxy-activated supports are considered to be the best options for attaining this goal [21,43]. Immobilization methods, using glutaraldehyde as the activating agent, are simple, efficient, and perhaps the most widely adopted technique for enzyme insolubilization/immobilization [44]. Supports activated with glutaraldehyde are proposed to mainly react with nonionized primary amino groups, though it may ultimately react with other groups including imidazoles, phenols, and thiols [45]. Immobilization on glutaraldehyde-activated supports is generally carried out at neutral pH because of the low stability of the glutaraldehyde groups at alkaline pH. At neutral pH, the highly reactive amino group in the protein molecule tends to be the terminal amino group. Nevertheless, if some nucleophiles of the proteins are in the area exposed to the support after the first immobilization, the high apparent concentration of the different groups may develop some new covalent linkages between the enzyme molecule and carrier support [46]. Therefore, it might be plausible to reach some multipoint covalent immobilization using the most glutaraldehyde-functionalized support matrices [43].\nThe current situation for using glutaraldehyde-activated supports is far more complicated due to their multifunctional nature. This multifunctionality might be a beneficial aspect in certain conditions. The rapid ionic exchange of the enzyme on the surface of support avoids the enzyme from longer staying in soluble form before being insolubilized, resulting in reduced inactivation of native enzymes via precipitation or proteolysis [21]. Moreover, enzyme deactivation by distortion is\nalso prevented if enzyme adsorption has a constructive impact on its stabilization. The alteration of the enzyme orientation on the carrier support by varying the immobilization conditions is an additional benefit of glutaraldehyde multifunctionality. There are diverse techniques for the immobilization of enzyme on glutaraldehydeactivated supports, leading to different orientations of the enzyme on the support and, as a result, different stabilities of the different immobilized enzyme preparations [43].\nNotably, the enzymes can be immobilized by three different mechanisms depending on the conditions employed during the immobilization process with glutaraldehyde-functionalized supports. When applying very high ionic strength, the protein may first be immobilized by hydrophobic adsorption before establishing the covalent linkages, whereas primary immobilization would be by anion exchange in case of low ionic strength. In moderate ionic strength, enzyme attachment is mainly expected due to the establishment of covalent linkages [3]. Liu et al. [47] used glutaraldehyde-activated silica nanoparticles as a novel carrier support for the covalent attachment of laccase enzymes. The nanoparticles-anchored enzyme possessed enhanced thermal and operational stabilities retaining 61% of the residual activity at 60 C after 4 h and 55% after the repeated usage of 10 operational cycles. Several other types of fibers and polymers have also been attempted for covalent immobilization. For example, laccase from Cerrena unicolor was immobilized on a copolymer of butyl acrylate and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate functionalized with glutaraldehyde, divinyl sulfone, and carbodiimide. The glutaraldehydecrosslinked support proved to be the most effective conferring significant enhancement of operational stability at 30 C in a packed bed reactor [48].\nStabilization of multimeric enzymes via immobilization using different support materials\nThe stabilization of multimeric enzymes is a complex problem [4]. Among many interesting multimeric enzymes such as dehydrogenases, oxidases, galactosidases, catalases, and aldolases [49,50], the dissociation of subunits or the loss of assembly structure is considered a first step in their inactivation [51,52]. Nevertheless, under a different working environment, the multimeric enzymes may tend to dissociate due to the weaken subunit–subunit interactions which ultimately cause rapid inactivation [4]. In this context, the prevention of subunit dissociation is of high interest\nwhile trying to stabilize multimeric enzyme molecules [53]. So far, several approaches have been developed and well reported for a said purpose including medium engineering, chemical crosslinking, protein engineering, and enzyme immobilization using different support materials [4].\nAgarose functionalized with glyoxyl groups has been reported to be a suitable carrier support for the multipoint covalent attachment of enzymes, permitting the complete structural stabilization by achieving a high degree of rigidity. Multipoint covalent coupling of multimeric proteins may prevent subunit dissociation by inter-subunit cross-linking combined with circumventing conformational inactivation by intra-subunit crosslinking. In this process, amino groups present on the surface of the enzymes react with highly reactive aldehydes from glyoxyl to constitute reversible imino bonds [54]. L opez-Gallego et al. [55] reported a high level of stabilization of the glutaryl-7-aminocephalosporanic acid acylase enzyme through multipoint covalent immobilization onto amino-epoxy SepabeadsTM. The greater stability was attributed to the tyrosines reaction with the support addition to lysine moieties which typically reacts with glyoxyl groups. Similarly, enhanced structural and functional stabilization, as well as the prevention of subunit dissociation of different multimeric alcohol oxidases, was achieved by multipoint immobilization onto glyoxyl-agarose followed by postimmobilization via inter-subunit cross-linking with aldehyde–dextran [56]. In another study, Bernal et al. [57] attempted the multipoint covalent immobilization of b-galactosidase on glyoxyl groups activated by macromesoporous silica to improve the thermal stability characteristics for producing galacto-oligosaccharides. They observed that the thermal stability was directly influenced by the concentration of glyoxyl groups on the surface of the support, porous silica particles, because at lower concentrations of glyoxyl groups, the enzyme rigidification was found to be insufficient and thereby reduced thermal stabilization, whereas the tertiary structure of the enzyme was also destabilized at the excessive rigidification of the enzyme molecule. It is demonstrated that the lesser number of attachments between protein molecule and support matrix may impede an optimal rigidification of the protein tertiary structure, thus evading a high-level stabilization of the attached protein [58].\nEpoxy groups appear to be ideal entities to give intense enzyme–support multipoint coupling resulting in remarkable stabilization factors in some instances [59]. Epoxy-modified supports may react with amino and carboxylic groups present on a protein without\ndeteriorating the enzyme activity and described to be the first approximation to develop fine-tuned heterofunctional supports. They can also react with many other groups including hydroxyl, phenol, or thiol groups. In addition to good stability, and high activity, epoxy groups have short spacer arms and exhibit low steric hindrances for reacting with protein molecules [60]. Worthy to mention is that epoxy-hetero-functional supports can immobilize enzymes at any pH value, rendering it easy to find immobilization causes far more rapidly than the epoxy covalent reaction [60].\nChoice of nano-based platforms for enzyme/ biomolecules immobilization\nThe possibilities and prospects of immobilized enzymes for commercial purposes are continually growing. Based on these possibilities, researchers have rekindled their interest to discover and precisely tailor unique support materials with novel catalytic properties for biomolecule immobilization. These support materials of organic or inorganic origin are characterized by intriguing chemical and thermal steadiness and desired mechanical properties. The development of support materials with diverse morphological shapes and controlled particle sizes renders them appropriate for the immobilization of different enzymes. Moreover, these\nmaterials are endowed with significant quantities of various functional groups which facilitate surface modification and enzyme binding. Hence, the control of biotechnological process can be improved with the use of these novel enzyme supports can achieve an immobilized biocatalytic system with improved catalytic efficiency and increased quality and purity of the reaction products compared to conventional support materials (Figure 5) [12,61].\nNon-magnetic nanoparticles as host for enzyme immobilization\nIn recent years, nanoparticles (both inorganic and organic origin) with diameters up to 30 nm have been widely employed as potential support materials for the immobilization of several enzymes. Nanoparticles offer a wide surface area for enzyme attachment resulting in higher enzyme loading on the matrix surface and an improved immobilization yield along with other advantages (Figure 6). Major advantages of nanoparticles and other inorganic materials are their capacity to minimize diffusional restrictions. Particularly, active sites of enzyme molecules attached to the surface of the nonporous particles are reported for broader contact with their reacting substrates. This trait indicates the high catalytic activity and functionality of\nFigure 5. Biocatalytic evaluation and improvement strategies.

Low-substrate conversion can be significantly induced following enzyme engineering (Reproduced from Bilal et al. [12], with permission from Elsevier).\nnanoparticles-based biocatalytic systems for diverse applications [62,63]. Table 1 illustrates the immobilization of different enzymes on some common nanoparticles that have been employed in recent years and their improved catalytic features for industrial applications.\nA variety of inorganic nanomaterials such as nanogold and graphene can be employed as support matrices for enzyme immobilization [71,72]. However, inorganic oxide nanoparticles are most frequently used as catalytic supports. For instance, Hou et al. [73] used glutaraldehyde-activated titania nanoparticles as a matrix for the attachment of carbonic anhydrase, and the resulting immobilized biocatalytic system was used for biomimetic conversion of CO2. In another study, octyltriethoxysilane and glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane-functionalized silica nanoparticles were used for the covalent binding of lipase from Rhizomucor miehei. The immobilized lipase has been shown to be a very stable biocatalyst and achieved over 90% of biocatalytic activity retention [74]. Chen et al. [69] immobilized lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia on zirconia nanoparticles functionalized with various carboxylic acids, i.e. linoleic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, valeric acid, and 1,10-decanedicarboxylic acid. The original catalytic\nactivity of the zirconia-embedded enzyme was 10.5 and 16.6 times enhanced compared to the native and crude lipase powder, respectively. The Mucor janaicus lipase (MJL) covalently bonded to ethylenediamine (EDA)-activated silica nanoparticles and exhibited high-enzyme loading efficiency and catalytic activity. In addition to wide pH ranges, tolerance, and high thermal stability, the relative activity of the EDA-NCS silica carrier immobilized lipase was increased to 107% in contrast to the free counterpart [75]. Recently, the laccase enzyme was effectively immobilized in silver nanoparticles fabricated in the presence of either poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), or chitosan as the stabilizing agent. Though enzyme activity was reduced, AgNPs–polymer-conjugated laccase exhibited substantial improvement in stability up to 13 days at a high temperature of 50 C [64].\nMagnetic nanoparticles as a host for enzyme immobilization\nAfter biocatalytic processes, the separation of immobilized biocatalysts from the enzymatic reaction mixture is one of the key challenges that need to be overcome for immobilization. At this juncture, associating\nFigure 6. Comparative evaluation of free/crude- and nanoparticle-based immobilized enzymes. Nano-based immobilization combines the advantages of both systems which ultimately leads to a diverse field of applications.\nbiomolecules to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) provides a facile separation of the biocatalytic system by the use of an external magnetic field. In recent decades, MNPs have received massive attention as attractive support materials for enzyme immobilization due to their large surface area and the presence of hydroxyl groups on their surface which enables their easy functionalization and strong binding of the enzyme molecule. Low porosity and exceptional mechanical stability are the characteristic features which reduce steric hindrances and are important for the development of a stabilized enzyme–matrix catalytic system [76]. All these features led to substantial improvement in loading capacity of enzymes or biomolecules. Importantly, their magnetic properties can assure the easy separation and recovery of the immobilized enzymes for continual uses, and immobilization processes can be greatly simplified [77]. Table 2 summarizes various magnetic nanoparticles utilized for the immobilization of different enzymes and their catalytic trait improvement for biotechnological applications.\nGraphene-based nanomaterials as host for enzyme immobilization\nGraphene and graphene oxide (GO) have attracted a great deal of attention as particularly useful\nnanostructured materials for biomolecule immobilization due to their unique characteristics such as biodegradability, notable chemical and thermal stability, high surface area, and pore volume. The occurrence of various functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carboxylic, or epoxide groups, enables the formation of strong enzyme–matrix interactions without the use of crosslinking agents or modification of the graphene surface [86]. All these features discussed above create graphene-based nanomaterials as an ideal matrix for peroxidases or lipases immobilization by adsorption, entrapment, or covalent binding with tailor-made properties and improved enzyme activities [87]. The antioxidant properties of graphene supports may protect enzyme molecules from inactivation by eliminating free radicals from the reaction mixtures [88]. In a recent study, D-psicose 3-epimerase (DPEase) was immobilized on pristine GO and employed for the biosynthesis of rare sugar D-psicose. The efficiency of immobilized DPEase-mediated conversion of D-fructose to D-psicose was considerably enhanced. Thermal resistance capability of the GO-bounded enzyme was also improved, as the immobilized enzyme derivative exhibited 180 times higher half-life in contrast to free DPEase [89]. In another study, plant-based horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was covalently attached to reduced GO nanoparticles activated with glutaraldehyde. The GO-\nconjugated HRP displayed improvement of the catalytic properties, i.e. enhanced turnover number (kcat) and catalytic efficiency after its attachment. Further, the reusability profile indicated that immobilized HRP retained over 70% of its original catalytic activity after 10 repeated substrate oxidation cycles [90]. Ormategui et al. [91] designed an efficient, stable, and nanobiocatalytic system by covalently immobilizing a laccase enzyme on reduced GO composite hydrogel. The functional performance of the resultant nanobiocatalysts was investigated in the degradation of the Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) dye in aqueous solution. The GObound laccase exhibited potential dye decolorization capability and preserved high catalytic stability in four consecutive dye degradation batches. In conclusion, the use of graphene-based nanomaterials appeared as suitable supports for the immobilization of various enzymes of different groups with promising industrial scale implementation. They also unveil the possibility of creating a novel nanobiocatalyst for applications in delignification for biofuels, environmental remediation,\nthe food and textile industry, and pulp and paper processing.\nMesoporous materials as a carrier support\nDuring the last two decades, mesoporous materials have appeared as potential support candidates for the immobilization of a wide variety of enzymes which may lead to an improved catalytic stability, activity, and reusability of the tested enzyme. The characteristic properties that differentiate mesoporous materials from other immobilization matrices for biomolecules immobilization are the possibility of fine-tuning the properties of the support by modifying the synthesis conditions and developing matrices with a desired pore size and structure [92]. These types of carriers comprehend mesopores with 2–50 nm diameter, narrow and tunable pore distribution, high-specific surface areas (1500 m2/g), and pore volumes (1.5 cm3/g) [93]. These features constitute mesoporous materials as perfect supports for the immobilization of various biomolecules\nand enzymes by encapsulation, covalent binding, or cross-linking aggregates (Table 3). In either of the immobilization techniques, the enzyme is entangled in the pores of the support, and in this way, the structure of the enzymes/protein is protected accompanied by significant catalytic potentialities. However, diffusional limitations should be considered during enzyme immobilization in the pores of the mesoporous carrier because of the restricted transport of substrates and products. Given water insolubility, chemical and thermal stability, and the presence of enough chemical groups for biomolecules/biocatalyst binding, mesoporous materials potentially fulfill the requisites for enzyme carriers [94].\nMesoporous groups comprise materials such as carbons, zeolites, and sol-gel matrices, as well as precipitated and ordered mesoporous oxides, and have frequently been attempted for biomolecule immobilization [95]. Lipases from Candida rugosa and C. antarctica were immobilized on MCM 41 and SBA 15 mesoporous silica, respectively, without any intermediate agents and used as catalysts in organic syntheses [96]. The resulted insolubilized enzymes presented improved reusability potential and could be recycled for five reaction cycles\nwithout any loss in their original activities. Zhuang et al. [97] immobilized an alkaline protease on SBA 15 and MCM 41 silicas by adsorption method. SBA 15 silica adsorption led to a maximum loading of 589.43mg/g by the immobilized enzyme, and the immobilization products also had good pH and thermal stability. Similarly, the covalently attached tyrosinase enzyme on the mesoporous silica MCM-41 was employed for the detection of phenol by Mangrulkar et al. [98].\nTo date, a variety of enzymes from different categories, i.e. oxidoreductases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, have been immobilized on mesoporous-based support materials. Though the mainstream of these immobilized enzymes is merely assayed via standard activity protocols, there are an array of recent studies reporting the application of mesoporous-immobilized enzymes in biocatalysis and biofuel cells. For instance, cellulase covalently coupled to mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) effectively hydrolyzed the pretreated cellulose to glucose achieving a constant yield of higher than 80% [99]. In another study, a-amylase was covalently immobilized in SBA-15, MCM-41, and mesostructured cellular foams (MCFs) [100]. Results showed that MCFcoupled derivative displayed the highest specific\nactivity of more than 80% than native enzyme. Moreover, pH and thermal stability of the immobilized biocatalyst was substantially improved. Laccase covalently attached on amino-functionalized SBA-15 has shown great potential for the oxidation and degradation of four phenolic compounds, and therefore considered important tools for the treatment of olive mill wastewater [42]. In recent years, much interest is growing with enzyme-mediated biofuel cells, in particular, for microchips, biosensors, drug delivery, implantable devices, and portable power supplies. Insufficient power density, shelf life, and functional stability are the major hindrances in the engineering and development of powerful biofuel cells. Enzyme immobilization using OMSs has obvious advantageous for biosensor devices, which are important building blocks in the assembly of biofuel cells. In this milieu, the application of the OMSsbased bioelectrocatalytic systems in biofuel cells is expected to be of the novel solutions with constructive effects on overwhelming the current bottleneck due to the increased enzyme loading and stability characteristics [75]. Despite great perspectives, several challenges remain to be solved for cost-effective employment of these biocatalytic systems during large-scale manufacturing of specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals, bioenergy conversion, and biosensors development. Further comprehensive and sophisticated studies of enzyme immobilization through several different methodologies in novel ordered mesoporous materials (OMMs), and novel OMMs and characterization of the engineered biocatalyst are necessitated.\nCeramic materials as carrier support\nCeramic materials are considered very promising support materials for diverse applications of immobilized enzymes owing to their high resistance to temperature, pressure and organic solvents, and exceptional mechanical durability [101]. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of ceramic-based materials favors the adsorption immobilization of enzymes. Nevertheless, additional surface functionalization is required for the covalent attachment of biomolecules including enzymes on ceramic materials. Ceramic materials such as alumina, zirconia, titania, silica, iron oxide, and calcium phosphate have been used either in the form of ceramic foam or composite (TiO2/Al2O3) ceramic membranes as effective biomolecule carriers [102]. Ebrahimi et al. [103] immobilized b-galactosidase using ceramic membrane as a support material to catalyze a transgalactosylation reaction of lactose to generate galactosyloligosaccharides. The ceramic-assisted biocatalytic\nsystem was used for continuous formation of oligosaccharides, and its efficiency increased to 40% under optimum operating conditions. Wang et al. [104] used Nb-amino-ethyl-g-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane-functionalized ceramic material (cordierite) for the covalent immobilization of HRP. The carrier-supported enzyme system achieved nearly 92% oil removal efficiency from wastewater with good repeated use capability.\nElectrospun polymer-based fibers as carrier support\nElectrospinning can be used as a simple solution to enzyme immobilization for broad-spectrum applications in many aspects such as catalysis, filtration, biosensors, biofuel cell systems, optical and electronic devices, and biomedical applications. Electrospun nanofibers possess unique characteristics and superiority especially their applications in the arena of biocatalysis. The considerable perspective of electrospun materials as supports for enzyme immobilization arises from many structural and functional advantages such as length, diameter uniformity, and compositional diversity. In addition, high porosity and surface areas lead to profound enzyme loadings, whereas reduced diffusional limitations and low hindrance of mass transfer are related to nanometer sizes of these materials [105]. Electrospun nanomaterials are also popular for other useful properties including nontoxicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and higher mechanical strength, which render them attractive matrices for different kinds of biocatalysts [106]. The properties of electrospun materials can be easily tailored to favor enzyme binding and increase the catalytic activity of the biocatalyst due to the availability of several functional moieties on their surface [107]. It is demonstrated that electrospun carriers can be generated by a wide range of synthetic polymers such as polyacrylamide, polystyrene, polyurethane, and poly(vinyl alcohol), as well as biocompatible polymers including alginate, chitosan, and cellulose [108]. The biomolecules or enzymes can be attached to these materials by surface attachment, encapsulation, or covalent binding depending on the support properties [109]. Table 4 portrays typical illustrations of enzyme immobilization on electrospun nanofiber-based support materials and corresponding improvements in their catalytic features.\nRecently, S oti et al. [120] used polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers in the form of a membrane to immobilize C. antarctica lipase B by surface attachment. The polyvinyl alcohol membrane-adsorbed lipase retained superior catalytic activity, higher enantiomer selectivity,\nand excellent stability to 10 reaction cycles. In another study, five different types of lipase were entrapped for the resolution of racemic secondary alcohols by acylation in inorganic media. Interestingly, the activity of all lipases under study was improved by stabilizing the three-dimensional conformation of the enzyme. Additionally, the turnover frequency of the reaction increased due to reduced mass transfer restrictions after immobilization which directly correlated with the structural properties of the polymeric nanofibers [121]. Recently, Canbolat et al. [122] encapsulated catalase on poly(e-caprolactone) by adopting a layering technique. Before immobilization, catalase molecules were amalgamated with the cyclic oligosaccharide cyclodextrin to enhance its catalytic properties. The addition of cyclic oligosaccharides exerted a favorable impact on the catalytic activity of the immobilized enzyme, and the\nresulting encapsulated enzyme exhibited greater stability due to the protecting effects from the assay conditions. The electrospun chitosan fabricated nanofibers, using NanospiderTM technology, was exploited for covalent immobilization of trypsin. As excellent biocompatible support material, immobilized trypsin demonstrated the highest activity (548–874 IU/mg of nanofibers), durable storage stability, and high repeatability. Further, covalently bonded enzyme exhibited no cytotoxicity toward the growth of HeLa cells. Trypsin, entrapped into electrospun nanofibers of poly(-caprolactone), presented satisfactory operational stability and preserved 59% of its original activity after five repeated cycles (batches). The thermal and storage stabilities of the immobilized enzyme were greatly improved in contrast to a non-immobilized form of the enzyme.\nSurface characterization and requisite features\nThe appropriate orientation and biologically active three-dimensional conformation of immobilized enzymes are critical to retaining their high catalytic activities and stabilities. Most of the immobilization processes do not actively control the orientation of enzymes. After an immobilization procedure, biomolecules, i.e. enzymes, undergo considerable changes in the surface microenvironment, structure, and protein refolding. This rationale could demonstrate the markedly reduced activity and stability which often occurs following enzyme attachment to immobilization surfaces [14]. Therefore, development of individual biomolecules, their surface orientation and functionalities, and the homogeneity of the surface coverage might be noteworthy cues to develop sophisticated biocatalyst with wide-ranging industrial and biotechnological perspectives.\nElectron microscopy is the only technique available to acquire surface information on the materials at both the micro- and nano-structural scales. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) provides two important improvements over the optical microscope. First, it encompasses the resolution limits up to 30,000 or as high as 60,000 , and improved penetration of the field by an approximate factor of 300. The development of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) – a drive to improve SEM technology has shown ultrahigh and sensational resolution over the entire accelerating voltage range by the remarkable improvements in secondary electron detector technology! It can be employed with greater flexibility for an array of analytical applications. The SEM and FESEM are the most widely used techniques to envisage and distinguish the entire topographical or morphological surface of immobilized enzymes and the associated support material used for enzyme immobilization [123].\nThe structural details can also be elucidated and characterized by the use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM); however, it reveals only two-dimensional analysis of the solid structure [124]. Currently, TEM has appeared as a high-priority analytical technique, since the structural dimension measurements are rapidly approaching the nanometer length scale in both chemistry and material sciences that are beyond the diffraction limits of other methods. During the enzyme immobilization process, envisaging the enzyme molecule distribution onto the carrier support is a significant parameter and correlated with the biocatalysts approachability to the substrate [125]. In addition, the particle magnitude and morphology of the immobilized sample can also be obtained by TEM analysis [82].\nThermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) is used to measure the physical properties of a substance or its reaction products as a function of temperature by subjecting the substance to a controlled temperature program. The TG analysis provides information about reaction rates, oxidation and kinetics of decomposition, quantitative determination of components, and the thermal steadiness of the sample [126]. TGA is a very useful technique for many industries and also applicable in biotechnology, environment, food science, petrochemical, and therapeutic applications. In the immobilization process, TGA is frequently used to portray modification in the thermal constancy of the immobilization matrix [127]. Moreover, the new structure of the immobilized enzyme or the support of choice can be estimated in enzyme immobilization studies by TGA [128]. Following an enzyme immobilization process, the number of functional groups attached to the support material, i.e. the degree of functionalization, can also be determined [129]. This characteristic feature of TGA helps to confirm effectiveness and success of the enzyme immobilization procedure.\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) or scanning force microscopy (SFM) is a true three-dimensional topographic technique able to measure and visualize biomolecules at the single-molecule level even at the sub-nanometer scale. Due to the high resolution, this imaging technique is extensively applied in singlemolecule visualization, protein–protein interfaces, bioelectronics, biosensors, and drug screening [130]. The surface topology of enzyme molecules attached on the biocompatible surface of the supporting carrier, adhesion, dynamics, and other useful properties of biosamples can efficiently be visualized [23]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) or electron spectroscopy demonstrates the chemical, elemental, or molecular analysis of immobilized enzymes or biomolecules. The information about surface layers or thin film structures obtained through XPS study is valuable in myriads of biotechnological applications such as adhesion, catalysis, polymer surface functionalization, semiconductor, electronics, and thin film coating packaging [131,132]."

      "heading" : "Conclusions and future outlook",
      "text" : "Nanomaterials have rapidly emerged as one of the most widely investigated supports owing to their unique structural features, multivalent functionalization and outstanding chemical, mechanical, and electrical properties. The noteworthy advancement in fabrication and surface engineering of nanomaterials has unveiled new opportunities to explore their applications as\nnanoscaffolds for the construction of nanobiocatalytic systems. These novel nano-bioconjugates differ from conventional immobilized enzymes in terms of their functional stability, catalytic activity, and application perspective.\nAlthough extensive progress has been made in the field of nanobiotechnology over the past few years, some critical problems still need to be overcome to further expand the utilization of nanomaterials as carrier matrices for biomolecule immobilization. It is significant to obtain deeper insight and acquaintance of the effects of nanomaterials on the structure and function of proteins, enzymes, and biomolecules. For example, detailed investigation of the influence of the structure on constructed nano supports, and the type of activation agent or functionalization on the loading efficiency and orientation of bounded proteins will lead to the development and optimization of a stabilized nanobiocatalytic system. Moreover, re-engineering and designing of new nano-based materials with fine-tuned structural properties and functionalities exhibiting minimum toxicity, high biocompatibility, and insignificant environmental effects accompanied by the selection of suitable immobilizations method might lead to a functional nanobiocatalytic systems in the field of industrial biocatalysis and biotransformation, organic syntheses, enzyme-mediated biosensing, and biofuel and energy production."

    "abstractText" : "Engineering enzymes with improved catalytic properties in non-natural environments have been concerned with their diverse industrial and biotechnological applications. Immobilization represents a promising but straightforward route, and immobilized biocatalysts often display higher activities and stabilities compared to free enzymes. Owing to their unique physicochemical characteristics, including the high-specific surface area, exceptional chemical, electrical, and mechanical properties, efficient enzyme loading, and multivalent functionalization, nano-based materials are postulated as suitable carriers for biomolecules or enzyme immobilization. Enzymes immobilized on nanomaterial-based supports are more robust, stable, and recoverable than their pristine counterparts, and are even used for continuous catalytic processes. Furthermore, the unique intrinsic properties of nanomaterials, particularly nanoparticles, also confer the immobilized enzymes to be used for their broader applications. Herein, an effort has been made to present novel potentialities of multi-point enzyme immobilization in the current biotechnological sector. Various nano-based platforms for enzyme/biomolecule immobilization are discussed in the second part of the review. In summary, recent developments in the use of nanomaterials as new carriers to construct robust nano-biocatalytic systems are reviewed, and future trends are pointed out in this article.
