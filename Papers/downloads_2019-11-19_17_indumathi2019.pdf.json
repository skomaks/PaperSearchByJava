      "text" : "Packaging technology plays a vital role with respect to food packaging and has been the area of interest for packed food manufacturing industries over the past few decades. Synthetic polymers have been most widely used as primary, secondary and tertiary food packaging materials. Polypropylene, high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyvinylchloride are some of the examples of conventional polymers that are commonly used in food manufacturing industries. These polymer materials are non-degradable and their disposal causes adverse impact on the environment. Environmental considerations, coupled with the growing concerns over the long-term effects of synthetic polymers in direct contact with food materials on human health, have necessitated the search for better alternatives. In this context, development of biopolymers and biodegradable polymers to meet the food packaging needs is being widely explored by the researchers and industries [1,2].\nBiopolymers as successful candidates in food packaging industries are advantageous over their synthetic counterparts on account of their low environmental impact, sustainability and cost effectiveness. They can be easily blended with other polymers and reinforced with bio-\nwari).\nbasedmaterials, such as, naturalfibers, to impart desirable thermal, mechanical and barrier properties to be on par with the synthetic food packaging materials. Many of the biopolymers also possess desirable biodegradability and antimicrobial activity. Cellulose, starch, collagen, alginate, gluten, gelatin and carrageenan are some of the examples of biodegradable polymers [3–5]. Among the various biopolymerswith inherent biodegradability and microbial resistance, chitosan (CS) has been known to be a versatile choice because of its film forming ability, non-toxicity andwide availability [6–9]. It has been extensively studied, not only for food packaging, but also for water purification, drug delivery, cosmetics, agricultural, bio-sensors and bone tissue engineering applications [10–19].\nCS films suffer from certain drawbacks, such as, poor mechanical strength andpoormoisture barrier, [20]which limit its use as a foodpackaging film. This is generally overcome by, i) blendingwith other synthetic or bio-polymers and ii) reinforcing with organic or inorganic agents. In this regard, materials, which are inherently hydrophilic, biocompatible and antimicrobial, offer attractive potential to be combined with CS and developed into food packaging films. Zivanovic et al. [21] have fabricated chitosan/polyethylene oxide films that possessed good mechanical and antimicrobial properties. Yang et al. [22] reported that blending of CS with cellulose films increased the tensile strength, elongation at break and provide antibacterial properties over those of plain CS. Blending of CS with environmentally benign materials, such as, corn starch, propolis,\npolyvinyl alcohol, lignin, polycaprolactone, gelatin, pectin, methylcellulose, collagen, agar and green tea extracts has been reported to not only improve themechanical strength, barrier properties and biodegradability, but also enhance its suitability for food packaging [23–28].\nThe mechanical, barrier and antimicrobial properties of plain CS and CS-based blends can be fine tuned to suit food packaging needs by the addition of nano fillers such as nano clay [29], nano cellulose [30], metals and metal oxide nano particles [31]. In addition, CS based bionanocomposites have numerous applications in a field of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, wound dressing and agricultural technologies [32–36]. Sudheesh Kumar et al. [37] have fabricated flexible CS hydrogel/nano zinc oxide composite bandages. The bionanocomposite bandages exhibited blood clotting ability along with antibacterial activity and cytocompatibility and could be used for burns and diabetic wound infections. Tripathi et al. [38] have fabricated CS-silver oxide nano compositefilm via solution castingmethod. Thefilmpossessed excellent antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ghelejlu et al. [39] have reported the fabrication of CS/MMT bionanocomposites incorporated with S. marinum extract. The film showed enhanced physico-mechanical, barrier and higher antioxidant properties. Anwar [40] showed that the incorporation of manganese oxide nano particles into chitosan caused a significant enhancement in the adsorption ability, which was useful for the removal of lead ions. Luna-Hernandez and coworkers reported the synthesis of silver nano particles embedded-CS matrix with antimicrobial and biocompatible properties that can be potentially used in health care and wound dressing applications [41]. In general, incorporation of metal oxide nano particles such as TiO2 [42], ZnO [20] andMgO [43] into food packagingfilms has been reported to have a significant influence on the antimicrobial, mechanical and barrier properties of polymericmatrices. ZnO nano particles (nano ZnO) have been shown to impart medium to high thermal stability, excellent barrier ability to CS-based bionanocomposite films [44–47]. Mujeeb Rahman et al. [48] reported the preparation of antimicrobial CS-ZnO bionanocomposite pouches that could extend the shelf life of rawmeat. Abdul Razak et al. [49] demonstrated that the incorporation of nano ZnO in to CS increased the antimicrobial property and decreased thewater vapour transmission rate, compared to plain CS films. Ummartyotin and Pechyen [50] found that ZnO-dispersed chitosanmatrix showed excellent resistance to E. coli and S. aureus. Saral Sarojini et al. [51] have reported nano ZnO incorporated CS - mahua oil based polyurethane composite films for food packaging applications.\nStudies have shown that nano particle-reinforced CS blends are promising candidates as food packing films [20,42,52]. The right choices of the blending polymer and the reinforcement can lead to CS based films that are potential alternatives to the non-biodegradable packaging materials. In this context, the present work aimed to explore the active food packaging ability of nano ZnO-reinforced-CS-cellulose acetate phthalatefilms. Cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) is a crystalline, hydrophilic and inherently biodegradable polymer that haswidespread use in pharmaceuticals as a coating on tablets [53–55]. Studies on the influence of CAP on the general and food packaging characteristics of CSbased films are few and far between. Hence, in the present study, CAP was chosen to be blended with CS. Chitosan-cellulose acetate phthalate (CS-CAP) films with and without nano ZnO reinforcement were fabricated by solvent casting and analyzed for their thermal, mechanical, barrier, biodegradation and antimicrobial characteristics. The films were also investigated for their ability to enhance the shelf life of fresh black grape fruits."

      "text" : "2.1. ATR-IR of CS, CSC and CCZ2 films\nATR-IR of the CS film (Fig. 1) showed peaks and bands characteristic of CS that have been reported by researchers [24,56]. It showed a broad\nband at 3223 cm−1 due to O\\\\H stretching and N\\\\H stretching vibrations and a shallow band at 2923 cm−1 due to CH2 stretching. The bands at 1630 and 1577 cm−1 were due to C_O stretching (amide I band) and N\\\\H bending (amide II band), respectively. The stretching vibrations of C\\\\N and C\\\\O\\\\C linkages were observed at 1366 and 1017 cm−1, respectively [57]. The ATR-IR spectrum of CSC film (Fig. 1) showed prominent bands/peaks at 3290, 2919, 1721 and 1035 cm−1. Compared to the CS film, considerable shift in the position of band from 3223 to 3290 cm−1 (lower to higher) was noticed for CSC. This may have been due to inter molecular hydrogen bonding between the components of the blended films. Gaurav et al. [58] have reported the occurrence of the characteristic carbonyl peak at 1724 cm−1 for pure CAP. In the present study, the carbonyl peak of CAP has been shifted to 1721 cm−1, probably due to the inter-molecular hydrogen bond formation between carbonyl groups of CAP andOH groups in CS [59]. Some of the peaks due to the functional groups of CS and CAP have overlapped with each other in CSC.\nIncorporation of nano ZnO in the blended polymer matrix has resulted in some changes in the spectral peaks and bands, as evidenced from the ATR-IR spectrum of CCZ2 (Fig. 1). Addition of nano ZnO particles brought about slight changes in the position of bands towards higher or lower wave numbers. The observed shifts from 3290 (NH2 & OH groups) to 3325 cm−1, from 1721 (C_O group) to 1711 cm−1, 1552 to 1550 cm−1, from 1379 (C\\\\N group) to 1383 cm−1 and from 1020 (O\\\\C\\\\O group) to 1022 cm−1 in CCZ2, compared to CSC, were indicative of possible intermolecular hydrogen bonding and coordinate type interactions between CS-CAP matrix and ZnO reinforcement. Similar observations were reported by Mujeeb Rahman et al. [48], Perelshtein et al. [60], Pandiselvi and Thambidurai [61] and Revathi and Thambidurai [62]. A broad peak observed in the region between 600 and 400 cm−1 in CCZ2 films was due to the presence of some O\\\\Zn\\\\O vibrations [63], as also suggested by Li et al. [46].\n2.2. Mechanical properties of CS, CSC and CCZ films\nA typical food packagingmaterial should have high dimensional stability to be considered for practical applications. Themechanical properties of the films often reveal their suitability as potential packaging materials. All the films prepared in the present study were flexible and the chief reason for that could be the addition of glycerol as theplasticizer during film fabrication [64]. The tensile strength and elongation at break of the fabricated films are tabulated in Table 1 and thickness of the fabricated films are tabulated in Table S2 (Supplementary\ninformation). The CS filmhad the lowest tensile strength 8.29MPa compared to the other prepared films, due to its hydrophilic nature. A slight increase in the tensile strength of CSC film to 8.90 MPa could have been due to the inter-molecular hydrogen bonding between CS and CAP that was explained in ATR-IR analysis.\nAddition of nano ZnO to the CS-CAP blend increased the tensile strength of the films indicating the better interaction between CS, CAP and nano ZnO. A similar increase has been reported in the numerous composite films fabricated using nano clays, nano fibers and other nano filler reinforcements [65–67]. The tensile strength of the CCZ2 with 5% (w/w) ZnO was about 60% more than that of CCZ1. However, further loading of 7.5% (w/w) ZnO decreased the tensile strength and also made the film brittle. This could have been due to the agglomeration of excess of ZnO on the polymer blend matrix at this loading. Hence, a loading of 5% (w/w) of ZnO could be considered as optimum in bringing about desirable modifications in the mechanical properties of the film through uniform dispersion of nano ZnO on the matrix. At this loading of ZnO,maximumextent of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between nano ZnO and CS-CAP matrix could have occurred, as suggested from the observations of ATR-IR analysis. Similar observations have also been reported by Sanuja et al. [43]. In Fig. 2, stiffness of the CS, CSC and CCZ films were found to be 6.38, 7.6, 9.2, 21.6 and 15.3 N/mm for CS, CSC, CCZ1, CCZ2 and CCZ3 films, respectively. It could be noticed that CCZ2 film with a proposed optimum ZnO content possessed the most suitable stiffness to be used as packaging material.\nAs can be expected, the elongation at break of all three CCZ filmswas comparatively lower than the CS-CAP blended film without reinforcement, as shown in Table 1. Therewas a progressive decrease in the elongation at break with an increase in ZnO loading in the polymericmatrix. This suggested that ZnO offered interfacial bonding interactions, in addition to being reinforcement in the polymer matrix [68].\n2.3. Optical properties and visual appearance of prepared CS, CSC and CCZ films\nPacked foods can be easily deteriorated, discolored and undergo nutrients loss on exposure to UV and visible radiations and hence, transparency and UV-screening ability of packaging films are important in controlling such loss. In general, most of the synthetic polymeric food packaging films such as, low density polyethylene and polypropylene have low ability to screen UV radiation [69]. The UV–visible absorption spectra of CS, CSC and CCZ films in thewavelength range at 200–800 nm are presented in Fig. 3A. The CS and CSC films showed lower absorption at 280 nm in the UV region. All the CCZ films showed increased absorption at 280 nm in the UV region than the CS and CSC films [51]. The fabricated films blended with nano ZnO showed some additional absorption peaks around 360–380 nmdue to ZnO,whose peak intensity increased with an increase in the nano ZnO loading [70]. Shankar et al. [71] also reported similar results of absorption peaks of nano ZnO in gelatin/ZnO loaded nanocomposite. It can be inferred that the nano ZnO in the CSCfilms acted as a UV blocker and prevented the penetration of UV rays through the fabricated films [72]. Yu et al. [73] also reported that the incorporation of ZnO into GPS-CMC nanocomposites have protected the film against UV light. These results suggested that CCZ films can potentially act as UV shielding materials and hence, prevent the discoloration and deterioration of packed foods by UV absorption.\nOpacity of the fabricatedfilmswas calculated from the absorbance of the films at 600 nm, by using Eq. (1) (supplementary information). The comparative plot is shown in Fig. 3B. The opacity values of the CS and CSC films were found to be 2.1 ± 0.51 and 2.5 ± 0.31, respectively, which indicated them to be less opaque (more transparent). As can be seen from Fig. 3B, the opacity of the CCZfilms, increasedwith increasing nano ZnO content in them. The opacity values of CCZ1, CCZ2 and CCZ3 filmswere found to be 4.42± 0.41, 5.02± 0.22 and 6.17± 0.11 respectively, which indicated that nano ZnO dispersed in them was responsible for the decrease in the transparency [74,75]. Visual analysis of the CCZ films showed them to be translucent and not completely opaque. A similar effect of reinforcing agents such as nanoclay and ZnO on the K-carrageenan, sago starch and carboxymethyl cellulose-chitosan has been reported by Nafchi et al. [76], Priyadarshi et al. [2], Noshirvani et al. [77].\n2.4. Water vapour transmission rate of the CS, CSC and CCZ films\nWater vapour transmission rate of films is an important factor that influences the shelf life of packed food. Packed foods can be easily deteriorated due to moisture absorption from the environment and hence the packaging film should offer significantly high barrier to moisture. WVTR for the fabricated films is shown in Table 1.\nThe CS film showed highest WVTR value of 438 ± 2.2 g/m2/d in comparison to other films, due to its inherent hydrophilicity [78]. There was a slight decrease in the water vapour transmission rate of CSC film to 390 ± 1.8 g/m2/d due to the hydrogen bonding formation between NH2 group of CS with OH group of CAP and the resultant increase in hydrophobicity [79]. Addition of nano ZnO particles to the CS-CAPmatrix imparted significant hydrophobicity to the films. Similar observation was also shown by Noshirvani et al. [77]. This may be explained as due to the dispersion of nano ZnO in the polymer matrix [80]. The CCZ3 film with 5% (w/w) nano ZnO exhibited a 68% enhancement in its barrier ability for water, over the CSC film. Studies have\nsion rate of CS, CSC and CCZ films. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation and\nshown polymeric films, such as polyamide, polystyrene and biodegradable polylactic acid and edible potato peel-based films to possessWVTR of 348, 158, 556 and 163 g/m2/d, respectively [81–83]. It is hence evident that the CCZ films fabricated in this study, compared very well with these films, with respect to their water vapour transmission rate.\n2.5. Oxygen transmission rate of the CS, CSC and CCZ films\nAbility of polymeric packaging films to preserve fresh food, especially vegetables and fruits, is highly influenced by the oxygen barrier\nFig. 4.Water contact angle of (A) CS (B) CS\nproperty of the films. The oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of the fabricated films is shown in Table 1. As is evident, the nano composite films showed excellent oxygen barrier capabilities, compared to CS and CSC films [84,85]. OTR values of the CCZ films gradually decreased with an increase on the nano ZnO content in the polymer matrix. The extent of porosity of the films decreased with an increase in the nano ZnO distribution in the composite. This might have chiefly contributed to the increased resistance rendered by the films to oxygen gas [86,87]. Compared to the widely used polymeric films, LDPE, polystyrene and HDPE, whose OTR are 8500, 5500 and 3100 cm3/m2/d,\nC, (C) CCZ1, (D) CCZ2, (E) CCZ3 films.\nrespectively, all the CCZ films were notably more resistant to oxygen transmission [81].\n2.6. Water contact angle of CS, CSC and CCZ films\nWater contact angle measurements provide information on the hydrophilicity of the films [88]. Water contact angles for CS, CSC, CCZ1, CCZ2 and CCZ3 are shown in Fig. 4(A)–(E). The surface wettability and contact angle measurements are related to each other, in that, low surface wettability leads to high contact angle and vice versa [57]. Among the prepared films, the CS film showed the lowest contact angle of 45° indicating a high surface wettability due to its hydrophilic nature. Similar observation was also reported by Nafchi et al. [76]. The CSC film showed a slight increase in the contact angle, 57° due to the presence of CAP which was less hydrophilic than CS. All CCZ composite films showed higher contact angles of 78, 81 and 90°, compared to CS and CSC films. The hydrophobicity of the prepared films increased with an increase in nano ZnO content in them [89,90]. However, the films were not completely hydrophobic, as suggested by the contact angles of b100°. This is important, since food packaging films for fresh vegetables and fruits need to have a minimum wettability and water permeability to allow the moisture from the packed food to diffuse out of the film [91]."

      "text" : "It could be observed that, CCZ3 showed improved barrier and optical properties, but possessed low tensile and stiffness properties, which are important parameters to consider in food packaging. So, CCZ2 film with optimalmechanical, stiffness and barrier properties could be considered as themost suitable film to be explored for food packaging applications. Hence, the antimicrobial activity of CCZ2was tested against the twomicroorganisms, namely, S. aureus and E. coli [1,77,78]. Fig. 5 shows the antimicrobial activity of the CS, CSC and CCZ2 films. Magnitudes of zone of inhibition in diameter (mm) of the fabricated films in comparison with standard are tabulated in Table 2. All the fabricated films showed antimicrobial activity against the test microorganisms (Fig. 5. The antimicrobial activity of the CS film could have been due the presence of amino groups in CS, which can interact with the negatively charged cell walls of microorganisms and lead to the breakage of proteinaceous\nsubstance (Priyadarshi and Negi [1]). As can be seen from Table 2, the zone of inhibition of bacterial resistances has been significantly enhanced by the incorporation of nano ZnO in CCZ2 film compared to pure CS. Such an increase has also been observed in CS loaded with plant extracts and essential oils [88,92]. It was observed that the zones of inhibition of CCZ2 film were closer to that of the standard. Such high microbial resistance is a significant characteristic in determining the application of the film in food packaging [93,94].\n2.8. Evaluation of food packaging ability of the films\nThe ability of CCZ2 to protect food and enhance the shelf life of food was evaluated by using it as a protective film for black grapes. The physical changes as well as the bacterial growth in the grape fruit were analyzed and compared to the results obtained with grapes i) left open to air and ii) wrapped in commercial polyethylene, over nine days, at ambient temperature. The number of bacterial colonies formed was calculated by spread plate method.\nThe visual appearance of grapes over 9 days of observation has been shown in Fig. 6. Black grapes kept in an open plate (Fig. 6(A)–(D)) as well as in commercial polyethylene cover (Fig. 6(E)–(H)), started rotting by the third day and were completely deteriorated by the 9th day of observation. However, those wrapped in the CCZ2 nano composite films, depicted in (Fig. 6(I)–(L)), were observed to be fresh even after six days, with no noticeable deterioration. Slight changes began to take place by the 7th day and the grapes became soggy and juicy at the end of 9 days.\nThe qualitative analyses of the microbial population in the grapes after 9 days of storage was carried out by assessing the bacteria formed on them through spread plate method and were shown in Fig. 7. The microbial growth was represented in terms of colony forming unit (CFU/ml). It was observed that only harmless food borne bacteria was formed in grapes wrapped in CCZ2 film, after 9th day of packaging and no fungal growth was observed. A comparison of CFU/ml at different serial dilution (10−3, 10−4, 10−6, 10−7) is shown in Table 3. It was evident that the colony forming units on grapes wrapped in CCZ2\nwere lower in all dilutions, compared to those on grapes kept open and stored in polyethylene cover. Similar results have been observed in the extension of shelf life of breads [77,93] and grapes [95] using Ag/ZnO impregnated CS matrix. Thus, the CCZ2 film could be proposed to have extended the shelf life of the grapes under ambient conditions, evidently because of its optimal oxygen andmoisture barrier ability and excellent microbial resistance. Hence, the CCZ2 film fabricated in the present study could be proved to be a successful food packaging film,\nin (A) open plate, (B) polyethylene cover and (C) CCZ2 films grapes.\nTable 3 Enumeration of microorganisms by colony counting method for grapes in: (A) - open plate, (B) - polyethylene cover and (C) - CCZ2 film.\nS. no Dilution Colony forming unit CFU/ml (A) open plate grapes Colony forming unit CFU/ml (B) polyethylene cover grapes Colony forming unit for CFU/ml (C) CCZ2 film grapes\n1. 10−3 290 260 200 2. 10−4 200 170 156 3. 10−6 112 103 89 4. 10−7 59 61 48\nFig. 8.

All the prepared films showed weight loss and changes in structural integrity due to the degradation of the biologically oxidisable contents in them [96,97]. The CS film was completely biodegraded within 4 weeks and the CSC films were degraded by about 70% within 30 days. The CCZ films were biodegraded only to about 30–50% in 28 days. In general, hydrophilic polymeric films are easily biodegraded. Thus, CS film with high water absorption and surface wettability was degraded to 100% in 4 weeks of soil burial. Based on the WVTR and water contact angles, CCZ films could be predicted to undergo gradual biodegradation. The changes in surface morphology of CCZ film before and after soil burial (Fig. 9(A) & (B)) suggested that extensive structural disruptions occurred in the film after 28 days. However, the presence of stronger binding forces in CCZ, compared to CS and CSC, held the films for a prolonged duration. The CCZ films were totally disbanded and degraded at the end of 5 months [98]."

The results of ATR-IR spectrum and DSC analyses revealed the presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding and coordinate-type interactions between CS-CAP and ZnO. The SEM micrographs of CCZ2 film showed uniform dispersion of nano ZnO on to CS-CAPmatrix. Addition of nano ZnO to CS-CAP blended matrix influenced the mechanical properties of the film and the CCZ2 film came to possess optimal stiffness and tensile strength to be explored as a structurally stable food packaging film. The water vapour transmission rate and oxygen transmission rate were significantly lower for CCZ films, compared to those of commercial polymeric films. The translucent CCZ2 film exhibited excellent UV shielding ability, antimicrobial properties and biodegradabilitye. Real time assessment of the protection offered by CCZ2 through wrapping black grapes indicated the film to have superior barrier to atmospheric agents, with minimal invasion of food-spoiling bacteria and fungi on the fruit, through the film. Thus, the CCZ2 could be recommended as a packaging film for fresh vegetables and fruits.

The present study deals with the fabrication and characterisation of chitosan (CS) cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) films incorporated with ZnO nanoparticles (nano ZnO). CS-CAP films with varying ratios of nano ZnO reinforcement were prepared by solvent casting method. The thermal stability and barrier properties of the fabricated films increased with increasing amount of nano ZnO in the range of 2–7.5% (w/w). CS-CAP film loadedwith 5% (w/w) nano ZnO showed themost optimal tensile strength and stiffness to be utilized as a food packagingmaterial.Water contact anglemeasurements showed the prepared nano compositefilms to have low surfacewettability and high contact angle value up to 90°. Biodegradability of the nano compositefilms ranged from30 to 50% in 28 days. The CS-CAPfilm loadedwith 5% (w/w) nano ZnO had extended the shelf life of black grape fruits up to 9 days. The demonstrated barrier and food protection characteristics of the CS-CAP-ZnO films attested its suitability as a primary food packaging material that can be used to increase the shelf life of black grape fruits. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
