i a a T a a o p\nNanomedicine involves the use of nanomaterials with novel or nhanced properties, such as size-dependent tunable electronic, ptical, magnetic, and chemical behavior, for medical applicaions. This field has made great progress in its contributions to iomedical science in the last decades [1–6]. Through innovaive design and fabrication of nanostructures, nanomedicine can roduce therapeutic agents that target specific sites and cure iseases safely and effectively. Nanomedicine can provide effecive photosensitizers for photothermal and photodynamic therapy y producing high photo-thermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) 7–9] and photo-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generaion [10–12], respectively. Nanostructures can also be developed or bio-imaging technologies in the form of contrast enhancement anoagents and nanoprobes. For example, nanostructures with road absorption and narrow emission spectra are valuable for uorescence imaging [13–17], and magnetic nanomaterials can be sed as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [18], hile nanomaterials with high PTCE can be employed for phoothermal imaging and photoacoustic imaging [19–22]. Numerous rganic and inorganic nanomaterials have been extensively investiated for nanomedicine, including liposomes, dendrimers, polymer anoparticles (NPs) and micelles, graphene, carbon nanotubes, etal NPs and quantum dots (QDs). Each kind of nanomaterial as its own merits and limitations. Organic nanomaterials proide broad design flexibility for combining multiple functionalities, ut this flexibility is combined with drawbacks including intrinsic esign complexity, high manufacturing cost, and structural instaility. Inorganic nanomaterials are often intrinsically robust with elatively low manufacturing cost, but their limited design flexiility and functionality present challenges that remain to be fully vercome.\nCytotoxicity and clearance are critical issues for clinical transation of nanomaterials that must be addressed by researchers eveloping new materials. Many inorganic nanomaterials, and ven organic nanostructures, exhibit poor bio-compatibility, and hould be coated with biocompatible materials for use in biomedcal applications [23]. In addition, they may not degrade in vivo nd/or be eliminated by renal excretion. Consequently, they may ccumulate in particular organs and cause unwanted side effects. herefore, biocompatible nanomaterials with multiple functionlities are in great demand. Problems associated with long-term ccumulation-induced toxicity and incomplete excretion can be vercome by employing silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) or black phoshorus nanoparticles (BPNPs), which possess distinct advantages\nof both good biodegradability and bio-compatibility. Elemental silicon, the second most abundant element in the earth’s crust, is biodegradable, ecologically safe, and known to be metabolized. Silicon also plays a key role in the growth and maintenance of bones. Silicon degrades in vivo to orthosilicic acid, which is the bioavailable form of silicon in the human body and which can be excreted in urine [24,25]. Phosphorus is an essential element accounting for approximately 1% of the total mass of the human body, and its final degradation products are harmless, making BP-based nanomaterial suitable for biomedical applications [8,9,26]. These two elemental semiconductor nanostructures (SiNPs and BPNPs) thus have common features of useful optical, electronic, and chemical properties, biocompatibility, and degradability that lead us to consider them together in this review.\nIn contrast with many other inorganic nanomaterials, SiNPs and BPNPs have excellent biocompatibility as well as unique physicochemical properties especially suitable for biomedical applications [27–29]. Nanosilicon quantum dots (SiQDs) exhibit bright and size tunable photoluminescence that can be extended to the NIR regime, with excellent photostability for bioimaging applications [17]. In addition, various surface modification strategies enable production of nano-silicon with multiple functions. Silicon nanostructures and silicon-containing nano-formulations, surface-modified with antibodies or aptamers and containing drugs, photosensitizers and genes, can be used for targeted therapy [30]. In combination with contrast agents and fluorophores, SiNPs also provide a powerful tool for multimodal imaging and diagnosis. BP has a tunable direct band gap, and can interact with light from the UV to NIR range [31]. This endows BP with large extinction coefficient, high PTCE and photo-redox capabilities, making BP a potential photosensitizing material for phototherapy [10]. Furthermore, a puckered layer structure held together by van der Waals forces provides BP with an ultra large specific surface area that can be used to load various drugs, bioactive molecules, fluorescent molecules, or metal atoms for applications including targeted drug delivery, cell imaging, tumor therapy, and biomolecular detection [32]. Most importantly, the negligible cytotoxicity and excellent biodegradability make SiNPs and BPNPs particularly suitable candidates for biomedical applications, compared with most other nanomaterials [33,34].\nIn recent years, great breakthroughs have been achieved in research on SiNPs and BPNPs for a broad range of applications in energy, life sciences, and other fields. In this review, we focus on SiNPs and BPNPs and their related biomedical applications. First,\nToday\nw u a w i a F t a a t\nF\nF\nm s c a e W e t i p l w c i B ( i l s a [ a s c o i a h a B w c I d i B g m B a a u a d b fi O f\nM. Qiu et al. / Nano\ne discuss the fabrication of SiNPs and BPNPs, including methods sed to control their size, shape, thickness and surface functionlization. Secondly, we discuss the multifunctionality achievable ith these materials by combining optical, electronic, photochemcal, magnetic, and thermal properties. Then, we discuss the toxicity nd elimination of SiNPs and BPNPs both in vitro and in vivo. urthermore, biomedical applications for disease diagnosis and herapy, including stimuli-responsive drug delivery, phototherapy, nd bioimaging are discussed. Finally, we consider the challenges nd future prospects that are important for their potential clinical ranslation.\nabrication and surface functionalization\nabrication\nThe production of few-layer BP has been demonstrated in any research contributions over the past three years. Syntheis approaches can be categorized into top-down (e.g. mechanical leavage and liquid phase exfoliation) and bottom-up (e.g. CVD nd wet-chemistry) methods [35]. Mechanical exfoliation of BP, xploiting its weak interlayer interaction involving only van der aals forces, was demonstrated in 2014 [36,37]. The mechanical xfoliation method can be combined with a subsequent plasma hinning process which can produce monolayer or few-layer BP n a controllable manner [38]. However, from the point of view of ractical applications, this approach suffers shortcomings such as ow yield and lack of morphology controllability. These problems ere resolved by the liquid phase exfoliation method, which is a omparatively simpler and less expensive process that can readly be scaled up to meet the needs of bio-applications of few-layer P. Polar aprotic organic solvents, such as n-methyl pyrrolidone NMP), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl formamide (DMF), sopropyl alcohol (IPA), and ethanol have used to prepare fewayer BP [39–41]. In addition, many other methods, e.g. ionic liquid olvents to obtain BP at high concentration [42], fast and manageble electrochemical ion intercalation for high efficiency exfoliation 43,44], industrially scalable high shear exfoliation, and microwave ssisted exfoliation have been investigated. The use of organic olvents during BP preparation is not conducive to clinical appliation. To avoid the presence of any residual organic solvents n the BPNP surface, attempts have been made to exfoliate BP n water. However, during the exfoliation process, BP was easily ggregated and rapidly degraded, because of its low stability and igh activity in aqueous solution. To solve this problem, Kang et al. ttempted surfactant-assisted exfoliation and postprocessing of P in deoxygenated water. The resulting phosphorene dispersions ere stable, highly concentrated and comparable to micromehanically exfoliated phosphorene in structure and chemistry [45]. n addition to the top-down method, a bottom-up method was emonstrated recently. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which s capable of controlling the doping content and the thickness of P, was used to generate an ultra-large few-layer BP sheet with ood crystallinity [46,47]. Furthermore, a wet-chemical solvotheral reaction method has also been employed to prepare few-layer P from bulk red phosphorous precursors [48]. Different strategies nd methods of preparation produce distinct nano-morphologies ppropriate for various biomedical applications. For example, liqid phase exfoliation can usually produce BP quantum dots (BPQDs) nd BP nanosheets (BPNSs) with relatively smaller size in both iameter and thickness. These nanostructures are suitable for\nioimaging and drug delivery, due to the influence of quantum connement effects at small sizes, and the role of size in the EPR effect. n the other hand, CVD-derived BP materials are more appropriate\nor application in FET-based biosensing, due to the control of dop-\n25 (2019) 135–155 137\ning level and thickness achievable by CVD, to provide better carrier mobility and photoelectronic performance.\nSince the first discovery of the unique optical properties of SiNPs [49], various preparation strategies have been proposed to fabricate different types of SiNPs [50]. Bottom–up methods involve condensation reactions of silicon compounds, leading to homogeneous nucleation of nanosilicon in the solid, liquid, or vapor phase. Various physical and chemical means can be used to control nanocrystal nucleation and promote the growth of NPs with uniform morphology. Some of the most effective bottom-up methods of producing SiNPs include solution-phase reduction of chlorosilanes [51], laser pyrolysis of silane [52], low-pressure plasma decomposition of silane [53], and thermal processing of hydrogen silesquioxane [54]. Fabrication of SiNPs by top–down methods normally involves electrochemical etching of silicon wafers in hydrofluoric acid to obtain porous silicon films followed by mechanical grinding or sonication to break the nanoporous film into NPs [29,55–57]. A. H. Kashyout et al. fabricated porous silicon (PSi) by an alkali etching process, in 2 wt% KOH and 15 vol% n-propanol at 80 ◦C for 5 h [58]. The porous nanosilicon particle size was 15 nm, as calculated from XRD data. The degradation rate of PSi with high porosity was accelerated in acid solution, demonstrating the controllable biodegradability and bioresorbability of PSi. Yet another top-down method involves femtosecond laser ablation of bulk silicon to produce nanosilicon by the rapid heating and vaporization effect of pulsed laser radiation [59]. Use of femtosecond pulses allows control of processing conditions in generation of nanoclusters that, upon interaction with the surrounding environment and one another, form larger NPs. Specific nanoclusters can condense on a substrate in a low-pressure gaseous atmosphere or vacuum to form nanostructured films for biosensing. Pulsed laser ablation in a liquid produces nanoclusters that can form stable colloidal dispersions, as their surfaces are charged. Different preparation strategies produce SiNPs appropriate for different biological applications. For example, SiQDs fabricated by bottom-up methods with uniform size below 10 nm and bright visible photoluminescence have been the most effective for use in bioimaging. On the other hand, porous nanosilicon generated by top–down methods provides tailored pore sizes and volumes and large specific surface area that make it attractive for use in drug delivery.\nSurface functionalization\nThough bulk BP materials are relatively stable, FLBP degrades by chemical reaction in the presence of water, oxygen and light. Zhou et al. proposed an ambient FLBP degradation mechanism based upon electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics simulations [60], in which superoxide anions (O2−) generated on the FLBP surface under ambient light dissociate and react with phosphorus on the FLBP surface to produce two P O bonds. Then water molecules interact with the surface oxygen through hydrogen-bonding interactions to remove the phosphorus clusters and break the phosphorene layer. Therefore, surface modification is critical for improving BP stability. On the other hand, because there is no reactive organic functional unit on the BP surface, surface modification of BP for further applications has been challenging. PEGylation has been implemented to overcome this issue [9], but was found to be vulnerable to external interference including biomolecule adsorption and self-aggregation and degradation at high ionic strength. In 2016, Zhao et al. introduced sulfonic ester-ligated titanium onto BP by surface coordination to prepare BP@TiL4 and found that its stability in aqueous environments was markedly enhanced (Fig. 1A) [61]. Ryder et al. also introduced aryl diazonium covalently bonded to the BP surface, and found that it successfully suppressed the degradation process even for several weeks at ambient conditions (Fig. 1B) [62]. Shao et al. reported preparation of biodegradable BPQD/PLGA nanospheres by encapsu-\n138 M.

Furthermore, the biodegradation behavior of PQDs/PLGA nanospheres was accelerated after the PLGA shell was rst degraded. In addition to its protective effect, surface modifiation can also improve the biocompatibility and both electronic nd optical properties of BP, which could contribute to its potenial in biomedical applications. For example, TiL4-coated BP could scape macrophage uptake, thus reducing cytotoxicity and proinammation compared with bare BP [63]. BP modified with the Nile lue dye through diazonium chemistry exhibited NIR fluorescence, nabling NIR imaging-guided PTT [64]. Functionalization of BP with ryl diazonium further alters its electronic properties, via p-type oping which could improve mobility and on/off current ratio in eld-effect transistors [62].\nThe intrinsic biodegradability of SiNPs is generally advantaeous for the design of biocompatible formulations for in vivo pplications. However, bare SiNPs are relatively rapidly degraded o silicic acid in water, particularly under acidic conditions, and his degradation must be slowed for some applications. The reltively low stability of SiNPs under physiological conditions has indered some bio-applications. Therefore, fabrication of SiNPs hat have ability to withstand a physiological environment and\naintain their optical and electronic properties long enough to erve their intended purpose, but that still biodegrade and clear\nith sulfonic ester ligated titanium.

In some cases, organic passivation of SiNP surfaces has been so robust that the particles did not degrade over a period of months in vivo. This illustrates the need to achieve an optimal degree and type of passivation of the SiNP surface to control degradation [24]. SiNPs are most often surface passivated via a hydrosilylation reaction with an alkene or alkyne that creates a very stable silicon-carbon bond attaching an organic ligand to the SiNP surface [66]. Direct attachment of hydrophilic molecules to the Si surface to promote aqueous dispersibility has been demonstrated [67–69], but has provided limited success in achieving long-term chemical and colloidal stability. Wrapping or encapsulation with polymers improves the water dispersibility of SiNPs, and protects them from aggregation and oxidation [17]. Amphiphilic polymers can form very stable micelles that localize multiple SiQDs in the hydrophobic core region of micelle, which enables co-encapsulation with various hydrophobic cargos [70]. PEGylated micelles encapsulating SiNPs possess excellent stability as well as long circulation time in biological environments [25]. After being surface modified with peptides, aptamers, antibodies or proteins, SiQD formulations can be further endowed with specific targeting ability, which leads to enhanced cell uptake and accumulation in pathological tissue. In one study, myristic acid and SiQDs were co-encapsulated by DSPE-PEG-NH2 and Pluronic® F127 [30]. Then, CD44-targeting\nM.

The myristic acid in the core region of the nanoparticle as released from the micelle over an extended period of time. Furher, pluronic® block copolymers were used to encapsulate SiQDs o enhance their water dispersibility for bioimaging. The micelles ere formed by the interplay of the poly (oxypropylene) (PPO) secion of the F127COOH and the ethyl undecylenate layer around the iQDs [71]. Consequently, the hydrophilic carboxylate groups at he ends of the F127COOH poly (oxyethylene) (PEO) domain were xposed, providing good dispersibility in aqueous solution. Such olymeric micelles have better stability and lower critical micelle oncentration (CMC) values (1̃0−6 M), compared to micelles preared from traditional small molecule surfactants or detergents, uch as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or cetyltrimethly ammonium romide (CTAB). Normally, polymeric micelles can encapsulate ydrophobic NPs, providing broad biodistribution, extended sysemic circulation time, and reduced toxicity. Surface modification an also have significant impact on the electronic and optical proprties of SiNPs. Capping of SiNPs with nitrogen-containing ligands as reported to cause a blue shift of emission wavelength while ncreasing PL quantum yield to nearly 90% [72,73]. However, these ffects depend upon the nature of the initial SiQDs, as demonstrated n a comparison of PL from SiQDs prepared by different synthesis\nethods interacting with nitrogen-containing molecules [74,75]. n addition, the stability of PL from SiQDs has been a major barrier o commercial applications. Various organic molecules, including rignard reagents, alkenyl and alkyl functionalities, can provide ffective means of stabilizing the luminescence, as discussed in the eview by Dasog et al [76].\nundamental properties\nlectronic structure\nBP is a direct band gap semiconductor in which the band opology remains the same for all thicknesses, in contrast to the ndirect-to-direct band gap transition observed in transition metal ichalcogenides (TMDs). The band gap of bulk BP is 0.3 eV, and the and gap gradually increases to 2.0 eV as the thickness decreases o a single monolayer, due to the quantum confinement effect. or application in transistors, BP not only has a suitable band gap etween those of graphene and TMDs, and possesses a moderate n/off ratio (1041̃05), but also provides a relatively high carrier\nobility of around 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1. Accordingly, phosphorene\nas balanced performance that can be extensively utilized for otential photonic and optoelectronic applications, compared with ther 2D materials.\nted with permission of [30] ©2013 Ivyspring International Publisher.\nUnlike BP, bulk silicon is an indirect bandgap semiconductor, which means its valence band maximum and conduction band minimum have different momentum vectors, and any electronic transition requires participation of a phonon. This requirement drastically reduces the probability of radiative transitions (absorbance and emission of photons) in bulk silicon. However, for SiQDs the momentum selection rule is relaxed as the transitions are localized. At the same time, confinement of photogenerated excitons to a single defect-free and well-passivated nanocrystal reduces the probability of non-radiative recombination. As a result, these SiQDs can be made highly emissive. In addition, because of quantum confinement, the emission wavelength is size dependent. Thus, larger size SiQDs can emit in the near IR, near the bandgap of bulk silicon (1̃.1 eV or 1̃100 nm), which falls in the first window of maximum optical transparency in a biological medium, making them very suitable for optical bioimaging.\nOptical properties\nBecause of its layer-dependent electronic band gap, monolayer to few-layer BP covers a wide absorption spectrum and has a strong interaction with electromagnetic waves from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared range. The layer-dependent band gap tunability of BP is potentially suitable for many optoelectronic applications. BP also exhibits a layer-dependent photoluminescence spectrum due to quantum size effects, which can potentially be used for bioimaging. Castellanos Gomez et al. reported that the photoluminescence of few-layer black phosphorus (FLBP) flakes strongly depends on their thickness. Thinner flakes have an intense peak at 775 nm, while thicker flakes are featureless. Zhang et al. also observed highly layer- and direction-dependent photoluminescence in FLBP. The photoluminescence intensity increases exponentially as the layer thickness decreases from five to two layers.\nThe photoluminescence of SiQDs arises from recombination of quantum confined charge carriers, and becomes significant when the size of the NPs is comparable to or less than the exciton Bohr radius of silicon. In this regime, both the photoluminescence wavelength and lifetime are dependent on the NC diameter. Tuning the emission wavelength allows one to either use existing filter sets for organic dyes (for particles with emission at visible wavelengths) or to use more deeply penetrating infrared wavelengths. For example, researchers have prepared NIR SiQDs with narrowed emission spectra for deep tissue imaging by controlling NP size [24]. The relatively long photoluminescence lifetime (typically many microseconds) also allows time-gated imaging with a pulsed illumination source to eliminate effects of autofluorescence from biological materials. Silicon is easily oxidized, and in some cases, formation of an oxide layer can greatly impact the\n1 Today\no b t t e r f S f w\nP\ne p u a c i i a t P r S p a p t t r\nB\nf r H l u K i n t i h t t 2 2\np 1 B w f ( m e a t g c a\n40 M.

For example, Park et al. prepared SiNPs y electrochemical etching of single crystalline silicon, and found hat the luminescence was activated by silicon oxide grown on he hydrogen-terminated SiNPs, due to the quantum confinement ffects and defects at the Si-SiO2 interface [55]. In other cases, esearchers have taken great care to exclude oxygen during surace modification by hydrosilylation, producing nearly oxide-free iNPs [77,78]. Limiting surface oxidation is particularly important or achieving high PL quantum yield from SiQDs at red and NIR avelengths [79–81].\nhotothermal effect\nThe photothermal effect involves local conversion of optical nergy (e.g., from a laser) to thermal energy via photoexcitation of a hotosensitizer (PS) that absorbs strongly at the optical wavelength sed. Due to its operational simplicity, wide variety of materials vailable as photosensitizers, and high energy-conversion effiiency, photothermal conversion has garnered renewed research nterest in the past decade. It is now used in niche applications, ncluding steam generation, water desalination, and cancer therapy s well as in simpler devices such as solar water heaters. Compared o other PSs for PTT, such as graphene and AuNPs, BP has a very high TCE, due to its large extinction coefficient and strong nonradiative elaxation derived from phonon interactions in BP crystals. In 2015, un et al. first reported that BP exhibits excellent NIR photothermal erformance with a large extinction coefficient of 14.8 L g−1 cm−1 t 808 nm, a photothermal conversion efficiency of 28.4%, and good hotostability [9]. Many essential bio-applications including phoothermal and photoacoustic imaging as well as photo thermal herapy are based on the remarkable optical absorbance and nonadiative properties of BP.\niocompatibility and bioavailability\nBiocompatibility is widely viewed as the first consideration or biomedical nanomaterials. Any new material must undergo igorous biological toxicology tests prior to clinical application. owever, systematic research on the toxicity of BP is currently quite imited. Only a few studies have examined the cytotoxicity of BP, sing a methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay or a Cell Counting it-8 (CCK-8) assay. For instance, H. Zhang et al. reported that after ncubation of BPQDs with HSC, C6, 293 T, and MCF7 cells for 48 h, o obvious cytotoxicity was observed for BPQDs concentrations up o 200 ppm [9]. H. U. Lee et al. found that the BP nanodots exhibted low cytotoxicity against COS-7, HeLa, and CHO-K1 cells at a igh concentration of 1.0 mg/mL [13]. M. Qiu et al. performed cytooxicity evaluations at various concentrations of BPNSs, showing hat little or no cytotoxic effects could be observed for MDA-MB31, A549, HeLa, and B16 cells, even at a high concentration of 00 g/mL of BPNSs [82].\nOn the contrary, Mo et al. demonstrated that BPNSs and BPQDs roduced slight cytotoxic effects on H1299, L0-2, 293 T, dTHP-\ncells, and macrophages in peripheral blood. When BPNSs and PQDs were coated with a protein corona, the cytotoxic effect as significantly reduced [83]. In another study, BPNSs were also\nound to reduce A549 cell viability to 48% (WST-8 assay) and 34% MTT assay) at a concentration of 50 g/mL, with generally inter-\nediate toxicity between graphene oxides and TMDs [34]. Zhang t al. evaluated the cytotoxicity of BP by a label-free real-time cell nalysis technique, which provided concentration, size, and cell ype-dependent cytotoxicity (Fig. 3) [84]. The larger BP exhibited reater toxicity, and the smallest BP showed moderate toxicity. The ytotoxicity of BP against 293 T, NIH 3T3, and HCoEpiC cell lines lso varied considerably. The possible mechanisms for cytotoxicity\n25 (2019) 135–155\nwere generation of ROS and disruption of cell membrane integrity. Given the contradictory results in the literature, both the degree and mechanisms of inherent cytotoxicity of BP remain uncertain.\nGiven that current understanding of the biological effects of BP is extremely limited, the actual biological effect of BP in vivo is even more difficult to identify. The in vivo toxicity of BP was examined in very few studies. Li et al. reported good histocompatibility of BP in vivo. Their results showed that intravenous injection of 100 g BP per mouse caused no apparent side effects or histological changes [19]. Qu et al. investigated biological effects of BP with or without titanium sulfonate ligand (TiL4) modification in vitro and in vivo [63]. They found that the bare BP caused an obvious decrease of ATP level in J774 A.1 cells. In addition, the bare BP triggered a series of inflammatory reactions characterized by significant elevation of inflammatory cytokines in mice. In contrast, BP modified with TiL4 (TiL4@BP) could surprisingly escape phagocytosis by macrophages, which reduced cytotoxicity and generation of proinflammatory cytokines in vivo. These findings provide a new effective method to improve the biocompatibility of BP by surface modification.\nRapid biodegradation is another important advantage of BP for usage in vivo. Compared with conventional nanomaterials such as carbon nanomaterials and metal nanostructures, BP-based nanomaterials have advantages in biomedical applications, because of their degradability and inherent biocompatibility, as P is an essential element of the human body, accounting for about 1% of total body mass [26]. Unlike graphene, the elemental atoms of BP are connected by weak forces and can react with water and oxygen, and then finally be degraded to various nontoxic phosphates and phosphonates. The biodegradation process of BP is influenced by its size, surface modification and exposure to NIR irradiation. In Shao’s research [8], BP/PLGA composites showed a much slower degradation rate compared to a BP nanosheet because of the protection provided by PLGA. Nonetheless, nearly 80% of the BP/PLGA degraded within 8 weeks in vitro. Systematic and long-term biosafety evaluations of BP should still be conducted to establish a solid foundation for safe employment of BP-based nanosystems in biomedical applications.\nSiQDs can be modified with FDA-approved components for biomedical applications [71]. Silicon is an essential element and widely distributed in living organisms in the form of orthosilicate ions (SiO44−). Furthermore, in biological media, silicon nanostructures eventually degrade into orthosilicic acid Si(OH)4, which is naturally excreted through urine. Extensive studies on the cytotoxicity of silicon nanostructures have demonstrated their low toxicity. Kabashin’s group confirmed the negligible toxicity of laser ablation-synthesized SiNPs both in vitro and in vivo [85]. Intravenous administration of SiNPs did not cause any changes in blood chemistry or other key biochemical parameters. Furthermore, they systematically investigated the biodistribution and elimination of SiNPs by quantifying silicon concentration in feces, urine, spleen, lungs, brain, liver, heart and kidneys. SiNPs were opsonized (coated with opsonins) after intravenous injection, which facilitated their clearance from the blood into the reticuloendothelial system, notably the liver and spleen. By 3 to 5 days after injection, SiNPs were degraded and then excreted via renal filtration.\nOthers have reported that the toxicity of SiNPs depends on their size. Zuilhof et al. found that smaller silicon NPs give rise to toxicity, due in part to increased surface area [86]. The cytotoxicity of silicon also depends on the functional groups coated on SiNPs, because different functional groups possess distinct characteristic chemical reactivities. Positively charged capping molecules are more toxic as they could facilitate cell uptake and then reduce metabolic activity [87]. These studies demonstrated the significance of choosing SiNPs of appropriate size and surface functionalization for biomedical applications. Researchers also have evaluated in vivo\nM.

Further in vivo toxicity studies ere also extended to monkeys [24]. Monkeys showed no signs f acute toxicity over a 3 month period after injection with a dose f 200 mg kg−1 SiNPs, as confirmed by blood chemistry and histolgy of organs. However, in this study, the SiQDs were protected by\ndense, covalently-bound layer of organic ligands on their surface hat slowed or prevented their degradation. In summary, SiNPs can e regarded as biocompatible materials and show great potential in linical applications, but their surface chemistry must be controlled o provide the stability needed for any particular application while till allowing eventual degradation and clearance.\nBioavailability is the second concern that should be addressed hen considering the biomedical potential of a nanomaterial. Some esearchers have shown that the biodistribution of nanomaterils correlates with size. The enhanced permeation and retention EPR) and tumor targeting of nanomaterials are most effective for ydrodynamic diameters ranging from 20 to 200 nm [89,90]. Sun t al. performed in vivo photoacoustic imaging (PAI) with titaium ligand modified BPQDs (TiL4@BPQDs) to evaluate their in vivo iodistribution [20]. The PA signals reached a maximum at 4 h fter TiL4@BPQDs injection, which was 6 times the pre-injection ignal intensity. The signal then gradually decreased, and at 48 h ostinjection was similar to the preinjection signal. These results ndicated that ultra-small BPQDs (∼10 nm) tended to suffer from hort blood circulation half-life, attenuated EPR effects, reduced umor accumulation and rapid renal filtration. In another study, hen the researchers increased the size of BPQDs/PLGA to 100 nm iameter, considerable fluorescence from the BP nanospheres ould be detected at the tumor site at 1 h post-injection. The fluoresence gradually increased for 24 h, demonstrating slower clearance,\ngood EPR effect, and tumor accumulation of BP nanospheres Fig. 4A-E) [8]. Fluorescence at the tumor site remained strong t 48-hours post-injection, which indicated good retention of the anospheres in the tumor.\nWhen the BP nanomaterial reaches a tumor site, it could interct with cell membranes and enter the tumor cells by a cellular ptake pathway. Mei’s research group reported that the cellular ptake of BPNSs is mainly through caveolae-dependent endoytosis and micropinocytosis [32]. BP could be transported via he “micropinocytosis late endosomes lysosomes” pathway, which an be verified by detecting colocalization between caveolae and sRed-Rab5 or DsRed-Rab7, which are the markers of early endoomes and late endosomes, respectively (Fig. 4F). In order to romote targeting and uptake efficiency, they further modified EGylated BPNSs with folate to achieve better tumor targeting hrough the specific binding between folate and the folate receptors hat are overexpressed on cancer cells. The cellular fluorescence\nA staining and fluorescence intensity analysis by flow cytometry. Images reprinted\nintensity in HeLa cells after 1 h of incubation with modified BPNSs was detected by quantitative flow cytometry, and was significantly higher for the folate-modified BPNSs than for the PEGylated BPNSs without folate (Fig. 4G-H). The results of in vivo experiments agreed with the in vitro study. At 12 h post-intravenous injection of BP/Cy7 NSs and BP-folate/Cy7 NSs, a stronger signal was detected in the tumor of the BP-folate/Cy7 NSs group than in the BP/Cy7 NSs group, further demonstrating that folate targeting is feasible for in vivo applications.\nThe imaging or targeted therapy applications of SiNPs usually require conjugation of a biologically active molecule to the surface to achieve selective and efficient binding or uptake, and often involves encapsulation of the SiQDs in polymer micelles. Researchers have attached biomolecules including folate and antimesothelin directly to SiQDs [91]. These results showed that asprepared SiNPs possess desirable surface chemistry and selective uptake into Panc-1 cells. In other studies, they passivated the SiQD surface with a hydrophobic ligand layer, and then encapsulated the SiQDs in the hydrophobic core of a PEGylated phospholipid micelle [26,38]. They further combined the SiQDs with the superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs to improve the cellular uptake efficiency [70]. A magnet was placed under the macrophage cell culture dish, and the cells were incubated with the magnetic SiQD nanostructures to demonstrate magnetic guidance capabilities. The result indicated that the iron oxide NPs could increase the cellular uptake of SiQDs under an applied magnetic field. Thus, SiQD-based nanocarriers might be extended to serve as a multimodal guided platform for imaging and traceable drug delivery for cancer therapy, which will minimize damage to normal tissues.\nIn order to understand more about the SiNP behavior at the cellular level and their intracellular localization, researchers also incubated U87-MG cells with SiNPs. TEM analysis showed that SiNPs appeared mainly inside the cytoplasmic vesicular compartments, where they further formed agglomerates [92]. As SiNPs appeared in endocytotic vesicles and were never visualized inside the nucleus, SiNPs probably enter the cells by endocytosis, a common mechanism for cell uptake of inorganic NPs, and accumulate in lysosomes.\nImaging and sensing\nOptical imaging\nIn recent decades, bio-imaging has drawn great attention for imaging-guided therapy. Quantum dots (QDs) can be ideal for optical bioimaging owing to their broad excitation spectrum combined with narrow and size-dependent emission peaks. However, most widely investigated QDs are cadmium based, and therefore suffer from the risk of toxicity associated with cadmium. Recently, BPQDs\n142 M. Qiu et al. / Nano Today 25 (2019) 135–155\nM.

Furthermore, the degradation products f BP-nanodots are nontoxic intermediates. Therefore, BPQDs are ecoming a potential alternative to heavy metal-based QDs because f their good biocompatibility. In 2016, H. U. Lee et al. reported the rst study of BPQDs for potential biological imaging applications 33]. Fluorescent BP nanodots were fabricated by a solution exfolition method. In vitro experiments demonstrated that BP nanodots an be effectively taken up by HeLa cells. Upon excitation, BP nandots exhibited excitation wavelength-dependent fluorescence, nd HeLa cells could be stained with blue and green fluorescence, ndicating BP nanodots could be used for cellular fluorescence maging (Fig. 5B). In another study, Wei Tao et al. loaded fluoescent dyes, cyanine (Cy7) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), nto PEGylated BPNS to study their in vivo distribution and tumor ccumulation, and found that there were significant fluorescence ignals especially in tumor sites [32].\nWater-dispersible SiQDs provide significant advantages in QDased optical imaging for both in vitro and in vivo studies. Tilley t al. produced water-dispersible SiQDs with blue luminescence y conjugating allylamine to the SiQDs surface [14,15]. Ruckentein and coworkers developed poly (acrylic acid) modified SiQDs ith red fluorescence for fixed cell labeling [16]. In our group, e developed acrylic acid-modified water dispersible SiQDs with ellow, green and blue photoluminescence in hydrofluoric acid olution (Fig. 6A) [17]. We recently fabricated SiQDs encapsulated n PEGylated phospholipids micelles with overall nanoconstruct iameters around 100 nm in aqueous solution. The luminescence tability of these was successfully demonstrated in vivo in a prostate ancer tumor model. We demonstrated in vitro cell labeling by onfocal imaging using phospholipid-PEGylated SiQDs with panreatic cancer cells, which paves the way for SiQDs as a potential ptical probe in biomedical diagnostics (Fig. 6B). Our SiQD-based robes avoided enzymatic degradation and reticuloendothelial sysem (RES) capture, were stable in the acidic microenvironment of he tumor, and maintained bright and stable photoluminescence n vivo. SiQD-based tumor targeting, SLN mapping, and multiplex maging were demonstrated in vivo with this material. Many other maging modalities can be incorporated into SiQDs as multimodal anoplatforms for biomedical applications. For example, optical nd magnetic properties can be imparted to a single nanoplatform\ny combining SiQDs with iron-oxide NPs [70], manganese [93,94], r gadolinium [95].\noimaging of BPQDs by confocal microscopy of live HeLa cells after 12 h incubation VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.\nPhotothermal imaging\nBP can also be used for in vivo thermal imaging, taking advantage of its large extinction coefficient and high PTCE at wavelengths ranging from the ultraviolet to near-infrared. Initially, C. Sun et al. simply prepared PEGylated BPNPs by a mechanical milling technique [19]. Photothermal images of mice bearing 4T1 tumors were recorded by a thermal imaging apparatus under 808 nm laser irradiation after injection of PEGylated BPNPs. The tumor temperature increased significantly from 34 ◦C to 59 ◦C within 5 min (Fig. 7A). In order to improve the BPQD stability, J. Shao et al. fabricated PLGAcoated BPQDs and measured the PTCE to be as high as 28.4% [9]. This shows promise for hyperthermia-induced tumor ablation. The tumor temperature of mice injected with the BPQDs/PLGA NSs rose rapidly by 26.3 ◦C within 10 min under NIR laser irradiation and the maximum temperature reached 58.8 ◦C (Fig. 7B). Recently, M. Qiu et al. fabricated a BP-containing hydrogel to combine localized drug delivery with a NIR-light-activated thermal agent. The photothermal effects were monitored following intratumoral injection of BP hydrogel, and the temperature changes of BP hydrogel were recorded to rise more than 13 ◦C compared with only 5 ◦C for PBS solution (Fig. 7C) [82].\nPhotoacoustic imaging\nPhotoacoustic (PA) imaging provides high spatial resolution and deep tissue penetration for visualization of physiology and pathology of tissues. In PA imaging, photons absorbed by the biological tissue or contrast agent under pulsed illumination produce a very rapid change of temperature that generates pressure transients that are detected by an acoustic transducer. PA imaging can be used for deeper tissue imaging, compared with conventional fluorescence imaging, because the light-induced acoustic waves can penetrate biological tissues more effectively. Multimodal nanoprobe-based PA imaging techniques have also been established.\nGenerally, both photothermal and PA effects are proportional to the absorption cross-section of the contrast agent for the incident light. Therefore, a larger absorption cross-section and higher PTCE are correlated with a more pronounced PA effect. In 2016, C. Sun et al. prepared PEGylated BPNPs as a novel PA agent for cancer diagnosis [19]. In vitro experiments showed that the PA imaging performance of PEGylated BPNPs increased linearly with increasing NP concentration (Fig. 8A). In vivo experiments showed that the tumor exhibited better signal contrast than other organs such as liver and kidney after intravenous injection of BPNPs, indicating that BPNPs accumulated mainly in the tumor\n144 M.

They concluded that PEGylated BPNPs have a longer retenion time in the tumor and are cleared more rapidly from the iver and kidney (Fig. 8B). In 2017, Z. Sun et al. prepared TiL4 oordinated BPQDs as PA agents for cancer imaging [20]. The\nTiL4@BPQDs show excellent PA performance and enhanced stability in aqueous solution, compared with bare BPQDs and AuNRs.

Fundamentally, Si is an indirect bandgap semiconuctor, which implies that SiNPs have a relatively small extinction oefficient. Thus BPNPs have been used as PA contrast agents alone, hereas nanosilicon-based contrast agents have been developed or PA imaging in combination with other contrast agents, based n porous silicon constructs. Other conventional contrast agents an be encapsulated in the rigid porous silicon nanostructure which ould not only enhance the PA signal due to its low thermal conducivity but also protect the contrast agents from degradation. Zhang t al. developed silicon/carbon nanocomposites for effective PAIuided chemo and thermal tumor treatment. These silicon/carbon Ps accumulated preferentially around tumor tissue and showed ood PA signal, owing to the intrinsic large pore volume of porous ilicon and NIR absorption of carbon [22]. J. Kang et al. found that he PA signal of ICG was significantly enhanced when encapsulated ithin rigid porous silicon, compared with free ICG or ICG within a iposomal formulation. They concluded that rigid host nanostrucure with low thermal conductivity could enhance the PA signal hile protecting the ICG from degradation. They demonstrated that he ICG-loaded porous silicon was an effective PA contrast agent in n ex vivo mouse brain model [21].\niosensing\nEarly detection plays an important role in diagnosis and treatent of cancer, and the detection of serum tumor markers is one\nf the most common methods of tumor diagnosis.

In 2016, Yan et al. demonstrated the first fewlayer BP-based non-enzymatic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensor with a detection limit as low as of 10−7 M, by utilizing BP degradation under ambient conditions [96]. Kumar et al. demonstrated the first aptamer-functionalized BP-based sensing platform for the label-free detection of myoglobin (Mb), which is a cardiovascular disease biomarker [97]. This aptamer sensing platform demonstrated an ultralow detection limit of 0.524 pg mL−1 and sensitivity of 36 A pg−1 mL cm−2 for Mb in serum samples. Pumera et al. demonstrated a BPNP-based label for protein detection with high selectivity. They utilized BPNPs as electrocatalytic label for the detection of rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) in a competitive immunoassay, by the enhanced catalytic effect of BP on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [98]. They further employed BPNPs as a fluorescent sensing platform for DNA detection. A wide linear detection range as well as both low limit of detection and quantification were achieved by exploiting the affinity differences of BPNPs with fluorescence labelled single-stranded and doublestranded DNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 9A) [99]. Gu et al. developed a label-free fluorescence sensing platform for the rapid and sensitive evaluation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, by exploiting the inner filter effect (IFE) between BPQDs and 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate anion (TNB) (Fig. 9B) [100]. The as-prepared BPQDs are photostable and acid resistant, and exhibit bright green fluorescence. Ellman’s reagent (5,5′-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or DTNB), can react with thiol groups to form TNB. Based on this principle, a sensitive and label-free sensing platform was developed for fluorescence\n146 M. Qiu et al. / Nano Today 25 (2019) 135–155\nm T a b t [ c c t a a a o t w t e s o a\nb\n.V.

As a proof of concept, the platform was further used for AChE ctivity evaluation on acetylthiocholine substrate. Peng et al. have uilt a rapid and sensitive method to detect tumor markers that, for he first time, fully utilized the electronic properties of BP (Fig. 9C) 101]. They demonstrated that Au-decorated BP (BP-Au) has high atalytic activity for reduction of yellow 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to olorless 4-aminophenol (4-AP). The catalytic activity of BP-Au is urned off with carcino-embryonic antibody (anti-CEA), due to the dsorption of anti-CEA onto the Au surface, which inhibits the catlyst activity. Thus, anti-CEA will bind with a carcinoembryonic ntigen (CEA) added to form antigen–antibody complex, which desrbs the anti-CEA away from BP-Au surface, and thereby turns on he catalytic reaction. This colorimetric method for CEA detection ith high sensitivity and selectivity has potential for clinical detecion of CEA derived from colon and breast cancer patients. Zhou t al. developed a BPNS-based biosensing platform for rapid and ensitive microRNA detection [102]. Here, BPNSs were used as flurescence quenchers, and the resulting BPNS-based biosensor had\nlinear range of 10–1000 nM, with a detection limit of 9.37 nM. Extensive research has been done on the development of siliconased biosensors with high sensitivity, selectivity, and multiple\nthe fluorescence assay for the activity of AChE based on IFE mechanism.

Cui et al. used amine, biotin and antigen functionalized nanosilicon to create field-effect transistor (FET)based sensors for label-free and real-time detection of metal ions and proteins with high sensitivity (Fig. 10A) [103]. Patolsky et al. developed a nanosilicon-based FET, integrated with live mammalian neurons and individual axons, for simultaneous detection of the rate, amplitude, and shape of signals propagating along individual axons and dendrites [104]. Nanosilicon can also be used in a fluorescence sensor to detect biological and chemical species, due to the intense and stable fluorescence. Yi et al. demonstrated that the fluorescence of SiQDs could be quenched by H2O2 produced by glucose oxidase-catalyzed oxidation of glucose. This can be applied for glucose detection with high sensitivity and selectivity (Fig. 10B) [105]. Chu et al. fabricated a europium-doped nanosilicon-based ratiometric pH sensor for real-time and long-term detection of intracellular pH fluctuation in living cells [106]. To improve SERS reproducibility of free-standing metal NPs that was limited by uncontrollable size distribution and aggregation, Lee et al. prepared a series of silicon-based SERS substrates to anchor metal NPs and suppress their random aggregation [107]. The metal-decorated nanosilicon can serve as a SERS-active substrate for highly effective detection of various biological molecules (Fig. 10C).\nM.

In the past decade, anomaterial-based DDSs have been widely researched for the reatment of cancer and other diseases. BP nanosheets can effecively serve as a drug carrier for drug delivery, due to their 2D ayered structure with ultra large specific surface area. In 2016,\n. Tao et al. reported BPNSs as a robust DDS for the first time\nFig. 11A) [32]. The anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) could be oaded onto BPNSs with a maximum drug loading capacity of 108%, hich was much higher than 103̃0% typical of many NP-based elivery systems. They showed that both the NIR laser-induced yperthermia effect of BP as well as the low pH microenvironment n the cancer cells can accelerate the drug release rate. In vivo assays emonstrated that PEGylated BPNSs accumulated in tumor cells hrough EPR effect and showed good therapeutic effect. With excelent biocompatibility and no observed cytotoxicity, DOX - loaded EGylated BPNSs exhibited great antitumor effects both in vitro and n vivo. In another work, W. Chen et al. designed BP NSs as a DDS or DOX [108]. A high DOX loading capacity of BPNSs (950%) was chieved due to the large surface area and electrostatic interacion. The DOX release rate of BPNSs could be tuned by combined ction of the acidic microenvironment and laser irradiation. In vitro nd in vivo experiments demonstrated that BP NSs showed good\nstration of a glucose sensor based on H2O2-sensitive SiQDs.

Precision delivery of cancer drugs to the tumor site is crucial for improving therapeutic efficacy and minimizing adverse effects. M. Qiu et al. developed a new concept of applying external light with BPNPs to control drug delivery in cancer tissues (Fig. 11B) [82]. BPNSs, as photosensitizers, convert NIR light into local heating that can soften and melt anticancer drug-containing hydrogel nanostructures. Interestingly, the drug release rate can be tuned via several parameters, such as BP content, hydrogel composition, light intensity, and exposure time. Noticeably, optical excitation of the DOX-embedded BP hydrogel eradicated subcutaneous breast and melanoma cancers without causing any adverse effects. Moreover, this novel drug delivery system is degradable in vivo after treatment.\nSiNPs are distinguished by their effective drug loading capacity due to their high specific surface area, approaching 500 m2/g for 5 nm diameter NPs. Together with their good biocompatibility and facile functionalization, this allows SiNPs to be used for high-capacity drug delivery vehicles with tumor targeting ability [109]. SiNP-based nanoplatforms can facilitate the delivery of various therapeutic agents, such as small molecule drugs, proteins, and genes [55]. The in vivo release kinetics, biodistribution, bioavailability and side effects can be easily controlled by manipulating the size, porosity and surface chemistry of SiNPs. Due to particular physicochemical properties, SiNPs can be applied for a variety of therapeutic modalities, such as drug delivery, photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), radiotherapy and ultrasound diathermy for cancer treatment [29].

Conequently, SiQDs are suitable for more sophisticated in vivo drug elivery [25]. Collectively, the optical properties of SiQDs make hem highly suitable for diagnostics applications, for example, umor visualization, sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and image uided drug delivery.\nene delivery\nGene delivery carries genetic materials, such as RNA, DNA and ligonucleotides, into host cells to induce gene expression, inhibit ndesirable gene expression, or synthesize therapeutic proteins. delivery of specifically designed therapeutic genes into the approriate cells provides a significant advancement in disease therapy 5,6]. In recent years, nonviral transfection nanovectors for gene herapy have been a very active area of investigation.\nYin et al. developed polyelectrolyte polymer-coated BPQDs to eliver electrostatically-bound LSD1 small interfering RNA (siRNA)\nnto human ovarian teratocarcinoma PA-1 cells (Fig. 12A) [110]. SD1 is histone demethylase, maintaining the pluripotency and roliferation of embryonic stem cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs). hus, LSD1 has been used for targeting CSCs. The LSD1 gene tareting siRNA was delivered into PA-1 cells by loading on BPQDs. esearchers monitored the cellular uptake efficiency of siRNA/Cy3 sing flow cytometry analysis (FACS) and fluorescence microscopy maging. PA-1 cells treated with the BPQDs@PAH/siRNA nanocomlex showed the highest fluorescence signals, indicating that iRNA could be efficiently delivered to PA-1 cells by BPQDs. Comared to cells treated with PBS alone or with BPQDs@PAH, cells reated with BPQDs@PAH/siRNA showed a high rate of inhibition f LSD1 gene expression. Moreover, the key substrate of LSD1 amely mRNA level of SOX2 was down-regulated in cells treated ith BPQDs@PAH/siRNA. Therefore, BPQD-based nanocomplexes howed great efficacy as a siRNA delivery platform and induced nockdown of the target gene. Finally, the investigators assessed ytotoxicity of different types of BPQDs nanocomplexes. They onfirmed that the cell viability remained at 80% when the conentration of BPQDs@PAH reached 5 mg/mL, showing the good iocompatibility of these nanocomplexes. The cell growth was nhibited when treated with BPQDs@PAH/siRNA (62.1%). And he highest inhibition rate of 80% was achieved in combination\nith 808 nm NIR light irradiation. These results showed that BP anocomplexes had good synergistic therapeutic effect.\nShen et al. developed a polycation-functionalized nanoporous ilicon (PCPS) carrier for use as a gene silencing agent with high\n.

This gene delivery system could be used to deliver siRNA and microRNA to knock down cancer gene expression in tumor bearing mice [111]. They loaded siRNA into PCPS and found that incubating MDAMB-231 human breast cancer cells with this siRNA-loaded PCPS significantly reduced the target gene expression in vitro. In a MDAMB-231 breast cancer bearing murine model, the siRNA-loaded PCPS accumulated in tumor tissues after systemic delivery, reduced the expression of the target gene in cancer cells, and significantly reduced cancer stem cells in the residual tumor tissue. They further demonstrated that the siRNA-loaded PCPS did not trigger acute immune response in FVB mice at the therapeutic dosage.\nPhotothermal therapy (PTT)\nPTT has drawn much attention and been extensively explored, due to its minimal invasiveness and high therapeutic efficiency. PTT can effectively ablate cancerous cells by disrupting the cell membrane or microenvironment through highly localized heating. This rapid local heating is achieved using a light-absorbing agent as a photosensitizer to absorb photons and dissipate their energy as heat. PTT ablative therapies are based on a physical heating mechanism, and can therefore be applied for chemotherapy-resistant cancer treatment, and can promote increased tumor response in combination with chemotherapy and radiation.\nBPNSs and BPQDs display broad absorption across the entire visible and NIR spectral ranges. Thus, BP has NIR photothermal properties that can be applied for photothermal treatment. In 2015, Z. Sun et al. fabricated BPQDs by a controllable liquid exfoliation method that combined probe sonication and bath sonication methods [9]. The ultra-small BPQDs showed a large extinction coefficient of 14.8 L g−1 cm−1 at 808 nm and an excellent NIR PTCE of 28.4%. Under NIR irradiation, the BPQDs produced substantial killing of C6 and MCF7 cancer cells, demonstrating the great potential of BPQDs as PTT agents. To further improve the biostability of BP under physiological conditions, J. Shao et al. developed biodegradable BPQD/PLGA NPs with diameter around 100 nm (Fig. 13A) and enhanced stability for several weeks (Fig. 13B-D) [8]. Their in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the BPQD/PLGA NPs have negligible intrinsic cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility (the degradation process is illustrated in Fig. 13E), combined with excellent PTT efficiency and tumor targeting ability to ablate tumors under NIR irradiation.\nThe ability of radio frequency (RF) radiation to heat tissues, leading to effective necrosis of tumors, is well known and has shown promise for clinical translation.

Tamarov et al. developed a SiNP-based sensitizer of RF adiation to generate hyperthermia for cancer treatment (Fig. 14) 7]. Both by mechanical grinding of porous silicon and by ultraclean\nlaser-ablative synthesis, they developed SiNPs that can effectively generate RF-induced heating to temperatures above 455̃0 ◦C at clinically achievable concentrations (1 mg/mL). In vivo experiments demonstrated that low intensity RF radiation excitation of SiNPs can strongly inhibit the growth of carcinoma tumors, and even decrease the tumor volume.\n150 M.

PDT is nother form of phototherapy in which a photosensitizing agent is ctivate by light and then transfers its energy to oxygen molecules o produce reactive singlet oxygen (1O2) species, leading to the ecrosis of cancerous cells. Many photosensitizers (PS), including rganic molecules, heavy-atom-containing compounds, and noble etals can produce 1O2 in vivo under light irradiation. However, heir further applications have been limited by low quantum yield, asy photobleaching, or poor water solubility. Therefore, novel hotosensitizers with high 1O2 quantum yield and good biocomatibility are still urgently needed.\nIn 2015, Wang et al. first demonstrated that BPNSs can be used as photosensitizer for high efficiency generation of 1O2, which can e applied for PDT (Fig. 15A). BPNSs can generate 1O2 across the hole visible spectrum, with a quantum yield as high as 0.91 [10].\nd sensitizers. (B) TEM image (inset), electron diffraction pattern (inset) and correater.

In addition, the ability of BPNSs to degrade to biocompatible phosphorus oxides further highlights their potential for clinical translation against cancer. However, as-prepared BP can only respond to visible light for PDT, which severely limits tissue-penetration. To solve this problem, Lv et al. fabricated a multifunctional nanocomposite by loading upconversion NPs (UCNPs), that served as an energy donor, onto BPNSs via electrostatic interaction, creating a NIR light-mediated PDT agent (Fig. 15B) [11]. The UCNP component upconverts 808 nm illumination to a shorter wavelength that is absorbed by the BPNS to generate ROS, as demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo experiments. In 2017, Yang et al. developed a novel BP@Au@Fe3O4 nanocomposite by assembly of Fe O NPs and Au NPs onto BPNSs (Fig. 15C). This nanocompos-\n3 4 ite structure exhibits a wide spectrum absorption and was also photodegradable, to allow clearance of its components [18].

The SiNPs can generate 1O2 pon laser irradiation over a wide spectral range without being hotobleached, suggesting their potential as photosensitizers for herapeutic application.\neurodegenerative disorder therapy\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle for treatent of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), including Parkinson’s\nisease and Alzheimer’s disease. The BBB, which is made up of strocyte-enclosed brain capillary endothelial cells, is an imporant physiological barrier in the central nervous system. It regulates he transport of molecules from the circulatory system into the rain. Delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents across the BBB o treat NDs is still a major challenge. The BBB regulates the selecive and specific transport of exogenous and endogenous molecules o the brain. Only liposoluble molecules, alcohol, anesthetics and ome low molecular mass compounds can pass through the capilary walls. Various factors, including the surrounding surfactants, P size, and electric charge determine whether NPs can cross the BB successfully. Recently, the interface between nanomaterials nd neuroscience has opened the door for appealing new theraeutic strategies. Chen et al. demonstrated that BPNSs can have nhanced BBB permeability under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, ue to their photothermal effect [112]. Moreover, the ability of hosphorus to bind specific metal ions makes BP a robust nanocapor for Cu2+, which plays a crucial role in the etiology of NDs, uggesting that BP can be a new neuroprotective platform for ND reatment, in addition to triggering transcytosis through the BBB\nFig. 16).

They found that transport of BPNSs across the monolayer was significantly enhanced under NIR irradiation, suggesting improved BBB permeability due to the photothermal effect of BPNSs. In vitro cell viability testing indicated that almost all the cells were dead when cultured with Cu2+ and ascorbic acid (AA), implying that the elevated intracellular ROS concentration significantly decreased the cell viability of SH-SY5Y. In contrast, cell viability was recovered when BP nanosheets were added along with Cu2+ and AA, indicating BP nanosheets can protect SH-SY5Y cells from Cu2+ dyshomeostasis and oxidative stress-induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, they investigated the ability of BPNSs to cross the BBB in vivo. One hour after intravenous injection of BPNSs, the head temperature was increased to 42.2 ◦C under NIR irradiation, as indicated in Figure 18b. Both the observation of staining with Evans blue and NIR fluorescence imaging showed that transport across the BBB was improved by the photothermal effect of laser heated BP nanosheets.\nCombination and synergistic therapy\nMonotherapy is well known to suffer from poor therapeutic effect, due to drug resistance, diversity of cancer, and personal specificity of patients, leading to poor curative effect and lack of complete cure. In contrast, combination treatments of cancers have drawn research interest owing to their unique advantages including low side effects and high therapeutic efficacy. On the other hand, developing multi-functional systems for combination therapy often requires complex design and synthesis procedures, which can make it impractical for clinical applications. Recently, great progress in SiNP and BPNP technologies has brought new hopes for combination therapy. The aforementioned distinguishing properties make SiNPs and BPNPs highly promising nanoplatforms for multidisciplinary biomedical applications. BP has excellent photophysical properties that can generate 1O2 and hyperthermia for PDT and PTT. In addition, because of the puckered layered structure and relatively large surface area, BP can serve as an efficient vehicle for delivering various agents. Therefore, BPs can be utilized as plat-\n152 M. Qiu et al. / Nano Today 25 (2019) 135–155\nF o dec r einhe\nf a o m e m t p s a n c s N l N t\nT\nw a t t [ p t l o w f i\nig. 16.

A same type of strategy has also been used with silion nanowires. Guo et al. fabricated a multifunctional silicon-based ystem by decorating silicon nanowires with iron oxide and Au Ps [113].

Erogbogbo et al. integrated biomarker discovery techniques into rationally-designed SiNPs to improve the disease-specific diagnosis and treatment [30]. Therefore, SiNPs and BPNPs-based diagnosis-guided therapy shows great potential in the biomedical field.\nSummary and perspectives\nIn conclusion, this present review comprehensively summarized recent progress in SiNPs and BPNPs research, including preparation methods, fundamental properties, and biomedical applications. In the past few years, substantial effort has been devoted to the fabrication and biomedical applications of BP-based nanomaterials, whereas the history of biomedical applications of SiNPs is somewhat longer. SiNPs and BPNPs are both inorganic nanomaterials with intrinsic advantages including abundance, biocompatibility, and low cost. When one or more of their dimensions are reduced to the nanoscale, these materials develop photophysical features that make them, in some ways, superior to heavy metal-based nanomaterials for biomedical applications. Nevertheless, there are some significant differences between the two nanomaterials arising from of the fundamental dissimilarities of SiNPs and BPNPs. The most widely researched silicon nanostructures for biomedical applications are porous silicon particles and SiQDs, both of which generally require multistep fabrication processes. The lack of convenient preparation processes like those used for gold NPs or cadmium-based quantum dots has somewhat slowed the development of SiQDs in biomedical applications. In contrast to the complex fabrication requirements for SiNPs, few-\nToday\nl a i m i o\ne t m a h m m s b i\ni u t p v g t b a t T r\nt t c a M s o i w T t a b d s\ne t r i t a u p P fi c\nr m t t s\nn\nMeunier, J.

The liquid phase exfoliation\nethod is comparatively a simpler process and less expensive, and s very advantageous for scale-up production and bio-applications f the few-layer 2D BPNPs.\nToxicity of nanomaterials is difficult to assess without considring their synthetic origin, surface functionalization, size, and cell ype or experimental animal used. In the in vitro cytotoxicity assess-\nent to date, both SiNPs and BPNPs have shown minimal toxicity, nd both can be degraded to harmless products. However, SiNPs ave the subject of more in vivo studies, including a study in priates. The toxicity assessment of BPNPs to date extends only to ice and includes far fewer studies than for SiNPs. Thus, further ystematic and long-term biosafety evaluation of BPNPs must still e conducted, but all indications are that BPNPs will be biocompatble at doses useful for imaging and therapy. Because of their longer history of development, studies of imagng using SiNPs are more numerous and advanced than those sing BPNPs. Various SiQDs with good photo-stability and potenial for multicolor imaging have been developed. SiQDs with hotoluminescence at wavelengths from blue to the NIR can proide significant advantages in QD-based optical imaging and hold reat promise as valuable optical probes in biomedical diagnosics. Compared with the extensive related research on nanosilicon, io-imaging studies conducted using BPNPs photoluminescence re less numerous. BPNPs are increasingly being studied for phooacoustic and photothermal imaging under NIR laser irradiation. hese methods greatly enhance tissue penetration depth and educe the risk of phototoxicity.\nWith respect to drug delivery, SiNPs have been demonstrated o enhance delivery of various drugs in various studies showing hat nanoporous silicon could carry up to 80% loading of drugs. As ompared with silicon, a higher drug loading capacity of 950% was chieved with 2D BPNSs due to its exceptionally large surface area. ethods of loading the drug onto the two kinds of nanostructures tructure are different. Covalent attachment, physical trapping by xidation and spontaneous adsorption were utilized in the loadng process of nanoporous silicon while 2D BPNSs were coated\nith the polymers and drugs through electrostatic interactions. he nanoporous silicon could deliver more variety of drugs than he 2D BPNSs. The regular spherical shape of nanoporous silicon lso facilitated delivery and transmembrane diffusion in vivo. Thus, esides taking drug loading capacity into account, the diversity of rugs that can be loaded and the delivery efficiency should also be ubjects of further studies of 2D BPNSs.\nIn the field of cancer treatment, BPNPs were mainly developed as fficient photothermal conversion agents for PTT, while Si nanosructures have been used as sensitizers of PDT as well as for RF adiation-induced hyperthermia. RF radiation can penetrate deeper nto the body than NIR laser irradiation for PTT, which will benefit herapy of deep tumors. On the other hand, BPNSs display broader nd stronger absorbance across the whole visible spectrum. The ltra-small BPNPs exhibited large extinction coefficient and high hotothermal conversion efficiency. As a result, the dosage of BP for TT is significantly lower than the Si for RF treatment to achieve sufcient heating to inhibit the growth of cancer cells. This lower dose ould significantly reduce the potential for unwanted side-effects.\nBPNPs have become a research hotspot in the recent years, while esearch on SiNPs has begun earlier, proceeded more slowly, and ade some outstanding achievements over the past decade. Neverheless, the differences and the weaknesses of both nanomaterials hat may influence the biomedical applications must still be further tudied, before they advance from the laboratory to the clinic.\nUp to now, nearly all studies of the biomedical applications of anosilicon and BP are confined to cancer therapy. Other biofunc-\n25 (2019) 135–155 153\ntions of SiNPs and BPNPs can potentially be employed in many other multidisciplinary biomedical applications, such as antibacterial therapy, tissue engineering and progressive brain disease [116]. Finally, so far, all the silicon and BP based biomedical applications have been demonstrated in the laboratory, mainly with in vitro and some small animal in vivo experiments. Substantial additional preclinical studies are still required before the successful clinical translation. The diversity of preparation methods employed for SiNPs and BPNPs my complicate the pathway to the clinic, because pre-clinical testing of materials prepared by one method may not be accepted as a demonstration of safety or efficacy of materials prepared by another method. Because different methods produce materials that are optimal for different applications, multiple forms of SiNPs and BPNPs may have to proceed through regulatory approval processes independently. Moreover, the methods for preparing and characterizing these and other inorganic nanomaterials are often unfamiliar to regulators, and thus these materials may be treated with greater caution than more conventional drugs.\nThere is no doubt that their further clinical translation will require the participation of researchers from a variety of disciplines including nanoscience, pharmacy, medicine, and engineering. Consequently, the continuous development of silicon and BP nanotechnology will provide limitless applications in various biochemical and medical areas, and more basic research and technological breakthroughs will be achieved in the near future.\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (61435010 and 61875138); The Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen (JCYJ20170818093453105); The China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2017M610540, 2018T110892); The PhD Start-up Fund of Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (2018A030310500); The PhD Fund of Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, China (ZR2016BB33).
