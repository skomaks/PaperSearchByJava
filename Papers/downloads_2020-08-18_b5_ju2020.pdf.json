      "text" : "Because of their high intrinsic carrier mobility, conductivity, and mechanical flexibility [1–3], carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were considered as the next material to be integrated into biosensors [4], nanoswitches [5], flexible circuits [6], and field-effect transistors (FETs). However, the individual CNT-based devices require the precise control of the placement and shape of the CNT. Although several methods have been developed for the array bulk of CNTs, such as the dielectrophoresis technique [7], the orientation of CNTs could be controlled by dielectrophoresis force during the CNTs depositing the substrate surface in the liquid. Moreover, the chemical vapor deposition technique [8,9] is another method used to grow CNTs, which could directly align CNTs during the CNT growth process. However, for individual CNTs, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) [10] cantilever tip-based manipulation is more suitable for controlling the shape and placement of CNTs than the methods mentioned above, which could not control the selected CNT collection amount of aligned CNTs accurately.\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1494; doi:10.3390/nano10081494 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1494 2 of 13\nAFM tip-based nanomanipulation has been intensively studied in the past decade, helping us to fabricate nanodevices and nanostructures or conduct studies for improving our fundamental understanding of the material physical and chemical properties [11–19]. However, the AFM tip cannot perform operations of imaging and manipulation simultaneously. Moreover, scanning-manipulating-scanning reduces efficiency and effectiveness, which hinders AFM tip manipulation [20,21]. Thus, some researchers have developed feedback systems based on the manipulating forces concerning technical difficulties [22–24], such as the augmented reality system [25–27], which could monitor real-time changes of the nanoenvironment during the manipulating process by analyzing the interaction forces among the tip, substrate, and manipulating target. Some AFM tip control algorithms and drift-compensation methods were also used to push nanoparticles or nanorods [28–34]. For flexible one-dimensional nanomaterials similar to single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), a parallel pushing vector manipulating method [33,35] was developed to translate and rotate the flexible nanowires. In this method, the tip-manipulating path was optimized by the finite element method. The CNT bending process was described with a continuum beam-bending model with the clamped−clamped boundary constraints. The research group also designed an automated manipulation system with a pushing trajectory designed automatically by algorithmic programs. Moreover, some researchers have studied a geometric model to control the deforming CNT length and bending angle based on continuum mechanics to design a manipulation path and prevent the CNTs from buckling deformation [36]. However, the original shape of CNTs is challenging to maintain after the pushing operation because the large aspect ratio makes the following manipulation path difficult to predetermine to assure the designed CNTs shape after manipulating. Moreover, the deformation of CNTs will affect its electrical properties [37–39]. These problems brought challenges for nanowires manipulation. In this study, a multipoint-pushing method with a parallel path was used to push the SWCNTs. The appropriate pushing parameter combinations must be optimized to control the over shape and position accurately. Therefore, the differential evolution (DE) algorithm [40] was introduced to search for the best operating parameter combinations from the parameter spaces to maintain the SWCNTs removal integral. The DE is a population-based stochastic search method for global optimization to solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. As shown in Figure 1, the operating parameter combination of the proposed strategy includes three pushing parameters, namely, the pushing distance ∆x, the interval between the adjacent pushing path ∆y, and the pushing step n. The parameter ∆x denotes the tip travel distance perpendicular to the axis of CNT, while the interval between the adjacent pushing path ∆y is the gap distance between the adjacent tip travel paths. The parameter n is the number of repetitions of the tip traveling perpendicular to the axis of CNT. The initial value of the parameters is fed into the DE searching system to optimize the best operating parameter combinations with the feedback of the length ratio R of SWCNTs before and after pushing operation. The experimental results indicate that only 5–7 iterations are required to obtain an optimal operating parameter combination, where the length ratio could reach 0.95. With this technique, the CNTs could be transferred with its original shape and the precise position control without optimizing each parameter. Moreover, the pushing path design could prevent the AFM tip from being worn. The method does not require any specific knowledge of the manipulating mechanism and the physical properties of the nanomaterial.\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1494 3 of 13\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 13\n2.1. Manipulating Scheme\nThe first iteration of the manipulating scheme started with the implementation of four parallel\nexperiments. Moreover, the parameter combinations for these pushing experiments were generated\nrandomly within a large parameter spaces. After manipulating, the shape of CNTs may have differed\nfrom the original shape. Therefore, we used the length ratio of CNTs before and after pushing as the\nsystem objective function to evaluate the parameter combinations for the results. For the first\niteration, the experimental results could not match our expectation and provide an appropriate\nparameter combination; thus, the DE search algorithm was used in this study to suggest new\ncombinations for the subsequent iterations. By comparing the length ratio values of the first iteration\nand new iteration, the new parameter combinations with higher values were generated,\ncorresponding to an improved experimental result. Furthermore, the information was fed back to the\nsearch algorithm for the subsequent iteration. Subsequently, the search loop continued until no\nchange through iterations occurred in the objective function, which means that the CNTs’ shape after\nmanipulating reached the best state. This approach expended only a few feedback iterations to obtain\nthe best pushing operation parameter combinations without requiring any specific knowledge of the\nmanipulating mechanism and the physical properties of the nanomaterial.\n2.2. DE Algorithm\nThe stochastic search method, DE algorithm, including initialization, mutation, crossover, and\nselection, was used for finding the optimal parameter combination to push SWCNTs with precise\nshape and position control, as shown in Figure 2. In the searching procedures, three parameters,\nnamely, the pushing distance ∆x, the interval between the adjacent pushing path ∆y, and the pushing\nstep n, were used to describe the manipulating condition.

Moreover, the AFM images were obtained on tapping mode, and the pushing operation was implemented under contact mode; both operations were performed in an atmospheric environment. During scanning, 512 × 512 sample points were used to obtain high-resolution AFM images. The manipulating tip speed was set to 30 nm/s. The manipulating time of a single CNT was up to the manipulating parameters and length of the sample. SWCNT sample was prepared by a standard chemical vapor deposition process. The substrate corresponds to a silicon chip with several hundreds of nanometer thermal oxide on its surface. A 50 µL well-dispersed SWCNT suspension, diluted with an ultrasonic technique, was dropped on the Si substrate surface, and the suspension solvent was evaporated in a dry oven.

As shown in Figure 3, the free length ∆l, which is the deformation length of CNT with a single pushing path, should be higher than the interval between the adjacent pushing path ∆y. Otherwise, part of the CNT would be stayed at the original location rather than transferred to another position, during the manipulating process.

The result curves had an increasing trend with iterations; however, the parameter of the pushing distance ∆x, the interval between the adjacent pushing path ∆y, and the pushing step n decrease until reaching the value 0.95 with the parameter combination (100,100,1), i.e., ∆x = 100 nm, ∆y = 100 nm, and n = 1. Figure 6 shows the AFM images before and after pushing, corresponding to a result above 0.90. The parallel pushing path is denoted in the figure using arrows. Comparing the AFM images before and after manipulating, we found that the CNT with the peak pushing result value of 0.95 was removed, maintaining most of the original straight-line shape.

      "text" : "The pushing parameters, including the pushing distance, the interval between the adjacent pushing path, and the pushing step, affected the CNT pushing operation substantially. These parameters determine the shape of CNT after the pushing operation. In this study, the DE search algorithm was used to search the optimal pushing parameter combination to avoid the deformation of CNT during manipulation, which could maintain the straight shape of CNT after manipulation similar to before manipulation, as well as the length ratio of CNT before and after pushing operation was set as the objective function. After optimizing the scale factor F and crossover probability Cr, the values 0.4 and 0.6 were used, respectively, to search the optimal pushing parameter combination. With only six iterations and 24 pushing experiments, the best pushing parameter combination (100, 100, 1) was obtained, and the experimental result reached the length ratio value of 0.95. Moreover, the region of pushing parameters presenting values higher than 0.9 the length ratio value, with a 10% error in the measured pushing distance, was studied to provide arbitrary parameter combinations to researchers, even beyond the analyzed parameter spaces. Furthermore, having a pushing parameters region provides a favorable result for researchers to design the pushing experiments according to their demand. No need for optimizing every parameter saves time and reduces the wearing of AFM tip. Moreover, the fact that the knowledge of the physical properties of samples and the tip manipulation mechanisms are not required is another advantage of this method. Future research will try to characterize the effect of deformation on the physical property of CNTs using the proposed method. We will also try to manipulate other one-dimension nanomaterials, such as the DNA chain. This method could also be extended to other nanomaterial manipulation to assemble nanodevices with precise position and shape control.\nSupplementary Materials: The supplementary materials are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/ 10/8/1494/s1.

However, the flexible deformation during the tip manipulation modifies the original shape of these nanotubes, which could affect its electrical properties and reduce the accuracy of AFM nanomanipulation. Thus, we developed a protocol for searching the synergistic parameter combinations to push single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to maintain their original shape after manipulation as far as possible, without requiring the sample physical properties and the tip-manipulation mechanisms. In the protocol, from a vast search space of manipulating parameters, the differential evolution (DE) algorithm was used to identify the optimal combinations of three parameters rapidly with the DE algorithm and the feedback of the length ratio of SWCNTs before and after manipulation. After optimizing the scale factor F and crossover probability Cr, the values F = 0.4 and Cr = 0.6 were used, and the ratio could reach 0.95 within 5–7 iterations. A parameter region with a higher length ratio was also studied to supply arbitrary pushing parameter combinations for individual manipulation demand. The optimal pushing parameter combination reduces the manipulation trajectory and the tip abrasion, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of tip manipulation for nanowire materials. The protocol for searching the best parameter combinations used in this study can also be extended to manipulate other one-dimensional nanomaterials.",
