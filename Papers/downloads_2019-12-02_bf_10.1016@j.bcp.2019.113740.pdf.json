      "text" : "Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenous free radical that controls important physiological and pathophysiological processes, including a role in cancer biology. NO can have a direct toxic effect on tumors, or it can sensitize cancer cells and contribute to the reversal of multidrug resistance (MDR). As NO is a gas and free radical, NO donors have been investigated for their anticancer effects. In recent years, the combination of NO donors with nanomaterials has been emerging as a promising strategy to promote spatial-temporal NO release/generation directly at the target site of application (tumor tissue). Smart nanocarriers that are able to release NO under controlled stimuli have been extensively developed. Moreover, important publications have demonstrated the promising applications of NO-releasing nanomaterials in combination with traditional chemotherapies in which NO can sensitize cancer cells. In this direction, this review presents and discusses the recent progress in the design of versatile nanocarriers that are able to release/generate therapeutic amounts of NO and which can be combined with conventional anticancer therapies. These nanocarriers have the ability to release NO ondemand by external stimuli such as pH, wave, or light exposure. In addition, the possible mechanisms of NO in sensitizing tumor tissue and the impact and challenges of nanomaterials in cancer treatment are also presented and discussed. The biological and pharmacological aspects of NO donors in cancer are discussed. Finally, challenges and perspectives in the development of versatile nanoplatforms to efficiently deliver NO in clinical cancer treatment are highlighted.\nKeywords: nitric oxide, cancer, nanomaterials, drug resistance, combined therapy\n1. Introduction: Nitric oxide and cancer biology\nNitric oxide (NO) is an endogenous free radical and a signaling molecule involved\nin a wide-range of roles in the nervous, cardiovascular, reproduction, and immune systems [1,2]. Because of its small size, relative lipophilicity, and neutral charge, NO can easily diffuse through cell membranes in the absence of receptors or channels [3]. NO is known for exerting paracrine functions in the vascular wall and for its short biological half-life and diffusion distance, which can be between 1 to 10 s and 50 to 1,000 µm, respectively [4]. In vivo, NO is synthesized by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) that catalyzes the oxidation of L-arginine to L-citrulline [5]. There are three NOS isoforms: endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal (nNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS). The constitutive calcium-dependent isoforms (eNOs and nNOS) produce low concentrations of NO (i.e. pico-nano molar range), for a short time period, in regulatory mechanisms such as neurotransmission and the smooth muscle relaxation, via NO coordination with transition metal complexes such as ferrous heme iron of soluble guanylate cyclase inducing the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent NO actions [6-8]. In contrast, iNOS is a calcium-independent isoform that yields relatively high concentrations of NO (micro molar range) for longer periods of time (hours to days) upon immunological stimulation [9,10]. Indeed, iNOS is regulated by inflammatory cytokines, endotoxins, oxidative stress conditions, and hypoxia [10].\nThe NOS isoforms might be involved in both tumor proliferation and inhibition.\nLow NO concentrations are reported to cause tumor growth by increasing angiogenesis and metastasis [6,8]. On the other hand, persistently high NO concentrations produced by iNOS can have cytostatic or cytotoxic effects on tumor cells by inducing apoptosis [11]. Therefore, NO is an important and interesting molecule for oncological studies. The anti- or pro- tumoral actions of NO are dependent on its local concentration, duration of exposure, cellular redox status, redox state of NO, and the\ncompartmentalization of NO produced inside the cell (Figure 1) [8]. Different reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, respectively) can be generated from NO depending on the redox, acidic, and hypoxic cell conditions. In addition to NO, ROS and RNS can lead to significant post-translational modifications including nitration, nitrosylation, and oxidation of important biomolecules involved in cell death and proliferation [8]. Under pathological conditions, NO reacts with superoxide (O2•−) yielding the powerful oxidizing agent peroxynitrite (ONOO−). This leads to DNA oxidative damage, release of cytochrome C, enhancement of mitochondrial permeability, lipid peroxidation, and protein nitration and oxidation [10,12]. Moreover, the auto-oxidation of NO or its reaction with ONOO− produces nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a species that can promote the nitration of tyrosine moieties of proteins and thus change protein functions. Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3), formed by the reaction of NO with NO2, can nitrosate thiol-containing proteins leading to the formation of S-nitroso-proteins in a post-translational modification [10]. Accumulated oxidative and nitrosative stress damages induced by NO-related species increase the accumulation of p53 gene family members [8]. In this sense, NO produced via iNOS (and NO-related species) can induce mutations (GC to AT) in p53 and generate a loss in repressor activity in tumoral cells [13]. However, due to its dichotomous effects, NO has also been related with tumoricidal effects. In this regard, Bonavida et al. [14] demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of NO on metastasis and tumor resistance can be assigned to S-nitrosylation of NF-κB, the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 and the metastasis inducer Snail. Moreover, it has been reported that expression of tumor suppressor gene p53 is closely related with the presence of NO [15].\nDue to the importance of NO in suppressing tumor growth, there is increasing\ninterest in exploiting the therapeutic effects of NO to kill tumor cells. To this end, it is\ncritical to ensure the delivery of high concentrations of NO (micro molar range) directly to the target tissues/organs [16,17]. However, in practical applications, as NO is a free radical, it is a challenge to control its reactivity. Thus, there is an increasing appeal for the design of NO donor compounds that are able to release therapeutic and efficient concentrations of NO directly to the desired site of application (i.e., tumor tissue or organ) with minimum side effects and in a controlled and sustained manner, especially under on-demand NO release [11,16].\nLow molecular weight NO donors, such as S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs), diazenium\ndiolates (NONOates), ruthenium nitrosyl complexes, organic nitrites and nitrates are extensively employed in biomedical applications as NO donors/generators [18]. RSNOs act as spontaneous NO donors upon the cleavage of the S-N bond and NO release. Snitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and S-nitrosocysteine (Cys-NO) have been identified in biological systems [19]. NONOates such as the diethylanine/NO adduct are commercially available. In the presence of protons, these compounds release 2 mols of NO per mole of the donor, and there are different classes of NONOates with different half-lives ranging from seconds to hours or days, depending on their secondary amine chemical structures [20]. In order to enhance the efficacy of these low molecular weight NO donors, a promising and increasingly used strategy is to combine NO donors with nanomaterials for a sustained and on-demand release of therapeutic amounts of NO directly to the cancer cells. NO-delivery systems that are able to release NO donors at the target site in a controlled manner are being highly investigated in different biomedical applications, including cancer treatment [21].\n2. Advantages of nanotechnology allied with NO donors in cancer treatment\nThe release of therapeutic amounts of NO in a sustained manner directly to the\ndesired site of application is still a challenge in clinical settings. In practical situations, NO gas is used for the treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborns and for respiratory distress syndrome. However, although some progress has been achieved in the preparation of NO-releasing smart materials in laboratory settings, delivering NO in clinical situations to other organs besides the lung is still a challenge due to the relatively high reactivity of NO and its short half-life in the human body [22,23].\nDespite the availability of different classes of NO donors (S-nitrosothiols,\nNONOates, transition-metal nitrosyls), these NO donors or NO generators (organic nitrites and nitrates, among others) face practical limitations in delivering therapeutic doses of NO to the target site of application with no systemic effects and for the right time and extension. In fact, these NO donors/generators might have limited half-lives, low thermal and photochemical stabilities under physiological conditions, limited NO loading, and systemic effects [11]. To overcome these issues, a combination of nanomaterials with NO-donors/generators has been extensively explored in recent years [16,24]. Different classes of nanomaterials such as polymeric nanoparticles or nanocapsules, liposomes, metallic nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles, silica-based nanoparticles, quantum dots, peptide or carbon nanotubes, and up-conversion nanoparticles have been used for controlled NO delivery in medical applications, including cancer treatment [11,16,18]. Recently, NO donors/generators or NO prodrugs have been allied with smart nanomaterials to allow NO delivery on demand to a tumor target, thus avoiding NO inactivation and systemic undesired side effects [23].\nThe advantages of the combination of NO donors/generators with nanomaterials\ncan be summarized as follows: (i) superior stability of the NO donor/generator incorporated into the nanomaterial in comparison with free NO donor/generator, (ii)\nhigh NO loading into nanosystems due to the high surface area to volume ratio of nanomaterials, (iii) a nanomaterial delivery system can significantly increase NO concentration via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, (iv) recently, depending on the nanomaterial features, it is possible to trigger NO release directly at the tumor site by different stimuli such as pH, temperature, light input, magnetic field, among others, and (v) the ability to combine NO-releasing nanomaterials with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer treatment, where NO can sensitize cancer cells [10]. In this sense, NO releasing nanomaterials can promote a sustained NO release at sufficiently high concentrations directly to the tumor site rather than circulating to other organs/tissues. This decreases the side effects and increases the toxicity to tumor cells.\nIn nanomedicine, the EPR effect is explored in drug delivery systems. In cancer\napplications, due to angiogenesis of tumor and tumor microenvironment, nanoparticles spontaneously tend to be accumulated in the tumor tissues [25]. Moreover, NO has been explored as an EPR enhancing agent that increases nanoparticle uptake and accumulation in tumors [12]. As a vasodilator, NO promotes the smooth muscle cell relaxation, which promotes the dilation of blood vessels through the cGMP signaling pathway.\nAs the properties of the nanoparticles such as size distribution, morphology,\nchemical surface, surface charge, and degree of agglomeration play important role, several different types of nanoparticles have been prepared and evaluated as nanocarrier systems to deliver NO to cancer cells [25]. Moreover, intelligent and sophisticated approaches have been used to control NO generation by promoting NO delivery on demand. In this scenario, stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems have been prepared to release NO and/or other therapeutic drugs to tumor organs upon external stimuli such\nas temperature, magnetic field, light, or ultrasound, in addition to internal physiological features such as tumor pH, enzymatic activity, tumor receptors, redox potential, and glucose level. Recently, there has been an increasing and intense amount of research on the design of versatile and smart nanomaterials to deliver NO to tumor tissues. For instance, several size-changeable nanomaterials have been prepared. In general, small nanoparticles can better penetrate into tumors; however, they can undergo fast clearance from tumors and have relatively lower blood circulation time. In contrast, larger nanoparticles have higher tumor retention time but are poorly distributed into tumors located far from the vasculature, leading to heterogenous intratumor drug distribution [25]. Thus, nowadays to overcome this issue, size-changeable nanoparticles have been prepared. In this sense, this manuscript presents the recent achievements in the development of smart nanomaterials that are able to deliver NO to tumor cells, especially by external stimuli. Moreover, two approaches are presented and discussed: (i) the direct application of NO-releasing nanoparticles against cancer via the direct toxic effects promoted by NO and (ii) the combination of traditional chemotherapies with NO-releasing nanomaterials in which NO can sensitize cancer cells. In both cases, the design of smart nanomaterials that are able to release or generate therapeutic amounts of NO on-demand by external stimuli is represented.\n3. Selected examples of NO-releasing/generating nanomaterials for cancer\ntreatment: direct toxic effect\nThis section presents and discusses select publications based on the recent\nprogress in the design of NO-releasing/generating nanomaterials for their direct toxic effects against cancer.\nCommercial platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs, size 3 nm) were used to catalyze NO\ngeneration from endogenous S-nitrosothiols (S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and SNitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP)), under physiological conditions, as assayed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy [26]. NO generated from S-nitrosothiol decomposition upon administration of Pt NPs promoted cytotoxicity to human A549 lung cancer cells. A 10-fold higher NO release from SNAP was promoted by Pt NPs administration, compared to the SNAP alone. The catalytic mechanism of NO generation was assigned to the Pt-S bond formation upon incubation of S-nitrosothiols and Pt NPs [26]. Although a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect was observed, this approach was only tested in vitro; thus, in vivo studies are required. Moreover, this is an indirect approach, because Pt NPs are not specific for generation of NO from endogenous S-nitrosothiols, and these nanoparticles might have toxic effects.\nHollow double-layer S-nitrosothiol imprinted polymer nanoparticles were\nspecifically developed for the targeted treatment of sialic acid (SA) overexpressed tumors [27]. Due to the selective binding properties of the imprinted polymers with SA overexpressed tumors, cell uptake and a fast NO-release were promoted. This was induced by intracellular glutathione (GSH), which enables the use of S-nitrosothiol as chemotherapy. The synthesized nanoparticles presented an average size of 582 nm and a maximum NO release of 1.8 µmol mg-1 with a half-time (t1/2) of 220 min. The targeted potential of these nanoparticles was evaluated against SA overexpressing HepG2 (human liver carcinoma cells) and low SA expressing HeLa (cervical cancer cells). After 1 h of incubation, it was possible to confirm the internalization of polymeric nanoparticles in HepG2 cells through a fluorescent marker, while no fluorescence was observed for HeLa cells. This confirms the intelligent selectivity of these nanoparticles. Additionally, in vivo experiments were carried out, and these confirmed a significant\ninhibition of tumor growth with no significant side effects, indicating an effective NObased chemotherapy. These results highlight the promising use of both NO-based chemotherapy and molecule-imprinting cell recognition. These enable targeted treatment for various forms of cancer and reduce the usual side effects observed in current chemotherapies [27].\nAnother interesting approach using a polymeric matrix to deliver NO is the use\nof branched polymers like cyclodextrins (CDs). CDs are cyclic oligosaccharides composed of glucopyranose units (α-, β-,γ-CD). In Malanga et al., the authors chemically modified the glucopyranose units of CD to have a green florescent moiety in 1a and a NO donor in moiety 1b, as shown in Figure 2 [28]. The results showed that irradiation at 405 nm (blue light) were effective in releasing NO from the cleavage of the O–NO bond, in the presence of green florescence. The NO release only occurred under blue light irradiation. The polymer was internalized in A431 human squamous carcinoma cells, as assessed by confocal microscopy. The cells in dark conditions have moderate toxicity (ca. 90% of cell viability), whereas irradiation at 405 nm caused higher toxicity (ca. 40% of cell viability). Therefore, the cells tolerate the polymer in dark conditions, but considerable cell mortality was observed as a result of NO photo release under light excitation.\nPhotodynamic therapy was used to deliver NO by synthesizing S-nitrosocysteine\nallied to TiO2 nanotube-doped PbS quantum dots [29]. This methodology resulted in a hybrid nanomaterial (average size of 3.6 nm) capable of photo-releasing NO and singlet oxygen by near-infrared light, and it may have potential in photodynamic therapy [29].\nNO-releasing ruthenium nitrite complexes have also been studied as\nchemotherapeutic drugs. The behavior of two distinct complexes was investigated against the melanoma cancer cell line (B16F10): (i) cis-[Ru(py-\nbodipy)(dcbpy)2(NO2)](PF6) and (ii) cis-[Ru(py-bodipy)(dcbpy-aminopropyl-βlactose)2(NO2)](PF6) [30]. Both complexes demonstrated tumoricidal effects in vitro at high concentrations of NO-release. But at low-concentrations of NO-release, the opposite effect was observed by the growth of cancer cells. Cytotoxic effects demonstrated concentration-dependent results in which 150 µmol L-1 was the observed cytotoxic concentration for both ruthenium-complexes against B16F10 cells. The internalization of both compounds was evaluated by flow cytometry, which provided evidence for the presence of both complexes in mitochondria [30]. Thus, these results show the potential use of NO-releasing ruthenium-complexes as chemotherapeutic agents, call attention to the ideal concentration of these compounds, and open new venues for optimization in the use of these classes of NO-donors.\n4. Advantages of the combination of NO donors, nanomaterials, and\ntraditional chemotherapy\nAs an endogenous messenger, NO controls important physiological and\npathological processes such as apoptosis, cell growth, cell death, vasodilation, immune response, and neurotransmission [2]. The actions of NO in biological systems are diverse, and in cancer biology, high overall concentrations of NO are toxic to cancer. In contrast, more recently, it has been demonstrated that at low concentrations, NO can act as sensitizer agent of cancer cells by down-regulating P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression levels and reversing multidrug resistance (MDR) [31]. MDR overexpresses drug transporters, such as P-gp, by pumping the chemotherapeutic agents out of the cells, impairing the accumulation of the drug. In this direction, NO cannot only directly kill tumor cells, but also it can act in alliance with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, such\nas cisplatin and doxorubicin, and therapeutic methods, such as radiotherapy, to sensitize tumors cells [21,32]. In addition, NO donors can also sensitize tumor cells by Snitrosylation reactions of critical thiol-containing biomolecules such as DNA repair enzymes [8]. Overall, NO donors can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs by reducing P-gp levels, inactivating hypoxia-induced factor, depleting GSH (that is known to inactivate anticancer drugs, such as cisplatin), and inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B [14,33,34].\nMoreover, nanomaterials have been extensively used in medicine, in particular in\ncancer treatment and diagnosis [35]. Thus, the combination of NO donors, traditional anti-cancer therapies, and nanomaterials has been recently emerging as a versatile and powerful approach to combat cancer cells. Nanomaterials not only carry NO donors/generators but also chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, they enhance drug uptake by the EPR effect and help bypass MDR pathways [21].\nThe benefits of the combination of NO donors/generators, nanomaterials, and\ntraditional chemotherapy can be highlighted but are not limited to the following [16, 36- 39]:  Down-regulation of P-gp expression levels and thus reversing MDR;  As NO is a vasodilator, NO can enhance the oxygen concentration in tumors, reducing hypoxia-related tumor resistance. This feature might be beneficial for overcoming radio-resistance;  Superior uptake of NO donors and chemotherapeutic drugs due to the EPR effect assigned to the nanomaterials;  Depending on the nature of the nanomaterial, high and localized concentrations of ONOO−, a powerful oxidizing and nitrating agent, are generated leading to cancer\ncell death. This therapy is enhanced by the combination of NO donors and X-ray controlled generation of ONOO− from engineered nanoparticles;  Ultrasound therapy allows energy transfer from sonosensitizers to oxygen molecules yielding ROS;  Photodynamic therapy (PDT) allied to NO donors and nanomaterials can enhance the production of ROS and thus efficiently kill tumor cells upon an external photo stimulus;  Nanomaterials can be designed to release NO and the therapeutic drug on demand (in a controlled manner upon external stimuli) directly to tumor cells with minimum side effects to the normal cells.\n5. Selected examples of the combination of NO donors and traditional\nchemotherapy to combat cancer\nLooking forward to improving traditional chemotherapy and overcoming MDR\ncancer cells, a combined paclitaxel (PTX) and NO-release pH-sensitive liposomal system was developed for targeted drug delivery [31]. The reported liposomal system was coated with monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-poly(L-lysine)- graftdimethylmaleic anhydride (PEG-PLL-DMA). This design led to pH sensitive properties, because the system was negatively charged at pH 7.4 and positively charged at pH 6.5, which enabled targeted release in a tumor environment. Diethylenetriamine diazeniumdiolate was used as the NO-donor, contributing to pH sensitive properties that provided quick release of NO under acid conditions but prolonged the circulation at blood pH. The synthesized liposomes presented an average size of 150 nm and negative zeta potential. The pH sensitivity was confirmed, indicating that the liposome was\nnegatively charged during blood circulation and positively charged in an acid environment, which confers a targeted drug delivery and prolonged blood circulation. The pH sensitivity property also contributed to a higher release of both NO and PTX in acid pH when compared to blood pH, increasing antitumoral efficacy [31]. The influence of pH change in the application of liposomes is shown in Figure 3. The properties of the synthesized delivery agent resulted in positive effects for both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Cellular uptake was increased when compared to non-pH sensitive vehicles. Moreover, NO release downregulated the expression of Pglycoproteins and it was overexpressed in MDR cancer cells, enhancing PTX antitumoral efficacy. In vivo antitumoral assays indicated the smallest tumor volume and weight for the proposed system when compared to free chemotherapeutic and to non-pH sensitive vehicles. Moreover, no obvious abnormalities or alterations were observed in major organs, indicating slight side effects [31]. Thus, promising potential for cancer treatment was achieved by the combined NO/chemotherapeutic drug with a targeted delivery. As previously reported, the combination of NO and other chemotherapeutic drugs represents a promising strategy, because it may overcome defense mechanisms developed by MDR cells such as the activation of DNA repair mechanisms, the stimulation of detoxification paths, and other characteristic properties. Kim and coworkers highlighted strategies associated to P-glycoprotein, which mediated the efflux of cytotoxic agents, as one of the most employed [21]. Thus, this venue might be a targeted strategy for different innovative NO combined therapies in the near future.\nAnother strategy for targeted tumor delivery in nanoscale matrices was\ndemonstrated by Dong and coworkers [12]. They evaluated an innovative protein-free collagen depletion in a tumor microenvironment that was based on the use of NO to activate metalloproteinases. Metalloproteinases are able to disintegrate a tumor matrix\nand facilitate nanoparticle penetration [12]. To assess the potential of the proposed targeted drug delivery, mesoporous silica nanoparticles were loaded with S-nitrosothiol and DOX as a model chemotherapeutical drug. This led to negatively charged nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic diameter of 107 nm (Figure 4). In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that DOX-loaded particles presented a pronounced effect on the cytotoxicity against tumoral cells as well as on the inhibition of tumor growth (Figure 4). Three important results with NO-loaded nanoparticles must be highlighted: (i) improved penetration and accumulation in tumors, (ii) enhanced tumor inhibition was observed for the proposed nanoparticle, and (iii) decompression of constricted blood vessels (2-fold increase with NO-loaded NPs). The highlighted results indicated an improved combined therapy based on a more efficient penetration of the vehicles into the tumor sites [12].\nPromising results were also reported for a combined therapy of\nnanoencapsulated NO-donor and cisplatin. Different from the previous works in which NO donors and chemotherapeutic drugs are combined in the same nanoparticle, Duong et al. reported a pre-treatment with the NO-releasing nanoparticles, looking forward to sensitizing the tumor cells for a posterior treatment with cisplatin [22]. This approach demonstrated positive effects in vitro against tumoral neuroblastoma cells, resulting in a synergistic effect with a 5-fold increase in the cisplatin cytotoxicity, compared to nonpretreated cells. Interestingly, the pre-treatment did not affect non-tumoral cells, and it only improved the cytotoxicity against tumoral cells [22]. Further works with different therapeutic drugs and in vivo models are still required to better investigate NO pretreatment for sensitization of tumoral cells.\nBesides the commonly employed nanoparticles, such as polymeric or silica\nnanoparticles, titanium dioxide (TiO2) mesoporous nanoparticles present huge potential\nregarding antitumoral applications. This is especially due to their accumulation and permeation in tumor sites and to the retention effect (EPR effect). Tirapamazine (TPZ) and NO-releasing TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized for theragnostic application in combination with sonodynamic therapy (SDT) [38]. This nanosystem was designed to reach the tumor tissue based on the EPR effect followed by the NO-sensibilization stimulated by SDT combined with TPZ therapy, leading to cancerous cell death. Moreover, simultaneous diagnosis can be performed through the ultrasound imaging technique that identifies the NO generation process. The nanoplatform demonstrated a high drug load with an increased release at pH 5.8 when compared to blood pH, suggesting a targeted delivery. The NO release in an anticancer therapeutic window was also efficiently achieved through ultrasound irradiation. In vitro assays confirmed the synergism between the components in the nanoplatform. This was evidenced by a pronounced decrease in the viability of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). In vivo results corroborated previous investigations, successfully suppressing breast cancer in tumor-bearing nude mice to a volume lower than the initial volume [38]. This approach opens venues for enhanced targeted applications with other surface functionalization, different chemotherapeutic drugs and also other gaso-transmitters that present promising potential.\nGuo et al. demonstrated a stimulated NO-based therapy by using intelligent\nnear-infrared laser-triggered (NIR) instead of SDT, as reported by Feng et al. The reported nanoplatform is based on magnetite and a silica core-shell structure with high porosity. This enables loading of DOX besides NO-release through a thiol functionalization on the surface of the particles [40]. The NIR irradiation increases the temperature and promotes the breakdown of S-NO bonds, triggering NO release from the nanoparticles and providing a combined therapy based on a common chemotherapy,\nheat sensitivity, and NO inhibition of P-glycol in MDR cells. This nanoplatform presented an average diameter of 230 nm with a thick 40 nm silica shell that was able to load 18.4% of DOX. The effects of the designed delivery system were firstly confirmed in vitro using a multidrug resistant breast cancer model (MCF-7/ADR) and a common breast cancer cell line (MCF-7). The resistance was confirmed with pure DOX treatment, indicating low suppression of the MCF-7/ADR cell line in comparison with MCF-7. The results confirmed a higher cytotoxicity for the combined therapy, reversing the resistance of MCF-7/ADR cells. In vivo studies were also evaluated against MCF7/ADR tumor-bearing nude mice, corroborating in vitro results. Tumor growth presented significant inhibition when treated with the nanoparticles combined with irradiation, and there were no apparent side effects [40].\nAn intelligent strategy for delivering nanoparticles was proposed by Hu and\ncoworkers [25]. The nano-delivery structure was based on DOX-loaded dendrimers coated with a modified hyaluronic acid shell. This nanostructure promoted NO release when irradiated by NIR; besides, the system targeted hyaluronidase, an enzyme highly expressed in tumor microenvironments, conferring a targeted property for this nanoparticle. Moreover, indocyanine green, a drug recently approved, corroborates by increasing the temperature when irradiated by NIR. Both in vitro and in vivo results proved the targeted delivery and a deep penetration of the nanoparticles in tumoral cells. It resulted in a high cytotoxicity in breast tumor cells and a pronounced decrease of breast tumor growth ratio [25].\nSimilar to previous work, Huang et al. demonstrate a NO therapy combined with\nphotothermal therapy by using a novel protoporphyrin-based polymeric nanoparticle. The synthesized structure demonstrated a hydrodynamic size of 108 nm that is in accordance with the solid-state size of 73.4 ± 10.9 nm evaluated by transmission\nelectron microscopy (TEM). These small polymeric nanoparticles presented an efficient NO-loading at therapeutic concentrations (10.15 μmol L-1) in which anti-growth and apoptosis effects were observed. The characterization of the nanoparticles indicated high NO-release, as well as temperature increase when combined with laser irradiation. The cytotoxicity against multidrug resistant MCF-7 cells indicated that no positive effects were observed without irradiation. In vivo results confirmed the synergistic effect of the treatment, demonstrating tumor inhibition up to 94.9% in the combined treatment with no significant side effects. Thus, the localized release of NO and high temperature demonstrated successful results in both in vitro and in vivo tests [41].\nTumoral cells are known to have high levels of GSH in their cytosol.\nGlutathione S-transferases π (GSTπ) and NO donor pro-drugs were encapsulated in hybrid nano-micelles of polystyrene-block-poly(acrylic acid) [42]. The nano-micelles showed a hydrodynamic size of 100 nm. Upon cell internalization and in the presence of GSH, the nano-micelles degrade and release NO donor pro-drugs, and GSTπ. This hypothesis was confirmed by the incubation of nano-micelles in a GSH containing medium and measurement of nitrite (NO2-) formation by the colorimetric Griess method. GSTπ (1- 5 µg mL-1) encapsulated into nano-micelles produced NO2- (ca. 10- 12 µmol L-1). The cell viability and the flow cytometry analysis were evaluated using a normal liver cell line and different liver cancer cell lines (Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721). The results showed efficient tumor-targeting capability with a higher toxicity against tumor cell lines in comparison with normal cells. However, higher values of IC50 were found for the encapsulated pro-drug compared with its free form. In vivo experiments were performed using tumor-bearing mice injected with micelles. The micelles were accumulated at the tumor site and showed a significant tumor mass reduction of ca. 80% [42].\nPt-based drugs such as cisplatin have been widely used in cancer treatment;\nhowever, they have some limitations and toxicity, including the existence of biomolecules associated deactivation, drug resistance, nonspecific delivery, and side effects. In order to overcome these limitations, several authors have studied the encapsulation of Pt-based drugs in nanoparticles. Indeed, cisplatin was encapsulated in silica nanoparticles with NO loaded to a silica matrix [43]. The nanoparticles showed a size of 48 ± 6 nm, as assessed by TEM. The NO release was 37-50 µmol g-1 after 6 days. The toxicity against cancer cell lines was significantly higher for the NO releasing nanoparticle compared to control groups. In vivo studies demonstrated that NO induced tumor death sensitization, and NO-releasing nanoparticles are promising enhancer agents for platinum-based cancer therapies [43].\nIn a similar strategy, nanoparticles that are able to release platinum (IV) pro-\ndrug and NO were prepared [33]. Platinum (IV) pro-drugs were chemically modified to release NO upon light irradiation to sensitize cancer cells. The NO release was measured using the chemiluminescence method and showed a light-dependent NO release profile. The therapeutic potential of this material was evaluated using human colon cancer and MCF-7 cells. The results showed an enhanced platinum uptake by cancer cells upon its association with NO. In addition, intracellular NO release was observed by confocal microscopy of cells treated with diaminofluorescein –2, and this also showed higher toxicity in comparison to nanoparticles without NO [33]. In a similar approach, the NO donor ruthenium nitrosyl (Ru-NO) was combined with platinum (IV) pro-drug and folate decorated graphene quantum dots [44]. The nanoplatform was able to intracellular co-deliver NO and Pt(II) under 808 nm light irradiation [44].\nA nano-micellular system able to carry and to deliver DOX, NO and adjudin\n(ADD) was prepared [45]. A D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate-based NO donor was allied to a DOX−ADD conjugate self-assembly (micelles). The micelles were incubated with MCF7/ADR cells and showed a higher cell uptake and cytotoxicity than the components alone. In vivo, adult Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with micelles and showed an accumulation of the micelles on the tumor site and significantly fewer metastatic nodules on lungs [45].\nRecently, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs, size of 9 nm), synthesized by plant extract,\nwere combined with the NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione into flexible polymeric solid films of poly(vinyl alcohol, PVA) and poly(ethylene glycol, PEG) [46]. The films were able to release both NO and AgNPs. Films containing NO donor and AgNPs demonstrated higher toxicity to human prostate cancer cell (PC3) and to human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) in comparison with cells treated with films containing AgNPs or the NO donor individually. The synergistic effect of S-nitrosoglutathione and AgNPs on tumor cells is still under investigation, and it is not completely elucidated. These polymeric films have potential uses in topical applications to combat solid tumors.\nCore-shell magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with polydopamine and S-\nnitrosoglutathione were prepared [47]. The anticancer drugs docetaxel (DTX) and DOX were incorporated into nanoparticles with respective loading efficiencies of 223 and 243 µmol/g, respectively. The nanoparticles (average size of 9 nm) were toxic to the PC3 cell line by promoting apoptosis, as assessed by flow cytometry [47].\nChitosan (CS)-encapsulating NaYF4:Yb,Er nanospheres (UCNPs) is another\napproach for sustained drug delivery in cancer treatment. Tan et al. integrated this nanoparticle with DOX and with a photosensitive NO donor (Roussin’s black salt, RBS) yielding stimuli-responsive nanoparticles UCNPs(DOX)@CS-RBS. The synthesized\nnanospheres (size of 27 nm) absorbed NIR light, which was converted to visible light to enhance NO release (under 980 nm irradiation). Under acidic pH (typically found in solid tumors), DOX is released from swollen nanomaterials. Interestingly, the combination of NO and DOX demonstrated a synergistic toxicity for colorectal cancer (CT26) cells and MCF-7/ADR cells, as verified by MTT and annexin V-FITC/ PI cell apoptosis assays. The in vivo antitumor efficacy of UCNPs(DOX)@CS-RBS nanospheres was demonstrated in BALB/c mice bearing a CT26 tumor, and they exhibited efficacy for inhibition of tumor growth according to the NIR time exposed (resulting in 73.5% and 80.2% tumor reduction after 5 min and after 30 min of NIR irradiation, respectively). In this way, in vitro and in vivo assays confirmed the synergistic effect of the UCNPs treatment, demonstrating that NO-reduced the MDR effect and increased intracellular levels of DOX [48].\nROS are produced during important intracellular mechanisms, including cancer\ninitiation. However, high doses of ROS have the ability to damage malignant cells. In this direction, Wan et al. investigated a tumor-specific ROS-responsive nanoparticle system allying NO and sensitized PDT. To this end, porphyrinic metal-organic nanoparticles (PCN) were combined with the NO generator L-Arginine, and the surface of the nanoparticles was coated with cancer cell membrane (L-Arg@PCN@Mem). The nanoplatform, activated by NIR, was able to produce many ROS, which are important in PDT, and it promoted further reaction to converse L-arginine to NO. The production of ROS and NO resulted in a synergistic treatment to improve PDT in hypoxic solid tumors [49].\nAnother approach for cancer phototherapy was based on the design of pH-\nsensitive diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative nanoparticles (DDPs) [50]. In this methodology, a NO photodonor (4-nitro-3-trifluoromethylaniline, NF) and a pH-\nsensitive moiety (dimethylaminophenyl) were linked to a diketopyrrolopyrrole core (DDP-NF). The DDP-NPs are activated in lysosome acid medium and generate ROS and thus enhance photothermal therapy (PTT). In vitro assays performed on HeLa cells by MTT and flow cytometric measurements demonstrated high toxicity under light irradiation with less toxicity in dark conditions. In vivo phototherapy experiments were performed using tumor-bearing mice. This indicated that DDP-NF NPs exhibited synergistic PTT and PDT therapies that effectively targeted tumors via EPR effect. Thus, the localized release of NO and pH-activated PDT and PTT therapies demonstrated successful results in both in vitro and in vivo tests [50].\nSeveral approaches have been employed to maximize the accumulation of\nnanoparticles in tumors. Wei et al. developed tumor-targeted DOX-loaded hybrid polymeric micelles integrated with NO donor (S-nitrosoglutathione) (Figure 5). These polymeric micelles were stable under neutral conditions. However, under mildly acidic environments such as in tumor tissues, they promote exposure of cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptides (cRGD) and allow micelles accumulation in tumor blood vessels. The in situ NO generated by copper decomposition of endogenous NO donors led to dilation of blood vessels and enhanced the EPR effect of the nanoparticles. This favors the rapid release of DOX to kill tumor cells [51]. The cell viability was evaluated using mouse breast carcinoma cells (4T1) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The results revealed a concentration-dependent toxicity, and the IC50 value for DOX-loaded micelles in the presence of cRGD (IC50 = 2.884 μg mL−1) was higher to free DOX (IC50 = 2.064 μg mL−1). These suggested that peptide targeting ligand enhances the process of nanoparticle internalization. In vivo antitumor activity assay was carried out using 4T1 tumor-bearing mice injected with micelles. The NO release was enhanced by the EPR effect of micelles caused by vasodilation, thus providing a high accumulation of DOX,\nleading to a large inhibition of tumor growth (94%), in comparison with DOX alone (Figure 5). In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that DOX-loaded hybrid polymeric micelles showed important cytotoxic effect against tumoral cells as well as on inhibiting tumor growth [51].\nCarbon dot (CD) based nanoplatforms were used to catalyze NO generation\nfrom a ruthenium nitrosyl (Ru-NO) complex in a multimodal tumor photothermal therapy [52]. In this approach, the NO donor-based lysosome, Lyso-Ru-NO, and folicacid (FA) (to target the nanomaterial to cancer tissue) were incorporated into CDs forming a nanoplatform (Lyso-Ru-NO@FA@CDs). The resultant nanoparticles showed a spherical morphology with sizes ranging from 7 to 9 nm and a selective targeting ability to accumulate in the lysosomal organelle. The NO generation mechanism was catalyzed by laser irradiation at 808 nm. The light exposure time was proportional to NO released concentration (maximum 8.0 mM). NO generated from Ru-NO decomposition promoted high cytotoxicity against HeLa and A459 cells under 808 nm NIR laser irradiation [52].\nSimilarly, the application of 808 nm NIR laser to generate NO was also\ndemonstrated by Zhang et al. In this methodology, a nanoplatform based on upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) was integrated with NO donor Roussin’s black salt. The synergistic effect of DOX and NO in the human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) caused cell apoptosis. In addition, the study presented for the first time the efficient combination of NO and DOX to inhibit and reverse chemo-drug resistance in cancer stem-like cells [53].\nAnother interesting strategy using the combination of NO donors with\nnanomaterials to target release on cancer cells was based in self-assembled polymeric\nnanoparticles [23]. A NO pro-drug (alkynyl-JSK) and chemotherapeutic drug (DOX) were incorporated into a triblock copolymer (p(Gal-b-DPA-b-Az)). This led to a copolymer that self-assembles into nanoparticles (p(GD-Az-JSK)/DOX NPs) with 45 nm size. The efficiency of encapsulation and drug loading of alkynyl-JSK and DOX were 61.33% and 5.01%, respectively. The combination of NO and DOX demonstrated an efficient synergistic therapy for a tumor cell line (human hepatocellular cancer cells (HepG2)). In vitro cellular uptake assays showed efficient internalization of p(GD-AzJSK)/DOX NPs by HepG2 endocytosis. NO was generated under intracellular glutathione catalysis, culminating in the rapid release of DOX from the nanoparticles. The IC50 values were decreased when the culture time was extended up to 72 h. In addition, the apoptotic rate was further enhanced (86.4% to 98.4%) by adding DOX. The NO toxic effects on cancer cells occurred via direct generation of ROS. These reactions trigger cellular responses ranging from modulations involving cell signaling to oxidative damage, causing cell necrosis or apoptosis [23].\nMultiple stimuli-responsive biodegradable nanospheres (SDC@NS) were used\nto catalyze NO generation from SNAP [54]. This approach combined a photothermal agent (cypate), a chemotherapeutic agent (DOX), and a NO donor (SNAP) for synergistic anticancer applications under NIR irradiation. The resultant nanospheres showed sizes of about 110 nm and 253 nm, as assessed by TEM and DLS, respectively. The rates of NO and DOX release from the nanocarrier were accelerated by hyperthermia under 808 nm laser irradiation and the presence of GSH. The combination of NO with DOX promoted a higher cell uptake and enhanced the apoptosis of MCF7/ADR cells. The synergistic therapy of SDC@NS + NIR enhanced tumor tissue ablation in vivo [54].\nAs demonstrated here, versatile nanocarriers have been designed in combination\nwith NO donors/generators, traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, and/or external stimuli allied with nanomaterials to enhance toxic effects on tumor cells. Table 1 highlights the recent progress in this approach.\n6. Biological and pharmacological aspects of NO in cancer\nAs demonstrated in the previous sections, the combination of NO-releasing\nnanomaterials with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs is a promising approach in cancer treatment [21]. NO might play different roles when combined with nanomaterials/chemotherapeutic drugs, enhancing the efficacy of the treatment, and reducing cell resistance. The anticancer effects of NO/NO-releasing nanomaterials are not completely elucidated and involve multiple pathways. For instance, the combination of NO with platinum-based drugs induced the GSH depletion in cancerous cells, reducing the inactivation of the chemotherapy [55]. In addition, it has been reported that NO acts as a chemosensitizer through NF-κB pathways, downregulating drug resistance [34]. Moreover, other anticancer mechanisms have been proposed for the co-therapy of traditional chemotherapeutic drugs and NO donors. In this sense, De Luca and coworkers suggested that NO improves the anticancer effects of DOX by facilitating the drug binding to nuclei acids [56].\nDespite presenting important roles in combined treatments, NO itself is known as\na potent cellular messenger, involved in autophagy process, which might affect immunity, neurodegeneration, and cancer. NO is known as an inhibitor of the activity of S-nitrosylated substrates, mostly represented by mitochondrial proteins or proteins related to metabolism, such as c-Jun-N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and IκB kinase β\n(IKKβ) [57]. The inhibition of these substrates directly affects Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) that regulates the pathways involved in apoptosis, and AMPK (AMP-dependent protein kinase), involved in the activation of the protein kinase mTORC1, via tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2), regulating autophagy [58]. The inhibition of JNK1, as a result of the S-nitrosylation, reduces the phosphorylation of Bcl-2, increasing Bcl-2-BECLIN 1 interaction and inhibiting the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3) complex, resulting in a proautophagic pathway [59]. A different mechanism is described by the phosphorylation enhancement of AMPK through the activation of IKKβ, decreasing mTORC1 activity and leading to the opposite effect, inhibiting autophagy [60]. Additionally, a direct S-nitrosylation of TSC2 might induce the activity of mTORC1, also supporting an autophagy inhibitor effect of NO [60]. NO can inhibit or induce autophagy [60]. Recent studies evidenced that NO affects mTOR classical pathway by different routes. For instance, in breast cancer cells, diazenium-diolate NO donor demonstrated to induce autophagy in cancer cells, evidenced by autophagy marker microtubule light chain 3-II, without affecting normal mammary epithelial cells [61]. On the opposite, NO donors increased the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase 1, indicating activation of mTORC1, inhibiting autophagy [58]. It is important to highlight that the inhibition of autophagy induce cell death in stress condition, such as during chemotherapeutic treatments, although high levels of autophagy promote cell death via self-cannibalization, as illustrated in Figure 6 [62]. In this sense, both up and down-regulating mechanisms of autophagy reported for NO donors represent promisor approaches in cancer treatment, especially when combined with other drugs. Besides autophagy related pathways, NO has shown to induce genetic mutations that affect DNA integrity and mitochondrial physiology, specifically in its respiratory chain [63]. At high concentrations (micro molar), NO promotes the inhibition of cancer growth,\ninvolving pathways such as the phosphorylation of protein kinase B and the generation of detrimental conditions, known as nitrosative stress [63].\nThus, NO is shown as a potential molecule in the treatment of cancer and there is still plenty of room to be explored concerning the mechanisms involved in NO therapy and/or co-therapy, regarding autophagy and apoptosis regulation, in order to improve current cancer treatments. The cross-talk between NO-releasing nanomaterials and the modulation of autophagy should be further investigated.\n7. Conclusion: perspectives and challenges\nRecently, significant progress has been achieved regarding NO and cancer. The\nexact anticancer mechanism of NO and NO-related species involves several pathways and players [14,33,64]. This is still a matter of intense investigation, and the administration of NO donors to cancer cells has been explored with positive perspectives [65]. Important reports have shown that low concentrations of NO (those that if administrated alone would be able to promote tumor growth) can mitigate the negative effects of MDR. As a consequence, there is an intense motivation to combine NO donors with nanoparticles to enhance chemotherapy. Indeed, NO donors allied with nanomaterials are able to directly kill cancer cells or to sensitize cancer cells to traditional therapies (Table 1). Both strategies are under intense investigation by the scientific community, as highlighted in this review. The promising results reported so far have motived and inspired researchers to design different kinds of smart nanomaterials (metallic, silica and/or polymeric nanocarriers) containing different classes of NO donors/generators (S-nitrosothiols, Ru-complexes, diazeniumdiolates, organic nitrate and nitrate, etc.). Moreover, control of external stimuli such as light,\nmagnetic field, temperature and tumor microenvironment features (pH, redox state, level of oxygen, etc.) can be used to promote local and sustained NO generation (that can be in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs) which enhances the therapy efficacy and minimizes side effects.\nAlthough the EPR effect can spontaneously increase the penetration of a\nnanoparticle into solid tumors and thus increase the local NO release (and other therapeutic drug release), several strategies that have been used to optimize the EPR effect are presented in this review. Usually, nanoparticle accumulation in solid tumors is limited to the perivascular areas, leading to an irregular distribution. For example, surface modification of nanocarriers with enzymes that degrade collagen and hyaluronan is a promising strategy to enhance nanoparticle penetration to tumors.\nIn cancer treatment, NO-releasing nanomaterials should be stable during blood\ncirculation and have high specificity for tumor sites. This leads to enhanced permeation into solid tumors where therapeutic amounts of NO should be locally released. Moreover, the end products of nanoparticles cannot be toxic. Although intense development in this direction has been achieved in recent years, there are still challenges to be overcome in order to finally propose the administration of nanomaterials and NO in clinical settings. The major challenges to be fully overcome are the following: (i) the thermal and photochemical stabilities of the NO-generating nanocarriers for commercial purposes, (ii) the stability of NO-releasing nanomaterial in blood circulation, (iii) an enhanced target delivery platform, (iv) control over NO loading and releasing to the nanocarrier, (v) further investigation of the possible interactions of NO/nanomaterials and traditional chemotherapies, (vi) further investigation of the mechanisms of NO in reversing the MDR effect, (vii) complete evaluation of the fate of the nanomaterial after the NO release in vivo, (viii) the\npossibility of scaling up the synthesis of NO-releasing nanomaterials, (ix) development of economically feasible pathways to produce the nanomaterials, (x) development of robust and reproducible protocols to synthesize NO-releasing nanomaterials, (xi) for applications of NO-releasing nanomaterials allied to traditional chemotherapies in which NO sensitizes cancer cells, the complex crosstalk among NO, ROS, and chemotherapy or ionizing radiation should be further investigated so that the synergistic effects can be further improved, (xii) complete investigation of the amount of NO released directly inside the tumors, because the concentration of NO is critical for the biological effects and most of the reports measure NO release in vitro not in vivo.\nFrom the recent literature, undoubtedly innovative NO-based cancer\ntherapies allied to nanomaterials may facilitate the development of anticancer strategies. We hope that this review opens new avenues in this exciting and promising field."

NO can have a direct toxic effect on tumors, or it can sensitize cancer cells and contribute to the reversal of multidrug resistance (MDR). As NO is a gas and free radical, NO donors have been investigated for their anticancer effects. In recent years, the combination of NO donors with nanomaterials has been emerging as a promising strategy to promote spatial-temporal NO release/generation directly at the target site of application (tumor tissue). Smart nanocarriers that are able to release NO under controlled stimuli have been extensively developed. Moreover, important publications have demonstrated the promising applications of NO-releasing nanomaterials in combination with traditional chemotherapies in which NO can sensitize cancer cells. In this direction, this review presents and discusses the recent progress in the design of versatile nanocarriers that are able to release/generate therapeutic amounts of NO and which can be combined with conventional anticancer therapies. These nanocarriers have the ability to release NO ondemand by external stimuli such as pH, wave, or light exposure. In addition, the possible mechanisms of NO in sensitizing tumor tissue and the impact and challenges of nanomaterials in cancer treatment are also presented and discussed. The biological and pharmacological aspects of NO donors in cancer are discussed. Finally, challenges and perspectives in the development of versatile nanoplatforms to efficiently deliver NO in clinical cancer treatment are highlighted.",
