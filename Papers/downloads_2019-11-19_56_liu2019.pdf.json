      "text" : "The film-forming properties of xylan were affected by its short molecular chain, low molecular weight, high glass transition temperature, and low solubility inwater [1,2]. However, intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding can be formed between hydroxyl groups of xylan during the film formation process. Hydroxyl groups in the xylan molecule can also act as reactive sites with other polymers (chitosan, cellulose, lignin, and PVA), which expands the potential application of xylan in film materials. Chitosan/xylan composite films were prepared by immersion of a chitosan film in the xylan solution [3]. Introduction of xylan into chitosan films resulted in a higher crystallinity and a more compact structure, and greatly improved the tensile strength, breaking elongation and antiultraviolet performance of chitosan/xylan films. Goksu and his co-workers [4] studied the effects of cotton xylan on the performance of lignin/xylan composite films. Results showed that the elongation at break (45% to 57%) and the flexibility of the compositefilmwere significantly improved, and theWVP (water vapor permeability) value was reduced. Gao and his co-workers [5] studied the effects of 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) on the properties of PVA/xylan composite films. The elongation at break and tensile strength of composite films reached maxima of 92.4% and 22.4MPa, respectively, when the content of BTCA was 20 w%.\nui@scut.edu.cn (C. Zhang).\nFilmmaterials prepared by combing organic polymers and inorganic particles usually have better properties than those of organic films [6]. Inorganic particles in the composite films can modify the hydrophilic– lipophilic balance and impart unique properties to the composite films [7]. In our previous study, the effects of nano-TiO2 on the performance of PVA/xylan composite films were investigated [8]. Results showed that nano-TiO2 could improve the mechanical strength, moisture impermeability, UV shielding performance and oxygen barrier properties of the composite film.\nZnO is generally recognized as a safematerial. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has confirmed its resistance to foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria [9,10]. As a multifunctional inorganic metal oxide, nano-ZnO has unique properties, such as physical and chemical stability, photocatalytic activity, ultraviolet and infrared absorption, antibacterial ability and non-toxicity [11]. Thus, nano-ZnO has been used in various applications, such as food packaging [10,12,13], cosmetics [14], medicine [15], dye degradation [16], optical devices [17] and biosensors [18]. Various amounts of nanoclay montmorillonite (MMT) and ZnO nanopowders were used to analyze the properties of biodegradable nanocomposites of cationic starch (CS) [19].The water vapor permeability and the UV light transmittance of the nanocomposites reduced after the contents of MMT and ZnO increased, tensile strength (TS) of nanocomposites increased after the incorporation of ZnO and MMT nanoparticles although the elongation at break was diminished. Tapiocastarch/gelatin/nanorod ZnO (ZnO-N) bionanocomposites were prepared via solution casting technique [20]. The tensile strength of thefilmswas increased from14 to 18MPawhereas elongation at breaks\ndecreased from 18 to 8% and oxygen permeability decreased from 151.03 to 91.52 cm3μm/(m2–day) by incorporation of 3.5% ZnO-N into biopolymer matrix. Besides, amorphous nano-SiO2 also has other advantages such as high specific surface area, stability, durability and thermal stability [21,22]. Unlike the carcinogenicity of crystalline SiO2 [23], amorphous SiO2 is a stable and safe food additive that has been widely used in food processing and preservation [24,25]. The effects of nanosilicon dioxide (nano-SiO2) and the ratio of PVA/gelatin (1:1 and 2:1) on the physicochemical and structural properties of gelatin/polyvinyl alcohol composite films were investigated [26]. The results showed that the highest value of tensile strength (18.05 MPa) was found for a PVA/gelatin ratio of 2:1 and 1% nano-SiO2 (P2:G1-1%).\nIn summary, the introduction of nanoparticles could improve the tensile strength of composites films. However, the strength of the composite films in the above references could be further improved by our method. The dispersion of nanoparticles affected the mechanical strength of composite films, the more uniform the dispersion of nanoparticles, the better the effect on the mechanical strength of the composite films. In our previous study [8], the nano-TiO2 could be well dispersed in sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) solution, therefore the SHMP solution was selected as the solvent instead of water in this experiment. Based on the unique properties of nanoparticles and the potential application of nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2 in food packaging and storage, a series of nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2 enhanced PVA/xylan composite films were prepared. The effects of those nanoparticles on the mechanical properties, water vapor and oxygen barrier properties, thermal stability and UV shielding properties were investigated in this paper."

Nano-zinc oxide (ZnO), nano-silica (SiO2) and sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP, 99%) were obtained from Macklin Reagent Company Limited (Shanghai, China). Lithium chloride (LiCl) and potassium nitrate (KNO3) were obtained from Ke Miou reagent Company Limited (Tianjin China).

After cooling down to 80 °C, xylan and glycerol (10%, based on the total weight of PVA and xylan) were added. The effect of glycerol was to improve the compatibility of PVA/xylan. The weight ratio of PVA to xylan was 3. Nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2 (0–4% weight ratio, based on the total weight of PVA and xylan) were dispersed in 50 mL of 0.04% SHMP solution respectively and stirred for 30 min, then sonified for another 30 min under the room temperature. The nano-particle dispersion was gradually dropped into the PVA/xylan solution under stirring. After ultrasonic defoaming treatment, the above mixture was poured onto a PTFE mould and dried in an oven at 40 °C, and the resulting composite films were obtained. All the films were kept at 23 °C with 50% relative humidity (RH) for at least 48 h prior to measurements. The composite films were named Z0, Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4 and S0, S1, S2, S3, S4 according to the dosage of nanoparticles (0–4%). The synthesis process of the composite filmswas proposed in Scheme1.\n2.3. Characterization of composite films\nThe Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectrum of composite films were acquired by Vertex 33 spectrophotometer (Bruker Germany). The powder scraped from dry filmswas dehydrated in an oven at 50 °C before testing, and then was mixed with KBr and pressed into a tablet for the measurement.\nX-ray diffraction of nano-ZnO, nano-SiO2 and PVA/xylan composite films were analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). The angle of diffraction (2θ) was varied from 5 to 80°. The scan step and scan speed were 0.02° and 0.1 s/step.\nThe mechanical properties of composite films, such as tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB), were evaluated using a tensile testing machine (Instron 5565, Boston, MA, USA).\nThe surface and fracture surface morphology of the composite films were investigated using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S3700, Tokyo, Japan). The test was operated in high vacuum mode at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV.\nThe surface roughness of the films was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco DI Nanoscope 3a, New York, NY, USA) with tapping mode at room temperature in air.\nThe water vapor permeability value was measured according to the method described byWang et al. [27].Thewater vapor permeabilitywas calculated by Eq. (1):\nWVP ¼ Δm Lð Þ= A t Δpð Þ ð1Þ\nwhere WVP is water vapor permeability (g·m−1·s−1·Pa−1). Δm/t (g·s−1) is the gain rate of bottle. A (m2) is the exposed area of the films. L (m) is the mean thickness of the film. Δp (Pa) is the difference in partial water vapor pressure between the two sides of film samples.\nThe compositefilmswere cut into 25× 25mm2 samples and dried to constant weight (m0, g). The dried sample was immersed in 50 mL deionized water at room temperature for 24 h. Then the swollen film was\nss of the composite films.\ndried again for 24 h at 50 °C for the final weightm1. Thewater solubility (S) was calculated according to Eq. (2):\nS ¼ m0−m1ð Þ=m0 100% ð2Þ\nThe oxygen permeability OP (cm3·m−2·24 h−1·0.1 MPa−1) was measured at 23 °Cwith RH 50% using a differential pressure gas permeation apparatus (Labthink VAC-V1, Jinan, China). The oxygen pressure was kept at 0.5 MPa. The vacuum degassing was carried out for 8 h prior to the measurement. The test area was 38.46 cm2 (Φ70 mm).\nThe composite film was cut into a 25 × 25 mm2 samples and placed in desiccator (using saturated LiCl solution to maintain a RH of 11%) until reaching a constant weight (m2, g). Then the sample was placed in another desiccator (using saturated KNO3 solution to maintain a RH of 95%) and weighed (mi, g) at regular intervals. Finally, the sample was dried to a constant weight (mc, g). The moisture absorption W was calculated according to Eqs. (3) and (4):\nWc ¼ m2−mcð Þ=mc 100% ð3Þ\nWi ¼ mi−mcð Þ=mc 100% ð4Þ\nwhere Wc is the moisture absorption rate of the initial sample. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of composite films was determined using an OCA40 contact angle system apparatus (Dataphysics, Filderstat, Germany) by measuring the contact angle of a water droplet (5 μL) after landing on the films for 5 s.\nThermal stability was evaluated using a simultaneous thermal analyzer (TGA Q500, TA Instruments, New Castle, USA). The specimen was cut into pieces (between 9 and 11 mg) and then heated from room temperature to 700 °C. The heating rate was kept at 10 °C·min−1, and the nitrogen flow was maintained at 20 mL·min−1.\nThe ultraviolet light shielding performance was evaluated using an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer (Shimadzu UV1800, Tokyo, Japan), which was scanned in the range of 200–900 nm."

The bands at 985 and 884 cm−1 are assigned to the arabinose unit and the β-glucosidic bond respectively [28]. In addition, the characteristic bands of the PVA overlapwith xylan.

The stretching vibration and bending vibration absorption band of Si\\\\O\\\\Si bond is observed at 468 and 802 cm−1 (as shown in Fig. 1b) [30]. However, the O\\\\H stretching band of composite films with nanoparticles was shifted to a high wavenumber of 3428 cm−1, indicating the interaction of hydrogen bonds between nanoparticles and PVA and xylan [31]. The results of FTIR spectra of composite films confirmed that no new functional group had appeared after the addition of nano-ZnO and nanoSiO2, indicating that only physical interaction between the nanoparticles and the film matrix occurs."

The average of crystallite size of nano-ZnO nanoparticles in neat powder was estimated to be 34 nm according to the Debye–Scherrer equation. For composite films (Z0, Z2 and Z4, Fig. 2a), the characteristic diffraction peaks of xylan at a 2θ = 18.8°and of PVA at a 2θ = 19.4° [8] was integrated into a broad diffraction peak at a 2θ = 19.7° after forming the composite film, indicating that the crystalline region of xylan was changed during the formation of film. As expected, the characteristic peaks of nano-ZnO nanoparticles (2θ=32°, 34.7°, 36.5°, 47.9°, 56.9°, 63.2°, 68.3°) appeared in the diffraction pattern of the composite films (Z2 and Z4) owing to the crystal diffraction effect of nano-ZnO. This result also indicated that the original structure of the nano-ZnO remain unaltered in the PVA and xylan matrix. As it was shown, the intensities of the peaks of nano-ZnO were reduced, it showed that the crystalline form of nanoZnO was partly covered by PVA and xylan matrix. Besides, the relative intensities of characteristic peaks of PVA and xylan were decreased, the addition of nano-ZnO also affected the crystallinity of PVA and xylan matrix in the patterns of Z2 and Z4 films [19]. The characteristic peak intensities of nano-ZnO nanoparticles in Z4 film was much higher than that of Z2 film with the increase of nano-ZnO.\nThe broad peak at a 2θ = 21.9° in XRD patterns of nano-SiO2 indicated that nano-SiO2 particles was mainly amorphous (Fig. 2d) [33].\n0, Z2 and Z4 films; (b) S0, S2 and S4 films.\nThus, there was no emerging crystallization peaks of composite films (S0, S2 and S4, Fig. 2b). The characteristic peak intensities of PVA and xylan at 2θ = 19.7° was decreased when nano-SiO2 was added. PVA and xylan are semi-crystalline polymers due to the hydroxyl groups on their side chains. Once the hydroxyl groups interactedwith nanoparticles, the number of hydroxyl groups available for hydrogen bonding was decreased, which led to a low crystallinity [8].\nFig. 3.

The high TS of composite\nfilms. (a) Z0~Z4 films; (b) S0~S4 films.\nfilmswas attributed to the better dispersion of nano-ZnOat a lower dosage (b3%). The high surface energy and large specific surface area of dispersed nanoparticles facilitated the interfacial bonding between nanoparticles and the polymers, which improved the strength of the films [34]. When the dosage of nano-ZnO was above 3%, nanoparticles tended to aggregate to reduce the surface free energy, which led to a decrease in the hydrogen bonding between the polymers and nano-ZnO particles. Thus, the overall strength of composite films was decreased.\nAt low dosage of nano-ZnO, the hydrogen bonding between nanoZnO particles and the polymers prevented the nanoparticles from agglomeration, and less stress concentration was produced. The decrease in flexibility of composite films was due to the less free movement of the polymer chain [35]. At a high dosage, the EAB was increased due to the agglomeration of nano-ZnO particles which decreased the binding force within the polymer matrix and acted as a partial plasticizer. In this case, the free movement of the polymer chain was not interrupted by nano-ZnO particles [36].\nFig. 4.

The TS of composite films increasedwith the increasing dosage of nano-SiO2 and then decreased. It reached a highest value (22.5 MPa) when the dosage of nano-SiO2 was 3%. That was because the interfacial adhesion between nano-SiO2 particles, PVA and xylan led to an increase in the overall mechanical strength of composite films [37]. However, when the dosage of nano-SiO2 was 4%, the TS was slightly decreased owing to the elastic collision between nanoparticles, particle polymerization and phase separation [38]. When the dosage of nano-SiO2 was 1%, the EAB was the largest since the hydrogen bonding between nanoparticles and the polymers overcame the entanglement betweenmacromolecules and enhance themobility of small molecules. However, with the increase of the dosage of nano-SiO2, the EAB was gradually decreased, because a stable network structurewas formed between nano-SiO2 and PVA and xylan.

With the increase of nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2 dosage, the solubility of composite films was increased because the crystallinity of composite films was lowered, leading to a higher moisture adsorption capacity [39]. Moreover, at a high dosage, the agglomeration of nanoparticles improved the water accessibility [40].\nDue to the tortuous path of water vapor passing through the film caused by nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2 particles, the WVP of composite films was decreased [41]. The water vapor barrier property of the composite films with nano-SiO2 was higher than that of nano-ZnO, since nano-SiO2 had a better dispersion effect than nano-ZnO.

The trend of contact angles indicated that the water absorption tendency of composite films was decreased, that is, they were more hydrophobic. The increase of contact angles was due to a compact structure formed between nanoparticles and polymermatrix.

The weight loss below 135 °C was mainly due to water evaporation of the composite films [47]. The thermal decomposition of small molecules such as glycerol mainly occurred in the range of 135–258 °C. Theweight loss within 258–368 °C was attributed to the degradation of the side chains and main chain of PVA and xylan. The weight loss above 368 °C was owing to the carbonation of the polymers. The terminal temperature of the third and fourth stages was increased. This was because the nanoparticles provided a heat absorption barrier for the polymers, causing a higher degradation temperature. For the composite films with nano-ZnO, at the weight loss of 85%, the temperature of the composite films with nano-ZnO was 490–520 °C, which was 82–112 °C higher than that of PVA/xylan films. The transfer of volatiles generated during the degradation processwould be hindered by the nanoparticles [48], resulting in a decrease in overall degradation efficiency and thus improving the thermal stability.\nThe composite films with nano-SiO2 particles also had better thermal stability than that of PVA/xylan films.

As expected, the light transmittance of the composite films with nano-ZnO particles was slightly decreased at 365 nm because of nano-ZnO's energy gap. The energy gap width was shifted from 376 nm to 365 nm due to the blue shift of UV excitation spectrum of nano-materials [51].

    "abstractText" : "Article history: Received 21 November 2018 Received in revised form 12 March 2019 Accepted 13 March 2019 Available online 14 March 2019 The effects of nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2 on the properties of PVA/xylan composite films were investigated in this work. Results showed that nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2 could effectively improve themechanical strength,moisture and oxygen barrier properties and surface hydrophobic property of the composite films. The results of FTIR and XRD indicated the interaction of hydrogen bonds between nanoparticles and PVA and xylan. When the contents of nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2 in the composite films were 3%, the tensile strength was increased to 20.4 MPa and 22.5 MPa, respectively, while water vapor permeability (3.14 and 3.03 × 10 g·m·s·Pa) and oxygen permeability (5.28 and 5.003 cm·m·24 h·0.1 MPa) reached the minima. With the increase of nanoZnO and nano-SiO2 dosage, the solubility of composite films was increased. When the contents of nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2were 3% and 4%, respectively, the contact angles of the filmswas increased up to 101° and 78°. Besides, the composite filmswith nano-ZnO exhibitedUV shielding performance, whereas the oneswith nano-SiO2 had similar UV light-transparency to the pure PVA/xylan composite films. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
