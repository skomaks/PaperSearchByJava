      "text" : "Transition metal oxides have been attracted by various researcher groups by their promising technological applications such as catalyst, solar cells, batteries, supercapacitors and biomedical applications [1–6]. In the recent past, the development of the advanced functional materials for supercapacitor applications fascinated the researchers as it has the more challenges and opportunities for the usage of metal oxides as an electrode material. Various transition metal oxides were electrochemically tested as a choice of suitable electrode material for supercapacitor applications, due to their various oxidation states for effective charge transfer through redox reactions [7–16]. Metal oxide-based supercapacitors are named as faradaic supercapacitors or pseudocapacitors based on its mechanism for the capacitance behavior [17,18]. The electrode materials working based on pseudocapacitance are of much interest due to the capacitance value from the pseudocapacitors reported in recent times are crossing the capacitance value from carbonbased material which arising through double layer storage mechanism. Even though the high capacitance was achieved using hydrated RuO2 [19], due to its high cost of production several attempts are going on to develop the other inexpensive metal oxides as alternative electrode\nmaterials with improved capacitance value [7–18]. Also, the potential window for the RuO2 is less compared to other metal oxides and limits the use of RuO2 as electrode material in small electronic devices. Further, MnO2 based nanomaterials were studied mostly in various aspects and showed significant improvement with a drawback of material dissolution into electrolyte, which results in lack of stability during long cycling, loss in electronic conductivity and capacitance degradation. Other materials such as Co3O4 and NiO nanomaterials have also attempted to overcome the challenges, but it ends up with low potential window range, which convinced the researchers to pursue the research for an alternative electrode material [20]. It is inevitable to note that the specific capacitance of the negative electrode has not achieved as high as positive electrode [20]. All these challenges with the other metal oxides and opportunities over iron oxide promised the researchers to choose iron oxide as a negative electrode material due to its natural abundance, low cost and facile preparation. The reported theoretical specific capacitance value for Fe3O4 and α-Fe2O3 (2606 and 3625 F/g, respectively) are too large when compared to the present electrode materials [20,21]. It is also reported that the iron oxide-based nanomaterials could work with large potential window. The oxidation states of Fe within iron oxide can be adjusted easily during the sample\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.04.177 Received 4 January 2019; Received in revised form 26 March 2019; Accepted 16 April 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

But the major challenge of using iron oxide in electrochemical applications is the variation in the electronic conductivity with respect to the cation distribution. Fe3O4 showed good electrical conductivity, with one order less than minimum metallic conductivity, of around 2×102 S/m due to the fast electron hoping from the equivalent sites of divalent and trivalent Fe ions within the octahedral sites and these sites are not equivalent in αFe2O3 which results in less electronic conductivity with a confrontation to the charge transfer between the electrolyte and electrode [22–26]. However, few researchers have attempted to make hybrid materials of iron oxides by combining with electro active material like carbon-based material to improve the electrical conductivity as well as the surface area of the hybrid materials [27–29]. Carbon-based material as a component of the electrode material has advantages due to its high conductivity, porosity and surface area which are the primary criteria in electrochemical applications [30–32]. The challenge in the hybrid system is to make a carbon composite with low cost, preparation time and feasibility of the process for large scale preparation. The preparation of carbon materials by using sugar is advantageous over the others due to the easy chemical preparation process, nominal time and lowcost of preparation [33–44]. Zhi-Qiang Hao et al. [45] used waste sugar solution for the preparation of porous carbon spheres as electrical double layer capacitor and showed that the 80% of its capacitance retention even after 5000 cycles. Dong-Wan Cho et al. [46] fabricated a novel magnetic carbon composite by using sugar biomass extracted from sugar cane and showed that it could be a better adsorbent for the methylene blue removal.\nThe advantage of developing hybrid composite materials is that it could enhance the capacitance through a synergistic effect by preventing interparticle agglomeration and the enhancement in specific surface area [20,47,48]. In recent years, researchers developed hybrid materials of iron oxide with carbon-based materials for the enhancement of capacitance and succeeded with significant improvement [33–35]. Wei-Ming Zhang et al. [43] developed hybrid carbon coated Fe3O4 spindles by using glucose as a carbon source and showed that the presence of carbon with Fe3O4 as anode material has improved the electrochemical performance of lithium-ion batteries. Porous Fe3O4/ Carbon core-shell nanorods were developed by Yu-Jin Chen et al. [44] for the electromagnetic wave absorption applications.\nThe presence of the magnetic nanoparticles in a hybrid material is benefitted by the usage of magnetic field to get the response from the magnetic nanoparticles which can be used for the improvement of effective characteristics in the magnetic field assisted applications [49]. The effect of magnetic field in the enhancement of capacitance was reported to be double with an external magnetic field of 0.072 T for Fe2O3-graphene hybrids [50]. Recent report by Shreyasi Pala et al. [51] showed that the capacitance value was increased 1.93 times with the inclusion of external magnetic field of 0.125 T in reduced graphene oxide anchored Fe3O4 hybrid system. By considering the above mentioned various advantageous of iron oxide nanomaterial, we executed the development of the hybrid nanomaterials to serve the purpose of the active electrode material for the super capacitors.\nIn the present work, we have developed novel octahedral shaped Fe3O4 nanoparticles and surface modified Fe3O4 hybrid nanomaterial by using two step chemical processes with post heating process. The octahedral shaped Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared by chemical oxidation method using optimized experimental conditions. The surface modification of octahedral shaped Fe3O4 and α-Fe2O3 with carbon was achieved by dispersing the prepared magnetic nanoparticles into glucose solution and two step heating process. Bare and carbon modified octahedral shaped Fe3O4 and α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles are further investigated for the structural, morphological, magnetic, functional and electrochemical characteristics."

The solution was then heated upto 90 °C while maintaining under continues stirring using a magnetic stirrer. To this solution appropriate amounts of the NaOH and KNO3 were added. The final mixture was kept under constant stirring at 90 °C for 2 h. The collected precipitates were washed several times with double distilled water and magnetic separation was used for the collection of nanoparticles. The collected powder samples were dried by using hot air oven at 90 °C for ~10 h.\n2.2. Carbon modification on Fe3O4\nFor a typical reaction, 1 g of glucose was added with 50ml of double distilled water and then 1 g of chemically prepared Fe3O4 nanoparticles was introduced into this solution. The final mixture was sonicated for 30 mins to attain the uniform dispersion of Fe3O4 nanoparticle into the glucose sugar solution. The final dispersion was stirred and heated to 90 °C to form a colloidal product. Further, the colloidal product was kept in a furnace at 200 °C for 12 h to complete the pyrolysis process. The black colored solid material was collected and grinded using a mortar and pestle to get fine powder. The collected fine black powder was further calcinated at 600 and 800 °C for 2 h under nitrogen atmosphere. The higher calcination temperatures in the preparation process of carbon modification on Fe3O4 resulted as carbon decorated α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles, which is discussed in the later sections. The calcinated products were washed several times with double distilled water and the excess carbon materials was eliminated by magnetic separation. The final products were dried at 80 °C for 4 h and stored. Here after the bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles will be mentioned as F, carbon modified Fe3O4 are named as FCG600 and FCG800 based on the calcination temperature 600 and 800 °C, respectively."

      "text" : "The prepared nanomaterials were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source for crystal phase analysis. The morphologies of the asprepared and carbon modified Fe3O4 nanomaterials were examined by using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) (Carl Zeiss Neon 40) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) (Tecnai F20 FEG TEM with 200 kV accelerating voltage). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained using a Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer (Spectrum RX1). The particle size distribution analysis was done by measuring the particles size by using imageJ software. The magnetic characteristics of the chemically prepared Fe3O4 nanoparticles and carbon modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles were analyzed using a Vibrating Sample magnetometer (VSM) (Model 7404, Lakeshore, USA) at room temperature.\nThe electrochemical measurements for supercapacitor electrode studies were carried out by using CHI760E bipotentiostat (CH Instruments, Inc., USA). All the supercapacitor electrode measurements were carried out in 6M KOH solution. Prior to electrochemical measurements, 10mg of electrode material was mixed in 5mL of stock solution (containing 20mL IPA, 79.6 mL Milli-Q water and 0.4 mL of\nnafion) by sonication for 2 h. For electrode preparation, 5 μl of above mentioned solution was coated on a cleaned glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with an area of 0.0707 cm2 and kept at room temperature for slow evaporation. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in the potential widow of −0.8 to 0.3 V vs Ag/AgCl at various scan rate 5–200mV/s. A platinum (Pt) wire, Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) electrode and Fe3O4 composite coated GCE were used as counter, reference and working electrodes respectively. The specific capacitance was calculated from the galvanostatic charge/discharge at different current densities ranging from 0.5 to 20 A/g in the potential range of −0.1 to 0 V. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of the\nelectrodes were studied with a perturbation of sinusoidal voltage signal of 10mV applied over wide range of frequency between 1MHz to 0.01 Hz with open circuit potential."

      "text" : "Fig. 1(a) shows XRD patterns of Fe3O4 and carbon modified Fe3O4 nanostructures. The XRD pattern depicted that the prepared bare Fe3O4 was of single phase of (JCPDS-82-1533) without any additional peaks related to impurities or secondary phases. The average grain size of the bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles was estimated as 39 nm using the Scherrer's\nequation. After surface modification with carbon using glucose as a source, the average grain size of the FCG600 was estimated as 40 nm. Due to higher calcination step during the carbon modification, the sample FCG800 showed a phase change from Fe3O4 to α-Fe2O3. The average grain size of α-Fe2O3 was estimated as 27 nm. It is noted that the carbon modified magnetic nanoparticles did not showed any carbon related diffraction peaks in FCG600 and FCG800 samples which might be due to the lesser fraction of carbon. This is in accordance with the earlier report about the formation of Fe2O3 from the pure Fe3O4 nanoparticles with a post heating temperature of 500 °C for 15 h [54]. To evaluate the magnetic characteristics of the prepared nanoparticles and the changes with carbon modification, the hysteresis loop of the prepared nanomaterials were analyzed by VSM. The magnetic hysteresis curve of the bare, carbon modified Fe3O4 and α-Fe2O3 are shown in Fig. 1(d–f). The bare Fe3O4 showed a saturation magnetization of 89 emu/g which is near to the bulk saturation magnetization value of\nFe3O4 [55]. The observed saturation magnetization for FCG600 and FCG800\nwere 87 and 29 emu/g, respectively. With carbon modification, the saturation magnetization reduced drastically for the samples prepared at higher calcination temperature (800 °C) and this is due to the phase transformation of Fe3O4 to α-Fe2O3. The changes in the coercivity values are clearly seen from the inset in Fig. 1(d–f). The coercivity values of bare Fe3O4, FCG600 and FCG800 were observed as 130, 124 and 246 Oe, respectively.\nThe estimated saturation magnetization value exhibited a nominal decrease is observed for the FCG600 and the same is drastically lowered for the FCG800 samples when compared with the bare Fe3O4. Whereas the coercivity value is decreased for the FCG600 and further rise in the calcination temperature led to the observation of the higher coercivity value for the FCG800. The reasons are due to (i) the presence of nonmagnetic fraction of carbon material along with the Fe3O4 and (ii) the\nphase transition with post heating treatment which was also evident from the XRD results.\nFig. 1(b) shows the FTIR spectra of bare and carbon modified Fe3O4 nanopowders. All the samples showed characteristics peaks of OeH stretching and H-O-H bending vibrations situated at 3400 and 1600 cm−1, respectively. Despite the fact that the FCG600 and FCG800 samples were prepared at higher temperatures the moisture absorption during the sample handling might be the reason for the observation of these FTIR peaks. The broad peak starting from 2600 to 3650 cm−1\nmight be the overlapping of peaks related OeH stretching and CeH stretching vibrational modes. FCG600 sample showed a peak around 1380 cm−1 which is arising from CeH group and the intensity of this peak for FCG800 was less than that of FCG600, which tells that the fraction of carbon materials in FCG800 would be less compared to FCG600. Other than these, lot of small peaks were observed in the region from 800 to 1800 cm−1 named as finger print region which contains more peaks in lower region. The FTIR spectra recorded in the lower region is showed in Fig. 1(c). In the lower region, the sample showed characteristics metal oxide bonds related peak which arises from Fe and O within the ferrite structure and it is reported as the combination of two vibration modes of metal‑oxygen bond arising from the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the ferrite [56]. The broad band in the range of 500–800 cm−1 is due to the stretching vibration of the metal‑oxygen in tetrahedral sites (ν1) and the small peak in the range of 400–500 cm−1 is assigned to the vibration mode related to the metal‑oxygen in octahedral sites (ν2). There was a splitting observed in the vibration mode arised from the tetrahedral sites, which might be due to the symmetry lowering. Even though the band position of vibrations from octahedral sites for each sample varying slightly, we did not observe any john-teller distortion which could be observed in the splitting of ν2 bands. The force constants kt and k0 were calculated as 1.71 and 0.87×102 N/m for bare Fe3O4, respectively. It is observed that the kt value is decreased in the carbon modified samples and the calculated values are 1.64 and 1.31× 102 N/m for FCG600 and FCG800, respectively. Whereas. the k0 constant values are increased for FCG600 and FCG800 and the calculated values are 0.91 and 1.03×102 N/m, respectively. The kt value for the second small split peak from tetrahedral site for bare Fe3O4 is 1.31× 102 N/m and for FCG600 is 1.30×102 N/ m. The calculated force constant kt and k0 values are merely matching with the available reports. These observations emphasizes that the metal oxide bond strength is decreased for tetrahedral site and the same is increased for octahedral site with the rise in calcination temperature. This is due to the change in the divalent and trivalent ion within the ferrite structure.\nFig. 2 shows the FESEM micrograph of bare and carbon modifed Fe3O4 with their corresponding particle size distribution plots. Interconnected octahedral shaped morphology was observed for bare Fe3O4 with a wide range of size distribution from 30 to 200 nm. The morphology of the iron oxide is also a crucial parameter for any application as the characteristics of the nanomaterials changes with its morphology. Various morphology of iron oxide such as nanorods, nanowires, nanocubes, nanospindles and nanoclusters were developed by using different chemical process with suitable surfactant [57–62]. Few reports showed that the different morphology of Fe3O4 could be prepared without any specific surfactant [43,49,53] and the morphology also can be tuned using the heating rate of the chemical reactions [63,64]. In our case, the octahedral shaped morphology was formed without any specific surfactant and very rarely we could see the octahedral shaped morphology for any materials. Several mechanisms has been discussed for the formation of octahedral shaped particles such as (i) usage of the chloride precursors in the chemical reactions [65,66] (ii) the usage of the surfactant in the chemical reaction [67] and (iii) influence of OH− ions/higher chemical potential [68,69] and (iv) the change in the surface energy during chemical reaction process [70,71]. Here, we have obtained the octahedral shaped nanoparticles without any surfactant due to the thermodynamically favorable experimental\nconditions and also the choice of precursors. The size range was changing with the post calcination temperature. The FESEM image of the FCG600 exhibited smaller sized particles in a small fraction, which is due to the coalescence process happened due to higher calcination temperature. In FCG800 sample, we have observed bigger sized particles as well as smaller sized particles. The octahedral shaped morphology of Fe3O4 was remained undisturbed for FCG 600 but the particle edges become molded for the FCG800 which is the due to the higher calcination temperature. The carbon fraction also observed very less for FCG800 sample when compared with FCG600 as shown in Fig. 2(c). The carbon nanostructures are also observed on the surface of octahedral shaped Fe3O4 nanoparticles for FCG600 and FCG800 samples. The morphological deformation from octahedral nature and the presence of lesser carbon content in FCG800 is due to high temperature used for calcination.\nThe surface area of the prepared hybrid magnetic nanoparticle system is important to understand the suitability these as an electrode material in supercapacitor applications. The effective surface areas of the prepared samples were measured using BET surface area analyzer. The surface area of the bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles was observed as 14.6 m2/g. The enhanced surface area with carbon modification were observed as 53.2 and 51.31m2/g for the sample calcinated at 600 and 800 °C, respectively. Pore size of the samples were measured as 6.3, 8.4 and 9.8 nm for bare Fe3O4, FCG600 and FCG800, respectively. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm curves exhibited the shape of type-II isotherm as shown in Fig. 2(g–i) along with the pore size distribution. To further get a clear visualization of carbon attachment on the octahedral shaped Fe3O4 nanoparticles, we have examined all the particles with TEM microscope.\nFig. 3 shows the TEM micrograph of bare and carbon modified Fe3O4 nanostructures along with their corresponding SAED pattern and intensity translated spectra. As it can be seen that from Fig. 3(a) octahedral shaped particles with various size ranges are observed in bare Fe3O4 which supports the FESEM interpretations. The TEM results (Fig. 3(b–c)) depicted that the carbon modified Fe3O4 clearly depicted that the carbon material attached on to the Fe3O4 particles. The quantitative fraction of carbon material with the magnetic nanoparticles is varied with the calcination temperature. Along with the carbon nanostructure, it is also observed that the octahedral shaped morphology of the magnetic particles was deterioration in shape for some extent in FCG800 sample, which was also observed in FESEM. It is understood that the morphology change happened due to the higher heating temperature which also resulted in the phase transformation of Fe3O4 to α-Fe2O3. The SAED pattern shown in Fig. 3(d–f) revealed the polycrystalline nature of the samples with the characteristic reflections as a ring pattern. The intensity from the SAED pattern could be translated in to a spectrum which can be used to analyze the crystalline nature of the samples as XRD pattern [72]. The intensity of the ring pattern was translated into spectrum using imageJ software and shown in Fig. 3(g–i). As demonstrated in Fig. 3(g–i), the SAED pattern was indexed based on the calculated d-spacing through the diameter of the ring pattern and the intensity translated spectra was indexed based on the characteristic peak position from XRD. From the intensity translated spectra, it is observed the characteristics peaks of Fe3O4 for Bare and FCG600 samples which supported the XRD patterns (Fig. 1a) of the samples. The SAED and intensity translated spectra of FEG800 showed the characteristic reflections of α-Fe2O3. It is also noted that the phase transformation occurred due to higher post heating treatment was also clearly visible in the intensity translated spectra and supports our XRD analysis. The absence of reflection from the carbon material might be due to the less quantity of carbon material compared to Fe3O4 particles. To further investigate the carbon attachment on the Fe3O4 particles, high resolution TEM has been done. The lattice fringes related to octahedral shaped Fe3O4 particles (Fig. 3j) were observed in the HRTEM micrographs. The decoration of carbon material on the Fe3O4 and αFe2O3 is clearly seen from HRTEM micrographs as shown in Fig. 3(k &\nl)."

      "text" : "Fig. 4 shows the cyclic voltammogram curves of bare and carbon\nmodified Fe3O4 nanostructures with different scan rates from 2 to 200mV/s. The distorted rectangular shape of the CV curves signifies the pseudocapacitive behavior of Fe3O4 and its composites. Furthermore, it is observed that the integrated area of CV curves for carbon decorated Fe3O4 is larger than that of the bare Fe3O4, which indicates\nthat the higher electrochemical reaction activity. The comparative CV curve of all the samples for scan rate of 100mV/s is shown in Fig. 6a. The simultaneous contribution from the octahedral shaped Fe3O4 and carbon material resulted for the faradic and electric double layer capacitor process in the carbon modified iron oxide, which are the basic mechanisms behind the energy storage process. The pseudocapacitance reaction mechanism within the Fe3O4 would be the result of oxidation and reduction reactions between Fe2+ and Fe3+ through possible intercalations along with the electrolyte. There is a small reduction peak around 0.1–0.3 V for slow scan rates, which is mainly attributed to the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ in the presence of KOH electrolyte. Further, the Specific capacitance (Cs) of the bare, carbon decorated Fe3O4 and αFe2O3 electrodes are obtained from the CV curves using the equation [14],\n∫ =\n× ∆ × C idV m V v2s (2)\nwhere ∫ idV is the integrated area of CV curves, m is the mass of coated material on the electrode (g), △V is the scanned potential window and v is the scan rate (V/s).\nThe bare Fe3O4 sample showed maximum capacitance value of 188 F/g with the scan rate of 2mV/s. For the same scan rate, the calculated specific capacitance values of FCG600 (323 F/g) and FCG800 (300 F/g) exhibited an enhancement of 72 and 60% than that of the bare Fe3O4. FCG800 sample showed 300 F/g which is 60% higher than that of bare Fe3O4 and 7% less than that of FCG600. The enhancement in capacitance values is due to the Electrostatic double-layer capacitor (EDLC) process raised from the carbon attachment with Fe3O4 nanostructures. Further, FCG800 sample exhibited less capacitance compared to FCG600, which might be attributed to the lesser carbon fraction and as well as the variation in the Fe3+/Fe2+ which was resulted from the\npost heating process at elevated temperature. As obviously can be seen in Fig. 4d, the capacitance of the all samples decreased with increasing the scan rate, which is related to the internal resistance of the electrode and limitation of charge transfer kinetics.\nFig. 5 shows the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of the prepared materials for different current density from 0.5 to 20 A/g. Triangular shape of the linear charge/discharge time confirms the perfect capacitive nature of the bare and carbon modified iron oxide samples in the potential range of −1 to 0 V. The discharge time decreases with the increasing current density, which is due to the variation in the kinetics of oxidation and reduction reactions to keep pace with the fast potential. The nonlinearity of charge/discharge time was observed in our GCD experiments. The GCD curve at low charge current density exhibits a longer discharge time compared to the charging time. In general, high specific capacitance obtained at the lower current density is due to the migration of a large number of ions into the porous structure in the electrode [73,74]. It is believed that, the charge stored in the pores of Fe3O4 nanostructures decelerates the terminal voltage drop. Hence, it requires a longer time to drop the potential from 0 to −1 V. In addition to this F. Barzegar et al reported that presence of oxygen in the electrode materials can promote faradaic reaction, followed by enhancement in discharging time [75]. A comparative GCD curve of all samples at a current density of 2.5 A/g is shown in Fig. 6(b).\nThe specific capacitance (F/g) of prepared sample is estimated from the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves by using the relation [29],\n= × × ∆ C I t m Vs (3)\nwhere I (Amp) is the current applied to the electrode, t is discharging time (s), m is the mass of active electrode material (g) and ΔV is potential window. The specific capacitance of Fe3O4, FCG600 and FCG800 with different current densities is shown in Fig. 5d and the specific capacitance is gradually decreasing with increasing current density. The reduction of specific capacitance with the increase of the current densities is mainly due to the incremental IR drop and insufficient active material involved in redox reactions at higher current densities. The maximum specific capacitance of 274 F/g was achieved for the FCG600 samples with a current density of 0.5 A/g comparing with less specific capacitance of 148 and 194 F/g obtained for the bare Fe3O4 and FCG800, respectively. This is due to the synergistic effect of carbon material and the active Fe2+/F3+ sites in the iron oxide, which enhances the specific capacitance through EDLC and faradic process. The specific capacitance of FCG600 was reduced to 125 F/g with higher current density of 20 A/g which is nearly 54% less than that of the capacitance observed at 0.5 A/g. The reduction with higher current\ndensity was estimated to be 73 and 60% in the bare Fe3O4 and FCG800 samples.\nFew reports suggested that the morphology also playing an important role in the capacitive behavior of the nanomaterials and to the best of our knowledge there is no reports available for the supercapacitor electrode material with octahedral shaped morphology of Fe3O4. For comparison, the electrochemical parameters and the specific capacitance of Fe3O4 with different morphology are tabulated (Table 1).\nFig. 7 shows the electrochemical impedance spectra of Fe3O4 and carbon modified composites. The Nyquist plots can be divided into two parts: (i) a high frequency component with arc and (ii) a sloping straight line in a low frequency range. The corresponding equivalent circuit for impedance analysis is shown inset Fig. 7a, which consists of a series and parallel combination of resistances such as ionic resistance contribution of electrolyte (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) along with the double layer capacitor (Cdl) and Warburg impedance (W). It is observed that Rct value of FCG600 is about 30Ω, which is lesser than that of as prepared Fe3O4 (58Ω) and FCG800 (37Ω), respectively. This reduction in charge transfer resistance is mainly due to the influence of carbon layer on the electronic conductivity of Fe3O4 through charge-transfer interaction. The straight line in the low frequency range is associated with the diffusion process of electrolyte and electrode interfaces. Fig. 7a shows a more vertical nature of FCG600 compared to as prepared Fe3O4 and FCG800 which suggests a better capacitive behavior. To further investigate the durability of the supercapacitor electrode, all the samples were introduced for cycling performance at 5 A/g of current density (Fig. 7b). The specific capacitance retains 83% of its initial value even after 5000 cycles for bare and carbon modified Fe3O4 electrode materials, which strongly signifies the excellent electrochemical stability of the prepared materials. The observed cyclic stability of the prepared samples is higher than that of octadecahedron Fe3O4 this films and Fe3O4/Activated carbon [78,86]. Thus, it is strongly evident that the presence of the carbon material on the octahedral shaped Fe3O4 led to improved stability even after numerous rapid oxidation and reduction reactions during GCD cycling."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusion",
      "text" : "Octahedral shaped Fe3O4 nanoparticles were successfully prepared by adopting simple chemical oxidation method without the use of any additional surfactant. The carbon modification was done with sugar solution with a post heating treatment at 600 and 800 °C under nitrogen atmosphere led to the prominent decoration of the carbon on the Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The octahedral morphology was depicted by FESEM\nmicrographs and the carbon attachment on the Fe3O4 nanoparticles was confirmed by HRTEM micrographs. The phase transformation of Fe3O4 to α-Fe2O3 observed for the samples that annealed at higher temperature was confirmed by the XRD, SAED and SAED intensity translated spectra analyses. The saturation magnetization of bare Fe3O4 was measured as 89 and with carbon modification it was reduced to 87 emu/g. By using bare and carbon modified octahedral shaped Fe3O4 as a negative electrode material for the supercapacitor application, a high specific capacitance of 274 F/g was observed for carbon modified octahedral shaped Fe3O4 nanostructures. The enhanced specific capacitance value is due to the fraction of carbon in hybrid material and it could be enhanced further by increasing the carbon fraction. The capacitance retention was tested with cyclic stability test and the carbon modified Fe3O4 showed 83% even after 5000 cycles. From the structural, magnetic and electrochemical studies, it is manifested that the prepared carbon modified Fe3O4 is a better choice for the negative electrode material. Further, tuning the morphology shape, size and the fraction of carbon attachment would help to improve the specific capacitance and the stability of the electrode materials."

The prepared magnetic nanoparticles were surface modified with carbon using sugar solution as a carbon source. The crystallinity, structural and morphological studies through XRD, FESEM and TEM analysis confirmed the successful formation of the desired nanostructures. The obtained carbon modified octahedral shaped Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibited a larger saturation magnetization of 87 emu/g. Further, the carbon modified magnetic hybrid nanoparticles were exploited as a negative electrode material for supercapacitor application and observed a high specific capacitance value of 274 F/g for the post annealed samples. The enhanced specific capacitance value is due to the fraction of carbon in hybrid material and it could be enhanced further by increasing the carbon fraction. The cycle stability performance was tested with 5 A/g and showed 83% retention even after",
