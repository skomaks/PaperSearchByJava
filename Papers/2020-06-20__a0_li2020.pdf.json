      "text" : "With the growing application of single enantiomer drugs for treating humans and livestock, to ensure security, effective monitoring techniques for chiral drug residue are required\n[1]. Chirality in small molecules is typically caused by the presence of an asymmetric carbon atom [2]. Therefore, conventional determination methods are typically unsuitable owing to the nearly identical chemical structures of enantiomers and image jamming. How to effectively eliminate the interference of enantiomers is one of the important challenges of chiral drug residue determination. Although some methodologies are available for chiral molecule determination, such as chiral chromatography [3] and capillary methods [4], these approaches are often ineffective with low sensitivity and specificity of recognition efficiency. Therefore, there is an urgent necessity to develop simple and effective methods for sensitive and selective testing of chiral drugs.\nLevodopa (L-DOPA), a commonly used medication for Parkinson’s disease, is also commonly used in veterinary medicine [5]. L-DOPA has an enantiomer, D-DOPA [6], which owing to its very similar structure can severely interfere in the determination of L-DOPA. Numerous analytical methods have been developed to estimate the concentration of L-DOPA, including electrochemical sensors [7, 8], highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [9], and a\nElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00604-020-04356-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n* Shuhuai Li happylishuhuai@163.com\n* Mingyue Wang hkwmy0815@163.com\n* Jinhui Luo luocatas@21cn.com\n1 Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Quality and Safety for Tropical Fruits and Vegetables, Analysis and Test Center of Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, Haikou 571101, China\n2 College of Chemistry and Bioengineering, Guilin University of Technology, Guilin 541004, China\ncolorimetric biosensor [10]. However, interference by DDOPA has not received much attention and as these methods cannot realise chiral recognition, they are ineffective for analysing a single enantiomer of a chiral drug.\nThe molecular imprinting technique [11] is an effective technique for preparing molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) [12] that feature selective recognition sites for a specific molecular compound. Recently, this technique has been studied and applied in many fields because of its ability to provide efficient molecular recognition. MIP display unique advantages such as excellent selectivity, physical stability and chemical stability, which makes them useful as chromatographic stationary phases in chiral chromatography [13, 14]. Although MIPs combined with capillary separation technology can be applied for effective chiral separation, the recognition sites of MIPs alone cannot be applied for chiral molecule detection because enantiomer dissociation is inefficient. Although MIP-based determination methods have been reported for L-DOPA [15], L-phenylalanine [16], and Ltyrosine [17], image jamming is inevitable using these methods. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce other recognition elements to meet the requirements for chiral determination. Supramolecular recognition is a chiral molecular recognition technique that relies on weak interactions between molecules [18] via the formation of host–guest complexes [19]. In comparison with traditional host compounds such as crown ethers [20], cyclodextrins [21], and porphyrins [22], calixarenes [23] have a number of advantages, such as an adjustable cavity size, ease of modification, good specificity and stability. The enhancement of chromatographic separation selectivity based on supramolecular recognition by calixarenes has been successful achieved [24]. However, enantiomer interference is also a serious challenge when using supramolecular recognition to detect a single enantiomer.\nIn this work, a novel chiral MIP-based fluorescent nanoprobe based on a dual recognition strategy was fabricated, as shown in Fig. 1. First, a C-dots/Ir/Au fluorescent nanoparticle probe was synthesised by a hydrothermal method. Then, a thiolated calix[6]arenewas grafted onto the C-dots/Ir/Au via the self-assembly of Au–S bonds. Subsequently, using L-DOPA as a chiral template molecule, a host–guest complex was formed between L-DOPA and thiolated calix[6]arene. Then, an MIP was prepared on the C-dots/Ir/Au surface by noumenon polymerisation to form a highly selective binding medium for LDOPA. After the removal of L-DOPA from the MIP, double recognition imprinting cavities were formed. This chiral MIPbased fluorescent nanoprobe was revealed to exhibit enhanced selectivity for L-DOPA owing to the cavity identification effect of thiolated calix[6]arene combined with the specific recognition of the MIP. Furthermore, as the strong fluorescence signal of C-dots/Ir/Au was effectively quenched by L-DOPA, this system can be used to establish an effective method for LDOPA determination. Notably, D-DOPA did not interfere with\nthe determination of L-DOPA, which indicates that the developed nanoprobe successfully achieved chiral recognition of a chiral drug."

      "heading" : "MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au characterization",
      "text" : "The MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au nanoparticles were characterised by TEM, particle size distribution analysis, XRD, UV-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, XPS and ICP-AES. As shown by the TEM image in Fig. 2a, the MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au nanoparticles are spherical and well dispersed, and are in core-\nshell structure. The nanostructures are inferred to be a core-shell structure, where C-dots as the core and the shell’s shadow are faintly visible in the TEM. The mechanism of formation of this structure may be as follows: the functional groups on the surface of C-dots provide anchor sites for the nucleation and growth of Au and Ir nanoparticles. Au3+ and Ir3+ were fixed to the on the surface of C-dots through electrostatic action or coordinate bonds. And then, Au3+ and Ir3+ further reduced to atoms; as the atoms accumulate, Au and Ir nanoparticles were in situ generated on the surface of C-dots [26, 27]. The reaction process is shown in Fig. S4. Most particles having sizes in the range of 10–70 nm (Fig. 2b) and comprise fine uniform spherical particles with a narrow size distribution and good dispersion, without hard aggregates (Table S1 in ESM). Figure 2c shows XRD pattern for MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au. The inconspicuous peak at 25.8° is attributed to the C-dots [28]. The diffraction peaks at 37.8°, 43.0°, 62.8° and 76.0° correspond to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes, respectively, of the Au lattice [29], whereas the diffraction peaks at 40.5°, 47.8° and 69.2° correspond to the (111), (200) and (220) planes, respectively, of the Ir lattice [30]. These results indicate that Ir and Au on the surface of C-dots have good crystallinity. The UV-visible spectrum exhibits an absorption maximum at 358 nm (curve a), and the emission maximum wavelength at 480 nm (curve b in Fig. 2d). The XPS spectrum in Fig. 2e shows the element composition of MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au. C(1s) at 285 eV, N(1s) at 401.08 eV and O(1s) at 534 eV (curve a) belong to C-dots andMIP clearly\nvisible in the spectrum. Moreover, the XPS spectrum in Fig. 2f reveals that intense peaks corresponding to Au(4f2/5) at 84.08 eV and Au(4f2/7) at 87.08 eV are the characteristic peaks for zero valence state of Au [31]. And the intense peak corresponding to Ir(4f) at 64.08 eV is the characteristic peak for zero valence state of Ir [32]. The contents of metallic elements in MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au are determined by AAS. The mass fractions of Au and Ir are 23.4% and 22.8%, respectively. These results indicate that MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au have been synthesised successfully.\nMoreover, the pore volume and specific surface area of the nanoparticles were measured. The specific surface area was 285.8 m2 g−1. After the target molecules were removed from the MIP, cavities formed, and the total pore volume was 0.32 cm g−1.\nSorption isotherm and absorption kinetics of MIP/Cdots/Ir/Au\nTo verify the adsorption characteristics of MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au, the static adsorption method was used for adsorption experiments. As shown in Fig. 3, the adsorption quantities of both MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au and NIP/C-dots/Ir/Au increased gradually with the increase in L-DOPA concentration. However, the adsorption quantities of MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au (QMIP = 31.51 mg g−1) were considerably larger than that NIP/Cdots/Ir/Au (QNIP = 4.01 mg g −1), mainly because the MIP\na b c\nd e f\nhas three-dimensional cavities that are complementary in size and shape to the L-DOPA molecules. Furthermore, the inner surface of the cavity contains functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions with L-DOPA, thus enhancing the adsorption of L-DOPA. Moreover, calix[6]arene in MIP provides more recognition site for LDOPA, via formation of hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group in L-DOPA and phenolic hydroxy group in calix[6]arene. However, the adsorption of L-DOPA on NIP/ C-dots/Ir/Au depends only on physical adsorption, resulting in poor adsorption ability.\nThe results showed that the MIP promoted the specific adsorption of L-DOPA. Further, the Scatchard equation [33] was applied to quantify the binding affinity, as shown in Sect. S7 and Fig. S5 of ESM. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the binding sites (Kd) and the maximum binding amount values (Qmax) were calculated from these linear equations and the Scatchard equation, giving Kd = 9.6 × 10\n−4 mg mL−1 and Qmax = 10.7 mg g\n−1 for the high-affinity binding sites, and, Kd = 4.3 × 10 −4 mg mL−1 and Qmax = 6.85 mg g −1 for the low-affinity binding sites. oThe adsorption kinetics of MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au was studied. As shown in Fig. S6, for MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au, a high adsorption speed was observed in the first 10 min, with a continual increase of the adsorption capacity. Subsequently, absorption equilibrium was reached. In contrast, for NIP/C-dots/Ir/Au, both the adsorption speed and adsorption capacity were low, with absorption equilibrium reached in the first 15 min."

      "text" : "The fluorescence response of MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au is shown in Fig. 4. The fluorescence intensity of C-dots/Ir/Au was strong (curve a), but after binding of L-DOPA and introduction of the dense layer of MIP onto the surface of C-\ndots/Ir/Au, the fluorescence intensity decreased remarkably (curve b). After L-DOPA was removed from the MIP, the fluorescence intensity was restored (curve c). However, following the adsorption of L-DOPA by MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au, the fluorescence intensity was again quenched. These results indicate that L-DOPA can effectively quench the fluorescence of MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au. The experimental results show that L-DOPA can effective quenching the fluorescence intensity of MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au. Both the fluorescence quenching of MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au and NIP/C-dots/Ir/Au follows the equation of Stern-Volmer: I0/I = 1 + Ksv[c] [34] (where I0 and I are the fluorescence intensity of MIP/Cdots/Ir/Au when the template was absence and presence, respectively; c is concentration of quencher; Ksv is quenching constant). The mechanism is divided into three types: static quenching, dynamic quenching and both static and dynamic quenching. According to the experimental steps, I and I0 were detected, the relation between I0/I and c was found. The results indicate that, I0/I was linear with c, as shown in Fig. S7. The linear regression equation was I0/ I = 0.001c + 0.994, with an r of 0.997. So, the quenching process is static or dynamic quenching. Then, the fluorescence lifetime was measured. The fluorescence lifetime of before (τ0) and after (τ1) adding L-DOPA was 5.67 and 5.69, respectively. The value of τ0/τ1 approximately was equal to 1. So, L-DOPA quenching the fluorescence intensity of MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au was static quenching. The Ksv of MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au is calculated as 1.27 × 107 L mol−1, and Ksv of NIP/C-dots/Ir/Au was 0.18 × 107 L mol−1. Hence, an imprinting factor (IF) [35], which was defined as the ratio of KSVMIP/KSVNIP, was used to evaluate the specificity of MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au. Thus, the value of IF was calculated as\n7.1, which indicated that the MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au had specific adsorption toward L-DOPA."

As the amount of L-DOPA adsorbed on MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au increased, the fluorescence intensity decreased. As the minimum fluorescence intensity was obtained after 10 min, the optimum adsorption time was chosen as 10 min (Fig. S8). Moreover, analysis of the optimal pH demonstrated that the efficiency of fluorescence intensity continued to increase as the pH increased, with the highest productivity observed at pH 7.8, as shown in Fig. S8. When the pH value was above 8.0, the efficiency was decreased."

As the L-DOPA concentration increase, the fluorescence intensity of the probe decreased. The decrease in fluorescence intensity (ΔI) showed a linear relationship with the concentration (c) of L-DOPA in the range of 5 × 10−10 to 1.2 × 10−7 mol L−1 (inset, Fig. 5). The linear regression equation wasΔI = 0.35 c + 18.67, with a coefficient of correlation (r) of 0.998. The detection limit was 1.45 × 10−10 mol L−1 (DL = KSb/a, K = 3). Thus, the sensitivity of this method is better than those of the existing methods (Table S2 in ESM). As shown in the Table S2, this method showed higher sensitivity and wider linear range in the trace analysis compared with the\nhighly sensitive electrochemical sensor method. This was because C-dots/Ir/Au has larger specific surface area, better efficiency of electron transfer, higher fluorescence quantum yield and longer lifetime measurement. In addition, MIP/Cdots/Ir/Au combined with specific recognition ability of molecular imprinting technique, the method showed high sensitivity and specificity for L-DOPA determination compared to previous methods."

As shown in Fig. 6, MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au has a large adsorption capacity for L-DOPA owing to the chiral recognition sites in the MIP and thiolated calix[6]arene. However, as MIP/Cdots/Ir/Au only has a small physical adsorption capacity for D-DOPA, D-DOPA will not be recognised by this system. The conventional MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au sample without thiolated calix[6]arene also exhibits an adsorption capacity for L-DOPA owing to the chiral recognition ability of MIP. However, D-DOPA can interfere with the determination of L-DOPA by this sample because the MIP sites offer limited recognition of D-DOPA. Furthermore, as NIP/C-dots/Ir/Au has no effective chiral recognition sites for L-DOPA, the physisorption of D-DOPA and L-DOPA on this sample will be the same.\nTo further study the chiral recognition ability of MIP/Cdots/Ir/Au, the fluorescence intensity was examined after the adsorption of 1.0 × 10−9 mol L−1 L-DOPA in the presence of 1.0 × 10−7 mol L−1 D-DOPA. Results show that the fluorescence intensity of MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au did not change significantly (relative deviation < 5.0%) after L-DOPA was mixed with 100-fold excess D-DOPA. The influence of other interferents in the presence of 1.0 × 10−9 mol L−1 L-DOPA was also examined. The results showed that molecules that are structurally similar or closely related to L-DOPA, such\nas ascorbic acid, trioxypurine, L-tyrosine, epinephrine, endorphins, phenylethylamine, pyrocatechin and amphetamine, at 500-fold the L-DOPA concentration did not affect the fluorescence signals of MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au. Furthermore, many common ions, such as Cl−, NO3 −, SO4 2−, Na+, K+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Al3+ and Ca2+, at 2000-fold the L-DOPA concentration did not affect the fluorescence signals of MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au. These results indicate that MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au acts as a novel chiral recognition probe with an excellent ability to recognise the template molecule L-DOPA. Thus, the combination of thiolated calix[6]arene and MIP provide more recognition sites for chiral recognition, and thus, effectively eliminate enantiomer interference."

The double chiral recognition effect effectively prevented interference by D-DOPA (the enantiomer of L-DOPA) and other common interferents. The method can effectively identify trace target molecules, and by simply replacing the target molecule and synthesising different supramolecular inclusion complexes, we expect that this strategy can expand to realise the selective determination of a wide variety of chiral drugs. But, the adsorption capacity and stability of C-dots/Ir/Au needed further improvement, and the preparation process is relatively complicated.

Cdots/Ir/Au fluorescent nanoparticles, synthesised under hydrothermal conditions, are used as a high-performance probe in combination with a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) and calix[6]arene as a double recognition element. Thiolated calix[6]arene is grafted on C-dots/Ir/Au as the first recognition element, which then forms a host–guest complex with the target molecule levodopa (L-DOPA). Subsequently, an MIP is prepared on the C-dots/Ir/Au (MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au) by chemical polymerisation. After the removal of L-DOPA, double recognition imprinting cavities are formed. The fluorescence intensity at 478 nm of the nanoprobe is effectively quenched by adsorption of L-DOPA on MIP/C-dots/Ir/Au, which provides a method for L-DOPA determination. Owing to the double recognition strategy, this method has excellent selectivity which can effectively avoid interference from enantiomer D-DOPA, and a imprinting factor of 7.1 is obtained for L-DOPA. This accurate and reliable method, with a wide linear range (5 × 10 to 1.2 × 10 mol L) and a low limit of detection (1.45 × 10 mol L), was successfully applied to the determination of L-DOPA in real samples, giving standard recoveries of 89.7–110.0%. Thus, the proposed sensing method provides a viable approach for the determination of a single enantiomer.",
