      "text" : "Mismatch of strength with toughness has usually been the bottleneck for metal matrix composites (MMCs). Generally, the improvement of strength is often accompanied by a significant drop in plasticity. So far, there is still limited effective and universal solution to this problem. Fortunately, nature guides the direction. Shell nacre, made of about 95 vol.% calcium carbonate and 5 vol.% organic polymers, exhibits twice the strength and one thousand times higher toughness than its constituent materials. This excellent performance derives from the special “brick-and-mortar” structure [1]. Nacre’s layered structure constantly changes the direction of crack propagation and increases the energy required for crack propagation [2]. By mimicking this layered structure, aluminum [3], copper [4,5], titanium [6,7], ceramic [8,9] and polymer [10] matrix materials are successfully fabricated with simultaneous enhanced strength and toughness. However, layered structure is usually constructed by flake powder metallurgy [11], chemical vapor deposition [12] and freeze drying [13], and all of these preparation methods are inappropriate for chemically active metal materials, such as Mg.\nAs the lightest structural metal, Mg has high specific strength and specific stiffness. It holds great prospects in automobile, aerospace and\nelectronic communications. However, the hexagonal close-packed structure of Mg results in a limited toughness and plasticity. At room temperature, only the basal slip system {0 0 0 1} 〈1 1 2̄ 0〉 can be activated and cleavage fracture is observed [14]. Therefore, when the strength of Mg alloys increases, the elongation tends to decrease drastically, even less than 5% [15]. By imitating the “brick-and-mortar” structure of nacre, it is possible to balance strength and toughness via constructing micro-nano layered structure.\nCarbon nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) have been widely selected as reinforcements. They are the ideal materials as the “brick” layer due to their ultra-high aspect ratio and mechanical properties. However, poor wettability makes it difficult to uniformly disperse carbon nanomaterials into Mg matrix. The methods for preparing CNTs reinforced Mg matrix composites mainly include stirring casting [16,17] and powder metallurgy [18,19], but these preparation methods are difficult to construct layered structure. Especially, these traditional preparation methods do not make full use of the ultra-high aspect ratio of CNTs, resulting in a limited strengthening effect. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new preparation method suitable for Mg matrix composites to construct micro-nano layered structure.\nA general and effective method to construct CNTs/Mg laminated\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2019.02.006 Received 6 December 2018; Received in revised form 21 January 2019; Accepted 2 February 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

Through EPD, CNTs are homogeneously dispersed on Mg foils and almost no CNTs agglomerates is observed. By regulating the deposition time, the thickness of CNTs layers can be adjusted. Moreover, the layered structural parameters of the composites can be controlled by selecting Mg foils with different thickness. The micro-nano layered structure induces large back stress in the composites and thus achieves ultra- high strengthening efficiency. Besides, the composites represent a significant improvement in toughness. This work not only demonstrates the strengthening and toughening mechanisms of CNTs/Mg laminated composites but also provides a feasible way for conductive matrix, such as aluminum, titanium, copper and even conductive polymers to construct micro-nano layered structure to break through the mismatch between strength and toughness."

After stirring the mixture for 5 h at 70 °C, the slurry was filtered and washed by distilled water and ethanol until the pH reached 7. CNTs with functional groups were dispersed in the mixture of ethanol and acetone (1:1 vol ratio), and then the mixture was ultrasonically vibrated until CNTs dispersed homogeneously. 50 μm pure Mg foils (provided by Beijing Qianyue Nonferrous Metal Products Co., Ltd., China) were treated with nitric acid to remove the Mg oxide from the surface. The fabrication process is shown in Fig. 1. Mg foils were adopted as cathode and stainless steel was adopted as anode. The deposition voltage was 30 V. The content of CNTs was adjusted by the deposition time. These Mg foils deposited with CNTs were stacked layer by layer. The stacked Mg foils were vacuum sintered for 2 h with the pressure of 50MPa. Finally, the composites were rolled at 400 °C. For each pass the reduction of thickness was 10% until a total reduction of 60%. During each pass the composites were annealed at 400 °C for 10min. Pure Mg was prepared by the same procedure."

The dispersion of CNTs and the fracture morphology of composites were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SUPRA 55 SAPPHIRE). The macro fracture morphology was observed by optical microscopy (OM, P-3 Olympus). Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) was used to characterize the microstructures and Schmid factors of the rolled composites on RD-ND planes. The EBSD samples were first mechanically polished and then electro polished within the mixture of phosphoric acid and ethanol (3:5 vol ratio) at room temperature with a current of 0.3 A for 60 s. The volume fraction of CNTs in the composites was characterized by C/S analyzer (LECO CS844). The tensile testing and loading-unloading-reloading testing were performed by using electronic universal testing machine (Instron 5569) with ASTM: E8/E8m-13a standard. The crosshead speed was 1.0mm/min. Dog-bone shaped specimens with gauge length 15mm and width 6mm were used for the tensile testing. The specimens for tensile testing were sectioned by wire-electrode cutting and ground on 2000 mesh SiC abrasive paper with water lubricant. Three samples were tested for each material. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Talos F200s FEI) was used to observe the microstructures of the composites. The specimens for TEM test were mechanically ground to obtain the 50 μm thick sheets, followed by ion beam thinning to obtain the final extremely thin samples."

      "text" : "Fig. 2 shows the morphology of deposited CNTs with different deposition times. For a short deposition time such as 30 s, the CNTs are scattered on the surfaces of the Mg foils and there is no big agglomeration, as shown in Fig. 2a. For a longer deposition time, even if the entire surfaces of Mg foils are covered by CNTs, they are dispersed uniformly. As shown in Fig. 2b and c, there is hardly any big CNTs agglomerate observed. Moreover, the content of CNTs can be regulated by adjusting the time for EPD.\nThe Raman spectra of CNTs is shown in Fig. 3a. The initial functionalized CNTs have the Raman peaks at 1346 cm−1 (D-band) and\n1581 cm−1 (G-band). Generally, the defects of CNTs are characterized by the ratio of ID/IG [20]. The larger the value, the more defects the CNTs have. After rolling, the peak of G-band only has a slightly shift to 1583 cm−1. The value of ID/IG for initial CNTs and CNTs in rolled CNTs/Mg composites are 0.98 and 1.02, respectively, which indicates there is only negligible damage to CNTs after preparation process. Fig. 3b shows the CNTs that penetrate into adjacent Mg as the “connecting bridge”. HRTEM image of the interface between CNTs and Mg matrix is shown in Fig. 3c. There is a good bonding between CNTs and Mg matrix. No micro defect is found around the interface, proving that the preparation method in this work is feasible in fabricating CNTs/Mg composites.\nFig. 4a shows the typical fracture surface of nacre [1]. The OM image of CNTs/Mg composites is shown in Fig. 4b. By alternately stacking calcium carbonate (about 0.4 μm thick) and nano organic polymer layer by layer, the nacre forms a submicron-nano layered structure. By alternately stacking Mg foils (about 50 μm thick) and CNTs layer by layer, the micro-nano layered structure is constructed. After rolling, the thickness of Mg layers in composites is about 20 μm. It is evidently that the microstructure of the laminated composite is very similar to nacre. As shown in Fig. 4c, the SEM image of CNTs/Mg composites indicates there is no defect between two layers. As shown in Fig. 4d, even at the nanoscale, the CNTs are dispersed in a line to form the CNTs layer."

      "heading" : "4.1. Strengthening mechanisms of CNTs/Mg composites",
      "text" : "The strengthening efficiency of the CNTs layers in the laminated CNTs/Mg composites greatly surpass the simple mixture rule. For traditional MMCs, it is commonly believed that the strengthening mechanisms mainly includes the following four parts: grain refinement mechanism ( −σΔ Hall Petch), load transfer from the matrix to reinforcements ( σΔ LT), the increment of the dislocation density generated by the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch ( σΔ CTE) and Orowan strengthening σ(Δ Orowan). As shown in Fig. 4b, almost all CNTs are distributed at the grain boundaries, so Orowan strengthening is negligible.\nHowever, the CNTs layers play an important role for generating high back stress to replace the Orowan strengthening.\n(1) Load transfer from matrix to reinforcements\nCompared with traditional reinforcements, the extremely large aspect ratio of CNTs makes load transfer more efficient. Shear lag model [28] has been widely used to estimate the load transfer mechanism. According to the modified shear lag model, the contribution of load transfer mechanism on the yield strength can be estimated by the following equation [28]:\n=σ σ V Δ S\n4m f LT (4)\nwhere σLT represents the yield strength of composites; σm represents the yield strength of Mg matrix; Vf is the volume fraction of CNTs; S is the aspect ratio of CNTs.\n(2) Dislocations generated by the coefficients of thermal expansion mismatch\nThe values of CTE of Mg and CNTs are × −1 10 6 and × −2.5 10 5, respectively [18]. During the cooling of the composites, the local strain is generated due to the mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficients, resulting in a large amount of geometrically necessary dislocations\n(GNDs) around the interface between CNTs and Mg matrix. The contribution of dislocations generated by thermal expansion mismatch can be calculated by the formula below [18]:\n=σ T αV Δ AGb 12Δ Δ\nbd f CTE G (5)\nwhere A is a constant (1.25); G is the shear modulus of the Mg matrix ( ×1.67 104 MPa); b is the Burgers vector of the Mg matrix ( × −3.21 10 10 m) [28]; TΔ is the difference between the rolling and test temperature; αΔ is the difference between the CTE of Mg matrix and CNTs [29]; Vf is the volume fraction of CNTs.\n(3) Grain refinement mechanism\nAfter hot rolling, the layer spacing between CNTs layers drastically reduce from 50 μm to 20 μm, as shown in Fig. 4c. The high strength CNTs layers effectively limits the growth of grains along the normal direction (ND). However, in order to make the interlayer bonding better, a high rolling temperature of 400 °C was chose which makes the grains growing into strips along the interface between the layers, as shown in Fig. 4b. The growth of grains leads to limited grain refinement. The average grain size of Mg and composites are 25 and 20 μm, respectively. The contribution of grain refinement can be expressed by the following equation [16]:\n= −−\n− − σ d dΔ K( )Hall Petch c 1 2 m 1 2\n(6)\nwhere K is a constant (280MPa·μm1/2 for Mg); dc and dm are the average grain size of composites and Mg, respectively.\nFor traditional homogeneous distributed CNTs reinforced Mg matrix composites, the predicted yield strength can be estimated as:\n= + + + −σ σ σ σ σΔ Δ Δ Δyc ym LT CTE Hall Petch (7)\nwhere σΔ yc and σym are the yield strength of composites and Mg, respectively.\nHowever, the σΔ yc calculated by Eq. (7) is about 30MPa and this value is much smaller than the actual σΔ yc about 50MPa. Therefore, there must be another strengthening mechanism derived from the micro-nano layered structure.\n(4) Back stress hardening mechanism induced by micro-nano layered structure\nBecause the CNTs/Mg composites represent a larger strain hardening rate than Mg, as shown in Fig. 5c, the composites should have higher dislocation density than Mg. Under tensile loading, the soft Mg layers begin plastic deformation first. However, the deformation of Mg layers are constrained by surrounding hard CNTs layers. Dislocations are blocked and stacked around the interfaces between Mg matrix and\nCNTs layers, as shown in Fig. 6. The blocked dislocations and the GNDs around the interfaces generate high layer induced back stress. Since Wu [30] has constructed the micro-nano layered structure and proved that high back stress play an important role in the composites, it is possible the back stress hardening also be an important strengthening mechanism in this work. A series work is carried out to characterize the back stress hardening mechanism in the composites.\nAs shown in Fig. 7a, the loading-unloading-reloading tensile testing is conducted to unveil the back stress hardening mechanism in the composites. The method to estimate back stress has been extensively discussed in the reported works [3,30–32]. The definition of back stress is shown in Fig. 7b. The back stress can be calculated by following equations:\n= −\n+\n∗ σ σ σ σ( ) 2 2eff flow u (8)\n= −σ σ σbs flow eff (9)\nwhere σeff is the effective stress; σu is the unloading yield stress; ∗σ is the thermal part of the flow stress σflow, σbs is the back stress.\nAs shown in Fig. 7c, the CNTs/Mg composites have a much higher back stress than Mg. By constructing the micro-nano structure, the higher back stress has been another important strengthening mechanism for the laminated composites. The predicted yield strength for the laminated composites in this work can be calculated as:\n= + + + +−σ σ σ σ σ σΔ Δ Δ Δ Δyc ym LT CTE Hall Petch bs (10)\nThe contributions of different strengthening mechanisms are shown in Fig. 8a. The result of calculation proves that the back stress generated by the special micro-nano layers can greatly improve the strength of composites. The theoretical improvement of yield strength of homogeneous and layered composites are shown in Fig. 8b. By constructing\nthe micro-nano layers, it is possible to exceed the strength of traditional homogeneous materials."

      "text" : "(1) Increasing the energy required for crack propagation\nThe fractography of the pure Mg and the CNTs/Mg composites are shown in Fig. 9. As a result of the hexagonal close packed structure, Mg always shows a limited plasticity. Obviously, the fracture surface of pure Mg shows a cleavage fracture. As shown in Fig. 9a, there are clearly stream flows and cleavage steps. As shown in Fig. 9b, by embedding CNTs into Mg matrix and constructing the micro-nano layered structure, the fracture morphology of CNTs/Mg composites has a tremendous change from smooth cleavage fracture to rough jagged\nfracture. The CNTs layers act as the high-strength barriers that hinder the crack propagation. As shown in Fig. 9c, there are evident deflected cracks pathway.\nAs the most common toughening mechanisms, “CNTs pull-out”, “crack deflection”, and “CNTs bridging” are ubiquitous in the CNTs/Mg composites, as shown in Fig. 10. During the fracture of the materials, a large amount of CNTs are extracted from the Mg matrix, as shown in Fig. 10a. On the one hand, the CNTs pull-out relax the crack tip stress,\nwhich slows the crack propagation. On the other hand, the CNTs pullout forms some new interfaces and requires external force to do work, thus consuming more energy to propagate the crack. When the CNTs are not pulled out, small bridges are formed on both sides of the crack to connect the two Mg layers, as shown in Fig. 10b. The CNTs bridging produces a compressive stress on the crack surface to counteract the applied stress, making it difficult to further expand the crack and\nincrease the toughness of the composites. Since the fracture mode of pure Mg is brittle fracture, its fracture surface is very smooth, as shown in Fig. 10c. However, evident traces of crack deflection are visible in the composites, as shown in Fig. 10d. The crack deflection greatly extends the path of crack propagation, making more energy consumed before the failure of the composites. The schematic diagram of fracture model of Mg and CNTs/Mg composites are shown in Fig. 11a and b. Upon\nFig. 9. SEM images of Mg and CNTs/Mg composites. (a) Fracture surface of monolithic Mg show the evident cleavage fracture. (b) and (c) Fracture surface of CNTs/ Mg composite show the CNTs layers deflect crack propagation. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\nloading, the strain of pure Mg is localized and soon the material fails with a smooth fracture. As for the CNTs/Mg composites, due to the higher strain hardening rate, the composites deform more uniformly. Besides that, CNTs layers hinder the propagation of cracks, making the direction of cracks propagation constantly deflect. As shown in Fig. 11c, the OM image of the fracture morphology of CNTs/Mg composites also proves the deflected cracks. Therefore, the CNTs layers effectively improve the toughness of composites by increasing the energy required for crack propagation.\n(2) CNTs layers promote dislocation slip\nIt is generally believed that the basal slip of dislocation is the main deformation mechanism for Mg at room temperature. But for rolled Mg, there is always a strong rolling texture that makes it difficult for dislocation slip. Fig. 12a and d show the Schmid factors for the basal slip system {0 0 0 1} 〈1 1 2̄ 0〉 along the rolling direction (RD) of the monolithic Mg. It is obviously that the low Schmid factors make it difficult for Mg to deform at room temperature. Fig. 12b and e show the\nSchmid factors for the basal slip system {0 0 0 1} 〈1 1 2̄ 0〉 along the RD of the CNTs/Mg composites. The Schimd factors of CNTs/Mg composites have a sudden change at about 0.35. This sudden change is derived from the twinning behavior of the composites. As shown in Fig. 12b, c and f, the region A/B and C/D are distinct extension twinning and contraction twinning, respectively. It is the twinning behavior that adjust the grain orientations to a direction more suitable for basal slip of dislocation. This difference between monolithic Mg and composites comes from the CNTs layers. When monolithic Mg is rolled, the grains are unconstrained, so the {0 0 0 1} planes can rotate very easily to the direction perpendicular to the RD. However, CNTs layers have a strong constraint on grains and these grains have to grow into long strips along the RD. The binding effect of CNTs layers makes the grains unable to rotate freely. Then the rolling texture of CNTs/Mg composites is severely weakened, which greatly improve the slipping ability of dislocations. Then the toughness of CNTs/Mg composites is improved.\nAdditionally, reported works have proved that CNTs or GNPs have the ability to induce the prismatic slip of dislocation and improve the ductility of the composites [25,33]. That is another toughening\nmechanism for CNTs/Mg composites."

The strengthening efficiency beyond the traditional homogeneous composites is mainly derived from the high back stress caused by CNTs layers that block the dislocations slip.

By imitating the structure of nacre, constructing micro-nano layered structure is an effective way to balance strength and toughness. The micro-nano layered structure is constructed by electrophoretic depositing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on Mg foils. The CNTs layers embedded into 50 μmMg foils exhibit a strengthening efficiency of 500 while increasing the toughness of the composites. Experiments and theoretical calculation results reveal that the high back stress induced by CNTs layers is an important strengthening mechanism. The significantly improved toughness derives from the increase in energy required for crack propagation and high Schmid factor for the basal slip system {0 0 0 1} 〈1 1 2̄ 0〉. This work provides a feasible and universal way for conductive matrix, such as aluminum, titanium, copper and even conductive polymers to construct micro-nano layered structure to break through the mismatch between strength and toughness.",
