China\nThe ORCID identification number(s) for the author(s) of this article can be found under https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202001526.\nDOI: 10.1002/smll.202001526\nenergy density, long lifetime, and environmentally friendly, owing to its versatile applications in electronic devices, such as mobile phones, intelligent electronics, and electric vehicles.[3,4] However, the modest lithium storage capacity of commercial graphite-based anodes (≈372 mAh g−1) severely limits their further extensive application in high power LIBs.[5,6] Therefore, it is imperative yet meaningful to develop advanced anode materials with satisfactory cycling stability and large reversible capacities to meet the stern need of advanced energy storage devices.[7–9]\nTypically, transitional metal oxides (TMOs) represent a type of promising anode materials for LIBs thanks to their low cost, environmental benignity, large theoretical specific capacity, etc.[10,11] Particularly, Co3O4 has been considered as a classic electrode material due to its remarkable specific capacities.[12] Nevertheless, the application of Co3O4 in LIBs has been seriously hindered as a result of its huge volume change in charge/ discharge processes, low Li+ diffusion kinetics, toxicity, and high cost.[13] Hence,\nenormous attempts have been made to replace elemental Co in Co3O4 partially with even cheaper and environmentally friendly alternative elements (e.g., Zn,[14] Cu,[15] Ni,[16] Mg,[17] and Fe[18]) but without sacrificing electrochemical properties. The coupling of two metal species not only promotes the electrical conductivity, but furnishes the binary TMOs with abundant redox reactions. In particular, the introduction of Zn just renders a controllable change in Co3O4 owing to its invariable bivalent state.[19] Meanwhile, ZnCo2O4 (ZCO) usually exhibits desirable electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity, benefiting from their complex chemical components and synergistic effect with two different metal ions compared with Co3O4.[19–23]\nUp till now, various ZCO materials with distinct nanostructures, including nanoparticles (NPs),[24] nanowires,[25] nanofibers,[26] porous core–shell structure,[27] and porous hollow spheres,[28] have been extensively investigated as electrodes for LIBs. Despite these favorable and enormous advances, the concerns in terms of lithium diffusion kinetics, electronic transport, volume change, and particle agglomeration are still not conquered well in these conventional ZCO materials.[29]\nRecently, binary ZnCo2O4 has drawn enormous attention for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as attractive anode owing to its large theoretical capacity and good environmental benignity. However, the modest electrical conductivity and serious volumetric effect/particle agglomeration over cycling hinder its extensive applications. To address the concerns, herein, a rapid laser-irradiation methodology is firstly devised toward efficient synthesis of oxygen-vacancy abundant nano-ZnCo2O4/porous reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrids as anodes for LIBs. The synergistic contributions from nanodimensional ZnCo2O4 with rich oxygen vacancies and flexible rGO guarantee abundant active sites, fast electron/ion transport, and robust structural stability, and inhibit the agglomeration of nanoscale ZnCo2O4, favoring for superb electrochemical lithium-storage performance. More encouragingly, the optimal L-ZCO@rGO-30 anode exhibits a large reversible capacity of ≈1053 mAh g−1 at 0.05 A g−1, excellent cycling stability (≈746 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 after 250 cycles), and preeminent rate capability (≈686 mAh g−1 at 3.2 A g−1). Further kinetic analysis corroborates that the capacitive-controlled process dominates the involved electrochemical reactions of hybrid anodes. More significantly, this rational design holds the promise of being extended for smart fabrication of other oxygen-vacancy abundant metal oxide/porous rGO hybrids toward advanced LIBs and beyond."

      "text" : "As natural resources continue to be enormously consumed, there is an increasing demand for renewable and sustainable energy in the 21st century.[1,2] In recent years, considerable efforts have been dedicated to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high\nSmall 2020, 2001526\n2001526 (2 of 11)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\nwww.small-journal.com\nTo address the issues, one effective strategy is to anchor nanoscaled ZCO onto electrically conductive carbonaceous matrices toward constructing nanohybrids, which will guarantee the benefits from synergistic effect.[30–32] Typically, flexible reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO NSs), as a 2D physical buffer, can accommodate serious volume expansion, prevent agglomeration of electroactive ZCO over continuous lithiation/ delithiation cycles, and meanwhile, improve electrical conductivity of the hybrids.[33,34] Furthermore, it would be even better if many mesopores were purposefully engineered in the rGO NSs, which can constitute highly continuous open channels throughout the whole hybrid electrodes for rapid transport of electrolyte ions without the degradation of electronic transport rate.[35] Besides this, it is of equal significance as well to explore several effective yet simple avenues to enhance electronic conductivity of the ZCO itself, as a complementary approach toward favorable lithium-storage properties. Unfortunately, the strategies to obtain ZCO-based hybrid anodes are commonly time- and/or energy-consuming since multi-step reactions are normally involved,[22,23,27,33,34] and even in some cases, complicated procedures are especially requisite.[11,27] Thus, from the perspective of widespread and practical applicability, it is always an enormous challenge to achieve advanced ZCO-rGO hybrid anodes with the appealing structural feature, as mentioned above, by exploiting more efficient and environment-friendly methodologies.\nRecently, reasonable creation of oxygen vacancies has been investigated to augment the electrical conductivity and electrochemical activities of TMOs.[6,8,12,36,37] The oxygen vacancies can not only remarkably accelerate lithium-ion diffusion and charge transfer, but furnish more active sites, thus enhancing their electrochemical lithium-storage performance. However, due to the limitations of the common strategies for introducing oxygen vacancies (e.g., heteroatom doping, chemical reduction),[6,8,12] TMOs with rich oxygen vacancies, especially for binary TMOs/ rGO hybrids, have been scarcely synthesized. Accordingly, an innovative strategy is highly necessary for developing unique binary ZCO/rGO hybrids, where abundant oxygen vacancies in electroactive ZCO are created.\nWith the comprehensive considerations above in mind, herein, we first put forward an efficient laser-irradiationinduced synthesis strategy to rapidly fabricate oxygenvacancy abundant nano-ZnCo2O4/porous rGO hybrids toward LIBs as competitive anodes. Attractively, the one-step laser\nirradiation, as “one stone,” kills three birds in half an hour, i.e., simultaneously introducing rich oxygen vacancies into the resultant ZCO NPs and creating mesopores in rGO NSs. When evaluated as promising anodes for LIBs, the resulted laser-induced oxygen-vacancy abundant nano-ZCO/porous rGO (labeled as L-ZCO@rGO) hybrids were endowed with exceptional electrochemical properties in terms of high-rate reversible capacities and long-duration cycling stability, benefiting from synergistic advantages of both two components in the hybrids, including superb electron/ion transport and robust structural stability. Furthermore, the optimal L-ZCO@rGO anode-based full device displayed exceptional electrochemical properties."

      "text" : "In this work, the L-ZCO@rGO hybrids, as schematically demonstrated in Figure  1, are prepared through simply irradiating the suspension with the GO and ZCO NSs by laser. The as-obtained ZCO NSs, as observed in Figure 2a, present a typical 2D architecture with a thickness of ≈30  nm, which comprises numerous well-crystalline NPs of ≈20  nm in size (Figure  2b,c). During the pulsed laser irradiation, the ZCO NSs can be crushed into NPs by the laser-induced fragmentation effect,[38–40] and meanwhile the resultant L-ZCO NPs will be striked by the laser-induced protons from the water as well, rendering abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of L-ZCO NPs (Figure 1). Besides this, the laser-induced electrons from the water will promote the reduction of GO into the rGO NSs, along with the creation of mesopores in the NSs, properly resulting from the electronic attack and local photothermal effect.[41,42]\nAfter laser irradiation for 30 min and further vacuum freezedrying, the hybrid, designed as L-ZCO@rGO-30, is obtained. Clearly, the ZCO NSs are broken into NPs with a size of about 20–50 nm, which are coupled well with the flexible rGO NSs, as evidenced from field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) examination (Figure 2d). Furthermore, the huge gap between L-ZCO NPs and discernable wrinkles of rGO, as marked by the red dotted line in Figure 2e, can effectively prevent serious agglomeration of resultant NPs and corresponding\nSmall 2020, 2001526\n2001526 (3 of 11)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

KGaA, Weinheim\nwww.small-journal.com\nvolume expansion over lithiation. Figure  2f,g shows the low-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 specimen. Besides the NPs of ≈20–50  nm in size located on the rGO surface, similar to the FESEM visualizations, the brighter contrast apparently confirms the existence of mesopores of ≈20 nm in diameter in the rGO NSs, as highlighted by the red circles. Further close-up view (Figure 2h) visualizes that a slight fusion occurs between the NPs due to the pulsed laser irradiation, which results in larger-sized NPs. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure  2i) manifests the well-defined lattice fringes with a spacing of ≈0.47 nm, corresponding to the interplanar distance of (111) crystalline plane of the ZCO. Typical selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 2j) displays a series of concentric rings, which match well with (111), (220), (311), (400), (511), and (400) planes of the ZCO phase, indicative of the polycrystalline characteristics of the L-ZCO NPs. Interestingly, with the absence of GO, i.e., in the case of the L-ZCO NSs, typcial NS architecture cannot be entirely crushed into NPs after 30 min laser irradiation, and lots of molten particles with even larger size are distributed on the surface of the NSs (see Figure S1a in the Supporting Information). It suggests that the existence of GO NSs can efficiently restrain the re-aggregation of ZCO NPs over the laser irradiation. While, with the irradiation time being reduced to 20  min, the ZCO NSs are not completely broken into NPs as well, and a large number of agglomerated particles are simply mixed with the rGO NSs in the hybrid (marked as L-ZCO@rGO-20; Figure S1b, Supporting Information). Although the L-ZCO NPs are distributed well upon the rGO with the irradiation time being prolonged to 40 min, the serious laser melting takes place, leading to the larger-size L-ZCO NPs (≈100  nm) in the hybrid (denoted as L-ZCO@rGO-40; Figure S1c, Supporting Information). Therefore, the irradiation time enormously influences specific micro-structures of the final L-ZCO@rGO hybrids, which thus results in their distinct Li-storage properties. Figure  3a shows the representative X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the ZCO NSs, L-ZCO NSs, and L-ZCO@rGO-30. The discernable diffraction reflections of the three samples are basically the same. All the diffractions can be indexed perfectly as the cubic ZnCo2O4 (JCPDS card No. 23-1390) with a space group of Fd-3m(227), which reveals that the introduction of rGO and pulsed laser irradiation do not alter the crystal phase of the obtained products at all. However, the signals for the rGO in the hybrid cannot be detected in Figure 3a. To further verify the existence of rGO, Raman testing was conducted as shown in Figure  3b. The characteristic D and G bands located at ≈1356 and ≈1586 cm−1, originating from the rGO, are observed in Raman spectrum of the L-ZCO@rGO-30.[43,44] The ID/IG value is estimated as ≈0.96 for the L-ZCO@rGO-30, larger than that of the pristine GO (≈0.88), which should result from a high proportion of lattice defects induced in the porous rGO by laser irradiation.[45] The specific content of rGO in the L-ZCO@ rGO-30 is calculated as ≈24 wt% via the thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Figure S2, Supporting Information). As for the Raman spectrum of L-ZCO NSs (Figure 3b), three characteristic peaks centered at ≈480, ≈519, and ≈685 cm−1 are ascribed to the Eg, F2g, and A1g modes of the spinel ZCO, respectively.[46,47] By contrast, these peaks of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 shift left to ≈477, ≈517, and ≈679 cm−1, compared to those of the L-ZCO NSs, confirming the coupling effect between L-ZCO NPs and porous rGO.[48] In order to probe specific chemical states of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 hybrid, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted accordingly. The survey spectrum of L-ZCO@rGO-30 (Figure S3a, Supporting Information) testifies the co-existence of C, O, Zn, and Co elements. In the deconvoluted high-resolution C 1s spectrum (Figure S3b, Supporting Information), three peaks at ≈284.4, ≈285.8, and\nSmall 2020, 2001526\n2001526 (5 of 11)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\nwww.small-journal.com\n≈288.3  eV are showed, which are related to the CC/CC, CO, and CO functional groups, respectively. Notably, the existence of CO and CO functional groups, as active sites, can immobilize the formed L-ZCO NPs.[49] As for the Zn 2p spectrum (Figure  3c), the peaks centered at ≈1021.3 and ≈1044.3 eV correspond to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, indicating the Zn(II) in the L-ZCO@rGO-30. Interestingly, the two peaks both positively shift when compared with the ZCO NSs, suggesting that the Zn species in the L-ZCO@rGO-30 are more electropositive, which may be attributed to the bond distortion between ZnCoO atoms in the oxygenvacancy abundant nano-ZnCo2O4, accompanying with the redistribution of electron density.[50–52] In the high-resolution Co 2p spectra (Figure  3d), two peaks centered at ≈779.9 and ≈794.9 eV are attributed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of the Co3+, along with the satellite (sat.) peaks at ≈789.9 and ≈804.8  eV, and other two peaks at ≈781.1 and ≈796.1 eV are ascribed to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of Co2+, respectively. The Co2+ accounts for about 45.1 at% of total Co atoms in the L-ZCO@rGO-30 according to the integrated peak area,[53–56] which is larger than that in the ZCO NSs (≈29.3 at%). The distinct differences in Zn/Co 2p peaks here reveal more oxygen vacancies in the L-ZCO@rGO-30 product, resulting from the pulsed laser irradiation, which can be further supported well by the O 1s spectra of the two samples (Figure  3e). Obviously, two fitted peaks are characteristically present. Specifically, the one (O1) at ≈531.9  eV is assigned to the oxygen vacancy, and the other at 530.0 eV is attributed to metal–oxygen bond.[54] The atomic proportion of oxygen vacancies is estimated as ≈62.2% in L-ZCO@rGO-30, higher than that in ZCO NSs (≈28.8 at%). It should be noted that the abundant oxygen vacancies generated on L-ZCO@rGO-30 can offer more reactive active sites for redox reactions and improve the electrical conductivity of L-ZCO NPs themselves, thus guaranteeing the rapid electron transport throughout the L-ZCO@rGO-30 electrode."

      "text" : "As discussed above, the as-obtained L-ZCO@rGO-30 hybrid possesses an intriguing structure superiority, which is highly expected as a potential anode for LIBs. Figure  4a shows representative cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of L-ZCO@rGO-30 for the first to third cycles in the potential range from 0.01 to 3.0 V (vs Li/Li+) at 0.2 mV s−1 to analyze the involved Li-storage mechanism. In the initial cathodic sweep, an irreversible reduction peak is evidently located at ≈0.8 V, which can be assigned to the reduction process of ZCO to metallic Zn/Co, along with the formation of Li2O and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer.[14] As regards the anodic scan, two obvious oxidation peaks are observed at around 1.7 and 2.14 V, corresponding to the oxidation of Zn to Zn2+ and Co to Co3+, respectively. As noted, the subsequent cycles in cathodic process are wholly different with the initial one. Two distinguished peaks at ≈0.94 and ≈1.07  V, corresponding to the reduction reactions of ZnO to Zn and Co3O4 to Co, respectively, are detected in the following cathodic processes.[57] The reduction/oxidation peaks overlap very well after the initial cycle, demonstrating the superior reversibility of the Li+ insertion/extraction processes in the L-ZCO@rGO-30\nanode. Based on the CV analysis, the discharge/charge processes of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 electrode can be rationally inferred and expressed by following Equations (1)–(5)[50,56]\nZnCo O 8Li 8e Zn 2Co 4Li O2 4 + 2+ + → + +− (1)\nZn Li e LiZn+ + ↔+ − (2)"

The noticeable potential plateaus in the plots are consistent well with the CV analysis above. The initial discharge/ charge capacities of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 are estimated as ≈1230/≈915 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, and ≈1103/≈798 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 (Figure S4a, Supporting Information), corresponding to high initial Coulombic efficiencies (CE) of ≈74.4% and 72.3%, respectively. The irreversible capacity loss of <28% may be reasonably ascribed to the electrolyte decomposition and extra lithium consumption in the formation of SEI layer.[14,19,20] Appealingly, the L-ZCO NSs still obtain the initial discharge/ charge capacities of ≈1261/≈906 mAh g−1, corresponding to a first CE of 71.8% at 0.2 A g−1 (Figure S4b, Supporting Information). While the ZCO NSs only render a specific discharge capacity of ≈927 mAh g−1, along with an initial CE value of ≈70.9% at the same current density (Figure S4c, Supporting Information). Besides, in the 50th cycle at 0.2 A g−1, the L-ZCO@rGO-30 still retains large discharge/charge capacities of ≈1142/≈1127 mAh g−1, which are even higher than those of the L-ZCO NSs (≈1048/≈1032 mAh g−1) (Figure S4b, Supporting Information) and ZCO NSs (≈746/≈730 mAh g−1) (Figure S4c, Supporting Information). The higher initial CE and reversible capacities observed in L-ZCO@rGO-30 and L-ZCO NSs, compared to the ZCO NSs, highlight the positive contributions of both the 2D conductive porous rGO and oxygen vacancies to the enhanced Li-storage behaviors. Besides the improvement in electric conductivity owing to the introduction of conductive porous rGO, the abundant oxygen vacancies in the well-dispersed nano L-ZCO will further enhance electroactive sites and electronic conductivity for efficient electrochemical reactions occurring in the L-ZCO@rGO-30.\nTo further identify the virtues of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 hybrid for LIBs, rate capabilities of ZCO NSs, L-ZCO NSs, and L-ZCO@ rGO-30 at progressive rates are comparatively carried out as presented in Figure  4c. Encouragingly, the L-ZCO@rGO-30 anode delivers specific discharge capacities of ≈1053, ≈1153, ≈1073, ≈969, ≈882, and 793 mAh g−1 as the current densities are set as 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 A g−1, respectively. While, the L-ZCO electrode presents reversible capacities of ≈903 and ≈529 mAh g−1 at current density of 0.05 and 1.6 A g−1, respectively (Figure S5, Supporting Information). What is particularly worth noting is that even at a super high current\nSmall 2020, 2001526\n2001526 (6 of 11)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\nwww.small-journal.com\ndensity of 3.2 A g−1, a competitive capacity of ≈686 mAh g−1 is still maintained by the L-ZCO@rGO-30, corresponding to a capacity retention of ≈65.1% with a 64-time increase in the current density. While, the discharge capacities of only ≈126 and ≈419 mAh g−1 are retained for the ZCO and L-ZCO NSs electrodes at 3.2 A g−1, corresponding to the capacity decays of ≈15.5% and ≈46.4% for the two with the same increase in current densities. Moreover, with the current density further being reduced immediately to 0.05 A g−1, the capacity can be resumed as ≈1185 mAh g−1 for the L-ZCO@rGO-30 anode, along with the recovered capacities of ≈852 and ≈991 mAh g−1 for the ZCO and L-ZCO NSs, respectively. The L-ZCO@rGO-30 electrode exhibits more prominent rate capability measured in the rate range of 0.05–3.2 A g−1, which persuasively verifies the decisive role of the introduced abundant oxygen vacancies and porous rGO in the exceptional electrochemical properties of L-ZCO@rGO-30 anode. More remarkably, as comparatively exhibited in Figure  4d, the rate capability obtained here for the L-ZCO@rGO-30 electrode is superior to other ZCObased anodes reported before, particularly at large current densities.[14,22,23,27,29,33,46,56] To figure out the underlying reasons for superb rate behaviors of the L-ZCO@rGO-30, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was further performed. Typical Nyquist plots of the ZCO NSs, L-ZCO NSs, and L-ZCO@rGO-30 electrodes are profiled in Figure  4e, and further fitted with the equivalent circuit model (Figure S6, Supporting Information). As observed in Figure 4e, the depressed semicircles with various diameters mean the different SEI layer resistance and charge-transfer resistance (Rf+ct). Evidently, the L-ZCO@rGO-30 exhibits a much smaller Rf+ct (≈75.4 ohm) as compared to those of the ZCO NSs (≈147.2 ohm) and L-ZCO NSs (≈106.1 ohm), which convincingly validates the fast electron/ion transfer in the L-ZCO@rGO-30 electrode, thanks to\nSmall 2020, 2001526\n2001526 (7 of 11)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\nwww.small-journal.com\nsynergistic effects of the porous rGO and oxygen vacancies in L-ZCO NPs. Furthermore, the lithium-ion diffusion coefficient (D) of the electrodes can be rationally derived from the EIS data according to the following formulas\nD 2\n2 2\n2 4 4 2 2\nR T\nA n F C σ =\n(6)\nZ D L 1/2σω′ = + + −R R (7)\nwhere R, T, A, n, F, C, σ, and ω are the gas constant, absolute temperature, surface area, the number of transferred electrons, Faraday constant, concentration of lithium ions, Warburg factor, and the angular frequency (ω  = 2πƒ).[58,59] Thus, the Warburg factor σ can be obtained from the Z' as a function of ω−1/2 (Figure 4f). The slopes of Z' versus ω−1/2 for the ZCO NSs, L-ZCO NSs, and L-ZCO@rGO-30 electrodes are fitted as 342.7, 216.9, and 96.3, respectively. Considering other same parameters, hence, the D values qualitatively comply with the following order: ZCO < L-ZCO < L-ZCO@rGO-30. Accordingly, it is easy to conclude that it is the one-step laser-irradiationinduced oxygen-vacancy abundant nano L-ZCO and porous rGO that together guarantee the large Li+ diffusion coefficient, enhanced electronic conductivity, rich active sites, and reduced charge-transfer resistance for exceptional lithium storage of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 anode.\nFigure 4g illustrates the cycling performance of the resultant ZCO NSs, L-ZCO NSs, and L-ZCO@rGO-30 electrodes. Clearly, the L-ZCO NSs still keep a discharge capacity as large as ≈846 mAh g−1 after 200 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, while just ≈601 mAh g−1 for the ZCO NSs. What is more, the L-ZCO@rGO-30 electrode further obtains high discharge capacities of ≈943 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at current density of 0.5 A g−1, and even ≈1333 at 0.2 A g−1, much higher than that of the rGO (Figure S7, Supporting Information), which reveals the superior cycling stability of L-ZCO@rGO-30. The continuous capacity growth from the second cycle observed in the L-ZCO@rGO-30 anode is in good line with other reported TMO anodes.[18,34,60–63] Such phenomenon can be reasonably elucidated by the gradual activation process and “lithiation-induced reactivation” mechanism.[27,64] Additionally, the CE value rapid reaches over 96% at the third cycle, and afterward, it keeps all along about 100%, exhibiting the strikingly reversible Li+ insertion/desertion over consecutively cycling. Noticeably, no matter whether the laser irradiation time further increases (i.e., 40  min) or reduces (i.e., 20  min), the modest lithium storage capacities are always observed in the L-ZCO@rGO hybrids. To be specific, the lower specific capacities of ≈785 and ≈708 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 200 cycles are obtained by the L-ZCO@rGO-20 and L-ZCO@rGO-40, respectively (Figure S8, Supporting Information). It should be mainly related to their unique structural characteristics (Figure S1b,c, Supporting Information), as discussed above, which are not favorable to electrochemical lithium storage.\nThe long-term cycle stability, especially at high current density, is very critical for commercial applications of LIBs. Accordingly, the long-duration cycling behavior of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 electrode is further investigated at a large current density of 1.0 A g−1\nfor 250 uninterrupted cycles. As shown in Figure  5a, the L-ZCO@rGO-30 can steadily keep a discharge capacity as large as ≈746 mAh g−1 after 250 cycles. However, the ZCO and L-ZCO NSs provide discharge capacities of only ≈369 and ≈514 mAh g−1 in the same case (Figure S9, Supporting Information). The exceptional high-rate cyclic property of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 should be rationally attributed to the remarkable confinement of the nanoscale L-ZCO in the flexible rGO over cycling. It can effectively buffer volume expansion and restrain serious aggregation of electroactive L-ZCO NPs, ensuring structural stability of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 anode, which can be further authenticated by the cross-section FESEM observations before and after cycling (Figure 5b,c). Apparently, after 250 cycles, the thickness of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 electrode slightly increases from 5.2 to 5.5 µm, highlighting the robust structural stability of the hybrid electrode during high-rate cycles.\nTo further elucidate the excellent lithium-storage performance of L-ZCO@rGO-30, in-depth kinetic analysis was performed as well based on the CV curves under different scan rates (0.1– 2.0 mV s−1) (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Here, the relationship between the measured peak current (i) and scanning rate (v) can be described by the equation: i = avb = k1v + k2v0.5, where the b value reflects specific Li+ storage behaviors.[9,37,50,65] The b values for peaks 1, 2, 3, and 4 are obtained as ≈0.89, ≈0.83, ≈0.80, and ≈0.70 by calculating the slope of log(i) versus log(ν) plots (Figure 5d), respectively, fully confirming that the pseudocapacitance controlled process dominates electrochemical Listorage behaviors of the L-ZCO@rGO-30. At a high sweep rate of 2.0 mV s−1, the dominant capacitive contribution of ≈95% (red region) can be estimated from the CV curve (Figure  5e). The contribution ratios of the capacitance-controlled (red region) and diffusion-dominated (green region) processes (Figure 5f) in other lower sweep rates of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0 mV s−1 are estimated as ≈82%, ≈89%, ≈91%, ≈92%, and ≈94%, respectively, as derived from the CV curves of the hybrid electrode (Figure S11, Supporting Information). Obviously, typical capacitive contribution occupies a high proportion of the total capacity of L-ZCO@rGO-30, which probably results from its rich surface/interfaces, benefiting the pseudocapacitive lithium storage in the hybrid anode. As a result, the L-ZCO@rGO-30 is endowed with larger reversible capacities and longer cycle behaviors even at high rates.\nSuch tremendous improvement in electrochemical lithiumstorage properties of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 hybrid electrode can be reasonably attributed to the following aspects, as schematically depicted in Figure  5g. First, the well-dispersed L-ZCO NPs on the highly conductive porous rGO can abridge the ion/electron transport distance, thus remarkably promoting electrochemical utilization of L-ZCO NPs. Second, the introduction of porous rGO restrains the agglomeration of L-ZCO NPs and buffers their huge volumetric change, while the mesopores in the rGO provide convenient channels for fast ion diffusion meanwhile. Third, the abundant oxygen vacancies in situ generated on the surface of L-ZCO NPs during the irradiation further improve the electric conductivity, along with plentiful active sites for electrochemical redox reactions. Last but not the least, the high-ratio capacitive contribution of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 anode itself enhances the reversible capacities and long-duration cycling capability particularly at large current densities.\nSmall 2020, 2001526\n2001526 (8 of 11)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\nwww.small-journal.com\nEncouraged by the remarkable performance of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 anode, full cells are further fabricated with a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (LNCM) as the cathode with a designed anode/cathode capacity ratio of 1.3: 1 (Figure  6a). Based on the charge–discharge profiles (Figure  6b), the mass of L-ZCO@rGO-30 anode is ≈5.6 times that of the LNCM cathode. When evaluated in the half-cell, the average working voltage of the Ni2+, Ni3+, and Ni4+ in the LNCM is ≈4.2 V (vs Li/Li+), and the average work voltage for the Zn2+ and Co3+ redox couple in the L-ZCO@rGO-30 anode is ≈1.1 V (vs Li/Li+). Accordingly, a working voltage of 3.1 V is obtained for the L-ZCO@rGO-30// LNCM full cell (Figure  6c). The full cell displays the average discharge capacities of ≈123, ≈119, ≈113, ≈107, and ≈100 mAh g−1 at current densities ranging from 0.05 to 0.30 A g−1 (based on the cathode), as profiled in Figure 6d, indicating the superior rate performance of the full cell. In addition, the full cell exhibits superior cycling stability accompanied by high CE values (≈100%) at 0.1 A g−1 after several activation cycles at a low current density of 0.05 A g−1 (Figure 6e)."

      "text" : "In summary, we first devised a rapid yet efficient laser irradiation involved methodology toward controllable synthesis of the oxygen-vacancy abundant nano-ZnCo2O4/porous rGO hybrids. With the simple laser irradiation, the ZCO NSs can be broken into oxygen-vacancies abundant NPs, which are homogenously coupled with the formed porous rGO NSs. In the unique 2D hybrids, the abundant oxygen vacancies in situ created on the surface of L-ZCO NPs augment the plentiful active sites for electrochemical redox reactions and reduce transfer resistance. The mesopores in rGO NSs provide convenient channels for fast ion diffusion, and meanwhile, the porous rGO NSs buffer the volume change and restrain the aggregation of L-ZCO NPs during the continuous lithium insertion/ desertion process. Benefiting from the attractive merits mentioned above, the optimal L-ZCO@rGO-30 exhibits a high reversible capacity of ≈746 mAh g−1 at a high current density of 1.0 A g−1 after 250 cycles, and delivers excellent rate capability of\nSmall 2020, 2001526\n2001526 (9 of 11)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Corresponding quantitative analysis demonstrates that the pseudocapacitance-controlled process dominates the electrochemical lithium storage of the hybrid electrodes. In addition, the assembled L-ZCO@rGO-30//LNCM full cell exhibits a discharge specific capacity of ≈119 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. More significantly, the rapid laser-induced synthesis strategy proposed here is highly universal to other advanced hybrid anodes for next-generation LIBs and beyond."

      "text" : "Synthesis of ZnCo2O4 Nanosheets (ZCO NSs): All the chemicals here were used directly without any further purification. In a typical synthesis, a certain of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (Aladdin, Mw  = 1 300 000  g mol−1) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (≥99.5%, Sinopharm) to obtain a solution with a concentration of 12.5  mg mL−1. Then, 1  mmol of Zn(NO3)2 · 6H2O (≥99.0%, Sinopharm), 2  mmol of Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O (≥99.0%, Macklin), and 5 mmol of p-phthalic acid (≥99.0%, Aladdin) were dissolved in the above solution (40 mL). After stirred vigorously for 30 min, the obtained homogenous solution was poured into a Teflon-line stainlesssteel autoclave (50 mL), and further kept at 180 °C for 2 h. The precipitate was collected, dried, and then annealed at 500 °C for 2 h under an air flow. Finally, the black powder was obtained and designed as ZCO NSs.\nSynthesis of Laser-Irradiated ZnCo2O4/rGO (L-ZCO@rGO) Hybrids: The graphene oxide (GO) was prepared by the modified Hummer’s method.[66] 0.03  g of the prepared ZCO NSs was added into a beaker with 12  mL of GO solution (0.8  mg mL−1). Subsequently, the resulted mixture solution was irradiated with the beam of a KrF excimer laser (10  Hz, Coherent, CompexPro 205), and subjected to continuously stirring meanwhile. The laser fluence was 400 mJ pulse−1 cm−2. Afterward, the sample was fabricated by freeze-drying, and marked as\nL-ZCO@rGO-30 for further characterizations. The laser-irradiated ZCO (L-ZCO) NSs were also prepared in the absence of GO. The porous rGO was prepared without the ZCO NSs under laser irradiation. For comparison, other hybrid products, denoted as L-ZCO@rGO-x (x for the irradiation duration), were fabricated including the L-ZCO@rGO-20 and L-ZCO@rGO-40.\nMaterial Characterizations: Crystal structures of the products were determined by XRD (Rigaku D/Max-2500, filtered Cu Kα radiation, λ  = 0.1542  nm). Raman test was conducted by Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution (532  nm laser). Morphologies and microstructures of samples were carried out using FESEM (FEI QUANTA FEG250), TEM, and HRTEM (FEI Tecnai G2 F20 TEM). To calculate the content of rGO in the L-ZCO@rGO hybrid, TG analysis (TGA/DSC1/1600HT) was performed in air. Specific chemical states of elements in products were characterized by XPS (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI).\nElectrochemical Measurements: Electrochemical performance of electrodes was evaluated based on stainless-steel coin cells (CR 2025). The slurry was consisted of the active materials (ZCO NSs, L-ZCO NS, or L-ZCO@rGO hybrids, 70  wt%), acetylene black (Super-P, 20  wt%), and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (10  wt%) with the water as a solvent. The mass loading of active materials on the disks was about 1.1  mg cm−2. The electrolyte was 1 m LiPF6 in the mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (1:1 in volume). The lithium foil and Cegard 2400 polyprop membrane were used as the counter electrode and separator, respectively. The galvanostatic charge–discharge experiments were carried out by using a battery testing system (CT 2001A). CV was measured on the CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instruments) in a voltage range of 0.01–3.0  V at room temperature. EIS analysis from 100 kHz to 100 mHz was carried out using a Zahner/ Zennium electrochemical workstation.\nThe cathode for a full cell was fabricated by mixing commercial LNCM, acetylene black (Super-P, 20  wt%), polyvinylidene fluoride with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 with the N-methyl-2 pyrrolidone to form a slurry, which was pasted uniformly on the aluminum foil and dried at 110  °C\nSmall 2020, 2001526\n2001526 (10 of 11)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Before assembling full cells, prelithiation of the L-ZCO@rGO-30 anode was conducted to compensate for the high initial irreversible capacity loss. In brief, the L-ZCO@rGO-30 electrode was directly brought into contact with the lithium foil in electrolyte for 2 h with extra pressure.\nSupporting Information Supporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author."
