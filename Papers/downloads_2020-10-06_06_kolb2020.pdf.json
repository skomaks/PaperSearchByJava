    "abstractText" : "Cancer cells are known to be glycolytic, driving increased glucose consumption and its conversion to lactate. This process modulates the tumor microenvironment (TME). In the TME, glycolytically activated immune cells often become anergic, leading to an increase in immune checkpoint proteins such as programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). Most glycolytic inhibitors not only inhibit glycolysis of cancer but also of immune cells. Therefore, using a nanoparticle-delivered agent to preferentially inhibit glycolysis in tumor cells, and not in immune cells, has the potential to attenuate the expression of checkpoint proteins. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) can be an important target to achieve tumor speci c glycolysis inhibition. We report TME modulation by a mitochondrion-targeted nanoparticle (NP) containing a prodrug of dichloroacetate (DCA), a PDK1 inhibitor. We demonstrated that the targeted NP alters the TME which results in increased immunological activation against cancer cells, causing a decrease in mean tumor volume. Here, we also show ndings that when Mito-DCA, a prodrug of DCA, was combined with anti-PD-1, a checkpoint inhibitor, results fromin vivosyngeneic models showed an upregulation in the number of tumor in lt ating lymphocytes. This work provides a platform to bring therapeutic e cacy by selectively inhibiting glycolysis of cancer cells.",
