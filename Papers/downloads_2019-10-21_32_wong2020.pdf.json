The morphological, structural and electrochemical characteristics of the nanostructured material were evaluated using X-ray diffraction, confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and voltammetric techniques. The synergy between these materials increased the electrochemical activity, the electron transfer rate and the electrode surface area, leading to a high magnitude of the anodic peak current for the determination of amoxicillin. The electrochemical determination of the antibiotic was carried out using square-wave voltammetry. Under the optimised experimental conditions, the proposed sensor showed high sensitivity, repeatability and stability to amoxicillin determination, with an analytical curve in the amoxicillin concentration range from 0.90 to 69 μmol L−1, and a low detection limit of 50 nmol L−1. No significant interference in the electrochemical signal of amoxicillin was observed from potential biological interferences and drugs widely used, such as uric acid, paracetamol, urea, ascorbic acid and caffeine. It was demonstrated that without any sample pre-treatment and using a simple measurement device, the sensor could be an alternative method for not only the analysis of pharmaceutical products (commercial tablets) and clinical samples (urine), but also to examine food quality (milk samples)."

      "text" : "Medicines to combat health problems, can become a threat when they are administered incorrectly, without medical supervision or control. In moderate use, they can cause adverse effects due to overdoses, and inadequate consumption in situations where there are contraindications or interactions between different drugs.\nAmoxicillin (AMX) is one of the most commonly used antibiotics for otitis, pneumonia, genital infections and urinary infections [1–3]. Nowadays, there is a great attention and concern for emerging pollutants. There is a high discard of pollutants in rivers and seas of different classes such as pesticides, hormones and antibiotics. These antibiotics can persist after water purification treatments, and even at low concentrations, they can potentially exert biological effects [4]. However,\nthe high possibility of the escape of antibiotics, especially AMX, into environmental water also implies a high potential of contaminating our tap water either as original or as transformed products [5,6]. The potential risk of environmental contamination by drugs from human excretion or inadequate disposal at the end of their shelf-life makes these compounds emergent pollutants [7]. The monitoring of antibiotics in the aquatic environment is progressively becoming a priority for government and regulatory agencies as well as the general public [8]. Thus, the development of modern strategies of analysis to measure these antibiotics, e.g. AMX, at low concentration levels are very important.\nMinghua Wang et al.

[10] synthesised novel core−shell heterostructured Prussian blue analogue nanospheres coupled with silver nanoclusters and further exploited these as aptasensors for the detection of a trace bleomycin antibiotic. Electrochemical results displayed that aptasensors exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity, good stability and reproducibility, and acceptable applicability toward bleomycin antibiotic.\nSeveral carbon-based materials, including graphite [11,12], carbon nanofibers [13,14], carbon nanotubes [15,16], fullerenes [17,18], graphene [19,20], boron doped diamond [21,22], nanodiamonds [23,24] and carbon black (CB) [25,26] have been studied for their use in the development of electrochemical sensors.\nAmong these carbon materials, Printex 6L Carbon, also called carbon black (CB) is specially investigated because it is one of the most inexpensive carbon materials and presents favourable electrochemical properties. It is normally constituted of small fine particles with low amounts of organic and inorganic surface compounds [27], and employed in screen printed electrodes for electroanalysis of a variety of analytes. The latter include pesticides [28], toxic metals [29], cholesterol [30], phenolic compounds [31], hormones [32], antibiotics [33] and others. Other nanomaterials that have attracted great attention from the scientific community recently are the nanocrystals of quantum dots (QDs) [34]. Due to its optical-electronic properties, the main application of QDs is in the development of electrochemical devices in combination with other nanomaterials. The good distribution of the QDs sizes in the order from 2 to 6 nm, and the formation of stable thin films favour an increase the intensity of the analytical signal significantly. In addition, conductor polymers such as poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) have also been much studied in electrode modification due to the ability to combine with different nanomaterials, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, metallic nanoparticles and quantum dots [35]. Its good conductivity and properties of making a highly stable and sticky film on the surface of the electrodes makes this sensor platform highly attractive.\nIn this work, a new electrochemical device based in Printex 6L Carbon (P6LC) and cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe) within a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) film is proposed. We believe that the electroanalytical performance of this device is significantly better than the other carbon materials. Furthermore, the detection of AMX in real samples (drugs, milk and urine) may therefore serve as an important indicator of water quality with regard to the ways medical drugs are disposed."

Printex 6L Carbon (P6LC) was obtained from Cabot Corporation.\nAll the electrochemical measurements were performed with an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat (model PGSTAT-30, Eco Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) controlled by NOVA 2.1 software. The electrochemical system was composed by an electrochemical cell of 10mL capacity, three-electrode, where Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1 KCl) was used as a reference electrode, a platinum wire as a counter electrode and a GCE (3.0mm diameter) as a working electrode.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements were performed with a JEOL transmission electron microscope, operating at 200 kV. The QDs deposited onto ultrathin carbon coated were copper grids (300 mesh cooper).\nHPLC-UV analysis was conducted using a Shimadzu® Model 20 A\nliquid chromatograph coupled to an SPD-20 A UV/Vis detector, an SIL–20 A autosampler and a DGU–20A5 degasser. A C18 column (250× 4.6mm, Shim–Pack CLC–ODS) was used positioned inside a Shimadzu® CTO–10AS oven to maintain a constant temperature. The total running time for AMX standard solution was 7min using mobile phase phosphat buffer and acetonitrile in the ratio of 95:5 and detection at a wavelength of 229 nm. This analytical method was used as comparative method [36]."

[37], with some modifications, including using the NaHTe with CdCl2 in the presence of mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) as the stabiliser of nanocrystals. For the synthesis of the Te2− precursor, 1.0 mmol of NaBH4 solution was transferred to a small vial. Then, 10.0mL of deionised water were added, and during the reaction, ultrapure argon gas was injected into the solution to eliminate oxygen and protect the NaHTe from oxidation. Then, 0.4mmol of Te powder was added to the NaBH4 solution. About 2 h later, black tellurium powder disappeared, and the resulting NaHTe in the clear purple-coloured supernatant was generated to prepare the CdTe QDs. At the same time, 0.2mmol of CdCl2 was added to 40.0mL of deionised water. Then, 30 μL of MPA was added and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 9.0 using a 1.0 mol L−1 of NaOH solution. This solution was also purged with argon gas to remove oxygen. Finally, 2.0mL of NaHTe solution was slowly injected into a CdCl2 solution. The molar ratio of Cd/MPA/Te in the reaction solution was 1/1.72/0.4. The mixture was placed in a Teflon coated stainless steel autoclave and heated up to 150 °C for 1 h. CdTe nanocrystals were isolated by precipitation with i-PrOH, followed by centrifugation (4000 rpm for 15min). The obtained precipitate was dried in a desiccator under reduced pressure and re-dispersed in the same volume of water as the initial synthesis, obtaining a 0.20mmol L−1 CdTe solution."

To prepare the sample solution, ten tablets were ground and homogenised in a mortar, then a suitable amount of triturated sample was weighed out and dissolved in deionised water, followed by a filtration step in order to remove any insoluble substances present in the tablets.\nWhole milk sample was prepared according to Hu et al. [39]. Briefly, 0.5 mL of milk was mixed with 4.5mL of methanol. The solutions were spiked with AMX at two concentration levels and after shaking for 30 s. The mixture was ultrasonicated for 5min and then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5min, and the supernatant was collected for further analysis."

      "text" : "The CdTe quantum dots synthesised were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD). In Fig. S1 (Supplementary Material) is shown the results obtained from the CdTe in X-ray diffraction analysis. According to these results, there are three evident peaks located at 24°, 40° and 47°. These peaks are attributed to the crystalline (111), (220) and (311) cubic phase planes of the quantum dots of CdTe (PDF 65-1046) [40].\nFig. 1 shows representative TEM images of the QDs (CdTe) (A-B) and QDs-P6LC (C). Highly polydisperse sphere-like nanoparticles of 4 ± 1 nm covering almost the entire P6LC surface were observed. The\npresence of CdTe quantum dots was confirmed by energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDS) as illustrated in Fig. 1 (D).\nFinally, the roughness and film thickness of the modified electrode were obtained using the Olympus FV3000 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Fig. 1E shows 3D image of the deposited material on glassy carbon surface. The roughness value (Ra) found was 0.12 μm, and the thickness was 6.9 μm. These analysed parameters were important to understand as the increase of the surface area with the modification of the electrode, and to control the capacity current of the system, since it was verified that a greater amount of material deposited in the electrode contributed to an increase of the capacity current, and consequently, a decrease of the sensitivity of the system."

The cyclic voltammograms shown were obtained in 0.1 mol L−1 of phosphate buffer solution at pH 6.0, at a potential range from +0.3 to +1.0 V and scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (Fig. 2).\nIn Fig. 2 (a), no significant electrochemical processes were observed in the voltammetric response of bare GCE in the presence of the 0.50mmol L−1 AMX standard solution. However, in curves (b) and (c), which were results from P6LC-PEDOT:PSS/GCE and QDs-P6LC-PEDOT:PSS/GCE, respectively, a high electrochemical response is obtained in the presence of a solution containing 0.50mmol L−1 AMX, reveals well-defined irreversible oxidation peaks at +0.88 V, corresponding to the oxidation of AMX on electrode surface. It has been reported [41] that these electrochemical processes correspond to the oxidation processes represented in Scheme 1.\nThe influence of scan rates from 10 to 250mV s−1 on the analytical response was investigated for a 0.50mmol L−1 AMX solution (Fig. 3). The anodic peak currents (ipa) of AMX in phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0) shifted to more positive values as the scan rate increased, characterising an irreversible electrochemical reaction. The plot of Δipa vs. v1/2 was linear, indicating that the mass transport of the AMX on the electrode surface occurred by diffusion. Plots of log ipa vs. log v (Fig. 3 inset) showed slope values of 0.43, characteristic of systems controlled by diffusion."

      "heading" : "3.3. Electrochemical determination of AMX using the QDs-P6LCPEDOT:PSS/GCE sensor",
      "text" : "Square wave voltammetry (SWV) experiments were carried out in order to obtain a better observation of the voltammetric processes involved in quantification of AMX. Optimised SWV parameters for the\npotential range from 0.35 to +1.0 V were a frequency of 20 Hz, a step potential of 5 mV, and a pulse amplitude of 75 mV. The measurements were performed in 0.1 mol L−1 phosphate buffer at pH 6.0 containing a 70 μmol L−1 of AMX.\nTo confirm the mechanism of AMX oxidation on the QDs-P6LCPEDOT:PSS/GCE sensor, the dependence on the electrochemical oxidation of AMX on pH was studied by SWV experiments at pH values ranging from 5.0 to 9.0 in phosphate buffer solution containing 70 μmol L−1 AMX. The variation of Ep with pH can provide valuable information about the AMX oxidation process. Reducing the hydrogen ionic concentration of the electrolyte causes a shift in peak potential for AMX oxidation towards more negative values, as can be observed in Fig. 4. This is a consequence of deprotonation during the oxidation process, which is facilitated at higher pH values. The Ep vs. pH (Fig. 4 inset) showed a linear relationship, with a slope of 64mV per pH unit. Therefore, the electrochemical process involves the same number of protons and electrons during the electro oxidation of AMX, which is a typical behaviour for the oxidation of phenols. Thus, we propose that the AMX oxidation process involves one electron and one proton, in agreement with other published studies [41]. The plot of Δipa vs. pH (Fig. 4 inset) for AMX shows that the anodic peak current increases in the pH range of 9.0 to 5.0, reaching a maximum value at pH 6.0. Therefore, pH 6.0 was chosen for its use in subsequent experiments."

The electrochemical oxidation processes of AMX.\n(LOD) obtained was 50 nmol L−1 (18 μg L−1), which was determined using a 3σ/slope ratio, where σ is the standard deviation of the mean value for 10 voltammograms of the blank.\nThe ability to determine AMX in the presence of other organic clinical and/or wastewater compounds, including ascorbic acid and caffeine were investigated (Fig. 6). The SWV experiments were performed in the potential range of 0 to +1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1 KCl) in 0.1 mol L−1 phosphate buffer at pH 6.0 containing 20 μmol L−1 ascorbic acid and caffeine and 10 μmol L−1 paracetamol, and sequential AMX additions, in a range of 0.90–25 μmol L−1. In all the SWV experiments, no overlap was observed between the AMX oxidation peak and the oxidation peaks of the interfering substances. In addition, the large separation of the peak potentials allows, for the first time, selective and simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid, AMX, paracetamol and caffeine in a mixture. The oxidation peak potentials of ascorbic acid, AMX, paracetamol and caffeine are well resolved at the QDs-P6LC-PEDOT:PSS/GCE sensor with peak potentials at +0.18, +0.57, +0.88 and + 1.41 V, respectively.\nFurthermore, the interfering substances did not significantly shift the AMX oxidation peak, indicating that the analytical signal did not suffer interference from these organic clinical and/or wastewater compounds.\nThe analytical performance of the QDs-P6LC-PEDOT:PSS/GCE sensor with other studies reported in the literature in the determination of AMX is presented in Table 1. It could be seen that, except for the study performed by Fouladgar et al., which had a better LOD, the proposed sensor had a concentration linear range and lower detection limit better than other works reported in the literature. Moreover, the GCE modification with QDs-P6LC-PEDOT:PSS is simpler, and the electrode presents higher stability, repeatability and simple operation and lower cost than the graphene-based material ones, even in the presence of possible interferences.\nThe QDs-P6LC-PEDOT:PSS/GCE sensor showed an excellent repeatability in the quantification of a fixed concentration of AMX (45 μmol L−1). After 10 successive measurements using the same electrodes, the sensor showed no significant loss of signal, and the analytical signal diminished by less than 3.0%, as shown in Fig. S2 (Supplementary Material). Another important result is that the sensor stability exhibited a similar response during a week when stored in the desiccator."

When analysing the results presented in Tables 2 and 3, the recoveries ranged from 98% to 108% for AMX determination using the proposed SWV method.

The morphological, structural and electrochemical characteristics of the nanostructured material were evaluated using X-ray diffraction, confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and voltammetric techniques. The synergy between these materials increased the electrochemical activity, the electron transfer rate and the electrode surface area, leading to a high magnitude of the anodic peak current for the determination of amoxicillin. The electrochemical determination of the antibiotic was carried out using square-wave voltammetry. Under the optimised experimental conditions, the proposed sensor showed high sensitivity, repeatability and stability to amoxicillin determination, with an analytical curve in the amoxicillin concentration range from 0.90 to 69 μmol L−1, and a low detection limit of 50 nmol L−1. No significant interference in the electrochemical signal of amoxicillin was observed from potential biological interferences and drugs widely used, such as uric acid, paracetamol, urea, ascorbic acid and caffeine. It was demonstrated that without any sample pre-treatment and using a simple measurement device, the sensor could be an alternative method for not only the analysis of pharmaceutical products (commercial tablets) and clinical samples (urine), but also to examine food quality (milk samples).",
