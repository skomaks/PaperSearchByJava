      "text" : "The World Health Organization states, ‘Cancer is the leading cause of death in the economically developed countries and the second leading cause of death in developing countries’ (World Health Organization, 2008). Typically, surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are the most common cancer treatment modalities being effectively utilized in the field of cancer therapy. However, these conventional modalities have their limitations, in particular in their selectivity of cancer cells. Hence, a highly specific and selective treatment strategy that could target only the malignant cells without affecting the surrounding normal cells and tissues has long been of primary concern. One of the recent approaches that have been increasing the medical community’s attention is photodynamic therapy (PDT) because it overcomes the drawbacks of conventional treatment techniques.\nPDT is a medically recognized method with a selective cytotoxic activity toward cancer cells; the treatment comprises localization of a photosensitizer (PS) irradiated with a\nspecific wavelength of light related to sensitizer’s absorbance band (Agostinis et al., 2011). The US Food and Drug Administration approved the PDT as the first drug-device combination for cancer therapy. PDT is effective against neoplastic and non-malignant diseases (Konan et al., 2002; Vargas et al., 2004). It comprises three vital components: PS, light and oxygen (Figure 1). None of this is individually toxic, but with each other, they generate a reactive oxygen species (ROS). This ROS causes considerable toxicity to the cell via apoptosis or necrosis (Dolmans, 2003).\nPDT promises hold whenever surgery is not possible. Unlike radiation therapy, the low cost and repeatable PDT helps in the long-term management of cancer. It was found to be highly effective in early-stage tumors and helps in the prolonged survival of cancer patients with inoperable conditions (Agostinis et al., 2011). Over the decades, three significant facts in the field of PDT that fairly contributed to this transition into the clinic: (1) an appropriate involvement of industries to sponsor controlled clinical trials (Dougherty,\nCONTACT K. I. Dhanalekshmi dhanamveni88@gmail.com School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China; Xiang Zhang johnnynash20041579@yahoo.com School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China. 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group\n1987), (2) recognition for a wider variety of PSs with improved optical and target localizing properties (Henderson & Dougherty, 1992) and (3) a best and most advanced knowledge of biological mechanisms involved in PDT (1990). In addition to the approaches mentioned above, mechanistic understanding has paved the way for the dramatic increase in the potential applications of PDT and also stands as a platform technology that could be extended to other disease areas. The mechanism of PDT is presented in a simplified Jablonski diagram in Figure 2. The metal-based hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) had gained much attention due to their increased anticancer effect. In this review, we have addressed the role of Ag- and Au-based hybrid NPs in cancer therapy."

      "heading" : "2. Light source",
      "text" : "The successful PDT requires the photoactivation of PS by light. The light transmission into the tissue increases with the increase in wavelength up to 800 nm due to the scattering and absorption by natural chromophores (Bensasson et al., 1993; Dougherty, 2002). Above the wavelength of 800 nm, the activation of the sensitizer is not sufficient to produce singlet oxygen because the triplet state of the sensitizer is below the energy level of singlet oxygen (Allison & Sibata, 2010). Earlier, the photosensitization had been carried out with conventional gas discharge lamps. The metal halogen lamp at high power density emits the radiation at the range of 600–800 nm (Stables & Ash, 1995), however, for the treatment of large lesions, short-arc xenon lamp to transmit the light between 400 and 1200 nm is used (Nitzan et al., 2004). The light delivery system has been improved significantly in the last 20 years and endoscopes and several optical fibers have been developed for the interstitial therapy of larger tumors nowadays.\nLasers have become the primary light source for activation as laser light possesses the properties of monochromatic, coherent nature, very precise and highly intense. In particular, the property of monochromaticity and directionality produces a high optical energy density a few thousand times better than any non-laser light source (Azadgoli & Baker, 2016). This helps deliver a high dose of optical energies on the surface or interior of the body and also the high-\nintensity laser radiation ensures a high rate of photochemical processes (Letokhov, 1985).\nLight-emitting diodes (LEDs) are now being replaced as an alternative light source and gaining more attention due to the convenience and longer treatment times than lasers. LEDs generate light by the relaxation of excited electrons and through the high energy beam of the desired wavelength, which is an advantage in PDT. Besides existing in different configurations and sizes, it is also less expensive and provides broad wavelengths in the range of 350–1100 nm (Klein et al., 2008)."

The mechanism of selective accumulation of hematoporphyrin derivatives (HpD) in tumors is found to be complex and unexplored. Presumably, it could be attributed due to the lack of lymphatic drainage in tumors and the high vascular permeability of the agents (Dougherty et al., 1998).\nPhotofrinVR (Figure 3), a partially purified less active porphyrin monomer of HpD which is also called as porfimer sodium. It is very widely used and first approved PSs for prophylaxis of bladder cancer in Canada (1993). Since then, it has been approved in several countries to treat not only bladder cancer but also esophageal, gastric, cervical and lung cancers (Dougherty et al., 1978)."

Recently, they have been developed to strengthen the outcomes of PDT (Kou et al., 2017). Most PSs are diffused into the whole body that results in poor acceptance and general toxicity of the treatments by patients. The targeted deliveries of PSs to deep-seated cancer cells are the main challenges and a very active area of research in the development of treatment strategies to reduce the side effects of drugs. Therefore, one of the goals in targeted therapies is to improve the chemically derivatized\nFigure 1.

      "heading" : "4. Disadvantages of organic photosensitizers",
      "text" : "The organic PSs applied in PDT have some limitations. The porphyrin derivatives have a planar structure with aggregated form that occurred because of its steady p–p stacking in concentrated solutions that decrease the quantum yield of singlet oxygen (Arunkumar et al., 2007). Also, the synthesis of porphyrin derivatives by conventional methods is difficult. Besides these, porphyrins find limited applications in imaging due to small stoke shifts. Second-generation PS exhibited suboptimal tumor selectivity, prolonged skin photosensitivity in patients, poor light penetration into the tumor (Baas et al., 1995; Orenstein, 1996; Spikes, 1990). The other\nchromophores, such as phthalocyanine, squaraine dye and perylene diimide exhibited low chemical stability. Hence, to overcome the drawbacks of conventional PSs, the advantages of non-toxic NPs in PDT have been exploited by researchers (Meena et al., 2007; Meena, Venkataraman, Aruna, et al., 2011; Meena, Venkataraman, Ganesan, et al., 2011)."

      "heading" : "5. Noble metals as nano-photosensitizer",
      "text" : "Noble metal plasmonic NPs possess various advantages over organic PSs. It demonstrates the ease of synthesis, characterization and possesses surface functionalization. Among them, gold and silver show unique size- and shape-dependent optoelectronic properties. Moreover, Ag and Au NPs significantly enhanced the higher extinction coefficients than standard organic PSs (Dhanalekshmi et al., 2019; Krajczewski et al., 2019).\nPlasmonic (noble metal) NPs exhibit unique surface plasmon resonance (SPR) that distinguishes from other nanoplatforms like semiconductor quantum dots, magnetic and polymeric NPs. Radiative and non-radiative properties of the NPs are enhanced by the SPR that results from the photo confinement to small particle size (Huang et al., 2007, 2008; Jain et al., 2007, 2008; Lal et al., 2008; Link & El-Sayed, 1999, 2000, 2003; Skrabalak et al., 2008). Thus, the strongly enhanced radiative properties are useful in molecular cancer imaging (El-Sayed et al., 2005; Loo et al., 2004; Sokolov, Aaron, et al. 2003; Sokolov, Follen, et al., 2003)."

      "text" : "Noble metal NPs are conclusively proved to be more attractive, mainly because of the targeting of multiple pathways.\nFigure 2. Mechanism of PDT.\nFigure 3. Structure of Photofrin.\nAu NPs enters the cell membrane via diffusion and alters the endocytotic process of NPs. The NPs size plays an essential role in cellular uptake. The NPs with 40–50 nm provide better internalization into cells (Asharani et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2008; Pelka et al., 2009). Chan et al. have reported the rapid entry of 50 nm Au NPs into the cells compared to the other differently sized NPs (Arora et al., 2009). Surface charge is a crucial factor and influences the cellular uptake of the NPs that allows either specific or non-specific interactions within the cellular lipid bilayer. The positively charged NPs pass the cellular membrane via electrostatics and modulate the membrane potential of cells. The negatively charged NPs are passively reaching the cytosol by targeting the lipophilic domains (Goodman et al., 2004; Verma & Stellacci, 2010). Similarly, Ag NPs also had shown better ROS production, specifically toxic to the tumor cells via DNA damage.\nNoble metal NPs have thermally ablated the tumor tissue in vitro and in vivo and have taken advantage of PDT anticancer therapy promptly because of its SPR effect (Cardinal et al., 2008; Pitsillides et al., 2003).\nAggregation is one of the major drawbacks with the Ag and Au NPs of diameter less than 200 nm, which subsequently results in the decreased reach to the tumor sites. Also, the stability decreases by inhibiting its use in long-term applications (Sharma et al., 2009) however, this has been overcome by the use of a wide range of materials such as TiO2 (Li et al., 2008), SiO2 (Whitesides, 2005) and ZrO2 to support Ag and Au NPs (Chaloupka et al., 2010).\nLow singlet oxygen generation of few organic PSs is also a major disadvantage and possibly the synthetic organic photosensitizing molecules with absorption band at red or near-infrared (NIR) overcomes the drawback despite the time-consuming and complicated processes (Basu et al., 2012; Higgins & Brewer, 2012; Schmidt, 2006). The efficacy of singlet oxygen generation is found to be increased by placing the PS molecule to the metal NP surface (Gil-Tomas et al., 2007; Ke et al., 2014; Ragas et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2008). The other factors that enhance the singlet oxygen generation are resonance coupling between photosensitizing molecules and metal NPs.\nFigure 4. (a) Porphyrin, (b) chlorin, (c) bacteriochlorin and (d) phthalocyanine.\nFigure 5. Schematic diagram of Ag- and Au-based hybrid nanoparticles in PDT.\nHence, the hybridization of PSs with NPs had shown increased PDT and photodynamic inactivation efficacy (Hayden et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2014)."

      "text" : "The properties of inorganic materials such as durability, heat resistance, toxicity, selectivity make it superior to organic materials. From the NPs’ perspective, silver possesses low toxicity in human beings and finds a difference in the applications in both in vitro and in vivo (Farooqui et al., 2010). The large surface area increases the contact area with the microbial surfaces and ultimately resulting in improved bactericidal action at lower concentrations. Conventional Ag NPs contain the size of 20–25 nm. As a result of increased surface area, it enhances the activity of Ag and significantly increasing its bactericidal action. Thus, the bactericidal properties of Ag NPs had shown an increased magnitude in bactericidal activity than the Ag in bulk. Ag NPs exhibit the principal characteristic of high surface area to volume ratio, which leads to the development of new mechanical, chemical, electrical, optical, magnetic, electro-optical and magneto-optical properties of the NPs that are different from their bulk properties (Whitesides, 2005). The shells covering metal NPs separate the metal nanospheres and prevent aggregation by making the metal particles more stable in air. Ag NPs show enhanced photodynamic action and safe on mammalian cells.\nHybrid PSs had shown substantial improvements in the production of singlet oxygen and PDT efficacy against cancer cells and also as an active antimicrobial agent. The mesoporous silica mSiO2 encapsulated silver NPs using hematoporphyrin under both visible and red/NIR illuminations have inhibited the growth of HeLa cells (Wang et al., 2016). Similarly, Ag@mSiO2@HPIX and Ag@BCP hybrid NPs are the other effective hybrid NPs exhibiting PDT activity as a photosensitizing agent (Ding et al., 2016).\nBesides the anticancer activity, the PEGylation of Agdoped semiconductor NPs of zinc oxide had resulted in the biocompatibility enhancement and increased the 77%–83% singlet oxygen production and 18%–27% hydroxyl radical formation and increased permeability of the cell membrane leading to the death of the parasites such as Leishmania (Nadhman et al., 2014). Ag-doped silica nanospheres had shown an effective antimicrobial activity against microorganisms and PSs in PDT (Wysocka-Kr ol et al., 2018). In addition, the hybrid NPs such as Ag@SiO2@Agseed had given higher photothermal properties at lower concentrations (Manivannan et al., 2019) and the Ag NPs deposited over aromatic poly (amidoamine) grafted carbon nanotubes CNTsPAMAM-Ag had exhibited photothermal stability and effectiveness under 980 nm laser irradiation (Neelgund & Aderemi, 2018)."

The use of gold finds applications in material science, medicine, catalysis and fluorescence spectral engineering (Liao et al., 2006; Narayanan & El-Sayed, 2005). It has superior physical and chemical properties such as corrosion-resistant, low toxicity and conformational flexibility (Loo et al., 2004; Schwartzberg et al., 2006).\nGold colloidal NPs have unique optical properties and possess the size effective collective oscillation of electrons in the conduction band that increases the properties of surface plasmon absorption in the visible region (Kazemi et al., 2011). The other unique property of the Au NPs is the conversion of heat on the picoseconds time scale, which can be used for the photothermal destroying of several cancerous cells (Limaye & Helble, 2004). The irreversible growth and agglomeration are prevented by the protection of surface by surface ligands. The schematic diagram of Ag- and Au-based hybrid NPs in PDT is shown in Figure 5.\nAu@SiO2 core-shell NPs had decreased the cancer cell viability remarkably by PDT studies by the photogeneration of singlet oxygen on cancer cells (Meena et al., 2016). The cell viability decreased with the increase in the concentration of NPs and had exhibited good photodynamic activity due to the SiO2 deposited on the surface of Au NPs. Likewise, Au@TiO2 and Au@ZrO2 core-shell NPs had also exhibited the PDT activity in HeLa cell line.\nAu@ZrO2 core-shell NPs had shown remarkable photodynamic cancer activity at 200mg/ml of NPs and the inhibition of the 75% of cancer cells growth at the concentration for 107.31 J/cm2 of light dosage. They were thus enlightening the influence of different light dosages on the PDT activity (Meena & Dhanalekshmi, 2016).\nAu@Graphene oxide NPs had shown multifunctional properties and possible applications for the combined treatment of photothermal and PDT (Kim et al., 2015). In the NIR region, Au nanocage@MnO2 NPs generate the ROS responsible for the immunogenic PDT against mTNBC (Liang et al., 2018). The in vitro Photodynamic activity of Ag- and Aubased hybrid NPs is shown in Table 1."

      "text" : "PDT is an emerging therapy for the treatment of cancer. Recently, the Ag- and Au-based hybrid NPs have been considered mainly for PDT applications in treating superficial tumor lesions due to the small size and their preferential accumulation in tumor sites. Besides, the surface coating also prevents aggregation and has increased the stability of the noble metals with a remarkable effect in the PDT. Hence, further in vivo-based cancer research studies on Ag- and Aubased hybrid NPs helps to understand the complete pharmacological mechanism. The future improvements in their efficiency by optimizing PDT parameters, developing and exploring new nano-PSs combinations/hybrids with absorption band at wavelengths within the more extended visible region could help in the development of more novel hybrid NP PS for cancer treatment.\nDisclosure statement\nThe authors have no conflict of interest."

    "abstractText" : "The utilization of photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been rapidly increasing due to its advantage as an effective treatment modality for cancer. The organic photosensitizers employed for PDT have some disadvantages, including high toxicity, non-selectivity toward tumors and poor absorption of light. The low light penetration into the tumor sites resulting from low wavelength of absorption and long-term skin photosensitivity. Hence, the attention toward non-toxic inorganic photosensitizers like noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) has been increasing nowadays. In bioscience, NPs are replacing organic dyes since they have photostability and non-toxicity. Generally, nanomaterials can easily form compounds with other substances as well as organic materials and the modified NPs surface enhances the chemical activity. Among the metal NPs, noble metals, especially gold and silver are attractive because of their size and shape-dependent unique optoelectronic properties. The coating of inorganic/organic materials on top of the noble metal makes the NPs bio-compatible and less toxic. Furthermore, Agand Aubased inorganic/organic complex NPs could offer a new possibility because of their unique structures. Meanwhile, the coating of inorganic/organic complex NPs protects the noble metals and stabilizes them against chemical corrosion and enhances the production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, in this review, we have highlighted the role of Agand Au-based inorganic/organic hybrid nano-photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy.
