Response surface methodology was adopted to explore the influences of temperature, contact pressure, and composite concentration on the tribological properties of diesel engine oil. The anti-wear mechanism of nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites was simultaneously studied by comparing with the tribological behavior of graphene oxide and nano-La(OH)3 pure particles. Results indicate that nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites can remarkably improve the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil under boundary lubrication conditions. In particular, the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil increased by 44% after adding 0.1 wt% composites at a temperature of 80 �C and a contact pressure of 1.62 GPa. The synergistic anti-wear mechanism of graphene and lanthanum oxide was proposed on the basis of worn surface characterization."

      "text" : "Friction and wear are widely known to result in mechanical equipment failure and huge energy resource dissipation [1]. Among the machinery losing of diesel engine, the friction and wear between engine internal transmission components are approximately 75% [2]. Diesel engine oil must effectively control friction and reduce wear of engine mechanical components to ensure the efficient operation of mechanical parts and extend the service life of the diesel engine [3]. The anti-wear additive plays a key role in the tribological properties of diesel engine oil. However, with the rapid development of high-efficiency mechanical equipment, the load per unit mass of a heavy-duty vehicle engine becomes heavy, causing traditional lubricant additives to hardly meet the new diesel engine equipment demands of high speed, high temperature and heavy load operating conditions [4,5]. Therefore, developing novel effective anti-wear lubricant additives with good wear resistance and high bearing capacity is urgently needed to meet the demands of heavy-duty equipment under severe service conditions.\nGraphene, as a 2D honeycomb lattice arranged by sp2 carbon atoms, has elicited considerable attention in the field of lubrication materials due to its ultrathin layer structure and excellent physicochemical properties [6,7]. However, graphene is prone to forming aggregates due\nto the strong π–π bonding interaction between nanosheets, and the chemical inertia leads to poor compatibility with other compounds [8]. Consequently, graphene experiences difficulty in achieving stable dispersion in oil-based systems; thus, its application as lubricant additive is limited. Graphene oxide (GO), as a derivative of graphene, has several functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl and carbonyl on the surface [9]. GO has been found to exhibit certain dispersion stability in lubricants after surface modification. A number of studies have reported the good tribological properties of GO in lubricants. Senatore et al. [10] investigated the tribological behavior of GO nanosheets in mineral oil under different conditions and proved that GO easily forms protective films that prevent direct contact between steel surfaces and improve the tribological behavior of the base oil. Chen et al. [11] systematically investigated the tribological properties of a few layered GO sheet in hydrocarbon base oil and found that the coefficient of friction and wear are decreased with the addition of GO sheets. Nevertheless, similar to graphene, GO is easily corrugated during sliding, which increases friction between interfaces and results in the loss of its excellent tribological properties [12]. Surface functionalization can be used to effectively improve the tribological properties of GO, and it has attracted much attention in the present decade. Numerous methods have been utilized to develop functional GO nanomaterials,\n* Corresponding author. E-mail address: xghu@hfut.edu.cn (X.

Functionalization with nanoparticles can be realized by depositing nanoparticles onto GO. This method provides a research direction for the development of novel graphene-based lubricant additives.\nRecently, rare earth elements have attracted considerable attention in the field of lubrication because of their special physical and chemical properties, such as strong chemical activity, large atomic radius and low electronegativity [14–16]. Nano-La(OH)3, as an important light rare earth compound, has been found to have unique tribological properties that differ from those of other metal oxides due to the strong chemical activity at the friction interface of La with a special 4f electronic structure. Zhao et al. [17] found that the La element in nano-La(OH)3 can function as a catalyst to accelerate the ion exchange reaction of O, Si and Fe tribofilm formation, which make serpentine/La(OH)3 composites to exhibit better tribological properties than those of a single serpentine or La(OH)3 particle in lubricating oil. Zhang et al. [18] found that succinimide modified La(OH)3 nanoparticles and ZDDP exert a synergistic effect on improving the tribological performance of liquid paraffin. The preceding references demonstrate that nano-La(OH)3 has good compatibility with and tribological synergistic effect on other compounds in lubricants; thus, it is more promising as a lubricant additive than other metal oxides. Accordingly, nano-La(OH)3 with special tribological properties was selected in the current study to functionalize GO and obtain a novel nano-La(OH)3/RGO composite additive for diesel engine oil. We expect to significantly improve the tribological properties of diesel engine oil through the synergistic effect of nano-La(OH)3 and GO, so as to meet the harsh conditions of a diesel engine at high speed, temperature and load.\nTemperature and contact pressure are known to exert certain influences on the anti-wear and anti-friction properties of a lubricant. Exploring the applicability of nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites at different temperatures and contact pressures is necessary to provide data reference for their application as diesel engine oil additives. In the current study, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to systematically analyze the effects of different temperatures, contact pressures and composite concentrations on the anti-wear and anti-friction properties of diesel engine oil because it is a useful experimental design method to study the effects of multivariate variables, including their interaction on response value [19–21]. The anti-wear mechanism of nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites in diesel engine oil was also investigated by comparing with the tribological behavior of GO and nano-La (OH)3 pure particles. This study provides an important theoretical basis for the application of nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites as highly effective anti-wear additives for diesel engine oil."

In this study, an HFRR produced by Jinan YiHua Tribology Testing Technology Co., Ltd., China was utilized to conduct tribological tests. The schematic of this HFRR is presented in Fig. 1. The physical indexes of the standard ball-on-disk friction pairs used are listed as follows: Balls—AISI 52100 bearing steel, φ6 mm, hardness 58–66 HRC (647–861 HV), and Ra 0.016 μm; Disk—AISI 52100 bearing steel, φ10 mm, thickness 3 mm, hardness 190–210 HV30, and Ra 0.016 μm. The tribological tests were done at different temperatures and loads for 60min under a high sliding velocity of 0.10 m/s (1000 μm stroke and 50 Hz frequency). Different concentrations of nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites were evenly and stably dispersed in diesel engine oil with 60 min of ultrasonic oscillation. As shown in Fig. 1, no clear stratification of the obtained suspensions in the centrifuge tube occurred and only a minimal amount of precipitation appeared at the tube bottom after 28 days of standing. This result demonstrated the excellent dispersion stability of nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites in diesel engine oil.\nThe average Hertz pressure of ball-on-disk contact was calculated with the Eq.

The positions and relative intensities of diffraction peaks could be found as the hexagonal phase (P63/m (176), Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards file number 36-1481) of La (OH)3 particles, which demonstrates that the La(OH)3 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized [17,29–31]. The diffraction hump appearing at 26� is attributed to the stacking of graphene sheets [32,33]. The disappearance of diffraction peaks at 11� and 42� indicates that GO was reduced to graphene after the precipitation reaction [34]. This result illustrates that the La(OH)3 nanoparticles were successfully anchored on the RGO nanosheets. Fig. 2b shows the Raman spectra of GO and nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites. The D band (1350 cm 1) attributed to the disordered carbon and G band (1580 cm 1) attributed to the sp2 carbon of graphene can be observed, respectively [35,36]. The graphitization degree of carbon materials can be defined using the ratio of intensities ID/IG. However, the ID/IG value of nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites (1.54) is slightly higher than that of the GO (1.23), which can be ascribed to the introduction of La atoms during precipitation reaction.\nFig. 3 shows the micrographs of GO sheets, nano-La(OH)3 and nanoLa(OH)3/RGO composites. As presented in Fig. 3a, the GO sheets are transparent and have a corrugated shape. Evident lamellar aggregation\nB.

Fig. 3c shows a stick-shaped structure of nano-La(OH)3 with a length of approximately 150 nm and a width of approximately 40 nm. The measured interplanar spacing is 0.319 nm and 0.327 nm (Fig. 3d). These values correspond to the lattice plane distances of (101) planes and (110) planes of hexagonal La(OH)3, respectively [31]. Fig. 3e shows the HRTEM image of nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites. Several stick-shaped nanoparticles similar to nano-La(OH)3 were attached to the GO sheets. The clear lattice fringes similar to the hexagonal La(OH)3 lattice further demonstrated that the stick-shaped nanoparticles on the GO sheets are highly crystalline nano-La(OH)3, as observed in Fig. 3f. Interestingly, nano-La(OH)3 was mostly attached uniformly at the edges and folds of the GO sheets. This observation may be attributed to the fact that more activity sites can be provided at these regions for La(OH)3 crystal growth [12]. EDS spectrum of the nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites from its HRTEM image is shown in Fig. 3g. High intensity peaks of the La appeared, further indicating that nano-La(OH)3 were successfully anchored on the GO surfaces."

The positive sign and negative sign before the terms indicate a synergistic effect and an antagonistic effect on the response, respectively [37].\nThe normal probability plots of residuals for COF and Wear were used to test the normality of the data, which are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen from the plots that the residuals are close to the straight line, revealing the errors are normally distributed [28].\nANOVA of the COF is shown in Table 4, which was used to justify the\nadequacy of the COF model.

The lack-of-fit term is not significant as the high P-value of 0.0541 and small F-value of 17.64, which further verifies that the COF model is statistically valid. Correlation coefficient R2 value can be used to evaluate the quality of the model. The developed model is well when the model R2 value near to 1, and the predicted value of the response is close to the corresponding actual value [38]. The high values of R2 (0.9903) and adjusted R2 (0.9727) of COF model illustrate the actual and predicted COF values are very closely. All these findings illustrate that the model can be further used to analyze the effect of variables on COF [39].\nANOVA result of Wear is shown in Table 5.

The high values of R2 (0.9407) and adjusted R2 (0.8338) of Wear model illustrate the actual and predicted Wear values are very closely.

According to each variable P-value shown in Table 4, temperature and load have significant effects (P < 0.05) on COF, whereas composite concentration has the least significant effect (P > 0.10). Fig. 5 shows the 3D response surface plots and 2D interaction plots, which were constructed to illustrate the effects of factors on COF.\nThe effect of temperature and load on COF is shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a and a* show that when diesel engine oil without nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites and the load is fixed at a certain value, the COF generally increases with temperature increasing from 40 �C to 80 �C. Besides, COF increases more under high load than under low load as temperature increases. This phenomenon may be due to the high temperatures cause to the diesel engine oil viscosity decrease, which leads to the less stable molecular films between the contact surfaces and the lower or breakdown of the boundary lubrication effect [41]. Haseeb et al. [42] also found that the friction coefficient of the three biodiesels increased with increasing temperature from 30 �C to 75 �C. Fig. 5a and a* as well show that when diesel engine oil without nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites and the temperature is fixed at a certain value, COF first increased with the load increasing from 1.96 N (0.95Gpa) to 7.84 N (1.51Gpa), and then exhibits a slightly decreasing tendency above 7.84 N (1.51Gpa). Since the initial lubrication state is from mixed lubrication to boundary lubrication (λ from 2.09 to 0.60), the change of COF may be attributed to\nB. Wu et al.\nTribology International 141 (2020) 105951\nB. Wu et al.\nTribology International 141 (2020) 105951\nthe lubrication regime changes from hydrodynamic region to the boundary layer lubrication region during sliding, which directly leads to the change of friction force between friction pairs [43]. Anthony et al. [27] found that for the 15W-50 diesel engine oil, a change from a low COF at 1 N to a higher COF at 10 N occurred, which remained stable to the higher loads and roughly in agreement with the variation trend of COF obtained in this study.\nThe COF of the diesel engine oil without composites presents a significant increase trend with the temperature and load increase, and the\nhigh friction coefficient appears under high temperatures and loads in particular. However, with the addition of nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites into diesel engine oil, the increasing trend of COF with the temperature and load increase slowed down, as shown in Fig. 5b and c. Fig. 5b* and c* indicate that when the temperature is above 60 �C and the load is above 5.88 N (λ <1.03, into boundary lubrication region), the COF of diesel engine oil containing nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites is lower than that of pure diesel engine oil. This phenomenon indicates that nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites can increase the adaptability of diesel engine oil to high temperature and load, and can also improve the anti-friction performance of diesel engine oil under boundary lubrication state."

Thus, temperature and load have a strong influence on the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil, which may be due to the variation of temperature and load that can change the lubrication regime of diesel engine oil. When the temperature increases, the diesel engine oil viscosity decreases and the molecular films between the contact surfaces becomes less stable. The hydrodynamic lubrication effect becomes low or breaks down, which leads to the high wear volume [41]. When the load increases, the hydrodynamic lubricant regime gradually weakens and the metal asperities gradually in contact, which also result in high wear volume [43].\nHowever, as shown in Fig. 6b and c, with the addition of nano-La (OH)3/RGO composites into diesel engine oil, the increasing trend of Wear with the temperature and load increase obviously slowed down.

This phenomenon indicates that nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites can fully guarantee the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil at different temperatures and loads, and significantly improve anti-wear performance especially under boundary lubrication state.

The results are presented in Fig. 8. As shown in the figure, the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil demonstrated evident differences after adding three types of nanoparticles at 0.1 wt%. Wear volume increased when 0.1 wt% GO was added to diesel engine oil, indicating that the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil decreased. This finding may be attributed to the corrugation effect of GO under stress during the friction process that results in energy loss and wear increase [12]. When 0.1 wt% nano-La(OH)3 was added to diesel engine oil, wear volume decreased, indicating that nano-La(OH)3 improved the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil to a certain extent. Zhao et al. also found that La(OH)3 improves the anti-wear performance of lubricating oil [17]. However, when diesel engine oil was added with 0.1 wt% nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites, wear volume significantly decreased by 44%. The result indicates that the composites can remarkably improve the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil compared with GO and nano-La (OH)3. This finding demonstrates that GO and nano-La(OH)3 exert a synergistic anti-wear effect after compound. The details of the anti-wear mechanism analysis are discussed in the following sections."

As shown in Fig. 9, the steel balls and disks exhibited various degrees of wear when different lubricants were used. The largest wear scar was observed on the steel ball and disk lubricated with diesel engine oil containing 0.1 wt % GO (Fig. 9d). Remarkable symbols of pits and deep furrows on the steel disk were observed from the optical and SEM images (Fig. 9e and f). These symbols are indicative of the abrasive wear caused by the prolonged asperity movement on the surface of friction pairs [36]. Accordingly, the wear scar on this disk is the broadest and the deepest as seen from the profile curve (Fig. 9e). When nano-La(OH)3 was used as additive for diesel engine oil, the wear scar on the steel ball and disk decreased to a certain degree compared with that with pure diesel engine oil (Fig. 9g and h). The profile curves of the worn surface also showed that the width and depth of the wear scar decreased compared with that with pure diesel engine oil (Fig. 9h). Several pits and furrows can still be observed in the SEM image (Fig. 9i). This finding is also ascribed to the abrasive wear caused by the prolonged asperity movement on the friction surface [36]. However, when the friction surface was lubricated with diesel engine oil containing 0.1 wt% nano-La (OH)3/RGO composites, the wear scar on the steel ball and disk decreased significantly compared with that with pure diesel engine oil (Fig. 9j and k). The profile curve of the worn surface presented the narrowest and shallowest wear scar compared with those of the other lubricants (Fig. 9k). As shown in the SEM image (Fig. 9l), the wear scar is even and smooth, and the pits on the surface are dramatically reduced in size and number, indicating that the nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites can evidently improve the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil. This observation may be attributed to several protective films formed on the surface of friction pairs during sliding. These films effectively prevent direct contact between steel-material friction pairs and eventually reduce the wear extent of the friction pair surface [44].\nR-square ¼ 0.9407, Adj R-Squared ¼ 0.8338. a Significant at the 5% level.\nB.

      "text" : "To explore the microstructural changes of nanoparticles, GO, nanoLa(OH)3 and nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites were cleaned several times with ethanol after the friction experiment and characterized via TEM (Fig. 10). As shown in Fig. 10a and a*, GO broke into unevenly sized pieces and became thicker. More evident corrugation was found on the pieces after friction. This phenomenon is the same as that observed by Hu et al. [45], who also found that GO undergoes such structural changes during the rubbing process. Hu et al. indicated that this finding may be attributed to the fact that after the GO nanosheets broke into unevenly sized pieces, more defect structures are generated on these pieces. These defect structures cause the agglomeration of GO pieces in all directions to form thick abrasive particles during the friction process, resulting in the severe abrasive wear of the friction pairs [45]. This result is consistent with the micrographs of the worn surface (remarkable symbols of pits and deep furrows were observed). Fig. 10b and b* show the microstructure of nano-La(OH)3 before and after friction, respectively. The La(OH)3 nanorods agglomerated into larger block particles during the friction process. These larger block La(OH)3 particles caused three-body abrasion in the friction pairs, and such abrasion increased wear volume. This finding corresponded to the evident furrow morphology on the surface of a wear scar. The microstructure of nano-La\n(OH)3/RGO composites before and after friction is shown in Fig. 10c and c*, respectively. As clearly seen from Fig. 10c*, nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites decomposed into smaller lamellar composite structures and evenly dispersed during friction testing. The enlarged image inserted into Fig. 10c* shows that these composites are composed of small sheets stacked in parallel, with several monodispersed nanorods between the lamellar layers. No apparent corrugation was found on the surface of the lamellar layers. This finding may be due to nano-La(OH)3 occupying the active sites at the edges and folds of the GO sheets, and thus effectively inhibiting the pleating effect of GO whilst preventing the agglomeration of La(OH)3 nanorods during the sliding process. This small lamellar composite structure may more easily enter friction pairs to form a protective film, and thus effectively prevent direct contact between metal asperities and significantly reduce wear. This finding is consistent with the friction testing results. Further worn surface composition analysis was conducted to investigate the anti-wear mechanism of nano-La (OH)3/RGO composites as follows."

      "text" : "The EDS results of the worn surfaces lubricated with different lubricants are provided in Table 6. As seen from Table 6, the main elements of C, O, Fe, S, P and Zn were found on the worn areas lubricated with pure diesel engine oil. Fe and C are from the steel matrix, and O may be from the oxygenated compounds in diesel engine oil [46]. S, P and Zn may come from the ZDDP additive in the diesel engine oil. When the worn areas are lubricated with diesel engine oil containing 0.1 wt% of three types of nanoparticles, an increase in O content and a decrease in Fe content were observed possibly because more Fe substrates were oxidized or formed into other compounds compared with that in pure diesel engine oil lubrication. When the worn surface was lubricated with diesel engine oil containing 0.1 wt% nano-La(OH)3, the S, P and Zn contents increased to a certain extent, indicating that nano-La(OH)3 can promote S, P and Zn to form the tribofilms on the friction surface and consequently improve the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil. This finding may be due to the unique electronic structure and high chemical activity of La in La(OH)3, which plays a catalytic role in promoting the formation of tribofilms at the friction interface [17,47]. This result is consistent with the previous reports of Zhang et al. [18], Zhao et al. [17] and Wang et al. [48], who also found that lanthanum oxide exhibits special tribological properties. However, when the worn areas were lubricated with diesel engine oil containing 0.1 wt% nano-La (OH)3/RGO composites, the S, P and Zn contents were more significantly increased, indicating that the nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites can\nB. Wu et al.\nTribology International 141 (2020) 105951\nfurther promote the formation of S, P and Zn tribofilms during sliding compared with the worn surface lubricated with diesel engine oil containing 0.1 wt% nano-La(OH)3. This finding corresponds to the friction testing results that nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites are more beneficial to improve the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil. It is may be due to the fact that nano-La(OH)3 cannot easily enter the friction interface because it agglomerates into large particles during the friction when it is added to diesel engine oil alone. This condition limits its role in promoting the formation of tribofilms at the friction interface. However, the preceding micrograph characterization of nanoparticles after friction indicated that nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites decomposed into\nsmaller lamellar composites upon friction when they were used as additive for diesel engine oil. Then, they easily entered into the friction interface and fully demonstrated the role of nano-La(OH)3 in promoting the formation of tribofilms. A higher La content on the worn surface further indicates that more nano-La(OH)3 has entered into the friction interface.\nTo explore the formation of graphene film in friction pairs, Raman mappings of the worn surfaces lubricated with diesel engine oil containing 0.1 wt% GO and diesel engine oil containing 0.1 wt% nano-La (OH)3/RGO composites are shown in Fig. 11. When nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites were used as additive for diesel engine oil, a large number of\nB. Wu et al.\nTribology International 141 (2020) 105951\nstrong G (1580 cm 1) characteristic peak distributions of graphene were evidently observed on the worn surface (Fig. 11b). By contrast, when GO was used as additive, the G characteristic peak distribution was extremely small and weak (Fig. 11a). This finding indicates that compared with GO, nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites can more effectively enter into the friction interface to form graphene protective films on worn surface during sliding. Thus, the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil is significantly improved. This finding also verified the morphological analysis results that nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites can more easily enter into the metal asperities during sliding because they are decomposed into small lamellar composite structures.\nTo further investigate the composition of tribofilms on the worn surfaces, XPS spectra of the worn surfaces lubricated with diesel engine oil and diesel engine oil containing 0.1 wt% nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites are presented in Fig. 12. The survey scan XPS spectra of the worn surfaces are shown in Fig. 12a. As illustrated in the figure, the characteristic peaks of C1s, O1s, Fe2p, S2p, P2p and Zn2p were detected on the worn surfaces lubricated with pure diesel engine oil and diesel engine oil containing 0.1 wt% nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites. The new characteristic peaks of La3d were detected when nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites were added to diesel engine oil to lubricate the worn surface.\nFig. 12b shows the XPS spectra of C1s on the worn surface. The peaks at 284.7 (peak 1), 285.4 (peak 2) and 288.9 (peak 3) eV belong to C–C or C–C, C–O and C–O compounds, respectively [49]. This finding indicates that several organic compounds from diesel engine oil are adsorbed onto the worn surface to form the tribofilms. In general, the area ratio of the characteristic peak can reflect the relative contents of\nthe chemical components under the same conditions. When nano-La (OH)3/RGO composites were added to diesel engine oil, the relative peak area of C–C or C–C increased to a certain extent. This phenomenon may be caused by graphene entering the friction interface to form tribofilms.\nFig. 12c and d shows the XPS spectra of P2p and S2p on the worn surface, respectively. The characteristic peak areas of P 2p3/2 (peak at 133.2 eV) and S 2p3/2 (peak at 161.7 eV) were significantly enhanced when nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites were added to diesel engine oil, indicating that more P and S tribofilms were generated on the worn surface [50].\nFig. 12e presents the XPS spectra of O1s on the worn surface. As seen in Fig. 12e, the peak at 530.1eV (peak 1) belongs to metal oxide (Fe–O, Zn–O or La–O) [51]. The peak at 531.2eV (peak 2) belongs to C–O and C–O [52]. The peak at 532.0eV (peak 3) belongs to P–O [52–54]. The relative peak area of the O compound showed that more P–O compounds were generated on the worn surface after adding nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites to diesel engine oil. This finding may be attributed to the fact that nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites can promote the formation of metal phosphate tribofilms on a worn surface. Cui et al. [53] and Cen et al. [55] reported that metal phosphate can act as an excellent anti-wear agent on friction pairs. This information is consistent with our friction testing results. Fig. 12f shows the XPS spectra of Zn2p on the worn surface. The peaks at 1021.7 (peak 1) and 1022. 4 (peak 2) eV belong to ZnO and zinc phosphate, respectively [52,56]. The relative content of zinc phosphate increased evidently when nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites were added to diesel engine oil, further proving that the composites\nB. Wu et al.\nTribology International 141 (2020) 105951\ncan effectively promote the formation of phosphate compounds with good anti-wear performance on friction pairs.\nFig. 12g shows the XPS spectra of Fe2p on the worn surface. The peaks at 709.8 (peak 1), 710.8 (peak 2) and 711.5 (peak 3) eV are belong to FeO, Fe2O3 and FeOOH, respectively [57], and the peaks at 712.1 (peak 4) and 712.8 (peak 5) eV are belong to FeS and FePO4, respectively [57,58]. When nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites were added to diesel engine oil, the relative content of Fe–O decreased and that of FeS increased remarkably, indicating that more FeS tribofilms were formed on the worn surface and played a certain anti-wear role. Fig. 12h shows the XPS spectra of La3d on the worn surface. The new peaks at 835.1 (peak 1) and 836.1 (peak 2) eV after adding nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites to the diesel engine oil belong to La2O3 and LaPO4 [15,18,59], respectively. This finding indicated that La entered the friction interfaces and promoted the formation of tribofilms on the worn surface. Zhao et al. and Wang et al. also found that La plays a catalytic role in lubricants by promoting the formation of tribofilms in the friction process and thus reducing wear and friction [17,47,48]."

From the preceding characterization analysis of the worn surfaces lubricated with diesel engine oil and diesel engine oil containing 0.1 wt% of three types of nanoparticles, the anti-wear mechanism model of nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites was hypothesised. When friction pairs were lubricated with pure diesel engine oil, numerous pits and furrows were generated on the steel surface due to the direct contact between metal asperities under high loads. When GO was added to diesel engine oil, agglomeration and corrugation phenomena were prone to occur during sliding, leading to the worn aggravation of friction pairs (Fig. 13a). When nano-La(OH)3 was added to diesel engine oil, nano-La(OH)3 promoted the formation of S, P and Zn tribofilms on the friction surface and improved the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil to a certain extent. However, nano-La(OH)3 also tends to agglomerate into large particles during sliding, resulting in\ncertain abrasive wear at the friction interface and inhibiting its good anti-wear performance (Fig. 13b). However, when nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites were added to diesel engine oil, the composites were first decomposed into smaller lamellar composites and effectively entered the friction interface during friction. Subsequently, the smaller lamellar composites formed the tribofilms of graphene and lanthanum oxide at the friction interface. These films effectively prevented direct contact between metal asperities and reduced the wear of the worn surface. Simultaneously, lanthanum oxide played a catalytic role at the friction interface, promoting the generation of more metal phosphate and sulphide anti-wear tribofilms at the friction interface. Lastly, anti-wear performance was further improved under the synergistic effect of graphene and lanthanum oxide (Fig. 13c)."

    "abstractText" : "Nano-lanthanum hydroxide/reduced graphene oxide (nano-La(OH)3/RGO) composites were successfully prepared as anti-wear additives for diesel engine oil. Response surface methodology was adopted to explore the influences of temperature, contact pressure, and composite concentration on the tribological properties of diesel engine oil. The anti-wear mechanism of nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites was simultaneously studied by comparing with the tribological behavior of graphene oxide and nano-La(OH)3 pure particles. Results indicate that nano-La(OH)3/RGO composites can remarkably improve the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil under boundary lubrication conditions. In particular, the anti-wear performance of diesel engine oil increased by 44% after adding 0.1 wt% composites at a temperature of 80 C and a contact pressure of 1.62 GPa. The synergistic anti-wear mechanism of graphene and lanthanum oxide was proposed on the basis of worn surface",
