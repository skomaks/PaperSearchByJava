      "text" : "Water contamination as the most environmental pollution is a menace to the health of the living organisms. Dyes have a vital role in different industries such as printing, photography, textile, etc. It is estimated 100000 commercial dyes are used in various industrial processes. Approximately 5e15% of synthetic dyes are released in ecosystem and water ways. Also, 120e180 L of water is used for dyeing and finishing of 1 kg of cloth. In a study, 4000 dyes were tested for determining their LD50 values. The results showed that 90% of dyes had the LD50 greater than 2 g/Kg (Ajmal et al., 2014; Anliker, 1979; Mahmoodi, 2013; Mahmoodi, 2014b; Pramod Gopinathan Nair et al., 1996). In addition, dyes are highly visible even at the very low concentration (0.005mg/L) in a natural stream (Yincan et al., 2017). Several processes including chemical, physical and biological are used for removing contaminants fromwater and wastewater (Aliabadi and Mahmoodi, 2018; Keci c et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Mahmoodi, 2014a; Mahmoodi et al., 2014; Mahmoodi and Arami, 2009; Maleki et al., 2016; Nasiri and Arsalani, 2018;\nnm_mahmoodi@aut.ac.ir\nShen et al., 2018; Vellingiri et al., 2018). Each of the abovementioned methods has advantages and disadvantages. Traditional physical process including membrane and adsorption techniques easily transfer the pollutant from one phase to another media and cause secondary pollution which requires additional treatment. Several materials were used in different fields such as adsorbents and surface modifiers (Davarpanah et al., 2009; Mahmoodi et al., 2011; Ranjbar-Mohammadi et al., 2010){RanjbarMohammadi et al. (2010) #182}. The chemical processes such as ozonation are applied for treating different contaminants from aqueous media. These processes can degrade organic pollutants and produce the innocuous products (Ghosal et al., 2013). Biological methods as economical processes for removing organic pollutants are carried out by living organisms. However, they are inactive in toxic and carcinogenic media. Membrane bioreactor is an alternative process for reusing water applications because of compact size and high removal efficiency. However, membrane fouling is as a major limitation, which considerably increases the operational costs (Sepehri and Sarrafzadeh, 2018). Recently, researchers focus on the processes with higher efficiency for treating pollutants from aquatic media using novel materials (Ajmal et al., 2014, P. Pizarro et al., 2005).\nAdvanced oxidation process (AOP) is an effective method based on very reactive species such as hydroxyl radical (OH ) for treating and purifying contaminated water bodies. Scientists have studied different AOPs including photocatalysis, photo-Fenton, and photoozonation to degrade pollutants. The OH has high oxidation potential (2.8 eV) which reacts with organic contaminants and mineralized them to non-toxic compounds. The significant important step during the catalytic process is adsorption of pollutants. Thus, the catalyst with higher adsorption capacity is attracted much attention to decompose pollutants. Several nanomaterials including titania, zinc oxide, and cadmium sulphide were used as photocatalysts for degrading contaminants. During the photocatalytic process, contaminants diffused from the bulk solution to the surface of the catalyst and adsorbed on it. Then they are degraded by light irradiation on active surface sites (Ghosal et al., 2013; Lin and Chang, 2014; Mahmoodi et al., 2007; Nidheesh et al., 2014; Nidheesh and Rajan 2016; Rashid et al., 2015). Between nanomaterials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are significant and serious members of the investigation region. Also, these nanoporous materials are one of the most extensively investigated types of compounds that are organized via the assembly of inorganic metal ions or cluster centers and organic bridging ligands (Ata ur et al., 2018; Sanchez-Sanchez et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2018). These nanomaterials have been known to dominate themethod restrictions of formal porous and nano-based substance for environmental usages (Kumar et al., 2018). MOFs have some good characteristics such as high surface area, tuneable surface properties, unsaturated metal sites, textural properties, pore size and geometry that make them useful in various research areas including drug delivery, adsorption, storage and purification of gases, and separation (Abdelhamid and Zou, 2018; Ata ur et al., 2018; Avci-Camur et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2014; Deng et al., 2015; Gong et al., 2016; Mahmoodi et al., 2018; Oveisi et al., 2018; Pi et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016). These materials are used for photocatalytic decomposition of contaminants (Table 1).\nAmong all MOFs reported, MIL-Fe is a particularly promising compound for photocatalytic performance because Fe (III)-oxide can be quickly excited by visible irradiation (Xu et al., 2017). MIL100(Fe) has many unsaturated metal sites, high surface area, and good hydrothermal resistance. In addition, it has two kinds of the cage (mesoporous) that are available with windows (microporous) (Han et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018;WitriWahyu Lestari et al., 2016). Thus, the synthesis of MIL100(Fe) has been an interesting field for scientists. There are many ways to the synthesis of it such\nas hydrothermal, microwave, room temperature, etc. Some of the synthesis procedures have to take care of the obstacles such as low autoclave accessibility and contamination resulted from the usage of a wide range of hazardous solvents. Thus, finding a way to get straightforward, great efficiency and green synthesis path are under review (Han et al., 2017). Moreover, incorporating MOFs with diversity substances has been suggested to mix competence and relieve a deficiency of both of them that attributes distinct from each of them alone. As a result, the composite has a synergistic effect that creates appropriately for various uses (Abednatanzi et al. 2016, 2017; Zhu and Xu, 2014). The MOF composites can be made via metal nanoparticles, polymers, graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), etc. (Li and Huo, 2015;Mahmoodi et al., 2019). Amongmetal oxide nanoparticles, titania has much attention to widely used on environmental applications because of its high activity, chemical resistance, low poisonous, stable, reasonably inexpensive and comparatively ordinary to product and apply. Nevertheless, some inherent disadvantages of it are broad band gap, charge bearer recombination, the low adsorption capacity of hydrophobic pollutants, high aggregation trend and the obstacle of separation and reuse which limits their photocatalytic performance. Therefore, many works have been done to remove restrictions of titania (Dong et al., 2015).\nThe titania fiber exhibits good application in wastewater treatment owing to its simple reusability. The one dimensional (1D) titania nanostructures have better routs for charge transport than the zero dimensional (0D) titania nanoparticles (NPs). It was prepared via electrospinning method (Albetran et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2008).\nThe cleaner production of MIL in a sustainable way includes room temperature, the application of cheap and harmless solvents, and short synthesis times without harmful by-products. In this work, MIL-Fe metal-organic framework was coated on titania inorganic nanofiber using the green method at ambient temperature and pressure. A literature review presented that the facile and green synthesis of MIL-Fe metal-organic framework/inorganic nanofibers using electrospinning technique for recyclable visiblelight photocatalysis was not carried out. Herein, inorganic nanofiber (titania nanofiber: TNF) was synthesized using the electrospinning method. In addition, the synthesis of MIL100 and its nanocomposites with different TNF amounts (0.05, 0.07 and 0.09 g denoted as MIL100/TNF5, MIL100/TNF7 and MIL100/TNF9) has been developed using a facile and green method at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The synthesized nanomaterials\nwere characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, BET, TGA, AFM, PL, EDS, DLS and zeta potential. They were used for visible-light photocatalytic degradation of Methylene Blue (MB). Dye decolorization kinetics, reusability, and stability over five cycles of the catalysts were studied in details."

      "text" : "The morphology of the synthesized samples is illustrated by SEM. Fig. 3a showed the morphology of raw titania/PVA nanofiber when it was not calcinated. The nanofibers had no bead deficiency with smooth surfaces. SEM image of the fiber after calcination showed that its size was <100 nm (Fig. 3b). The morphology of the MIL100 in Fig. 3 showed uniform octahedral particles. The images indicated that the octahedral shape of MIL100(Fe) remained when made shell on TNF and produced the MIL100/TNF photocatalysts (Wang et al., 2016b).\nTo further comprehend the morphology and size of the MIL100/ TNF coreeshell, the photocatalyst was studied with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 4). The TEM images show that the TNF is well encapsulated in the MIL100 as a core-shell structure. The thickness of MIL100 shell is< 100 nm. The TEM demonstrated that theMIL100/TNF is containing TNF cores with nearly 25 nm and a MIL100 shell.\nAFM was used to obtain the surface topography of catalysts (Zeng and Tan, 2017). The two and three-dimensional AFM images of the fiber including TNF, andMIL100/TNFs are shown in Fig. 5. The images indicated that the thickness of TNF became higher than the raw fiber surface due to the MIL grown on its surface. The schemes of the AFM are consistent with the SEM images (Fig. 3) of the nanomaterials.\nDynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement of MIL100 (dispersed in ethanol) indicated diameters ranging from 22 to 72 nm, in accord with TEM images (Fig. 4). Fig. 6 shows that the size distribution of MIL100 is 22.8 nm.\nFig. 7 displays the FTIR spectra of TNF, MIL100, MIL100/TNF5, MIL100/TNF7 and MIL100/TNF9. Water can be easily adsorbed by TNF. The broad peak at 3434 cm 1 is ascribed to the stretching of the hydroxyl group on the TNF surface, which exhibited the presence of H2O. The peak observed at 1629 cm 1 was related to\nHeOeH bending vibrations (Fig. 7a) (Ali et al., 2017; Li et al., 2005; Lopez et al., 2002; Nagaveni et al., 2004; Riaz et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2011; Vishwanath et al., 2017; Yoong et al., 2009). The specific absorption peaks of the MIL100 (Fig. 7b) are illustrated at 1624, 1574, 1443, 1381, 762 and 711 cm 1. The peaks at 762 and 711 cm 1 are attributed to C-H bending vibrations of benzene. The strong vibration at 1624 cm 1 can be ascribed to the interaction between the Fe ion and the COOH (Hu et al., 2016). The asymmetric and symmetric vibrational bands of the -O-C-O- group were attributed at 1443 and 1381 cm 1 (Lv et al., 2015; Tang and Wang, 2017). The FTIR spectra of the MIL100/TNF5, MIL100/TNF7, and MIL100/TNF9 nanocomposites were shown in Fig. 7c, d, and e, respectively. The data indicated that the peaks of the nanocomposites were the same as the MIL100. It can be attributed that the MIL100 nanocrystals homogenously grow on the titania nanofiber to produce core (TNF)-shell (MIL100) nanocomposite.\nTo investigate the structure of the nanomaterials, the XRD diffraction pattern of TNF, MIL100 and MIL100/TNFs were obtained and the consequences were displayed in Fig. 8. The XRD of TNF indicates that the diffraction peaks could be determined to anatasephase TNF at 2q values of 25, 38, 48, 54, 55, and 63 . Thus, the pattern illustrates that a calcination temperature at 450 C leads to only anatase structure (Ahmed et al., 2013; Zheng and Zhu, 2018). The diffraction peaks of MIL100 conform to a formerly report (Fig. 8). The diffraction peaks of the MOF indicate low crystallinity because of the HF absence in the synthesis of MIL. In addition, no further peaks were observed, indicating that no additional crystalline products were synthesized (Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017; Seo et al., 2012). In addition, Fig. 8 displays the XRD patterns of the MIL100/TNFs nanocomposite catalysts. Each peak in the MIL100/ TNF pattern can be well attributed to the diffraction peaks of MIL100 and TNF. All MIL100/TNFs have similar diffraction peaks of MIL100, showing that the crystal structure of the MIL100 (Fe) preserves after shelling around TNF core. However, the crystallinity of MIL100 slightly reduces after the encapsulating of TNF. Due to the high dispersion of TNF and the powerful covering efficacy of MIL100 on the surface of TNF, the diffraction peaks showing titania approximately vanished. These consequences represented that MIL100/TNF was successfully synthesized (Aslam et al., 2017; Han et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017; Seo et al., 2012).\nTo study the porosity of MIL100 and MIL100/TNFs, the BET analysis was carried out. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of MIL100, MIL100/TNF5, MIL100/TNF7, MIL100/TNF9, and TNF was measured as 673, 1056, 1194, 1188, and 64m2/g by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Fig. 9 and Table 2). The total pore volume of TNF, MIL100, and MIL100/TNF7 was 0.1332, 0.3334, and 0.5551 cm3/g, respectively. In addition, the mean pore diameter of TNF, MIL100, and MIL100/TNF7 was 8.3161, 2.1628, and 1.8582 nm, respectively. The results show that the addition of TNF can importantly affect the surface of theMOF. The higher surface area of catalyst provides more active sites and enhances charge carriers transport and photocatalytic efficiency. Thus, MIL100 in the synthesized composites plays the key role for increasing the photocatalytic activity.\nOn the basis of the XRD, SEM, FTIR, and N2 adsorption results, it may be concluded that MIL100 and MIL100/TNF could be successfully synthesized via the method developed in this context.\nThe TGA as an analytical method is used to measure the thermal stability of nanomaterials. The thermal resistance of MIL100 and MIL100/TNF7 was investigated via TGA, and the conclusions were shown in Fig. 10. There are three weight loss steps between 25 and 600 C. The first stage from 25 to 100 C is due to desorption of water molecules inside the pores. The second stage of the weight loss in the range of 100e330 C is because of desorption of the\ncoordinated water to the Fe trimers. The collapse of the MIL100 framework occurred in the terminal step, between 330 and 500 C, was attributed to the H3BTC dissociation.\nThe EDS spectra (Fig. 11) revealed the existence of metal Ti for TNF, Fe for MIL100, and Fe and Ti for MIL100/TNF7. Fig. 11a did not present the N in titania nanofiber through the EDS analysis because the nanofiber was calcined at 450 C and nitrogenwas converted to the gaseous species. The tight interaction between the TNF and MIL100 increases the photocatalytic activity.\nFig. 12 illustrates the value of zeta potential of MIL100, TNF and MIL100/TNF7 at pH 6.30. Colloidal dispersions were prepared in a concentration of 0.06 g/L of MIL100, TNF and MIL100/TNF7 by sonicating for 20min. The supernatant was taken and used for the experimental measurements. An approximately zero mobility for TNF is observed at around pH 6.30. When zeta potential reaches to zero value, the repulsion between the catalyst particles is negligible and they are agglomerated. In addition, the particles are stabilized at higher zeta values (Jastrzębska et al., 2016). The zeta potential of MIL100 is lower than that of TNF over the natural pH. The zeta potential of nanocomposite is negative, which is as the same as the zeta potential of pure MIL100.\nThe PL spectrum was applied to study the transfer and separation efficiency of photo-generated electronehole pairs. The lower PL intensity is due to lower recombination of photo-induced charge carriers. The data of the PL spectra presented the addition of MOF on the TNF surface decreases the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole. To further study the superiority of MIL100/TNF, the PL spectra for 393 nm excitation value were obtained for TNF, MIL100/TNF and MIL100 (Fig. 13). It was clear that MIL100/TNF7 exhibited a lower emission intensity than that of TNF and MIL100. The PL emission intensity presents the recombination rate of the excited electrons and holes. Thus, the lower emission intensity is attributed to the lower recombination rate (Choi et al., 2010)."

MIL100/TNF decolorization ability via H2O2 without light is very (29%) (100mL of dye solution (50mg/L) and MIL100/TNF: 0.006g). Thus, its dye degradation ability with light irradiation was studied.\nThe pollutant degradation using light and H2O2 in the absence of photocatalyst is 20% for MB (Fig. 14). The control tests were further performed in the presence of MB and light, where the bleaching degree of MB was about 1.14%.\nIt is observed that MIL100/TNF/light/H2O2 yielded a significant decolorization compared to the light alone (Fig. 14). The generation of free radicals including hydroxyl radical increases byMIL100/TNF/ light/H2O2 and the degradation of pollutants in the aqueous phase increases (Eqs. (1)e(5)). When the electron (e )-hole (hþ) pairs are produced, the photocatalytic reaction begins.

The photocatalytic dye degradation increases with catalyst dosage due to the enhancement of surface area and active sites.\nThe MB removal by 0.003, 0.004, 0.005, and 0.006 g of catalyst was 39.80, 54.96, 63.31, and 72.10% for bare MIL100 and 25.50, 26.81, 29.23, and 35.62% for TNF after 90min of adsorption time.\nThe data represented that the photocatalytic reaction increased with the MIL100/TNF7 mass increasing from 0.003 g to 0.006 g (46.42, 70.85, 88.3, 97.96 and 99.40% for 0.003, 0.004, 0.005, and 0.006 g of catalyst, respectively). The MIL100/TNF7 nanocomposite has the best photocatalytic degradation activity. When the TNF mass percent in the composites is further added to 0.09 g, the catalytic activity of the catalysts diminishes. It results from the\noptimum content of every constituent of the composite. However, the increase or decrease of MOF content affects the interface of the composite in TNF.\nSeveral decolorization kinetic models including zero-order (Fig. 15), first-order (Fig. 16) and second-order (Fig. 17) models were studied at different catalyst dosages (Table 3). The rate constants of decolorization (k0, k1 and k2) and correlation coefficient (R2) for various dosages of catalysts were shown in Table 3.\nThe results (Figs. 15e17) presented that dye decolorization by MIL100/TNFs obeyed the first-order kinetic. It means that dye\ndecolorization depends on catalyst dosage. The MB degradation rate using photocatalysts (0.006 g) was 0.0239 (MIL100), 0.0131 (TNF), 0.0259 (MIL100/TNF5), 0.0351 (MIL100/TNF7), and 0.031 (MIL100/TNF9) for k0 (mg/L. min), 0.009 (MIL100), 0.003 (TNF), 0.010 (MIL100/TNF5), 0.031 (MIL100/TNF7), 0.016 (MIL100/TNF9) for k1 (1/min) and 0.0027 (MIL100), 0.0006 (TNF), 0.0041 (MIL100/ TNF5), 0.1698 (MIL100/TNF7), 0.0019 (MIL100/TNF9) for k2 (L/mg. min)."

Fig. 18 showed the decolorization percentages at different contaminant concentrations. The decreasing of the photocatalytic degradation yield was observed when the primary organic pollutant concentration was enhanced. It can be attributed to the more adsorption of contaminant on the catalyst surface and the interference of intermediates during parental contaminant destruction. Also, the number of absorbed photons was reduced with increasing dye molecules. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized catalysts reduced."

      "text" : "Herein, several photocatalysts including TNF, MIL100, MIL100/ TNF5, MIL100/TNF7 and MIL100/TNF9 were used for decontaminating colored wastewater. Based on the achieved results in this research, a possible decomposition mechanism by the synthesized catalyst was proposed to clarify the higher catalytic activity of MIL100/TNF nanocomposite. The degradation ability of photocatalyst depends on the various parameters such as surface area, porosity, and lattice mismatch. The surface area is one of the most important factors for decolorization reaction, which enhances its rate (Akpan and Hameed, 2009).\nOne-dimensional catalysts including TNF attracted much attention due to their unique properties including high surface to volume ratio and significant e -hþ utilization, which enhances the catalytic activity. Therefore, we synthesized and applied TNF as a one dimensional (1D) photocatalyst nanomaterial. Photodecomposition of organic pollutant by TNF is studied by photoexcitation of catalyst and e -hþ generation on its surface. Organic contaminant can be directly degraded by e -hþ in catalyst. Different reactive\nspecies such as hydroxyl radical can be generated to degrade different organics.\nThe porosity of MIL100 enhances the diffusion of pollutants through MOF channels and makes it an ideal bed for photocatalytic centre (Zhang and Lin, 2014).\nThe remediation of organics by MOFs can be occurred through three steps including (1) the excitation of organic linker to produce the e -hþ pair (2) the separation and movement of e -hþ to reactive sites, and (3) the reduction and oxidation reaction by e -hþ at the catalyst surface.\nIn this research, MIL100was used as pureMOF. The Fe (ІІІ) of the MIL100 generates OHº via H2O2 decomposition through the Fenton like reaction (Eqs. (6) and (7)).\nFeðІІІÞ þ H2O2/FeðІІÞ þ HOο2 þ Hþ (6)\nFeðІІÞ þ H2O2/FeðІІІÞ þ OH þ OH (7)\nIn addition, H2O2 can effectively scavenge the produced electron via the irradiation of the MIL100 to generate OHº radicals (Eqs. (8) and (9)) (Ai et al., 2014).\nMIL100þ hy/hþ þ e (8)\nH2O2 þ e ðMIL100 ðFeÞÞ/OH þ OH (9)\nThe catalyst doping enhances the catalytic activity via different ways such as decreasing band gap, high surface area for contaminant adsorption, trap of generated electron, etc.\nMOF in composite adsorbs large amount of organic pollutant such as MB due to high its surface area which facilities the photocatalytic reactions. In addition, TNF and MIL100 cages in their composite are able to contact with more pollutants to enhance the catalyst activity. Further, the e -hþ recombination in MIL100/TNF decreased and large amount of charge carries enhance the degradation rate (Huang et al., 2017)."

The catalyst (MIL100/TNF7) was added to 100mL of MB (50mg/L) solution and degradation experiments were carried out. After decolorization, it was rinsed with ethanol. Then, the recovered catalyst was reused for another dye degradation in succeeding five cycles. Pollutant destruction by the regenerated MOF for first, second, third, fourth and fifth cycles was\n95, 93, 92, 90 and 89%, respectively.

The TNF inorganic nanofiber was synthesized using electrospinning method. The XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, BET, TGA, AFM, PL, EDS, DLS and zeta potential were used for characterizing nanomaterials. They were used for degrading Methylene Blue (MB) as an organic pollutant by visible-light photocatalysis. The surface area of MIL100/TNF7 was 1194.48m2/g. The morphology of the MIL100 indicated uniform octahedral particles. Also, the MIL100 nanocrystals homogenously grown on the titania nanofiber to produce core (TNF)-shell (MIL100) nanocomposite. The data show that the addition of TNF affects the surface of theMIL and enhances charge carriers transport and photocatalytic activity. The EDS spectra of nanocomposite presented the existence of metal Ti for TNF, Fe for MIL100, and Fe and Ti elements for MIL100/TNF7. The PL spectrum showed that the lower emission intensity was attributed to the lower recombination rate. The results indicated that dye degradation decreased when pollutant concentration increased because of the interference of intermediates formed during parental dye molecules degradation. The dye decolorization at different catalyst dosages including 0.003, 0.004, 0.005, and 0.006 g was 39.80, 54.96, 63.31, and 72.10% for MIL100, 25.50, 26.81, 29.23, and 35.62% for TNF and 46.42, 70.85, 88.3, 97.96 and 99.40% for MIL100/TNF7, respectively. The data represented that the photocatalytic reaction increased with the mass increasing from\n0.003 g to 0.006 g. The MIL100/TNF7 nanocomposite degraded MB within 150min after 90min adsorption of the catalyst. Dye degradation followed first-order kinetics. The MIL100/TNF7 nanocomposite had high regeneration and stability over five cycles.\nAbbreviation:\nBET Brunauer-Emmett-Teller DLS Dynamic Light Scattering EDS Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy FTIR Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy PL Photoluminescence SEM Scanning electron microscopy TEM Transmission electron microscopy TGA Thermogravimetric analysis MIL Materials Institute Lavoisiers TNF Titania nanofiber MOF metal-organic framework"

    "abstractText" : "Herein, Fe based metal-organic framework (Materials Institute Lavoisier: MIL100) and its nanocomposites with different titania nanofiber (TNF) amounts (0.05, 0.07 and 0.09 g denoted as MIL100/ TNF5, MIL100/TNF7 and MIL100/TNF9) were synthesized using a facile and green procedure at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The TNF inorganic nanofiber was synthesized using the electrospinning method. The nanomaterials were fully characterized. They were used for visible-light photocatalytic degradation of Methylene Blue (MB). The surface area of MIL100/TNF7 was 1194.48m2/g. The data indicated the MIL100 diameters ranging from 22 to 72 nm. The decolorization percentage of the synthesized materials at different dosages including 0.003, 0.004, 0.005, and 0.006 g was 39.80, 54.96, 63.31, and 72.10% for MIL100, 25.50, 26.81, 29.23, and 35.62% for TNF and 46.42, 70.85, 88.3, 97.96 and 99.40% for MIL100/TNF7, respectively. The MIL100/TNF7 nanomaterial had higher dye degradation ability, reusability, and stability over five cycles. Dye degradation followed first-order kinetics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
