The magnetite nanoparticles were synthesized through a controlled co-precipitation technique and were stabilized with citric acid. Subsequently, they were covalently bonded to chitosan via carbodiimide chemistry using EDAC/NHS activation. One of the notable advantages of this nano-biocomposite is its chemical conjugation, which does not have the weakness of the ultimate chitosan detachment of a physical bond and makes it an encouraging candidate for magnetic separationwith no secondary waste production. The CH-MNPs had a diameter of ~10 nm, with a saturation magnetization of 76.01 emu/g ensuring a superparamagnetic property. The response surface methodology (RSM) with a central composite design (CCD) framework was used for optimizing the adsorption process. The optimum conditions to achieve 92.15% of Pb(II) removal were found to be at a pH of 6.1 with the nano-adsorbent concentration of 1.04 g/L and a contact time of 59.92 min. Our adsorption isotherm data were fitted well with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, and the equilibrium data followed the pseudo-second-order kinetics and intraparticle diffusion kinetic model. The maximum Langmuir Pb(II) adsorption capacity was calculated to be 192.308 mg/g. These results suggest that the proposed synthetic nano-biocomposite is quite an ideal nano-adsorbent for Pb(II) removal in wastewater treatment technology.\n© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Nowadays, water pollution is a global problem causing critical concerns in developing countries (Xu et al., 2012). One of the most\nimportant contaminants in industrial wastewater is heavy metals ions, which accumulate in the environment, and can also get into living organs through the food chain and consequently threaten human health (Bagheri et al., 2015). Hence, environmental organizations and industries are searching for new methods of treating industrial wastewater.\nHeavy metal ions are highly toxic even in relatively small contents. Among them, Pb(II) has been classified as the biggest three hazardous elements as well as Hg and Cd with environmental risks (Ali Khan Rao and Khatoon, 2017). Pb(II) is considered as a carcinogenic heavymetal, causing awide range of health issues, such as: neonatal mortality, abortions, cancer, renal failure, convulsions, and serious damage to the central nervous system (Shaker and Yakout, 2016; Rehman et al., 2008). The clean water standard for the total lead is 15 parts per billion, as reported by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Who, 2011). In the last few years, several approaches have been used to remove the Pb(II) from contaminated water (Who, 2011; Ghaedi et al., 2009; Uluozlu et al., 2010). Among all methods, adsorption has beenwidely employed for contaminant removal for water treatment, due to its simplicity, low cost, applicability in a wide range of pH and capability of metal-binding (Bagheri et al., 2015). Moreover, selecting a suitable adsorbent is essential (Rao et al., 2007). Among the various adsorbents, the magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) have gained great importance, due to their particular properties, including high surface to volume ratio, attractive magnetic characteristic contributing to a higher adsorption capability, and easier separation for water purification. Magnetite nano-adsorbent after the adsorption procedure can be parted from the medium by using the magnetic separation method (Tan et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016;Ma et al., 2015; Paulino et al., 2011; Dave and Chopda, 2014; Neyaz et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2015; Ziegler-Borowska et al., 2014; Cheraghipour and Javadpour, 2013).\nUnmodified MNPs tend to form an aggregation in an aqueous medium and also oxidize in the air through their high chemical activity and magnetic property, generally ending up into the losing of dispersibility and magnetism (li et al., 2008a). Therefore, it is essential to apply the stabilizers (li et al., 2008a; li et al., 2008b). These stabilizers can be easily coated or grafted with organic molecules to stabilize and modify MNPs with favorable functional groups and also behave like chelating ligand (Nasirimoghaddam et al., 2015; Banerjee and Chen, 2007). Chitosan is a natural adsorbent that has attracted significant attention because of its particular characteristics such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, availability, toxicity inadequacy, hydrophilicity, anti-bacterial, anti-oxidation, and adsorption properties (Ngah et al., 2005; Reddy and Lee, 2013). Chitosan is a polymeric substance and cationic polysaccharide extracted from chitin (Younes and Rinaudo, 2015). It can be used to conjugate onto the MNP surface to fabricate magnetic nano-adsorbents because of the attendance of several free amine groups in the matrix of the polymer (Ngah et al., 2011; Rosa et al., 2008), which may serve as chelation sites and interact with metals ion through complexation reactions and ion exchange (Guibal, 2004). Moreover, the chemical modification of chitosan effectively enhances the adsorption ability of magnetic nanoparticles (Mi et al., 2015). It is important to prepare chitosan conjugated MNPs via the cross-linking agents to minimize the environmental damages. The traditionally employed chemical conjugation reagent, i.e. glutaraldehyde, is very toxic and may generate secondary wastes and ecological contamination (Mi et al., 2015; Ballantyne et al., 1997). Hence, a carbodiimide crosslinker has been chosen to bind chitosan onto MNPs via carbodiimide activation chemistry covalently. Furthermore, due to the intramolecular interactions between eCOOH group of MNP and eNH2 group of chitosan, the -NH3þ groups can increases, resulting\nin an enhancement of the adsorption properties of chitosan conjugated MNP. To reach the best condition for the adsorption, removal should be performed at the optimum experimental condition. In the recent years, one of the greatest successful techniques to study the simultaneous consequences of important variables is the statistical response surface methodology (RSM) technique (Vinoth kumar et al., 2011; Raissi and Farsani, 2009; Myers et al., 2016; Khataee et al., 2011; Ahmadi et al., 2005). RSM is a numerical protocol for optimization of effective parameters, which costeffectively limits the series of experiments. RSM also can contribute to recognizing the effect of the interaction of the different parameters on the result, while they are changed together.\nPrevious studies not only have examined the use of chitosancoated MNPs to remove heavy metals from water pollution, but also have gained interest (Nasirimoghaddam et al., 2015; Mi et al., 2015; Ballantyne et al., 1997). Recently, some studies have investigated chitosan chemically conjugated MNPs as an adsorbent (Li et al., 2013; Cho et al., 2012; Sikder et al., 2014; Song et al., 2015). However, this study is the first report regarding the combination of chemical conjugations of chitosan onto MNPs via carbodiimide chemistry and the benefit of the RSM technique to modeling and optimizing effective variables involved in the adsorption procedure. Moreover, it recognizes the interaction effects of different parameters on the adsorption."

In a typical reaction, 1.35 g of iron (II) chloride tetrahydrate and 3.68 g of iron (III) chloride hexahydrate were solved in ultrapure water (40 ml). Afterwards, it was mixed using a mechanical stirrer under refluxing condition. Then, 20ml of ammonium hydroxide solutionwas added dropwise to the mixing solution. The resulting suspension was further stirred for another 30 min, and pH was kept at 10. After the synthesis was completed, the nanoparticles were collected magnetically and thenwere washed triplicate with ultrapure water and finally freeze-dried for subsequent use."

The stabilization of the MNPs was through incubating citric acid via a direct addition process. Briefly, the MNPs suspension was incubated in\n0.5 g/mL of citric acid solvent (2 mL) for 60 min and the temperature was gradually increased to 90 C. Finally, the resultant reaction mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm, then washed three times, and as a final point freeze-dried (Cheraghipour and Javadpour, 2013), (Cheraghipour et al., 2012). Hereafter, we call the MNP modified by citric acid as MNP-CA."

      "text" : "Chitosan was conjugated onto MNP-CA through carbodiimide chemistry via developing a chemical link among amine groups of the chitosan molecules and carboxylic groups of the MNP-CA structure based on the procedure described earlier in our study on the preparation of PEG-conjugated magnetite nanoparticles (Cheraghipour and Javadpour, 2013), (Cheraghipour et al., 2013). First, the chitosan mixture was developed by dissolving 2 g of chitosan into 100 mL of acetic acid solvent solution (2%). Afterwards, the reaction solution was sonicated in an ice bath. The carboxylic group of the MNP-CA was activated via EDC. Then, the activate ester made the linkage through the amine group onto chitosan. Sulfo-NHS was utilized to reduce the by-product and to preference the bond formation within the carboxylic and amine group (Cheraghipour et al., 2012, 2013; Hermanson, 2008; Kynclova et al., 1996). Into this solution, EDC (2 mM) was added for a 60 min reaction through vigorous stirring. Then sulfo-NHS (50 mM) was added and reacted for 60 min under agitation. The pH mixture was fixed to 8 by a phosphate buffer. Then, the synthesized MNP-CA (10 mg) was added to the phosphate buffer. Subsequently, it was added into the chitosan solution dropwise. Then, the solutions were mixed via ultra-sonication. Finally, free chitosan molecules were separated with ultra-filtration by a centrifugal device and washed three times. The particles were finally freeze-dried. The asprepared chitosan conjugated MNP-CA nano-biocomposite will be denoted as CH-MNP-CA in the rest of this work."

To reach the optimal condition for the adsorption of Pb(II), a three-level central composite design (CCD) was employed using Design-Expert (version 11.1.2, Stat-Ease, USA): three factors, namely nano-adsorbent concentration (0.2e1.2 g/L), pH (4e7) and contact time (10e80 min), were selected as independent variables, and the uptake percentage was investigated as a response. Based on the CCD approach, twenty experiments were designed. A solution stock of 50 mg/L Pb(II) was added to the nano-adsorbents at concentrations of 0.2, 0.7, and 1.2 g/L. The pHwas set to 4, 5.5, and 7. The specimens were agitated at room temperature in the incubator shaker (150 rpm). In addition, the specimenswere removed at certain periods (10, 45 and 80min). After that, the supernatant was separated using magnetic separation. Moreover, each experiment was replicated thrice for enhanced precision and repeatability, and their mean valuewas considered as the result."

      "text" : "Fig. 1a shows the X-ray powder diffraction diagrams of MNP and CH-MNP-CA. For the MNP, six major characteristic peaks were\nobserved at 2q ¼ {30 , 35.5 , 43 , 53.4 , 57 , 62.6 }, corresponding to the planes’ miller indices of (hkl) ¼ {(220), (311), (400), (422), (440), (511)}, which are comparable with the JCPDS database (PDF No. 85e1436) with no trace of impurity peak, suggesting that the nanoparticles were pure MNP with a structure of spinel cubic (li et al., 2008b), (Nigam et al., 2011; Li et al., 2008c, 2008d; Levy et al., 2002). The Rietveld refinement was employed to measure the grain size via peak broadening (Cheraghipour et al., 2013), (Rietveld, 1969), which were measured to be 12 nm for the crystallite of MNP. Moreover, comparing the XRD pattern of the MNP sample with the CH-MNP-CA one (Fig. 1a), it can be seen that the chemical conjugation of chitosan did not lead to any phase changes of MNP. The observed peak in the XRD pattern of CH-MNP-CA at 2q ¼ 17 is related to the weak crystallinity of chitosan. Fig. 1b shows the TEM of MNP, MNP-CA and CH-MNP-CA, revealing that the nanoparticles were monodisperse. Moreover, it shows different contrasts of MNP and chitosan: a bright shell of amorphous chitosan can be seen over the dark crystalline core of dense MNP. The MNPs were entirely agglomerated, while the MNP-CA with a mean size of about 10 nm showed less agglomeration due to stabilizing with negatively charged citric acid. The average particle size of CHMNP-CAwere slightly larger than the others, which is related to the chemical reaction happened on the particles’ surface. Fig. 1c shows the vibrating scanning magnetometry (VSM) graphs of MNP-CA and CH-MNP-CA, indicating lack of magnetic remanence, coercively force, and hysteresis loop, which are essential criteria for superparamagnetic nanoparticles. The Ms (saturation magnetization) of MNP-CA was 76.01 emu/g; this large value suggests the single-domain magnetic nanoparticles with great crystal structures were fabricated. The Ms value of the CH-MNP-CA was 61.68 emu/g that was slightly less than MNP-CA value as a consequence of the presence of diamagnetic chitosan molecules in the nanocomposites. Nevertheless, the Ms of the resultant nanocomposite is considerably larger than those reported in the literature for other chitosan-coated MNPs (Nasirimoghaddam et al., 2015), (Chen et al., 2011; Sairam et al., 2015).\nFig. 2 shows the FTIR spectrums of MNP, citric acid, MNP-CA, pure chitosan, and CH-MNP-CA. For the MNP (Fig. 2a), three remarkable peaks were involved at 3500, 1630 and 550 cm 1, which referred to non-dissociated OeH groups, OeH stretching mode and FeeOeFe bound in MNP, respectively (Sahoo et al., 2005). For the citric acid, the peak at 1755 cm 1 assigns to the C]O vibration of the COOH groups, which was shifted to 1646 cm 1 for the MNP-CA. This peak shift indicates the linking of the citric acid onto the MNPs through chemical adsorption of carboxylate groups (Chen et al., 2011), (Nigam et al., 2011), (Coates et al., 2000). Considering the spectrum of CH-MNP-CA (Fig. 2b), the absorption peaks at about 3405, 2915, 2860, 1610, 1078 and 590 cm 1 could be assigned to the n(OeH), n(CeH) of the chitosan main chain, the NeH vibrational deformation mode of NH2, the stretch vibration of CeO of amide I (NHCOO ) and the stretching vibration of FeeO, respectively (Liang and Zhang, 2007). Comparing the spectra of the MNP-CA sample and the CH-MNP-CA one, it can be seen that the adsorption peak of the FeeO stretching shifts from 580 to 590 cm 1, and also the adsorption band of NeH bending vibration shifts from 1640 to 1610 cm 1. These imply that the NH2 group of chitosan was covalently attached to the carboxyl group of MNP-CA adequately via a chemical conjugation.\nFig. 2c shows the thermal degradation curves of the MNP-CA, chitosan and CH-MNP-CA, with a maximum weight loss percentage of about 9%, 89% and 75%, respectively. As can be seen, the MNP-CA sample did not experience a remarkable weight loss over the temperature. For the chitosan sample, a two-stage weight loss was recorded: the first transition fell in the range of 25 C to 200 C to be responsible for about 4% weight loss due to dehydration, and\nthe second stage, starting from ~200 C, because of the polysaccharide unit decomposition. The complete weight loss of chitosan at 550 C was around 89%. For the CH-MNP-CA sample, three stages of mass loss were recognized. The initial weight loss at temperatures lower than 250 C was negligible because of using freeze drier for drying. Within the interval of 250 C to 620 C, CHMNP-CA experienced a considerable weight loss (60.1%), which could be a result of the decomposition, degradation and vaporization of various MNP and chitosan functional groups. The last stage, from 620 C to 720 C, was probably because of the continuous decomposition of more stable carbon in the polymer backbone. The zeta potential of MNP, MNP-CA and CH-MNP-CA samples was 4.8, 16.3 and þ 33.6 mV, respectively (supplementary information file, Fig. S2). The difference between the zeta potential of MNP and MNP-CA indicated the adsorption of citric acid on the MNPs surface. After chitosan conjugation, the zeta potential shifts to a high value þ 33.6 mV, which can be explained by the change in the free amine group remaining on the nano-biocomposite surface."

As shows in Fig. 4, the Pb(II) removal increased with increasing pH, especially at pH lower than 5.1, and then it increased smoothly up to pH 6.1. This can be explained as follows: at a small pH, nanoadsorbent functional groups are protonated, resulting in electrostatic repulsion between the protonated nano-adsorbent surface and cationic Pb(II) ions (Zhang et al., 2016). Also, the competition among hydrogen and Pb(II) ion for linking active sites onto the nano-adsorbent becomes intense. This protonated group demonstrated lower ion-exchange and complexation capability with Pb(II) ions, resulting in a decrease in the uptake of Pb(II) ions. Moreover, at a pH range of 5 and 6.1, the deprotonated sites of the nanoadsorbent chelated with the Pb(II) ions, enhancing the removal (Niu et al., 2017). Therefore, pH 6.1 appeared to be the optimal pH. This finding is considerably comparable with the literature (Saleh, 2016; Tu et al., 2017; Vinh et al., 2010; He et al., 2018; Kavosi Rakati et al., 2019).\nAdditionally, the zero-point charge (pHzpc) of the nanoadsorbent was found to be around 5.1 using the solid addition technique; meaning that at the nano-adsorbent surface was positively charged at pH < 5.1, and was unfavorable for the removal through electrostatic interaction. The ion exchange adsorption mechanism was considered to be responsible for the removal of\nlead ions from this range of pH (pH < pHzpc) inwhich the Pb(II) ions bind to available adsorption sites through exchanging two acidic protons. Moreover, at pH > 5.1, the nano-adsorbent surface was negatively charged as the removal increased through electrostatic attraction adsorption mechanism."

      "text" : "Nano-adsorbent is another key parameter that directly affects the removal and should be carefully adjusted. As shown in Fig. 4, the Pb(II) removal initially increased rapidly by increasing the nano-adsorbent dosage, which might be attributed to the more availability of adsorption sites to bind Pb(II) ions and greater nanoadsorbent active sites/Pb(II) ions ratio (Pourmortazavi et al., 2019). However, further increase in the nano-adsorbent concentration (above 1.04 g/L) did not show any progress in the Pb(II) removal, which may be due to the saturation of the surface binding sites (He et al., 2018). These findings are in agreement with the works of Ahmad et al. (Ahmad and Mirza, 2018) and Cao et al. (2014)."

Based on the adsorption kinetics, the agitation time directly reveals\nthe economical adequacy of the adsorption process, which makes it a key effective parameter. Fig. 4 revealed that the removal increased by prolonging the extraction time from 10 to 59.9 min. At the initial stage of the removal, the process was fast, reaching up tomore than 60% only within the first 10 min, which may be due to the availability of more vacant active binding sites on the nano-adsorbent surface. Subsequently, it increased slightly with prolonging the reaction time which may be contributed to the reduced available active sites and slower Pb(II) ions diffusion into the nano-adsorbent surface. After the reaction time of 59.9 min, the Pb(II) removal remained steady, probably because the process reached the equilibrium state. These findings are comparable with the reported results of Dong et al. (2014)."

The experimental data were fitted better with the Langmuir model, compared to the Freundlich and Temkin models, which can be seen by comparing their R2 and RMSE values (Table 3).

      "heading" : "3.4. Adsorption kinetic",
      "text" : "Adsorption kinetic is generally considered as a significant factor to realize the relation between adsorption capacity and contact time (Ma et al., 2019). A number of kinetic models, namely pseudofirst-order (PFO), pseudo-second-order (PSO) and Elovich models, have been developed to analyze the experimental data and consequently determine the adsorption mechanism. The adsorption solution was studied at a pH of 6.1, the nano-adsorbent dosage of 0.5 g/L and the initial Pb(II) ions concentration of 30 mg/L. The kinetics parameters obtained are presented in Table 5. The PFO and the PSO kinetic models suppose that the removal is based on physical adsorption and chemical adsorption, respectively. The adsorption data fit well to the PSO model kinetics (Fig. 5b), with a high R2 value 0.9997, suggesting that chemisorption dominated the sorption rather than mass transport. Moreover, the theoretically calculated qe value is in close agreement with the model predicted qe value from the PSO model (Table 5).\nTo recognize the adsorption mechanism, the data were further investigated by applying the intra-particle diffusion (IPD) model given byWeber andMorris (1963). Fig. 5c shows the multi-step IPD plot for Pb(II) ions adsorption on CH-MNP-CA nano-adsorbents. If the IPD plot represents a straight line passing through the origin, that means the IPD is the only mechanism controlling the adsorption process. However, as shown in Fig. 5c, the adsorption process was affected by three linear sections, which implies that three steps contributed to the adsorption process (Donia et al., 2007), (El-Said, 2010), (Kavosi Rakati et al., 2019). The first step with a sharp slope corresponds to surface diffusion in which high numbers of Pb(II) ions were adsorbed quickly through the surface active sites of CH-MNP-CA nano-adsorbents.\nTable 4 Comparison of Pb (II) ions adsorption capacity of various adsorbents.\nAdsorbent Adsorption capacity (mg/g) Ref.\nMagnetic magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) 53.11 Rajput et al.

In the third step, the equilibrium state reached last. The measured parameters of the IPD model are listed in Table 5. As represented in Table 5, the diffusion rate constants (Kid) in each step follow the order of kid,1 > kid,2 > kid,3, which could be ascribed to restriction of the available vacant diffusion sites of CH-MNP-CA nano-adsorbents (Abdel-Ghani et al., 2016; Yaneva et al., 2013). In conclusion to the kinetic models, it should be noted that both the chemisorption and the IPD among Pb(II) ions and active sites of the nano-adsorbents had impacts on the multi-faceted adsorption process (Abdel-Ghani et al., 2016), (Anisuzzaman et al., 2016)."

      "text" : "Desorption studies were investigated to evaluate the reusability and regeneration of the CH-MNP-CA nano-adsorbents regarding the treatment of Pb(II) ions through conducting five consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles. One of the main steps in the desorption investigation was choosing proper eluent. Hence, the desorption efficiency of different desorption reagents, such as EDTA, H2SO4, HCl, HNO3, and CH3COOHwas studied, and the results are presented in Fig. 6a. Comparing the desorption of the various eluents, it can be seen that EDTA as a strong chelating agent with desorption efficiency of 90% has comparatively better elution power than other desorption solutions. Moreover, acids, such as HCl, can react with MNPs and reduce the magnetic separation of the nano-adsorbent. Thus, EDTA was selected as a desorption solution for Pb(II) ion, because it can form stable complexes with Pb(II) ions. A couple of continuous adsorption/desorption cycles were\nperformed using EDTA solutions (0.1 M) by shaking the nanoadsorbents at 180 rpm for 60 min at room temperature under optimized condition. Then, the nano-adsorbents weremagnetically separated, and supernatant’s Pb(II) ions concentration was examined. Regenerated CH-MNP-CA nano-adsorbent were washed several times with ultrapure water until a neutral pH was obtained and dried for the next adsorption cycle. The adsorption/desorption percentage of five cycles are presented in Fig. 6b, which shows that the efficiency of adsorption and desorption decreased to 80.25 and 73.92%, respectively, in the fifth cycle. The results confirmed that the CH-MNP-CA nano-adsorbents exhibited excellent renewability and reusability up to at least five cycles, and have significant potential in practical application for repeated utilization for Pb(II) ions removal."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "In this study, the novel CH-MNP-CA magnetic nano-adsorbent was effectively synthesized and utilized in the removal process of Pb(II) ion. In summary, MNP was synthesized through the coprecipitation approach and stabilized with citric acid, because MNP has no proper functional groups to bind straight with chitosan. Subsequently, the MNP-CA was covalently bonded to chitosan via carbodiimide chemistry using EDAC/NHS activation. One of the notable advantages of this nano-biocomposite is its chemical conjugation, which does not have the weakness of the ultimate chitosan detachment of physical bonds. Another advantage is the high Ms value before (76.01 emu/g) and after (61.68 emu/g) chitosan conjugation, which makes it more attractive for industrial adsorption process. The performance of the nano-biocomposite as an adsorbent was approved by assessing the Pb(II) ion uptake. The RSM was used for optimizing the adsorption model parameters. The optimal conditions were found to be a pH of 6.1, nanoadsorbent concentration of 1.04 g/L and 59.9 min contact time, resulting in an adsorption percentage of 92.15%. The experimental data were well correlated with the Langmuir isotherm model (R2 ¼ 0.9922). The value of maximum Langmuir sorption capacity (qm) was found to be 192.308 mg/g, which was higher than many other reported nano-adsorbents for the removal of Pb(II) ions. Kinetic studies suggested that the adsorption process follows the PSO (R2 ¼ 0.9997), and the intra-particle diffusion kinetic models suggested the multi-step adsorption mechanism. The nano-adsorbent also exhibited excellent renewability and reusability up to at least five cycles. Based on all these findings, it can be concluded that the CH-MNP-CA nano-biocomposite is an efficient candidate for the adsorption of Pb(II) ion through magnetic separation technology with a high performance in the wastewater treatment.\nCRediT\nElham Cheraghipour; Designed and performed experiments, analyzed data, and wrote the manuscript.
