      "text" : "Gas sensors are devices used for detecting the composition and concentration of gases, which are applied in many fields, including in resident life, industry, military, and medical treatment [1,2]. As a key component, sensing materials play a critical role in the performance of gas sensors. Various materials have been investigated for gas sensing, including semiconducting metal oxides [3–5], conducting polymers [6], carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [7–9], and so on [10]. Among these sensing materials, metal oxides have been extensively investigated in the past few decades, because of their high sensitivity and low cost [11]. However, a high operating temperature (OT) [12] and low selectivity have been their limits. Recently, there have been some attempts looking at the possibility of using metal oxides at room temperature or nearly room temperature, or using light activation instead of heating [13]. But the underlying mechanism is still not clear now. Although conducting polymers can work at room temperature (RT) and can be easily fabricated, the effects of humidity and the performance degradation still limit the ability of the conducting polymer to become incorporated into sensing devices [14]. As for carbon nanotubes, they possess room temperature operability and a superb sensitivity, however, poor reversibility and complex processing still hinders their practical\nNanomaterials 2018, 8, 851; doi:10.3390/nano8100851 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2018, 8, 851 2 of 16\napplication [15]. Thus, it is urgent to explore novel gas-sensing materials with a high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, reversibility, and low operating temperatures. Since the discovery of graphene, a unique two-dimensional layered structure, various 2D nanomaterials have been extensively studied for their use in low temperature gas sensors, both in traditional experiments and in theoretical calculations [16,17]. 2D nanomaterials generally possess a large surface-to-volume ratio, which is advantageous for gas sensing applications as it facilitates surface reactions. In particular, 2D layered nanomaterials have aroused a large amount of interest because of their excellent semiconducting performances, and because they can be easily configured into chemiresistive field effect transistors (FETs). Other attractive features are the unique thickness dependent physical and chemical properties, particularly in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Compared to the traditional experimental methods, theoretical calculations have the obvious advantage of saving costs both in terms of time and effort. Furthermore, the calculation approach allows for identifying the atomistic processes of gas sensing, and for exploring the intrinsic changes inside the sensing materials. Along with the development of computational materials science, the theoretical calculation methods can not only be used to provide the reasonable and profound explanations for the experimental results, but they are helpful for the design of new materials structures and thus new functionalities. In this review, we mainly focus on the contribution of the theoretical calculations in order to the study of gas-sensing properties of 2D nanomaterials, such as graphene and its derivatives (reduced graphene oxide and graphene oxide), and TMDs. Theoretical studies of the interactions between gas molecules and 2D sensing materials provided both a theoretical basis, as well as design ideas for developing novel gas-sensing materials with an enhanced gas-sensing performance."

      "text" : "Various explanations for their gas sensing behavior have been proposed in the literature. On the basis of theoretical calculations, it is believed that the gas species are physically adsorbed on the surface of 2D layered nanomaterials [18], because of the long distance of adsorption, weak adsorption energy, small amount of charge transfer, and almost constant electronic structure. However, those results were obtained with perfect monolayer materials as a model, and thus the inert surface shows a low sensitivity. As a matter of fact, defects are unavoidably introduced during the material synthesis processes, which are usually more reactive than the perfect lattice sites. Therefore, chemical adsorption between the gas molecules and the defective or functionalized sites can occur on the surface of the 2D nanosheets. Through the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, one can find adsorption distances of gas molecules closer than the sum of two atomic radii. Therefore, the adsorption energy and the amount of charge transfer are much larger compared to the physical adsorption. As a consequence, much larger changes in the electronic properties are induced, caused by the strong hybridization between the gas molecular orbitals and the 2D materials’ orbitals. Fundamentally, a charge transfer occurs between the gas and the 2D layered nanomaterials, which results in changes in the conductivity or resistivity of the sensing materials [16,19,20]. Two kinds of charge transfer mechanisms are widely proposed [21], namely: (i) A charge transfer that can occur depending on the relative positions of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest un-occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the gas molecules. If the HOMO is above the Fermi level of the pure material (the Dirac point), there is a charge transfer to the 2D nanomaterial. If the LUMO is below the Dirac point, the charge will be extracted from the nanosheet towards the gas molecule. (ii) The charge transfer between the gas molecules and 2D nanomaterials is also partially determined by the mixing of the HOMO and LUMO with the 2D nanomaterial orbitals through hybridization. The mixing degree scales with the overlap of the interacting orbitals and the inverse of their energy difference. When the sensors are exposed to the targeted gas molecules, the gas species are adsorbed on the surface of the 2D sensing materials that are acting as electronic donors or acceptors. Consequently,\nNanomaterials 2018, 8, 851 3 of 16\nif the charge affinity of the sensing materials is increased intentionally, a possible improvement of the sensitivity and selectivity of the gas sensors can be expected. Upon exposure to air or nitrogen, the gas molecules are expected to desorb from the surface of the sensing materials. Therefore, hindering the charge transfer is beneficial for the desorption process, leading to an improvement in the reversibility of the gas sensors. The properties of the gas-sensing materials can thus be controlled with respect to the charge affinity of the gas species."

      "text" : "The gas-sensing performance of novel materials can be theoretically predicted with the help of DFT calculations. Stable monolayers or several layers of 2D nanosheets are used as a base material for the adsorption of gas molecules. The most stable form of an adsorption model can be determined by means of energy relaxation. Therefore, the positions and orientations of the gas molecules on the surface of the sensing material as well as the distances between them can be easily determined. Furthermore, the interaction of gas molecules on the surface of the sensing materials is explored through the analysis of adsorption energies, energy gap variation, density of states (DOS), electron density, and Bader charges. The adsorption energy confirms the adsorption ability of the gas species. The adsorption energy of the gas molecules on the surface of the sensing materials is defined as follows:\nEad = Egas+material − Ematrerial − Egas (1)\nwhere Egas+material is the energy of the optimized structure of the gas molecule adsorbed on the sensing material, and Ematerial and Egas , in turn, are the energies of the pristine sensing material layer and of the isolated gas molecule, respectively [22]. Therefore, when Ead attains a negative value, it means that the gas adsorption is a spontaneous and favorable process. The band structure and the DOS give clear insights on the electronic properties of the sensing materials’ nanosheets after gas adsorptions. The Bader charge analysis confirms the charge transfer between the gas molecules and the sensing material.

Table 1 shows some typical\nexamples. Although the calculation methods are different, the relative results all exhibit a similar\ntrend. For instance, the adsorption energies of NO2 on the WSe2, resulting from two different kinds\nof calculations, both yield the maximal value, which indicates that WSe2 possesses the highest\nsensitivity to NO2. However, different algorithms for evaluating the affinity of different target\nmolecules and sensing layers limit the comparison between different gas sensing materials.\nTherefore, the sensing properties’ comparison of different materials, such as the comparison of WS2\nand WSe2 [23], should be made in a certain gas atmosphere with the same calculation method. From\nthese calculation results, one can judge whether the sensing material is a promising candidate for the\nchosen gas species or not. For instance, Bui et al. [24] investigated the interaction between a WS2\nmonolayer and several kinds of gas molecules (CO, H2O, NO, and O2) using first‐principle\ncalculations. The reported adsorption energies clearly indicate a physical adsorption between the\ngas molecules and WS2 monolayers. Furthermore, the calculation results show that the NO and O2\nadsorption narrows the band gap of the material, adding new electronic states in the band gap.\nFurthermore, according to the Bader charge analysis for all of the structures, NO and O2 can\nwithdraw more electronic charge than H2O and CO. These observations indicate a promising\napplication of WS2 for NO‐ and O2‐sensing. In addition, Zhou et al. [25] calculated more gas species\n(H2, NH3, and NO2) adsorbed on the surface of WS2 than mentioned before. According to their\npaper, monolayer WS2 exhibited a better sensitivity with respect to NO2 than NO and O2, because of\nthe higher adsorption energy and the larger charge transfer. Their theoretical results for the\nadsorption of NH3 and NO2 on the WS2 monolayers are also consistent with the most recent\nexperimental data [26–28]. Li et al. [28] successfully made a room temperature ammonia sensor\nusing WS2 nanoflakes as the sensing materials. The sensor showed a p‐type response to ammonia. It\nindicated a good sensitivity and good response/recovery speeds at various concentrations of\nammonia from 1 to 10 ppm, as applied at room temperature. The response and recovery times of the\nsensor to 5 ppm ammonia are ~120 and ~150 s, respectively. Obviously, through the above analysis,\nthe excellent gas sensing materials must possess the following properties: appropriate adsorption\nenergy, a high level of charge transfer, a reduced band gap after the gas molecular adsorption onto\nthe semiconductors.\nThe oxygen and humidity in the air always have a significant impact on the gas detection\nprocess. Theoretical calculations can help to understand the influence of oxygen and humidity in the\nbackground in gas detection. Xiong et al. [29] calculated the adsorption energy of NH3 on the surface\nof monolayer SnS2 with different oxygen concentrations using DFT, as shown in Figure 3. The results\nshowed that the adsorption energies increase with the increase of the oxygen content in the\nbackground, indicating that the presence of O2 gas promoted the adsorption of NH3. According to a\nprevious report, O2 usually acts as an electron acceptor, while NH3 acts as an electron donor [30].\nFigure Spin-polarized density of states (DOS) of (a) NO nd (b) NO2 adsorbed on MoS2 (reproduced from [22], with permission from ELSEVIER, 2018).\nGas adsorption on most of the 2D layered nano aterials, such as graphene, oS2, S2, SnS2, MoSe2, and WSe2, has b en studied from first-principles calculations.

[29] calculated the adsorption energy of NH3 on the surface of monolay r SnS2 w th different oxygen concentrati ns using DFT, as show in Figure 3.

According to\nNanomaterials 2018, 8, 851 5 of 16\na previous report, O2 usually acts as an electron acceptor, while NH3 acts as an electron donor [30]. When the O2 molecules adsorb on the surface of SnS2 (an n-type semiconductor), there will be a charge transfer from the SnS2 to O2 molecules, leading to an increase in the resistance of SnS2. As a certain concentration of NH3 gas is introduced, the adsorbed NH3 molecules are expected to donate electrons to SnS2, which confirms the decrease in resistance of SnS2. In this way, the presence of oxygen enhances the sensor response to ammonia.\nNanomaterials 2018, 8, 851 6 of 16\nNanomaterials 2018, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 16"

Further\nNanomaterials 2018, 8, 851 7 of 16\nexplorations into the growth mechanisms and defect formation energies calculations confirmed these experimental observations. Recently, Komsa et al. [39] suggested a new way of engineering the electronic structure of TMDs. Firstly, the corresponding electron energies required to produce the defects can be estimated on the basis of the displacement threshold energies (Td), which can be calculated by means of the DFT method. The required vacancies can then be created under exposure to corresponding electron beams. Finally, the vacancies created by the electron beam can be filled with impurity atoms to achieve doping in TMDs. In addition, the method of low-energy argon ion beam sputtering can also selectively desulfurize the monolayer MoS2 without significantly depleting the molybdenum [40]. Doping is one of the most frequently used methods to modify the performance of materials. It has been reported that the doping of both nonmetal [41,42] (B, N, P, Cl, etc.) and transition-metal [43–47] (Cu, Ag, Au, Pd, Pt, Ni, Nb, etc.) elements can change their electronic and magnetic properties, as well as the chemical activity of 2D nanomaterials, as shown in Table 2. According to theoretical calculations, dopants can always occupy the vacancies because of their large binding energies with surrounding atoms [48]. Additionally, the electronic properties of substrates could be modulated, even undergoing transitions from semiconductor to half-metal behavior [34], due to the presence of the dopants. Furthermore, the strong orbital hybridization between dopants and gas molecules can significantly improve the gas sensitivity and can promote the transfer of electrons [49]. In particular, the partially occupied orbitals of the dopant atoms near the Fermi level play a crucial role [47,50]. Calculations of the optimized geometry structure, adsorption energy, density of states, and charge transfer analysis indicate that most of the gas molecules settle down on the doped substrates by chemisorption rather than by weak physisorption, which dominates on the pristine surface. For instance, Xin et al. [51] found that the adsorption energies of H2CO molecules on the surface of Ti-doped and V-doped graphene were about one order of magnitude higher than those on the pristine graphene. The charge transfer between the H2CO and Ti-doped graphene also showed a 38-times improvement compared with pristine graphene. When NO was adsorbed on B- and P- doped monolayer MoS2, the band gap demonstrated a decrease of 0.52 eV and 0.69 eV, respectively. leading to an improvement of the electrical conductivity [41]. Zhang et al. [52] systematically investigated Ni-, Fe-, and Co-doped MoS2 film sensors at room-temperature through experiments and by means of DFT calculations. The results showed that the Ni-doped MoS2 film sensors exhibited a relatively short response and recovery time, and an excellent stability towards SO2 gas.\nNanomaterials 2018, 8, 851 8 of 16\nGrain boundaries are important defects in materials. The disordered atomic arrangement at the grain boundaries makes their properties different from those of the grain interior. Previous experiments have revealed the influence of grain boundaries on the properties of sensing materials [56,57]. Choi et al. [46] doped Nb into two-dimensional MoS2 layered nanomaterials in order to improve their gas sensing properties. The ADF-STEM images clearly show that a decrease in the grain size correlates with an increased concentration of Nb doping. Thus, a large number of grain boundaries and stable dopant Nb dopants were responsible for the improvement of the sensitivity and stability of the gas sensor. Furthermore, the Nb atoms can directly form chemical bonds with some gas molecules, in addition to indirectly enhancing the sensitivity of MoS2 through modulating their electronic properties by donating electrons or holes to the conduction or valence bands, respectively. The other calculation of gas adsorption on the Nb doped graphene sheets (Nb/G) was reported by Kumar et al. [54]. In their study, CO and SO2 molecules were demonstrated to be chemisorbed on the surface of Nb/G. Edge sites always possess a high surface energy and thus are hard to form on the outside surfaces [58]. Edges, nevertheless, have more active sites than basal planes, because of their increased number of dangling bonds, maximal roughness, and different local stoichiometry [59]. Thus, it has been found that edge sites show much better surface properties for catalysis and gas-sensing performance. Cho et al. [60] verified through DFT calculations that the NO2 adsorption energies were higher on the edge sites than on the basal plane of MoS2. In particular, it was found that, because of the higher adsorption energy on the edge sites, the NO2 adsorption directly correlates with the density of the exposed edge sites on the MoS2 (see Figure 4). In this work, two different types of edge configurations with different coverages of S (50% and 100%) on the Mo edge were considered. Similarly, the ratio of the edge–surface sites has influence in the gas response and recovery of MoSe2 nanosheets [61]. Maximally exposing the edges on the film surfaces is a favorable way to enhance the sensitivity of the 2D layered nanomaterials. Forming active edge sites, which are thermodynamically unfavorable compared to the inert basal plane sites, presents a particular challenge. A method for the rapid sulfurization/selenization of MoS2 and MoSe2 thin films with vertically aligned layers was presented by Kong et al. [62]. With elemental sulfur/selenium powders as the precursors, e-beam evaporated ultrathin Mo films were converted into MoS2/MoSe2 films by a rapid sulfurization/selenization process in a horizontal tube furnace. Cho et al. [60] successfully synthesized horizontally aligned (basal-plane exposed) and vertically aligned (edge-exposed) MoS2 films using a rapid CVD sulfurization process. Under identical concentrations of the gas molecules, it was verified that gas sensors based on vertically aligned MoS2 films showed about a five-fold enhanced sensitivity to NO2 gas molecules compared to the horizontally aligned ones. Kibsgaard et al. [58] synthesized the\nNanomaterials 2018, 8, 851 9 of 16\ncontinuous large-area thin films of a highly ordered double-gyroid MoS2 bicontinuous network with nanoscale pores so as to engender more exposed edge sites. Where strong binding to dopants and defect sites is advantageous for adsorption, it is disadvantageous for desorption, as it results in long recovery times in gas sensors. Additionally, vacancies and edges often become unstable upon the adsorption of O2 and H2O in air. Therefore, it is necessary to take these impurities into consideration during the simulation of the adsorption process.

[73]. The results show that NO2 possesses the largest adsorption energy among all of the gas molecules considered, which was attributed to the changes in the heterojunction electronic structure that occurred upon charge transfer during adsorption. Furthermore, previous reports of first-principle calculations showed that the narrow band gaps of heterojunctions can induce a high density of charge and chemisorbed oxygen, so that the response of the SnO2/SnS2 hybrids becomes dramatically increased [82]. However, there are almost no theoretical calculation studies that compare the electronic structures, the binding energies, levels of charge transfer, adsorption behaviors, and geometrical structure of heterojunctions with their component materials. This may be due to the complexity of the respective model constructions."

The DFT calculations show that a negative electric field, F, can increase the adsorption energy of CO on Al-doped graphene, while a positive F can weaken the adsorption.

The electron transfer mechanism between NO2 and the Ga-doped graphene monolayer under different electric fields is shown in Figures 5 and 6.

As an important research method, theoretical calculations have been massively applied in predicting the potentially excellent gas sensing properties of these 2D nanomaterials. In this review, we discuss the contributions of theoretical calculations in the study of the gas sensing properties of 2D nanomaterials. Firstly, we elaborate on the gas sensing mechanisms of 2D layered nanomaterials, such as the traditional charge transfer mechanism, and a standard for distinguishing between physical and chemical adsorption, from the perspective of theoretical calculations. Then, we describe how to conduct a theoretical analysis to explain or predict the gas sensing properties of 2D nanomaterials. Thirdly, we discuss three important methods that have been applied in order to improve the gas sensing properties, that is, defect functionalization (vacancy, edge, grain boundary, and doping), heterojunctions, and electric fields. Among these strategies, theoretical calculations play a very important role in explaining the mechanisms underlying the enhanced gas sensing properties. Finally, we summarize both the advantages and limitations of the theoretical calculations, and present perspectives for further research on the 2D nanomaterials-based gas sensors.",
