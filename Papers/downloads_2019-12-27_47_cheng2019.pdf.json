In this work, nano/ultrafine-grained FeCoCrNiMnAlx HEAs were produced by powder metallurgy, and the effects of Al addition and temperature on the friction and wear properties of the alloys were studied. The addition of Al led to grain refinement, body-centered cubic (BCC) phase precipitation and an increased hardness, which significantly improved the wear resistance of the alloys at various temperatures. At elevated temperatures, such as 800 C, the alloys (especially the Alcontaining alloys) exhibited outstanding wear resistance, which was mainly attributed to the formation of the continuous and dense oxide film on the worn surface due to the nano-/ultrafine-grained structure.

      "text" : "High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new type of metal material developed in recent years that are composed of multiple principal elements in equimolar or near-equimolar ratios that have unique atomic structure characteristics [1]. Through reasonable composition and process design, HEAs can show superior properties to those of traditional alloys, such as high strength, high hardness, good wear resistance and elevated temperature oxidation resistance, which can be expected to be applied moulds and aerospace and energy engineering fields [1e4].\nHEAs used in moving structural parts should have not only good mechanical properties but also good wear resistance. At present, the study of HEAs mainly focuses on the microstructure and mechanical properties. However, there is limited understanding of the wear behaviour of HEAs, especially at elevated temperatures. Previous works have shown that the room temperature wear\nl and Materials Engineering,\nnce and Engineering, Fujian\n, pqdai@126.com (P. Dai).\nresistance of HEAs increases with increasing hardness [5,6]. Moreover, the wear resistance can be further improved by surface treatments such as nitriding [7] and boriding [8]. Additionally, the addition of alloying elements, such as Al [5,9], Ti [6] and Cu [10], can significantly improve the wear resistance of HEAs, especially the elevated temperature wear resistance. The main wear mechanisms transformed from abrasive wear at room temperature to mild oxidative wear as well as delamination wear at elevated temperatures [9], which was attributed to the good resistance to softening and the presence of compact metal oxide surface films formed at elevated temperature [6,9].\nHowever, previous studies on the friction andwear properties of HEAs have mainly focused on coarse-grained alloys prepared by melting [5e7,9e13]. For ultrafine-grained and even nanocrystalline HEAs, the wear resistance is mainly studied for nitrides of HEAs [14], while there is a lack of understanding of the friction and wear properties for the nano-/ultrafine-grained bulk HEAs. It is well known that for traditional alloys, nano/ultrafine-grained structure can increase the hardness; thus, the alloys usually present excellent wear resistance, and some even show decreased friction coefficients [15e18]. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the friction and wear properties of nano/ultrafine-grained HEAs.\nEquiatomic FeCoCrNiMn alloy is the most widely studied HEA,\nwhich has excellent ductility and toughness, especially the toughness value exceeds that of most other materials. However, its strength and hardness are low [19]. Therefore, many researchers have carried out studies on the strengthening of this alloy [20e30]. This alloy can be strengthened mainly by doping with alloying elements (such as Al [20] and C [21,22]) and refining the grains (such as with rolling [23e25], high-pressure torsion [26], swaging [27] and powder metallurgy [28e30]). It is noteworthy that powder metallurgy is a Green Manufacturing technology with a low cost. Moreover, by powder metallurgy, nano/ultrafine-grained FeCoCrNiMn HEAs have been easily prepared and showed increased compressive strength and hardness [28e30], which were beneficial for improving the wear resistance of this alloy.\nOur preliminary study showed that the addition of Al further refined the grains of the nano/ultrafine-grained FeCoCrNiMn HEA, and a high Al concentration induced the precipitation of BCC phase, which further improved the strength and hardness of the alloy [31]. However, the effect of Al addition on the friction and wear properties and wear mechanisms of FeCoCrNiMn HEA have yet to be determined. In addition, it was also found that the addition of Al significantly increased the oxidation resistance of HEAs, and thus improved the elevated temperature wear resistance [6,9]. Therefore, in this work, the effects of Al content and temperature (from room temperature to 800 C) on the friction andwear properties of the nano/ultrafine-grained FeCoCrNiMnAlx HEAs fabricated by powder metallurgy were explored and are discussed in detail."

      "text" : "The FeCoCrNiMnAlx HEAs with different aluminium contents (x ¼ 0, 0.5 and 1 in molar ratio) were prepared by powder metallurgy (mechanical alloying and hot-pressed sintering). Firstly, metal powders with high purity ( 99.9%), such as Fe, Co Cr, Ni, Mn and Al, were mixed in proportion, and then the FeCoCrNiMnAlx alloy powders (that is, FeCoCrNiMn, FeCoCrNiMnAl0.5 and FeCoCrNiMnAl alloys, which are abbreviated as Al0, Al0.5 and Al1 alloys, respectively) were synthesized in a planetary ball mill (QM-QX4L, ChangshaMiqi Instrument Equipment Co., Ltd., China). After 45 h of ball milling, the alloy powders were sintered in a vacuum hotpressing furnace (ZT-40-20Y, Shanghai Chenhua Electric Furnace Co., Ltd., China) to form alloy blocks. The sintering temperature, holding time and pressure were 900 C, 1 h and 50 MPa, respectively. After the heat preservation was finished, the alloy blocks were cooled to room temperature along with the furnace. The specific preparation processes of the alloy specimens were detailed in our previous work [31].\nThe microstructure and phase composition of the alloys were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD analysis was performed using a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation. SEM investigations were performed using a Hitachi S4800 electron microscope equipped with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). TEM investigations were performed using a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.\nHardness measurements at room temperature were performed using an HXD-1000T hardness testing machine with a load of 10 N for 15 s. Hardness measurements at elevated temperatures were performed using an HVT-1000 high-temperature hardness tester equipped with a heating and vacuum part. During the hot hardness test, the vacuum in the sample bin was approximately 5 Pa with a load of 200 N for 15 s. The hardness of each specimen was measured at least 10 times and then the average value was calculated. The compressive properties at room temperature were measured by using an MTS 10 test machine with a strain rate of\n1 10 3 s 1. Cylindrical specimens with a diameter of 3 mm and height of 4.5 mm were used. The compression tests for each alloy were carried out for 3 times to obtain the average value.\nDry sliding wear tests were carried out using a ball-on-disc apparatus (GHT-1000E, Lanzhou Zhongke Kaihua Technology Co., Ltd., China) at various temperatures (room temperature, 200 C, 500 C and 800 C) using a Si3N4 ball (5 mm in diameter) against the flat alloy specimens. Three tests were performed for all alloys at each temperature, and the applied normal load, friction radius, sliding velocity and friction time were 10 N, 5 mm, 450 rpm and 15 min, respectively. During the wear tests, the vacuum in the sample bin was approximately 5 Pa. The friction coefficient was recorded at a sampling rate of 2 Hz throughout the duration of the test. The three-dimensional morphologies of the wear scars and wear rates of the alloys were measured by a MicroXAM 3D surface profilometer."

      "text" : "Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Al0, Al0.5 and Al1 bulk alloys. The Al0 alloy consisted of the FCC phase and a small quantity of M23C6 and M7C3 carbides. For the Al0.5 alloy, the addition of Al induced BCC precipitates, but the matrix phase of the alloy was still FCC phase. With an increase in the Al content, the primary phase of the Al-containing alloy (such as the Al1 alloy) transformed from the FCC to BCC phase. In addition, the addition of Al also led to the formation of a small amount of Al2O3 phase in the alloy.\nFig. 2 shows micrographs of the alloys. The SEM micrographs of the alloys present multiphase microstructure consisting of two regions: coarse grains and fine grains (Fig. 2a and 2f). For the Al0 alloy, the coarse grains (>1 mm [31]) comprised the FCC solid solution phase, and the fine grains included the FCCmatrix phase and traces of carbides. The addition of Al led to the transformation of the fine-grained region into island-style grains (i.e., the Al1 alloy in Fig. 2c). Additionally, the addition of Al also induced BCC precipitates enriched with Ni and Al. Therefore, for the Al0.5 and Al1 alloys, the coarse-grained region comprised FCC and BCC phases, while the fine-grained regions contained FCC þ BCC matrix phases and a small amount of carbides and Al2O3 phases [31]. Fig. 2g, 2h and 2i show TEM micrographs of the fine-grained regions of the alloys. By the statistical analysis from the microstructure, the\naverage grain sizes of the constituent phases in the fine-grained regions were shown in Table 1. It can be seen that the average grain sizes of FCC phase and carbides of Al0 as-sintered alloy are 220 nm and 193 nm, respectively, while the addition of Al led to further refinement (about 150 nm in size) of the constituent phases of the alloys. However, with a further increase in the Al content, the grain size change was not obvious. The phase formation and transformation mechanisms of the alloys were discussed in detail in our previous work [31]. It is noteworthy that such fine grains can improve the wear resistance of the alloys [15,18].\nTable 2 shows the compressive strength, yield strength, plastic strain and hardness of the alloys at room temperature. The strength and hardness of the alloys increasedwith increasing Al content, and the plastic strain decreased at the same time. The Al0.5 alloy exhibited relatively good compressive mechanical properties. Its yield strength, compressive strength, plastic strain and hardness were 1932 MPa, 2376 MPa, 3.8% and 553 HV, respectively. The Al1 alloy did not show plasticity during compression due to the brittle BCC phase as the matrix phase. However, the compressive strength and hardness were relatively high, reaching 2406 MPa and 684 HV, respectively.\nThe hot harness trends of the alloys with temperature are shown in Fig. 3. The hot hardness of Al0, Al0.5 and Al1 alloys did not decrease obviously from room temperature to 500 C, where they decreased by only 13.3%, 24.9% and 19.7%, respectively. In particular,\nthe Al1 alloy maintained a high hardness of 549 HVat 500 C. The hot hardness of the alloys began to decrease significantly until the temperature increased to 800 C. These alloys had good hightemperature softening resistance."

      "text" : "Fig. 4 shows the change curves of the wear rates of the alloys with the test temperature. From room temperature to 200 C, the wear rates were increased as the test temperature increased. The increased wear rate indicates a decreased wear resistance. And then, the wear rates were decreased with increasing temperature up to 500 C, but they were still of the same order of magnitude, that is, 10 4 mm3/(N$m). However, when the test temperature reaches 800 C, the wear rates of the alloys are decreased significantly and are one order of magnitude less than that before, reaching 10 5 mm3/(N$m). These indicate that the alloys have better wear resistance at elevated temperatures, such as 800 C. In addition, Fig. 4 also shows that increasing the Al content improved the wear resistance of the alloys at various test temperatures. For example, the wear rate of the Al1 alloy was 61.5% lower than that of the Al0 alloy at 800 C. The Si3N4 ceramic for the grinding ball had good high-temperature capability [32], allowing wear rates of the tested alloys to be directly compared. Therefore, in this work, it can be inferred that the FeCoCrNiMnAlx HEAs have excellent wear resistance at elevated temperatures, which should be determined by the properties of the alloys themselves."

      "heading" : "3.3. Morphology and phase composition of the worn surfaces",
      "text" : "Fig. 5 shows SEM images of the worn surfaces of the Al0, Al0.5 and Al1 alloys at different test temperatures. Thewornmorphology of the alloys varied greatly with Al content at room temperature. For the Al0 alloy, many wear particles, grooves parallel to the sliding direction and plastic deformation were observed on the worn surface (Fig. 5a). With an increase in the Al content in the alloy, the worn surfaces gradually become smooth, with only small debris and shallow grooves, which indicate that the addition of Al significantly improved the wear resistance of the alloys.\nWhen the test temperature increased to 200 C, theworn surfaces of the Al0 and Al0.5 alloys revealed numerous deeper grooved scratches parallel to the sliding direction and more plastic deformation than that at roomtemperature. For theAl1 alloy, thewornsurface was smoother than that of the Al0 and Al0.5 alloys, but there were larger adhesive blocks compared to that at room temperature. These results are consistent with the wear rate results. The alloys experiencedmore substantialwearat200 C thanthatat roomtemperature. This is because the three alloys softened to a certain extent at 200 C, resulting in a weak ability to resist adhesion, ploughing and plastic deformation during the friction with the Si3N4 ball.\nAlthough the alloys softened further at 500 C, the worn surfaces of the alloys were smoother than those at 200 C, which presented relatively mild adhesive wear, ploughing and plastic deformation characteristics. This indicates that the wear resistance of the alloys was improved with further increases in the temperature. As the experimental temperature increased to 800 C, the worn surface of the alloys became smoother than those at other temperatures, and only small grooves and scratches were observed, especially for the Al0.5 and Al1 alloys. The results show that the alloys had improved wear resistance at 800 C.\nFig. 6 shows the three-dimensional morphologies of the worn surfaces of the three alloys at room temperature and 800 C. The worn surfaces of the Al0 and Al0.5 alloys at room temperaturewere rough, containing deep tear pits and obvious material accumulation. At 800 C, the wear marks were obviously shallower than those at room temperature, and no obvious tear pits were found, but the worn surfaces were also relatively rough, especially for the Al0 alloy. For the Al1 alloy, the worn surfaces at room temperature and 800 C were smoother than those of Al0 and Al0.5 alloys; only shallow furrows and small plastic deformation were observed at\nroom temperature. At 800 C, the plough grooves and the plastic deformation decreased, indicating improved wear resistance.\nTo better understand the influence of the test temperature on the friction and wear properties, the component and phase composition of the worn surfaces of the alloys were analysed. Table 3 gives the SEM/EDS analysis results of the worn surfaces of the alloys at various test temperatures. As the test temperature increased, the oxygen content on the worn surface increased gradually, which indicates that the oxidation degree of the worn surface was aggravated by increasing test temperature. It is noteworthy that, at elevated temperatures, such as 800 C, the content of Mn on the worn surfaces of the Al0 and Al0.5 alloys was obviously higher than that of the other elements, except oxygen, while for the Al1 alloy, the content of Al on the worn surface was high. Fig. 7 shows the XRD patterns of the worn surfaces of the alloys at the test temperature of 800 C. For the Al0 alloy, the oxides on the worn surface were mainly manganese oxides (such as MnO and Mn2O3). For the Al-containing alloys, alumina was also formed on the worn surfaces. With an increase in the Al content, the main oxidation on the worn surface transformed frommanganese oxides to alumina.\nThe cross-section SEM-EDSmaps of the worn tracks of the three alloys at the test temperature of 800 C are shown in Fig. 8 and indicate that the oxide layers were formed on the worn surfaces of the alloys during the dry sliding wear testing. The cross-section SEM-EDS maps also confirmed that the main oxides on the worn surface transformed from manganese oxides to alumina with increasing Al content. In addition, it is noteworthy that the addition of Al reduced the thickness of oxide layers from approximately 2 mm to less than 1 mm, indicating that the oxidation resistance of the alloys was significantly improved due to the addition of Al. In the FeCoCrNiMnAlx HEA system, the elements may combine with oxygen to form oxides, and the order of the free energy of oxide formation is as follows: DGAl2O3< DGMnO < DGCr2O3 < DGFe3O4 < DGCoO < DGNiO [33]. For the Al-containing alloys, the Al element first binds to the oxygen element, followed by Mn, Cr and other elements. During the sliding friction and wear, when the dense oxide film, which was mainly composed of Al2O3, was formed first, it prevented the oxygen from diffusing into the alloy and the alloy elements from diffusing to the outside, which made it difficult for other oxides to form [33]. Therefore, with increasing Al content, the total oxide content on the worn surface of the alloy decreased, and its oxidation resistance was improved.\n3.3. Friction coefficient\nFig. 9 shows the friction coefficient curves with time at different temperatures and the variations of the average friction coefficient with the temperatures. It can be seen from Fig. 9a, 9b and 9c that when testing begins there is a gradual increase in the friction coefficient value until it reaches a steady state, due to the breaking-in of theworn surface and the settling down of the indenter [9,13]. For Al0 alloy, there is a slight fluctuation in the steady state friction coefficient at room temperature and 200 C (Fig. 9a), and then, the friction coefficient exhibits pronounced fluctuations with increase in temperature. Fig. 9b and 9c show the friction coefficient curves of Al0.5 and Al1 alloys at different temperatures, respectively, and the effect trends of test temperature on the dry sliding frictional behaviour are similar with Al0 alloy. It is noteworthy that the friction coefficient of Al1 alloy exhibits more pronounced fluctuations than that of other alloys at elevated temperature such as 500 C and 800 C. This phenomenon of the fluctuations of the curves may be led by two reasons as follows. Firstly, the periodic accumulation and elimination of the debris on the worn surface may contribute to this phenomenon [9,13]. When the debris accumulates on the worn surface, the friction coefficient increases, while it decreases as the debris is separated from the worn surface or filled in the grinding crack [13]. In addition, the periodic localised fracture of the worn surface may also result in the fluctuation of the curve [9,13]. For the Al-containing alloys, especially Al1 alloy, the periodic localised fracture dominates for the contribution of the fluctuations of the curves, due to the harder matrix [5,7].\nFig. 9d shows the correlation between the average friction coefficients of the alloys and their test temperatures. It can be seen that the test temperature has little influence on the average friction coefficient to the Al0 alloy, the average friction coefficient is about 0.25. For the Al0.5 alloy, the average friction coefficient at room temperature and 200 C was 0.32; then, as the temperature increased, the average friction coefficient decreased gradually and was only 0.19 at 800 C. For the Al1 alloy, the average friction coefficient at room temperature was 0.31; as the temperature increased, the average friction coefficient first increased to the peak value (0.4) at 200 C and then decreased rapidly to 0.19 at 800 C. It is worth noting that the average friction coefficients of Al0.5 and Al1 alloys at 800 C were the lowest among the samples studied herein, indicating that the two alloys had good anti-friction properties at this temperature. This is because the continuous and dense aluminium oxide films were formed on the worn surfaces of the Alcontaining alloys at 800 C, which is beneficial to decrease the friction coefficient [34,35]. In addition, the decrease of adhesive force also contributes to the decline of the friction coefficient. When the temperature of the contact interface is higher than a critical value, the adhesive force is decreased with the increase of temperature [12,13]. This can be verified by the smooth worn surfaces of the Al-containing alloys at 800 C (Fig. 5k and l). At other temperatures, the average friction coefficients of the Al-containing alloys are higher than that of Al0 alloy. As previously mentioned, the addition of Al led to BCC phase precipitation and an increased hardness, which increased the friction on the worn surface, and thus led to the high average friction coefficient [9]."

      "heading" : "4. Discussion",
      "text" : "As the matrix phase of the Al0 alloy was a soft FCC solid solution and the hardness was low (only 415 HV), it experienced substantial wear during frictionwith the Si3N4 ball at room temperature. Under the repeated friction of the Si3N4 ball, the adhesive parts of the alloy surface were dragged out to form adhesive layers, which showed typical adhesive wear characteristics [6]. The micro-convex bodies on the surface of the Si3N4 ball and many debris scattered on the alloy surface had a ploughing effect on the soft alloy surface during friction, thus showing the characteristics of abrasive wear [9]. In addition, because the Al0 alloy had good plasticity, when the stress of the grinding ball exceeded the yield strength of the alloy, some plastic deformation were produced on the surface of the alloy, so the alloy also showed plastic extrusion wear characteristics [13].\nThe worn surface morphology of Al0.5 alloy was similar to that\nof Al0 alloy, and it also showed the characteristics of adhesive wear and abrasive wear, but the grooves became shallower and the adhesion phenomenon was reduced. This is attributed to the grain refinement and the BCC precipitates due to the addition of Al, which improved the hardness of the alloy and thus improved the wear resistance.With increasing Al content, thematrix phase of the alloy (Al1 alloy) was transformed into a hard BCC phase, resulting in a significant improvement in the wear resistance. The wear surface was smooth and had no obvious plastic deformation characteristics. Compared to those of the Al0 and Al0.5 alloys, the grooves were\nshallower, and the adhesive blocks were obviously reduced, with only small debris distributed on the worn surface. Therefore, the Al1 alloy showed mild adhesive wear and abrasive wear characteristics.\nWhen the experimental temperature increased to 200 C, the\nFig. 8. SEM/EDS maps of the cross-sections at the worn tracks of (a) Al0,\nthree alloys softened to a certain extent and experienced more substantial wear than that at room temperature. The main wear mechanisms were relatively substantial adhesive wear, abrasive wear and plastic extrusion wear. For the Al1 alloy, a large adhesive block can be observed on the worn surface, which indicates that\n(b) Al0.5 and (c) Al1 alloys after dry sliding wear testing at 800 C.\nvery severe adhesive wear occurred during the friction. When the test temperature increased to 500 C, the alloys softened further. However, the wear resistance was higher than that at 200 C. There was obvious oxidation on the worn surface at 500 C. During friction, the oxides prevented direct contact between the alloy matrix and Si3N4 ball to a certain extent, thus delaying additional wear of the alloys [36]. Additionally, although Al0, Al0.5 and Al1 alloys continued to soften at this temperature, the hot hardness decreased by only 13.3%, 24.9% and 19.7%, respectively, and they still maintained a high hardness (especially Al1 alloy). The TEM images of the three alloys after the wear test at 500 C are shown in Fig. 10, and by the statistical analysis from the microstructure, the average grain sizes of the constituent phases in the fine-grained regions were shown in Table 1. It can be seen that the grain growth of the alloys, especially for the Al-containing alloys, was not obvious, and the grain sizes were still considered\nnano/ultrafine-grain grade. The slow diffusion effect of HEAs determines that their grain growths are slower than that of the conventional alloys at high temperature, presenting the good thermal stability [1]. For the Al0.5 and Al1 alloys, the precipitates such as BCC and Al2O3 phases distributing in the alloys can also effectively prevent the grain growth, which led to the better thermal stability than that of Al0 alloy [31]. Therefore, the good wear resistance of the alloys was still maintained at 500 C, which was also due to the high hardness of the nano/ultrafine grains. The wear mechanisms of the alloys at 500 C are explained as follows. With increasing Al content, the wear mechanisms of the alloy gradually transformed from abrasive wear, adhesive wear, plastic extrusionwear and mild oxidation wear to abrasive wear and mild oxidation wear.\nIt is worth noting that the wear resistance of the alloys at 800 C was obviously higher than that at other temperatures, and the wear rates were one order of magnitude less than that at other\n00 C: (a) Al0 alloy, (b) Al0.5 alloy, and (c) Al1 alloy.\ntemperatures. For the Al0.5 and Al1 alloys, the average friction coefficients were the lowest among the alloys studied hereinwith a value of only approximately 0.19, indicating that the two alloys had good antifriction and wear resistance at 800 C. Although the alloys softened obviously at 800 C, wear of the alloys was prevented because of the formation of the continuous and dense oxide films on the worn surfaces and the high bonding strength between the oxide films and the alloy matrixes [9]. Some fine grooves were observed on the worn surface of the Al0 alloy, and the main wear mechanism was abrasive wear and mild oxidation wear. The hardness of the Al0 alloy was the lowest among the alloys studied herein at 800 C (<100 HV), resulting in weakened support of the matrix to the oxide film, so its wear resistance was lower than that of the Al-containing alloys. For the Al-containing alloys, the oxidation resistance were better than that of the Al0 alloy. During friction, the formation of a continuous and dense aluminium oxide film on the worn surface of the alloy prevented the diffusion of oxygen elements to the alloy matrix and the diffusion of the alloy matrix elements to the surface layer [33]. Therefore, the Al0.5 and Al1 alloys with better oxidation resistance and higher hardness showed better wear resistance than that of Al0 alloy, and the main wear mechanism was mild oxidation wear.\nThe room-temperature wear properties of the nano-/ultrafinegrained FeCoCrNiMnAlx HEAs in this work are similar to that of the coarse-grained HEAs such as AlxCoCrFeNi [9]. The addition of Al with high concentration also led to BCC phase precipitate, and thus obviously improved the wear resistance of the alloy. The worn surface of the alloy with high hardness is smoother than that of the low hardness alloy, and the room-temperature wear resistance increase with increase in hardness. Table 4 shows the hot wear data of the nano-/ultrafine-grained HEAs in this work and the coarsegrained HEAs reported in some literatures [9,12,13]. It can be seen that the elevated-temperature wear resistance of the nano-/ultrafine-grained HEAs in this work is better than that of the coarsegrained HEAs, although the hot wear behaviour of the alloys is closely related to the test conditions (the test conditions of the alloys in Table 4 are not exactly the same). The main wear mechanism of the nano-/ultrafine-grained HEAs at elevated temperature is mild oxidation wear. The worn surfaces of the nano-/ultrafinegrained HEAs, especially the Al-containing nano-/ultrafine-grained alloys, are smoother than that of the coarse-grained HEAs. Even for the nano-/ultrafine-grained FeCoCrNiMn HEAwith single FCC solid solution phase, there is only small grooves on the worn surface, which also showing good wear resistance at elevated temperature.\nSuch excellent elevated-temperature wear resistance of the nano-/ultrafine-grained HEAs is attributed to the nano-/ultrafinegrained structure. Firstly, the grain boundary volume fraction of the nano-/ultrafine-grained HEAs is much higher than that of the coarse-grained alloys, which greatly improves the nucleation probability of the oxides at elevated temperature [37,38], and makes it easier to form the continuous and dense oxide film on the worn surface of the nano-/ultrafine-grained alloys (especially the Al-containing alloys). The oxide film can completely separate the alloy matrix from the Si3N4 grinding ball, and thus protect the alloy matrix during friction [13]. Secondly, the slow diffusion effect of HEA endows the alloy with good grain growth resistance at elevated temperature [1]. As previously mentioned, even after the friction test at elevated temperature of 500 C, the grain sizes of the FeCoCrNiMnAlx HEAs are still the nano/ultrafine crystal level. Therefore, the nano-/ultrafine-grained structure of the subsurface region can provide good support for the friction layer in the surface region, and then improve the elevated-temperature wear resistance."

      "text" : "(1) The addition of Al significantly improved the wear resistance of the FeCoCrNiMn HEA. For example, the wear rate of Al1 alloy was 63.7% lower than that of Al0 alloy at room temperature. The good room temperaturewear resistances of the Al-containing alloys are attributed mainly to the grain refinement and BCC phase precipitation. With the increase in the Al content, the main wear mechanisms of the alloy gradually transformed from substantial adhesive wear, abrasive wear and plastic extrusion wear to mild adhesive wear and abrasive wear. (2) The FeCoCrNiMnAlx HEAs had good resistance to softening at elevated temperatures; for example, the hardness of Al0, Al0.5 and Al1 alloys at 500 C decreased only 13.3%, 24.9% and 19.7%, respectively, compared to that at room temperature. The addition of Al significantly improved the oxidation resistance of the alloys. At 800 C, the thickness of the oxide layers of the alloys was reduced from approximately 2 mm to less than 1 mm due to the addition of Al. (3) The good softening and oxidation resistance of the alloys led to good wear resistance at elevated temperatures. The wear rate of the alloys at 800 C was one order of magnitude less than that at room temperature, reaching 10 5 mm3/(N$m).\nFor the Al-containing alloys (such as Al0.5 and Al1), the average friction coefficients were also low (only approximately 0.19), which indicates that the Al-containing alloys showed outstanding antifriction and wear resistance at 800 C. (4) Such excellent elevated-temperature wear resistance of the FeCoCrNiMnAlx HEAs is mainly attributed to the nano-/ultrafine-grained structure. At elevated temperatures, such as 800 C, the nano-/ultrafine-grained structure made it easier to form the continuous and dense oxide film on the worn surface of the alloys (especially the Al-containing alloys), which protected the alloy matrix during dry sliding friction. The main wear mechanisms of the Al0 alloy at 800 C were abrasive wear andmild oxidationwear. For the Al-containing alloys, the main mechanisms transformed into mild oxidation wear.\nContributions\nMr. Hu Cheng conducted the experimental design and analysed the results. In addition, Mr. Hu Cheng, Mr. Yihang Fang, Mr. Jiamin Xu, Mr. Chaode Zhu and Mr. Shuangxi Xue conceived the manuscript. Finally, Prof. Pinqiang Dai reviewed and edited the manuscript.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work."

However, for nano/ultrafine-grained bulk HEAs, there is a lack of understanding of the friction and wear properties. In this work, nano/ultrafine-grained FeCoCrNiMnAlx HEAs were produced by powder metallurgy, and the effects of Al addition and temperature on the friction and wear properties of the alloys were studied. The addition of Al led to grain refinement, body-centered cubic (BCC) phase precipitation and an increased hardness, which significantly improved the wear resistance of the alloys at various temperatures. At elevated temperatures, such as 800 C, the alloys (especially the Alcontaining alloys) exhibited outstanding wear resistance, which was mainly attributed to the formation of the continuous and dense oxide film on the worn surface due to the nano-/ultrafine-grained structure. Additionally, the Al-containing alloys also showed good antifriction properties at 800 C. © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
