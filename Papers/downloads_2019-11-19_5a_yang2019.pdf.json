However, their large-scale application is limited for lacking competent considerable capacity and long-term cycling performance of cathode materials. Herein, we synthesize CuSe nano-particles via a rapid and low-cost microwave-assisted method. When used as cathode material for rechargeable magnesium batteries at 20mA g 1 current density, the CuSe nano-particles can display a remarkable reversible specific capacity at 241.2mA h g 1 at room temperature. Furthermore, the stable capacity of CuSe nano-particles reveal to 200mA h g 1 at 50mA g 1 (60 cycles). More importantly, the CuSe nanoparticles provide long-term cycling stability with reversible capacity maintaining at 107.7mA h g 1 at 100mA g 1 current density over 150 cycles. The rate capacities can be stabilized at 202.7, 201.7, 160.3, and 91.4mA h g 1 at different current densities of 10, 20, 50 and 100mA g 1, respectively. Therefore, the CuSe nano-particles make a possibility in investigating more valuable application prospects for rechargeable magnesium batteries.\n© 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Rechargeable magnesium batteries (rMBs) have attracted great attention as a promising new storage device. The Mg metal anode shows environmental friendliness, high natural abundance, low cost, enough safety and the stability under ambient conditions [1e3]. In the recent years, intensive research has been devoted to multivalent Mg or Al ion battery, which have the ability to storage more energy using the identical number of inserted ions by transfer more than one electron in comparisonwithmonovalent Li or Na ion battery [4,5]. However, Mg2þ ions typically experience significantly higher activation barriers for movement and poor kinetics, resulting in limited discovery of suitable cathode materials [6].\nIn the recent years, various possible cathode materials for rMBs have been proposed, such as transition-metal sulfides (Chevrel phase Mo6S8 [7,8], TiS2 [9,10], VS2 [11]), transition-metal selenide\n.edu.cn (C. Cao).\n(Mo6Se8 [12], TiSe2 [13], VSe2 [13]), transition-metal oxides (V2O5 [14], MnO2 [15,16], MoO3 [17], VOPO4 [18], polyanion compounds XSiO4 (X¼ Fe, Mn, Co) [19e22]). These cathode materials are generally considered from a point of view that Mg ions can be inserted into and released from lattice space of host materials [23]. Transition-metal sulfides provide a low discharge voltage resulting in moderate energy densities. Among them, the unique structure of Chevrel phase materials can the interaction with the Mg2þ and accelerate its diffusion, but low discharge capacity. Transitionmetal oxides causes sluggish electrode kinetics owing to the robust interaction between Mg2þ ions and high polarizing oxide ions, therefore it exhibits higher voltage but unsatisfying cycling endurance [24]. The key to solve the above problems is to study high-performance cathode material.\nRecently findings showed that CuSe not only has high ionic conductivity and enough vacancy for Mg2þ insertion, but also the strong coordination between Se2 anions and Mg2þ cations achieves easier the reversible displacement reaction [23,25]. Comparatively, there has been little research on CuSe as rMBs material. In earlywork, Tashiro [23] showed the cycle ability of micrometer-size\nb Cu2Se electrode for rMBs by solvothermal method between 0.2 and 1.8 V. In the first 35 cycles, the highest capacity during the discharge process was approached to 150mAh g 1 at the current density of 5mA g 1, but it decreased in the later cycles. In addition, the specific capacity stabilized at 200mA h g 1 by downsizing the crystal size (0.5e1 mm), but it only provided four cycles. Therefore, the long cycling stability and high rate performances should be improved. Recently, Yuan [26] prepared rMBs with micro-meter size (1.5e2 mm) SeCu2Se plates and 0.5 mmHeCu2Se plates using solvothermal and hydrothermal method, respectively. Their discharge capacities in the 0.4M (PhMgCl)2 AlCl3/THF electrolyte stabilized at about 80mAh g 1 and 50mAh g 1 at 0.02 C (1 C¼ 260mA g 1), respectively. However, the cycle performance was poor (30 cycles). Moreover, the discharge capacity of Cu2Se decreased from 250 to 100mAh g 1 at 0.1 C in 0.4M (PhMgCl)2 AlCl3 þ 1.0 M LiCl/THF electrolyte after 30 cycles. Thus, it is great important to search a newmaterial to improve reversible capacity and cycle stability for rMBs. On the other hand, it has been proven that one of the useful strategies to promote magnesium ion insertion kinetics is to shorten the diffusion distance [27e30]. The nanostructure can greatly shorten the diffusion distance of Mg2þ, which is more conducive to the rate performance of rMBs. In addition, the nanostructure can release the stress caused by volume expansion, which is conducive to the cycling performance of rMBs. Therefore, the nanostructure as an important factor can improve the contact area between electrodematerial and electrolyte [31,32].\nIn this work, we examine the possibility of CuSe nano-particles obtained through a time-saving and economical microwaveassisted method [33e37]. The diameters of CuSe nano-particles is about 50 nm. The CuSe nano-particles as cathode material for rMBs can show the reversible high performance of 241.2mA h g 1 at 20mA g 1 at room temperature. Moreover, the CuSe nano-particles provide long cycling performance with discharge capacity approaching to 107.7mA h g 1 until 150 cycles at 100mA g 1. Such long cyclic life is firstly reported for CuSe as a cathode material for rMBs. In addition, the stable capacity of CuSe nano-particles reveal to 200mAh g 1 at 50mA g 1. Besides, CuSe nano-particles experience the conversion reaction in rMBs, as evidenced by XRD patterns and HRTEM images. In brief, the approach to prepare nano materials shows potential in the search for Mg cathode candidates. Our work offers the solid basis to improve the electrochemical properties of rMBs."

Then, 1mL hydrazine hydrate (80%) and 2mL NH3$H2O were consecutively added into the mixed solution. The solution was maintained at the pH value of 9 with stirring uniformly.

      "heading" : "3. Results and discussion",
      "text" : "The XRD was employed to research the crystal structure of the sample (Fig. 1a). The products showed obvious characteristic diffraction peaks at 2q¼ 26.4 , 27.9 , 31.1 , 45.9 , 50.0 and 56.5 , correspond to the (111), (112), (006), (200), (118) and (206) crystal planes. Compared to the standard card (JCPDS 27e0184), the diffraction pattern was hexagon phase. The small peaks at around 40 corresponds to crystal planes of Se (JCPDS 47e1515), which is attributed to parts of Se5þ ions in Na2SeO3 are reduced to Se when the hydrazine hydrate is added into the mixed solution in the reaction process, but the production of Se elemental is very low. In addition, the relative ratio of two peaks at about 45 is different from that of standard XRD, which is attributed to CuSe nanoparticles grows preferentially on (200) crystal surface at 45.9 in the process of self-growth [38]. The valence states of CuSe nanoparticles was determined by XPS. In the high-resolution Cu 2p spectrum, two robust peaks located at 931.7 and 951.6 eV as shown in Fig. 1b, corresponding to Cu2þ 2p3/2 and Cu2þ 2p1/2 of CuSe, respectively [39]. Fig. 1c showed that two peaks in the Se 2p spectrum centered at 54.5 and 53.7 eV which be attributed to Se2 2d3/2 and Se2 2d5/2, respectively [40]. The structure and morphology of the CuSe nano-particles were\nobserved by SEM, TEM, and HRTEM. The SEM images demonstrated a mass of dispersed nanoparticles with good uniformity and stability (Fig. 2a, b and 2c). Fig. 2d and e described typical TEM images of the product, which discovered that the particle size of the product is about 50 nm. The HRTEM image revealed lattice fringes of 0.32, 0.28 and 0.20 nm, which are corresponding to the lattice spacing of (112), (006) and (200) planes in CuSe crystal, respectively (Fig. 2f). In addition, the diffraction points appeared hexagonwhich\nrevealed their monocrystalline feature in the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) image (Fig. 2g) [38]. The pore structure and specific surface area of CuSe nano-particles was investigate by the N2 adsorptionedesorption isotherms. The CuSe nano-particles exhibited BET specific surface area of 11.1m2 g 1 (Fig. S1a). According to the pore size distribution result, one clear peak were observed at about 2.32 nm pore diameter by using the BarrettJoyner-Halenda (BJH) method, which be caused by the stacking between each nano-particle (Fig. S1b).\nTo investigate the storage properties of the CuSe nano-particles, CV and charge-discharge tests were carried out. The CV test proved the non-corrosive of stainless-steel in the 0.25MMg (AlCl2EtBu)2/ THF electrolyte in the voltage range from 0.2 to 2 V (Fig. S2) [41]. According the previous literature reported byMizrahi et al. [42], the compatibility of Mg foil with electrolyte in magnesium battery systemwas evaluated, inwhich the overpotential for Mg deposition is close to 255mV, and the efficiency of Mg deposition-dissolution of 0.25MMg(AlCl2BuEt)2 electrolyte stable at ~100%. As shown in Fig. 3a, the typical CV curves of CuSe nano-particles electrode was evaluated at a scan rate of 0.1mV s 1 within voltage of 0.2e2 V. During the first discharge process, an obvious reduction peak centered at ~1.2 V which could be ascribed that CuSe begins to transform into MgxCuSe due to the insertion of Mg2þ. The other clear reduction peak observed at ~0.78 V which could be attributed to MgxCuSe reduce to Cu2Se and MgSe. A weak reduction peak at ~0.4 V could be related to the transformation of Cu2Se to Cu and MgSe [24].Nevertheless, the subsequent cycles was different from the 1st cathodic scan. From 2 to 4 cycles, the cathodic peak at ~1.2 V strengthened gradually, indicating that the activation process of\nCuSe nano-particles electrode increases progressively [43].The cathodic peak at ~0.78 V shifted to a high voltage value of ~0.8 V and the shape of peaks at ~0.8 V almost overlapped each other during subsequent scanning cycles, signifying that the CuSe electrode has a good reversibility and stability [44].In the anodic scan, two weak oxidation peaks appeared respectively at ~1.5 V and ~1.4 V, suggesting that MgSe was transformed into different phases of Cu2Se. It's worth noting that a major oxidation peak emerged evidently at ~1.88 V, which be related to the transformation of Cu2Se to CuSe [24].Based on thementioned results, themain charge and discharge reaction process could be defined as follow [23,24,43,45].\n2CuSeþMg2þþ2e 4Cu2Se þMgSe (1)\nCu2SeþMg2þþ2e 4MgSeþ 2Cu (2) Therefore, the whole cells reaction mechanism could be\nexpressed by the following equations:\nCuSeþMg4CuþMgSe (3) In the further analysis, CV curves at different scanning speeds\nwere tested (Fig. S3). The CV curves exhibit similarly reversible oxidation and reduction peaks, proving that CuSe electrode material has excellent rate performance [24].\nThe charge-discharge measurements of CuSe nano-particles between 0.2 and 2.0 were recorded at 50mA g 1 current density. In particular, the reduction peaks in CV curves were consistent with the three voltage plateaus of discharge profiles, respectively\n(Fig. 3b), indicating multistep phase transform of CuSe nanoparticles. The charging and discharging platform could be clearly seen, indicating that CuSe nano-particles are highly reversible. As shown in the Fig. 3c, the cathode provided an initial discharge capacity of 154.1mA h g 1. The initial coulombic efficiency (CE) was 96.24% which is seldom obtained in the current studies, because of less side reaction between the materials and electrolyte [2]. During the following cycles, the charge and discharge capacities were basically flat and their capacities were gradually rising due to activation upon of the electrode materials and the polarization decreases [46]. The polarization of CuSe electrode is lower than the references reported CuS electrode by Xiong et al. [47]. Obviously, the discharge capacity appeared a maximum value of 223.1mA h g 1 which is higher than the references reported CuS electrode byWu et al. [46] in the 30th cycle. The discharge capacity decreased slightly until stable at 200mA h g 1 as the cycling progressed.\nFig. 3d showed rate capability of the CuSe nano-particles measured at various current densities from 10 to 100mA g 1. The maximum discharge capacities (203 and 201.7mA h g 1) could be obtained at the lower current densities of 10 and 20mA g 1, respectively. The reversible capacity went down slightly at the high\ncurrent densities of 50 and 100mA g 1. Remarkably, when the testing current density back to 10mA g 1, the discharge capacity of CuSe nano-particles could achieve a stable value of 226.1mA h g 1. In comparison with the 1e5 cycles, the discharge capacity during the following 21e24 cycles became higher, which could be attributed to the increased activation of CuSe nano-particles electrode [48]. Fig. 3e showed the corresponding charge-discharge curves with the discharge capacities maintain at 202.7, 201.7, 160.3, and 91.4mA h g 1 at 10, 20, 50 and 100mA g 1, respectively. These consequences indicate that the CuSe electrode not only has excellent rate performance, but also the polarization increases with the changing of current densities.\nFig. 3f showed the cycling performance and corresponding CE of the CuSe nano-particles at a current density of 100mA g 1. The charge and discharge capacities reached to 60.7 and 61.8mA h g 1\nthat the initial CE were 98.22% in the first cycle, respectively. From the second cycle, the specific capacity increased gradually until the 25th cycle reached a stable period. In the 133rd cycle, a maximum value of 126.8mA h g 1 with a CE of 100% was appeared on the discharge capacity. After 150 cycles, CuSe nano-particles still maintained the charge capacity of 106.8 and discharge capacity of 107.7mA h g 1, respectively. To check the contribution of carbon\npaper to capacity of rMBs, we measured the reversible capacity of carbon paper at 100mA g 1 which was much lower than CuSe nano-particles electrode (Fig. S4). In addition, the specific capacity of CuSe nano-particles increased after 5th CV activation at the current density of 100mA g 1 (Fig. S5).\nFig. S6 showed the short-term cycling performance and chargedischarge curves at 20mA g 1 current density. The CuSe nanoparticles electrode exhibited the initial discharge capacity of 237.1mA h g 1. After the 10th cycles, the discharge capacity of the CuSe electrode stabilized at 241.2mA h g 1. The actually capacity is 64% of the theoretical capacity which could be attributed to the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) [49]. Similar to the charge-discharge curves with high current density, it had obvious discharge voltage platforms. These electrical properties are based on that nanoparticles can effectively decrease volume expansion and maintain structural stability. Table 1 exhibited a comparison of cycling performance of the CuSe cathode and other transition metal selenide materials for rMBs in recent publication paper. Compared with previous studies, the excellent electrochemical properties of CuSe nano-particles were superior to Cu2Se.\nFor compared, the electrochemical measurements of commercial CuSe was studied at the current density of 50mA g 1. The discharge capacity of commercial CuSe was stable at 25mA h g 1\nwithin 30 cycles, as shown in Fig. 4a. Obviously, it was much lower than the discharge capacity of CuSe nano-particles (Fig. 3c). In addition, the polarization of commercial CuSe electrode was larger than the CuSe nano-particles (Fig. 4b). To furthermore investigate the cause of this phenomenon, the XRD and SEM measurement were carried out in detail. By comparing with XRD, the strong peak of commercial CuSe was shown in 2q¼ 31.1 corresponding to the (006) plane (Fig. 4c), but the CuSe nano-particles exposed the strong peak of 2q¼ 45.9 corresponding to the (200) plane (Fig. 1a). With the oriented growth of (200) crystal surface, more active sites were exposed, which is beneficial to the diffusion of Mg2þ. The commercial CuSe exhibit a specific surface area of 5.0m2 g 1, which is much lower than CuSe nano-particles, further suggesting that CuSe nano-particles expose more active cites to increase charge transfer areas between the electrode and the electrolyte (Fig. S7). [50] The SEM image of commercial CuSe showed a large number of different blocks ranging from 1 to 10 mm (Fig. 4d), which size is larger than the CuSe nano-particles. The formation of blocks structure by stacking of the particles lead to heavy mass and the utilization rate of materials is limited. Moreover, the interior charge transfer is not easy for this structure [51]. However, such small size structures of CuSe nano-particles can facilitate charge transfer, shorten the ion diffusion length, and increase the interface between electrolytes and activate materials [24]. In a word, the small size and light weight of CuSe nano-particles are important features for its good performance.\nIn order to further explore the charging and discharging mechanism, the structural transition and phase evolution of CuSe\nnano-particles upon Mg2þ ions insertion and extraction were investigated by XRD, TEM, and HRTEM. The XRD patterns of CuSe nano-particles electrode after different cycles as shown in Fig. 5a. At the fresh electrode, the peaks marked at 27.9 , 31.1 , 40.7 , 45.9 , 50.0 and 56.5 are tended to the CuSe phase (JCPDS 27e0184). Compared with the fresh electrode, the intensities of CuSe peaks at the 1st discharged to 0 V decreased dramatically lead to the parts of CuSe phases disappear and Cu2Se phases appear at 47.5 (JCPDS 29e0575) and 44.9 (JCPDS 88e2043) during magnesiation process. After 10th charged to 2 V, the phases of CuSe were weaker than the 1st charged to 2 V, which is caused by the uncomplete conversion reaction from CuSe to Cu2Se, so the capacity of CuSe also have improving space [46].The peaks of MgSe and Cu could be observed at 32.8 and 43.3 after the 10th discharged to 0 V (JCPDS 18e0777 and JCPDS 04e0836), respectively, which be likely to Mg2þ embedded in CuSe occupies the lattice position of the Cu2þ in CuSe. As the 1st and 10th charged to 2 V, a series of peaks appeared: the ones at 39.8 , 44.9 , 47.5 and 51.6 could be indexed to Cu2Se phase, indicating that parts of Cu2Se are formed to replace the CuSe during Mg2þ extraction reaction [46]. Fig. 5b showed the image of CuSe corresponding Cu, Mg, and Se elemental mapping in fully discharged state, the elements were uniformly distributed in the nano-particles, shown that magnesium reaction occurs during discharge process. Furthermore, the crystal lattice of CuSe nanoparticles was not destroyed and the morphology was not changed after cycling (Fig. S8), indicating that thematerial structure is stable enough, due to the nano-micro structure of CuSe are stacked together to improve the activity and stability of materials [52]. As displayed in Fig. 5c, a series of spacing lattice fringes with 0.182, 0.191, 0.273 and 0.209 could be found, corresponding to the (118) planes of CuSe, (116) planes of Cu2Se, (200) planes of MgSe and (111) planes of metallic Cu, respectively. These XRD patterns results correspond well with the CV curves."

However, their large-scale application is limited for lacking competent considerable capacity and long-term cycling performance of cathode materials. Herein, we synthesize CuSe nano-particles via a rapid and low-cost microwave-assisted method. When used as cathode material for rechargeable magnesium batteries at 20mA g 1 current density, the CuSe nano-particles can display a remarkable reversible specific capacity at 241.2mA h g 1 at room temperature. Furthermore, the stable capacity of CuSe nano-particles reveal to 200mA h g 1 at 50mA g 1 (60 cycles). More importantly, the CuSe nanoparticles provide long-term cycling stability with reversible capacity maintaining at 107.7mA h g 1 at 100mA g 1 current density over 150 cycles. The rate capacities can be stabilized at 202.7, 201.7, 160.3, and 91.4mA h g 1 at different current densities of 10, 20, 50 and 100mA g 1, respectively. Therefore, the CuSe nano-particles make a possibility in investigating more valuable application prospects for rechargeable magnesium batteries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
