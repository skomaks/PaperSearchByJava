      "text" : "Asphalt mixture is one of the most important materials in pavement engineering. The demand for asphalt binder continues to grow with large-scale pavement construction and maintenance; however, the reserves of asphalt binder are decreasing worldwide, owing to the exhaustion of petroleum resources. Hence, there is a need to study alternative materials to reduce the consumption of asphalt binder, and to meet the technical requirements for pavement construction.\nBio-oil has been introduced as a replacement for traditional asphalt materials, owing to its\nadvantages in environmental protection, low costs, and abundant resources. The physicochemical characteristics and pavement properties of different types of bio-oil modified asphalt binders have been extensively analyzed in recent years [1–12]. The results have revealed that\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238817 September 4, 2020 1 / 16\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Ren J, Zang G, Wang S, Shi J, Wang Y (2020) Investigating the pavement performance and aging resistance of modified bio-asphalt with nano-particles.

Siyuan Wang: National University Student Innovation Program of China under grants\nbio-oil modified asphalt binders can provide better low-temperature performance than traditional asphalt binders, as the bio-oil alleviates the thermal stress more easily [13]. However, the high-temperature stabilities of bio-oil modified asphalt binders are unsatisfactory. Fini et al. [1] discovered that a bio-asphalt binder might decrease the high-temperature grade of asphalt binders. Gao et al. [2], Sun et al. [3,4], Yong et al. [5], Wang et al. [6], and Dhasmana et al. [7] found that the bio-oils weakened the stiffness and temperature stability of asphalt binders at high temperatures. Mirhosseini et al. [8] indicated that the high-temperature performance of a bio-asphalt binder could be adversely affected owing to the softening effect of bio-oil. Lei et al. [9,10] demonstrated that at high temperatures, asphalt mastics modified with bio-oils exhibited relatively low rheological performance. Yang et al. [11] and Mohammad et al. [12] discovered that the rutting resistance of a bio-asphalt mixture was not better than that of a base asphalt mixture. Hence, it is important to develop a technology for enhancing the high-temperature performance of bio-oil modified asphalt binders.\nIn recent years, nanomaterials (i.e., materials with at least one dimension within 1–100 nm)\nhave exhibited novel properties owing to the nature of their large specific surface areas, high surface free energies, and satisfactory dispersion abilities, attracting attention from engineers. These unique properties of nano-materials can provide a bridge between macroscopic materials and molecular structures to improve the mechanical, thermodynamic, and chemical properties of a material. Existing studies show that nano-materials can successfully modify asphalt binders to improve the pavement performance, especially the high-temperature performance [14–25]. Particularly, the effects from the nano-particles are more significant, owing to the much larger surface area per unit mass as a nanomaterial decreases in size. For instance, nanoCaCO3 particles [14,15], nano-ZnO particles [16,17], nano-TiO2 particles [18,19], nano-SiO2 particles [20,21], and nano-Fe2O3 particles [22,23] have been widely investigated for the preparation of nano-modified asphalt binders and have exhibited satisfactory results. It is reasonable to speculate that nano-particles could also be used to improve the high-temperature performance of bio-asphalt binders.\nHowever, there is relatively little literature addressing the relationship between nano-parti-\ncles and bio-asphalt binders. Thus, this study conducts a series of traditional tests and rolling thin film oven tests (RTFOTs) for different modified asphalt binders with nano-particles to examine their high-temperature performance, low-temperature performance, and aging resistance, and to evaluate the most effective type of nano-particles."

      "text" : "According to the Chinese technical specification “Technical specification for construction of highway asphalt pavements (JTG F40-2004)” [26], the 25˚C penetration is used to confirm the grading level of the asphalt binder. The softening point is used to evaluate the high-temperature performance of the asphalt binder. The 5˚C ductility is used to evaluate the low-temperature performance of the asphalt binder. The 135˚C dynamic viscosity is used to evaluate the workable performance of the asphalt binder, and it must be lower than 3.0 Pa�s. The workable performance refers to the ability of the asphalt binder to mix with aggregates conveniently during the preparation process of asphalt mixture to ensure the uniformity of the asphalt mixture. The mass loss, 25˚C residual penetration ratio and 5˚C ductility after aging, obtained via RTFOTs, are used to evaluate the aging resistance of the asphalt binder.\nThe dynamic stability, obtained via rutting test, is used to verify the high-temperature stability of the asphalt mixture. The fracture strain, obtained via bending test at -10˚C, is used to verify the low-temperature crack resistance of the asphalt mixture. The residual stability, obtained via immersing Marshall test, is used to verify the water stability of the asphalt mixture. The water stability refers to the ability of the asphalt mixture to resist damages (e.g., loosening and pit slot) from water erosion.\nAll the tests are conducted in accordance with the Chinese test standard “Standard test methods of bitumen and bituminous mixtures for highway engineering (JTG E20-2011)” [27].\nPreparation of the modified bio-asphalt binders\nBased on the principle of dissolution in a similar material structure, it is easy to mix the bio-oil with the base asphalt binder completely. However, owing to the large specific surface area and high surface energy, nano-materials have a great inclination to agglomerate and form secondary particles. This agglomeration behavior causes negative modification effects. Hence, it is necessary to disperse the nanomaterials uniformly to overcome the agglomeration problem. In this study, in accordance with our previous study [28,29], a high-temperature, high-speed shearing method is adopted to address the agglomeration issue.\nThe modified asphalt binders that use nano-particles and bio-oil are manufactured as follows. The bio-oil and base asphalt binder are mixed, thereby forming the bio-asphalt binder. The total mass of the bio-oil and base asphalt binder is 500 g and is kept constant. Then, the nano-modified bio-asphalt binders are prepared after adding and mixing nano-particles via 10 min of high-speed shearing (5000 r/min) at 120˚C.\nPavement properties of modified bio-asphalt binders\nThe test results of 25˚C penetration, softening point, 5˚C ductility, and 135˚C dynamic viscosity of the different asphalt binders are shown in Table 6.\nAs shown in Table 6, it can be found that: Fig 1 displays the trend of 25˚C penetration with different nano-particle dosages. The 25˚C\npenetrations of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binders decrease linearly as the nano-particle dosages increase. Moreover, compared to the bio-asphalt binder, the decrease in the 25˚C penetration is the most when nano-SiO2 is used, and is the least when nano-CaCO3 is used.\nThe softening points of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binders increase as the nano-particle\ndosages increase, showing the positive effect of the nano-particles on the high-temperature performance of a bio-asphalt binder. However, the modified effects of different nano-particles become insignificant with the increased nano-particle dosages, particularly when the dosage is larger than 0.5%. The trends tend to flatten with increased nano-particle dosages, and there is less of a difference with a change of the nano-particles. Among the tested five types of nanoparticles, nano-SiO2 has the best modified effect on the softening point and nano-ZnO is the worst. The difference is owing to the difference in the specific surface areas, implying that nano-particles with a higher specific surface area can provide a better modifying effect on the high-temperature performance of nano-modified bio-asphalt binders.\nAn asphalt binder can be treated as a mix of three types of distributed systems: a matrix\nphase, dispersed phase, and bee-like structure. The softening point of the asphalt binder increases as the proportion of the matrix phase increases, and the 5˚C ductility and 25˚C penetration increase as the proportion of the dispersed phase increase [30–35]. Evidently, the proportion of the dispersed phase in the asphalt binder increases with the addition of bio-oil [30]. Hence, the 5˚C ductility and 25˚C penetration of the bio-asphalt binder increase with an increased proportion of bio-oil, and the softening point decreases accordingly. In addition, owing to the large specific surface area, the nano-particles fuse with the dispersed phase and bee-like structure well [31,32] and accelerate the transformation from the dispersed phase and bee-like structure to the matrix phase [31,33] (particularly for the bee-like structure). This makes the asphalt binder less prone to deformation, softening, and flowing, so that the nanoparticles can improve the softening point of the bio-asphalt binder and reduce the 25˚C penetration. Moreover, the aforementioned action of the nano-particles is more significant when the specific surface area of nano-particles is increased. Hence, nano-SiO2 displays the best modification effect for the bio-asphalt binder.\npoints of the nano-modified asphalt binders decrease approximately linearly as the bio-oil dosage increases.\nFig 3 displays the trend of 5˚C ductility with different nano-particle dosages. The 5˚C ductilities of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binders decrease linearly as the nano-particle dosages increase, indicating the adverse effect of the nano-particles on the low-temperature performance of the bio-asphalt binder. This occurs because the proportion of the dispersed phase of the bio-asphalt decreases with the addition of nano-particles, as previously mentioned.\nThis trend is not affected by the bio-oil dosage. However, although nano-particles have a\ndisadvantageous effect on the low-temperature performance, the 5˚C ductilities of the different nano-modified bio-asphalt binders are evidently better than that of the AH-70, showing the satisfactory low-temperature stability of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binders. Furthermore, the 5˚C ductility of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binder using nano-CaCO3 is the highest, and those using SiO2 and TiO2 are the lowest. In addition, the 5˚C ductilities of the nano-modified asphalt binders increase as the bio-oil dosage increase, and the trend is more evident with increased bio-oil dosages.\nThe 135˚C dynamic viscosities of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binders increase slightly as\nthe nano-particle dosages increase. However, the 135˚C dynamic viscosities among all of the groups of experimental tests are always at a low level (lower than 1.0 Pa�s), meeting the Chinese specifications (� 3.0 Pa�s) [26].\nRTFOTs for evaluating the anti-aging performance of modified bio-asphalt binders\nThe mass loss, 25˚C residual penetration ratio and 5˚C ductility after aging, obtained via RTFOTs, are shown in Table 7.\nAs shown in Table 7, with increased nano-particle dosages, the mass losses of the nanomodified bio-asphalt binders decrease linearly and the residual penetration ratios increase accordingly, showing that nano-particles can improve the aging resistance of bio-asphalt binders. The enhancement effects from nano-SiO2 and nano-Fe2O3 are superior to those of the other nano-particles, and those of nano-CaCO3 and nano-ZnO are relatively weak. Moreover, after aging of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binders, the 5˚C ductilities decrease as the nanoparticle dosages increase, which may be owing to the negative effect of the nano-particles on these 5˚C ductilities without aging. To explore further the effects of the nano-particles on the 5˚C ductilities after aging, the loss ratios for the 5˚C ductility ratio are calculated using Eq (1) and shown in Fig 4.\nRa ¼ jD D 0 j=D� 100% ð1Þ\nWhere, Ra is the loss ratio of the 5˚C ductility, D is the 5˚C ductility without aging, and D' is the 5˚C ductility after aging.\nAs shown in Fig 4, the loss ratios of the 5˚C ductility of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binders\ndecrease as the nano-particle dosages increase, indicating that the nano-particles provide the\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238817 September 4, 2020 5 / 16\nimproved the aging resistance of bio-asphalt binders. This reduction trend of the loss ratio is more evident with increased bio-oil dosages. The above law is the most significant for nanoTiO2, and that for ZnO is the most insignificant. Moreover, on the whole, the loss ratios of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binders using nano-SiO2 are the lowest and those using nano-CaCO3 are the highest, showing the same law as the mass loss and the residual penetration ratio.\nThe mechanism of asphalt aging comprises the volatilization and transformation of the dispersed phase under the action of high temperatures and ultraviolet irradiation [34,35]. As previously mentioned, the proportion of the dispersed phase decreases with the addition of the nano-particles; thus the aging resistance of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binder is improved.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238817.g001\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238817.g002\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238817 September 4, 2020 7 / 16\nPavement properties of modified asphalt mixtures\nThe aggregate gradation showed in Fig 5 is used in all types of asphalt mixtures. The dynamic stabilities, fracture strains and residual stabilities of the nano-modified bio-asphalt mixtures are listed in Table 8.\nAs shown in Table 8, it can be found that: The effects of the five nano-particles on the dynamic stabilities of the nano-modified bio-\nasphalt mixtures are similar to those on the softening points of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binders. This indicates the positive effect of the five nano-particles on the high-temperature stabilities. To investigate the composite effect of the nano-particles and bio-oil on the hightemperature stability in a through manner, the dynamic stability ratios of the nano-modified bio-asphalt mixtures are calculated using Eq (2), as shown in Fig 6. The dynamic stability ratios reflect the strengthening effects of the different nano-particles on the dynamic stability.\nDRi ¼ Si=Sd ð2Þ\nwhere, DRi is the dynamic stability ratio of the nano-modified bio-asphalt mixtures with i% nano-particles (i = 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8), Si is the dynamic stability of the nano-modified bio-asphalt mixtures with i% nano-materials, and Sd is the dynamic stability of the bio-asphalt mixtures without nano-particles.\nAs shown in Fig 6, the five nano-particles (at the different dosage levels) show a similar\ntrend, i.e., that the strengthening effects on the dynamic stabilities increase linearly as the biooil dosage increased. Overall, nano-SiO2 is the best, and nano-ZnO is the worst (the differences of nano-TiO2, nano-CaCO3, nano-Fe2O3, nano-ZnO are limited).\nThe fracture strains of the nano-modified bio-asphalt mixtures decrease as the nano-parti-\ncle dosages increase, indicating the adverse effect of the nano-particles on the low-temperature crack resistance. The decreasing trends tend to flatten with increased nano-particle dosages. Moreover, the fracture strains of the nano-modified bio-asphalt mixtures are still evidently higher than those of the base asphalt mixture. To analyze the composite effect of the nano-particles and bio-oil on the low-temperature crack resistance of the nano-modified bio-asphalt mixtures further, the loss ratios of the fracture strains of the nano-modified bio-asphalt\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238817.g003\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238817 September 4, 2020 8 / 16\nmixtures are calculated using Eq (3), as shown in Fig 7. The loss ratios reflect the effects of the different nano-particles.\nRi ¼ jF0i Fj\nF � 100% ð3Þ\nwhere, Ri is the loss ratio of the fracture strain of the nano-modified bio-asphalt mixtures with i% nano-particles (i = 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8), F is the fracture strain of the bio-asphalt mixtures without nano-particles, and Fi' is the fracture strain of the nano-modified bio-asphalt mixtures with i% nano-particles.\nAs shown in Fig 7, the negative effects of the nano-particles on the fracture strain decrease\nas bio-oil dosages increase. However, the trends of the loss ratios for the five nano-particles are identical. For nano-SiO2 and nano-CaCO3, this trend gradually tends to be linear with an increased bio-oil dosage. For nano-TiO2, nano-CaCO3, and nano-Fe2O3, the trend of the loss ratio is not evidently affected by the bio-oil dosage. It is relatively stable when the nano-particle dosage is lower than 0.5%. Overall, the negative effect of nano-SiO2 is the highest, and that of nano-CaCO3 is the lowest.\nThe residual stabilities of the different modified bio-asphalt mixtures are similar to each\nother but higher than that of the AH-70 base asphalt mixture, indicating the improved modified effectiveness of the nano-particles on the water stability.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238817.g004\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238817.g005\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238817 September 4, 2020 10 / 16\nThe water stabilities of the different modified bio-asphalt mixtures are similar to each other\nbut higher than that of the AH-70 base asphalt mixture, thereby demonstrating the positive modification effect of the asphalt binder on the water stability."
