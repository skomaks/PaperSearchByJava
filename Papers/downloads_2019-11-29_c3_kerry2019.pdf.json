      "text" : "Emergence of new virus and their heterogeneity are growing at an alarming rate. Sudden outburst of Nipah virus (NiV) has raised serious question about their instant management using conventional medication and diagnostic measures. A coherent strategy with versatility and comprehensive perspective to confront the rising distress could perhaps be effectuated by implementation of nanotechnology. But in concurrent to resourceful and precise execution of nano-based medication, there is an ultimate need of concrete understanding of the NIV pathogenesis. Moreover, to amplify the effectiveness of nano-based approach in a conquest against NiV, a list of developed nanosystem with antiviral activity is also a prerequisite. Therefore the present review provides a meticulous cognizance of cellular and molecular pathogenesis of NiV. Conventional as well several nano-based diagnosis experimentations against viruses have been discussed. Lastly, potential efficacy of different forms of nano-based systems as convenient means to shield mankind against NiV has also been introduced. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the expendability and plasticity in nanotechnological application, there is a wide gap in intrigue experimental biomedical application and their substantial commercialization. Moreover, their application in biomedical science is still lurking, and should be prioritized in order to bridge the gap. Additionally, the efficacy of conventional therapies is gradually fading away specifically in case of viral infections due to the development of resistance,1 which could be certainly due to accelerated adaptation in peripheral protein sequence resulting in newfangled viral strain.

Later a variation of coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome and human metapneumovirus, lately recognized as a new respiratory pathogen over the entire age range has emerged.2\nAnd presently Nipah virus (NiV) another respiratory tract infecting virus with an estimated case fatality rate ranging from 40% to 75% is causing serious issue through the world.3 As indicated by WHO fact-sheet report, lower respiratory infection is ranked 1st and 6th leading cause of mortalities in low income countries and high income countries, respectively, and 4th leading cause of mortalities worldwide.4 The BSL-4 virus with this high rate of morbidity and mortality, up to some extent has strangled the virologist since past 10 years or so for the exigency for a novel therapeutics.5 Moreover, the conventional unidirectional serological diagnosis and therapeutics orchestrate numeral shortcomings such as cost deficit, sophisticated preparation procedures, efficient only on postexposure prophylaxis and reduced amount of the product in consistent with human population and livestock to be vaccinated.5,6\nMajority of the therapeutics developed basically includes monoclonal antibodies targeting viral surface proteins such as F, G or M proteins.7–9 Further a number of broad spectrum antiviral agents\nging viral (NIPAH virus) infection.

This technology harbors certain fascinating properties such as superparamagnetism, high surface plasmon resonance, luminescence, photon upconversion, bioavailability, biocompatibility, immunocompatibility / tolerability and biodegradability. The capacity to channelize through translucently breachable blood–brain barrier (BBB) and blood–air barrier (BAB), tunability and targeted control discharge are chief exclusive points which qualify them to be novel candidate for their utilization in biomedical therapy (antiviral).1,12 The focal point of present review paper includes cellular molecular pathogenesis of NiV infection. Heterogeneous forms of nano-based approaches used as a means of therapy or diagnostic against other viruses, and finally, provised the future possibilities for nanotechnology in concern with the NiV detection and inhibition.\nCellular and molecular changes in NiV infection\nIn humans, severe acute respiratory sickness and/ or encephalitis can be provoked by a bat-borne zoonotic, paramyxoviral pathogen NiV.13,14 This negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus and is closely related to Hendra viruses.13,15 Like Hendra virus, NiV may also cause fatal pneumonia or an acute respiratory-distress-like syndrome.13,16 It has been hypothesized that the respiratory disease transmission and pathogenesis are linked to infection of epithelial cells by the NiV at lower respiratory tract at the primary phase.17 Recently Escaffre et al have described two types of infection in association to NiV, namely NiV-M and NiV-B of human respiratory tract based on differentiated epithelial models of trachea and small airways due to their close anatomical resemblance with epithelial cells of human lower respiratory tract.13 According to the epidemiological reports NiV-M and NiV-B infections vary greatly in multiple aspects.18 For instance the percentage of respiratory disease and case fatality rate of NiV-B infections is much higher than NiV-M infection,19\nwhereas in NiV-M infection studies show that both human and hamster develop similar pathological changes such as presence of vasculitis, necrosis and inflammation. And certain neuronal changes such as antigen positive neurons, microvascular vasculitis and necrosis in hamster which in case of human progresses to encephalitis.18,20\nAn extracellular pleomorphic bilayer envelope spiked with two glycoproteins namely trimeric fusion protein (F) and tetrameric attachment protein (G) at the exterior surface and matrix proteins (M) at the interior surface, encapsulates NiV virion.16,21,22 Further, the negative-sense single-stranded RNA, along with three other critically vital proteins namely nucleo-\ncapsid proteins (N), phosphoproteins (P) and large polymerase proteins (L) is contained within the virion made up of linear ribonucleoprotein (RNP).21 Binding of viral G to the conserved receptors ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 marks the beginning of host cell and viral membrane fusion mediated by prior complex formation of viral G and F protein.22\nFrom an evolutionary point of view it could be assumed that, during initial epidemic period of NiV, it has developed a specific mechanism to evade innate immune action of Pterous bat. The evolutionary conservation of this particular immune mechanism within all mammals has made NiV a broad spectrum virus against them.23,24 The virus blocks the elicitation of innate and adaptive immune response by inhibiting synthesis of cytokines, interferon type I (IFN α/β).25 The IFN α/β in case of viral infection, activate pathways within the viral infected cell which degrades viral mRNA and inhibits viral protein synthesis, hence hindering the rate of viral replication inside the infected cell and subsequently lowering viral load.26,27 Song et al describe that IFN α/β can act as both autocrine and paracrine signaling molecule, where IFN α and IFN β are producers.28 Therefore it could be said that inhibition of IFN α/β synthesis may severely affect both autocrine and paracrine activity, which may further lead to impaired immune response (Barth et al 2016).29 The cellular and molecular changes during and post NiV infection starting right from NiV attachment and invasive pathogenesis leading to multiple organ failure have been explained in the Figures 1, 2, and 3. Understanding these changes will significantly improve present knowledge essential for developing and evaluating therapeutics against NiV."

      "text" : "NiV infection in the primary stage is restricted within the epithelial cells of host's upper and lower respiratory tract.17 And NiV-F and G necessary for its fusion with the bipolar epithelial cell are at the epical side during initial infection period.30 Here, G protein induced virus-cell fusion begins with the interaction between tetrameric G-protein head region and Ephrin B2/B3 on the epithelial cell. Simultaneously C-terminus region of G interacts with NiV-F protein, whose two hydrophobic N-terminal alpha helical heptad repeat domains (HR-1, HR-2) form a sixhelical bundle structure that transverses through cell membrane of the host initiating pH independent class I type membrane fusion (Figure 2).31–33 After the viral entrance through apical region, it replicates within the cell, sorting of proteins such as F and G on infected cell surface, is further destined for infection could also be regarded as markers.32,33 Unlike G, precursor form of F protein, F0 get lodged within the membrane and activated through endocytosis followed by cathepsin L mediated endosomal degradation to form mature F1/2 (Cifuentes-Muñoz et al 2017).34\nThe local infection starts with the lateral spreading of virus occurred by basolaterally expressed protein (G, F) mediated cell– cell merging that gives rise to a consequential configuration of syncytia which are pathological hallmarks for NiV infection of epithelial cells. This has been seen at 14 h of post infection (p.i) which is the earliest time needed for protein detection in in vivo study.30 The cell–cell fusion can be between epithelial cell and\nstromal cell, heterologous fusion or between two epithelial cells, homologous fusion (Figure 2).35 After disrupting monolayer epithelial cells the newly formed virus buds out from the apical side of themultinucleated epithelial cells. This vectorial release of virus is confirmed by the preferential localization of viral F, G and necessary for budding, M protein on the apical side (88%, 86%, 95%of total G, F andM respectively), which can be seen after 24 h p.i.30 The released virus can either infect the immune cells of secondary lymphoid organs (Mucosal Associated Lymphoid Tissues [MALT], Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissues [GALT]) which are present just under the layer of mucosal epithelia cells. They might also contribute towards impairing antiviral activity by inhibiting synthesis of IFN α/β and reducing expression of cytokines involved in inflammatory process like CCL4, CCL5 and TNF-α. Again IFN induced antiviral genes such as MxA, ISG54 and repression of viral antigen presenting class-I MHC molecules might be another output (Figure 3, D).36,37 The unconstrained virus could infiltrate the blood stream attaching to leukocytes such as macrophages, dendritic cells, CD6+CD8+\nT cells, NK cells causing systemic infection and multiple organ failure in detailed brain, lungs, liver, heart, kidney and spleen ((Figure 1).38 Histopathological lesions are necrosis and vasculitis in non-CNS organs. In case of CNS organs, perivascular cuffing, parenchymal inflammation and neurophangia are most common\nclinical signs, but are not exclusive for NiV infection and may also be detected in other acute viral encephalitis (Figure 1).36,39"

      "text" : "With mortality rate of 40%-75% and an outrageous range of host, this atrocious human pathogen also infects neurons apart from endothelial cells.40 In general, paramyxoviruses evade host immune system either by suppressing its detection through lowering the expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRS) or by impeding the secretion of antiviral signaling molecules.37 In case of NiV, viral P gene encoded post-transcriptionally modified phosphoproteins antagonize the secretion of IFN α/β and elicit antiviral activity at both cytoplasm and nucleolus.37,41 The various proteins encoded by P genes are P, V, W and C with 407 amino acid length similarity at their N terminal end.41 V and W mRNAs are frame shift mutates P mRNA at a particular conservation site, with insertion of one and two G nucleotide respectively whereas the C mRNA is nested within each P, V, W mRNA.37,42\nThe degree of immune response inhibition by each proteins P, V, W varies with P being less than V and W with highest inhibitory activity.37,43 The elevated inhibition byWproteinmight be because of its nuclear localization ability.41,47 This allows it to suppress expression of IFN α/β and antiviral gene at gene expression level\nand confirms lower probability of eliciting antiviral activity, than as happens in case of cytoplasmic inhibition by V proteins.37,44,45\nThe cytoplasmic inhibitory activity of V proteins is achieved by its binding with dsRNA responding RLR receptor MAD5 hence down regulating the activation of TBK1 and IKKε which activates IFN α/β gene transcription factor IRF3 and IRF7 (Figure 3, D.1). This suppression of IFN β gene expression can be overcome by another TLR3 mediated alternative pathway by producing more amount of adaptor protein IRF1 which activates TBK1 (Figure 3, B.1).37\nFurther, attenuation of IFNs responded antiviral activity of an infected cell can be discussed considering the JACK/STAT signaling pathway necessary for transcriptional level activation of antiviral genes.37,46,47 Responding to IFN α/β and γ, the interactions between phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 form their hetero or homodimer (by STAT1 only) respectively (Figure 3, D.2). These dimmers are precursor molecule of IFN α/β gene transcription factor.48,49 Hence inhibitions of STAT1 and STAT2 interaction result in the absence of antiviral activity. Protein P, V andW interact with STAT1with their amino terminal domain while only protein V can interact with STAT2.37 Re-localization of non-phosphorylated STAT1 from its typically cytoplasmic location by protein W also makes its unavailability for STAT dimer formation and hence inhibition of IFN α/β gene transcription factor formation (Figure 3, D.3).37 The viral C protein which is predominantly localized in cytoplasm and partly in nucleus is responsible for enveloped viral budding and release by recruiting host ESCRT pathway.50,51 The C terminal domain of NiV-C, as it possesses homology in its sequence with host protein Vps28 could interact directly with TSG 101, an adaptor molecule between ESCRT I and\nESCRT II. However, the reciprocal action amongESCRT I–NiVC and ESCRT II is not fully understood.50 But it has been speculated that viral C protein interacts with M protein present in the inner leaflet of plasma membrane and thereby direct vectorial release of virus particles (Figure 3, B.2).50,52"

      "text" : "Guillaume et al developed a potent Vaccinia virus (VV) mediated VV-NiV-F and VV-NiV-G recombinant vaccines in a hamster model.53 They found immunized organism shows complete immunity against NiV induced fatal encephalitis by producing neutralizing antibodies whereas it occurs within 7 to 10 days after intraperitoneal inoculation of NiV isolates. The low neutralizing ability of the produced antibodies as confirmed by the increasing level of serum antibodies gives an idea of studying effect of passive immunization against NiV. Intraperitoneal injection of polyclonal as well as monoclonal (mAb) anti-F and anti-G, separately shows that anti-F and anti-G mAb are more efficient in neutralizing NiV viral infection as compared to polyclonal Ab, with anti-F mAb having high degree of antiviral activity than anti-G mAb.54 A recent hit on broad-spectrum small molecule antiviral purine analogue previously mentioned Favipiravir (T-705) which inhibits NIV and HeV replication in vitro with a minimal cytotoxic effect of highest concentration tested, having a CC50 value of N1000 μl (as observed in Hamster model) has provided a way to fight against the cytopathic effect of deadly NiV, HeV like paramyxoviruses.6\nIt is not late when one day due to the consistent change in their genome these pathogens would get resistance to the conventional drugs which are unidirectional and have no specific targeted. These limitations could be ameliorated by finding a novel therapy with multiple pathways and biomarkers for the target oriented action. For example in NiV depletion of NiV-C recruited ESCRT pathway mechanism and deposition of other viral proteins (N, M, F, G and L) results in cytoplasmic budding and impaired release of virus from the infected cell.50,51 There are numerous intermediate molecules associated with ESCRT pathway; targeting conserved intermediate molecules or their precursor might be a novel strategy to eliminate the virus. Further the ligands or receptors with a binding efficiency with viral intermediate molecules could be further enhanced by their amalgamation with nanotechnology.1"

Therefore to understand the antiviral activity of NPs a general overview about different types and forms of NPs/ nano-based systems is a necessity. Nano-based antiviral agents extend from simple inorganic NPs to complex organic and hybrid nanosystems. Metallic NPs (MNPs) and NCs in the form of nanospheres, nanocapsule and nanocage could be categorized under inorganic NPs (INPs). Organic NPs (ONPs) include nanocapsule as in the form of NCs, primarily differentiated based on chemical composition.

In Peste des petits ruminants' virus the NPs act by interacting with virion surface and core protein, impairing viral replication and entry.59,60\nLikewise in dsRNA viruses the AgNPs after interaction with viral genome, the NPs were found to inhibit viral replication.61 The antiviral efficacies of AgNPs by these modes of viral entry or attachment inhibition or viral replication inhibition have also been evaluated in other viruses shown in Table 1."

Norouzi et al developed a cadmium–tellurium QD in association with a biotin acceptor and NH2-receptor probes with target DNA for recognition of human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) in vitro.97 Likewise, there are many other evaluations where QDs have been utilized either as therapeutics or for in vitro diagnosis of viral pathogens."

Since, sustained release kinetics can directly influence therapeutic competence and toxicity of the nanosystem.98 Multiple forms of ONPs are exploited in field of nanomedicine but only certain specific ONPs are presently being evaluated for their antiviral activity.

Various forms of polymers (synthetic and natural) have immensely contributed towards meticulous understanding of definite properties such as biodistribution/ bioavailability, biocompatibility, immunocompatibility etc. in biomedical sector. But their uses either for development or for improvement of an antiviral have been investigated only for some pathogenic viruses like influenza, HIV and rabies virus (Table 2).100–102 Their efficient self-assembly properties, nanosize, shape, and ability to be functionalized based on requirement to either carry the desired therapeutic agent in its core or conjugate the target molecule on its surface are simply magnificent. Recently, Joshy et al have demonstrated that amine functionalized polymeric gelatin NPs loaded with zidovudine against HIV. Simultaneously, they have also conducted hemolysis and aggregation studies to gain deeper understanding of other compatible properties of NPs. From their research they summarized that drug conjugatedNPs showed promising biocompatibility and antiviral activity.103 Deng et al on the other hand took a different approach by developing a universal influenza vaccine with double-layered protein NPs composed of tetramaric Matrix protein 2 (M2e) at its core and headless Hemagglutinin (HA) coating at its surface. The protein vaccine could induce substantial and prolonged immunity with complete protection of BALB/c mice against verity influenza A virus challenges.104 With the contemporary improvement made in nanoscience it is certain that these impeccable polymeric NPs in near future will be soon used for the development of a novel antiviral against divergent array of infectious viruses like NiV."

      "heading" : "Hybrid nanoparticles",
      "text" : "Hybrid NPs are by far the most advanced form of NPs that could be thought of in the present century. INPs such as Ag, Au, magnetic NPs, TiO2, SiO2, CNT, fullerene and graphene oxide and ONPs such as polymeric NPs, lipid NPs and niosomes have been explored in their antiviral activity.123–125 There are a number of viruses against which these NPs in their hybridized state have been evaluated; these include HIV, influenza virus, hepatitis virus, human adenovirus etc. (Table 3).\nHybridized NPs in virology may be categorized according to their utilization that is either diagnostic or therapy. Current investigations, where efforts have been made towards diagnosis or detection of the viruses have been documented by many investigators from different corners of the globe. Starting from the primary application that is detection, Marjomäki et al earlier had reported an accurate and precise enteroviruses labeling procedure and described it at the atomic level. Here they reported water-soluble thiol-stabilized gold cluster or chemically called Au102 (para-mercaptobenzoic acid)44 cluster which by its metal core could covalently bind to cysteine molecule nearer to the surface of the virus. Through the above procedure enteroviruses echovirus 1 and coxsackievirus B3 viruses were precisely detected.126 Ahmed et al have synthesized a multifunctional nanohybrid where AuNPs are first bonded with CNT surface, and then specific antibody (anti-influenza A virus HA H1 antibody) is conjugated to it. The nanohybrid displayed oxidative catalysis of 3, 3′, 5, 5′-tetramethyl-benzidine (TMB) by H2O2 gave rise to a deep blue color, the optical density of which depended on concentration of virus.127 Lately, Oh et al developed an ultrasensitive magnetic nanozyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of H1N1 virus. The assay had two major components, the silica-shelled magnetic nanobeads (MagNBs) for binding and preliminary detection of the virus, and a gold nanozyme (AuNZ) an enzymelike acting molecule for amplification of the preliminary detection signals. Together in combination the nanosystem could even detect virus concentration up to femtogram per milliliter.128 There are a\n213R.G. Kerry et al / Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology, and Medicine 18 (2019) 196–220\nnumber of examples where hybridized nano-based systems showed promising results in viral detection; some of them have been listed in Table 3.\nViral inhibition is foremost important after diagnosis which needs to be addressed immediately; thereafter the requirement of a novel antiviral to combat the viral infectivity has become the primary concern. Further, development of an antiviral within a stipulated time is actually a race against time. Under such case formulation of an antiviral that is biocompatible, nonimmunogenic and non-toxic is of the critical requirement to which hybridized nanoparticulated systems are an appreciable option. It is because of the promising antiviral activity of these systems that has been portrayed by various scientific investigators. Ryoo et al had reported iron-oxide NP-based delivery of DNAzyme as a therapeutic for treating hepatitis C infection. Here, the magnetic NPs were linked to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) and functional DNAzyme which could induce knockdown of HVC gene NS3 (non-structural protein 3) encoding viral helicase and protease.129 Orlowski et al developed tannic acid functionalized AgNPs of specific size range that could reduce HSV-2 infectivity by blocking viral attachment, penetration as well as viral spread; provided a prior direct attachment of the nano-system with the virus is a basic requirement.130 Chen et al compared the antiviral activity of both graphene oxide (GO) and GO conjugated AdNPs against both coronavirus (FCoV) and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Their analyses showed GO in its non-conjugated and conjugated form had different effect on two different taken viruses. Overall they concluded that GO in its conjugated form that is GO-AgNPs could inhibit both the virus that is FCoV and IBDV effectively.131 After diagnosis and therapy the next arising huddle is drug resistance that soon must be focused and acted accordingly. With this intention Li et al, after much evaluations and strategic understanding the drawbacks of conventional and nano-based antiviral, designed nanoparticulated system by decorating amantadine (AM) on surface of selenium NPs (SeNPs). Their designed Se-AM nanosystem could reverse the drug resistance induced by H1N1 virus.132 Similarly, there are many other investigations which orchestrate the experimental efficiencies of hybrid nanoparticulated systems as antivirals listed in Table 3. Despite the heterogeneous research and investigations exploiting multiple ways and means to diagnose, inhibit the virus by a nano-based therapeutic agent or reverse the drug resistance, still there is hardly any sign of these applications concerning NiV.\nPossible nano-based approach for NiV diagnosis\nThe elevated cost and in some case toxicity of conventionally available specific antiviral therapeutics have created an apparent requirement for specific and rapid viral diagnosis. Specific viral diagnosis may be helpful in discontinuation of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy and determination of prognosis, and it is also believed that rapid test result greatly influences case management. Prior to therapy, diagnosis therefore may be considered as an important aspect in viral infection treatment. There are multiple methods in the present era for laboratory based\ndiagnosis of viral infection; these include serology, viral culture, antigen and nucleic acid detection.\nThe conventional technique of viral detection that is viral culture may be considered as the only technique through which viable isolate could be obtained for future characterization. Additionally, detection of a diverse array of viruses seems promising with this approach, which is also an advantage over antigen detection and nucleic acid detection. In order to preserve medically relevant viruses, maintenance of heterogeneous types of cultured cell is required as a support, which is a major limitation of this technique. Viral recovery through cell culture becomes difficult when the viral growth is slow; antigen detection in such cases is much useful. Rapidity and non-requirement of viral viability render immense plasticity in management and shifting of the specimens, which together may be considered as the major advantages of the technique. Fluorescent Antibody (FA) staining, Immunoperoxidase staining and Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) etc. are crucial techniques involved in these methods. But viruses with antigenic heterogeneity and lack of cross-reacting antigens are tedious to be detected even through this technique. Drastic transformation in diagnosis has emerged with the development of analysis based on PCR. This transformation has allowed the detection of specific viral sequence with uttermost sensitivity. More specifically, viral RNA could be easily detected only by amalgamating reverse transcriptase with conventional PCR analysis. Real-Time PCR assay runs on highly sophisticated automated instruments; exploiting optical excitation systems and dyes labeled with fluorescent molecules has tremendously reduced time and probable contamination. The versatility of nucleic acid detection is growing day-by-day and will be in future with the progression of scientific innovation. Finally, the efficacy serology the traditional method viral diagnosis cannot be disregarded. The technique is exclusively promising for unambiguous antiviral immunity determination, but when speculated on clinical utility, assessment of acute and convalescent antibody titers, could be one of its limitations.133 In case of NiV detection these mentioned detection techniques may be fruitful.\nUpon considering the present encroachment in the field of nanoscience and virology, their intermediated research has initiated a new direction in rapid diagnosis of infectious viruses. Like Au/CuS core/shell NPs developed by Broglie et al for human norovirus-like particle detection and inactivation by capsid protein degradation and damage,124 similarly a hybrid nanosystem could also be designed for binding with NiV virion two spiked glycoproteins F and G as well as RNA, and capsid proteins such as N, P, L contained within the virion (Figure 4).21\nA colorimetric viral detection assay exploiting peroxidase-like activity of AuNPs-CNT nanohybrid could also be developed for detection of NiV detection like Ahmed et al, who synthesized and examined the same nanohybrid for the detection of H3N2.127 Likewise there are a number of versatile experimentation (Tables 1, 2, and 3) where diagnoses of a verity of viral infections have been summarized. Contemplating on these possibilities, the probabilities of developing a novel nanobased diagnosis technique for detecting NiV could be achieved.\nPossible nano-based approach for NiV inhibition\nIf NiV detection could be possible, then elimination of the virus through nano-based system is not far or out of reach from the present investigators. The conventional means of viral inhibition or treatment / therapy have been documented under the topic “Therapeutics against NiV”. The nano-based approaches like the use of acid functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCTs) made of photoactivated molecules (Protoporphyrin IX) to inactivate H3N2 virus have been demonstrated by Banerjee et al.87 The possible molecular mechanism involved is ROS-based inactivation throughwhich oxidation of viral protein (neuraminidase [NA] and hemagglutinin [HA]) might have taken place; single stranded break in viral genome and protein-RNA crosslinking might have also been a possibility. Similar nano-based approach including pH or photothermal medium accompanied with ROSbased inactivation of NiV could also be evaluated in vitro. Inhibition of viral binding with the host cell surface receptor could also be achieved by preventing viral binding of gp120 and CD4 attachment. In a study, Vijayakumar and Ganesan have demon-\nstrated this mode of inhibition of HIV-1 virus entry using AuNPs in vitro.62 Similarly, NPs with the capacity to interact with NiV surface glycoproteins like G and F could prove to be promising candidates as viral entry inhibitors. Inhibition of virus mediated accumulation of ROS, activation of AKT, and p53 phosphorylation could also be a strategy for inhibiting the entry of infectious viruses. Li et al demonstrated this strategy of H1N1 viral inhibition using oseltamivir (OTV) decorated SeNPs (Se@OTV).134 This strategy could be effectively evaluated in vitro in case of NiV inhibition. Likewise modulation of viral transcription using MWCTs- ribavirin byZhu et al,135 targeted binding on conservative regions on viral genome using TiO2NPs and polylysine (PL)containing oligonucleotides nanocomposite by Levina et al.136 and silencing viral replication with the help of solid lipid NPs by Torrecilla et al137 etc. all point in the same direction (Tables 1, 2, and 3). Though the efficiency of NPs as an antiviral agent against NiV is yet to be evaluated; still it could be roughly speculated that these investigations are direct representation of the possibility that NPs holds an enormous potential as an antiviral agent against NiV described in Figure 4.\n215R.G.

Though it is possible that nano-based approaches are the next convenient strategy to deal with NiV, but still developing NPs is difficult if the NiV pathogenesis is not properly understood. Therefore the present review provides a brief knowledge about NiV pathogenesis at cellular and molecular level, where it would be easy to strategize a novel antiviral target using NPs. A brief introduction of various NPs in inorganic, organic and hybrid forms would be helpful in determining their suitability to be evaluated as diagnostics or therapeutics. Finally the overview of major antiviral approaches that have already been studied is represented in tabular format, which could help to strategize possible novel antiviral approach."

    "abstractText" : "Emergence of new virus and their heterogeneity are growing at an alarming rate. Sudden outburst of Nipah virus (NiV) has raised serious question about their instant management using conventional medication and diagnostic measures. A coherent strategy with versatility and comprehensive perspective to confront the rising distress could perhaps be effectuated by implementation of nanotechnology. But in concurrent to resourceful and precise execution of nano-based medication, there is an ultimate need of concrete understanding of the NIV pathogenesis. Moreover, to amplify the effectiveness of nano-based approach in a conquest against NiV, a list of developed nanosystem with antiviral activity is also a prerequisite. Therefore the present review provides a meticulous cognizance of cellular and molecular pathogenesis of NiV. Conventional as well several nano-based diagnosis experimentations against viruses have been discussed. Lastly, potential efficacy of different forms of nano-based systems as convenient means to shield mankind against NiV has also been introduced. © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
