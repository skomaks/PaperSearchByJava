It was rationally designed and successfully synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal route. The crystal phase, defects, element composition and morphology of the obtained samples were characterized in detail by XRD, FESEM, TEM, Raman, PL, and XPS. The characterized results reveal that hierarchical SnO/SnO2 nano-flowers are assembled from ultrathin nanosheets with about 9–11 nm in thickness. Gas sensing performance shows that the sensor based on SnO/SnO2 nano-flowers has crucial advantages for formaldehyde detection, such as low operating temperature (120 °C), excellent selectivity, short response time (7 s), high response value (80.9) and low detection limitation (8.15 ppb). The excellent gas responses of the sensor can be attributed to its unique hierarchical microstructure (for decrease of Rg and increase of Ra) and p-n junction between SnO and SnO2 (for increase of Ra). Finally, the sensing mechanism of the prepared was proposed in detail."

      "text" : "With the rapid development of human life and industrial manufacture, people pay more attention to issues such as environmental pollution, health and safety [1]. Formaldehyde, one of the carcinogenic gases, can damage people’s health seriously and need precise detection to make sure whether its concentration is down to 0.08 ppm [2]. Up to now, several researchers have made unremitting efforts to develop sensors with excellent formaldehyde performance [3,4]. Objectively speaking, there are still need deeper explore to exploit the high sensitivity and reproducibility gas sensor worked at low temperature. On the one hand, the equipment with high operating temperature provides an unsafe atmosphere for flammable and explosive gases. On the other hand, low operating temperature will benefit for facile integration in portable devices with minimum probability of explosion [5].\nMetal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors have been widely used for gas detection because of their advantages including easily obtained, convenience in carrying, fast and high gas response [6]. Nowadays, ZnO [7–10], SnO2 [11,12], In2O3 [13,14], Co3O4 [15] and WO3 [16] have been employed to construct gas sensors. Among them, SnO2 is the most widely used and studied gas sensing materials at present [17]. It is well known that the sensing mechanism for MOS gas\nsensors is based on the theory of space charge layer [18,19], which means that the sensing responses of SnO2 depend on the adsorption properties and redox reaction between the detected gas and the chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of sensing materials. Therefore, morphology and composition of sensing materials both have profound impacts on the gas response [20], attracting a great interest among researchers.\nRecently, researchers have conducted several studies to improve the response characteristics of SnO2 based gas sensors. One work is to tune gas sensing properties by using SnO2 materials with different low dimensions, which jointly promote the rapid development of SnO2 gas sensors. But there are some potential drawbacks that cannot be ignored, such as easy agglomeration and instability of materials under high temperature. Such disadvantages limit the wide application of SnO2 based gas sensors. So the researchers turned their attention to three dimension (3D) nano-materials self-assembled from low dimensional materials [21–23]. 3D materials not only have the advantages of low dimensional materials, but also have high stability and large efficient surface area, making them a potential way to optimize gas detection. Similarly, some researchers employ noble metals (Au [24], Pd [25], Pt [26] and Rh [27]) to improve the gas response of SnO2 based gas sensors, especially in gas selectivity. The enhanced gas response is\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2019.04.061 Received 18 January 2019; Received in revised form 7 April 2019; Accepted 9 April 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author.

To a certain degree, this method increases the cost of sensor fabrication due to the use of noble metals. What’s more, the loading or doping of other metal oxides in the SnO2 material can also improve the gas sensing properties [28–31]. Another method to enhance the gas response is to form hetero-junction between the interfaces of two different materials. Many experiments have proved that this method to improve gas response and selectivity is effective and inexpensive, so it is worthy of deep research.\nIn the present study, the two-phase composite of SnO/SnO2 with a nano-flower shaped hierarchical structure was synthesized by one-pot hydrothermal method. Gas sensing test results show that SnO/SnO2 nano-flowers based gas sensor behaves excellent sensing performance. At the optimal operating temperature of 120 °C, the gas response (Ra/ Rg) of SnO/SnO2 nano-flowers gas sensor to 50 ppm formaldehyde can reach 80.9 with a detection limit of 8.15 ppb. The reasons for improvement in gas sensing were investigated in relation to suitable morphology and composition of sensing materials as well as existence of p-n junction. It is believed that the as synthesized SnO/SnO2 nanoflowers material holds great potential as a highly effective and low power consumed gas sensor."

The specific surface area was estimated by using the BrunauerEmmett-Teller (BET) equation based on the nitrogen adsorption isotherm (77 K) by a 3H-2000III surface area analyzer (Beishide Instrument Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd.). The XPS data were collected on a WSCLAB X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy system (XPS) at room temperatures from Thermo Fisher Scientific, England.

      "text" : "As shown in Fig. S1(a), the gas sensor was made from Al2O3 tube, Au electrode, Pt wire, heating wire and oxides coating. According to our previous work on fabricating gas sensor [32], the synthesis materials\nwere mixed with water separately to form uniform pastes by constantly grinding. Subsequently, those pastes were coated on the Al2O3 tube. Then tubes were dried at 100 °C for 6 h to remove the water. Finally, the Ni-Cr heating wires were inserted into the tubes as a heater for adjusting the operating temperature of the gas sensors. And the gas sensors were aged at 120 °C for 5 days to improve its stability.\nThe gas sensing properties of as synthesized materials were measured by a traditional WS-30 A gas sensing measurement system (Zhengzhou Weisheng Electron. Technol. Co., Ltd.) under the air humidity of about 40% and the room temperature of about 30 °C. And we adopted static gas distribution to evaluate sensing performance of the sensors. Before the gas or liquid injection, a steady state resistance in air needs to be obtained, and named as Ra. Then a certain amount of detected gas or liquid was injected into the test chamber or onto an evaporator, and mixed with air directly, the resistance in the detected gas changed rapidly and reached a steady value called as Rg.\nThe test circuit diagram of gas sensor was shown in Fig. S1(b). It can be seen that the circuit was consist of a DC power, a load resistance (RL) and a gas sensor. In the diagram, VC is the voltage of circuit, Vh is the heating voltage, and Vout is the output voltage on loading resistance RL. We can calculate the Ra and Rg by measuring the output voltage (Vout) before and after introduction of the detected gas. In this article, the gas response value is defined as Ra/Rg (reducing gas) or Rg/Ra (oxidizing gas). The response time (τres) is expressed as the time reached 90% of the stable resistance in detected gas. And the recovery time (τrecov) is the time decreased 90% gas response after leaving the detected gas to air."

      "text" : "The XRD pattern of M2, M4 and M6 samples was shown in Fig. 1(a). It is found that three samples all exhibit strong diffraction peaks, revealing that good crystallinity; and show the precursors molar ratio dependent components. When the molar ratio of SnCl2·2H2O to Na3C6H5O7·2H2O is 2:10 and 4:10, respectively, the two samples of M2 and M4 were consist of tetragonal rutile SnO2 [33] (JCPDS card no. 41- 1445) and little tetragonal SnO [34] (JCPDS card no. 72-2324) marked with an asterisk. Increasing the molar ratio up to 6:10, all the peaks of M6 sample are indexed to the tetragonal rutile SnO2, indicating its high purity. In addition, we label the standard peaks of the exposed crystal faces of SnO2 and SnO in M2, M4 and M6. The XRD pattern of M4-300 and M4 samples is demonstrated in Fig. S2. It can be concluded that M4 converted to single phase SnO2 (M4-300) after it was calcined at 300 °C. Compared with M4-300, the M4 behaves both higher peak intensity and narrower half band width, indicating that M4 has better crystallinity compared with single phase SnO2 (M4-300).\nThe general morphology of samples was examined by a field emission electron microscope, the results were shown in the Fig. 1(b–d). As we can see, the M2 sample presents an uneven spheroidal structure consisted of nanosheets and nanoparticles. The M4 sample shows a homogeneous hierarchical flower-like structure about 800 nm and assembled from nanosheets about 9–11 nm in thickness. The M6 sample displays an irregular block structure with few nanosheets. The morphology of M4-300 sample obtained after high temperature calcination is shown in Fig. S3. Its hierarchical structure is not obvious, and the crystallinity is lower than that of M4 in Fig. 1(c). This phenomenon can well corresponds to the XRD pattern in Fig. S2.\nRaman spectroscopy is an effective way to analyze the crystalline structures, crystal phases and defects related to oxygen vacancies of nanomaterial [35]. Fig. S4 exhibits Raman spectra of three samples at room temperature. The M2 and M4 samples have a small peak at 208 cm−1, which can be attributed to the active mode of SnO [36]. And the peak located at 630 cm−1 can be assigned to the fundamental Raman active vibrational modes, A1g of SnO2 [37], meaning the expansion of\nthe Sn-O stretching vibration mode, which can well proves the presence of SnO2 in the samples. It can also be known that the three samples all have a relatively broad peak near 570 cm−1 marked with an ellipse. It is resulted from defects in the SnO2 surface [38]. From the inset in Fig. S4, the A1g band at 630 cm-1 becomes wider and moves toward a lower wave number as the ratio of the precursor increases. It maybe due to phonon confinement in nanostructured materials, which leads to spectral broadening and shifting of Raman modes. In other words, the smaller the average grain size of the material will shift the A1g peak to the left in the Raman spectrum [39].\nThe detailed microstructural and crystallographic properties of M4 were studied by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) with SAED. Fig. 2(a) and (b) reveals that M4 sample is hierarchical structure including nanosheets. The assembly of the nanosheets shows dense to sparse from the inside to the outside. The HRTEM image exhibits the well-defined lattice fringes with the interplanar spacings of 0.33 nm, 0.26 nm and 0.18 nm, corresponding to the (110) and (101) lattice planes of SnO2 and (020) lattice plane of SnO (Fig. 2(c)) [40], respectively. The overall crystallinity of the M4 is manifested by the SAED and displayed in Fig. 2(d). It indicats that the flower-like M4 sample is polycrystalline structure, and the diffraction rings can be well indexed to SnO2 and SnO [41].\nThe specific surface area and corresponding BJH pore size distribution of the three samples are extracted by measuring nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. As shown in Fig. S5(a–c), obvious hysteresis loops indicating the existence of porous structures. The specific surface areas calculated of M2, M4 and M6 are 25.33m2 g−1, 28.10m2 g−1 and 25.50m2 g−1, respectively. The insets in Fig. S5(a–c) are the BJH pore size distribution plots. It is found that M2 sample has the pore size distribution from mesopores or macropores. Whereas, pore sizes of M4 and M6 samples located mainly within mesopores, accompanying a little macropores come from the stacking of nanosheets. In the process of gas sensing, mesopores are more conducive to adsorb gases to enhance the gas response; while macropores benefit for gas diffusion, futher shorten recovery time [42,43].\nAs shown in Fig. 3, the chemical states and elemental compositions of the three samples were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Fig. 3(a–c) shows the Sn 3d high resolution spectra of the three samples. It is reported that the main peaks of Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/ 2 for SnO2 are located at 486.60 eV and 495.00 eV, and the peaks at\n485.60 eV and 494.00 eV are attributed to SnO [44]. Therefore, M2 and M4 are two-phase SnO/SnO2, and M6 is single phase SnO2, which is consistent with the conclusions previously stated. The high-resolution O1 s of the three samples with three peaks illustrated in Fig. 3(d–f) were shown around 530.4 eV, 531.8 eV and 533.3 eV. Among them, the peak at 530.4 eV is ascribed to inner lattice oxygen [45], which named OⅠ. While the peak at 531.8 of OⅡ belongs to the surfaced-adsorbed oxygen species O−, O2−,O2- [46]. A characteristic peak of OⅢ located at 533.3 eV can be judged as Sn-OH on the surface of the material [47].\nPL emission spectroscopy is widely used to study charge carrier trapping, migration and transfer, and to understand the recombination of photoelectron/hole pairs in semiconductors. Fig. 4 demonstrates the PL spectra of the three samples at an excitation wavelength of 300 nm and deconvolutions by Gaussian distribution. The peaks (˜366 nm) around UV light can be ascribed to the recombination of electron/hole in the conduction band and valence band [48], and high PL emission intensity means the photo-generated electron/hole pairs in materials easily recombine each other, so it can be concluded that there is a quickly recombination for photo-generated electron/hole in the M6 sample [49]. The peaks at ˜418 nm [50], ˜438 nm [51] and ˜451 nm [52] are assigned to band edge free excitons. The peaks from 468 nm to 600 nm are usually attributed to oxygen vacancies (Vo) in the samples [53]. Defect percentages of the three samples are summarized in Table 1, which shows that the Vo is the main defects of three samples, and M4 sample has more Vo than other two. Because of Vo can increase the gas sensing performance, the presence of a large number of Vo can improve the adsorption of oxygen and enhance the interaction between adsorbed oxygen and tested gas [54]."

      "text" : "It is well known that operating temperature has crucial effect on sensing properties of gas sensor, such as resistance Ra, reactive activity with tested gases and response dynamics [55]. Fig. 5 shows the responses of M2, M4, M6 and M4-300 gas sensors to 50 ppm formaldehyde under different temperatures. M2 and M4 gas sensors have same change trend in gas response, both present a volcanic type curve in gas response via operating temperature, caused by the equilibrium between a resistance drop induced by rising temperature and a resistance rise resulting from chemisorption of oxygen molecules. The\nmaximum of gas response appears at 120 °C, which was selected as the optimal operating temperature of M2 and M4 sensors for further test. For M6 and M4-300 gas sensors, the largest gas response arises at 200 °C, it is larger than that of M2 and M4 sensors, so 200 °C was chosen as their optimal operating temperature.\nContinuous detecting response for a sensor is necessary to evaluate its reproducibility, linearity and stability. Fig. 6(a) is the response curve of the gas sensors for low concentration (1–10 ppm) formaldehyde; and Fig. 6(c) is that for higher concentration (10–50 ppm) formaldehyde. The entire test process includes five breathing pulses. It is found that the M4 gas sensor has excellent sensing performance at both low and high formaldehyde concentrations compared with the other three sensors. These tests also demonstrate that above sensing materials present good reproducibility. The continuous incremental response from 10 ppm to 40 ppm formaldehyde is shown in Fig. 6(b). Four sensors all have strong response to formaldehyde and behave continuously increasing response with the increase of gas concentration to be tested.\nFig. 6(d) shows linear fitting curve of gas concentration and response for the four sensors. The coefficients of determination (r2) for the four sensors are all close to 1.0, indicating the high linearity. But those satisfactory fitting lines restrict the formaldehyde detection only at low concentrations. Once the concentration is too high, the surface coverage of the sensing material tends to saturate, further leads to a saturated response. By comparing the four curves, the slope of the M4 gas sensor is larger than that of the other sensors, which indirectly proves that M4 is a more sensitive material for formaldehyde detection. The standard deviation of M4 is S= 0.003719, the slope R` of the straight line is 1.368. According to the formula: L= 3*S/R`, the calculated limit of detection is 8.15 ppb.\nFig. 7(a) reveals the Ra values of four sensors at different temperature. It is worth noting that the Ra values of M2 and M4 sensors are always greater than that of M6 and M4-300 at the same temperature. These data combined with XRD results (Fig. 1(a) and Fig. S2) demonstrate that p-n junctions in M2 and M4 materials maybe existed. When the operating temperature rise, the Ra values of four gas sensors gradually drop to steady values above 100 °C. The results are consistent with the nature of the n-type semiconductors.\nIn addition, the response and recovery characteristics are both important parameters in application of gas sensors. Thus, the response and recovery times of four sensors toward 50 ppm formaldehyde were\nTable 1 The deconvolutions by Gaussian distribution of M2, M4 and M6 samples.\nOrigination Peak (nm) M2 (%) M4 (%) M6 (%)\n(CB-VB) combination of SnO2 ˜366 13.21 7.31 17.70 Band edge free excitons ˜418, ˜438, ˜451 29.20 28.36 26.56 Vo ˜468 to 600 57.59 64.33 55.74\nFig. 5. Relationship between the response and the optimal operating temperature of the sensors to 50 ppm formaldehyde.\ninvestigated at their optimal operating temperature. According to Fig. 7(b), the response time (τres) and recovery time (τrecov) of the M4 gas sensor is 7 s and 27 s, respectively, which is much shorter than that of the M2. The quick response of the M4 sensor may be attributed to the special morphology assembled from ultrathin nanosheets, which can offer sufficient active surface and good permeability for the fast gas adsorption and desorption. At 200 °C, the response and recovery time of M6 gas sensor are 8 s and 4 s, respectively, whereas those of M4-300 are 18 s and 33 s, respectively. Although M6 has a shorter recovery time, it is weaker than M4 in terms of improving operating temperature and response.\nIt is known that gas response of sensors changes with operating temperatures due to their unlike chemical activity. The front studies indicate that the optimal operating temperatures of M2, M4, M6 and M4-300 are 120 °C, 120 °C, 200 °C and 200 °C, respectively. At those temperatures, how do they response to other gases? Fig. 8(a–d) exhibit the responses of four gas sensors to some kinds of 50 ppm gases at their optimal operating temperatures. From these figures, the four gas sensors all have good selectivity for formaldehyde because the response values for the other gases are very low. In particular, the M4 gas sensor has the best selectivity to formaldehyde, and its response value to 50 ppm formaldehyde can reach 80.9.\nExcellent repeatability of M4 gas sensor was shown in Fig. S6(a), which behaves 5 complete cycles with good repeatability and neglectable changes. To inspect the long-term stability, the M4 gas sensor was tested persistently for 30 days under 50 ppm formaldehyde gas at the operating temperature of 120 °C. As shown in Fig. S6(b), the response values are just floating around 80 without dramatic performance degradation. In addition, the thermal stability of the M4 was tested from 25 °C to 400 °C under air atmosphere. As shown in Fig. S7, the thermogravimetric curve undergoes three obvious processes with the increase of heating temperature. The first weight loss (∼3.4%) starts at 25 °C until 170 °C, corresponding to the removal of adsorbed water. The second weight loss (∼3.8%) occurs in the temperature range of 170 °C to 260 °C, attributing to the cleavage, fragmentation and degradation of residual citrate and/or hydroxyl groups bound from the surface of the synthetic product. The third stage from 260 to 313 °C produces a slight mass increase caused by the addition of oxygen, implying that the twophase SnO/SnO2 are converted into stable SnO2. The above results demonstrate that the M4 material has good thermal stability at the optimum operating temperature 120 °C.\nFig. S8 displays the relationship between formaldehyde response and different humidity from 40% RH to 80% RH for M4 gas sensor at its optimum operating temperature 120 °C. The values of M4 gas sensor to 50 ppm formaldehyde are slightly decrease as the humidity increase. This phenomenon can be attributed to the presence of water vapor, which would blocks the adsorption of oxygen and formaldehyde gas and reduces active position during sensing process [56]. In addition, the dynamic gas measurement of M4 gas sensor to 50 ppm formaldehyde at 120 °C was shown in Fig. S9, it can be found that the response in dynamic gas measurement is higher than that in static gas measurement.\nTable 2 makes a summary for previous SnO2 based formaldehyde gas sensors. Firstly, except that the operating temperature 25 °C of the Au@SnO2 gas sensor is lower than this work [24], the operating temperature of other gas sensors is equal to or higher than this work\n[56–59]. But the gas response and detection limit of the Au@SnO2 gas sensor at 25 °C are too poor. Secondly, at the same operating temperature of 120 °C, the response and recovery characteristics of M4 gas sensor (7 s and 27 s) are the best than the previous works. Moreover, the detection limit of the M4 gas sensor is as low as 8.15 ppb. Thirdly, at the optimal operating temperature of previous works, the response value of M4 gas sensor is higher than other SnO2-based gas sensors. Overall, compared with the results reported in the literatures, the M4 flower-like material synthesized in this work will becomes a promising formaldehyde sensing material"

      "text" : "Based on the above characterizations and gas sensing results, the sensitization mechanism of the M4 gas sensor should be understood more clearly. In this paper, the sensing materials with different morphologies and compositions were synthesized by controlling the ratio of precursors. Literatures proved that morphologies of the sensing materials have important effect on their gas responses [60]. Therefore, one of the reasons for enhanced gas response of M4 should belong to its unique hierarchical nano-flower structure assembled from the nanosheets. For M4, the average thickness of ultrathin nanosheets is about 9–11 nm. Such thin nanosheets can accelerate the electron transport during sensing process, making response quickly [61]. For surface resistance controlled MOS gas sensor, bigger specific surface area generates higher gas response because it can provides more adsorptive and reactive sites for oxygen and detecting gas, following by Ra rise up and Rg drop down, then enhances gas response Ra/Rg. Among the four samples, M4 has the highest response due to its biggest specific surface area. In addition, the amount of oxygen vacancies including the sensing materials is also closely related to their gas response. The relative ratios of vacancy defect in three samples calculated from the PL spectra (Fig. 4) are 57.59%, 64.33% and 55.74%, respectively. Because oxygen\nvacancy defect is an active center for adsorption of oxygen, more oxygen vacancy defects can adsorb more oxygen molecules to form thicker electron depletion layer, resulting in the increase of Ra; and also enhance the redox reaction between adsorbed oxygen and detected gas, leading to the decrease of Rg, so the biggest oxygen vacancy concentration is responsible for the highest response of M4 gas sensor.\nBased on the fact that SnO to be oxidized to SnO2 not completely, we guess a little p-type SnO may be contacts with n-type SnO2 each other to form p-n junction, and further increase the Ra and decrease Rg of M4 sensing material, it is the fourth reason for enhancing gas response to formaldehyde [62–64]. In Fig. 9(a), as a p-type semiconductor, SnO has narrow band gap energy of 0.7 eV, and SnO2 is a ntype semiconductor with wide band gap energy of 3.6 eV. So there would build the p-n junction near the interface between the p-SnO and n-SnO2. As presented in Fig. 9(b), in the area of a p-n junction, electrons will flow from the n-SnO2 to the p-SnO, and the holes in the p-SnO will also flow into the n-SnO2, resulting in the concentration of main carrier drop of the sensing material. Finally, an interface depletion layer is formed within the contact area of p-SnO and n-SnO2. As illustrated in Fig. 9(c), oxygen molecules will adsorb on the surface of n-SnO2 to form chemisorbed oxygen (O2−, O−, O2-) by capturing the electrons from the conduction band of n-SnO2, and form an electron depletion layer. When p-SnO is connected with n-SnO2, the n-SnO2 will form a thicker electron depletion layer due to the p-n junction, leading to a higher resistance Ra than pure n-SnO2. As shown in Fig. 9(d), when the M4 sensing material is exposed to formaldehyde, chemisorbed oxygen would undergo redox\nreaction with formaldehyde and release the electrons to M4 sensing material, which decreases the thickness of depletion layer and resistance Rg. The reaction between chemisorbed oxygen and formaldehyde can be described as follows:\nHCHO(ads)+2O−(ads) → CO2(gas)+H2O(gas)+2e− (1)\nIn summary, the enhanced formaldehyde response of the M4 sensing material is mainly attributed to the following aspects: unique nanoflowers hierarchical structure assembled from ultrathin nanosheets, large specific surface area, large proportion of oxygen vacancies, and the formation of p-n junction.\nThe selectivity of M4 gas sensor towards several gases was discussed by DFT calculations [65,66], and the models were revealed in Fig. S10. All DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package code. The projector augmented wave (PAW) [67] potentials and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [68] functionals were adopted to account for core-valance interactions. For all DFT calculations, Brillouin zone sampling was restricted to the Γ point with a grid of 3×3×1. The kinetic energy cutoff for plane wave basic set was 400 eV for structure optimization and the convergence threshold for geometry optimization was set to 10−4 eV. Geometry optimization was deemed converged when the forces on each atom was below 0.05 eV/Å. A 3× 3 SnO2 (1 1 0) surface with two O-Sn-O layers was geometry optimized to a minimum structure, in which surface atoms were relaxed. For the optimizations of gas molecules, all the atoms were allowed to relax in a 15 Å×15 Å×15 Å crystal. The adsorption enthalpy\nTable 2 The sensing performances of SnO2-based formaldehyde (HCHO) gas sensors.\nMaterials Method Temperature (°C) Response Response/Recovery Limit References\nAu@SnO2 Sol-gel 25 °C 2.9 (50 ppm) 80 s/62 s 20 ppm [24] SnO2/GO Electrospinning 120 °C 32.0 (100 ppm) 55 s/10 s 500 ppb [56] Pd-SnO2 Solvothermal 190 °C 1.7 (0.1 ppm) 53 s/103 s 50 ppb [57] NiO/SnO2 Coprecipitation 240 °C 27.6 (100 ppm) 4 s/18 s 130 ppb [58] Graphene/SnO2 Solvothermal 120 °C 4.9 (1 ppm) 1 s/85 s 1 ppm [59] SnO2/SnO Hydrothermal 120 °C 80.9 (50 ppm) 7 s/27 s 8.15 ppb This works\nFig. 9.

(c) and (d) schematic model for the SnO/SnO2 when they are exposed to air and formaldehyde ambient, respectively.\n(Eads) between gas molecule and SnO2 surface is defined as (Eq. 2).\nEads = ESnO2-gas - (Egas+ESnO2) (2)\nAs shown in Table 3, the adsorption enthalpy for detected gases are listed as follows：formaldehyde (1.2356 eV)＞ethanol (0.8035 eV)＞ methanol (0.7944 eV)＞acetone (0.6112 eV)＞benzene (0.1570 eV). The chemisorption of formaldehyde on (110) facet of SnO2 is stronger than other gases. So it is easier for formaldehyde to react with chemisorbed oxygen on SnO2 surface under the same conditions, which can reveal the selectivity of M4 gas sensor. And these results are consistent with Fig. 8(b)."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusion",
      "text" : "A one-pot hydrothermal method capable of forming a two-phase compound was excavated, the morphology and composition of synthesized material can be controlled by changing the molar ratio of the precursors. Studies have shown that the synthesized M4 sensing material behaves enhanced sensing performance for detecting formaldehyde including response value, selectivity, stability and other aspects compared with the other sensing materials. On the one hand, the M4 sensing material with a flower-like hierarchical structure assembled from ultra-thin nanosheets can provides a shorter gas diffusion path for the sensing process, a larger specific surface area, and more oxygen vacancies. The unique nanostructure and accompanying p-n junction synergistically enhance the gas sensing properties of M4 to detect formaldehyde. On the other hand, this work shows that gas sensor based on M4 sensing material has a potential for practical application in our life, and also provides some new ideas for the future research and development of gas sensor."

It was rationally designed and successfully synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal route. The crystal phase, defects, element composition and morphology of the obtained samples were characterized in detail by XRD, FESEM, TEM, Raman, PL, and XPS. The characterized results reveal that hierarchical SnO/SnO2 nano-flowers are assembled from ultrathin nanosheets with about 9–11 nm in thickness. Gas sensing performance shows that the sensor based on SnO/SnO2 nano-flowers has crucial advantages for formaldehyde detection, such as low operating temperature (120 °C), excellent selectivity, short response time (7 s), high response value (80.9) and low detection limitation (8.15 ppb). The excellent gas responses of the sensor can be attributed to its unique hierarchical microstructure (for decrease of Rg and increase of Ra) and p-n junction between SnO and SnO2 (for increase of Ra). Finally, the sensing mechanism of the prepared was proposed in detail.",
