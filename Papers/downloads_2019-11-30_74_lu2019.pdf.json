However, HPCS doesn't meet themechanical strength requirement in bone tissue engineering and is not suitable for cell adhesion and growth because of its hydrophilic nature and low crystallinity. In this study, nano-scaled hydroxyapatite (n-HA) and HPCS were synthesized, respectively, and then n-HA/HPCS nanocomposite scaffolds were developed by incorporating n-HA into HPCS matrix accompanied with crosslinking of HPCS by a naturally occurring compound, genipin (GP), which in turn greatly altered the hydrophilicity andmechanical properties. The nanocomposite scaffolds showed an open structure with interconnected pores and a rough morphology with n-HA inserted in the GP-crosslinked HPCS matrix. The porosity, swelling capacity, compressive strength,fluorescence emission and degradation rate can be regulated by varying GP concentrations and n-HA contents. An osteoconductive and osteogenic marine algae polysaccharide, fucoidan, was further adsorbed to the composite scaffolds via electrostatic interactions. Incorporation of n-HAand adsorption of FD into the composite scaffolds increased ALP activity in 7F2 osteoblast cells andpromoted theirmineralization. The FD-adsorbed n-HA/HPCS composite scaffolds can be a potential biomaterial for BTE applications.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

      "text" : "Augmentation of bone defects using biomaterials, combined with cells and growth factor together, which is known as bone tissue engineering (BTE), offers alternative therapeutic approaches in place of autograft and allograft to restore the function and repairing damaged bone tissue. In BTE, substitutes are engineered as scaffolds thatmustmeet the requirements of non-toxicity, non-immunogenicity, biocompatibility and osteoconductivity. BTE scaffolds should also have the basic physical properties including appropriate porosity and pore size, and high enough mechanical strength, as well as the biophysical properties that\n, School of Medicine, College of\ncan improve adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of osteogenic cells and osteoblasts, which are allowed to promote bone tissue regeneration and facilitate the repair of damaged bone tissue.\nNative bone is a unification of organic/inorganic composite materials, mainly made up of collagen, nano-scaled hydroxyapatite (n-HA) and small amount of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), proteoglycans and glycoproteins. Being inspired by the composition and architecture of the natural bone tissue, various composite scaffolds combined with inorganic and biological macromolecules for bone tissue engineering have been explored. Chitosan is a semi-crystalline, linear polysaccharide primarily composed of β-(1-4)-linked d glucosamine and N acetyl glucosamine subunits. Chitosan is biocompatible, biodegradable, nonantigenic and non-toxic and has multiple functions including osteoconductivity and antibacterial ability. With a structure similar to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), chitosan thereby can create a local microenvironment suitable for osteoblast proliferation, differentiation and mineralization [1,2]. Moreover, it allows for easy modification of\nchemical structures, fabrication of porous scaffolds and combination with inorganic nanoceramics to improve biological functions [3,4]; hence chitosan has been getting a lot of attention as an appropriate functional material for BTE in recent years. Chitosan demonstrates excellent antibacterial activity and adhesive property and thus also has been studied for used as dental barrier membrane and composite resin cement providing adhesion to enamel and dentin [5,6]. However, the applications of chitosan in development of ceramics-combined organic/inorganic composites for BTE are limited because chitosan is only soluble in acid.\nHydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCS) is a semisynthetic chitosan derivative easily dissolved in water. It has recently attracted increasing attention in biomedical applications due to their potential to be a desirable biocompatible and biodegradablematerial for cell growth and tissue regeneration [7–10]. HPCS has antibacterial and antioxidant activities [11–14], but it is easily dissolved in water and has poor mechanical property; hence, HPCS-based biomaterials have been cross-linked or photocross-linked [10,15], or modified with graphene oxide and soy protein isolate [7,8], to improve the mechanical property and reduce the hydrophilic property of the materials.\nHydroxyapatite (HA) is the fundamental inorganic component of bone consisting of hydroxyl groups and apatite denoted by itsmolecular formula Ca10(OH)2(PO4)6. HA in natural bone is a nano-scaled crystal capable of bonding with bone and stimulating bone growth and allowing the expression of bone forming osteogenic markers. Despite osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity of HA, it has several short comings includingbrittleness and is not easy to form a particular shape; thus limits its use for practical application. However, HA attracts special attention of being used as an additive to polymer-based composites for enhancing their mechanical and biological properties [16–24]. Taking into consideration the favorable biological and mechanical influence in bone formation, n-HA is thought to be a desirable candidate to be integrated with HPCS to synthesize ideal organic/inorganic composite for BTE applications.\nGenerally, from the bone tissue engineering perspective, HPCS would not meet the mechanical strength requirements because of its low crystallinity. Besides, the hydrophilic nature of water-soluble polymer materials is not suitable for protein adsorption and cell adhesion and growth [25]. The current work reports the cross-linking of HPCS with genipin (GP) to reduce its hydrophilic property and form stable hydrogels. Subsequently, n-HA/HPCS composite scaffolds were prepared from the GP-crosslinked n-HA/HPCS hydrogels, and then fucoidan (FD)was adsorbed to the scaffolds via electrostatic interaction. GP is a naturally occurring compound extracted from gardenia fruit, which is able to cross-link chitosan and its derivatives via formation of heterocyclic amines [26–29]. Our previous study report that GP has very low cytotoxicity and can beused to fabricate biomaterial constructs of chitosan-based hydrogels, scaffolds, films, beads, microspheres and nanoparticles [30–33]. FDs are a group of anionic polysaccharide extracted from brown algae which consist of fucose and sulfate ester groups. Several studies have revealed that FD elevated bone formation markers such as osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase [34,35]. The effects of FD on mineral deposition and the angiogenic effect of FDinduced osteoblastic differentiation through VEGF secretion have also been verified [36–38]. Furthermore, FD stimulates osteogenic differentiation in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and adipose-derived stromal cells [39,40]. For these reasons, FD has been used to prepare composite scaffolds or coat fibermats for the application in BTE [41–50].\nWe hypothesize that, in this study, the crosslinking of HPCS by GP and incorporating n-HA into HPCS matrix can reduce the hydrophilic property of HPCS and improve themechanical property of the prepared scaffolds. The n-HA embedded in the scaffolds accompanied with FD adsorbed on the surface may further improve bone formation including osteoconduction and osteogenesis, and affect the physicochemical properties (such asmorphology, porosity, surface composition, swelling capacity), biodegradation and cytotoxicity."

      "text" : "Fig. 1A shows the FT-IR spectra of CS andHPCS. The broad absorption band between 3600 and 3100 cm−1 are assigned to O\\\\H and N\\\\H stretching. Other characteristic absorption bands were found at 2929 cm−1 and 2871 cm−1 (aliphatic C\\\\H stretch), 1645 cm−1 (C_O stretch, amide I), 1645 cm−1 (C\\\\N stretch), 1156 cm−1 (C\\\\O\\\\C symmetric stretch) and 1078 cm−1 (C\\\\O stretch). After hydroxypropylation, the appearance of a new peak at 2976 cm−1 and characteristic bands at 1458 cm−1 and 1378 cm−1, indicating that the hydroxypropyl moiety was substituted on CS backbone [12]. Fig. 1B shows the 1H NMR spectra of HPCS before and after dialysis against distilled water. 1H NMR HPCS before dialysis (D2O, δ, ppm): 3.04 (H-2), 3.40–4.07 (H-3, H-4, H-5 and H-6), and 2.13 (acetamido group), and HPCS after dialysis (D2O, δ, ppm): 2.97 (H-2), 3.38–4.05 (H-3, H-4, H5 and H-6), and 2.07 (acetamido group). After dialysis, the impurity signals in the range of 3.40–3.62 ppmdisappeared. A strong peak appeared\nat 1.10 ppm in the spectra of HPCS, indicating the substitution of hydroxypropyl moiety on CS backbone [9,13,14]. The XRD patterns of nHA powder in Fig. 1C shows several characteristic peaks at 2θ = 26.1°, 32.1°, 33.3° 40.1°, 46.9°, 49.7°, 53.3° [18]. The TEM micrographs of nHA revealed that the morphology of the particles is rod shaped. Their particle sizes are mostly distributed in the range of 200–500 nm and the zeta potential is negative (Fig. 1D).\nHPCS is awater soluble chitosan derivative and thus should be crosslinked to maintain the desired structures, mechanical properties and stability of its 3D constructs when contacted by water [10,15]. In this study, GP was used as a naturally occurring reagent to cross-link HPCS and form hydrogels, and then the hydrogels were freeze-dried to prepare scaffolds. GP-crosslinked materials have a superior biocompatibility and a slower degradation rate than their glutaraldehyde-crosslinked counterparts [33]. HPCS solution at a concentration lower than 2.0%w/v was not easy to form hydrogels after reactionwith GP, hence, 2.0%HPCS was used to react with different concentrations of GP for the preparation of hydrogels and scaffolds. The viscosity of the polymer solution increased upon reaction with GP (Fig. 2A). Obviously, the viscosity increases with the increase of GP concentration, indicating that the cross-linking reaction is greatly affected by the mass ratio of GP to HPCS. GP is a gardenia fruit extracted naturally occurring compound which can cross-link primary amines to form blue colored heterocyclic compound [26,28,30]. Fig. 2B shows that theGP/HPCS blended solutions changed from transparent to blue and the color depth increased with\nthe increases of reaction time and GP concentration [27,32]. Fig. 2C and D show UV–VIS and FTIR spectra of HPCS cross-linked with GP. GP shows the characteristic peaks of O\\\\H stretching (3405 cm−1), C_C\\\\H stretching (3237 cm−1), ester's C_O stretching (1683 cm−1) and aromatic C_C stretching (1621 cm−1). The occurrence of GPinvolved cross-linking reaction was identified by the decreased intensity of the bands at 1683 cm−1 and 1621 cm−1 (AIR 1683 and AIR 1621) in IR spectra, and the increased intensity of an adsorption band at 600 nm (AVis 600) in Vis spectra because GP cross-link primary amines to form heterocyclic structures [29,31]. According to Fig. 2C and D, the intensity of AIR 1683 and AIR 1621 in the IR spectra of GP1% cross-linked HPCS were stronger than its GP0.1%, GP0.25% and GP0.5% cross-linked counterparts, indicating that a certain amount of GP was excess and still unreacted in the GP1% cross-linked HPCS after 24 h of reaction. The intensity of A600 in UV–VIS spectra increased with the increase of GP concentration and reaction time. These results suggest that high concentration of GP lead to faster cross-linking reaction. However, after 24 h of reaction, the maximum absorbance of the GP0.5% cross-linked HPCS is close to its GP1.0% cross-linked counterpart. Therefore, 0.5% GP was selected as an optimal concentration to cross-linking HPCS for the following studies.\nHPCS cross-linked with 1.0% and 0.5% GP show the faster gel formation rates (Fig. 3A). HPCS cross-linked with 1.0%, 0.5% and 0.25% GP formed gels at 10, 14 and 24 h post-reaction. However, HPCS crosslinked with 0.1% GP did not form hydrogels even after 48 h of reaction.\nThe rheological properties of HPCS before and after cross-linking with 0.5% GP were further examined. Fig. 3B shows the results of frequency sweeps for HPCS and the GP0.5%-crosslinked HPCS (insert). For the original HPCS sample, the G′ value is very low and G″ is slightly larger than G' because the liquid-like behavior of HPCS solution. The GP0.5%crosslinked HPCS hydrogel has a G′ value higher than G″ value over the entire range of frequencies, suggesting the formation of elastic gels. Fig. 3C shows fluorescence spectra of HPCS cross-linked with GP. The occurrence of GP-involved cross-linking reaction was identified by the appearance of an emission band at 625 nm under excitation at 430 nm. The genipin-involved cross-linking reaction occurs through a nucleophilic attack on genipin by the amino groups of HPCS, resulting in the opening of thedihydropyran ring and the formation of aπ-π* conjugated heterocyclic genipin derivative, thus explaining the fluorescent characteristics of theGP-cross-linkedHPCS hydrogels [30]. The intensity of the fluorescence emission increases with the increase of the GP concentration used for cross-linking HPCS, as indicated by the change of their colors under excitation with a blue light at 430 nm. These results further confirm the fact that high concentration of GP lead to faster cross-linking reaction. CLSM imaging of the hydrogels prepared by cross-linking of HPCS with different concentration of GP shows that the fluorescence intensity are stronger in 0.5% and 1.0% GP-crosslinked HPCS hydrogels than in 0.1% and 0.25% GP-cross-linked counterparts (Fig. 3D). The results indicate that the GP-crosslinked HPCS hydrogelsmay beuseful forfluorescence imaging in biomedical applications. The schematic cross-linking reaction of HPCS with GP for the\nformation of GP-crosslinked HPCS networks and the preparation of HPCS-based composite scaffolds are shown in Fig. 4."

      "text" : "A composite that have a higher mechanical strength can help to increase alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin expression and calcium deposits [51]. HPCS is a water soluble chitosan derivative which has poormechanical propertywhen contacted bywater. Hence, the synthesized n-HAwas incorporated into the GP-crosslinked HPCS hydrogels to further reduce its hydrophilic property and improve its mechanical property, and then the chemical and physical properties of the freezedried composite scaffolds were characterized. HA is an important compound that can be combined with biopolymers for BTE because it stimulates osteoconduction, improves the mechanical strength, and alters the degradation behavior [22,44,45]. Thus, HPCS was blended with the synthesized n-HA and then the mixture was cross-linked with GP and lyophilized to produce n-HA/HPCS composite scaffolds. The SEM images with different magnification and EDS analysis of each scaffold are shown in Fig. 5A and B. The SEM images of HPCS scaffolds shows interconnected pores with pore size above 100 μm. With addition of n-HA, the structure of n-HA/HPCS composite scaffolds remained porous but the pore volume was found to decrease because of the deposition of n-HA coarse particulate on the pore walls (Fig. 5A). Macroporous scaffolds were reported to be of great benefit to cell growth andmicrotissue survival [52]. Accordingly, the prepared n-HA/HPCS composite porous\nnge, (C) time-dependent absorption spectra, (D) FTIR spectra of 2%HPCS cross-linkedwith\nscaffold is benefit to support in the growth, proliferation and differentiation of bone cells. The elemental EDS spectrum of HPCS scaffold shows several signals of C, O and N related to the components of the scaffold; however, the n-HA/HPCS composite scaffolds additionally contain the signals of Ca (Kα=3.690 Kev) and P (Kα=2.013 Kev) [18,45,52], suggesting that n-HA homogeneously covering the pores wall of the scaffolds (Fig. 5B). The intensity of P and Ca increases in n-HA (10%)/HPCS and n-HA (5.0%)/HPCS scaffolds as compared to that of n-HA (1.0%)/ HPCS scaffold. The XRD patterns of HPCS and n-HA/HPCS scaffolds were shown in Fig. 5C. The XRD of HPCS scaffold showed the characteristic peaks at around 2θ = 21.5o. The appearance of the characteristic crystalline peaks at 2θ = 26.1, 32.4, 40.3, 47.2, 50.1, etc. for n-HA/ HPCS scaffolds is related to (0 0 2) and (2 1 1) planes in n-HA, which confirmed the incorporation of n-HA in the composite scaffolds [17,18,53]. Fig. 5D shows the FTIR spectra of n-HA powder and n-HA/ HPCS composite scaffolds. The FTIR spectra of n-HA/HPCS composites show the characteristic bands of HA at 562, 601, 1035, 1091, 1417, 1642 and 3445 cm−1 [16,50], corresponding to the stretching vibration and out of plane bending of asymmetric and symmetric stretching of HPO42− and PO43− (565, 602, 1035, and 1091 cm−1), CO32– ions (1637 cm−1) and\\\\OH groups (3445 cm−1) [54]. All the n-HA/HPCS composites show the characteristic bands of HPCS (3450, 2970 and 1460 cm−1). The characteristic absorption bands for HA increase with the increase of the n-HA-to-HPCS ratio used for producing n-HA/HPCS composite scaffolds, indicating that more n-HA were incorporated in the n-HA (10%)/HPCS scaffolds.\nFD is a negatively charged polysaccharide and thus can be adsorbed to the positively chargedHPCS via the formation of electrostatic interactions [32]. After immersing the n-HA (10%)/HPCS scaffolds in FD solution (2%), FD was adsorbed to the surface of the scaffolds and made it smoother (Fig. 6A). This is due to the surface of the composite scaffold is partly covered by FD. The signal of S (Kα = 2.307 kev) assigned to FD was observed, indicating successful adsorption of FD to the scaffolds (Fig. 6B). The XRD of the FD-adsorbed n-HA (10%)/HPCS scaffolds showed the characteristic peaks of n-HA compared to the n-HA (10%)/ HPCS scaffolds (Fig. 6C), indicating that n-HA were mostly kept in the FD-adsorbed HPCS scaffolds. The FTIR spectra of the FD-adsorbed nHA/HPCS composites show the characteristic bands including amine, hydroxypropyl, and amide I and amide II groups of HPCS, sulfate ester groups (S_O and C\\\\O\\\\S stretching) of FD, and PO43− and HPO42− groups of HA (Fig. 6D), revealing that the FD-adsorbed scaffold combines HPCS, n-HA and FD together."

      "text" : "Porosity, hydration and swelling of scaffolds are related to cell infiltration, nutrient supply and metabolite transport, yet the swelling ratio should be controlled to prevent the cause of decreased mechanical stability. The porosities of HPCS scaffolds were 90.2%, respectively, which were higher than n-HA/HPCS and FD-adsorbed n-HA/HPCS scaffolds (Fig. 7A). Generally, an increased concentration of n-HA reduced the porosity of HPCS scaffolds. Recent studies have shown that physical\nproperties of scaffolds such as porosity, pore size and pore connectivity have very significant effects on nutrient and growth factor supplementation, cell migration and growth, which the direct influence of the scaffolds on osteogenic differentiation [54]. The porosities of n-HA/HPCS composite scaffolds were in the range of 61.5–81.2%, depending on the amount of n-HA (1%, 5% and 10%) in the scaffolds (Fig. 7A). The decreased porosities of n-HA (5%)/HPCS and n-HA (10%)/HPCS scaffolds are attributed to the presence of abundant n-HA particles [16]. Adsorption of FD on the n-HA (10%)/HPCS scaffolds didn't obviously alter the porosities of the scaffolds. Thus, the results reveal that the porosity wasmajorly affected by the amount of n-HA in the composite scaffolds, and the porosity of thus prepared composite scaffolds can meet the requirement for BTE.\nFig. 7B shows the swelling behavior of GP-crosslinked n-HA/HPCS scaffolds. HPCSwithout cross-linking by GP quickly and completely dissolved inwater (within 1 h); hence its equilibrium swelling ratiowasn't measured. Cross-linking of HPCS with GP (0.5%) converts HPCS from water soluble to insoluble and thus the equilibrium swelling ratio was measured to be 25. The formation of stable and insoluble GPcrosslinked HPCS scaffolds is attributed to the fact that GP reacts with the amino groups of HPCS and forms a hydrophobic heterocyclic amine to obtain cross-linked networks [26,28,31]. Incorporation of nHA into HPCS matrix has significant effects on reducing swelling capacity of the composite scaffolds. As shown in Fig. 7B, the decrease in swelling ratio with increased amount of n-HA in the GP-crosslinked HPCS scaffolds was due to the reason that n-HA formed a barrier against water permeation and diminished pore volume [16]. Besides, the network elongation of polymer matrix can be restricted after crosslinking of HPCS with GP, leading to synergistic decrement in swelling\ncapacity [22]. The FD-adsorbed n-HA (10%)/HPCS scaffold reached a maximumswelling ratiowithin 1 h followed bydecreasing the swelling, revealing that the adsorbed FD gradually released from the scaffolds."

      "text" : "Degradation is an important property to be investigated in BTE because the mechanical strength and structures of the scaffolds can be changed by degradation [55]. The glycosidic linkages in the structure of CS are known to be susceptible to lysozyme digestion [21]. However, the hydrophilic nature of HPCS and high porosity of the scaffolds even enhances their degradation progression over time [50]. The degradation rates of HPCS scaffolds can be reduced by the increase of GP concentration because the scaffolds exhibited high resistance to enzymatic degradation by increasing the level of covalent linkage between polymer chains [16]. HPCS scaffolds showed higher degradation rates compared with n-HA/HPCS composite scaffolds, which was attributed to the increase in hydrophobicity with the addition of HA (Fig. 7C). The results indicated that the degradation rate could be controlled by changing the GP concentration and n-HAp amount and thus the composite scaffolds can be replaced with new bone at a desirable rate without reducing themechanical strength at a fast rate. The FD-adsorbed n-HA (10%)/ HPCS scaffold shows a higher degradation rate compared with its FDfree counterpart, which can be attributed to the release of adsorbed FD together with the degradation of the scaffold matrix.\nThe mechanical strengths of porous scaffolds prepared from biopolymers generally are too low to support bone tissue regeneration and therefore a number of studies have been devoted to develop nHAp/polymer composite scaffolds with improved mechanical\nproperties [16,39]. In this study, the effects of cross-linking of HPCS by GP and insertion of n-HAp on themechanical properties of the composite scaffolds were evaluated by determining their compressive strength (Fig. 7D). HPCS solution and n-HA/HPCS blends can't form hydrogels without cross-linking by GP (0%), and thus HPCS and n-HA/HPCS scaffolds without cross-linked by GP aren't available even after lyophilization. The compressive strength was moderately increased by increasing the GP concentration but was dramatically increased by increasing the amount of n-HAp. The compressive strength of HPCS scaffolds cross-linked with high concentration of GP (1.0% w/v) are higher than that cross-linked with low concentration of GP (0.1% w/v) (p b 0.05). The stiffness of the scaffolds was improved because more rigid structures were produced by intramolecular cross-linking of polymer matrix [22]. Besides, the compressive strength increased from 19.1 KPa to 52.8 KPa with increasing the amount of n-HA from 1.0% to 10%. The increase in the values of the compressive strength is believed to be the reason that the functional groups of HPCS form chemical interactions with Ca2+ and PO4− of n-HAp, as well as the fact that n-HAp reduces the number of open pores and increased mechanical interlocking within the matrix [16,21,56]. However, the compressive strength of the n-HAp/HPCS scaffolds was higher than that of the FD-adsorbed scaffolds. The reduction of compressive strength of FD-adsorbed n-HA/ HPCS scaffold was possibly due to the removal of some n-HA from the scaffold. By immersing n-HA/HPCS scaffold into FD solution for adsorption, some n-HA could be washed away. As shown in Fig. 7D, the nHA contents in the n-HA/HPCS scaffolds were positive correlation with their compressive strengths, so the compressive strength of the n-HA/ HPCS scaffold after adsorption of FD became lower than the original nHA/HPCS scaffold. Furthermore, the repeat washing, freezing and\nlyophilization to obtain the FD-adsorbed scaffold can also reduce the compressive strength."

      "text" : "Shakir et al. reported that a ternary nanocomposite consisting of nHA, chitosan and starch (n-HA/CS–ST) with an average size between 12 nm and 17 nm showed a superior non-toxic nature [57], and the nanocomposites of resol resin (RS) incorporated with chitosan and nHA (CHA) having average size ranging between 12 and 19 nm are neither nephrotoxic nor hepatotoxic [58]. Another study showed that a composite composed of n-HA with an average size larger than 100 nm, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and gelatin (Gel) was detected to be non-cytotoxicity in vitro and was biocompatible in vivo [59]. Therefore, the size of n-HAmay be not the only factor that affects the cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of n-HA/polymer composite scaffolds. The cytotoxicity effect of the scaffolds prepared in this work was evaluated using 7F2 osteoblast cells. MTT results indicated that GP-crosslinked HPCS and n-HA/HPCS composites did not exhibit obvious toxic effect on osteoblast cells. The results confirmed non-toxic nature of the synthesized scaffolds which suggested good cytocompatibility for 7F2 osteoblast cells (Fig. 8A). The osteoconduction and osteogenesis effects of the scaffolds were evaluated by the activity of alkaline phosphatase enzyme (ALP), which is a biochemical marker of osteoblast phenotype. The ALP activity of the cells cultured with different scaffolds was investigated at 3 and 6 days (Fig. 8B). The relative ALP activity was increased in the osteoblast cells cultured on n-HA/HPCS composite scaffolds compared to the cells cultured on CS and HPCS scaffolds without n-HA. Several studies reported that the addition of HA to polymer matrix\nimproves the osteoblast and MSCs cells attachment and proliferation [20], which can be attributed to upregulation of ALP triggered by the rougher surface of n-HA/HPCS scaffolds [21]. Some studies have also shown that FD promoted osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells and enhanced osteoconduction in osteoblast cells as indicated by the ALP expression [43,48]. Another research reported that hydroxyapatite-fucoidan bionanocomposites was beneficial in stimulating the osteoblastic activity resulting in bone formation [47]. The increase in ALP activity was observed for n-HA/HPCS scaffolds adsorbed with FD compared to the group cultured with FD-free scaffolds (*P b 0.05). Calcium deposition in osteoblastic cells was further examined as indicated by the appearance of the red color from alizarin red staining. Fig. 8C shows that calcium deposits in n-HA/HPCS and FD-adsorbed nHA/HPCS scaffolds were higher than HPCS scaffold on day 6 (**P b 0.01). The higher levels of calcium deposits in the cells cultured with n-HA/HPCS scaffolds can be explained in terms of the increased mineralization that is linked with osteoconductive activities of the composite scaffolds. It has been proven that the scaffolds composed of HA and CS supported proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and improved the osteoinductivity [56]. Other researches have shown that fucoidan induced the mineralization in osteoblast cells, MSCs and human-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells [44,45,49]. The results suggested that n-HA and FD have excellent capacity to induce mineralization, which depicted that the treatment of these scaffolds promotes osteoconduction and osteogenesis in vitro and might be an important parameter for bone repair."

      "text" : "A potentially bioactive n-HA/HPCS nanocomposites were synthesized by incorporation of synthesized n-HA into HPCS solution, followed by crosslinking of the n-HA/HPCS blends with GP to obtain the nanocomposite hydrogels and scaffolds. Additionally, an osteoconductive and osteogenic marine algae polysaccharide FD was adsorbed to the n-HA/HPCS composite scaffolds. Crosslinking of HPCS by GP and inclusion of n-HA had obvious effects on altering the chemical and physical properties such as reducing hydrophilic property, controlling porous architecture, improving mechanical strength and decreasing the degradability of the scaffolds. Incorporation of n-HA and adsorption of FD to the composite scaffolds increased ALP activity in 7F2 osteoblast cells and promoted their mineralization. From the results, it can be concluded that the FD-adsorbed n-HA/HPCS composite scaffolds can be a potential biomaterial for BTE applications."
