      "text" : "Uranium (VI), as the most important element in the nuclear industry, would be depleted by the end of this century with the rapid development of nuclear industrialization if the used fuels are not recycled [1]. Additionally, its assimilation would lead to kidney failure or even death [2]. Hence, it is imperative to immobilize U(VI) from aqueous solutions before releasing it into environment. Until now, various materials for U(VI) immobilization have been reported, such as DFNS [3], GO [4], magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles [5] and titanate nanotubes [6]. However, they also suffered their drawbacks of complicate synthesis and low performance immobilization. Hence, high-performance immobilization of U(VI) by new materials with simple synthesis is significant for sustainable utilization of uranium resources and environmental protection.\nRecently, nanostructured metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), consisting of metal ions coordinated by organic ligands, emerged as new candidates for effective treatment of U(VI) because of their tunable structural topology, pore size and functionality [7–9]. For instance, Lin et al. utilized UiO-68 MOFs to extract U(VI) from aqueous solutions with Qmax of 217 mg g−1 [10]. Other MOFs also exhibited high U(VI) extraction performance, such as MIL-101 [11], CMPO-MIL-101 [12] and MOF-76 [13]. However, these reported MOFs materials always showed three-dimensional isotropic polyhedrons with sizes greater than 100 nm, while the utility of these two-dimensional (2D) nano-sheets materials for U(VI) adsorption remains a vacancy, making it rather an interesting direction to explore.\nGenerally, high-aspect-ratio nanostructured materials with extended lateral dimensions and (sub)nanometer thickness often exhibit exotic physicochemical properties radically different from those of their isotropic (bulk) counterparts, possessing larger surface area and more accessible active sites for the substrate molecules with a smaller diffusion barrier [14,15]. As a result, 2D MOFs realize their advanced structures for various applications, such as MALDI-TOF matrices, membrane separation, and energy storage in comparison with conventional 3D MOFs materials [16]. Conventionally, 2D MOFs nanosheets can be prepared by a variety of methodologies, such as liquid exfoliation [17], ultra-sonication exfoliation [18], layer-by-layer growth [19], and surfactant-assisted synthesis [20]. However, these methodologies always suffer their disadvantages [21–23]. Moreover, these complex synthetic methods cannot be scaled up. Hence, exploring new method for the synthesis of 2D MOFs nano-sheets materials is of great interest and yet remains a challenge.\nHerein, a new kind of thin 2D MOFs nano-sheets was successfully prepared through complexation between 2-methylimidazole (MeimiH) (Figure S1) and Cu(II) by a one-step method at ambient temperature. Simultaneously, several MeOH/H2O volume ratios were applied for synthesizing Cu-MeimiH based MOFs nano-sheets (MNS), to probe its effect on the physicochemical properties and functionalities of the resulting 2D MOFs nano-sheets. The obtained materials with MeOH/H2O volume ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4 were denoted as MNS-1, MNS-2, MNS-3 and MNS-4, respectively. Additionally, the obtained MNS samples were characterized systematically and explored their U(VI) immobilization performance. The successful preparation of 2D MOFs nano-sheets can enrich the category of MOFs materials to immobilize U (VI) from liquid medium because of their few applications in this field [24]."

      "text" : "To investigate the phase purity of the obtained samples, XRD patterns were carried out and shown in Fig. 1. The XRD patterns are identical for all the obtained samples and in good agreement with previously reported MeimiH based MOFs materials, suggesting its similar structure with other MeimiH based MOFs materials [25,26]. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.52°, 29.68°, 31.54°, 33.16°, 35.68°, 38.8°, 44.88°, and 48.08° corresponded to (0 2 2), (0 4 4), (0 0 6), (0 2 6), (2 2 6), (1 2 7), (3 5 6) and (0 1 9), respectively. Moreover, the strong and sharp peaks of obtained XRD patterns suggested its high crystallization. Furthermore, the obtained samples are also expected to be of high purity due to the detection of no other impurity peaks.\nThe functional groups of MNSs samples were detected through FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 2). Similar characteristic peaks were observed in all composites, suggesting their similar functional groups, although organized in different solvent ratios. And the detailed assignments of spectral peaks were given as follows. The broad absorption band located at 3428 cm−1 can be owing to the stretching vibrations of both −OH and hydrogen-bonded H2O molecules on its surface. Two peaks\nlocated at 3131 and 2920 cm−1 are attributed to the aromatic CeH and aliphatic stretching vibrations of the imidazole, respectively. The peak at 1565 cm−1 is assigned as the NeH stretching vibration of the imidazole ring. The intense and convoluted bands at 1350–1500 cm−1 are associated with the entire ring stretching [27,28]. Peaks in the region of 900 and 1350 cm−1 are assigned as in-plane bending of the imidazole ring, while the bands located at 741 and 693 cm−1 in the spectral region are associated with out-of-plane bending. The absorption peaks at 432 cm−1 could be owing to Cu–N stretching vibration, suggesting the successful coordination of Cu(II) with MeimiH. Moreover, the consistent spectra of MNS samples with the reported MeimiH based MOFs further corroborated the successful preparation of MeimiH and Cu(II) based other MOFs materials [29,30].\nFig. 2b displayed the Raman spectra of the obtained samples, which are dominated by the intense bands corresponding to methyl group and imidazole ring vibrations. And the band assignments have been summarized in Table S1 [31–33]. The band observed at 278 cm−1 can be assigned to Cu − N stretching, while the bands observed at 690 and 1462 cm−1 are attributed to imidazolium ring puckering, and methyl bending, respectively. The band around 2937 cm−1corresponds to a methyl CeH stretching vibration. The Raman modes of all obtained samples are located in the same position, suggesting their structural equalities.\nIn order to investigate the thermal stabilities of the obtained samples, thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out (Figure S2). Similar chromatograms were obtained, and all MNS samples were stable up to 242 ℃. The weight loss above this temperature can be attributed to the departure of H2O and MeOH molecules in the composites, followed with the decomposition of the MOFs structure. In details, MNS-1 suffered a total weight loss of 52.82% at 377 ℃, while that of MNS-2 is 55.77% at 437 ℃. MNS-3 and MNS-4 exhibited similar total weight loss of 59.07% at 465 ℃. The differences of pyrolysis process are attributed to the different coordination patterns. More MeimiH molecules are expected to coordinate with Cu(II) with decreasing the solvent ratios of MeOH/H2O from 1:1 to 1:3 and unchanged for 1:4. The higher thermal stability of the latter composites may be attributed to their increased MeimiH content, as the coordination of more MeimiH molecules with Cu(II) is expected to enhance the thermal stability.\nFig. 3 showed the typical SEM images of the products obtained under various MeOH/H2O volume ratios, which all presented densely packed irregular sheet-like nanostructure and smooth surfaces. Although all the samples presented irregular sheet-like nanostructure, the morphologies of the products exhibited differences in thickness and size with decreasing the volume ratios of MeOH/H2O. The lateral sizes were failed to be measured due to their irregular shapes. However, it can still be clearly observed that the lateral sizes in micro-size of nano-sheets\nbecame larger with decreasing the volume ratios of MeOH/H2O, which was further corroborated by the TEM images (Fig. 4). Fig. 4a showed the TEM image of MNS-1 with a thickness of sub-10 nm. With decreasing volume ratio of MeOH/H2O to 1:2, MNS-2 presents uniformly in the horizontal direction with a thickness of sub-11 nm. The thicknesses were further increased to 20 and 25 nm for MNS-3 and MNS-4, respectively, indicating an influential factor of MeOH/H2O volume ratio to the morphologies of MNS and further affecting their U(VI) immobilization performance. Moreover, as evidenced by the SEM and TEM observations, the sizes of nano-sheets became larger and much more agglomerated with decreasing the MeOH/H2O volume ratio, which can be explained as follows. The precipitation process of MOFs mainly consists of a four-step growth process, i.e. nucleation (I), island growth around the nuclei (II), intergrowth (III) and a detachment phase (IV) [34]. Both stages I and II are affected by solvent acidity and viscosity, as diffusion is important in these stages. With decreasing the MeOH/H2O volume ratio, the solvent acidity and viscosity began to decrease, which would further lead to the significant decrease of mass transport rate from one phase/component to another [35]. This phenomenon may contribute to the local concentrated regions for reaction and agglomeration. Hence, increased solvent acidity and viscosity will lead to the larger particle size and increased agglomeration of the products, resulting in different U(VI) capture performances.\nFig. 5 showed the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms measured at 77 K. The profile of the isotherms shows a type IV isotherm for all samples, which is characteristic of microporous materials [36]. The MNS-1 featured a specific surface area (SBET) and pore volume (Vpore) of 52.5 m2 g−1 and 0.246 cm3 g−1, respectively. Interestingly, with decreasing the solvent volume ratio of MeOH/H2O to 1:2, the SBET of MNS-2 increased to 57.9 m2 g−1. The enhancement in surface area of MNS-2 was also accompanied by an increase in its Vpore of 0.311 cm3 g−1. However, with a steady decrease of solvent volume ratio to 1:3 and 1:4, SBET of both MNS-3 and MNS-4 started to decrease to 56.4 and 43.6 cm3 g−1, respectively, as well as decreased Vpore values to 0.308 and 0.176 cm3 g−1, respectively. The largest SBET of MNS-2 can be attributed to the more voids at its interface because of specific solvent volume ratio of MeOH/H2O, which probably created more micropores in the nano-sheets. Furthermore, as shown in the inset graph, the corresponding pore size distribution of the samples exhibited hierarchically porous structure with their average pore diameters of 26.71, 31.76, 32.90 and 38.96 nm, respectively. The SBET, Vpore and average pore diameters of the obtained samples were summarized in Table S2. The large specific surface area, abundant pore volume and mesoporous size distribution would be beneficial to the exposure of more active sites and great U(VI) immobilization performance from aqueous solutions."

      "text" : "In order to estimate the U(VI) immobilization rate onto the four MOFs adsorbents, the kinetic experiments were carried out under pH 6.0. As illustrated in Fig. 6, almost every MOFs material exhibited an ultra-fast U(VI) adsorption process within the initial 45 min. Afterwards, the adsorption rate of U(VI) slowed down, and the kinetic processes reached their equilibria within 2 h, which is comparable with the reported functionalized mesoporous silicas (< 2 h) [37,38], but much faster than that of 20 h for MCM-41 [39], and 24 h for MWCNT-g-CMC [40]. Moreover, a slightly higher adsorption capacity of U(VI) onto MNS-2 was observed as compared with the other three nano-sheets. This phenomenon can be explained by more active sites and relatively larger surface area of MNS-2 on its surface. Furthermore, to achieve the adsorption saturation of U(VI) onto the adsorbents, the mixed solution of adsorbate and adsorbent took place adsorption reaction for more than 2 h in the following immobilization experiments.\nTo obtain more in-depth information of the immobilization process, adsorption data were simulated through the following kinetic models, i.e. pseudo-first order kinetic model, second-order kinetics model and particle diffusion model [41–43]. More model details and parameters, as well as the fitted curves were listed in Table S3 and Figure S3-S4. And the fitting results were shown in Table 1. Based on the correlation coefficients (R2) of ≥ 0.98 for all the four adsorbents, one can reach the conclusion that the pseudo-second-order model can better simulate the U(VI) adsorption data, indicating a chemisorption U(VI) adsorption process [44]. Furthermore, according to previous reports, the\nadsorption process could be described in three stages: (1) film diffusion, (2) intra-particle diffusion and (3) adsorption of the adsorbate on the surface [13,37]. One or more of these stages may determine the rate of adsorption on the solid surface. As illustrated in Figure S4, the adsorption data fitted by intra-particle diffusion model exhibited nonlinear fitting result, demonstrating a multi-stage adsorption process. Moreover, the obtained sample exhibited fast adsorption rate during inception, which can be explained by the U(VI) with higher concentration and abundant active sites, and the two of which could accelerate mass transfer from liquid environment to the solid surface. Subsequently, the adsorption rate started to slow down, since the limited available active sites suffered a decrease and U(VI) ions diffused more slowly from the adsorbent surface to its inner porous structure. Finally, the adsorption process reached its equilibrium when the adsorbent was saturated. These results reveal that intra-particle diffusion as well as the surface adsorption together affected the adsorption rate."

      "text" : "The immobilization process is greatly affected by the solution pH value, which is mainly manifested in two aspects, affecting solution U (VI) speciation and the solid adsorbent surface charge. Herein, the pH effect on U(VI) immobilization was investigated in pH scale of 3-12. According to Fig. 7, the U(VI) immobilization onto all tested materials was strongly dependent on solution pH values. All materials exhibit negligible uptake of U(VI) when the pH was below 5, whereas the adsorption capacity dramatically reached more than 200 mg g−1 at pH\n8.0. This phenomenon clearly indicates that these nano-sheets can be served as attractive materials in removing U(VI) at neutral or weak basic conditions. Further increment of pH values would decrease immobilization capacity. Since all the obtained materials exhibited similar pH-dependent U(VI) adsorption process and MNS-2 has the best removal performance, the following discussion about the pH effect will be given based on the adsorption data from MNS-2 (Scheme 1).\nThe pH-dependent U(VI) adsorption process could be explained by the protonation and deprotonation process of functional groups on MOFs, accompanying with transformation of U(VI) species varying\nsolution pH values. Figure S5 and Table S4 display the distributions of different U(VI) species in various acid-base solutions, clearly indicating that the major existence forms of U(VI) is UO22+ and UO2OH+ when the solution pH value was less than 5. Since the pHpzc of MNS-2 is 7.37 (Figure S6), the surface of MNS-2 is also positively charged because of its surface protonation process. Hence, the poor immobilization performance of MNS-2 in low pH solution can be explained with the electrostatic repulsion between the uranium cations (UO22+, UO2OH+) and its electropositive surface. With increasing solution pH values, U (VI) transformed from free uranium cations (UO22+, UO2OH+) to UO2(OH)+, (UO2)4(OH)7+, (UO2)3(OH)5+ in pH scale of 6.0–8.0. The greatly enhanced adsorption performance of MNS-2 in this range can be\nexplained by the adsorbent’s stronger affinity with the multi-nuclear hydroxide complexes of U(VI), which became dominant at higher pH values. However, with continuously increasing pH value, the U(VI) major existence forms were anionic hydroxide compounds, including UO2(OH)42−, (UO2)3(OH)7-, and UO2(OH)3-. And the decreased adsorption performance of MNS-2 can be also explained with the electrostatic repulsion between anionic hydroxide compounds and negatively charged MNS-2. Therefore, pH 6.0 was selected for subsequent adsorption experiments to ensure that no significant hydrolysis or precipitation of U(VI) during the experimental process.\nFurthermore, the U(VI) immobilization performance onto MNS-2 influenced by ionic strength was also investigated using different concentrations of NaNO3. As shown in Fig. 7, the increase of ionic strength brought no distinct effect on U(VI) immobilization within pH 4.0–8.0, while the increase of ionic strength enhanced the uptake of U(VI) at pH > 8.0. Hence, the U(VI) immobilization was achieved by the\npotential occurrence of the inner-sphere complexation and/or precipitation reactions [45]. Furthermore, the effects of Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations on U(VI) immobilization by MNS-2 have also been investigated to acquire the selectivity of MNS-2. As illustrated in Figure S7, the U(VI) immobilization efficiency has exceeded more than 79% at a very wide range of Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations. Although the introduction of these metal ions would somewhat suppress U(VI) immobilization, ascribing to the formation of ternary complexes between U(VI) and alkaline metals or alkaline earth metals [46,47], it is still notable that MNS-2 kept an excellent U(VI) immobilization efficiency even with a tremendous excess of these metal ions concentrations (9–5045 times of molar ratio to U(VI) ions). Hence, it can be confirmed that the MNS-2 presented an ideal selectivity for U (VI) immobilization against other coexisting cations in aqueous solutions. According to the above results, it could be anticipated that the MOFs-based adsorbents can be efficiently applied in entrapping U(VI) from wastewater with high salinities, such as seawater systems."

      "heading" : "3.4. Adsorption isotherms of U(VI)",
      "text" : "To further evaluate the ability of MOFs to capture U(VI), the isotherm experiments with various U(VI) concentrations were carried out at three different temperatures. The results were shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that U(VI) adsorption amounts increased rapidly at its lower concentrations while they gradually increased at its higher concentrations, indicating that saturated adsorption can be achieved by higher initial U(VI) concentration. The phenomenon that the adsorption capacity increased moderately rather than exponentially with the increasing U(VI) concentration is also a strong contradictory evidence of any possible occurring of U(VI) precipitation during the adsorption process. Hence, the highly-efficient elimination of U(VI) is a result of adsorption instead of precipitation, also confirmed by the pH effect analysis. The isotherm data were analyzed by the Langmuir, Freundlich and D–R adsorption models. And the equations of Langmuir, Freundlich and D–R adsorption models were illustrated as following [48–50]:\nScheme 1. Schematic of the fabrication of Cu(II)-based 2D MOFs nano-sheets.\n= + q Q bC bC1e e\ne\nmax\n(1)\n=q K Ce F e n1/ (2)\n=q Q exp( )e max 2 (3)\n= +RT C ln(1 1 ) e (4)\nwhere qe (mg·g−1) is the amount of U(VI) adsorbed at equilibrium state. Qmax (mg·g−1) is the maximum theoretical removal amount. The b (L·g1) is the equilibrium constant. KF, accompanying with n, known as Freundlich constant, are indicators of the adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity, respectively. β (mol2 kJ-2) is the activity coefficient, which is relevant to the adsorption mean free energy, and ε represents the Polanyi potential.\nThe fitting parameters from the above three formulas were provided in Fig. 8, Figure S8 and Table S5-S8, respectively. It can be clearly seen that the values of Qmax decreased with increasing the temperature from 298 to 333 K. And the b values also decreased with increasing temperature, displaying that higher temperatures were unfavorable for U(VI) capture. Besides, the n values at all temperatures were between 1 and 10, designating again that the adsorption was favorable. By comparing the R2 values, the Langmuir isotherm model simulated U(VI) adsorption data better than Freundlich isotherm model, indicating a monolayer uniform immobilization mechanism. This result also corresponds to our previous assumption that U(VI) was predominantly immobilized by these adsorbents via surface complexation. Moreover, the Qmax values of MNS-1, MNS-2, MNS-3 and MNS-4 at 293 K are 384.84, 591.77, 409.48, 387.07 mg·g−1, respectively. Generally speaking, there are several factors affecting the immobilization performance of the adsorbents, such as surface area, surface charge, abundancy of functional groups and morphological characteristics. Based on the BET analysis, the surface areas of MNS samples follow the order of MNS2 > MNS-3 > MNS-1 > MNS-4. The order of the first three is coincident with that of absorbability, demonstrating that larger surface area is favorable for the adsorption performance in a way. However, the\norder of the latter two is reversed to that of absorbability, suggesting that the surface area is not the only factor affecting the adsorption performance of adsorbents. Moreover, the pHpzc values of MNS samples followed the order of MNS-4(7.64) > MNS-2(7.37) > MNS3(7.29) > MNS-1(6.92), which is inconsistent with that of absorbability, demonstrating pHpzc is not the only factor affecting its adsorption performance. Furthermore, the amount of MeimiH molecules in the MNS samples follows the order of MNS-3 = MNS-4 > MNS2 > MNS-1 (Figure S2), which is reversed to that of absorbability. Although both MNS-3 and MNS-4 have more coordinated MeimiH molecules, their adsorption performances are not the best among the obtained samples. This can be explained by the steric hindrance effect of imidazole rings and the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds present in the MNS samples. The aforementioned factors can lead to the comparatively lower U(VI) immobilization by MNS-3 and MNS-4. And MNS-2 owns the highest immobilization capacity of the four obtained adsorbents, which could be explained by the relatively larger surface area, appropriate surface charge and suitable abundancy of functional groups. Furthermore, a list for the comparison Qmax of U(VI) using various adsorbents was provided in Table 2 to characterize the adsorption performance of the obtained MNS samples. As illustrated in Table 2, the obtained MNS-2 exhibited the equilibrium time, removal rate and saturated adsorption capacity of 2 h, 97.6% and 591.79 mg g−1, respectively, which were comparable or even better to the other reported 3D MOFs, such as MIL-101-DETA [57], FJSM-SnS [58], and Zn-MOF-74 [59]. Moreover, the 2D MOFs were superior to traditional inorganic materials in equilibrium time, removal rate and saturated adsorption capacity, for instance activated carbon [51], AA-gBT [52], and NiSiO@NiAl [53]. These data clearly indicated that the 2D MOFs is a quite promising adsorbent in immobilization of U(VI) from aqueous solutions.\nIn addition, D-R isotherm model is always utilized to distinguish whether the adsorption process is physical or a chemical process according to its parameter of mean free energy E (E = (2β)−1/2 kJ·mol-1). Based on previous researches, the E value in the scale of 8-16 kJ·mol-1 indicates a chemical immobilization process, nevertheless, the E value\nno more than 8 kJ·mol-1 indicates a physical process. All the E values listed in Table S5-S8 were within the range of 8-16 kJ·mol-1, implying a chemical immobilization process, which is also consistent with Langmuir fitting result."

      "text" : "The influence of temperature on the U(VI) immobilization onto the four adsorbents was investigated at 298, 313 and 333 K with various U (VI) initial concentrations. Fig. 8 illustrated that U(VI) immobilization capability decreased with the rise in the temperature, revealing temperature rise was unfavorable to the immobilization process.\nThe thermodynamic behaviors of adsorption process were characterized through the listed thermodynamic parameters, that is, entropy change (ΔSo, J·mol−1 K−1), enthalpy change (ΔHo, kJ·mol−1), and Gibbs free energy (ΔGo, kJ·mol−1). The values of ΔHo and ΔSo were calculated from the slopes and intercepts of linear regressions of the ln Kd vs 1/T (shown in Figure S9) by the following equation [60,61]:\n=K S R\nH RT ln d o o\n(5)\n=G H T So o o (6)\nwhere Kd is the distribution coefficient (L·g−1). Table 3 showed the thermodynamic parameters calculated from the above equations, illustrating all the negative values of ΔGo under all operating temperatures, certifying that the immobilization process was spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable. Moreover, with increasing operating temperature, the absolute values of ΔGo also suffered an increase, demonstrating an exothermic adsorption process, which was further confirmed by the negative ΔHo values. Moreover, the positive ΔSo\nvalues demonstrates the good affinity of the absorbent towards U(VI) immobilization, indicating this process is entropy-driven."

      "text" : "To get an insight into the immobilization process of U(VI) by MNS-2 at a micro-level, the XPS spectra of MNS-2 with and without U(VI) immobilization (denoted as MNS-2-U) were further analyzed, illustrated in Fig. 9. It can be seen that two distinct characteristic peaks of U 4f appeared in the position of 392.83 and 382.03 eV after U(VI) immobilization, confirming that MNS-2 managed to capture U(VI) from aqueous solution. Furthermore, the XPS high-resolution spectroscopy for O 1 s accompanying with N 1 s peaks was shown in Fig. 10, expecting to reveal the interaction mechanism between U(VI) and MNS-2.\nThe specific functional groups which are responsible for U(VI) immobilization can be determined according to the fitting results of O 1 s and N 1 s spectra [62]. In the high-resolution XPS spectrum for O 1 s shown in Fig. 10a, there are three peaks situating at 532.40, 531.60 and 531.00 eV, belonging to carbon–oxygen (CeO) single bonds, hydroxyl group (−OH) and O2− ions, respectively, shown in Table 4 [63]. However, it can be found that the position of O 1 s peak of −OH groups in MNS-2-U moved toward higher binding energy, nevertheless, the position of O 1 s peak of CeO and O2− did not change, suggesting that the interaction between U(VI) and −OH groups could occur during adsorption process. Fig. 10c and d further displayed the peak fittings of the N 1 s high-resolution spectroscopy of MNS-2 and MNS-2-U, respectively. The N 1 s spectrum deconvoluted into two peaks centered at about 398.75 and 398.42 eV can be attributed to pyrrolic N and C–N (H), respectively. Furthermore, because of the complex reaction of U (VI) and -NH, N 1 s XPS peak of CeN after immobilization of U(VI)\nmoved toward higher binding energy in comparison to that in MNS-2, which was achieved via electron sharing between U(VI) and nitrogen atoms in MNS-2 [61]. Accordingly, it can arrival at a conclusion that the MNS-2 immobilizing U(VI) was fulfilled through the complexation reaction between the absorbed U(VI) and functional groups situated on the surface of MNS-2 (i.e. C–N(H) and −OH groups). To further verify whether the absorbed U(VI) destroy the coordination bonds within the MNS-2 framework, both XRD pattern and FT-IR spectrum of MNS-2 after U(VI) immobilization have been carried out. As illustrated in Figure S10, the XRD pattern of MNS-2-U (MNS-2 with U(VI) immobilization) displayed no significant changes in comparison to raw MNS-2, suggesting that MNS-2 could maintain its high structural stability after U(VI) immobilization. Moreover, the FT-IR spectrum of MNS-2-U clearly exhibited the Cu–N stretching vibration at 432 cm−1, further confirming its high structural stability. Furthermore, both −OH and NeH stretching vibration displayed hypsochromic shifts, suggesting their complexation reaction with U(VI), which is consistent with the result of XPS analysis. In addition, no antisymmetric vibration of the [O]U]O]2+ group could be obtained at∼963 cm−1 [64], which may\nbe attributed to the low U(VI) concentration in aqueous solution or the compression effect of in-plane bending of the imidazole ring in the region of 900 and 1350 cm−1."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "This study proposed a one-step, and cost-effective route for the successful preparation of thin 2D MOFs nano-sheets (MNSs) through\ncomplexation between MeimiH and Cu(II) at ambient temperature. The obtained materials were fully characterized with freestanding, microsized lateral dimensions and nanoscale thickness. The effect of solvent ratios to the morphology change was observed and can be ascribed to solvent acidity and viscosity. The comparison on immobilization performance with other MOFs materials demonstrates that obtained MNS samples have better immobilization performance for U(VI) removal. Several thermodynamic parameters were evaluated, indicating the exothermic and spontaneous nature of U(VI) immobilization. The U(VI) immobilization mechanism was fulfilled by the complexation reaction between U(VI) and functional groups in MNS-2 (i.e. C–N(H)/−OH groups). This as-prepared 2D MOFs nano-sheets allow for the highly efficient immobilization of U(VI), accompanying with a facile and purposeful approach for its fabrication. And it can be anticipated that metal ions and N-containing ligands in this complexation could be applied to yield a variety of MOFs with great abilities to immobilize U (VI) from aqueous mediums."
