      "text" : "Nano-composite polymer blend electrolytes (NCPBEs) have generated great interest in\ndeveloping new materials because of their potential application in the fabrication of electrochemical devices such as batteries, super capacitors, fuel cell etc [1, 2]. The uses of solid polymer electrolytes based on alkali metal salts have certain limitations such as low ionic conductivity at room temperature, low mechanical flexibility and poor chemical stability [3-5]. Several methods have been incorporated for improving these properties such as cross-linking, polymer blending [6, 7], use of nano-fillers [8] and plasticizers [9]. In these methods, though polymer blending is cost-effective but this method has drawn much attention for improving the matrix properties due to interactions between the functional groups of polymers via hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions [6]. Poly (vinyl) alcohol (PVA) containing hydroxyl (O-H) is a semi-crystalline polymer, studied enormously because of their many important physical and chemical properties such as high dielectric constant, water solubility, good charge storage capacity and dopant dependent electrical, dielectric and optical properties [10]. Water solvable polymer, poly(vinyl) pyrrolidone (PVP) also have a special attention among the conjugated polymers because of its good environmental stability, easy processability and amorphousness which support easy charge transportation [11-13]. The interactions between PVP-PVA were taken place via inter-chain hydrogen bonding between carbonyl group (C=O) of PVP and hydroxyl group (O-H) of PVA [14]. Addition of nano-fillers in polymer matrices has been found to be an effective method of enhancing the ionic conductivity of polymer material for higher thermal and mechanical stability which are additional requirements of solid polymer electrolytes for a wide range of electrochemical applications [15, 16]. Nano-fillers provide a better ion conductive pathway by enhancing the surface area to volume ratio in the polymer\nmatrices [17-19]. The enhancement of conductivity in the nano-composite polymer electrolytes has been described by two factors, first is the large specific surface area provided by the nano-particles (at nano scale) and second is the interactions that occur between the surface groups of the nano-particles and the polymer matrix [20-22]. The addition of nano-particles creates disorder in the polymer matrix which is directly associated with bulk ionic conductivity [23]. The nano-composite polymer films show the better electrochemical stability towards a metal anode and also enhanced cation transport number [24-26]. The ion conduction mechanism in these polymer electrolytes has not been studied so for and our interest regarding the study of ion-dynamics behavior of such systems are of the fundamental importance. A systematic study for understanding the role of nano-particles in modifying the electrical and dielectric properties of NCPBEs will provide an opportunity to develop new ideas in this field. In the present work we have studied the loading effect of SiO2, nano-particles on the ac conductivity behavior, dielectric properties, mobility and total number of charge carries of PVA-PVP-NaI based NCPBE using AC impedance spectroscopic technique. 2. Materials and experimental details\nPVA having average molecular weight ~ 1,25,000 g/mol with purity >98% and degree of\nhydrolysis ~89%, PVP with average molecular weight ~ 44,000 g/mol with purity >99% and salt, sodium iodide (NaI) salt were procured from Merck, Germany. SiO2 nano-particles having average particle size 14nm with surface area 20025m2/g was purchased from Sigma Aldrich.\nDeionized distilled water was used as a solvent for the preparation of PVA-PVP-NaI-SiO2 based polymeric films.\nThe NCPBEs have been prepared using solution casting technique. In this technique the\ndesired wt% ratio of materials [(50PVA-50PVP):30NaI]: xwt%SiO2 with x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6,\n0.8, 1.0 were mixed separately in solvent and the mixture was kept in oven at 50 oC for 24 hrs to swell, after that the solution is stirrer continuously for 5 hrs to obtained the viscous slurry. The viscous slurry was purred on poly propylene Petri-dishes and put into the oven at 40 oC for 10 days in order to evaporation of solvent, after that free standing films having thickness of ~50-90 µm were obtained. All the prepared films were kept in evacuated desiccators for further measurements. The prepared polymeric films were characterized using AC impedance spectroscopic technique in the frequency range 20Hz-1MHz by using high precision Wayne Kerr impedance analyzer 6500 B with bias voltage 100mV. 3.

      "heading" : "3.1 AC conductivity analysis",
      "text" : "Frequency dependent ac conductivity formalism has been used to explore the ion\ndynamics behaviour of various polymer electrolytes [10, 13, 27]. For polymer electrolytes it is expected that ac conductivity curves follows the Jonscher’s Power law (JPL) (σac = σdc+Afn), where the exponent n is restricted to be less than one for different frequency range, A is the\ntemperature dependent parameter, dc is the dc/bulk conductivity and f is the frequency. The ion motion passes from free hopping (n=0) to correlated hopping (0<n<1) [28] followed by caged movement of ions greater than one (n>1), [29]. Figs. 1 (A) & (B) show the ac conductivity spectra of PVA-PVP-NaI-xwt%SiO2 (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) at ambient temperature (30oC) and for PVA-PVP-NaI-0.6 wt%SiO2 at different temperatures, respectively. It is observed that the ac conductivity spectra of NCPBEs mainly consists two regions (Fig. 1(A)). The first region is frequency independent plateau region assigned to the bulk conductivity of the sample.\nThe bulk ionic conductivity (dc) of the samples was obtained from extrapolation of plateau region to the Y-axis. The second region is high frequency region in which conductivity increases\nwith frequency (ac=Afn). It is found that 0.6 wt%SiO2, sample consist of three regions indicating low, mid and high frequency region. In the low frequency region, conductivity decreases with\nincreasing frequency due to polarization effect. The values of dc, A and n for all NCPBE based polymeric films at 30oC were obtained from fitted ac conductivity spectra and are listed in Table\n1. From Table 1 it has been found that dc conductivity, dc varies with SiO2 concentration with n>1 support the caged type movement of ions. Polymer blending also enhances the flexibility of polymer chains creates large free volume which facilitates the translational motion of free ions, hence an increase in the ion mobility [30]. The maximum conductivity was found to be 5.07x10-6 S/cm at 30oC for PVA-PVP-30NaI-0.6 wt% SiO2 system. Fig. 1 (B) shows the fitted ac conductivity spectra of 0.6 wt% SiO2 based polymer blend electrolyte at different temperatures and it is found that the value of n decreases with increasing temperature (inset Fig. 1(B)). In the low frequency region conductivity decreases with frequency and there is upward shifting of plateau region with temperature due to increase in the bulk ionic conductivity."

      "text" : "based NCPBE samples. It shows Arrhenius type thermally activated behaviour (ion dynamics associated with thermal activation energy) expressed as: \uD835\uDC7B = \uD835\uDC85\uD835\uDC84\uD835\uDC1E\uD835\uDC31\uD835\uDC29 ( ― \uD835\uDC6C\uD835\uDC82\uD835\uDC8C\uD835\uDC7B ) where σdc is the dc conductivity (obtained from ac conductivity spectra), Ea is the activation energy in eV, k is Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in K. Arrhenius type behavior indicate that ion transport via hopping mechanism decoupled from polymer chain breathing. From the plots, it is evident that as the temperature increases the bulk ionic conductivity σdc increases for all the NCPBEs. From Fig. 2 it is also observed that log σdc vs. 1000/T plots consists of two regions one below and the other above the glass transition\ntemperature (Tg) of PVA-PVP polymer blend [31]. It is found that the activation energy, Ea2 is quite low above Tg in comparison to the activation energy, Ea1 below Tg (data are listed in Table 2). Sample containing 0.6wt% of SiO2 shows minimum activation energy 0.79 eV possibly due to interaction between functional groups of blend polymers, PVA/PVP with the electron loan pairs of oxygen SiO2 and the cations of sodium salt, Na+ (Lewis acid). The Lewis acid interacts with the base of electrolytes and increases the salt dissociation by the ionic coupling and ion-filler complexation [32].The increase in dc conductivity with temperature may be due to the increased chain flexibility which is associated with long range ion migration through coordinating sites of polymer matrix (segmental motion of polymer chains) [33]. The correlation between segmental mobility and ion transport can be explained on the basis of the free volume model [34] and hopping of charge carriers between localized states [35]."

Fig. 3(A) shows that the variation of tanδ with frequency, for NCPBEs at different wt% of SiO2. It is observed that tanδ peaks were shifted towards the higher frequency region with the addition of SiO2 nano-particles and it is optimum for 0.6wt% SiO2 sample due to fast segmental motion of polymer chains of NCPBEs [36] and tan decreases in high frequency\nregion. The peaks observed in tanδ vs. frequency plots reveal the matching of the relaxation frequency of polymer chains/dipole orientation with the frequency of applied external electric field. Fig. 3 (B) shows the variation of relaxation time, with SiO2 τ concentration in prepared NCPBEs. It has been observed that the relaxation time, is minimum τ for 0.6wt% SiO2 sample shown in Fig. 3(B). 3.4. Complex dielectric permittivity study\nStudy of complex dielectric permittivity (ε*) is an important tool for understanding the\nelectrode polarization effect and energy dissipation in terms of dielectric constant ( and \uD835\uDF00') dielectric loss ( , respectively of ion conducting materials. It is given by the equation:\uD835\uDF00\")\n\uD835\uDF00 ∗ = \uD835\uDF00∞ + \uD835\uDF001\n1 + \uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDF14\uD835\uDF0F\nWhere , εo is the dielectric constant at low frequency, ε∞ is the dielectric constant at \uD835\uDF001 = ɛ\uD835\uDC5C ― \uD835\uDF00∞ very high frequency (ω  ) , i2 = −1 and τ is the relaxation time. Real and imaginary parts of\nthe dielectric permittivity are expressed as:\nAnd . \uD835\uDF00' = \uD835\uDF00∞ + \uD835\uDF001\n1 + \uD835\uDF142\uD835\uDF0F2 \uD835\uDF00 ″ =\n\uD835\uDF001\uD835\uDF14\uD835\uDF0F\n1 + \uD835\uDF142\uD835\uDF0F2\nThus the value of changes from 0 to  and hence the dielectric constant varies from to , ωτ ɛ\uD835\uDC5C ε∞ i.e. decreases due to blockage of ion migration or ion diffusion [37, 38]. Figs. 4 (A-B) show\nthe variation of ε′ and ε″ with frequency at different concentration of silica nano-particles for PVA-PVP-NaI-SiO2 based NCPBEs and Figs. 4 (C-D) at different temperatures for PVA-PVPNaI-0.6 wt% SiO2, respectively. It has been observed that in Figs. 4 the values of ε′ and ε″ are high in low frequency region because of space charge polarization near the electrode electrolyte interface [39, 40]. With increasing the concentration of silica nano-particles in PVA-PVP-NaI polymer matrix there is an increase of localization of charge carriers near the electrode\nelectrolyte interfaces hence an increase in ε′ and ε″ values, respectively. Dielectric loss ()\nspectra for 0.6wt% SiO2 based NCPBE consists single relaxation peak associated with the dielectric relaxation of polymer blend. At the higher frequency, changing of applied field direction has been rapid periodic reversal that create a negative environment for dipole alignment, so that ion diffusion stop in the direction of field and hence ε′ and ε″ both decreases with increasing frequency for all PVA-PVP-NaI-SiO2 based NCPBEs [41]. 3.5. Variation of ε′ and ε″ with temperature and SiO2 concentration\nThe variation of ε′ and ε″ with temperature at different frequencies for PVA-PVP-NaI-0.6\nwt%SiO2 and the variation of ε′ and ε″ with silica nano-particles (SiO2) at different frequencies are shown in Figs. 5 (A-B) and Figs. 5 (C-D), respectively. It is observed that in Fig. 5 (A) the values of ε′ increases with temperature exponentially and decreases with frequency. The values of ε″ for 0.6wt%SiO2 containing sample increases exponentially with temperature as well as frequency (Fig. 5 (B)). This is because of re-orientation of dipoles (functional groups of PVA and PVP) attached with the chains of polymer/polymer blend [42]. The values of ε′ and ε″ are optimum near 0.6 wt%SiO2 nano-particles loading in the PVA-PVA-NaI based sample and their values decreases with frequency (Figs. 5 (C-D)). With the loading of SiO2 in PVA-PVP-NaI based films, the  is optimum for 0.6wt% containing sample, because of weak interactions\nbetween loan pair of electrons of oxygen of SiO2 with the functional groups of PVA-PVP polymer blend. The high values of permittivity indicates the enhancement in ionic\nconductivity expressed as dc=Nq where N, q and  are the total number of charge carrier density, electric charge and mobility, respectively. 3.6. Electric modulus studies\nIon transport mechanism of prepared NCPBEs was further explored by using electric\nmodulus formalism [43]. The complex electric modulus (M*) is the inverse of the complex dielectric permittivity (ε*) and can be expressed as:\n\uD835\uDC40 ∗ () = 1  ∗ () = \uD835\uDC40' + \uD835\uDC57\uD835\uDC40\" = \n'\n'2 + \"2 + \uD835\uDC57\n\"\n'2 + \"2\nwhere M′ and M″ are the real and imaginary parts of the complex electric modulus M*(ω) in terms of ε′ and ε″ . The frequency dependence of M′ and M″ spectra at different wt% of SiO2 for PVA-PVP-NaI-SiO2 based NCPBEs is shown in Figs. 6(A-B). Similarly, frequency dependent variation of M′ and M″ at different temperatures for highest conducting NCPBEs i.e. 0.6 wt% of SiO2 are shown in Figs. 6(C-D). It is observed that the electric modulus in low frequency region is approaching to zero due to negligible contribution of electrode polarization. The value of M′ and M″ as a function of frequency at ambient temperature for NCPBEs dispersed with different wt% of SiO2, suggests that large capacitance is associated with the electrodes and confirms the non-Debye behavior. At high frequencies the value of M′ and M″ increases with increasing frequency. It is also observed that with increasing the temperature the value of M′ and M″ decreases due to increase in mobility of charge carriers with temperature. The value of M′ and M″ shows some relaxation peak which shifts towards higher frequency with increasing temperature because of faster ionic motion, leading to decrease in relaxation time. Thus the charge carriers are thermally activated. From Figs. 6 (A-B) it is also observed that M′ and M″ vs.\nfrequency spectra are much broader than what is expected for the ideal Debye type and show the asymmetricity and skewed towards the high frequency. Such a broad nature of peak is an indication of the non-Debye type relaxation. 3.7. Variation of dc (Scm-1), N (m-3) and  (m2V-1s-1) with silica nano-particles\nThe ion diffusivity (D),  and N can be obtained by analyzing the dielectric and ac\nconductivity spectra. D can be estimated by using the relation: here is \uD835\uDC37 = 2\uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC592\n32(\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDEFF\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65)3 w \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDEFF\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65\nthe maximum value of , is the frequency at which is maximum and l is the \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDEFF \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65 \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDEFF thickness of film [44]. By knowing the value of D (obtained from Fig. 3(A)) and (obtained \uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC50 from fitted ac conductivity spectra) N could be calculated using the Einstein equation: \uD835\uDC41 = \uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC58\uD835\uDC47\n\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC5E2\nwhere k is the Boltzmann’s constant, T is the absolute temperature and q is the elementary charge. The μ can also be calculated from the relation: . The value of ion diffusivity varies \uD835\uDF07 = \uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC50 \uD835\uDC5E\uD835\uDC41 from 5.99x10-8 to 3.68x10-7. The value of total number of charge carriers varies from 2.18x1021 to 1.84x1017. The mobility is varied from 2.29x10-6 to 1.41x10-5 with the increasing concentration of SiO2. The value of N (~ 6.98x10-21 m-3) and  (~ 4.60x10-7 m2V-1s-1) is optimum for PVA-PVP-NaI-0.6wt%SiO2 based NCPBE film."

    "abstractText" : "In this paper we have reported the loading effect of SiO2 nano-particles on the electrical transport properties and dielectric relaxation behavior of the PVA-PVP-NaI based nano composite polymer blend electrolytes (NCPBEs). Solution cast technique has been used for the preparation of PVA-PVP-NaI-SiO2 based NCPBE films. AC impedance spectroscopic technique is used for the study of electrical conductivity and dielectric properties. The frequency dependence of AC conductivity with different SiO2 concentration for all prepared NCPBEs obeys the Jonscher power law (JPL) with exponent, n1. The dielectric permittivity (ε′&ε′′), electric modulus (M′&M′′) vs. frequency plots at different concentrations and temperatures were reported. Mobility (), dc conductivity (dc) and total number of charge carriers (N) were estimated and found that mobility varies with the SiO2 concentration. Sample containing 0.6wt% of SiO2 shows optimum dc conductivity, dc ~ 5.07x10-6 S/cm with  ~ 4.60x10-7 and N ~ 6.98x1021. Dielectric relaxation peaks have been observed for all samples and relaxation time () is minimum for 0.6wt%SiO2 based NCPBE film. Keywords;",
