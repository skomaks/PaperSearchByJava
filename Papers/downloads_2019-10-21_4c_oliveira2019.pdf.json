Although environmental awareness continues to grow, so does its consumption and associated risks. The number of studies reporting the presence of microplastics, has grown exponentially as did the concern over plastic degradation into smaller particles like nanoplastics, a potentially more pernicious form of plastic pollution. The reported effects of micro(nano) plastics on biota range from depletion of energy reserves and altered metabolism to immunological, neurotoxic effects and behavioral effects. This paper presents a critical review of current scientific knowledge in terms of reasons to study the effects of small plastics present in the environment, what has been assessed so far; most common methodologies. Research and technical developments requirements are also presented. Overall, it is clear the need for standardization of procedures and communication of results.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Over the last 50 years the use of plastics allowed a considerable improvement of human everyday lives [1]. Routinely used in simple daily requirements (e.g. fresh food requirements, transport of shopping goods, aseptic medical products, preparation of meals), plastics may be considered a pillar material in a global “throwaway culture” economy. Plastics allowed the use of more cost effective, light weight products and production of materials with characteristics required for a wide range of human needs. Among the life quality improvements that may be attributed to the use of plastics, food packaging allows the reduction of wastage and food borne bacterial infections. As world plastics production continues to experience an increase (approximately 335 million tons in 2016 [2]), plastics are, deliberately and/or accidental, being released into the environment, having been found even in remote areas like Antarctica [3], mountain-tops [4] and deep ocean [5], becoming available for ingestion to a wide range of organisms (e.g. zooplankton, bivalves, shrimps, lugworms, fishes and whales). Thus, the entire planet may be under pressure by the presence of plastic particles. Nevertheless, the overall level of environmental contamination remains largely unknown. There is the need to\n.\nquantify the environmental contamination by plastic particles, their ecological effects and overall risk to the environment and ultimately, human health. This is, however, a difficult task, complicated by several factors associated with plastics intrinsic properties (e.g. nature: different polymers with distinct additives and potential for sorption of environmental contaminants; size: original and of entry in the environment), sources (ranging from wastewater treatment plants, to open air dumpsites), dispersion potential and fragmentation into increasingly smaller particles. A realistic risk assessment requires data of abundance, size distribution and chemical composition of microplastics [6]. This paper aims to present a critical discussion of the facts that make plastics a potential environmental risk and the methodologies currently available to quantify, characterize and test effects."

      "heading" : "2. Plastics in the environment",
      "text" : "Understanding the global mass inventory is one of the main challenges in present research on plastic marine debris [7]. The plastic particles found in the environment differ in terms of source (via different pathways associated with land and marine-based activities), size (macro, meso, micro and nano), density (16e2200 kg m 3), chemical composition, and shape (e.g. spheres, fibre, film, irregular) [8]. Land-based sources are considered the most important, including industrial and domestic drainage systems, wastewater treatment effluents, storm sewers, wind, water\nsystems currents and run off soils from agricultural practices like plastic mulching or treated with sewage sludge, often used as fertilizer. The use of polymers (e.g. polystyrene and polyurethane), added to compost to improve soil properties and increase crop yields may also be considered as a recognized source of micro(nano)plastics in the environment [9]. Themarine-based sources are associated with transportation of products, recreational cruises, extraction of oil, illegal dumping, and fishing activities. Regardless of the sources, contamination by plastics is putting the environment under a considerable pressure, particularly oceans, the ultimate recipient of most environmental contaminants, adding to other pressures like ocean acidification and temperature rise.\nDespite the recognition of the potential of soils to retain and accumulate plastic particles, there is limited knowledge in terms of micro(nano)plastics levels in this environmental compartment. It has been estimated that between 63 000 and 430 000 tons of microplastics are annually added, to European farmlands, via sewage sludge [10]. However, plastics have also been found in agricultural soils, not subjected to microplastic-containing fertilizers (e.g. sewage sludge and organic fertilizers) nor agricultural plastic applications (e.g. 0.34 microplastic particles per kilogram dry weight of soil) [11].\nAlthough the problem of the presence of small plastic particles in the environment has only recently attracted public awareness, the first reports in coastal areas and oceans, dates from the 1970's [12]. Plastic characteristics like resistance, durability, that support its use in awide range of industrial applications, are also reasons for environmental concerns and a challenge for remediation, as the particles already present in the environment may persist for centuries [13]. Additionally, it is now recognized that plastics may suffer multiple degradation and disintegration procedures, via biotic and/or abiotic processes, that lead to the formation of smallersized plastics, such as microplastics (<5 mm) and nanoplastics (defined as < 1000 nm according to some authors or < 100 nm according to others [14,15]), making their removal increasingly harder. The physical process involved in plastic degradation is more favoured in beaches, subjected to high UV radiation, physical abrasion induced by waves and high oxygen availability. At some locations, microplastics can constitute over 80% of intertidal plastic debris [16]. Micro(nano)plastics are also used in several products like personal care products (e.g. facial cleansers, tooth paste, shower/bath gels, scrubs, peelings, makeup, insect repellents and sunscreen), abrasives in cleaning products, and biomedical applications that have, as end destination, their release into sewage systems and/or environment. Although it is known that nanoplastics are being released and transported through air, soil, and water compartments [17], the available data concerning its presence, variation of characteristics and impacts on natural systems is extremely scarce, largely due to the difficulty of its detection and characterization. Nonetheless, its levels are expected to increase consistently over time in the environment.\nIn the aquatic environment, in addition to characteristics like resistance and durability, the distribution of plastics is modulated by characteristics like its buoyancy. In seawater, particles with higher density tend to sink and accumulate in sediments, becoming more available to benthic organisms. The less dense particles may remain at sea surface until biofouling processes by biota or entrainment in biological aggregates (including faecal pellets after ingestion) occur, leading to increased densities and their sinking [18], or be degraded into smaller particles. At the nanometer size, many physicochemical (e.g. surface charge, coating) may be altered by variations in the surrounding media (e.g. salinity, pH) and lead to changes in size (agglomeration/aggregation processes) and/or hydrophobicity, thus influencing its distribution in the water column.\nUltimately, marine sediments may be considered long-term sinks for micro(nano)plastics.\nThe available information in terms of the levels of plastics found in the aquatic environment vary, with most studies quantifying particles in the marine systems. Examples of levels reported in freshwater and marine systems are presented in Table SI1. The available data may, however, be underestimating contamination as environmental sampling frequently resorts to 300 mm nets mesh. A clear example is presented in Table SI1, where abundance of microplastics sampled using a 330 mm net mesh is considerably lower than using an 80 mm mesh (0.45 versus 106 particles/m3).\nThe assessment of the potential consequences of the presence of micro(nano)plastics on the environment should also account for its role on the dispersion of environmental contaminants from places with high concentrations to areas of low concentrations, acting as a dispersion agent. Their large surface area to volume ratio endow them a high association potential for environmental contaminants [19] although different polymers have shown different sorption capacities. Microplastics are able to concentrate environmental contaminants [20], increasing the concern on their associated environmental hazard."

      "heading" : "3. Interaction of micro(nano)plastics with biota",
      "text" : "The widespread use of plastic materials and their dispersion in the environment create a decentralized environmental risk [21]. An increasing number of studies are trying to understand the effects of plastics to biota, mainly in estuarine/marine environments, expected to be the ultimate sink of microplastics. However, the establishment of cause-effect linkages of risks associated with environmental microplastics is difficult, leading to great uncertainty in their scientific assessment [21].\nRecently published reviews summarized the available studies on microplastic presence, behavior and effects on aquatic [2] and soil [22] organisms. Significant mismatches between the types of microplastics most commonly found in the environment and those used in laboratory experiments has been highlighted [2]. Overall, available studies demonstrated that microplastics may be ingested by different marine organisms from zooplankton to fish. Fish and crustacea are the most studied groups, followed by molluscs and annelid worms but there are very few studies with other groups of organisms. In organisms like fish, ingestion has been associated with confusing plastic particles with preys. Reported levels in field sampled organisms show that the number of plastic vary considerably (e.g. 0.03 particles/fish were found in animals caught in the North Baltic sea whereas 21.8 particles/fish were reported in fish from the Persian Gulf, Table SI2). Data from feeding experiments with zooplankton show that plastic particles ingestion depends on factors like size, abundance and deposition in the environment, predator's feeding mode and anatomy of feeding/digestive organs [23]. The levels found in zooplankton from Northeast Pacific Ocean are in the same range of fish in the North Baltic Sea (0.02 particles/copepod and 0.05 particles/euphausiids, Table SI2). There is, however, a need for standardization of the units expressing microplastics content in biota to allow comparison between studies (e.g. levels have been expressed as particles per gram of dry weight or particles per animal). For laboratory studies, the concentrations of micro(nano)plastics and how they are expressed is also very important. The same unity of mass may represent huge different in terms of number of particles available to the organisms.\nA decrease in particle size leads to an increased number of organisms able ingest them (Fig. 1), as well as in the processes of leaching of chemicals, desorption of additives and adsorption of\nenvironmental contaminants [24]. At a nano size, additional pathways of incorporation in biota (e.g. through gills and skin) are possible, increasing the number potential target tissues. Microplastics, at high concentrations, have shown the ability affect the base of a trophic web Microplastics have the ability to negatively influence microalgae growth [25] and photosynthesis [26], and zooplankton feeding and reproduction [27]. At a higher trophic level, in fish, they can affect neurotransmission [28] and behavior [29]. In benthic organisms, reduced feeding activity, decreased energy reserves, inflammation [30] and body weight decrease have also reported [31]. Available data from laboratory studies suggest that particles incorporated by organisms in a lower trophic level (e.g. zooplankton, mussels) may be passed up the food web [32,33], and be a vector for the transfer of environmental contaminants that may eventually reach the humans.\nHumans may be exposed to micro(nano)plastics through different sources (e.g. contaminated food, sea salt, airborne particles, personal care products). The ability of organisms like mussels, oysters, clams and prawns to incorporate microplastics (Table SI2) may have serious consequences to man as these organisms, unlike most fish species, are consumed as a whole. However, the potential for micro(nano)plastics of environmental origin to cause harm to human health remains understudied [1]. Data concerning translocation events of micro(nano)plastics across biological compartments together with known effects in neurotransmission in aquatic organisms emphasize the need of studies on the effects of micro(nano)plastics to humans.\nThe behavior of nanoparticles, their fate and effects once internalized by cells is a key factor influencing cytotoxicity which may not only dependent on the nature of the core material but also on surface modifications (e.g. hydrophobicity, charge, functional groups and size [34e36]). As for other\nnanoparticles, surface charge, size, agglomeration and aggregation of polystyrene nanoplastics are altered in environmental media [37], which can thus alter its biological effects. Although the effects of nanoplastics on marine organisms are poorly studied, recent studies have shown that polystyrene nanoparticles can induce neurotoxic and genotoxic effects and interact with pharmaceuticals effects [38]. High levels of polystyrene micro and nanoplastics have been reported to induced mortality in zooplanktonic organisms like the marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus [27]. In addition to the potential pernicious effects of the particles by themselves, the fact that they are present in environments contaminated with substances reported to adsorb onto surface of plastic particles (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals, some of which known carcinogens, and/or endocrine disrupters) and the ability of micro(nano)particles to modify distribution, biotransformation and effects of other environmental contaminants (e.g. PAHs and pharmaceuticals) upon simultaneous exposure [28,38] motivate research on the ability of micro(nano)plastics to act as transport vectors for environmental contaminants [17,28,38]. These effects should take into consideration processes like plastic aging/weathering, that may increase surface area and polarity [39,40].\nAn important aspect in the study of the consequences of the presence of micro(nano)plastics in the environment is the link cause/effect response. If laboratorial assays allow such studies, in the environment several factors may contribute to effects to biota, from the particle itself, release of additives and chemicals used in their synthesis, background contamination of plastics and presence of pathogenic organisms. It is difficult to assess the risk of environmental “contaminated plastics” due to the difficulty of knowing all associated chemicals."

      "heading" : "4. Methodologies to quantify and assess the effects of micro(nano)plastics",
      "text" : "Research on micro(nano)plastics may be considered in early stages. Fate and effects are frequently assessed using different approaches and exposure scenarios, oftenwith limited environmental relevance [2,41,42] (e.g., using extremely high concentrations and/ or other non-environmentally relevant conditions). Considering that there are a high number of variables that maymodulate effects of micro(nano)plastics, there is the need to standardize methodologies/approaches to assess effects using, whenever possible, also environmentally relevant conditions. This aspect is even more important for nanoparticles as mobility, fate, and bioavailability depend on their characteristics such as size, shape, charge, and other properties [38,43], modulated by the surrounding media. Studies of metallic nanoparticles behavior in artificial seawater revealed that the time nanoparticles took to aggregate, decreased with increased particles concentration, an expected output because the probability of nanoparticles collisions, at a given temperature, will increase with increasing number of particles per volume [43]. In this perspective, a complete characterization of micro(nano) plastics is determinant to truly understand their distribution in the water column as well as their potential pernicious effects. However, little is known about the fate and behavior of synthetic nanomaterials in the environment, and appropriate methods to detect them in complex environmental media are not yet available [44].\n4.1. Quantification and identification\nAn accurate assessment of the consequences of the presence of micro(nano)plastics in the environment requires the knowledge of its abundance, size distribution and chemical composition. However, despite the efforts to establish effective analytical procedures, detection of nanoplastic in environmental substrates is not yet possible [9,45].\nOne of the first challenges in the quantification of micro(nano) plastics in the environment is the sampling procedure. In the marine environment, the approaches vary according to the position in the water column. Manta or neuston nets are frequently used in surface waters, bongo nets on mid-water levels and benthic trawls usually used for seabed (Table SI1). The most commonly used nets have a mesh size approximately of 300 mm [7], which compromises the possibility to quantify and identify the smaller fractions and leads to an underestimation of the content in aquatic environments.\nFor soils, adopted approaches include grounding and sieving (which, to allow comparison with results obtained in sediments andwater, should use sieves withmesh <5mm). Themineral phase of soils may be removed by density fractionation methods, also used for sediment analysis. However, for soils, procedures to remove organic moieties must be optimized to remove inference of soil organic matter in the detection methods [46].\nIn biological matrices, quantification of microplastics required extraction and degradation of biogenic matter, detection of the particles, characterization and quantification. The removal of organic material in the samples can be achieved through degradation or digestion (e.g. degradation with H2O2 (30%); KOH (10%); HNO3 (22.5 M); mixture of HNO3 and HClO4), methods that present different efficiencies as well potential to damage polymers. Thus, there is the need to standardize procedures that do not compromise the integrity of plastics, in order to accurately estimate of microplastics content (number of particles, size and type) in biological materials [23]. In this perspective, enzymatic digestion of biogenic material has been proposed as an effective approach that avoids damage to plastic polymers [47], although this process\nrequires specialized equipment, sample desiccation and grinding [23].\nThe visual examination of the isolated microplastics is frequently performed to sort microplastics from other materials. The use of optical microscope, that allows visualization in the low micrometer range (Fig. 1) and the use of Nile red, a fluorescent dye that selectively stains most synthetic polymers (except rubber), using a UVwavelength that induces green fluorescence [48], allows optimization of the isolation procedure for posterior identification of the polymer types. The identification of plastics may be achieved through different processes but Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Raman techniques are among the most used methodologies, as they do not destruct the material, require low amount of sample and allow the possibility for high throughput screening. Furthermore, they may be considered more environmentally friendly than other techniques like differential scanning calorimetry and pyrolysisegas chromatographyemass spectrometry. Compared to FTIR, Raman techniques show better spatial resolution (down to 1 mm versus 1e20 of FTIR), wider spectral coverage, higher sensitivity to non-polar functional groups and lower water interference and narrower spectral bands [6] but the proneness to fluorescence interference and requirement of long measurement time are technical handicaps. Raman is effective in the identification of polymers but may not be as sensitive as FTIR when studying polymer degradation. The processes of degradation and weathering of plastics may cause variation in the spectroscopic spectra of polymers making identification more difficult.\nFor nanoplastics, size-based discrimination may be achieved by ultrafiltration or other separation methods like flow field fractionation and hydrodynamic chromatography. Nanoparticle tracking analysis [14], dynamic light scattering (which may also give information of surface charge) [38] and electron/super resolution microscopy may be used as techniques to assess size. Techniques like scanning electronmicroscopy with energy dispersive Xray spectrometry and flow field fractionation coupled tomultiangle light scattering with pyrolysis have also been reported [49]. Combination of atomic force microscopy, super-resolution and infrared spectroscopy (SRS/CARS) has also been proposed to characterize material at the nanoscale (Fig. 1) [50].\nAlthough identification and quantification of micro(nano) plastics on biota are extremely important, the analysis of data of plastic particles on organisms caught in the environment has to be carefully examined, as laboratory studies suggest that the absolute number of ingested microplastics may not accurately reflect the level of microplastics in seawater, as a consequence of possible biodilution [23], in which microplastics become less available due to competition with a growing number of individuals."

      "heading" : "4.2. Methodologies to assess effects of Micro(nano)plastics?",
      "text" : "The selection of the most adequate approach to test the effects of environmental contaminants like micro(nano)plastics is dependent on several aspects of the research (e.g. research question and degree of information required, and model species selected for the study). Biological effects of micro(nano)plastics may be assessed using in vivo studies, which involve exposure an organism as a whole, and allow assessment of lethality, effects on behavior, feeding, bioaccumulation, depuration, trophic transfer, and biochemical, physiological and histopathological responses. The assessment of effects on fish embryos is gaining increasing importance in the field of ecotoxicology, having been proposed as an alternative to adult in vivo tests. Among the different approaches that may be used to assess the effects of micro(nano)plastics is behavior, which may be considered the outcome or endpoint of many complex developmental and physiological processes.\nHowever, few studies are addressing effects on these endpoints or mainly focusing on feeding impairment despite effects on behavior parameters like movement and avoidance may have ecological consequences (e.g., altering prey-predator relationship and decreasing competitive advantages). In vitro methodologies like primary cell culture and cell lines, allow the study of particular mechanisms of action, although data from these methodologies do not provide information on the feedback systems involved in regulation of organismal responses to environmental stress. Cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, distribution within a cell and molecular responses like expression of genes involved in a metabolic pathway may be assessed using in vitro systems. These methods are ethically recommended, whenever they can be used to replace animal experimentation, with the advantage of allowing a high throughput approach to investigate specific modes of action and speciesspecific responses (e.g. fish and humans).\nMolecular endpoints are considered sensitive and efficient tools to detect effects of xenobiotics and can be assessed in in vivo and in vitro studies. They are used based on the principle that changes at a molecular level occur prior to manifestations at higher levels of biological organization (e.g. reproduction, behavior) and on the information that they may provide in terms of mechanisms of action (through the analysis of genomic modifications; transcription of genetic information to mRNA; translation to proteins synthesis; and metabolic products). Molecular endpoints may be used in a first approach to rank the toxic effects of different micro(nano) plastics. However, despite the sensitivity of these endpoints, complex regulatory mechanisms in the organism as awhole, may result in the lack of effects at higher levels of organization. Thus, effects at higher levels of organization (e.g. behavior) should be also assessed."

      "heading" : "5. Research needs",
      "text" : "There is an increased need of development of analytical methods for micro (nano)plastics and their standardization to allow detection, identification of polymers and quantification in environmental matrices. This applies not only to water and sediments but other matrices like biological media as well as food items. The knowledge on how plastic particles of different polymers are distributed in the water column and the role of abiotic conditions on their environmental distribution, behavior and bioavailability is poorly known and should be studied. Limited information is also available in terms of nanoplastics, particularly in terms of potential for formation of different polymers, under environmentally relevant conditions, their stability/aggregation and deposition.\nSoils are being neglected in terms of microplastics research (e.g. their effects to soil organisms and degradation), despite the recognition of soils potential to retain and accumulate plastic particles, and the use of plastics in agricultural. Although some laboratorial studies are available, there is no field data [22]. It is, thus, imperative to develop this aspect of microplastic research.\nIn terms of biological effects, plastic age-related effects should be studied considering that weathering processes alter the structure of the particles, their structural consistency, ability to release chemicals used in their synthesis and to adsorb environmental contaminants. Despite the technical challenges, studies with nanoplastics should be performed to establish the role of size on biological effects, bioaccumulation, trophic transfer and trojan horse effect. This is particularly important considering the size dependent effects reported for other types of nanoparticles in laboratory studies. Pathways of incorporation and distribution of particles once incorporated by organisms should be studied (e.g. using fluorescent labelled particles and histology), to determine potential main target tissues and modes of toxic action. Most of the\navailable studies are focusing on short-term exposures. Considering the persistent nature of plastics in the environment, long-term studies involving multigenerational exposures should also be considered. Furthermore, identification of more sensitive phyla and life stages is also important to detect areas of increased risk, rank polymers in terms of noxious effects and ultimately suggest controlled production/use of polymers. The study of the role of non-chemical factors in the effects of micro(nano)plastics (e.g. ocean acidification, biotic stress) should also be studied.\nEffects on humans should also be assessed. In this perspective, in vitro systems may be valuable tools as they allow the study of modes of actions in organisms like fish and humans."

Although environmental awareness continues to grow, so does its consumption and associated risks. The number of studies reporting the presence of microplastics, has grown exponentially as did the concern over plastic degradation into smaller particles like nanoplastics, a potentially more pernicious form of plastic pollution. The reported effects of micro(nano) plastics on biota range from depletion of energy reserves and altered metabolism to immunological, neurotoxic effects and behavioral effects. This paper presents a critical review of current scientific knowledge in terms of reasons to study the effects of small plastics present in the environment, what has been assessed so far; most common methodologies. Research and technical developments requirements are also presented. Overall, it is clear the need for standardization of procedures and communication of",
