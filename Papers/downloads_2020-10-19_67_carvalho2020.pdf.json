Since the packaging can be hurdle technology to food protection and preservation, active packagings receive increasing attention due to the possibility of microbial, quality, and safety control of the product packed. Scope and approach: This Systematic Review aims to present strategies based on nanocarbon and biodegradables polymers to enhance main properties and adding new functionalities for packaging materials. A refined search on four databases in the last five years retrieved a total of 23 articles. This review focused on antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, target pathogens, and mechanisms. Key findings and conclusions: Carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, polylactide, and chitosan were the primary materials found increasing antimicrobial and antioxidant features. This work found bioactive compounds as a secondary approach. Both polymers from biomass and nanocarbons can play a role at antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant mechanisms. The surface area and pristine sp2 carbon domains on basal surfaces of graphene oxide contributed with radical stabilizing. The main modes of action proposed for bacterial and fungi control have been membrane disruption and oxidative stress. Although good potential against other pathogens, no work was recovered considering the antiviral activity of nanocomposites. Possibly, one of the significant promising alternatives for preservation of consumer’s health is the conventional antimicrobials replacement by bioactive compounds from natural sources associated with nanotechnology, since it proved to favor inhibition of the oxidation and several microbial growths synergistically."

      "text" : "Active packaging is an innovative technology of great interest of fresh and extended shelf-life of the food, in which the package, the product, and the environment interact to maintaining the quality of the product at the same time as prolong shelf-life, enhance safety, or sensory properties. Some examples of this active food packaging application include microbial, quality and temperature control, absorbing/scavenging properties, removing features, releasing/emitting properties (Nile et al., 2020; Prasad & Kochhar, 2014). Recent researches applied nanotechnology for innovative packaging materials showed great potential to enhance the packaging’s properties and adding new\nfunctionalities like active features (Cerqueira et al., 2018; Jie; Chen, Huang, et al., 2015; M.; Zhang et al., 2015). Moreover, it expected that nanotechnology use less raw materials and allowing the use of bio-based materials to solve the main challenges of traditional packaging solutions concerning petroleum-based plastics. (e.g., low gas barrier and controlled release of bioactive compounds) (Cerqueira et al., 2018; Juanni; Chen et al., 2014; Gleiter, 2000; M.; Zhang et al., 2015). Nanocarbons-based materials became a novel research interest in the recent developments in packaging applications.\nCarbon has the unique capacity to form various structures like carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanofibers (CNF), graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), graphite nanostacks (GR), graphene oxide (GO) and\n* Corresponding author.

The graphene family has unique characteristics as large specific surface area, high Young’s modulus, high thermal and electrical conductivity, good diffraction strength, charge carriers fast mobility and biocompatibility (Hasanzadeh & Shadjou, 2013; Hossain et al., 2019; Novoselov et al., 2005; M.; Zhang et al., 2015). Fig. 1 shows that the number of scientific publications related to nanocarbons and packagings applications rapidly raised starting from 2015.\nThe traditional polymers used for food packaging materials have several limitations like non-biodegradable, diminishing oil resources, environmental arrests for their disposal or incineration, and health or toxicity issues. These concerns and challenges motivate the development of a new environmentally-friendly field of packaging materials based on biodegradable polymers. Chitin and chitosan (CS) are polysaccharides from natural resources used for food contact applications that are nontoxic, biodegradable, and antimicrobial (Apjok et al., 2019; Arfat et al., 2018; Ghanbarzadeh et al., 2015).\nThe oxidation is the leading cause of the off-odors and off-tastes formation within the oxidizing compounds present in food packaging, resulting in their reduced quality and safety (Jamr�oz et al., 2019). Oxygen scavenger films were successfully developed by adding TiO2 nanoparticles to different polymers (Shen et al., 2019). Enzymes between polyethylene films were also prepared (L�opez et al., 2007). More recently, researchers reported the scavenging ability of rGO with three biodegradable polymer matrices (Barra et al., 2019; Jamr�oz et al., 2019; Pal et al., 2019), as a result of the surface area and pristine sp2 carbon domains on basal surfaces of GO (Qiu et al., 2014).\nIt is well established that silver nanoparticles and silver coatings (AgNPs) can promote antimicrobial properties and radical or UV scavenger’s abilities. Nano-silver, Nano zinc oxide (ZnO), nano titanium dioxide (TiO2-NPs) were also used in antimicrobial food packagings (Apjok et al., 2019; Jie; Chen, Huang, et al., 2015; Dallas et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2016; Vaezi et al., 2019; Q.; Xu et al., 2019; W.; Xu et al., 2017; M.; Zhang et al., 2015). The cytotoxicity effect of nanocarbons was found in multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), CNF, GR, GNP, GO, and rGO (Demitri et al., 2016; S.; Liu et al., 2011; Montes et al., 2018; Rojas-Andrade et al., 2017; Y.; Wang et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2016). Researchers reported membrane stress, oxidative stress, wrapping, trapping, photothermal effect, electron transfer, and basal plane as antimicrobial mechanisms of nanocarbons against several fungal and bacterial species (Jie Chen, Huang, et al., 2015; Dellieu et al., 2015; F. Li et al., 2019; Pham et al., 2015; Shahnawaz Khan et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2016; Smith & Rodrigues, 2015; Tu et al., 2013; Veerapandian et al., 2013).\nDespite their excellent properties, nanocarbons has poor solubility due to its tendency to aggregate because of strong inter-planar interactions, which can severely limit its antimicrobial application. A work reported that higher antibacterial activity is present when GO\naggregates have the smallest average size (S. Liu et al., 2011). Thus, as a potential for the active packaging technology, antimicrobial could be enhanced when nanocarbons are incorporated in a polymer matrix to form stable nanocarbon-polymer dispersion, avoiding their aggregations. (X. Chen, Huang, et al., 2015; Ghanbarzadeh et al., 2015; M. Zhang et al., 2015).\nOther promising approaches to enhance the active feature are essential oils (EOs) and phytochemicals extracted from aromatic plants. These strategies appeared as the focus of numerous works due to their organoleptic properties and potential in the food and pharmaceutical industry as antimicrobials (L�opez et al., 2007; Ribeiro-Santos et al., 2017; Ruiz-Navajas et al., 2013). At the same time, the amino and hydroxyl groups frequently present in the surface of EOs, and others in polyphenols can play an essential role in oxidation inhibition by hydrogen atom donation. Thus, these compounds can be excellent candidates to be used as antioxidant agents. Moreover, EOs have been used safely in foods, and are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 2014, 2016).\nThe purpose of the current systematic review was addressing the role of nanocarbons/sustainable polymer-based nanocomposites as a potential to be applied in active packagings, through a refined search carried out on four research platforms (Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed). The role of a different kind of biodegradable polymer and carbon-based nanomaterials in active packaging properties are evaluated, with focus on the antimicrobial, their type of pathogens, their mechanism of action, and, finally, the antioxidant activity and its central mechanisms, as a potential to be used in active food packaging."

Possible sources of bias assessment include inclusion/exclusion criteria and the impact of missing data.\nThe retrieved papers of search sources were realized through a search string that summarizes the questions researched. In this context, we defined a strategy composed of four phases to build the search strings: (i) identification of keywords considering the research question; (ii) synonyms based on relevant studies about nanocarbons and biodegradable polymers; and (iii) use of “AND” and “OR” Booleans operators. The search was based on pre-determined groups of keywords and related to graphene-based nanomaterials, biodegradable polymers, and their application in active food packaging accordingly. The language search was English. The period was set between 2015 and 2020 and was performed on February 8 and 10, 2020.

      "text" : "The biodegradable nanocomposites recovered and analyzed in this SR studied antimicrobial (i.e., antibacterial and antifungal activity) and antioxidant properties as active properties. Some biodegradable polymers and active components can kill or inhibit spoilage, and pathogenic microbial embraced in contaminating foods forming antimicrobial packaging (Cerqueira et al., 2018; Prasad & Kochhar, 2014).\nUsually, the origin of biodegradable polymers classifies them in (i) natural polymers obtained from natural resources and (ii) conventional synthetic polymers produced from petroleum-based monomers. Renewable sources like biomass, microorganisms, and biotechnology is a resource to the first one. The second use of conventional synthesis from synthetic monomers, polyesteramides, polycaprolactones, and aliphatic/aromatic polyesters (Cerqueira et al., 2018). Researchers studied both nanocomposites of biodegradable polymers from natural sources and synthetic sources: furcellaram (FUR), CS, agar, starch, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polylactide (PLA), poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxy valerate) (PHBV), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) (Arfat et al., 2018; Gouvêa et al., 2018; Jamr�oz et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2016; F.; Li et al., 2019; Y.; Liu et al., 2019; Mahmoudi et al., 2016; Mohamed & Abd El-Ghany, 2018; Montes et al., 2018; Naskar et al., 2018; Usman et al., 2016; Youssef et al., 2019). The nanocomposites displayed antibacterial activity against gram-positive (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus) bacterias by in vitro assays (Arfat et al., 2018; Gan et al., 2020; Gouvêa et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2015; Jamr�oz et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2016; F.; Li et al., 2019; Y.; Liu et al., 2019; Mahmoudi et al., 2016; Mohamed & Abd El-Ghany, 2018; Naskar et al., 2018; Pal et al., 2017; Rivera-Briso et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2019; Song et al., 2015; Usman et al., 2016; W.; Xu et al., 2017; Youssef et al., 2019; R.; Zhang et al., 2019). Fig. 3 illustrates the biodegradable polymers studied in the recovered papers in the current SR.\nAntifungal activity was achieved through MWCNTs, GNP, and GO against Rhizopus stolonifera, Aspergillus niger, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans and Botrytis cinerea fungi by MO models and in vitro tests (Demitri et al., 2016; Y.; Liu et al., 2019; Mohamed & Abd El-Ghany, 2018; Montes et al., 2018; W.; Xu et al., 2017; Youssef et al., 2019). Antioxidant capacity through GO, rGO and CQDs were shown by 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 20-azinobis-(3-ethyl- benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTSþ) radical scavenging, iron ion reduction capacity (FRAP), and metal ion chelating capacity (Barra et al., 2019; Jamr�oz et al., 2019; Pal et al., 2019).\nDifferent methodologies were used for the preparation of nanocomposites: in-situ polymerization (Shen et al., 2019); melting blending technique (Montes et al., 2018); blending/dispersion by mechanical force (El-Ghany, 2018; Gouvêa et al., 2018; Mohamed & Abd; Shen et al., 2019); electrospinning to fabricate composite nanofibrous (Y. Liu et al., 2019; R. Zhang et al., 2019); solvent precipitation technique (Kumar et al., 2016); nano-hybrid membranes by casting (Song et al., 2015); two-solvent assisted casting method (Gan et al., 2020). The most common was films prepared by solution casting methods (Arfat et al., 2018; Barra et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2015; Jamr�oz et al., 2019; F.; Li et al., 2019; Mahmoudi et al., 2016; Naskar et al., 2018; Pal et al., 2017; Rivera-Briso et al., 2020; Usman et al., 2016; W.; Xu et al., 2017; Youssef et al., 2019) (See more in Table 2).\nRegarding the mechanism of antimicrobial activity of this kind of bio-nanocomposites, there are several modes of action proposed through both physical and chemical mechanisms. Nevertheless, the works proposed the membrane damage, oxidative stress, and electron transfer as the main modes of actions for the antimicrobial activity of graphenebased materials. The direct interaction mechanism between GO sheets and bacterial cells/fungal spores by the cell wrapping and direct contact with the cell wall or membrane, probably cause partly severe structural damages of pathogens via membrane depolarization. Thus, it may impact physiological metabolism processes leading to the microbial death or bacterial/spores growth inhibition (Juanni Chen et al., 2014).\nThe 2D structure forming sp2 covalent bonds of graphene promotes a strong interaction with membrane lipids, and it has been a dependant of significant concentrations of graphene and the larger sharp edge of the graphene sheets (Juanni Chen et al., 2014; Hossain et al., 2019; Tu et al., 2013). GO also can induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus damaging to microbial proteins and lipids, acting very like to disinfect the microbial (Smith & Rodrigues, 2015). Electron transfer from the nanomaterial surface to the microbial membrane also played a vital role. At the entrapment mechanism, the microbial isolated from their surroundings is incapable of proliferating due to gas exchange/blocked iron when trapped in aggregated GO sheets (Hossain et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2016). GO is also used as a photo-absorbing agent for photothermal therapy, and to improve the capacity of antimicrobial activity (Hossain et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2016). Finally, the antimicrobial activity of GO sheets displayed a necessity on their adjacent dimension in gram-negative bacteria inhibition growth. Oxidation capacity and aggregation state of the GO layers can wield considerable influence in antimicrobial activity (Veerapandian et al., 2013).\nThe nanocarbons functionalization makes them suitable to be employed in a plurality of applications. It is considered an essential strategy for several purposes: improve interactions with polar matrices, improve solubility, and enhance the physical properties when impregnated into other materials to form hybrids. (Gan et al., 2020; Naskar et al., 2018; Pal et al., 2019). For example, MWCNTs in their unmodified state, have strong aromatic nature taking it to aggregate due to van der Waals interactions. Thus, MWCNTs have a low water solubility due to its poor surface chemistry, non-flexibility, and inability to form film composites by themselves. Therefore, the functionalization of MWCNTs can turn it soluble by grafting hydrophobic groups in its backbone, such as –OH and –COOH groups (Youssef et al., 2019).\nIn most cases, the surface modifications are fundamental to improve the interface adhesion between the continuous (polymer matrix) and discontinuous (nanofiller) phases. Consequently, physical and chemical properties were improved (Youssef et al., 2019), increasing together antimicrobial and antioxidant activities (Jamr�oz et al., 2019). Another approach reported applies EOs and other antioxidant agents (Arfat et al., 2018; Demitri et al., 2016). Some strategies promoted better antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, in particular, the polymer and nanomaterial surface modification (Mohamed & Abd El-Ghany, 2018; Shen et al., 2019; Youssef et al., 2019). Furthermore, the main thermal, mechanical, and barrier properties, as well as compatibility, were also affected, as showed in Table 2. CS, PHBV, PCL, and PLA have been tested and show biocompatibility features."

Functionalized CS with an electron-rich group (imine, epoxide, hydroxyls, NH, CONHNH, and free amines), when protonated in an acidic medium, promotes an improved antibacterial activity by electrostatic interactions. It can be explained by a change in the permeability of the cell membrane and a disturbance in the cell properties, resulting in internal osmotic imbalance, thereby inhibiting the bacterial growth (Y. Liu et al., 2019). Thus, the interactions between the ionic surface of modified CS and the charged bacterial cell membrane can lead to leakage of the protein and the intercellular components, accelerating the bacterial cell death (Song et al., 2015). Moreover, CS can act as a metal chelating agent,\nsuppressing spore elements, and binding to essential nutrients preventing bacterial growth (Mohamed & Abd El-Ghany, 2018). CS molecules are also assumed to be able to penetrate the nuclei of bacteria and bind with their DNA, inhibiting their ability to synthesize RNA and proteins (Mohamed & Abd El-Ghany, 2018).\nMWCNTs can enhance antibacterial activity across a synergistic effect on bacterial inhibition by the destruction of the membrane cell and suppression of microbial growth (Mohamed & Abd El-Ghany, 2018). The principle mechanism of action seemed to be associated with an improvement of the surface roughness and hydrophobic character, which increases the interaction between CS and the bacteria (Song et al.,\nA.P.A. Carvalho and C.A. Conte Junior\nTrends in Food Science & Technology 103 (2020) 130–143\n2015). Thus, CS can bind to the bacterial cell wall, via van der Waals forces, destroying the bacterial capsule, leaking microbial intercellular contents (Mohamed & Abd El-Ghany, 2018). The nanocomposites can adsorb on the surface of the bacteria cell wall binding with metals of the nutrient essential to the bacterial growth, and causing microbe death (Mohamed & Abd El-Ghany, 2018). The antibacterial of CS-MWCNTs is slightly more active against gram-positive bacteria (Table 3). Still, the composites displayed comparable or even better antibacterial activities than their references Gentamicin and Ampicillin.Nevertheless, the CS can be mixed with PLA and MWCNTs to forming an electrospun fiber, improving its poor mechanical properties and water resistance, which limits its practical application. Thus, the PLA/CS composites can exhibit excellent antimicrobial performance and sustainable options. The mechanism proposed was related to cell death caused by cell nutrient transportation inhibition since CS disposed of protein moieties to interact with lipopolysaccharides. The mechanism takes several interferences through electrostatic effects: (i) changes in the permeability of membrane cell and cell wall, giving rise internal osmotic imbalance, thus inhibiting bacterial growth; and (ii) inducing hydrolysis of peptidoglycan in the cell wall, leaking intracellular electrolytes, thus causing bacterial death. This type of nanocomposites is CS content-dependent: as\nCS increases more than nine wt%, the antimicrobial decreases. It was explained by the occurrence of partial CNT aggregations, which affects the homogeneous distribution of CS, and the poor distribution of MWCNT and CS into PLA, affecting the release rate of CS (Y. Liu et al., 2019). MWCNTs also present a bacterial killing effect when incorporated into a PVA matrix. The destructive effect of MWCNTs has been reported to be also concentration-dependent and is better for the highest contents of the nanofiller (Youssef et al., 2019).\nThe antibacterial modes of action of graphene family have been related to the physical disruption caused throughout the contact of the graphene sharp edge-bacterial membranes and by the photon-thermal ablation and wrapping associated with physical damages. The chemical mechanisms are associated with oxidative stress generated by charge transfer and ROS. The well-dispersed graphene sheets in a polymer increase the antibacterial activity of graphene due to the better dispersion, providing high surface contact area with bacteria, and causing mechanical rupture of their membrane by the strong and sharp edge graphene flakes.\nPLA was combined with different graphene based-nanomaterials and hybrid nanoparticles, resulting in nanocomposites with higher antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli (Arfat et al., 2018; Huang\nADA: agar diffusion assay.

Conte Junior\nTrends in Food Science & Technology 103 (2020) 130–143\net al., 2015; F.; Li et al., 2019; Pal et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2019; R.; Zhang et al., 2019). Various factors such as the preparation method, nanoparticle concentration-dependence, higher contents of essential oil released, and the dispersion as well morphology state of distribution of filler into PLA matrix, had influence final nanocomposites (Arfat et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2015; J.; Li et al., 2014; Pal et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2019). A work reported the use of PLA/GO film to release clove essential oil (CLO) with higher antibacterial activity. The antimicrobial mechanisms of CLO were related to (i) the eugenol capability to penetrating the cell wall and cell membrane to destructs the structure, thus leading the loss of intracellular components and causing the cell death; (ii) the inhibition of DNA replications; and (iii) synthesis of proteins fundamentals to cell growth (Arfat et al., 2018; Burt, 2004). GO surfaces improved the antibacterial activity of Ag nanoparticles into PLA due to better Ag-cell wall interactions, thankful the well-distribution of Ag into GO surfaces, and the well-dispersibility of the hybrids, which was improved by in situ polymerization method (Shen et al., 2019). The primary antibacterial mechanism associated with Ag nanoparticles is cell wall destruction, separating it off the cell membrane, thus causing DNA damages (An et al., 2009; Sharma et al., 2009).\nCellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and rGO were incorporated into PLA, forming a new bio-nanocomposite film by casting, which was\ncytocompatible and shown antibacterial potential to active packaging materials (Pal et al., 2017). Huang et al. (2015) tested, at light and dark conditions, the synergistic effect of GO and ZnO nanoparticles in PLA with remarkable antibacterial activity. In the light irradiation, the Hþ reacts with OH- on the ZnO surfaces, generating ROS, and damaging cells. Moreover, continuous conductive paths built on GO sheets by ZnO dispersed, reduce the charge transfer resistance, and inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron and holes (Huang et al., 2015; J.; Li et al., 2014; Pal et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2019; R.; Zhang et al., 2019).\nPVA did not show antibacterial activity. Thus, GO combined to ZnO NPs, a well-known antimicrobial agent, was used as a strategy to successfully promote the antibacterial activity of the PVA composite nanofibrous membrane. Zhang et al. (2019) suggested some mechanisms. In essence, the trapped ZnO NPs produce ROS to damage bacterial cell structure. In turn, the ROS, as the accumulation of ZnO NPs within the cytoplasm on bacterial, could inhibit or kill the microbial. Still, GO can benefit cell attachment and antibacterial activity (R. Zhang et al., 2019). Another strategy consisted of the addition of starch and GO combined with AgNps, another well-known antimicrobial agent. Starch was capable of inducing structural changes in GO, reducing it to rGO from exfoliated state to intercalated state in PVA, providing better\nA.P.A. Carvalho and C.A. Conte Junior\nTrends in Food Science & Technology 103 (2020) 130–143\ndistribution into the PVA matrix. Thus, the antibacterial effect was a result of the synergistic effects of GO and AgNPs into the PVA matrix by the presence of starch (Usman et al., 2016).\nPCL is a synthetic polymer matrix which has presented antibacterial activity in the presence of rGO/Ag hybrids. The hybrids yield better performance than pure AgNPs and pure rGO. This behavior was attributed to direct contact killing by mechanical rupture of the bacterial cells through dispersed rGO/Ag hybrids along with the slow and steady release of Agþ. Moreover, the electrical and mechanical properties were also improved (Kumar et al., 2016).\nNo work reported bacterial growth inhibition around a PHBV film sample. The addition of GO yielded excellent antibacterial properties against S. aureus for PHBV, and it was improved to 100% when GO grafting to CNC with a compact structure and favorable interfacial adhesion between GO and CNC. The bacterial death seemed to be related to (i) GO damaged the bacterial cell membranes through oxidative stress or free radicals, and (ii) bacteria isolated from normal environment reducing its ability to extract nutrients for growth (F. Li et al., 2019).\nAnother approach to enhance the performance of PHBV involves GO and CNF. In terms of antibacterial effects, GO was better than CNF (Rivera-Briso et al., 2020). Although the absence of antibacterial effect by agar diffusion assay, the addition of ZnO to rGO, promoted bactericidal action against E. coli cells, due to direct contact between cells and the surface of the hybrids (Gouvêa et al., 2018). The mechanisms proposed to explain the antibacterial activity were: (i) an intimate contact between bacteria and rGO-ZnO particles located at the surface of the hybrids, resulting in cell death by the direct membrane damage, or by the action of ROS possibly formed during UV radiation, performed before the tests; and (ii) the membrane damage (Gouvêa et al., 2018; Rojas-Andrade et al., 2017; Y.-W.; Wang et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2016).\nThe addition of GO nanolayers to CS/PVP films improved the bactericidal capacity, and the main mechanisms proposed were the\nphysical interaction between the sharp edges of the GO sheets and the bacterial cell membrane, and oxidative stress (Mahmoudi et al., 2016). The antibacterial activity of CS-GO-TiO2 against B. subtilis was very higher, at around 99.9%, decreasing the bacterial cell viability at different rates in a concentration-dependent manner after nanocomposites treatment (W. Xu et al., 2017). The antibacterial mechanism was investigated by fluorescence and morphological characterizations and suggested to be related to the cell death induced by GO–CS–TiO2 exposure caused by damage of cell walls and cell membranes. The morphological characterizations showed the cell walls of B. subtilis significantly wrinkled and damaged, and cell shape and size were changed. Therefore, the strong adhesion of the GO–CS–TiO2 nanocomposites to the bacteria leads the cell membranes destruction, followed by cell deformations and structure changes (W. Xu et al., 2017).\nAgar or agar-agar is another polysaccharide with gel-forming properties very useful in the food industry. A nanocomposite based on agar/ rGO-PEG-Ag-ZnO hybrid showed high (95%) anti-biofilm activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa bacterias as well as eradication of preformed biofilm. Both rGO and ZnNps presented the ability of biofilm inhibition. Still, AgNps was appointed to be the reason for the efficiency of the nanocomposites in killing the bacterial cells, which was Ag concentration-dependent (Naskar et al., 2018). The mechanism proposed to explain the anti-biofilm activity considered that the water channels throughout the biofilm could be the reason for the anti-biofilm activity of Ag NPs. Besides, nutrient transportation was a function of water channels or pores in the biofilms (Du et al., 2015; Kalishwaralal et al., 2010; Naskar et al., 2018).\nA promising type of active packaging can be made by the incorporation of EOs providing packaging foods to extend food shelf-life, at the same time, preserving the nutritional and sensory quality of food (Burt, 2004). In this SR, two studies confirmed the potential use of graphene-based material for EOs releasing as an antimicrobial for food\nADA: agar diffusion assay. PDA: nutrient agar and potato dextrose.

Relative to CLO, the antimicrobial efficacy was confirmed through a very higher inhibition against S. aureus and E. coli, and the extent of inhibition was incubated time and CLO’s concentration-dependent (Arfat et al., 2018). Concerning the antimicrobial mechanism of CLO, the study consulted associates the capacity of CLO’s eugenol and other hydrophobic components to penetrating the cell wall and cell membrane, disrupting cell structure, leading to the loss of the intracellular component, and causing cell death (Arfat et al., 2018; Burt, 2004; Demitri et al., 2016). Additionally, CLO causes a plasticizing effect improving the flexibility of the films and mechanical properties of the GO.\nFUR is another polysaccharide with gel-forming properties, obtained from red algae Furcellaria lumbricalis, that presented antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica (Jamr�oz et al., 2019). Electroluminescent films based on FUR, GO, and CQDs showed an inhibitory effect on bacteria growth. Except for FUR/GO nanocomposites, that showed inhibitory effect only for S. aureus, the FUR/CQDs presented an antibacterial activity for both S. aureus and E. coli. Furthermore, the tensile strength of FUR films remarkably increased with GO addition. Instead, the water content, solubility, and elongation at break significantly reduced by the addition of the nanofillers (Jamr�oz et al., 2019). The primary antimicrobial modes of action of CQDs were already associated with the production of ROS, destruction of cell wall/membrane, and interactions with nucleus components (Rajendiran et al., 2019). The system also showed antioxidant activity.\nIn most cases, the studies reported the antibacterial effect slightly more active against S. aureus than E.coli bacteria (Table 3). These results were attributed to the more complex gram-negative cell wall, both structurally and chemically, which has an extra outer membrane restricting the dispersion of the hydrophobic substances by the cytoplasmic membrane (Arfat et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2015; F.; Li et al., 2019; Mahmoudi et al., 2016; Pal et al., 2017; R.; Zhang et al., 2019). Fig. 4 summarizes de most common antimicrobial modes of action of carbon-based nanomaterials reported in the studies recovered in this systematic review."

      "text" : "Table 4 shows the antifungal activity of nanocomposites based on nanocarbons and biodegradable polymers as a potential for active packaging materials. The natural polymer CS also presents antifungal activity (Y. Liu et al., 2019), that effectively inhibit spore germination,\ngerm tube elongation, and radial growth (El Ghaouth et al., 1992; Mohamed & Abd El-Ghany, 2018). MWCNTs improved the antimicrobial activity of aminohydrazine cross-linked CS against A. niger, C. neoformans, and C. tropicalis. The antifungal activity was attributed to interactions of CS and MWCNT with the fungal cell wall, disrupting the cell function, and leading to fungi death (Mohamed & Abd El-Ghany, 2018). Besides, the antifungal performance was better than the reference fungicide (Mohamed & Abd El-Ghany, 2018). The antifungal mechanism proposed involves cell wall morphogenesis with CS molecules interfering directly in fungal growth (El Ghaouth et al., 1992; Mohamed & Abd El-Ghany, 2018). Beyond that, CS molecules diffuse inside hyphae and bind with the DNA preventing the formation of mRNA and, consequently, affecting the production of essential nutrients for fungal growth (Eweis et al., 2006; Mohamed & Abd El-Ghany, 2018).\nSoluble MWCNTs/PVA nanocomposites presented a fungal growth inhibition against C. albicans and A. niger when incorporated into the PVA matrix, and it was concentration-dependent and better for the higher contents of the MWCNTs (Youssef et al., 2019). The mechanisms proposed were: (i) DNA loses its replication ability, and cellular proteins become deactivated (Youssef et al., 2019), or (ii) COCl-MWCNTs releasing from the PVA system, preventing or inhibiting the birth and MO growth (Youssef et al., 2019).\nThe composite fibers of CS/PLA/CNT exhibited excellent antifungal properties similar to CS treated results in the aggregation of fungal spores and morphological disturbances, such as swelling, germ tube emergence, and polarization. Besides, the composite fibers of CS/PLA/ CNT exhibited better antibacterial than antifungal activity (Y. Liu et al., 2019).\nGNP and GO were already incorporated into biodegradable polymers, such as CS and PLA, to give antimicrobial and enhanced mechanical properties, promoting their use as potential active packaging materials in the food industry. The graphene family demonstrates the ability to inhibit mycelial growth of A. niger, B. subtilis, and Rhizopus spp. (Demitri et al., 2016; Montes et al., 2018; W.; Xu et al., 2017). In general, the work proposed that the antifungal mechanism of rGO is related to direct contact with the fungal cell walls, and the reaction between oxygen functional groups of rGO and organic groups of polysaccharides on the fungal cell walls (Sawangphruk et al., 2012). An antifungal effect it is also possible for nanocomposites with PLA/GNP and GNP-CNC hybrids. The antifungal properties were achieved against A. niger, finding a superior antifungal activity in the CNC/GNP hybrid films. The antifungal activity increased with the graphene content and was higher for PLA-GNP formulation (Montes et al., 2018; Sawangphruk et al., 2012).\nA.P.A. Carvalho and C.A. Conte Junior\nTrends in Food Science & Technology 103 (2020) 130–143\nGO can also be combined with TiO2 into CS, promoting a mycelial growth inhibition of A. niger at around 95%, exhibiting high antimicrobial activity against the biofilm-forming strains A. niger (W. Xu et al., 2017). Another approach of antifungal activity contains CNM-functionalized CS against Rhizopus spp. CNM was an antimicrobial agent against a large number of microorganisms due to the presence of oxygen groups in direct contact with the fungi cell walls, which generally is the most common antifungal mechanism associated with EOs (Demitri et al., 2016). The addition of graphite nano-stacks significantly enhances the CNM releasing and the mechanical properties of the final material (Demitri et al., 2016). The authors reported various factors contributing to CNM’s antifungal mechanism of inducing pathogen death. In a concentration-dependent manner, the ROS accumulated in cell microbial seemed to the main route underlying the cell damage caused by CNM (Demitri et al., 2016; Y.; Wang et al., 2018)."

      "text" : "Oxidation reactions can generate undesirable and unhealthful substances compromising the food flavors. Thus, oxidation of food must be prevented and is one of the major concerns because it is causing food losses in the industry. The incorporation of antioxidant species into packaging preserving packed food can be an effective strategy against oxidizing agents (Jamr�oz et al., 2019; Pal et al., 2019). Table 5 shows the antioxidant properties of studies with polymer/graphene-based nanocomposites recovered in this SR as a potential active food packaging material.\nThe antioxidant activity of nanocomposites based on biodegradable polymer/graphene-based nanomaterials was examined through three studies discussing their ability to scavenge DPPH radicals, ABTSþ radical, iron ion reduction capacity (FRAP), and metal chelating ability. The studies reported PLA, CS, and FUR combined with PEG-TOCNCrGO, GO, and rGO-CQDs, respectively (Barra et al., 2019; Jamr�oz et al., 2019; Pal et al., 2019). CQDs and rGO did not significantly affect the FRAP capacity, while the CQDs showed the ability to chelate metal ions at 18.6%. Moreover, the FUR-based films showed DPPH radical scavenging capacity significantly increased with the addition of GO and CQDs, providing high antioxidant activity in the form of hydroxyl and superoxide radical scavenging (Jamr�oz et al., 2019).\nThe addition of rGO into the CS matrix leads to a considerable increase of ABTSþ inhibition after 8h, promoting an antioxidant activity for bio-nanocomposites with a significant content of nanofiller (52–82%). The residual caffeic acid involved in a green methodology to the reduction process of GO to rGO might contribute to improving the antioxidant activity (Barra et al., 2019; Nunes et al., 2013). The most common modes of action of different antioxidant compounds are reached out by a redox transition, including the donation of a single electron or a hydrogen atom from the antioxidant to a free radical. Therefore, recent findings demonstrated the antioxidant action of NH groups in Serotonin and Histamine, and OH groups in other polyphenols, which at the same time results in the excellent antioxidant behavior (Mahmudzadeh et al., 2019). On the other hand, the higher surface area and pristine sp2 carbon domains on basal surfaces of GO can also induce a scavenging activity (Qiu et al., 2014).\nRegarding the radical scavenger mechanism of GO/CS, the amino and carboxyl moieties of CS could stabilize free radicals (Zhao et al., 2018). Consequently, providing a synergistic effect with graphene scavenger ability, which could explain the tremendous antioxidant response for CS/GO system. Fig. 5 illustrates a hypothetical schematic representation of the antioxidant activity as a result of synergism between graphene-based nanomaterial and bioactive compounds potentially antioxidant, as shown in the studies retrieved in this systematic review.\nThe addition of rGO/CNC hybrids into PLA also enhances the antioxidant activity. This antioxidant property was increased with the uniform dispersion of CNC and rGO in the hydrophobic PLA throughout\nCNC’s surface modifications with TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical), followed by surface functionalization of TEMPOoxidized CNC (TOCNC) carry out with polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Pal et al., 2019)."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions and Outlook",
      "text" : "The studies recovered in the systematic literature search shows that several biodegradable polymer matrices, from natural and synthetic sources, were investigated in terms of active properties for packaging materials applications. Much fewer studies recovered used fossil-based polymers. The studies analyzed in this systematic review show that excellent dispersion and uniform distribution of the nanofillers into polymer matrices are the fundamental factors to enhance the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, and also the preparation method can play an important role. As an alternative to overcome challenges in limited properties of biodegradable polymers from bio-sources, it was identified as the primary strategy the mixing with other polymers and surface modification. Further, the suitable dispersion and distribution of filler-matrix improve interfacial interaction and adhesion, thus enhancing the desirable active properties. One of the challenges was found in biopolymers from biomass sources as proteins and polysaccharides.\nSeveral efforts concentrated on evaluating the antibacterial of MWCNTs and GO. At the same time, fewer studies dedicated to rGO, and only limited studies dedicated to the antibacterial activity of CQDs and CNF. The antibacterial tests on most of the nanocarbons were carried out mainly for S. aureus and E. coli. The high efficiency of the GO to inhibit bacterial proliferation and sporulation suggests its potential for developing a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against other pathogenic microorganisms. Although the majority of the studies reached active properties on antibacterial activity, fewer researches evaluated antifungal activities of biodegradable polymers-nanocarbons systems, and most of them took place against A. niger. Moreover, no study has been recovered in this systematic literature search focus on antiviral or antiprotozoal activity, temperature control, or removing properties.\nThis review showed that bioactive compounds could be good candidates to enhance, at the same time, the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of nanomaterials-based packaging. The amino and hydroxyl groups often present in the surface of polyphenols can play an essential role in oxidation inhibition by hydrogen atom donation. Besides, the antioxidant activity can be improved by the synergism between H donations and trapping graphene layers. Promising examples of active properties for food packaging applications incorporating bioactive compounds with nanocarbons/sustainable polymers were discussed only with cinnamaldehyde, caffeic acid, and eugenol from clove essential oil, which open new opportunities to research in this field with potential alternatives from natural sources. The antioxidant activity was studied mainly in terms of DHPP stabilizing. Furthermore, this review shown by articles recovered the synergistic effect of graphene-based materials reinforcements and the plasticizer effect of EOs, giving rise flexibility. At the same time, graphene based-nanomaterials can enhance other mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties for polymer matrices.\nThis systematic review allows for identifying future research opportunities. As an example, the evaluation of migration levels from nanoparticle to food and toxicological evaluations for other nanocarbons. Another is to investigate how nanoparticles can affect biodegradation rates and how the EOs release kinetics from the composite film can provide more comprehensive information on the antimicrobial actions. Above all, it encourages to extend the concept to other pathogenic microorganisms, like a virus. Since the end of 2019, the world has suffered from the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the SARs-CoV-2 virus. The nanotechnology scientific community received a call in direction to accelerate the translation of research investigations to establish nanotechnology advances as a frontline approach in the fight of coronavirus pandemic (Chan 2020).\nA.P.A. Carvalho and C.A. Conte Junior\nTrends in Food Science & Technology 103 (2020) 130–143\nHereafter, active packaging technology must provide one of the research targets for the development of packaging able to help in preventing infectious diseases beyond microbial control against a broad-spectrum of pathogens.\nFinally, both bio-based polymer (e.g., CS, FUR) and nanocarbons can play a role at antimicrobial and antioxidant activities through various mechanisms, considering physical and chemical modes. However, membrane damage, oxidative stress, and electron transfer are the main mechanisms that appeared as suggestions for antimicrobial activity. We expected that this systematic review about the recent advances on active properties of nanocarbons/biodegradable nanocomposites, including their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, can help researchers with insights to overcome the associated challenges into the development of new and improved active packaging materials. We also hope that this article can stimulate academic and industrial scientists to contribute to the fight of COVID-19, giving directions to new studies and the development of novel packaging materials with antiviral activities.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors have no conflicts to interest to disclose."

    "abstractText" : "Background: The emergence of microorganisms resistant to antibiotics and oxidation processes are serious challenges faced by the food packaging industry. Since the packaging can be hurdle technology to food protection and preservation, active packagings receive increasing attention due to the possibility of microbial, quality, and safety control of the product packed. Scope and approach: This Systematic Review aims to present strategies based on nanocarbon and biodegradables polymers to enhance main properties and adding new functionalities for packaging materials. A refined search on four databases in the last five years retrieved a total of 23 articles. This review focused on antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, target pathogens, and mechanisms. Key findings and conclusions: Carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, polylactide, and chitosan were the primary materials found increasing antimicrobial and antioxidant features. This work found bioactive compounds as a secondary approach. Both polymers from biomass and nanocarbons can play a role at antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant mechanisms. The surface area and pristine sp2 carbon domains on basal surfaces of graphene oxide contributed with radical stabilizing. The main modes of action proposed for bacterial and fungi control have been membrane disruption and oxidative stress. Although good potential against other pathogens, no work was recovered considering the antiviral activity of nanocomposites. Possibly, one of the significant promising alternatives for preservation of consumer’s health is the conventional antimicrobials replacement by bioactive compounds from natural sources associated with nanotechnology, since it proved to favor inhibition of the oxidation and several microbial growths synergistically.",
