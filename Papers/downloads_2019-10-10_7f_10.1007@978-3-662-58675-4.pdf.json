John Daniell (1836) developed primary battery in the form of a cell which could deliver 1.1 V and specific energy less than 0.1 MJ/kg to power these devices and the demand for greater output never ceased. Almost 115 years later, Lew Urry developed (1949) the Alkaline Manganese Battery with 1.25 V and a specific energy around 0.4 MJ/kg. Almost 20 years later (in 1971) Alexandr Kloss and Boris Tsenter implemented nickel and hydrogen to form the precursor of the Nickel Metal Hydride battery, also able to deliver 1.2 V but at a higher specific energy (~140 MJ/kg). Lastly, the work by Akira Yoshino of Asahi Chemical led to the lithium-ion battery at 1.5 V and a specific energy density of 0.8 MJ/kg. This was rapidly followed by the lithium polymer battery which had a flexible casing and enabled the form factor to be altered. Portable electronics could be used for longer periods, including cell phones, laptops, and multimedia devices, such as tablets, ipads, nanoPCs, and wearable electronics, increasing lithium-ion battery sales past the billion units sold mark.\nThe advantage of the lithium-ion rechargeable batteries as secondary batteries (LIB) relative to nickel-cadmium or nickel-hydride batteries is the endurance of the battery coupled with high specific energy density and no memory effects. These storage devices make up the top three choices, after which manganese dioxide-zinc and lead acid are the next most common storage device. Unlike the other metals, lithium has distinct advantages. It has a low atomic mass, low ionization enthalpy, and high electrode potential, resulting in high energy density relative to zinc-based batteries.\nLithium-ion batteries are a system where the lithium metal forms the anode with a nonaqueous electrolyte such as propylene carbonate-lithium perchlorate and carbonbased cathode. The lithium at the anode forms whisker-like formations which resemble dendrites, causing the battery to short-circuit, in addition to safety issues related to a strong oxidizer such as perchlorate. Other concerns relate to replacement of lithium aluminum and/or polyacene conducting polymer used for memory backup or powering small devices with solar recharge, which may be less efficient and more costly. The “current” lithium-ion batteries do not have lithium metal but intercalation of lithium ions into the active electrode surfaces, using the Asahi design, which uses\nv\nthe carbon-based anode and lithium cobalt oxide as the cathode. During charging, lithium would be inserted into the carbon anode, and during discharging, lithium would be extracted. The battery design due to conducting polymers could be cylindrical and was 18 mm by 65 mm in length and known as 18650 type with a capacity of 800 mAh/g. During the decades, after World War II, the demands for portable energy have progressively increased, requiring design of a new generation of energy storage devices. Recently, increased battery usage and lifespan have been achieved by the substitution of carbon-based anodes with more flexible graphitebased carbon and changes to electrolyte and modification of lithium cobalt oxides and cell design (polymers, binders, and internal circuitry) relative to lithium only anodes. The early batteries contained mesophase carbon microbead (MCMB with a capacity of 280 mAh/g). By incorporating functional electrolytes that passivate the electrode, higher graphitization of the anode carbon material can be achieved without solvent decomposition, leading to greater catalyticity at the active electrode surface. This graphitization could be accomplished using mesophase carbon fiber, or more active form of MCMBs yielding capacity of 372 mAh.g 1. The addition of cyclohexylbenzene would lead to the generation of hydrogen gas at higher voltages and would interrupt the current output, safely shutting down the battery. In the early 2000s, the 18650 type cell had a capacity of 2.4 Ah or an energy density of 200 Wh/ kg, which currently have increased to 3.6 Ah and 250 Wh/kg. The passivation of the active surfaces through the introduction of electrolyte additives has enabled the higher energy densities to be reached. Thus, a conductive membrane protects the positive active material in a similar manner to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface to protect the anode; comparison is given below:\nPrimary cell ! Alkaline Lithium iron disulfide (LiFeS2)\nLithium manganese dioxide (LiMnO2)\nSpecific energy (Wh/kg) 200 300 280\nVoltage (V) 1.5 1.5 3.3\nContinuous voltage output Low Intermediate Intermediate\nPassivation layer No, N/A Yes, moderate Yes, moderate\nOperating temperature (OT, C)\n0 < OT < 60 0 < OT < 60 30 < OT < 60\nShelf-life (SL, years) 10 15 10 < SL < 20 Note: The cathode is carbonaceous material and the anode hosts the active material\nTo achieve even higher capacities, electrode conditioning is required. Here the cell undergoes several charge-discharge cycles at a low rate (1/4 C) to decompose the additives and form the protective film. The cell is held in their charged state for a week (e.g., 0.005 V vs. Li/Li+ for 10 h, Li+ possess ultrahigh capacity [3,860 mAh g 1] and the very low standard negative electrochemical potential [ 3.040 V]) to ensure completion of the protective film. In the absence of conditioning, lithium ions can intercalate into graphite (in propylene carbonate-based electrolytes) forming a large number of active sites. These sites are formed because of nonhomogeneous voltage distribution across the anode surface due to underpotential (0 V vs. Li/Li+) during the Li+ intercalation. Areas of graphite which become exfoliated do not get\nvi Preface to Volume III on Batteries\nLi+ penetration, instead Li metal deposition occurs. This would decrease cell potential to 0.8 V and decrease the cell life cycle. The next stage of development for the 18650 type cells is the use of graphene, planar lithium-nickel-cobalt-aluminum, and nickel-manganese-cobalt cathode-type materials, in addition to new electrolyte additives to promote Li+ intercalation, suppress Li metal deposition, and promote greater homogeneity across the electrode surface. With these advances, a capacity of 3.0 Ah may be possible by focusing on nano-carbonaceous materials, improved Li+ intercalation, and use of polyanions other than oxides to increase cell voltages. These different chemistries and formulations are summarized in Table 1.\nThis book contains an overview of energy policy. Energy policy is critical to long-term planning and stability. While consumer demands related to home and travel account for 4% of the gross domestic product, they account for 28% and 41% of energy usage and CO2 emissions, respectively. Electrical storage such as LIBs has a CO2 “tax” associated with them. Only hydroelectric is CO2-neutral, although fuel cells could fall into this category, LIB, in the long run, could assist in lowering the CO2 emission profile when compared with electrical generation using coal (baseline comparison), which has been subjected to peak-load pricing and lead to increasing the efficiency of national energy resources, clean-coal development, as well as\nNote the charge and discharge temperature(s) are different; typically the battery can discharge at lower temperatures but should not be charged if frozen. Cycle life is based on the depth of discharge (DoD), where shallow DoD at moderate to cool temperatures will prolong cycle life.\nPreface to Volume III on Batteries vii\ndevelopment of sustainable resources. Lithium-ion batteries have a role to play both as portable power and as storage, where electric vehicles could be used to power homes in emergencies such as earthquakes and hurricanes when the “centralized grid” fails. The role of national energy policy vis-à-vis LIB and energy storage including recycling of lithium-ion batteries are reviewed.\nOther chapters are more traditional in offering an in-depth review of electrode materials, electrolytes, and additives for LIB, as well as indicators of the future directions for continued maturation of the LIB. Here, the authors will explicitly discuss advances in electrode design as the anatomy of the battery is the same as in Daniell’s time of anode, cathode, electrolyte, and casing/binding. The authors discuss materials composites for forming newer more reactive electrode surfaces without side reactions or dendrite formation, with higher specific capacity, energy densities, and cycling stability. The fabrication using more streamlined procedures where appropriate is discussed, including newer materials, such as antimony trioxide, chalcogens, and titanium/molybdenum disulfide as high potential anodes. Cathode materials based on nickel cobalt manganese oxide have been employed to minimize cation dissolution of the cathode materials. Other approaches include the use of layered oxides, structured materials to encapsulation designed to reduce the degree of material dissociation, particularly after prolonged use. In addition, alternative strategies related to modification of carbon nanotubes, graphite, and graphene with dopants, passivation of electrodes by coating, or alloying to enhance Li-ion diffusivity are explored. The purposes of such strategies and approaches are to minimize lithium metal deposition and to improve electrode conductivity, ionic mobility, and battery capacity during charging and discharging cycles and use.\nAll-solid-state lithium-ion batteries’ solid electrolytes, such as NASICON-type, perovskite-type, anti-perovskite type, garnet-type, sulfide-type, Li3N-type, and other chemistries, require optimal ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability at room and higher operational temperatures. These performance characteristics are discussed with respect to changes in ion mobility at different temperature regimes. The current challenges related to electrolyte selection, refinement of the interfaces, and interfacial resistance are reviewed beyond LISICON- and LiPON-type of solid electrolytes.\nRoom temperature molten salts (ionic liquids) have drawn attention for electrochemical energy storage. These systems offer excellent thermal and electrochemical stability, exhibit low volatility, and are enabled as electrolytes in batteries such as LIBs, sodium-ion, lithium-air (O2), and Li-sulfur batteries for clean energy storage. The issue of low volatility and low flammability is discussed as well as used in allsolid-state batteries to improve the conductivity of the solid electrolyte, in addition to modification of electrode materials to take advantage of the new physical and chemical properties.\nThe thermochemistry and modeling aspects are also discussed. Lithium-ion batteries’ stability is typically evaluated by cycling under a galvanostatic regime ( 1/4 C – C/2-rate) between 2.75 Vand 4.2 V for up to 250–1,500 cycles. After each completed 25n (n = 1–4) cycles, the discharge capacity, capacity loss, and average discharge potential are evaluated. Then cells undergo a supplemental charge and\nviii Preface to Volume III on Batteries\ndischarge cycle at higher C/6 rate followed by thermodynamics measurements to determine the open-circuit potential (OCP), entropy, and enthalpy values. Calculations show that state functions of entropy and enthalpy exhibit higher sensitivity to morphological changes in the electrode surface or crystal structure, such as graphite carbon-based anodes and lithium cobalt oxide cathode through repeated cycling (aging) relative to changes in Gibbs free energy estimated from the state of charge or depth of discharge, and OCP values.\nCoupled with ex situ X-ray diffractometry, electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy analyses on the electrode materials, the relationship between state functions, electrochemical output, crystal structure composition, and density of states can be assessed at both the anode and cathode during aging and inferences made using computational means of processes to stabilize the cathode and/or anode by increased graphitization during the aging process.\nThe role of non-lithium electrodes is also discussed as it is apparent that increased electric vehicle usage will deplete lithium and cobalt unless aggressive recycling, reuse, and transition to non-lithium are introduced at an early stage, as the demand for portable energy is likely to increase in the near term.\nThe general aim has been to learn how to assess the technical impact of new active materials and to increase charge density as well as operational reliability, cost, ease of use, and safety. Lastly, no book would be complete without the stellar contribution of the authors, their research group, and institutions. We also would like to extend our deep appreciation to our institution, colleagues, and students as well as the editorial staff at Springer who have strived to deliver the best possible scholarly product. As always, errors and omission are the responsibility of the editors, for which we as preface authors ask forgiveness.\nWe also wish to thank the Robert Welch Foundation (AC-0006) Award for assistance with part of the research.\nKingsville, USA Sajid Bashir August 2019 Nancy KingSanders\nJingbo Louise Liu\nPreface to Volume III on Batteries ix\nContents\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 Sajid Bashir, Nancy KingSanders, and Jingbo Louise Liu\n2 Understanding the Energy Storage Principles of Nanomaterials in Lithium-Ion Battery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 61 Weixin Song and Jun Chen\n3 Advances in Cathode Nanomaterials for Lithium-Ion Batteries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 105 Carlos M.

The increases in greenhouse gases at the present trajectory will increase the global warming potential above the 2 threshold. At this threshold, it is anticipated that climate changes will adversely affect the land and sea masses. To minimize the potential of global warming and meet the increased energy demands, high-energy capacity lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries in portable electronics and electric vehicles offer one potential solution. Current Li-ion chemistries focus on lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM), lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), and lithium titanium oxide (LTO) as cathodes and lithium metal (Li-metal) as an anode. Other semiconductor materials are used as alloying anodes (Si, Sn) that also include chalcogenides (S), metal halides (Br), and polymers. These materials enable the cell to maintain a high charge density through enhanced Li and electron transport, lesser volumetric expansion, material dissolution, and surface reactions between electrode and electrolyte generating heat. In part, battery thermal management is controlled using passive cooling in addition to liquid cooling. However, the widespread usage of Li-ion batteries in electric vehicles also presents a problem in end-of-life disposal and adverse effects on leaching of active materials into the water table. A life cycle assessment of Li material extraction and\n2 S. Bashir et al.\nusage indicates that every watt-hour (Wh) of storage capacity utilizes 328 Wh of energy and generates 110 g carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq.) emissions. The other components in the cathode, such as Ni and Co, may also pose toxicological adverse effects if released prematurely into the environment. The trend in battery design and evolution appears to indicate size and cost reduction; increased power density; recycling and transition to Li-S, Li-Air, or organic polymers to meet the anticipated energy demands; lower CO2-eq emissions; and electric vehicle demand by 2030.\nUS policy alignment on energy, transport, and the environment is rarely aligned, except for the Obama Administration attempt at Advanced Clean Coal projects [1]. US policy via the Energy Policy Act has traditionally focused on energy generation utilities which use coal and natural gas (operators) and separately transmission utilities (independent system operator, ISO). The oil crisis of the mid-1970s focused attention on hydro-, thermal-, and petroleum-ethanol blends derived from corn, biodiesel, wind, photovoltaics, and batteries related to electric vehicles. The driving force for these policy initiatives is broad, relating to air and water quality, job creation, rural development, alternative fuels, and vehicle emission policy to promote American energy independence while adhering to cleaner air initiatives that reduce the carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas footprint to lower the global warming potential below the 2 C threshold. The policy framework enacted from 1970 to 2006 followed a similar pattern with partisan optics. The members from the Democratic Party initiated more environmentalregulatory policies, while the members of the Republican Party support fossil fuel, tax incentives for grid and operators, and general tax cuts to promote job creation. During a national emergency such as oil embargo and Gulf War, the policy instruments converge, and tax incentives are used to promote research development [2] with the State enacting more regulatory push, particularly from the 1990s. Therefore entities in energy or automakers have volunteerism through federal incentives and compulsion through state regulation. The policies enacted at the state and federal level involved different coalitions with different policies and decision-making priorities but can be broadly classified into four groups.\nInnovation and transportation technologies are often misunderstood, and their impact is overstated, leading to cost overruns. This might account for the evolution of the nuclear, clean coal, and solar industries which held promise of a near unlimited energy supply at low cost with low risk, but the actual rollout was quite different since there was no common agreement on adaptation of a specific technology platform, technical ignorance of policymakers, and uncertainty on how quickly early technologies would be adopted by the market [3].\nFrom the 1970s, sustainable policies were added to existing fossil fuel-orientated policy, rather than aligned from the ground up [4]. This interplay is observed with the policy implementation of net metering and solar PV, which many coal and gas utilities failed to challenge because they underestimate the negative impact these policies would have on their fossil fuel business model. Likewise, policymakers did not design these policies to meet a specific challenge, e.g., foster energy independence, but to promote an\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 3\numbrella of policies that would foster change without changing the current fossil fuelbased businesses. The corn-ethanol blend in petroleum likewise was rolled out as a minor component that was insufficient to meet the policy goals of self-sufficiency and was crafted to allay the fears of the petroleum industry that their profits would not be affected through the introduction of blended and alternative fuels [5]. Once it becomes apparent that some of the policies would lead to revenue loss, the dominant industries resorted to lobbying and lawsuits. The political and financial cost of these policies in terms of tax rebates and payments to the consumer also led to greater pushback from the legislature, in the form of revised legislation. For example, Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) ethanol from cellulose and biofuel ramp up and California’s Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate were scaled back because of increased costs in terms of tax rebates for implementation of the technology to market [6]. These policies, often rolled in as add-ons to mainstream bills or as omnibus bills, are a demonstration that a common federal energy policy has not existed that tied need/want to ability and long-term planning but enabled policymakers to pass legislation that was perceived as difficult or not passing in stand-alone bills. Examples include addition of the Federal Production Tax Credit (PTC) to the 1992 Energy Policy Act or the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) in the 2015 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The main focus of these bills was the use of federal lands for mineral and oil exploitation and the introduction of vehicle fuel economy standards, not electric vehicle (EV) tax exceptions.\nIn many of the omnibus bills, a cap or sunset provision was added to limit political blowback on “unflavored policies,” which enabled renewable energy policy to be advocated as a minor component within an omnibus energy bill that focused on fossil fuels, regulations, and standards rather than a comprehensive energy transition policy to meet the goals of energy independence. Thereby, introduction components placed favorable opportunities piecemeal through Congress rather than as one major component. For this reason, many sustainable policies once introduced underwent incremental increases in either delay of the expiration or increase of the initial state scope or goal. One example was the modest introduction of 50 MW of electricity from solar to be deployed back into the grid that was followed by new standards, ITCs, and growth in solar PV deployment [7] and investment (during the Obama Administration) from beginning at least two decades earlier. Currently, with the Trump Administration, it appears these subsidies may be removed or roll backed. The policy related to batteries in EVs similarly began with California’s ZeroEmission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate which included a sunset provision, which was extended through incremental bills, because of the greater lobbying power of these nascent industries at the initial introduction. Fossil fuel tax credits that have been maintained since the Wilson Administration (1916, known as “depletion allowance,” which lets oil producers deduct 27.5% of their gross revenues) have been equivalent to more than a $500 billion rebate, while in contrast the tax incentives to the sustainable sector have had more uncertainty because of the provision of sunset clauses [8]. The expansion of renewables such as wind and solar and associated tax incentives has escalated costs and drawn political ire from fiscal conservatives to\n4 S. Bashir et al.\nminimize subsidies. A policy to foster innovation and technological maturity with a pilot to scale up deployment and cost of rebate at specific milestones of deliverables has not been attempted with political and policy costs associated, whereby policymakers are more risk-averse if a particularly favored policy or project had previously failed to meet expectations [9].\nAn example of the above paradox is net metering, where the consumer receives the same rate for electricity as a provider. The utility companies have objected since the consumer does not have infrastructure or grid costs except the solar panel, whereas solar panel or energy providers support parity since the consumer is providing energy that can be used elsewhere [10]. The RPS mandates have also been criticized by utility operators, who perceive this standard as advocating a specific technology. The tax exemptions were extended when the industry was less than 1% of the entire petroleum industry. However when the biofuels blend became a more significant market force, drawing profits away from petroleum companies, lobbying against further tax exceptions greatly amplified. The policymakers sought to defray criticism from the petroleum industry by converting the gasohol tax exemption into a tax credit, the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit (VEETC) which expired in 2012. A similar trend can be seen with EV tax credits, which when EV sales were less than 200,000 nationally received little criticism from autoand policymakers, but now EV have sales in the lower 800,000 with project costs of two million by 2020, so many states have allowed the initial rebates to expire. The transition to a sustainable energy mix requires federal and state policy to consider wind, solar, thermal nuclear, and appropriate energy storage technologies in addition to infrastructure and reconstruction to the transmittance grid, cleaner coal-based fuels, examples of ethanol blend past 10%, and risk and environmental factors. Policymakers must take account of the possible failure of some technologies to meet the policy framework of independence from foreign oil, lower greenhouses gas emissions, and creation of American jobs with lower taxation for utility operators and energy providers including mineral and oil exploration and exploitation.\n1.1 Possible Battery and Electric Vehicle Road Map from 1970 to 2050\nIf renewable portfolio standards (RPS)-type mandates are extended including investment tax credits (ITCs), the current market momentum will carry lithium-ion batteries to 70% in portable electronics and mobility by 2030 with the global market for Li-ion batteries doubling to tripling, depending on the market model. The batteries in transportation will range from bicycles, scooters, and mopeds to mini, full-size sedans as well as buses and stationary applications both on-grid and off-grid storage. Market saturation will not occur for some time, because of limitations of electrically propelled vehicle endurance. The miles-per-gallon equivalence (mpge) is still lower than internal combustion engine (ICE)-based vehicles. This would be reflected in the popularity of the\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 5\nhybrid automobile, where the ICE powers the automobile at higher speeds and an electric motor coupled with capacitor/generator at lower city speeds. It is estimated by 2030, almost 70% of the automobiles will still be ICE-based.\nTo ramp up production, battery technology will need to change to greater performance/price and a nearly exponential increase in worldwide battery production to meet the anticipated demand. The trends in the road map (Fig. 1.1) demonstrate using past trends and current US policy over the next decade for battery improvements with respect to anode design, new materials for cathode, energy density, increased life cycle, and increased safety, with the lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry being dominant by 2020 and siliconbased lithium-ion batteries by 2030, as well as Li-sulfur (Li-S), Li-air, and other Li-alkaline earth metal or organic polymer derivative nano-engineered (Li+eng) batteries in the mix, with the Li4Ti5O12 (LTO, 175 mAh/g), lead-acid (Pb Acid) being relevant for stationary applications. While nickel-cadmium (NiCd) and nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) have given away to Li-ion batteries in portable electronic applications, they will retain a minor share in low-energy electronics\n6 S. Bashir et al.\nand detectors. Material costs are another major hurdle to overcome before mass market flow can be accomplished since about 65% of the final cost is related to the active material (intercalation of lithium). By moving to phosphorous, silicon, and organic-based nanomaterials, these costs can be reduced by 30% per kWh. The $100/kWh should also be reached by 2025, for Si and NMC battery chemistries. It is also likely that ITC will no longer be offered, as the lower battery pack will lead to a lowering of the price of electric vehicles since at present the battery is the largest single unit cost within an electric vehicle.\nThe policy will revise alternative fuel and car emission standards if ZEV-type mandates are considered, giving rise to liquefied natural gas as a fuel for trucks, to 10%, 15% and 85% ethanol blends (E10, E15, and E85). It is likely that further legislation will be crafted to take account of electric vehicle (EV) emissions, not from the tail pipe but in the generation of electricity to charge these vehicles, as charging becomes more widespread. Other less mature technologies like fuel cell (FC) vehicles are charged using off-grid photovoltaics (PV) or on-board photovoltaics, such as solar transitions from fragile panels to flexible polymers, where the automobile paint or color scheme may have residual PV capacity to charge the car while it is idle or parked. Other hybrid combinations of fuel cells to electric vehicles (FC-EV) include the current internal combustion engine (ICE)-electric stack-based vehicles (ICE-EV). Fuel cells like EV cars require energy, the most ecological of which is hydrogen (H2); however, hydrogen needs to be generated and requires energy. If photovoltaics/solar is used to electrolyze water to hydrogen and oxygen, these gases can be recombined chemically to generate electricity; therefore the next generation of hybrids could be electric vehicle-fuel cells (EV-FC). If fuel cells become more widespread, refueling with hydrogen, like charging stations, will be required. These charging stations could use water to generate hydrogen and oxygen using grid electricity (such as natural gas, coal) or could use sustainable energy in the form of solar that is stored at the refueling station using batteries which are consumed during hydrogen production. Alternatively, solar power could be used for electrolysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen which are inputs for the fuel cell to generate electricity and water as outputs. This would be a form of onboard hydrogen storage and usage (onboard H2-FC). Much historic legislation has been passed to preserve the fossil fuel industry via incremental increases as various technological-driven technologies become more widespread. The ability to fabricate all-electric vehicles with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) for the first time yields the possibility of selfdrive, self-park automobiles. Because of the scarcity of these models, there is no legislation to address the technical and legal (liability) issues, but as cars transition to digital, the cockpit will incorporate AI features to replace human error. It is likely laws will be crafted to address AI in transport, as well as battery safety and taxation, as the transport sector transitions to mostly ICE-based to mostly EV-FC-based. It is also plausible to tie increased abundance of EVs to\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 7\nnewer CO2 emissions that incorporated generation of energy materials. Instead of CO2 per tank, newer rules will be based on CO2 net weight of the vehicle which in turn takes account of the raw materials and fabrication CO2 “costs.” This, in turn, may lead to more streamlined vehicles that have less CO2 generated (based on extraction, milling, moldings, fabrication, and energy consumption to manufacture the component) instead of combustion of gasoline. Lastly, like safety standards in gasoline stations, equivalent standards in hydrogen refueling or battery swap station/recharging stations are also anticipated."

      "text" : "Societal needs change, and to understand the role of portable power, such as lithium-ion batteries, it is necessary to understand how and why we have arrived at this juncture.\nIn the United Kingdom, during the mid-eighteenth century, the mix of technology and innovation led to the first industrial revolution [11].), where for the first time, mass production and consolidation of expertise were housed in specific locations [12]. The cog that connects the import of raw materials, the housing of workers, and the actual operation of machinery and factories was steam and electricity, steam for transportation in addition to the use of inland waterways (canal) and electricity for lighting and operation of machinery [13]. The world population at this time (1780) was approximately 850 million, and today (2018) it is estimated at 7.8 billion with an estimated increase to 11.2 billion by 2100 (Roser and Ritchie 2018) as shown in Fig. 1.2. This rise will increase both economic growths and require additional energy [14]. The International Energy Outlook and other sources estimate the world primary energy demand in 1800 was 0.48 billion ton of oil equivalent (t.o.e), whereas today it is 13.9 billion (t.o.e) and anticipated to rise to 18.5 billion by 2040 under the new policy scenario (Roser and Ritchie 2018; [16]), summarized in Fig. 1.3 [17].\n8 S. Bashir et al.\nBurning carbon-based fuels to generate electricity or movement, including heat, generates carbon dioxide which contributes toward global temperature fluctuation as a greenhouse gas (GHG) [18]. World energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions rose from 33.9 billion metric tons in 2015 to 39.3 billion metric tons in 2040, an increase of 16% over that period [24]. This trend has mirrored the rise in primary energy demand from approximately 6647 million t.o.e (1983 = 100%) to a 39%\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 9\nincrease by 2000 or 100% in 2018, while the sum of non-carbon-emitting sources of energy remained constant during the same time period [21] as illustrated in Fig. 1.4. The continued sum rise (although the percent rate has slowed) has resulted in the more cumulative release of GHGs of which carbon dioxide is by volume the largest component [25]. This emission will increase from approximately 30 gigatons per year to 140 if no action is taken, modeled as business as usual (BAU), intended nationally determined contribution (INDC, [26]). The INDC is modeled with no continued improvement after the target data (strict) [27] or continued improved (continue) after the INDC target date 2025 (United States) or 2030 (most countries) are approaches to tackling GHG emissions [28]. It appears that while the carbon dioxide emission rate and overall CO2 levels will drop, they will not drop sufficiently to limit global temperature fluctuations by 2 C, which most models predict will adversely affect global weather patterns [29]. Therefore some countries have adopted a stricter plan above INDC in an attempt to lower CO2 emissions sufficient to meet the 2 C [30] as plotted in Fig. 1.5. These are as a result of combustion of liquid, solid, and gaseous fuels in a number of industries [35] and shown in Fig. 1.6 [41]. The tonnage emission of GHG has closely paralleled CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere (Dlugokencky and Tans 2017) and shown in Fig. 1.7. The percent of CO2 emissions attributed to energy generation (59%), transport (16%), and commercial and residual (9.8%) in 2010 of 34.42 million gigagrams of CO2 [45, 46] indicates that transition of the transportation and stationary power systems sector from a carbon-intensive regime to a low-carbon regime, such as battery power (electron economy), can decrease CO2 emissions, in addition, to extend natural resources, summarized in Fig. 1.8."

The percent share of oil has averaged 40% (1966–2013), although over the last decade (2006–2016), it has averaged 33% [21] because of improvements in materials (strength and weight) and reduction of friction in\nautomobiles [50]. With material substitution, streamlined design to generate less friction [51], automobile gasoline consumption is anticipated to drop by 10–20% [52, 53], and rechanneling breaking energy loss because of heat and friction can extend efficiencies and lower dependence on gasoline [54] in automobiles. Heat loss via the exhaust and mechanical losses represent over 70% of the measured losses, and newer developments in the internal combustion engine (ICE) can further extend efficiencies [55] in addition to improvements in recovery of waste heat to work thermoelectric subsystems [56]."

      "text" : "In an electric vehicle, the electric motor replaces the ICE for traction and a flywheel or battery as the energy source. The drivetrain consists of three subsystems, the electric motor (EM), energy pack (B), and auxiliary or secondary power unit (SPU). The motor subsystem is further comprised of a controller unit (CU), the power converter (PU), the electric motor, mechanical transmission (T), and wheels. The energy system contains the battery pack (or flywheel, supercapacitor or fuel cell), energy management unit (EMU), and refueling/recharging assembly. The auxiliary contains the power steering (PS), climate control (CC), and secondary power unit. The control unit channels inputs from the accelerator or braking subsystems to the electric converter to regulate power flow between energy pack and electric motor including reverse power flow because of regenerative braking. This procedure results in energy recovery and efficiency gains. This enables the vehicle to be configured into a number of different conformations with integration and simplification of the drive train. In one configuration the axles point at drive wheels that contain the traction motor, enabling each motor to operate inner wheels at one speed and outer wheels at a different speed when taking corners. Alternatively, the tractionmotor can be placed inside a wheel (IW), where a gear is used to reduce the motor speed and increase motor torque to provide a responsive reduction ratio [57]. Lastly, an inline configuration of the input and output shaft can also be employed to streamline the mechanical transmission where the out-rotor and in-wheel are connected, thereby eliminating the mechanical gear transmission assembly [58]; therefore the speed control of the motor directs the wheel speed [60] and summarized in Fig. 1.9 [59].\nWhile electric vehicles have the potential to displace ICE-based vehicles in the long term, the performance of battery systems such as energy or power density, charging rate, cycle lifetime, and endurance is not to the same level as with ICEs. The employment of nanomaterials has enabled power profiles to be improved and appear to be within reach at 250 Wh/kg at a full time to charge 3 h are within reach [61]. The cost of a vehicle battery is $ 100 kWh by 2030 [62].\nWith the US Department of Energy recommendation of a driving range of 500 km, a specific energy of 250–350 Wh/kg would be required [63]. Therefore the selection of the battery is not a critical parameter but does have a bearing on performance and cost. Two parameters used to evaluate the type of battery are massenergy density (kWh/kg) and volumetric energy density (kWh/m3) with different batteries exhibiting different profiles."

The battery supplies power to the starter and ignition system to start the engine. They also supply the extra power necessary when the vehicle’s electrical load exceeds the supply from the charging system. A car battery acts as a voltage stabilizer in the electrical system. The battery evens out voltage spikes and prevents them from damaging other components in the electrical system. In smaller powered engines, the battery powers the motor that drives an electric vehicle, such as a forklift truck or wheelchair. These batteries have no memory and can be configured either as\ndeep cycle mode for boats or campers, where they are used to power accessories like trolling motors, winches, or lights, or as standby to supply electrical power to critical systems in the event of a power outage or automotive or motive uses. However, they have a short life cycle and lower specific energy and power.\nNickel-cadmium (NiCd) have a low-energy weight ratio but have the highest life span (charge/discharge cycle of 1500); however like Pb, Cd is a heavy metal that is toxic to wildlife and mammals [75].

This can be partially offset by running the battery through very deep discharge cycles.\nNickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) have a high load capacity and high discharge coefficient [76]. They also suffer from a slight memory effect and are used in devices that require a high power such as cameras and flashes.\nLithium-ion (Li+) have a large power storage capacity with intermediate energy density/weight ratio but have a lower life cycle, are prone to overheating, and are expensive. Lithium-ion polymer extends the life cycle of Li+ [77] but is also not as stable as PbA.

The cathode is not lithium metal but lithium metal oxides, while the anode is graphite and dimethyl carbonates containing dissolved lithium salts [84].\nThe charging and discharging cycles of the battery occur between the anode and cathode via the electrolyte. During charging of the ions from the cathode (Li metal oxide) to the anode (graphite), the discharge cycle occurs in the reverse direction [85].

Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) has high specific energy and can run up to 1000 full cycles, yielding a consumer life span of 2–3 years. Heat is a major disadvantage because of the presence of cobalt oxide which has a low thermal stability. If the battery is overcharged or is left in sunlight and heats up, it short circuits. The excessive heat can decompose the metal casing and metal oxide, because the instability of lithium in air shown in Eqs. 1.12, 1.13, 1.14, and 1.15 is positive and therefore spontaneous.\nO2 gð Þ þ 4Hþ aqð Þ þ 4e ! 2 H2O lð Þ 1½ E∘ ¼ þ1:229 V (1:12) Liþ þ e !

A major safety concern is overheating [97]. In sensor technology, NMC and NCA cells are utilized because of lower material intensity but with good specific energy. In hybrid electric vehicles, a conventional internal combustion engine with an electric propulsion system is used to drive the vehicle. Here the power recovery from deceleration is stored in the battery for future use during acceleration. The electric system, therefore, is more auxiliary and as a result has a power of 2–3 kWh, insufficient for overnight charging. These types of vehicles do not have a plug-in port for recharging. Cars with 8 kWh or larger batteries require a separate plug-in port to charge the battery. This power is sufficient for an all-electric drive of 30 km, with the load being born by the ICE. In an EV, the ICE is replaced by an electric motor and requires energies of 18 kWh for a drive of 120 km [98]. The EV market is dominated by the NMC (higher lifetime)- and NCA (higher specific energy)-type Li batteries, because of their high specific energy or life cycle. The plug-in vehicle prefers the NMC type, while the EV prefer the NCA. The average ICE car can drive up to 310 miles on a 12-gallon tank, which takes 5 min to refill. The PbA batteries typically have a 3–8-year warranty, usually prorated after the third year. In comparison, the plug-in batteries have a warranty of 100 k miles or 3 years and EV 500–800 cycles or 8 years. However, the plug-in cannot currently drive 310 miles on a full charge or be recharged within 5 min. The current lifetime warranty is less than the possible endurance of these batteries since a 310 mile/ cycle at 800 full cycles would travel 248 k miles, well as the warranty period. It, therefore, appears that specific energies around 80 kWh and weight are pressing\n20 S. Bashir et al.\ntechnical concerns to make automobile performance (drive and refilling) to be on par with gasoline-powered cars [99]. Other related sectors include electric motorcycles, and bicycles, and forklifts that use a mix of LFP-LMO battery chemistries.\nThe engine power to specific energy (E) capacity of the electric vehicles also needs to be taken into account. The current ratio is between 3 and 5 for EVand 5 and 10 for plug-ins. It is unlikely this ratio may get larger with increases in specific energy and more efficient electric motors, summarized in Table 1.5 [100].\nFor this reason, global car sales reached a milestone in 2015 (one million units sold) and are the fastest-growing area in the automotive market today (Fig. 1.13) [102]. Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts that by 2038 the major type of car sold would be the electric vehicle as opposed to the ICE and by 2040 just under 60 million units will be sold, although there will still be over 1.2 billion ICE cars still in operation BNEF [105]."

The electricity demand is not constant but varies by time of day or seasonal or special event such as sports, music, and political events, where audience members at home use electricity for drinks and food during break time of the program or event. In addition, severe weather can affect heating or cooling in offices and households. These variations affect how electricity is generated (coal, nuclear, wind, solar, or gas), and restrictions are placed by grid regulators to ensure no utility operator is near their maximum capacity [106]. Therefore for a steady output, the grid utilizes energy\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 21\nstorage units to offset against peak demand via pumped hydro storage. Over the last decade, there has been a slow shift toward more renewable energy mixes such as photovoltaics and wind [107], resulting in decentralization where end-users can input energy into the grid as well as draw energy out [108]. This, in turn, has drawn attention to improved energy efficiency at all levels to lower the total electricity usage and lower carbon dioxide emissions [109]. Electrochemical storage, therefore, can play a critical role in the infrastructure of low carbon buildings [110], where Li-ion batteries have advantages over other electrochemical storage strategies. One disadvantage is the Li battery bank storage is more expensive at approximately $350/kWh with a lifetime of 2000 cycles. A cost of less than $175/kWh with a lifetime above 3000 cycles will place storage costs in the c$5/kWh range and make them competitive toward centralized and distributed power storage units [111]. Here the units could be used to maximize local usage of electricity from distributed renewable power generation units such as windmills that are local to each community of 20 houses [112]. The battery chemistry most favored under these circumstances is related to LFP, vanadium redox, and PbA batteries [113]. A side effect of the millions of units of EVs is the possibility of these vehicles serving as backup distributed units (vehicle-to-grid) in emergencies (hurricanes) where constant power is critical (hospital, care homes, office blocks, police, fire, emergency services) or even as a backup source for home residents who can sell the power during peak hours and recharge at off-peak hours [114].\nLithium-ion batteries can also be employed as electrochemical storage for an off-grid power supply such as with renewables, which is dominated by PbA batteries. Under a renewable-powered home (RPH), the battery can be placed inside the house if it is powered using photovoltaics or a windmill that is close by Jaiswal [115]. The battery packs could power the basic heating/cooling/lighting\nfunction of an RPH by 2030 [108]. This has distinct advantages of gasoline or kerosene generators or heating sources since the prices of these fuels fluctuate more than the price of light-emitting diodes (for lighting) or LFP for storage [116]. This is attractive to societies with poor infrastructure since a national grid system would not be necessary. Each community could have their battery bank supplied by a windmill or solar panels centrally located (light harvesting farm) or on each building [117]."

The trend is illustrated in Table 1.6.\nThe Li-ion battery demand for portable electronics is growing at an average annual rate of 10%. The Li-ion battery demand for portable electronics is likely to reach 45 GWh in 2020 and 100 GWh in 2030.

Most auto manufacturers buy the cell but assemble their own battery packs, the cost of which is rolled into the vehicle, for example, a $3700 Tesla (10 kWh NCA) battery pack, the cell of which is purchased at $470/kWh [118]. As the EV and laptop batteries include, the cost reductions toward a 5 kWh pack at <$1000 are practical in price/performance and market saturation perspectives. As the magnitude of Li batteries increases, not all Li battery chemistries will be increased. The long-term stability of LFP and specific energies of NCA types will increase at the expense of LMO. NiMH and NiCD are expected to decrease significantly, although PbA because of their proven record in stationary and motive applications will remain a strong contender for usage. With Tesla’s proposed Gigafactory and the cheaper material costs of LFP batteries, the two dominant platforms are expected to be LFP and\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 23\nLMO for a market share up to 2030. As the number of Li-ion batteries increases, so does the population of batteries that have reached the end of life (power< 80%) and recycling becomes significant or repacking as batteries for storage [120]."

      "text" : "The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has set a number of industrywide standards that can be utilized in developing a life cycle assessment (LCA) model to understand both energy and material costs. The relevant standards pertain to ISO 14040 (Principles and Framework), ISO 14041 (Goal and Scope definition), ISO 14042 (Inventory analysis), and ISO 14043 (Impact analysis) and summarized in Fig. 1.14.\nThe LCA has been applied to investigate the gaseous emissions relationship in hybrid vehicles related to battery size [121]. The fuel mix to generate electricity for charging was also investigated in terms of creating a carbon neutral environment [122]. A study on the lifetime driving of an EV (93 k miles) demonstrated that global warming potential could further decrease from 10% to 24% with the substitution of ICE by EV resulting in lowered gasoline consumption [123]. The availability of EVs has led to companies generating more electricity from sustainable resources, and the fewer components resulted in fewer materials in the product chain [124]. When hybrid cars are compared using LCA, the global warming potential was 27% [125]. A simulated model incorporating design elements from LCA based on Pareto set points and a proprietary algorithm demonstrated that NiMH offered optimal fuel economy and Li-ion batteries the lowest operating cost and greatest global warming potential reduction relative to PbA [126].

      "text" : "Recycling is cost-effective since it minimizes the more energy-intensive extraction of raw materials process. Typically for batteries, the metals are recovered via smelting and refining. From this process transition metals such as cobalt, nickel, and manganese are recovered and can be reutilized in the car. Lithium and rare earth elements reside in the slag and are used as a building material in roadbeds and pavements. An alternative approach to recover rare earth is by leaching, which will become more paramount as the number of Li-ion cells that are at the end of life becomes significant, which is anticipated in the next decade [127].\nLCA has also been applied to public and urban transport platforms such as buses, in which battery type, weight, specific energy, and traffic conditions are factors that affect the environment [128].\nThe LCA model has general ramifications that can apply to all industries, where decarbonization targets the reduction of global warming potential requiring rare earth and transition metals such as dysprosium, neodymium, cobalt, tin, nickel, and manganese. In addition to Li-ion batteries, metal oxides or salts of lithium are required [129]. These resources are not available uniformly and are concerned in a few regions. This requires manufacturers to strike long-term price agreements and researchers to transition to more available materials, in addition to ramping up recycling efforts [130] (Table 1.7).\nLithium is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl(Si2O5)2, lepidolite K(Li, Al)3(Al, Si, Rb)4O10(F, OH)2, spodumene LiAl(SiO3)2, and also subsurface brines. Chile and Australia are the world’s largest producers of lithium with their combined production being greater than 75% of the world’s production [135]. In brine, it is in the form of lithium chloride, which, when treated with soda ash (sodium carbonate, Na2CO3), precipitates into lithium carbonate [136]. Almost 80% of extracted lithium is from brine. In 2015, 65,108 tons of lithium carbonate were extracted [137] with 39% being used in the batteries sector, 30% in ceramics and glass, 8% in lubricating greases, 5% in polymer production, 5% in casting mold flux powders, and 13% others. The consumption for lithium in the battery sector has increased from 20,026 tons in 2008 to 77,821 tons in 2016, an almost quadrupling over 8 years [138]. The estimated battery storage capacity between 2020 and 2030 is approximately 2.5 TWh. This capacity translates to approximately 400,000 of lithium carbonate at 0.16 kg/kWh or almost 3% of the global reserve. If recycling, factored in other metals such as cobalt, can be recovered [120], it is now part of the framework incorporating LCA [139]. The average life cycle of Li-ion batteries in portable electronics is 5 years; for automotive applications, it is 12 years; and in power supply and storage, it is 10 years. The lithium recovery percentage is dependent on\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 25\nthe type of battery and system and varies from 80% for electronics to 95% for automotive/power systems. At present approximately 60%, ~30%, and <10% of recycled lithium are reused in the newer system, meaning on average, 40% of lithium is recycled into new components. Unfortunately, there is no systematic or uniform back distribution system, where end-users can return the spent batteries [140] and most batteries end up in disposal sites or landfills in the United States at end of life [141].\nLithium usually does not bioaccumulate in humans and its environmental toxicity is low [142]. Lithium is not an essential element for plants although it does stimulate plant growth [143]. Lithium has been used to treat bipolar disorder even though excessive doses can be fatal. For example, 10 mg/L in serum is the recommended treatment regime; however, patients that have taken more exhibit the signs of elemental poisoning (10 mg/L of blood). At higher (15 mg/L) doses, patients exhibit confusion and slurred speech that becomes fatal at 20 mg/L [144]. A provisional recommended daily intake of 14.3 μg/kg body weight lithium for an adult has been suggested [145]. To put these figures in context, 1 g/L alcohol will give the average individual symptoms of slurred speech, and 3–4 g/L (9 μg/kg) is considered fatal [146]. Lithium will undergo price volatility over the next decade as the newer longterm contracts are renewed or older mines close down. In glass manufacturing, other Alkali metal such as potassium and sodium can replace lithium in glass and ceramics, and calcium and aluminum can be used in lubricating greases [147], at present assuming $140/kWh, with lithium material intensity at 0.15 kg/kWh and $13,900 per metric ton (2017). This price is almost double the price from 2016. The\n26 S. Bashir et al.\npercent of lithium in a battery pack and price influence is <1.5%; therefore price fluctuation in the raw materials is unlikely to affect electronics or automakers.\nCobalt is mined in Canada and Morocco but also is recovered as a by-product of copper or nickel production from mines in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Russian Federation, Australia, and Cuba in the form of minerals cobaltite and smaltite (cobalt arsenide). Other cobalt-bearing minerals include erythrite, glaucodot, and linnaeite (cobalt sulfide) [148]. The Congo supply approximately 54% of the global demand (64,000 metric tons). Cobalt is used as a cathode material in Li-ion batteries and also in alloys and cemented carbides [149], in addition to being an essential nutritional element. Approximately 30% of the globally extracted cobalt is utilized by the Li battery sector [148]. Unlike Li, the share of Co to the final cell price is significant. Assuming $140/kWh, with lithium material intensity at 1.4 kg/kWh $81,000/ton (from $30,000 in 2017), the cost share of cobalt in the cell is 81%. For NMC and NCA cells, that share would be <10%. In these cases, price fluctuations could affect battery-pack prices in EVs. This critical need can be addressed by recycling and using cobalt-free cathodes with similar specific energies. Recycling could salvage up to 50% of the cobalt [150], and implementation of cobalt-free chemistries in LFP type, stationary storage, and alternates to cobalt in alloys and structures could also extend its usage [151].\nOther less likely shortages are because of nickel and graphite, although these are not as critical as with cobalt [152]. Approximately 1.2 million tons of graphite is mined annually of which 3% is directed to the Li-ion battery sector [148]. The concern is that 65% of the mines are in China. The current mining of nickel is 2.25 million tons over the Philippines (22%), Russian Federation (11%), and Canada (11%) [148] and its use for metal alloys and in NMC, NCA, NiMH, and NiCd batteries, of which 3% is devoted to the battery sector. Li-ion batteries are classified as hazardous because of their lead (6.29> 5 mg/L), cobalt (0.16 kg> 0.008), copper (0.0987 > 0.0025 kg/kg), and nickel (0.0095 > 0.002) content. The disposal of batteries in landfills often led to leaching of chromium, lead, and thallium leading to eco and human toxicity particularly for Co, Cu, Ni, Th, and Ag [153]."

      "heading" : "1.13 The Next Evolution of Li Battery Development Technology",
      "text" : "The design of batteries has remained constant over the last 100 years with two electrodes, a conducting electrolyte and separator. The electrons move accordingly to the electrochemical potential difference between the electrodes, as a function of their unique chemistries via an external circuit from the more negative to the more positive potential. Ions are transported through the electrolyte/separator to maintain charge balance, and electrical energy is used. In rechargeable batteries, a reverse applied voltage pushes the electrons in the opposite direction. The magnitude of the electrical energy per mass is related to the cells voltage and capacity which in turn is related to cell chemistry.\nThe chemical to electrical potential can be enhanced by engineering a larger chemical potential difference between the electrodes, decreasing the volume of the\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 27\nreactants per exchanged electron, and maintaining the electrolyte (e.g., for NiMH and Li-ion batteries).\nIn the lithium-ion battery, Li+ participates at both electrodes, being either inserted or extracted from the appropriate electrode. Lithium is attractive because of its high specific capacity (3860 mAh/g) and low redox potential (~ 3.0 V SHE). Here Li+ is exchanged between the anode consisting of graphite (LixC6) and transition metal oxides as a cathode (Li1 xTMO2). The transition metal oxides are cobalt, nickel, or manganese. This system can store up to 180 Wh/kg with an output of 3.8 V, much greater than lead-acid (PbA) batteries. While electric vehicles (EV) do not produce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at the tailpipe, the manufacturer of an EV and/or power source is not carbon-free. Approximately 70 kg COs/kWh is produced [154]. The breakpoint where EV become carbon neutral related to the power cell is approximately 120 charges (with 35% efficiency from the production of electricity from coal and 20% for an ICE), not in itself sufficient to lower the global warming potential by 2 , a suggested target. The next generation of batteries (Fig. 1.15) will need to increase specific energy and lower the carbon footprint.\nThe initial increase of electrode surface area leads to increased reactions with electrolyte resulting in electrolyte decomposition. However, when the active cathode material is intercalated between graphites, the secondary oxidation or reduction reactions were greatly reduced [155]. By carefully placing the TMO between layers of carbon, the kinetics are optimized, because of lower diffusion path for ions and electrons. Through careful adjustment of the packing plane or lattice, metal insertion or conversion can be achieved [156]. In metal insertion the local covalency and density of states of a semiconductor such as titania (TiO2) are altered through the careful addition of metal or metal oxide, enabling the band gap to be lowered or increased [157]. In conversion, the TMO is converted to metal (xM0) nanowire-type morphology embedded within the MO (e.g., Li2O2, Fig. 1.16). If the conversion “islands” are not controlled, there will be a large voltage difference between the charge and discharge modes, resulting in poor energy efficiency.\nSimilarly, nanodesign has been applied to solid electrolytes such as Al2O3 or TiO2 dispersed in polymers for fabrication of polyether-based electrolytes to increase conductivity at higher temperatures (80 C). Another approach to increasing conductivity is through local ordering using co-block polymeric fibers [159]. Since the hydrophobic and phase separation can be better controlled, this is one approach to optimize the specific energy of the battery. Ionic liquids that have low vapor pressures, which are nonflammable and have high conductivities, will enable batteries without thermal runaway to be fabricated and can potentially assist with overheating, although cost and low-temperature performance have not been demonstrated on par with current technologies.\nSince lithium and cobalt are the limiting factors in terms of scale-up and resource allocations, the transition to cobalt-free and recycling of bio-batteries are potential solutions to scarce resources.\nThe most precise control at the biological level is deoxyribonuclease and protein synthesis that is templated and enzymatically driven to generate precise and wellordered systems. The enzyme-mediated synthesis of LiFePO4 cathodes would solve\n28 S. Bashir et al.\nmany problems related to ordering and scarce resources [160] where virus or bacterium has been used to engineer Co3O4- and MnO2-based electrodes, respectively.\nMany systems also employ iron-sulfur or iron storage in the form of apoferritin (protein without iron) and ferritin (with iron) [161]. Mimetic polymers could serve as\ntemplates to chelate iron adsorbed on the surface of a conversion electrode to control the deposition/dissolution of TMxOy and Li2O crystals. Other approaches include the use of chemically active conjugative molecules like polyaniline [162] or redox polymers [163, 164] and sugars that can chelate lithium [C6H12O6]n + 2nLi\n+ 2nē -> C6H10O5Li2 + 2 H\n+ [165]. Since carbohydrates and polyketones are structurally related, they could be used for the design of biocompatible electrodes [166]."

Because of the large activation energy, in fuel cells, platinum is used to overcome this barrier and facilitate catalysis. Porous 3D electrodes can separate gas (N2, CO2) or water away from either Li or Li2O2 to increase the energy efficiency, and ionic liquids that are hydrophobic will reduce water entry and contamination of the electrode surface, although at present hydrophobic ionic liquids and hygroscopic lithium salts have low compatibility and solubility.\nLithium as an anode has been deposited unevenly forming dendritic structures that lead to low efficiencies and overheating, because of passivation of the outer layer of lithium metal [168]. The application of dry polymer electrolytes has reduced but not eliminated passivation of lithium. This is for two reasons: (1) high fermi energy resulting in thermodynamic instability promoting reactions with electrolyte and passivation and (2) generation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers, in addition to consumption of electrolyte resulting in increased internal resistance and lowered cycle life. The high volumetric aspect ratio of Li metal at the anode during periodic plating and stripping processes causes dendritic to be formed and lower efficiency."

      "text" : "Strategies to reduce dendrite growth are via optimization of the electrolytes. If co-additives that promote uniform morphology are added, dendrite formation can be minimized. One example is the use of cesium hexafluorophosphate (CsPF6) in propylene carbonate (PC), resulting in the formation of a smooth Li film with well-ordered nanorods on the copper substrate. The copper surface is passivated by lithium fluoride (LiF) in situ from the reduction of PF6\nand the shielding effect of Cs+ [169]. Other approaches include the growth of Li nanorods in 1 M LiPF6/PC electrolyte and trace (50 ppm) water [170]. The hydrolysis of LiPF6 generated HF which was electrochemically reduced to LiF prior to deposition of Li, from the LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Cu substratum without an increase in Li Coulombic efficiency. With 2% LiAsF6 and 2%, vinylene carbonate (VC) or fluoroethylene carbonate were added to 1 M LiPF6/PC electrolyte, smooth Li deposition with highly ordered Li nanorods were obtained, and Coulombic efficiency was increased to 96.5% [171] with the electrochemical reduction of LiAsF6 to LiF and LixAs. Here, LiF passivated the substrate, and LixAs was seed species for the growth of Li. The electrolyte VC or fluoroethylene carbonate was polymerized that bound the inorganic compounds and adhered to the Li metal surface, protecting the Li metal anode and cycle stability of the cell [172]. A similar approach used 4 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LfSI) in 1,2-dimethoxyethane [173]. The reactions between Li metal and electrolyte were decreased because of the larger particle size, which increased Coulombic efficiency to 99% and the inhibition of dendrite formation in propylene carbonate electrolyte using 4.9 mol/kg of LiFSI ionic liquids [174]. Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide has also been used with a variety of solvents such as acetonitrile [175], 1,2-dimethoxyethane [173], dimethyl sulfoxide, and lithium nitrate (LiNO3) instead of LiFSI [176]. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (7 M, LiTFSI) in 1,3-dioxolane and 1,2-dimethoxyethane [178] and LiTFSI in 1,2-dimethoxyethane [177] have all been used to suppress Li dendrite formation in Li-ion and Li-air batteries [174]. In all the above studies, highly concentrated electrolytes were used that promoted saltsolvent coordination, with fewer solvents available for Li metal to react with and the formation of an ionic-liquid interface [179], causing further degradation of the dendritic formation. The lower conductivities of these ionic liquids are offset by their high thermal stability, low volatility, high carrier density, and high reduction/ oxidation efficiency [180].\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 31\nLi deposition in the form of nanowires can also promote cycling and retard dendritic formation and stability at the anode. The use of dual-salt electrolytes of LiTFSI and lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB)in ethylene carbonate and ethyl methyl carbonate (E/MC) generates uniform fibrous growth, which protects the metal Li anode. This arrangement leads to long cycling stability and fast charging with high-energy cathode materials (LiNi0.4Mn0.4Co0.2O2/ethyl carbonate, NMC-type battery [181]. The addition of 0.05MLiPF6 to the LiTFSI-LiBOB/E/MC generates compacted wire-like Li deposits with conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) films on the Li metal surface. In addition, the remaining LiPF6 initiated polymerization of the EC molecules to form polycarbonates on the Li metal surface and also to protect the cathode substrate aluminum from corrosion by TFSI anions. Likewise, the Li metal anode is similarly protected by the inorganic/polymeric nanocomposite SEI layers during periodic Li deposition/stripping cycles, and the uniform Li wires promote high charging capability because of the lower charge-transfer resistance of the SEI films, lowering their chargetransfer resistance [182]. If the polymeric/electrolyte at the SEI layer is conductive, flexible, and compact, protection against dendrite formation and enhanced Coulombic efficiency can occur; however, if the morphology of the wire/fiber/polymeric nanocomposite is highly porous, insulating, or rigid, then protection does not occur, resulting in lower Coulombic efficiency and shorter cycle lifetimes (cf. Figs. 1.16 and 1.17)."

      "text" : "Liquid electrolytes flow and interact with the porous electrolyte resulting in side reactions that degrade Coulombic efficiency [183]. Solid-state electrolytes do not have this limitation; however, their low conductivities at room temperatures (< 10 4 Scm 1) require high temperatures (80 C) as stated earlier in the chapter\n[184]. The self-assembled polyanionic BAB triblock copolymers (see Fig. 1.16) finely tune mechanical properties, ionic conductivity, and lithium transport number at the same time. A triblock (ABA)-type polyelectrolyte based on poly(styrene trifluoromethanesulphonylimide of lithium) P(STFSILi) associated with a central A block based on a linear poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and terminating with the B-block was evaluated and demonstrated high ionic conductivity (1.3 10 5 S cm 1 at 60 C), carrier transport number (> 0.85), and electrochemical stability u to 5 V (relative to Li/Li) [185]. The mechanical strength at these temperatures was reduced, slowing but not eliminating dendrite formation.\nInorganic solid-state electrolytes contain a heteroatom such as sulfur and have been shown to be conducted at room temperature. Other electrolytes based on oxygen, SiO4, have slightly lower conductivities (10\n3 Scm 1 for LiSICON and 10 4 Scm 1 for garnet solid-state electrolytes, respectively) [186]. All of these electrolytes are sensitive to moisture or air (sulfur) or are not stable against Li metal (oxygen) and require special insert fabrication environments [187]. While garnet-type solid-state electrolytes are stable with Li metal, the grain boundaries of the garnet promote Li dendrite formation, lowering the cycle life of the cell [188], in addition to the general higher interfacial resistance of solid-state electrolytes relative to the liquid carbonate-based electrolytes [189].\nThe interfacial resistance between the solid-state electrolyte based on garnet and Li metal anode can be reduced by fabrication of three-dimensional ion-conductive networks deposited by atomic layer deposits. Examples of such as an approach include deposition of Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 (LLCZNO) electrolyte on Al2O3 [190] or Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) on Ge [191] or Li6.4La3Zr2Al0.2O12 (LLZAO, [192] ). These composites increase the Li conductivity of the solid-state electrolyte and decrease interfacial resistance. The sandwich of LLCNO-Al2O3 has no void space and excellent contact with Li, whereas LLCNO alone has pores and voids with poor interfacial interaction. Thin layers of LLCNO-Al2O3 improve the wettability of the garnet surface, similar to LiZr5(PO4)3 that was electrochemically stable to 5.5 V with low interfacial resistance to Li-ion transfer [193]. Even after 100 h testing, the electrolyte retained its solid dense morphology without any dendrite formation, suggesting that co-addition of LiZr2(PO4)3 solid electrolyte can inhibit Li dendrite formation. Thus, unlike a liquid electrolyte, the solid type can act as a membrane to block dendrite formation and to stabilize the anode (Fig. 1.17).\nThe Li metal anode can also be stabilized using SEI membranes; examples include use of an elastomer/lithium phosphorous oxynitride (LiPON) SEI membrane by using the mechanical protective properties of the elastomer layer and the chemical protective of the LiPON layer, allowing the anode to be stable up to 100 plating/ stripping cycles at 2 mAcm 2 [195].\nAtomic layered deposition, used to coat Al2O3 at the anode, was able to protect the Li surface from corrosion from electrolytes, sulfides, and air, improving cycling stability of lithium-sulfur cells. Through surface structural engineering, a functional space was provided for Li to grow in the forms of columns rather than dendrites on the Cu foil. The arrangement of interconnected hollow carbon\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 33\nshells was able to provide an avenue for the growth of Li-ion flux instead of deposition of Li in the form of treelike dendrites [196]. This two-dimensional arrangement was extended in three dimensions with the fabrication of carbon granules and enable over 95% of Li utilization (as Li-ion instead of Li metal dendrites) [197]. Other approaches include mechanical and chemical treatment of separators, where one face is coated with a conductive material facing the anode. The Li-ion flux toward the conductive face forms a dense dendrite layer without extending toward the cathode. A non-conductive 3D member was recently reported, where Al2O3 membranes infused with liquid electrolytes of LiTFSI/1,3-dioxolane/1,2dimethoxyethane [198] or LiTFSI/1-methyl-3-propylpiperidinium/SiO2/propylene carbonate. The propensity of dendrite formation was inhibited by using pore size in size-exclusion modality, limiting the size of potential dendrites which could be formed. Other strategies using the conceptualized approach described use porous polyimide 3D separator [199] or polymer nanofiber separators [200]."

      "text" : "Most anodes have a tubular or flat 2D morphology which during cell cycling (charging/discharging) undergoes physical change because of Li stripping or deposition and often results in dendrite formation because of uneven Li-ion distribution on the electrode. To alleviate low Coulombic efficiency, the current collectors have been constructed from copper [201], nickel [202], graphene [203], or carbon fibers [204] to minimize morphological changes in the anode structure over prolonged use of the cell. One approach relied on the use of skeletal templating where the current collector was made from a reduction of CuOH2 fiber arrays [205]. The dendrite tips have a large charge density and act as the focus of Li deposition within the electric field. By creating an overlaid Skelton, the ends of the fibers act as nucleation sites for growth because of lower and uniform charge, leading to less sharp contours of deposited Li and higher Li cycling stability. Other potential designs are a fabrication of vertical column geometry, such as nanowires, to decrease Li-ion “hot spots” and to generate a more uniform ion distribution throughout the structure. Since there are fewer charge centers, there are fewer dendrites, relative to a 2D planar electrode as a current collector [206]. Graphene and graphene oxide (GO) have also been evaluated because of their intrinsic properties [207–209], where, often, Li metal is layered between the reduced GOs, generating a Li-rGO-Li-rGO multilayer composite. This arrangement lowers potential volume change at the anode [210]. Alternatively, modified Li anode on stainless steel and titanium formed a “sawtooth”-type arrangement, with Li nucleation being directed by the nano-notches at the expense of dendritic growth [211].

Since batteries are electrochemical cells, they discharge and charge in cycles, and the depth of discharge is 85%, with a battery life of 1500 cycles; the approximate travel of an electric vehicle would be 6 km/kWh which is equivalent to 2.2 kg CO2-eq per 100 km traveled. By increasing the Coulombic efficiency through better anode design, the increase in battery life to 2000 cycles and reduction of CO2-eq from 2.2 kg to 1 kg CO2-eq per 100 km traveled, the total carbon emissions can be reduced to 100 kg CO2-eq per kWh of battery capacity. This corresponds to approximately burning 11.24 gallons of ethanol-free gasoline or 9.8 gallons of diesel [219] or 2.38 kg of CO2 from burning 1 kg of coal (assuming that 65% by mass is carbon). Other important factors that impact the environment are the use of copper, lithium, and aluminum. While lithium is not toxic, the extraction from seawater by evaporation, ion-exchange cleanup, purification, and carbonation is a high-energy process and will generate more carbon dioxide than is eliminated by savings in gasoline consumption/combustion [220].\nA study compared two equivalent auto models (VW Gold and eGolf) and determined the former would utilize 8 l of gasoline to travel 100 km, generating approximately 9 kg of CO2 through direct combustion, while the latter would utilize 16 kWh of energy, and CO2-eq was 9 kg CO2-eq, while in less industrial advanced countries, the output was between 0.9 kfCO2/kWh (India) and 0.05 kgCO2/kWh (Paraguay) [221]. To reduce global warming potential, replacement of ICEVs by EVs alone is not sufficient. An integrated approach is required by moving toward sustainable energy sources including nuclear power and carbon capture technologies or decarbonization of generation of power. Over the last 5 years, the fastest-growing sector in energy has been sustainable energies related to wind and solar. There has been a decline in coal and a slight increase in the use of natural gas for the generation of electricity.

      "text" : "Intermittency of wind and solar is addressed through energy storage with a variety of battery platforms including Li batteries to provide a localized off-grid energy solution [223]. In addition, some communities have adopted a distributed grid system with local wind or solar power within the homes or nearby, depending on generating capacity [224]. The locally generated power is stored and consumed without using the general or national grid. An expansion of this concept would require secondary storage including the use of existing capacity in the form of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) to facilitate the electrification of the road and home (e.g., solar home systems) network [225]. The role of recycling is often overlooked but is critical in reclaiming the Li, Al, Cu, Ni, and Co and reducing the carbon dioxide emitted during the manufacturing processes [226].\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 37\nThe role of energy in the United States was governed by the SecondWorldWar [227] followed by the “Space Age” using a mix of regulatory incentives, tax credits, quotas, and caps from foreign competition and privatization of some federal agencies to facilitate innovation [228]. While the utility operators were few, the market price was relatively constant and encouraged private capital investment, overcapacity, and spikes in pricing. The “oil crisis” refocused federal policy on nonpetroleum energy sources such as hydro, nuclear, wind, and battery [229]; however concerns about nuclear plant safety and escalating costs led to less investment and less expansion of nuclear as an energy mix, because of limit profits from such enterprises [230]. During the Reagan Administration, the policy favored privatization and deregulation and restructuring of the electricity marketplace to increase competition and lower consumer pricing. During the last two decades, the utility operators have focused on transmission, rather than a generation to control market prices. This is reflected in the corporate structure of the various utilities with the bulk (prior to the Reagan) administration being private investorowned utilities which supplied over 80% of the electricity. This decreased to 40% after restructuring, which split energy into generation and transmission [231]. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates interstate natural gas pipelines, wholesale electricity markets, regional transmission authorities, and independent systems operators (ISOs). These changes have a defocused investment on energy generation, adding resilience to the transmission grid and updating aging equipment, in addition to regulating emissions of greenhouses gases, which are regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [232]. The regulatory framework historically (except for nuclear and biofuels) has been state-level mandates for renewables such as state renewable portfolio standards (RPS), state net energy metering (NEM), and California’s Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV). The Federal level has focused on rebates and tax concessions such as the Federal Production Tax Credit (PTC), investment tax credit (ITC), and federal tax incentives (FTIs) [233]. The expiration of the business energy tax credits and implementation of the 1992 Energy Policy Act attempted to stabilize the cost of electricity by renewables through a tax credit of 1.5 ¢/kWh for the first 10 years of production fromwind [234]; until the Energy Policy Act of 2005 phased out tax credits, the policy was successful in promoting the development of wind power while also meeting state-mandated RPS requirements [235]. The RPS mandates require a fixed percentage of the state ’s energy mix be derived from sustainable energy resources, not prescriptive in nature of which technology, and have allowed 37 states [236] to meet the requirement from wind power (68%)."

      "text" : "Photovoltaics-based net metering policies have been adopted in 43 states, which guide the level of compensation of distributed power supplied to the grid, first deployed in California [237]. The 2005 Energy Policy Act introduced a 30% ITC for commercial and residential (ceiling of $2000) systems, with residential credits capped at $2000, [238] and are expected to expire in 2021, unless renewed.\n38 S. Bashir et al.\nBiofuels have had two periods of support, excise tax incentives from the late 1970s to the mid-2000s (1978–2011) and as blending mandates (2005–today), to counter high oil prices and assist the rural farming communities from transition from feed crops to energy crops, as well as address environmental concerns [239]. The 1978 National Energy Act promulgated a 4 ¢/gallon excise tax exemption for “gasohol” (i.e., gasoline with 10% alcohol/v.) which was extended to 1992 by the 1980 Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act, and the 1980 Gasohol Competition Act place a 54 ¢/gallon ethanol import tariff to dissuade foreign imports. The 1992 and 1998 Energy Policy Acts extended the tax credits to other blends up through 2007. The increased use of ethanol fuels after 1998, when methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a fuel which oxygenates gasoline, was found leaking into groundwater and was a potential source of cancer [240] led to protests. In response, many states banned the use of MTBE as a fuel additive, leading refineries to use blended ethanol as a substitute [241]. The increase in ethanol usage and associated tax exemption leads to the 2004 Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) which replace a tax exemption with a tax credit to fuel blenders of 51 ¢/gallon of ethanol, which was reduced to 45 ¢/gallon in 2008 and allowed to expire by 2012. This increase in part was fostered by the RFS mandate which required fuel providers to blend a minimum quantity of biofuels into the US petroleum supply each year [242]. The mandate required 2% fuel oxygen content, primarily as a means to lower ozone and smog production because of incomplete fuel combustion. In addition, it promoted US fuel security and rural agro-farming jobs [243]. The oxygenates were utilized to stabilize fuels after lead [244] was phased out during the 1970s [245] because of the toxicity of lead in children and adults [246].\nThe impact of the initial renewable fuel standard (RFS) mandate was to add four billion gallons of biofuels to the petroleum grid by 2006, raising it by 7.5 million by 2012. The Gulf War during the Bush (W.) Administration led to higher gasoline prices, which in turn fostered a more ambitious expansion of the RFS standard. The revision mandate increased the blending targets to 36 billion gallons by 2022, nearly 1/5 of anticipated motor fuel consumption [247]. The bill conflagrated two distinct policies, the first to increase market uptake and stabilize the marketplace and fuel prices favored by the Republican Party, in addition to promoting energy independence, another Republican Party-favored policy. The House and Senate members of the Democratic Party favored expansion of ethanol biofuels to cellulosic biofuels and submandates for life cycle greenhouse gas reductions. The democratic favored policy toward greener energy and jobs within the framework of the pro-ethanol alliance [248]. Higher startup costs associated with cellulose have slowed cellulosic ethanol, and these submandates have been revised downward. In the current iteration of the RFS mandate, the fuel blend of 10% ethanol (E10) has already been met and poses no technical issues to automobiles or trucks; however additional blends of 1% (E15) and 85% (E85) require hardware changes to automobiles and trucks. While new models (2013 and beyond) can tolerate E15, older models cannot since ethanol at the higher blends is corrosive to rubber gaskets, absorbs more\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 39\nwater that dissociates into two layers in the gas tank, and clogs up fuel lines. Only flex-fuel vehicles can tolerate E85 blends; therefore further blending would require additional changes to the ICEs."

      "text" : "The push for cleaner air centered on a number of initiatives at the state level, principally in California, because of the propensity of smog in the major metropolitan cities. The Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate was designed to meet the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) ozone standards, a component of smog [249]. The potential to lose Federal funding because of non-compliance with CAA regulations focused on policy in California to examine the role of car emissions. The state legislature set up the California Air Resources Board and tasked it to assess air quality and regulations to reduce vehicle emissions [250]. The board developed a Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and Clean Fuels Program which included near-zero and Zero-Emission Vehicle standards and mandate [251]. The LEV standard has been periodically revised and currently requires 15% of vehicles sold in California to meet the ZEV standard by 2025, which includes flex fuels and hybrid vehicles. Because of the associated high startup costs, the lawmakers were also able to push for federal tax incentives [252].\nThe tax policy also coincided with the Bush (W.) Administration goal of reducing oil imports and the 1992 Energy Policy Act of opening up federal lands for oil exploration and the introduction of regulations to make automakers design and build more fuelefficient automobiles. The bill introduced Production Tax Credit (PTC), extended previous biofuel tax credits including income tax credit for purchasing new EVand an additional income tax deduction for purchasing a clean-fuel vehicle (Clean-Fuel Vehicle Tax Dedication (CFVTD), flex fuel liquid natural gas, E85, EV, Fuel cell) that tapered down from 2002 to 2004 after which the rebates/incentives would expire [253]. The rebate drawdown was revised in further legislation, and in the 2005 Energy Policy Acts, the CFVTD was replaced by the Alternative Motor Vehicle Tax Credit (AMVTC) to promote hybrid vehicle uptake, which gave US automakers tax credits for the first 60,000 hybrids sold. This benefited US makers because of their introduction of hybrids later in the market. By this time, most of the Japanese car makers had sold more than 60,000 models (during the time period when the AMVTC did not exist [254] while allowing the EV tax incentives to expire. The 2005 Energy Policy Act allowed the EV tax credits to expire but was revived via the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act capped at 250,000 vehicles nationwide. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“stimulus package”) expanded this to 200,000 vehicles per automaker through 2014, which was extended by the 2014 American Taxpayer Relief Act [255] and subsequently rolled back as EV sales rose and the cost of the tax incentive increased.\n40 S.

      "heading" : "1.22 Perspectives, Conclusion, and Policy Implications: Li-Ion Battery Pitfalls, Challenges, and Development Road Map",
      "text" : "The rollout of Li-ion batteries as the primary platform for high-end electronics, cell phones, and most electric vehicles has indirectly displaced coal as the primary resource for the generation of electricity in the United States. However, Li-ion batteries are not carbon neutral, as the extraction of the metal and metal oxides requires energy that is not offset by usage in electric vehicles, although the emissions are lower than corresponding gasoline internal combustion engine-based vehicles. Li-ion batteries have the potential to become an energy sustainable resource but would need to increase change density through redesign of the anode/current collector, electrolyte, and membrane. The dependence on cobalt will need to be reduced to meet future global demand, and this effort should be integrated with integrated recycling, and more importantly, the carbon footprint should be decreased.\nThe electrification of the home and road transport has to be integrated with demands for power generation, and transmittance from sustainable resources instead of fossil fuels, because the lower electric vehicle (EV) emissions from vehicles are not sufficient to reduce the global warming potential below 2 C. This requires a switch to nuclear, hydro, thermal, and sustainable resources with secondary battery storage to offset intermittency issues and load leveling. The fabrication of Li-ion batteries is an energy-intensive process, and this contributes toward greenhouse emissions. Recycling the components would promote more efficient usage and lessen the burden on mining or extraction of Li from seawater, which appear to be the driving force in current pricing and availability. A longer-term potential bottleneck is the availability and price of cobalt, a key component in cathode fabrication, and use of lithium cobalt oxide (LCO)-based cells in portable electronics. Research in cobalt-free electrodes, with high-energy densities, is required, particularly in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and lithium manganese oxide (LMO) cells. As EVs past one million units sold worldwide (projected 1.9 million by 2018 contrasted with 81 million internal combustion engines (ICEs) globally) newer global standards are required to minimize, waste, greenhouses gases (GHGs,) recycling and battery lifecycle and cost reductions.\nWith two million units to be sold by 2019, the vehicle-to-grid, secondary life battery storage to extend their utility will become significant because of market penetration and wider availability. These capabilities will ensure that batteries are used to their maximum usage before battery depth of discharge (DoD) (defined as the percentage of the battery that has been discharged relative to the overall capacity of the battery) has been reached before recycling or disposal. Off-grid storage such as that used in solar home systems can provide local infrastructure, a road map for electrification of communities in rural and underdeveloped regions of the world.\nThe energy density of Li-ion batteries could be accomplished through Li anode redesign, where low Coulombic efficiency (CE) is attributed to the formation of dendrites, as well as overheating and potential chemical fire generation. Some of these\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 41\ndisadvantages may be eliminated or reduced through the incorporation of solid-state electrolytes, although the Li metal at anode and anode interface optimization has not been solved. The redox flow battery platform offers potential benefits in high-energy secondary storage scenarios; however, there remain series of technical hurdles before flow batteries become mainstream. This is because of the limited redox potential of species in non-aqueous electrolytes of materials for cathodes and anodes that can generate a stable couple. Newer materials that can push the redox potential of the anode to lower values to maximize the cell voltage are required. Hybrid flow batteries with lithium metal anodes suffer from cycling instability where the lithium metal deteriorates by dendritic formation during the deposition phase, in addition to secondary reactions with the electrolyte leading to low Coulombic efficiency during repeated charging and discharging. If the short-term liquid electrolyte will continue to be used, strategies will need to be employed to reduce Li dendrite growth through restriction of changes to the volume. Current approaches focus on the metal host to limit Li volume changes during deposition. These hosts as 2D or 3D matrices limit dendrite growth resulting in CE degradation and promote nucleation of the Li thorough the matrix because of the porous nature of the template. The anode/electrolyte also needs to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film or a passivated protected layer to promote high CE of the Li metal anode. Generally, this is accomplished through the incorporation of high conductivity oxides or nitrides such as LiF, Li3N, and Li3PO3 compounds.\nThe cell performance is also related to the uniformity of the electric field on the electrode surface, which in turn is related to morphology changes during deposition/ stripping. Incorporation of a porous buffer layer-based transmission channel can promote uniform stripping and plating, where electrostatic shielding because of the presence of cations can facilitate homogeneous Li deposition. Anode metals with lower potential and high-energy capacity are required to replace Li metal. Newer designs focus on electron transfer between active metals at the electrode and current collectors, via a redox shuttle. The shuttle, in turn, is charged/discharged in a secondary storage tank that is filled with the active material, using LiCoO2 and LiVPO4F as cathode, and lower potential materials, like Li4Ti5O12 as the anode. To lower the overpotential loss, the potentials of the redox molecules need to be better matched.\nThe key challenges for efficient and long-term Li battery design should focus on better characterization of the nanomaterials used in the fabrications of the electrodes, using electron microscopy, templating the reaction between anode and electrolyte such that contact is minimized and CE is set at 99% or greater; electrodes should be designed to yield high charge current densities (>1 mA cm 2) and area utilization (4 mAh cm 2), with thermodynamic modeling of lithium intercalation with (N/S/O) heteroatoms than Li||Al or Li||Cu cells. Another redesign should factor in use of non-Li anodes to limit dendrite formation; limit Li metal volume change upon cycling (<10% volume change) particularly at the Li/Separator face and by using low electrical conductivity 2D/3D structured templates to direct Li deposition on the scaffold. In addition, Li deposition on anode current collector should be better controlled using 1/2/3 D optimized geometry current collectors. Simplifying Li metal stabilization process and overall battery box design for more efficient recycling and second life usage, as well as leach-free disposal, would lower costs and reduce the carbon and environmental burden.\n42 S. Bashir et al.\nMany of these design limitations require fabrication of specific topologies that rely on the application of nanomaterials to limit dendrite growth but promote Li nucleation and limit gross morphological changes during charging/discharging cycle which will be extended to newer platforms such as Li-sulfur and Li-air technologies. While the focus of the current book chapter is on Li-ion batteries, storage technologies also include lead-acid, zinc bromide, sodium sulfur, sodium-nickel chloride, polysulfide bromine, vanadium redox, and nickel cadmium which offer solid cycling capacity and intermediate power densities and high round-trip efficiencies."

      "text" : "A storage policy should include a mix of battery technologies and wind or photovoltaics (PV) for energy generation. The cost of energy generation using life cycle assessment (LCA) should also include the loss of power probability, intermittency, and environmental impact. As the loss of power probability decreases, the cost of energy and cells in the storage stack increases, requiring some optimization between cost and reliability. As the population of EVs localized sustained energy in the form of wind and solar increases, the environmental impact of lead, cadmium, cobalt, and aluminum should be considered as part of an LCA. Wind/PV systems for battery DoD values ranging from 50% to 80% (stationary power) and 80% to 100% (EVs) would require battery cell replacement at more frequent intervals than the project life replacement of 25 years; therefore increasing battery energy density and lifetime is critical to lower carbon emission and potential toxicity because of end of life. Some of the newer battery technologies address these pitfalls, but currently, no battery platform has the desired lifetime, energy, and cost matrix."

      "text" : "Framework (1970–2006)\nThe absence of an effective policy regarding battery deployment and recycling is disappointing but not unexpected as these technologies have not reached critical mass but are anticipated before 2025, which would necessitate lawmakers to implement policies similar to the ZEV policy from the State of California in the mid-1990s. The federal government across numerous several administrations (Carter to Bush (W.)) has not adopted a policy that has an integrated environment and energy. In many instances, federal policies have been formulated because of external stress (oil embargo, Gulf War, recession), to decrease dependence on oil import, and protect American jobs in key sectors through tax cuts, rebates, and incentives. The Obama Administration for the first time attempted to align energy and environmental policy through the Clean Coal Act, which limited electricity generation from coal, and promoted natural gas and sustainable resources through a combination of\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 43\nregulative fixes and monetary concessions to end-users, as well as utility operators. Many energy policies were renewed, such as Energy Policy Acts or, extended beyond the initial mandate (e.g., biofuels), or passed as part of large omnibus energy bills. Many policies were incrementally revised upwards or downwards with cost estimates being short of actual targets. Some energy policy was highly partisan and polarizing on renewable energy [256]. US policymaking has not adopted a planned long-term policy but rather a series of policies that have been revised depending on the current stress and political considerations. Sustained advocacy coalitions in many instances had led the states to enact specific mandates related to sustainable energy transitions to avoid policy retrenchment particularly to tax incentives to Li-ion batteries in the EV sector."

      "text" : "Under the Obama Administration to highlight how policies can change during the lifetime of an administration (first term, 2009–2013, House/Senate majorities D + 79/D + 14), the Democratic Party had a supermajority in the Senate for approximately 7 months. From 2009 to 2011, over 50 energy-related policies to clean coal and renewables were started. The general framework of these policies overall was related to clean coal, bioenergy, energy storage, geothermal energy, offshore wind energy, and smart grid:\nFederal cost-sharing for projects at the demonstration stage was rigorously maintained, without consideration of risks for specific projects.\nThe federally funded clean energy project was highly partisan or gained polarized opinion across the political spectrum, partly fueled by limited data sharing from the project to potential end-users and stakeholders.\nIn some cases, industrial or public pressure accelerated scale-up of demonstration projects before they were mature and ready for deployment, such as carbon capture, utilization, and storage for power generation and lastly risk aversion.\nPolicymakers wanted experimental technology to behave akin to mature technologies with zero risks. Under the Obama Administration’s first term, projects managed by the Department of Energy that did not meet the benchmarks were canceled. This may be because of the passing of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) component within the Stimulus Bill [257] or congressional imposed fiscal austerity by the Congress who controlled both Houses of the Congress (Republican Majority, House/Senate R + 49/D + 4) and potential hostility to a president from the Democratic Party. The lessons from the Obama Administration’s first term, which from the first midterms until the end of his presidency was controlled by members of the Republican Party, had been that the federal government can effectively shepherd newer technologies past the innovation and testing phase.\n44 S. Bashir et al.\n1.26 Perspectives, Conclusion, and Policy Implications: Trump Administration (2016–2018) and the Plausible Future (2019–2021)\nBefore an analysis of the Trump Administration is given, it should be noted that the present administration is only 1.5 years old and the 2018 midterms are still 6 months [258]:\nPrioritized economic growth is stimulated through tax cuts and deregulation. It appears that many of the strategies favored under the Obama Administration related to Clean Power Plan (CPP) and its Clean Energy Incentive Program including carbon capture and storage (CCS) are abandoned [259].\nNatural gas will continue to be a significant component of US energy portfolio given the magnitudes of natural gas reserves, low natural gas prices, and cleaner combustion relative to coal [16]. It appears that fracking for natural gas, directives to utilize more coal for electricity, and further deregulation [260] of environmental regulations specifically arising from CPP/CCS [261] will continue [262]. Policies towards oil independence will continue through the implementation of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines, enabling greater access to and streamlined exploration permits to be issued for federal lands [263]. In addition the markets are being regulated through incentives and tariffs, specifically promoting US steel for pipeline construction tapered with 10–25% tariffs on aluminum and steel [264] for foreign imports which may retard growth and stagnate domestic demand for transportation fuels from US oil refiners, although this may also increase export opportunities to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to India, China, South America, and Asia [265]. The trade imbalance and potential lifting of international tariffs on US goods may free access to export light crude, LNG, and import inexpensive feedstocks benefiting refiners and petrochemical companies and potentially utility operators that can sell electricity to Canada and Mexico and import fuel supplies using current and proposed pipelines. If US partners (North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA consisting of the United States, Mexico, and Canada), European Union (EU)) do not enact trade-free legislation and trade disputes escalate over NAFTA/ EU/China, this may negatively impact import of raw materials and export of refined oils and selectivity and is an uncertainty for the energy sectors [266]. If no agreement can be sought and trade tariffs as proposed are implemented, then import and export costs would increase and are not offset by the recent tax bills for US oil, steel, coal, and utility companies [267].\nThe other environmental and energy policies from the Obama Administration that are likely to be rolled back are exceptions for inadvertently killing birds (operators can inadvertently kill 4200 bald eagles a year without penalty), wind and solar power subsidies, and potential rolling back federal ethanol mandates passed under the Bush (W.) Administration. It is also likely that the Trump Administration will facilitate Yucca Mountain storage facility for spent nuclear fuel to begin operations and potential deregulation and tax concessions for operators to design and build small molten salt reactors powered by thorium. An increase in a hydropower-based generation (reversing policy from the Obama\n1 Technology Policy and Road Map of Battery 45\nAdministration) and the construction of natural gas export terminals allow American energy companies to export natural gas (a policy that was also blocked under the Obama Administration). It is uncertain how effective this policy will be if countries in the EU/China and NAFTA impose an “energy tax” in response to the current and future tariffs proposed by the Trump Administration [268].\nWhile the present administration is less than 2 years old, a number of general policy frameworks can be discerned. These are:\nFocus on policy reversal instead of correction, conservative coalition using fossil fuel industry executives to align environmental policy within the context of energy, and independence of energy policy Comprehensive reform and expansion of coal and natural gas development, including upstream expansion and downshift deregulation to promote American jobs coupled with import (caps?) and tariffs on select industries Potential promotion of nuclear power to expand civilian sector nuclear capacity and capability in line with increasing American jobs and a general withdrawal or rollback from multilateral agreements which affect jobs, particularly in the fossil fuel, manufacturing, and infrastructure arena [269]\nThe post-2018 domestic energy policy is unclear because of the approaching midterm elections. In the case of the Obama Administration, after the Democratic Party lost control of the House in 2011 and Senate (2015), the energy policy was altered from 2011 onwards to take account of the bifurcated nature of governance. Policies that were perceived as partisan or polarizing could not pass both houses (under Republican majority) to be signed by law by the President (from the Democratic Party). The Trump Administration spanned the 114th (House/ 1320 Senate) R + 57/R + 9 and session of the 115th Congress (R + 42/R + 2), and although currently enjoys a Grand Old Party (GOP) majority in both houses as well as the presidency, the majority in the 116th Congress may not materialize. Like the Obama Administration, a recalibration between energy independence and policies that promote the environment including tax incentives for sustainable energy platforms may be reintroduced including a rollback of favorable coal legislation to reflect the political realities on the ground for the new Congress. Assuming there are no new political realities and the GOP retain small majorities the policies that are likely to be enacted based on current presidential executive orders or memorandum or selection of cabinet secretaries from (conservative states with pro-fossil fuel credentials) are likely to continue.\nAcknowledgments The authors wish to thank the College of Arts and Sciences (CoA&S, Dr. Bashir, 160336-00002), ACS-PRF (Liu), SFFP (Bashir) and Welch Departmental Grant (AC-0006, Dr. Hahn), NSF-MRI acquisition (Liu), URA (160315-00015, Liu), and RDF grants (160345-00005, Liu), at Texas A&M University-Kingsville (TAMUK), for funding.\n46 S.

      "text" : "Electrochemical energy storage and conversion have become the unquestionable challenges and critical technologies in the world, in response to the decreasing availability of fossil fuels and environmental pollution. The energy storage and conversion systems that can electrochemically produce energy have been seriously considered as the alternative power sources, as long as these systems are designed economically and environmentally friendly [1]. These systems include batteries, electrochemical capacitors (supercapacitors), and fuel cells, some of which have been widely used in electronic products, electric vehicles, and the smart grid. Although the mechanisms of these three kinds of devices for energy storage and conversion are different, they still share some common features in electrochemistry. Their electrochemical reactions take place at the interface between the electrolyte and electrode where electron and ion transport are separated to storage/release the energy through the charge/discharge process. There are many different kinds of battery technologies on the market or under development, ranging from primary batteries to rechargeable batteries and solar cells. Supercapacitors include electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors, distinguished by the processing mechanism whether non-Faradaic or Faradaic. Fuel cells have many categories in terms of the properties of electrolytes. Figure 2.1 displays the operation mechanism of three selected kinds of devices, namely rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, pseudocapacitors, and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), and all of them consist of some basic components: cathode, anode, and electrolyte with two electrodes contacting with the electrolyte solution.\nBoth batteries and fuel cells store and release charges through the redox reaction of the electrode materials and stored fuels, respectively that own chemical energy. These chemical reactions are associated with Faradaic charge transfer between an electrolyte and electrode surface, and attendant phase changes. The discharge process is usually taken as the nominal defining process for an energy storage and conversion device, so the term, negative electrode is anode where the oxidation reaction at this side usually take place at lower electrode potentials than the cathode side (positive electrode). This definition of electrode directions is only suitable for the pseudocapacitors which process the energy via Faradaic reaction but meaningless for the EDLC systems which use physical adsorption/desorption of the ions at the electrolyte/electrode interface, termed as electrical double layer.\n62 W. Song and J. Chen\nIn lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the redox reactions of electrodes are accompanied by the Faradaic charge-transfer between the electrolyte and electrode surface, moving lithium ions in a rocking-chair way to realize the discharge/charge process. The electrode reactions of LIBs are highly dependent on the electrode potentials; thus, the cyclic voltammograms usually display typical oxidation and reduction current peaks, and the galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles show voltage plateaus. As a result of the kinetic barriers for electron transfer such as Ohmic resistance, and ionic transport difficulty, the redox reactions of electrodes take place at potentials substantially different in discharge and charge process, with anodic peak more positive than cathodic peak. The electrode reactions are irreversible around the thermodynamic reversible potential; thus, the anodic and cathodic overpotential is required to drive the respective reactions at specific net rates. Accordingly, the cycle life of rechargeable batteries is usually limited and the relatively slow chemical reactions require a long time for charge/discharge.\nIn EDLC, the electrostatic storage arises by separating charges in a Helmholtz double layer at the interface between the surface of a conductor electrode and an electrolyte solution. In the double layer structure, one electronic layer is located in the surface lattice of the electrode and the other layer, outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), is distributed in the electrolyte with opposite polarity from the dissolved and solvated ions. These two layers are separated by a thin layer of specifically adsorbed ions losing their solvent shell, termed as the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). The solvent molecules in IHP are physically adsorbed on the electrode surface and act as the molecular dielectric. The intrinsic process of a physical electrostatic adsorption/desorption enables EDLC to have ultrahigh power capability and fast charge/discharge rate.\nIn pseudocapacitors, the electrical energy is stored by Faradaic charge-transfer reaction of de-solvated and specifically adsorbed ions, achieved through the redox reactions, electrosorption, or intercalation on the electrode surface. This process is inevitably accompanied by a non-Faradaic contribution from static EDLC. In Faradaic reaction of a pseudocapacitive electrode, the electrons are transferred to or from the valence orbitals of the redox reagent clusters near the electrode surface at a distance, l (2Dt)½, where D is the diffusion coefficient (cm2 s 2) for chargecompensating ions and t is the time (s). The Faradaic reaction in pseudocapacitors is a fast reversible process and there is no formation or breaking of chemical bonds, and usually coupled with compensating reactions with protons, Li+ or Na+ ions [2].\nIn fuel cells, the chemical energy of a fuel is converted into electricity through an electrochemical reaction between hydrogen fuel and an oxidizing agent, oxygen, and the continuous supply of fuel and oxygen is required to sustain the chemical reaction. For fuel cells, the energy storage means the storage of fuels is in the tank while the energy conversion is in the cell; thus, the local separation in energy storage and conversion of fuel cells is distinguished with other electrochemical systems. The cathode and anode are just charge-transfer media in fuel cells usually assembled with a specific catalyst to promote hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions, respectively. Fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolytes, and SOFC, as schematically represented in the figure, uses solid oxide or ceramic electrolyte to allow oxygen ion transport.\n64 W. Song and J. Chen\nBatteries, especially the lithium-ion batteries, have been dominating the market of power sources in comparison with supercapacitors and fuel cells. However, the current performance of batteries is still insufficient to meet the increasing demand in many applications, such as the electric vehicles. In comparison with combustion engines and gas/steam turbines, the electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems still need unremitting development to improve the output capabilities in energy and power densities and lower the cost. To evaluate the energy contents of a system, the terms specific energy, which is expressed in watt-hours per kilogram (Wh kg 1), and energy density, which is expressed in watt-hours per liter (Wh L 1), are used. The rate capability is indicated by specific power in W kg 1 and power density in W L 1. In another style of expression, gravimetric and volumetric are used. The as-known Ragone plot which diagrams the energy and power capabilities of the specific energy system is developed in Fig. 2.2. Batteries owning intermediate energy and power characteristics are located in the gap between high-energy fuel cells and high-power supercapacitors. Some new-type electrochemical devices that combine electrodes of different reaction mechanisms and advantageous properties have been developed to improve the whole performance in both energy and power densities. These devices include asymmetric-electrode supercapacitors which consist of EDLC-type and pseudocapacitive materials as the actives of two electrodes and hybrid-electrode supercapacitors which have battery-type and capacitive electrodes. The combination of different types of electrodes in an electrochemical device aims to remarkably improve at least one of the energy or power capability without much sacrifice of another.\nThe properties of these electrochemical devices in energy storage and conversion are highly dependent on the electrode materials confined by both thermodynamics and kinetics. Nanostructured materials have attracted tremendous interest because of\n2 Understanding the Energy Storage Principles of Nanomaterials in Lithium. . . 65\ntheir unique mechanical, optical, and electrical properties and the benefits from the synergy of bulk and interfacial properties for efficient and effective energy conversion and storage [3]. Nanostructured materials are playing increasingly important roles in electrochemical energy storage, and especially the booming development of nanotechnologies have afforded emerging but effective tools in designing advanced energy materials [4]. It is a sizeable topic to understand the advantages and disadvantages of the nanomaterials used for energy storage and conversion, as well as the synthesis protocols and the control of the properties [3]. Although there are many novel concepts in fabricating devices and materials, it is beyond the scope of this chapter to present an exhaustive summary of different kinds of electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices and the assembled nanomaterials. Here, we focus on the typical materials and their synthesis strategies in the development of high-performance lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors. The basic electrochemistry fundamentals associated with the materials are also reviewed to understand the mechanism of electron and ion conduction in the materials."

      "text" : "The electrochemical reactions in electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices obey the thermodynamic and kinetic formulations. For chemical reactions in electrochemistry, thermodynamics suits the reversible electrochemical reactions and is capable of calculating theoretical cell potentials and electrolytic potentials. An equilibrium in the thermodynamics of an electrochemical cell means the reversibility in both chemical reaction and thermodynamic energy, leading to the reversible reaction in mass and energy. The reversibility in the chemical reaction of an electrochemical cell requires the electrode reaction in charging is the exact reverse reaction in discharging. The reversibility in thermodynamic energy implies that the energy in charging equals to the value in discharging, and both the systems and surroundings return to their original states when the cells work close to the equilibrium conditions where an infinitesimal current is applied. The basic thermodynamic equations for a reversible electrochemical reaction at constant temperature and pressure are given as:\nG ¼ H TS (2:1) where G is the Gibbs free energy (J), the useful energy for work from the electrochemical reaction. S is the entropy (J/K), T is the absolute temperature (K), and TS is the heat in an electrochemical reaction associated with the organization and disorganization of materials (J). H is enthalpy, the energy released by the reaction (J). The terms, G, H, and S are state functions that only depend on the properties of the materials and the states of the reactions initially and finally. ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS are the change in the parameters in the reaction. In the definition of H and S,\n66 W. Song and J. Chen\nH ¼ U þ pV (2:2) dQ ¼ TdS (2:3)\nwhere U is the internal energy (J) and pV is the volume work arising from volume change (L) V at the specific pressure (atm) P. Q is the heat transfer in a reversible process.\nIn an electrochemical reaction, the maximum amount of work that can be produced equals to ΔG, representing the net useful energy available from a given reaction. ΔG of an electrochemical cell is given by:\nΔG ¼ nEF (2:4)\nΔGΘ ¼ nEΘF (2:5) where n is the number of transferred electrons per mole of the reactant (mol), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol 1), and E is the electromotive force (EMF) of a cell in volt (V ). nF is the amount of electricity produced by a cell and dependent on the number of materials in the reaction, which is a capacity factor (C mol 1). The cell voltage is considered as an intensity factor. ΔGΘ and EΘ are the standard Gibbs free energy (J/mol) and EMF when all the reactants are of standard states (V). Spontaneous processes have a negative Gibbs free energy and a positive EMF with reactions going forward to a reversible manner. The van’t Hoff isotherm gives the relationship between the free energy and bulk chemical reactions:\nΔG ¼ ΔGΘ þ RT ln AP=ARð Þ (2:6)\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol 1 K 1), T is the absolute temperature in kelvins (K), and AP and AR are the activity of reactants and products, respectively (1 mol/L for solutes, 1 atm for gases). The replacement of free energy by nEF derives the Nernst equation, which signifies the relationship between the EMF and activity of the chemicals in the reaction.\nE ¼ EΘ þ RT nF ln AP=ARð Þ (2:7)\nAt the reaction extent of ξ = 1 mol, the change in Gibbs free energy is:\nΔG ¼ nEF ξ ¼ zEF (2:8)\nFor a general chemical reaction, the standard free-energy change and the equilibrium constant KΘa (dimensionless unit) are related by:\nΔGΘ ¼ nEΘF ¼ RTlnKΘa (2:9)\n2 Understanding the Energy Storage Principles of Nanomaterials in Lithium. . . 67\nFor T at room temperature, 298 K, the above equation can be transformed to be:\nEΘ ¼ RT nF lnKΘa ¼ 0:0591V n lgKΘa (2:10)\nThis equation denotes that the cell voltage E is directly proportional to the logarithm of the equilibrium constant (Ka). The parameters of cell voltage, freeenergy change, and equilibrium constant of a chemical reaction are able to calculate from Eqs. (2.9) and (2.10). An electrochemical cell consists of two electrodes and the cell potential is determined by the difference in electrode potentials ρ at two electrodes. Thus, the cell potential E(V ):\nE ¼ ρcathode ρanode (2:11) The experimental cell that has only one interesting electrode reaction of a specific material and metallic counter electrode is termed as a half cell. The electrode potentials arise from two electrode reactions, namely anodic and cathodic separately taking place at anode and cathode of a cell. The electrode potential can be obtained from the Nernst equation, pointing out the important relationship between ρ and the activity of the reference chemicals in the electrochemical reaction.\nρ ¼ ρΘ þ RT=nFð Þ ln Y aυoO = Y aυrR\n(2:12)\nwhere ρΘ is the standard electrode potential toward the reference reaction of hydrogen redox; [H2(P)|H +(a)], aυoO , and a υr R are the activity of the oxidant and reductant (units are 1 atm or 1 M); and υo and υr are the corresponding coefficient. Faraday’s laws give the quantification relationship between the amount of reaction and the current flowing in the system:\ng ¼ ItM=nF (2:13) where g is the grams of active material transformed in the reaction (g), I is the current flow in amps (A), t is the flowing time of the current in seconds (s), M is the molecular weight (g), and n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (dimensionless). This equation is used to evaluate the theoretical capacity of a material in the electrochemical reaction usually with a unit of mAh g 1.\nThe differential of H and G gives:\ndH ¼ dU þ pdV þ Vdp (2:14) dG ¼ dH TdS SdT (2:15)\nAccording to the firs law of thermodynamics, the reversible process without nonvolume work obeys:\ndU ¼ dQ pdV ¼ TdS pdV (2:16)\n68 W. Song and J. Chen\nThe combination of Eqs. (2.14), (2.15), and (2.16) derives,\ndG ¼ SdT þ Vdp (2:17) The differential by T in Eq. (2.17) gives temperature-dependent relation,\nS ¼ dG dT\np\n(2:18)\nand the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation is obtained in Eq. (2.19), which is a thermodynamic equation used for calculating changes in the Gibbs energy of a system as a function of temperature.\nG Hð Þ=T ¼ dG dT\np\n(2:19)\nThen, we can derive the transformation in Eq. (2.20).\nH ¼ zEF þ zFT dE dT\np\n(2:20)\nThe enthalpy of an electrochemical reaction can be calculated by measuring the cell potential and the cell voltage as a function of the temperature dE/dT, where z is the number of electrons transferred in the cell reaction or half-reaction (C). Reasonably the other thermodynamic parameters of the materials in the electrochemical reaction are clear. A positive dE/dT implies the cells heat on charge and cool on discharge, such as Ni-Cd batteries, while a negative dE/dT means the cells cool on charge and heat on discharge, such as the lead-acid batteries. Any change in the temperature signifies the heat exchange between the cells and the environment.\nIn the operation of electrochemical cells, the entropic heat is negligible in comparison with the irreversible heat. The heat given off by the system includes the reversible thermodynamic heat and the irreversible joule heat from the working of a cell in an irreversible way during charge and discharge process at finite current densities. As displayed in Eq. (2.21), the irreversible heat manifests as a departure from the equilibrium voltage Eocv which is the open-circuit voltage (ocv) of a cell (V), and the irreversible heat released is dependent on the practical cell terminal voltage ET(V) and the current (A).\nq ¼ TS þ It Eocv ETð Þ (2:21)\nHeat is released inside the battery at the reaction site, normally the interface between the electrode and electrolyte. The low rate operation may produce negligible heat, however, high-rate batteries must dissipate the released heat in time to ensure safety.\n2 Understanding the Energy Storage Principles of Nanomaterials in Lithium. . . 69"

      "text" : "Electrode kinetics mainly studies the net rate of electrochemical reaction and follows the same general considerations for chemical reactions. However, there is still some difference in the interface reactions. In electrochemical reactions, the potential drop in the double layer along the interface of electrode/electrolyte directly affects the activated species and the interface reaction is in a two-dimensional manner. The potential drop takes place when the current is drawn to the battery in comparison with the open-circuit voltage (Eocv), resulting from the electrode polarization (V). The difference between the irreversible electrode potential and equilibrium potential (Eocv) is termed as overpotential (η) and three types of kinetic limitations lead to the polarization (V).\nOhmic polarization is related to the resistance of the cell components and contact problems between these components (Ω).\nConcentration polarization, due to the mass transport limitation in the cell operation, causing the ionic concentration near the electrode is different from the bulk.\nActivation polarization, also termed as electrochemical polarization, is associated with the electrochemical redox or charge-transfer reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces where the kinetics affects the charge state of the electrode.\nThe overpotentials of the anode and cathode in a galvanic cell are expressed as:\nηanode ¼ Eanode,ir Eanode,r (2:22)\nηcathode ¼ Ecathode,r Ecathode,ir (2:23) where Eanode, ir and Ecathode, ir are the irreversible electrode potentials while Eanode, r and Ecathode, r are the reversible electrode potentials or equilibrium potentials. The practical cell terminal voltage ET should be smaller than the equilibrium potential resulting from the polarization and internal resistance of a cell.\nET ¼ Ecathode,r Eanode,r ηcathode þ ηanode þ IRð Þ (2:24)\nwhere IR is the potential drop arising from the internal resistance of a cell (Ω) which might be negligible at low current densities, and Eq.

However, the large current rates cause large overpotentials and thus small cell terminal potentials.\nET ¼ Ecathode,ir Eanode,ir (2:25)\nConcentration polarization arises from the emergence of the concentration gradient in the solution near the electrode surface in the passage of current through the electrode/solution interface. The concentration gradient is determined by the difference in the rate of electrochemical reaction at the electrode and the rate of ion migration in the solution from/to the electrode surface. When a chemical species participating in an electrochemical reaction is depleted and in short supply on the\n70 W. Song and J. Chen\nelectrode, transport of this matter takes place toward the electrode surface to balance the consumption of the species, termed as diffusion. Fick’s first law points out the relationship between the diffusion rate rdiffusion and concentration gradient:\nrdiffusion ¼ D Co Csð Þ=δ (2:26) whereD is the diffusion coefficient of the actives in electrode reaction (m2/s), δ is the thickness of the diffusion layer (m), Cs is the concentration of actives near the electrode surface (mol/L), and Co is the concentration of actives in bulk (mol/L). The parameter of Cs is the result from the competition between the rate of reaction and diffusion and affects the electrode current i, which is called diffusion current (A).\ni ¼ zFrelectrode ¼ zFrdiffusion ¼ zFD Co Csð Þ=δ (2:27) Here, the rate of the electrode reaction and the diffusion current are controlled by the ion diffusion process. The electrode reaction is driven by the electrode potentials and crucial for Cs.

At equilibrium potential, the rate of the oxidation reaction is equal to the reduction reaction; thus, the related oxidation current (8 ) equals the reduction current ( 8 !) and is termed exchange current 8O which is directly related to the reaction rate constant, the activities of reactants and products and the potential drop across the double layer. A large exchange current means a more reversible chemical reaction and low polarization at a given current. The electrode that has an exchange current in the range of 10 2 A cm 2 at room temperature is favored for use in batteries [1].\n8 ¼ 8 !¼ 8O (2:32)\n2 Understanding the Energy Storage Principles of Nanomaterials in Lithium. . . 71\nThe current density of the electrode reaction (A/m2) can be related with the rate of the chemical reaction.\n8 ¼ I S ¼ dQ Sdt ¼ zFdn Sdt ¼ zFr ¼ zFkC (2:33)\nwhere k is the constant of the reaction rate, I is partial cathodic (anodic) current (A), S is entropic contribution (J/K), and C is the concentration of the reactants (mol/L). Arrhenius equation gives:\nk ¼ Aexp ΔG 6¼\nRT\n(2:34)\nwhere A is a pre-exponential factor and ΔG6¼ is activation energy for a chemical reaction. The changes in the activation energy of the oxidation and reduction reaction in an electrochemical process are in a reverse waywhen the electrode polarization takes place. The anodic polarization decreases the activation energy of the oxidation reaction while the reduction reaction has increased activation energy, thus resulting in high rate of\noxidation reaction and large anodic current 8 . The shift of the electrode potential with η leads to the energy change of a single electron with Fη. If we define the decreased activation energy by using an anodic charge-transfer coefficient (1 α), the polarized activation energy in anodic reaction (ΔG 6¼a ) is smaller than the nonpolarized activation energy (ΔG6¼oa ) by an amount of (1 α)Fη. The cathode polarization increases the cathodic activation energy (ΔG6¼c ) by αFη in comparison with the nonpolarized energy ( ΔG 6¼oc ), where α is termed as the cathodic charge-transfer coefficient (dimensionless). The charge-transfer coefficient signifies the fraction of the overpotential that helps in lowering the free energy barrier for an electrochemical reaction, thus a change in the rate constant for a charge-transfer reaction.\nΔG6¼a ¼ ΔG6¼oa 1 αð ÞFη (2:35)\nΔG 6¼c ¼ ΔG 6¼oc þ αFη (2:36) The substitution of the activation energy expressed in Eqs.

From the linear relation in Tafel plot, the charge-transfer coefficient from the slope and exchange current by the linear interpolation to the equilibrium potential is then obtained. By using Taylor series expansion to the Butler–Volmer equation, overpotentials presenting slopes smaller than one-third of the Tafel slope display nearly linear relationship between 8 and η, while overpotentials with slopes larger than half of the Tafel slope have the large net current dominated by the anodic/cathodic reactions.\nThe fast change in electrode potential or overpotentials leads to a decrease in the thickness of the diffusion layer and as a result, a higher current. In an electrochemically reversible electron transfer process accompanied with freely diffusing redox species, the peak currents 8p (A) increase linearly with the square root of the scan rate υ (V s\n1) in a cyclic voltammetry technique according to the Randles–Sevcik equation in Eq.

Randles–Sevcik equation is used to describe a diffusion-controlled reaction. For a reaction of the diffusion process, the deviation from linearity in the plots of 8p versus υ0.5 suggests that either the electrochemical reaction is quasi-reversible, or partial electron transfer takes place via the surface-adsorbed species, or both [5].\n74 W.

      "text" : "The basic requirement for a cathode material in LIBs is high free energy of Li+ ions and low free energy of electrons in comparison with the anode materials, then the difference in the chemical potentials of both sides establishes a working voltage [8]. The well-known cathode materials mainly process two mechanisms to host the Li+ ions, namely intercalation and conversion. Basically, the research in cathodic host materials started from the 1970s when a variety of chalcogenides, such as titanium disulfide (TiS2), work as the cathode and metallic lithium as anode producing a limited cell potential of 2.5 V versus Li+/Li [9]. Later, manganese and vanadium oxides were investigated. The pioneering work by Goodenough and coworkers invented layered lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) and spinel lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) as cathode materials for lithium rechargeable batteries in the 1980s and the cell voltage extended above 4 V versus Li+/Li [10, 11]. After the release of reversible lithium insertion into graphite by Yazami and Touzain [12], the development of lithium-ion batteries using graphite anode and lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) cathode by Sony Inc. led to the successful commercialization of lithium-ion batteries in the 1990s. Thereafter, many other layered transition metal oxides including lithium nickel dioxide (LiNiO2), lithium manganese dioxide (LiMnO2), and vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) were developed as potential alternatives to the LiCoO2 cathode. Goodenough and coworkers [13] then reported a polyanion framework material, namely lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), as prospective cathode material which has been commercialized by A123 Inc. and Sony Inc. Lithium iron phosphate displays appealing advantages in environmentally benign, low cost, very stable electrochemical properties with structural stability, high thermal stability, and a distinct working plateau [14]. The plots of electrochemical potentials versus specific capacity of the LIBs cathode materials are illustrated in Fig. 2.3a, and some of the commercialized cathode materials with the related properties are listed in Table 2.1. The current\n2 Understanding the Energy Storage Principles of Nanomaterials in Lithium. . . 75\nresearch focuses on cathode materials are to develop high-voltage and highcapacity materials to increase the energy density (E) of the batteries which is subjected to the reversible capacity (Q) and operating voltage (Vop).\nE ¼ QVop (2:50)\nThese intercalation compounds can be divided into several crystal structures, such as layered, spinel, olivine, and favorite, as shown in Fig. 2.3b–e, and their discharge profiles are displayed in Fig. 2.3f [15]. Among these cathode materials, NCM shows great promise in the target of high specific capacity by changing the ratio of the three transition metals. Figure 2.3g shows the phase diagram of the ternary system between LNO, LCO, and LMO with representative compositions. The number following NCM demotes the ratio of x:y:z in lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (LiNixCoyMnzO2).\nLithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM523) is a commercial cathode material with high nickel content, but the high reactive Ni4+ at the end of charge reaction leads to undesired side reactions with the electrolyte, causing gas evolution and capacity degradation. The temperature stability of the ternary cathode material decreases with an increase in nickel content, magnifying the safety issues. The high nickel content also leads to a Li/Ni cation mixing and formation of inactive phases on the electrode surface. Lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM811) in the prolonged cycling leads to cracks along the boundaries of the secondary particles, gradually increasing the surface area and active sites for parasitic reactions. The cracks formed in the cycling are observable from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images as shown in Fig. 2.3h, i, the cross section of a fresh NCM811 electrode, and after 100 cycles at C/3 at 45 C.\nConversion-type electrode materials have a solid-state redox reaction in the process of lithiation/de-lithiation, normally accompanied by the change in the crystal\n2 Understanding the Energy Storage Principles of Nanomaterials in Lithium. . . 77\nstructure and breaking/formation of chemical bonds. These cathode materials include metal halides comprising high valence metal ions and solid chalcogens including sulfur (S), selenium (Se), and tellurium (Te). Most conversion-type materials have very poor electron conductivity and moderate potential plateau as cathode materials, but their specific capacities are relatively high, up to 1675 mAh g 1 for sulfur [15].\nNanotechnologies for the synthesis of cathode materials have been widely used to control the morphology and dimension of the products. The synthetic methods mainly include freeze drying, template-direct growth, solvothermal and hydrothermal, supercritical fluid synthesis, ionothermal method, biosynthesis, solid-state reaction, and coprecipitation, but in a practical process, some of these methods are usually combined together. Figure 2.4a shows the SEM images of porous and hollow microspheres of lithium manganese nickel cobalt oxide (Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.1Co0.1O2) in the synthetic process and Fig. 2.4b schematically explains the route. The precursor solutions coprecipitate the manganese(II) carbonate (MnCO3) nanoparticles and the following calcination forms manganese(IV) oxide (MnO2) microspheres. As the intermediate, MnO2 microspheres continue to react with lithium (Li), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co) sources at high temperature to obtain the final product. The formation of the hollow structure has been explained by the nanoscale Kirkendall effect and Ostwald ripening [18]. The hollow structured Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.1Co0.1O2 displays a discharge capacity of 242 mAh g 1 at 50 mA g 1 with high Coulombic efficiency, as illustrated in Fig. 2.4c. The cobalt(II) hydroxide [Co(OH)2] hexagonal nanoplates via a coprecipitation process was used to synthesize LCO nanoplates by a solid-state reaction as shown in Fig. 2.4d1, d2 [19]. The synthesized nanoplates have a hexagonal structure with exposed (001) planes confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in Fig. 2.4d3 and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 2.4d4. The synthetic route in Fig. 2.4e keeps the exposed (001) plane of cobalt(II) hydroxide [Co(OH)2] precursor in the final product and the Li+ ion diffusion is facilitated. The as-synthesized LCO releases a discharge capacity of 140 mAh g 1 at 100 mAg 1 and 113 mAh g 1 at large current rate of 1000 mAg 1, as shown in Fig. 2.4f."

      "text" : "Anode materials act as a reductant in a reversible battery opposite to the cathode and should be in high energy level but with the low ionic energy of Li+ ions. The anode materials have been classified into three categories according to the lithiation mechanisms, namely insertion (graphite, titanium-based materials), alloying (metals, semi-metals), and conversion (MaXb, M=metal, X= O, S, F, P, N, etc., and a/b are stoichiometric mole ratios) [7]. All these anode materials have both advantages and disadvantages: insertion-type materials have high cycling stability but low capacity, alloying-type materials have large capacity but suffer the large volume changes, and conversion-type materials display large capacity but unsatisfactory cycling stability and energy efficiency [7].\n78 W.

Song and J. Chen\nmechanism takes place on metals and nonmetal substances that can form alloys with lithium metal. The alloyed compounds and intermediates have distinct crystal structures and physiochemical properties from the reactants. Conversion mechanism happens in a redox reaction by reducing the materials, e.g. CoO, with lithium and forming electrochemically inactive lithium oxide, Li2O. Thus, Li2O leads to large irreversibility in the following reactions. The conversion-type anode materials can deliver high specific capacity by reducing metal ions to zero oxidation and are usually environmentally friendly, attracting great interest for next-generation lithium battery anode materials [23]. Some metal oxides have the synergistic mechanism from alloying and conversion processes and give a large and stable performance in the lithium storage. Nanotechnologies have been widely applied in the fabrication of nanomaterials aiming to improve the electrochemical properties through the control of the size and morphologies.\nGraphite, as the most successful anode material in commercialization, has been studied extensively from both theory and experiment. However, there are still contrary understandings to the storage reaction of graphite with lithium in the transformation to graphite intercalated compound (GIC). The staged process takes place under specific potentials and a voltage of 0.2 V versus Li+/Li is usually the onset of state 4 GIC, and continuous lithiation promotes the staging reaction to stage 1 GIC. In the staging process, there are two developed mechanisms: Rüdorff model gives the sequential filling up mechanism when the lithium ions intercalate alternating graphene interlayer spaces without structure distortions. Daumas–Herold model proposes the intercalation would induce deformation around the intercalated lithium ions in the flexible graphene layers. Many in situ techniques, such as Raman spectra, have been developed to study the real-time characteristics of the graphite in the electrochemical reaction and provide insights into the mechanism of lithium storage [22]. Anode materials have been studied extensively within the structures of zero, one, two, and three dimensions, including carbon-based materials, sulfides and nitrides, metals and nonmetals, metal oxides, and polyanions.\nFigure 2.6 displays the schematic illustration of a series of hollow carbon nanostructures with high graphitization, and these structures have been used as the sulfur host in lithium-surfer batteries because of the high conductivity and affinity to sulfur [24]. Similarly, these hollow carbon hosts are also able to accommodate other low-dimensional and small-size materials to provide improved performance in the lithium storage because of the suppressed volume change within the space of hollow structures and high conductivity of the carbon matrix. In comparison with the hollow structure, double- and multi-shell structures are proposed to provide more effective confinement to the incorporated materials. Porous shells are developed to contribute large surface area with the actives in the electrolyte and hosted materials, and the porous shell and core components can provide a better electronically connectingmatrix. Despite the advantages of the above, the hollow carbon bowls are able to accommodate highdensity actives in the hollow space, beneficial for the improvement of the volumetric density of the electrode. When the structures are processed down to one dimension, the high aspect ratio can better act as an electrically conducting network in the electrode leading to improved reaction kinetics and rate capability. The continuous processing within the hollow carbon structures, such as hollow carbon fiber, can derive novel tubein-tube structures which are rich in the channels and voids for the diffusion of lithium\n2 Understanding the Energy Storage Principles of Nanomaterials in Lithium. . . 81\nions and the actives accommodation. These structures, shown in Fig. 2.6b–f, h, i, can be considered as the derivatives of hollow spheres (Fig. 2.6a) and hollow tubes (Fig. 2.6g), which can perform better in the energy storage by introducing more channels and conduction matrix.\nTo understand the benefits of the host structures to the actives in the electrochemical energy storage, we take the easily-dissoluble sulfur as an example of actives and introduce several host structures to accommodate sulfur. In Fig. 2.7a, the schematic protocol shows the steps in forming a composite owning cobalt hydroxide (CH) inner shell and a layered double hydroxide (LDH) out shell loaded with sulfur (CH@LDH/S) [25]. The corresponding TEM images of the product of each stage are displayed in Fig. 2.7b, illustrating the morphology of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67), yolk-shell ZIF-67@LDH, double-shell CH@LDH, and CH@LDH/S. The double-shell CH@LDH nanocages have abundant polar surfaces to chemically adsorb lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the complex shells are able to suppress their outward diffusion. In addition, the rich hydrophilic/hydroxy groups\nand the possible electrocatalytic properties of LDH might enhance the adsorption of the soluble LiPSs and promote to convert to the short-chain polysulfides. In the synthesis of the double-shelled CH@LDH nanocages, ZIF-67 polyhedrals are used as a sacrificial template. The reaction between ZIF-67 and nickel(II) nitrate [Ni (NO3)2] results in the hollow LDH shell-coated ZIF-67 particles (ZIF-67@LDH), which then undergoes a solution reaction with Na2MoO4 to convert to CH@LDH. A high content of sulfur (75 wt%) is then loaded into CH@LDH matrix via the meltdiffusion method to form CH@LDH/S and this as-prepared double-shell composite has displayed significantly improved cycling stability in the lithium storage [25].\nFigure 2.7c displays a schematic illustration of one-dimensional (1D) hollow carbon fiber (HCF) filled with MnO2 nanosheets (MnO2@HCF). This 1D HCF has a high aspect ratio and conductivity, plus the holes enhancing the porosity, together with facilitating both ion and electron conduction in the electrochemical reaction. The inner MnO2 nanosheets provide strong chemical adsorption for LiPSs and effectively prevent the dissolution [26]. Hollow nanospheres with highly conductive shells composed of titanium monoxide (TiO) nanoparticles and a thin carbon layer (TiO@C-HS) have been prepared as the sulfur host (Fig. 2.7d) [27]. The shell is highly conductive and about 20 nm in thickness (see Fig. 2.7e). After the melt diffusion, the hollow space is filled up with sulfur with a high content of 70 wt%. TiO@C-HS/S thick electrode with a high sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm 2 can deliver high specific capacities at different current densities with a stable cycling performance (Fig. 2.7f). In this protocol, a polar and highly conductive host has been developed for effective accommodating of sulfur.\nHollow nanostructures with multi-level architectures have been attracting great interest in the fabrication of the anode materials in hierarchical structures because of the outstanding buffering to the volume variation in the electrochemical reaction and improved tap density by utilizing the inner cavities in a hollow space, in comparison with the single-shell hollow structures [28]. Multi-level hollow nanostructures including yolk-shell, multi-shell, and multi-chamber structures have been proposed and prepared for the use of energy storage [29]. These complex structures make better use of the inner hollow space and effectively increase the fraction of the electrochemical actives. These multi-level skeletons have strong structural stability [30] to ensure a high capacity retention in the long-term charging-discharging cycles. The widely used synthetic strategies for the hollow nanostructures mainly include Ostwald ripening, nanoscale Kirkendall effect, hard and soft templating method, spray pyrolysis, and heterogeneous contraction.\nFigure 2.8a, b displays the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the yolk-shell nanoprisms of nickel cobalt (Ni0.37Co) oxide by a thermally driven heterogeneous contraction reaction. The prism has a pyramid-shaped apex at both ends, and the yolk-shell nanoprisms compose of numerous polycrystalline nanoparticles. The galvanostatic cycling of the as-prepared nanoprisms in Fig. 2.8c indicates that a high reversible capacity of 1028.5 mAh g 1 over 30 cycles at 200 mAh g 1 is maintained implying high stability of the electrodes [31]. The hard-templating method is common to fabricate the hollow structures and carbonaceous material (CM)-based templates are widely used to form multiple shells\n2 Understanding the Energy Storage Principles of Nanomaterials in Lithium. . . 83\nand chambers. As shown in Fig. 2.8d, the adsorption and penetration of metal precursors take place in the porous carbon structures usually with rich functional groups to form metal glycolates (CH2(OH)COO\nM+). The subsequent annealing in the air combusts the carbon template and oxidizes the metal precursors to metal oxides where the temperature gradient along the radial direction in the annealing process results in the gradual removal of carbon and formation of a multi-shell hollow structure. The structure parameters of the products such as the shell number, shell thickness, porosity, and chemical composition can be tuned by the control of metal ion concentration, solvent category, pH value, annealing temperature and rate, reaction atmosphere, etc. TEM images in Fig. 2.8e–g clearly display the identical multi-shell hollow spheres of binary metal oxides (CoMn2O4, Co1.5Mn1.5O4, and MnCo2O4) from the penetrationsolidification-annealing protocol.\nThe self-templating method has been extensively used to synthesize complex hollow structures by using the self-engaged templates which are usually the inorganic/organic hybrids composed of metal ions and clusters. Figure 2.8h displays the cobalt sulfide (CoS4) nanobubble-composed hollow prisms prepared through a two-step diffusioncontrolled process in the conversion from cobalt acetate hydroxide nanoprisms to ZIF-67 hollow prisms and subsequent sulfidation reaction to form CoS4 bubble-like particles [32]. The annealing process preserves the prism morphology and forms interconnected CoS2 nanobubbles, as shown in Fig. 2.8i. The as-obtained CoS2 displays extraordinary reversible rate capabilities at current densities ranging from 0.2 to 5 Ag 1 (Fig. 2.8j). The chemical compositions of the shells can be manipulated in the synthesis, and the hybridization of two electrochemically active components in one composite can contribute extra benefits to structural stability, conductivity, and electrochemical activity. Multi-shell Co3O4@Co3V2O8 nanoboxes are fabricated by controlling the amount of vanadium oxytriisopropoxide (VOT, [OV(OCH(CH3)2)3]) in the reaction with cubic ZIF-67 precursors [33]. In the annealing process, the intermediates of ZIF-67 nanocubes with the cobalt vanadium oxide (Co3V2O8) shell are transformed into double-shell (D) and triple-shell (T) Co3O4@Co3V2O8 nanoboxes (D-Co3O4@Co3V2O8 and T-Co3O4@Co3V2O8), displayed by the TEM images in Fig. 2.8k, l. As evidenced from the elemental mapping results in Fig. 2.8m, the shells have different chemical compositions with a Co3V2O8 outermost shell and two Co3O4 inner shells in T-Co3O4@Co3V2O8. The nanoprocessing of structures is as expected, helping to enhance the lithium storage properties resulting from a synergistic effect from the complex configurations and compositions [29].\nFig. 2.7 (a) Schematic illustration of the step-by-step synthesis of cobalt hydroxide (CH) inner shell and a layered double hydroxides (LDH) out shell loaded with sulfur (CH@LDH/S) composite from zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67), to the yolk-shell ZIF-67@LDH, double-shell (D) CH@LDH and CH@LDH/S as the transmission electron microscope (TEM) shown in (b).

      "text" : "The development in the physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials and the improved understanding of their synthesis, characterization, and electrochemistry lead to a breakthrough in the field of supercapacitors for energy storage. The principle of supercapacitors is elucidated in terms of the resulting electrochemical characteristics and charge storage mechanisms, i.e., double-layer capacitance or pseudocapacitance. The electrochemical behaviors and charge storage mechanisms are also dependent on the size or thickness; notwithstanding, the materials may be electrically insulating semiconductors. There are increasing numbers of electrode materials, such as transition metal oxides, hydroxides, conducting polymers, etc., that display electrochemical characteristics neither purely capacitive nor purely Faradaic [2]. Before introducing the electrode nanomaterials of the two types of charge storage mechanisms, we use the band theory for semiconductors and electrochemical characteristics in i-V and V-t curves to understand the origin of the capacitance and the principle.\nElectron transfer takes place in electronically interactive or separated redox-active centers, highly depending on the electron conductivity of materials. The electrons in the outer most orbit of an atom experience least attraction force by the nuclei and have high kinetic energy. In Fig. 2.9a, the separated and noninteractive atoms have electrons in the atomic orbits, and these orbits form a discrete set of energy levels. The low-energy levels are filled with electrons with fixed energy level, while the high-energy levels are empty. In a molecule composed of two atoms, the original atomic orbits are split into separate molecular orbits of different energy levels. The amount of molecular orbits is determined by the atomics, p, d, or f orbits, that are occupied by electrons [34]. The molecular orbits of low-energy levels are occupied by electrons and of high-energy levels are empty. When a number of atoms are brought together into a molecule, the electrons of one atom experience forces of other atoms and this effect is the most pronounced on outer most orbits. These atomic orbits split into separate molecular orbitals of different energy. When a large number of atoms (1020 or more) are brought together to form a solid, the orbital number is extremely large and the difference in energy between these orbits becomes small. These energy levels form continuous bands rather than the discrete energy levels of the atoms in isolation. The intervals of energy levels containing no orbits form band gaps between the highest level of one band and the lowest level of the next.\nThe core bands composed of core-level orbits (both the bonding and antibonding levels) are completely populated, so they have small overlapping in molecules and thus little contribution to bonding. The valence orbits of adjacent atoms have strong\nFig. 2.8 (continued) MnCo2O4 hollow spheres. Scale bars are 500 nm.

In valence orbits, the bonding orbits have energy lower than the atomic orbits, mostly in-phase, but each of the bonding orbits still has slightly different energies. The antibonding orbits show an increase in energy compared with the atomic orbitals, mostly out-of-phase, and each of the antibonding orbits also has little difference in energy. These energy levels for all the bonding orbitals and antibonding orbits are so close that they form valence band and conduction band, respectively. In most existing solids, the valence band is partially occupied by the valence electrons resulting from the original atomic orbits that are not fully occupied. The valence electrons are able to move through the occupied and unoccupied orbits contributing to semiconductivity, which are delocalized in the valence band [34]. The degree of delocalization of electrons or the zone sizes is the typical difference in metals, semiconductors, and insulators.\nThe Nernstian reaction, that the Faradaic charge transfer in isolated redox centers, takes place in solid insulators or liquid electrolytes whose valence electrons are localized. All these transferred electrons are from the orbits of the same or very close energy level but different redox centers; thus, the electron transfer occurs at potentials in a very narrow range close to the equilibrium potential. This results in\ncurrent peaks in the cyclic voltammograms and potential plateaus in galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles. When these redox centers have a strong interaction with each other in the valence band, which might be due to the short separation or high conductivity or both, their energy states are so close to merge together into a broadband. In this case, the electron transfer at these energy states is continuous over a wide range of potentials, leading to a constant current flow. For pseudocapacitance, each electron in the band model is explained to transfer to a particular energy level shared by many atoms. There is no fixed stoichiometry between the number of electrons and the compensated species over a potential range.\nElectrochemical characteristics of electrode materials mainly including i-V and V-t curves provide real-time reaction information in the specific electrolyte solution. As explained for the charge-storage mechanisms in electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitor from surface redox reaction, the capacitortype responses should have rectangular cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 2.10a, b) and linear voltage response at constant current (Fig. 2.10c). In contrast, battery-type responses have prominent and widely separated peaks in cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 2.10g, h) and nonlinear voltage profiles with characteristic plateaus associated with the redox reactions of the active centers. The redox peaks of a battery reaction can be widened by enlarging the electrochemically active surface area with increased contribution from Faradaic charge-transfer reaction (see Fig. 2.10g). As a result, the voltage-time profile should have a degenerated voltage plateau, which is neither a battery nor a capacitor response. An intermediate behavior between these two extremes indicates the pseudocapacitance from intercalation, as shown in Fig. 2.10d–f. Niobium oxide (Nb2O5) in organic electrolyte has displayed a welldefined intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism by lithium ions and MXenes show reversible redox peaks in the same reaction mechanism. The judgment of a material whether belonged to battery-type or capacitor-type can follow this information: (i) electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and surficial pseudocapacitance should have rectangular i-V curves and triangular-shape charge-discharge profiles; (ii) intercalation pseudocapacitance should display reversible redox peaks although these peaks may be pronounced [6]; (iii) the kinetic parameter, b in the equation i = avb correlating peak currents and sweet rates of potentials, is 1 implying a capacitive material while 0.5 denoting battery material of a semi-infinite diffusion. Any value far from 1 and 0.5 indicates a mixing reaction mechanism from capacitive and diffusion process. These characteristics in electrochemistry are highly dependent on the material type (e.g., metal, metal oxide, etc.), reaction system, and the size and state (e.g., thin film) of materials."

      "text" : "Electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) store charges at an electrode–electrolyte interface when a voltage bias is applied. The maximum capacitance of EDLC is on the order of hundreds of farads per gram, which is numbers of magnitude larger than that of a traditional dielectric capacitor of which the capacitance is only microfarad\n2 Understanding the Energy Storage Principles of Nanomaterials in Lithium. . . 89\nper gram. A large capacitance is achievable when the charge separation distance is extremely short (<1 nm) at the electrode–electrolyte interface, and the electrode materials have an exceptionally high specific surface area (SSA) which is key to lead to a high gravimetric capacitance and hence high energy density. The highest energy densities of the commercial EDLC using high-SSA activated carbons are nevertheless still below 12 Wh kg 1, much smaller than that of Li-ion batteries. Carbon nanomaterials including carbon nanotubes activated carbon and graphene are typical electrode materials in EDLC and have been widely studied because of their high specific surface area and excellent electrical and mechanical properties. The research now is focusing on increasing the energy density of the carbon nanomaterials in EDLC without sacrificing the power density and cycle life.\nCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising electrode materials in supercapacitors as a result of their high aspect ratio, large specific surface area (SSA), and high electrical conductivity. A free-standing mat composed of entangled multiwall nanotubes (MWNTs) has been reported to have a specific capacitance of 102 F g 1 with a power density above 8 kW kg 1 and an energy\ndensity of 1 Wh kg 1 in hydrosulfuric acid (H2SO4) electrolyte [35]. A higher specific capacitance of 180 F g 1 was achieved on the single-wall nanotube (SWNT) distributed in a random network (Fig. 2.11a) working in potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte [37] and the maximum power density and energy density are 20 kW kg 1 and 10 Wh kg 1, respectively. Contrary to the random entanglement of CNTs, the vertically aligned CNT (VA-CNT) arrays have been fabricated with vertically aligned tubes and well-defined tube spacing, as shown in Fig. 2.11b, c [38]. This arrangement allows more contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, thus enhancing the participation in the charging/ discharging process of each aligned tube (Fig. 2.11d). Furthermore, the etching processing such as the plasma can open the top caps of these VA-CNTs (see Fig. 2.11e–g), and the access to the inner cavity of these tubes by electrolyte has greatly improved the properties in energy storage [39]. In the opening of the tube tips, plasma etching also introduces defects and oxygenated functionalization to the surface of the nanotubes, enhancing the capacitive behavior by combining the double-layer capacitance and redox pseudocapacitance. As shown in Fig. 2.11h, the aligned carbon nanotubes with excellent contact with the current collector and rich active area reacting with the ionic liquid electrolyte have displayed a high cell voltage (4 V), high specific energy (148 Wh kg 1), and high specific power (315 kW kg 1) [36], which might be the delegate of the high-performance supercapacitor and exceed the current electrochemical capacitor technology.\nGraphene, a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice structure of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms covalently bonded along the single atomic planar sheet [40], has aroused tremendous interest due to its intrinsic characteristics such as physical [41–43], mechanical [44], and electrical properties [40, 45, 46] since the discovery of its freestanding form in 2004. The sp2 bonds formed by s, px, and py atomic orbitals hybridization can result in 120 C C-C bond angles and the honeycomb layers. Also the remaining pz orbital on each carbon could overlap with its neighboring carbons to form π bonds. The valence band and conduction band consist of π orbitals and anti-bonding π orbitals and the cross of bands gives rise to Dirac points K and K0 per Brillouin zone [47]. So far, many protocols including mechanical exfoliation [40], epitaxial growth [48], chemical vapor deposition [49, 50], and oxidation-exfoliation reduction of graphite [51, 52] have been developed for the synthesis of graphene.\nFree-hanging graphene is the thinnest conceivable nanocarbon, and, in particular, as a result of the overlarge surface area and mechanical strength [53–55], graphene has been considered promising for energy storage [42, 49, 56–59] including rechargeable lithium-ion batteries [60, 61], supercapacitors [62–64], and fuel cell devices [65]. In comparison with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), graphene exhibits an electrical conductivity ~64 mS cm 1, approximately 60 times higher [45] and owns an extremely high theoretical surface area (2675 m2 g 1) [66], twice larger than that of CNTs (1315 m2 g 1) [67]. A fast heterogeneous electron-transfer rate with an order of 0.01 cm s 1 has been found at the edges and basal plane defects of graphene [68]. These reported characteristics of graphene imply a high potential of graphene as an electrode material in supercapacitors. The intrinsic specific capacitance of monolayer graphene\n2 Understanding the Energy Storage Principles of Nanomaterials in Lithium. . . 91\nwas found as 21 μF cm 2, equal to 561 F g 1 if the theoretical surface area (2675 m2 g 1) could be used sufficiently, setting the upper limit for electrical doublelayer capacitance for all carbon-based material [66]. Meunier and Ajayan et al. suggest that the specific capacitance of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene and reduced graphene oxide can increase to 80 and 394 μF cm 2 [69]. However, a variety of graphene-based materials derived from graphene oxide (GO) indicated unsatisfied electrochemical behaviors [70], mainly attributed to the restacking of graphene sheets during processing via the sheet-to-sheet van der Waals interaction.\nNone-restacking curved graphene [71], solvated graphene [72], and laserscribed graphene [62] have been obtained which show the enhanced performance of 154, 215, and 265 F g 1, respectively. Ajayan et al. use a laser writing technique to directly convert graphene oxide (GO) to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) within a porous structure (Fig. 2.12a) by decomposing the functional\ngroups and adsorbed water molecules [70]. The patterned in-plane and sandwich designs are formed in rGO-GO-rGO configuration by using GO with a substantial amount of water, as the ionic conductor but electrical insulator. The microsupercapacitors show the highest capacitance of 0.51 mF cm 2 for the in-plane structure, nearly twice larger than that of the sandwich structure, resulting from the anisotropic nature of ion mobility and transport distances. Kaner et al. reported a method to reduce GO by the laser using a LightScribe compact disk/ digital video disk (CD/DVD) optical drive, and the resulted graphene has an extremely high conductivity of 1738 S m 1 and specific surface area (SSA) of 1520 m2 g 1 [62]. Supercapacitor devices with the as-prepared graphene as electrodes exhibit ultrahigh energy density values in different electrolytes of aqueous, organic, and ionic liquid and maintain a high power density in the long-term cycling. The high flexibility of the material and device implies the potential use in high-power, flexible electronics. Ruoff et al. studied the capacitive behavior of graphene in terms of the layer number, from one to five (see Fig. 2.12b). The quantum capacitance effect near the point of zero charge makes the capacitance suppressed near neutrality, and the correlation between the electrode and electrolyte enhances the capacitance only when the thickness is below few layers. They prepared an activated graphene oxide (AGO) with the super-high surface area (3100 m2 g 1) via the activation with potassium hydroxide (KOH) by microwave [75], and AGO with a three-dimensional porous structure presented high specific capacitance (150~200 F g 1). The enhanced electrochemical performance of AGO is due to its two-dimensional plane and produced edge planes which have much high electron transfer kinetics over the basal [76]. The oxygen-functional groups at the edges of graphene sheets cause a controversial electrochemistry influence [63, 77], not only on the heterogeneous electron transfer rate but also on the adsorption/desorption of molecules [67, 78]. To understand the factors arising from graphene structure that affect the electrochemical results, the electrochemical characteristics of GO, RGO, AGO, and reduced AGO (RAGO) were prepared through a top-down method, as shown in Fig. 2.12c [74]. Graphene oxide was prepared by Hummers method [79] and chemically activated to AGO in situation A (SA), with smaller GO fragments and a larger ratio of edge to basal plane, then going to situation B (SB), with pore defects and higher specific surface area (SSA). The approximate monocrystalline characteristic of GO is transformed to polycrystalline after activation, demonstrating that the activated defects have distorted the crystalline structure of graphene oxides. RGO and RAGO were synthesized via chemical reduction by hydrazine monohydrate using GO and AGO as precursors, respectively. As represented in Fig. 2.12d, the ratio of edge plane to basal plane [63, 76], defects involving edge defects and pore defects, chemical impurities of metal oxides and surfactant [80, 81], oxygen-functional groups [63, 77], and the underlying supporting electrode [76] are key factors to influence the electrochemistry of a graphene supercapacitor. The edge ratio, SSA, edge defects, and metal impurities\n2 Understanding the Energy Storage Principles of Nanomaterials in Lithium. . . 93\nFi g .2\n.1 2\n(c on\ntin ue d)\n94 W. Song and J. Chen\ncould cause a positive impact while the basal/pore defects, oxygen-containing groups, and surfactant impurities could have a negative impact on the electrochemical properties. Optimization of the electrode material is crucial to improving the electrochemical performance of the carbon materials since more than one structure role of the material would cause variation in the electrochemical behaviors."

      "text" : "In comparison with the carbon materials which mainly contribute double-layer capacitance, the pseudocapacitive electrode materials are highly interesting and the current studied pseudocapacitor materials include metal oxides, metal carbide or MXenes, metal sulfides, metal nitrides, layer hydroxides, and conducting polymers. However, most pseudocapacitive materials suffer from high resistance for electron and/or ion transfer, setting restriction to their capacity, rate capability, and cyclability. Nanotechnologies have offered to enable rational designs to optimize the structure and size of these materials leading to an improvement in the performance of energy storage.\nPseudocapacitors store charges through the transfer of charge between electrode and electrolyte, and the resulted pseudocapacitance (Cpc) is proportional to the amount of the charge transferred, which is described in the following equation [82, 83]:\nCpc ¼ Q dθ=dVð Þ (2:51) where Q is the Faradaic charge required for adsorption/desorption of ions, dθ is the change in fractional surface coverage, and dV is the change in potential. The value of dθ/dV is not always linear in a voltage range; the capacitance is thus not always constant and termed as pseudocapacitance [84]. The Faradaic process of pseudocapacitors that can result in pseudocapacitance comprises three mechanisms, as illustrated in Fig. 2.13: (i) underpotential deposition, (ii) redox pseudocapacitance, and (iii) intercalation pseudocapacitance. Underpotential deposition is\nFig. 2.12 (a) Patterning reduced graphene oxide-graphene oxide-reduced graphene oxide (rGO-GO-rGO) electrode with in-plane and sandwich configuration by laser.

The redox pseudocapacitance occurs in the surface redox reaction by electrochemical adsorbing ions on/near the electrode surface and transferring electrons at the redox active sites. The intercalation pseudocapacitance arises from the electrochemical intercalation of electroactive species in the layered structure of the electrodes without crystallographic phase change. Both the redox and intercalation pseudocapacitance is more popular in the development of pseudocapacitors and their faradaic reactions are very fast without ionic diffusion limitation, which is distinctive from the solid-state diffusion process in batteries. In the following content, we mainly introduce the development of pseudocapacitive materials owning redox and intercalation pseudocapacitance.\nRuthenium oxide (RuO2) is a typical redox-reaction pseudocapacitive electrode material and has been extensively studied in an acidic electrolyte, giving the reaction mechanism as shown in Eq. (2.52). The charge/discharge process enables the rapid reversible electron transfer which is compensated by the electroabsorption of protons on the surface of RuO2, and the oxidation states vary from Ru +2 to Ru+4:\nRuO2 þ xHþ þ x e$ RuO2 x OHð Þx (2:52) Ruthenium oxide (RuO2) has high conductivity and this property enables a large utilization of the materials in the electrochemical reaction. The highest capacitance of the hydrated RuO2 was reported to be 1340 F g\n1, close to its theoretical value of 1400 F/g (Fig. 2.14a) [85]. The advantages in high conductivity and reversibility of RuO2 in the electrochemical reaction allow a high-rate capability in charge storage. As displayed in Fig. 2.14b, the capacitance retains 75% when the scan rate increases from 2 to 500 mV s 1. Although RuO2 has a promising performance in the electrochemical energy storage, the high toxicity and cost restrict the large-scale use of RuO2. Other transition metal oxides have\nbeen intensively studied as alternatives to RuO2 in the application of supercapacitors. Most transition metal oxides are semiconductors and suffer the poor electrical conductivity, causing low charge-transfer kinetics and sluggish ion diffusion in the redox reaction. Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is another typical metal oxide giving pseudocapacitance but the thick electrodes usually give low capacitance ranging between 200 and 250 F g 1. The nanosizing thin film of MnO2 dramatically increases the capacitance to large than 1000 F g\n1 resulting from the enhanced ion-accessible surface area. To figure out the shortage of electronic conduction, compositing with conductive matrix has been a popular method. Figure 2.14c shows the TEM images of a composite of nanocrystalline MnO2 distributed in the nanoporous gold (NPG) matrix. The electron transfer of this composite is facilitated and the resulted capacitance is as high as 1145 F g 1 approaching the theoretical value of MnO2 (see Fig. 2.14d). MnO2 nanoflowers were reported to grow on the flexible NPG wires, which own enhanced electronic/ionic conduction. The absence of binder in this electrode also benefits the activation of electrode materials in reaction. Figure 2.14e displays an NPG@MnO2 structure scrolled by CNT/carbon paper for use in all-solid-state, highly flexible supercapacitors. This supercapacitor has a high voltage of 1.8 V in the charge/discharge process, delivering a high energy density of 5.4 μWh cm 2 and a maximum power density of 2531 μW cm 2 (see Fig. 2.14f). Intercalation-type electrode materials and related electrochemical reaction mechanisms have been reviewed [84], including metal oxides (anatase titania (TiO2), hydrogen titanate, niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5), lithium titanate spinel oxide (Li4Ti5O12), sodium titanate spinel oxide (Na2Ti3O7) etc.), metal carbide (MXenes etc.), and metal sulfide (VS2 etc.). Metal carbides (MXenes) are novel electrode materials recently developed for supercapacitors. As illustrated in Fig. 2.15a, they are prepared by selective etching of element A from the layered MAX structures, where M is a transition metal (titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), etc.), A represents a main-group element (aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), indium (In), tin (Sn), etc.), and X is carbon (C) and/or nitrogen (N) [86]. Metal carbide (MXenes) consists of two-dimensional conductive carbide layers with hydrophilic surface rich in hydroxyl groups, which benefit the electrochemical reaction and electron conduction. Gogotsi et al. [87] demonstrated that a variety of cations including lithium (Li+), sodium (Na+), magnesium (Mg2+), potassium (K+), ammonium (NH4\n+), and aluminum (Al3+) ions can spontaneously intercalate into the Ti3C2Tx layers, where T denotes the surface termination (oxygen (O), hydroxide (OH), and/or florine (F)) and x is the number of termination groups. The ionic intercalation is able to be promoted by electrical bias, for large ions, such as Al3+. Figure 2.15b [87] shows a flexible, additivefree, and conductive Ti3C2Tx paper electrode, which has been prepared through the filtering of the delaminated titanium carbide (Ti3C2). This electrode has nearly doubled the gravimetric capacitance in potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte in comparison with the multilayer Ti3C2Tx. The volumetric capacitance of this electrode is ultrahigh, 340 F cm 3, as shown in Fig. 2.15c. The in situ XRD study, illustrated in Fig. 2.15d [87], reveals that the intercalation and\n98 W.

The change in the interlayer distance is only 0.33 Å when the potential shifts from 1 to 0.2 V in a potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte. The capability of hosting larger Na+, K+, NH4\n+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Al3+ ions than Li+ ions would greatly extend the application of MXenes in a range of energy storage devices.\nLevi et al. [88] have adopted electrochemical quartz-crystal admittance (EQCA), in situ electronic conductance, and electrochemical impedance spectrum to study the intercalation kinetics of MXenes and conjectured that the multilayers consist of shallow-adsorption sites near the edges and deep-adsorption sites of higher activation energies in the interior. Gogotsi et al. [89] prepared Ti3C2Txbased paper electrodes by mixing Ti3C2Tx with carbon nanotubes or polymers, which have high mechanical and electrochemical properties (see Fig. 2.15e, f). A sandwich-like MXene/CNT paper electrode was similarly constructed and exhibited a high gravimetric capacitance of 150 F g 1 and volumetric capacitance of 390 F cm 3 at a scan rate of 2 mV s 1 (Fig. 2.15g). KOH was introduced into the Ti3C2Tx/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film [90] and the dramatic improvement in the layered structure has greatly improved the ionic transport, with a high volumetric capacitance of 528 F cm 3 at 2 mV s 1 and 306 F cm 3 at 100 mV s 1 (Fig. 2.15h). Metal carbides (MXenes) have displayed both high gravimetric and volumetric capacitance in the supercapacitors and are promising as the electrode materials for high-energy and power devices for energy storage.\nMetal carbides (MXenes) have been studied as electrode materials in the nonaqueous devices for energy storage, such as lithium-ion and sodium-ion capacitors. An asymmetric lithium-ion supercapacitor [91] assembled with titanium carbide (Ti2C) as an anode and activated carbon as cathode delivered a superior specific energy of 239.5 Wh kg 1 at the ultrahigh specific power of 10.8 kW kg 1. Yamada et al. [92] demonstrated that in a hybrid sodium-ion supercapacitor, titanium carbide (Ti2C) nanosheets delivered a reversible capacity of 175 mAh g 1 at an operating voltage of 1.3 V (vs. Na/Na+) and good cycle stability. The hybrid sodium-ion capacitor using sodium iron sulfate (Na2Fe2(SO4)3) as cathode and titanium carbide (Ti2C) as anode owns a high working potential of 2.4 V and high specific energy of 260 Wh kg 1 at the ultrahigh specific power of 14 kW kg 1 (based on the weight of Ti2C anode).\nFig. 2.15 (continued) of the paper.

      "text" : "Nanomaterials, thanks to the large progress of nanoscience and nanotechnologies, have exhibited great advantages in improving the electrochemical properties of the energy storage and conversion devices. These merits are mainly due to the optimized properties in nanoscale by offering high surface area, large surface-to-volume ratio, high conduction property, altered physical and electronic properties, and confinement effects in nano dimensions. Nanoparticulate electrodes or electrocatalysts are able to lead to high contact area at the interface of electrode/electrolyte, hence the high rate in the electrode reaction. Nanotubes have a high surface-to-volume ratio and display high reactivity in the electrochemical reactions with this particular morphologies. These advantageous nano effects of nanomaterials originate from the methodologies to manipulate and control materials at the atomic or molecular level and the understanding of the synthesis protocol from nanoscale. Nanomaterials have been designed with a specific target in use through a variety of ways, such as morphology fabrication, electronic structure doping, nanosizing, compositing, etc.\nA growing number of materials and materials of different structures have been proposed to be used in the electrochemical systems to enhance the performance in energy storage and supply. For example, the carbon nanotubes have been used in lithium-ion batteries as a three-dimensional conductivity network, greatly enhancing the high-rate and cycling performance. However, there are still some issues related to the electrochemical systems by using nanomaterials. The fundamental understanding of the energy chemistry in the process of energy storage and conversion on the nanostructured materials is still far more enough. The scarce knowledge of the relationship between the structure and performance of the material restrains the rational design of specifically targeted materials. There is vague understanding upon the interfacial effects and structure properties of nanomaterials in the form of hybrids or composites, as well as the resulted electrochemical behaviors. Many functional nanomaterials exhibiting high performance in energy storage and conversion have to go through a routine trial-and-error cycle to develop.\nIn addition, nanostructured materials are not perfect and still need huge development to meet the increasing demand in the energy area. No matter the materials used for lithium-ion batteries or supercapacitors, all the following aspects can be considered for further improvement of nanostructured materials in processing. The high conduction in both electrons and ions is urgent for high-rate electrochemical devices and materials can be developed by heteroatom doping, compositing with conductive networks. The downsizing of materials indeed has brought large improvement in the electrochemical performance of devices but simultaneously caused more side reactions and changed reaction mechanism. Also, effective means are still highly needed to ensure the uniformity of nanomaterials and avoid agglomeration in micro or nanoscale.\n2 Understanding the Energy Storage Principles of Nanomaterials in Lithium. . . 101"

Our dependence on fossil fuels should be changed by eco-friendlier renewable energies. Further, the generated electrical energy should be stored for improving mobile applications, being batteries the most used system for this purpose.

      "text" : "In order to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, eco-friendly renewable energies, such as wind, solar, and biomass, must be increasingly used due to global warming caused by increasing energy use and population increase [24, 171].\nThe energy produced by these systems must be stored, and batteries are the type of energy storage most used for different applications, such as consumer electronics, medical applications, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and pure electric vehicles (PEVs), among others, due to their high power and energy density [50, 68, 209]. In particular, for HEVs and PEVs, it is necessary to increase the energy density of batteries.\nThe main components of a lithium-ion battery are the two different current collectors, typically copper and aluminum, two electrodes (negative and positive), and the separator/electrolyte [192].\nThe negative electrode, anode, should present a low potential in order to provide high cell voltage with the positive electrode, cathode, that is responsible for the cell capacity and cycle life [89, 189].\nRegardless of the type of electrode, they consist of an active material, a conductive material, and a polymer binder at different ratios [69]. These three components are typically mixed in a solvent where the polymer is dissolved, and the active material and the conductive additive are dispersed to obtain good dispersion without sedimentation.\nConsidering that the active material of the cathode is primarily responsible for the battery capacity, this chapter focuses on the recent advances in the active cathode materials most commonly used in lithium-ion batteries. Further, new opportunities in this field are discussed."

      "text" : "Figure 3.1 shows a schematic representation of a battery and the main components of the electrodes. In the electrodes, each constituent has a specific function: the polymer binder has the role of binding the active material and conductive additive; the conductive additive increases the electrical conductivity of the electrode; and, in the case of the active material for the cathode, lithium ions must enter and leave repeatedly, its structure containing a readily reducible/oxidable ion [151]. In relation to the conductive additive, the most used materials are carbon black and acetylene black due to higher electrical conductivity and low cost [61].\n106 C. M. Costa et al.\nFor the polymer binder, poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, and poly(tetrafluoroethylene), PTFE, are the most used binders due to excellent mechanical strength, high chemical resistance, and high melting temperature [66, 239].\nThe active materials used for cathode development must show high reactivity with lithium, incorporation of large amounts of lithium, reversibility in lithium incorporation with structural stability, high lithium diffusion, good electrical conductivity, and insolubility in the electrolyte. The active materials most used in lithium-ion batteries are presented in Table 3.1 [139]. Table 3.1 shows the crystal system, theoretical capacity, and typical potential for each active material.\nThese active materials are synthesized by different methods including mechanochemical activation, carbothermal reduction, microwave heating, hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel synthesis, spray pyrolysis, and coprecipitation, among others, in which their morphology and size are controlled [13, 17, 72, 145, 153, 186, 256].\nIt is to notice that each synthesis method shows specific advantages and disadvantages. Thus, the hydrothermal method is very used due to its low-energy costs, low cost (relatively cheap reagents), pollution-free (closed system reaction), large dispersion (reaction time), low operating temperature (facilitates industrialization), high reaction rate (higher efficiency), and nucleation control [210].\nThe control of morphology and particle size is essential for obtaining cathode electrodes with high cycling performance, as particles of small size show shorter Li+ ion diffusion length, which can further improve Li-ion migration rate [28].\nFurther, in order to reduce the capacity fade and improve the electronic and ionic conductivity of these active materials, those structures have been doped with metal, nonmetal, or rare earth elements, among others [143, 259]."

      "heading" : "3.1.2.1 Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LiCoO2)",
      "text" : "Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) has been one of the most widely used cathode materials in commercial Li-ion rechargeable batteries, due to its good capacity retention, high structural reversibility (under 4.2 V vs. Li+/Li), and good rate capability. This active material was originally suggested by Goodenough et al. [166], and in the early 1990s, Sony Corporation commercialized it [42, 165]. The undoped LiCoO2 cathode material shows a structure along the c-axis with CoO6 octahedra separated by Li+ layers, where the LiO6 octahedra are elongated. The LiCoO2 unit cell in the hexagonal setting is composed of three layers in rhombohedral symmetry [30]. The layered LiCoO2 with the rhombohedral unit cell is characterized by a space group R3m with a = 2.8166 Å and c = 14.045 Å [211]. The\n108 C. M. Costa et al.\nlayered crystal structure of LiCoO2 with a density of 5.1 g cm 3 is ideal to accommodate lithium ions. The active material also presents magnetic properties [174]. This property led to different applications being its use in cathode material in lithium batteries one of the most promising due to the deintercalation of lithium LixCoO2 (x < 1). The experimental band gap (Eg) is about 1.7–2.7 eV [3].\nA large anisotropic volume change is verified when LiCoO2 converts to Li0.5CoO1.5 during the charging. This volume change of the host lattice is about 7% and occurs in the c-axis direction. Consequently, it is verified a peeling between the conducting material and the active material particles that results in problems in capacity fade and poor rate capability of the cathode. The main reason for this fact is due to the material dispersion into the electrolyte [165]. During the charge, the migration of Li+ ions from the layered crystal lattice causes a nonstoichiometric Li1 xCoO2 formation, and the oxidation of Co3+ changes for charge compensation [42].\nThe theoretical electrochemical capacity of LiCoO2 is around 274 mAh.g 1, but due to the instability of the structure and the limitation of Li+ removal from the hexagonal lattice (0.5), this capacity is reduced to around 140 mAh.g 1 [42].\nSome efforts have been made in order to recycle the active material [182, 275]. Zhang group used ultrasound radiation on LiCoO2 previously calcinated at 500 C in order to remove all the carbon and binder of the cathode. The treatment consists of the application of hydrothermal ultrasound radiation during 6 h (600 W) at 80 C in a concentrated solution of lithium hydroxide (LiOH). The renovated active material shows a discharge capacity retention of 99.5 and a first discharge capacity of 133.5 mAh.g 1. It is shown that after 40 cycles the electrochemical properties of commercial batteries were achieved [275].\nDifferent methods and synthesis routes, such as sol-gel [12, 65], flux-coating [165], one-step electrochemical-hydrothermal [8], combustion [200], microwave\n[84], hydrothermal [21], thermal decomposition [164], and auto flame [215], were used to produce the LiCoO2.\nIn Azib’s approach [8], thin films of LiCoO2 were synthesized via electrochemicalhydrothermal route using ethanol and water blends as a solvent. The influence of parameters such as ethanol-water ratio, pressure, temperature, current density, and reaction time was evaluated on the R3m layered phase formation and in the electrochemical response of Li batteries. The results show that well-crystalized LiCoO2 with preferred orientation (101) without traces of spinel-like phase and cobalt oxide impurities were achieved and show a capacity of around 120 mAh.g 1 [8].\nIn another study [12], thin films of LiCoO2 were prepared by spin coating deposition via a sol-gel process. The annealing temperature of 275 C shows to be effective in the crystalline nature with a preferred orientation along the (003) plane of the rhombohedral structure. Above 416 C, the material degrades. It was found that the conductivity of the samples decreases from 10 3 to 10 9 Ω 1 cm 1 and that the band gap energy decreases from 2.51 to 3.4 eV with annealing temperatures from 275 C to 475 C, respectively.\nTwo kinds of crystallographic structures of the LiCoO2 can be achieved according to the synthesis temperature. The cubic spinel structure is formed around 350 C, and around the 750 C, the layered trigonal (hexagonal) structure is formed. It is observed that the structure with the layered lattice shows a better electrochemical performance when compared with the structure with a cubic spinel lattice [42].\nNanostructured approaches have been used in order to enable buffering of the stresses caused by the volume variation, improving the electrochemical performance and the structural durability through the increased surface area and decreasing the diffusion length of lithium ions in the extraction/insertion reaction. Higher capacities at high charge/discharge rates are achieved due to the shorter diffusion pathways for ionic transport and electronic conduction [165].\nNeutron scattering of a battery with LiCoO2 during the charge/discharge process shows no difference of the active material at 25 C and 50 C operation. In the same study, it was verified that the lattice parameter c of the rhombohedral structure and cell volume increases during the discharge process (more noticeable at 25 C) [30].\nDifferent approaches to overcome the nanosized materials problems, such as particle aggregation that results in capacity fade due to low tap density and the not homogeneous distribution, were evaluated. One of these methods was the growth of an additive-free nanosized LiCoO2 crystal layer directly on the current collector [165].\nIn order to improve the overcharge of the LiCoO2 (discharge energy of 96%), a coating with AlPO4 was used, and the over-insertion tolerance maintains to over 99% of the discharge energy after ten cycles. Also, the AlPO4 coating prevents crystal structure changes and suppresses irreversible cation Li and Co exchange in the octahedral layers of the LiCoO2 during the over-insertion of Li + ions [39]."

      "text" : "Lithium manganese oxide (LiMnO2) layered structure is a very attractive material (compared to LiCoO2) from the environmental and economic perspective. This material shows two structures: orthorhombic with space group Pmmn and rhombohedral, being\n110 C. M. Costa et al.\nthe orthorhombic structure thermodynamically stable. In order to obtain the layered material, the ion-exchange technique was used. Contrary, the rhombohedral structure is thermodynamically unstable due to the low spin of the Mn3+ [244, 271]. Both of them involve distortion in the oxygen arrays from the ideal cubic close packing. The orthorhombic structure also shows the advantage of being easy to prepare and air stable, showing high capacity (285 mAh.g 1) and high potential vs. lithium. Other advantages are also observed once the reduction of manganese oxide (MnO2) does not release gases and MnO2 is a low-cost material [211]. Lithium manganese oxide batteries were first used to power calculators, memory backups, and watches. This material is the most common active material used in lithium batteries with 80% of the market share [97].\nDuring the cycling process, it is observed poor electrochemical properties and a drop in the voltage profile, due to both orthorhombic and rhombohedral LiMnO2 transformation in a spinel structure, once this phase shows low crystallinity, Mn dissolution, and large strain (Jahn-Teller activity) [271]. Jin group observed the transformation of orthorhombic lithium manganese oxide (LiMnO2) to spinel LiMnO2 phase during cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 3.3) [95, 194]. The main difficulty in obtaining layered LiMnO2 (compared with LiCoO2 and LiNiO2) is attributed to the fact the ion Mn3+ and Li+ have the closer size [194].\nIn order to stabilize the layered structure, different approaches with cation doping with aluminum (Al), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), and titanium (Ti), among others, were carried out [26].\nDifferent types of synthesis routes were used to obtain this material, including low temperature [288], high temperature [43], hydrothermal [136, 255], flux method [241], solid state [5], and quenching [117].\nThe work developed by Xiao’s group [255] reported that morphologies as rod and nanoparticles show different properties. The rods exhibit higher discharge (200 mAh.g 1) capacity and better cyclability. The nanoparticles show a capacity of 170 mAh.g 1, but after 30 cycles it decreases to 110 mAh.g 1, whereas the rods decrease from 200 to 180 mAh.g 1 after 30 cycles. The rod morphology plays an important role in the electrochemical performance once it favors the electron transport along the length pathway and accommodates the volume changes originated by the charge/discharge process.\nIn order to improve the cycle life of LiMnO2, coatings with cobalt oxide (CoO) and alumina (Al2O3) were realized. This improvement is due to the prevention of the Mn dissolution and lattice instability from the Jahn-Teller distortion [31, 32]. Other methods as doping with Boron were also used to improve cycling performance of LiMnO2 batteries, in particular at high temperatures (60 C), by the reduction of surface reaction and/or transition metal dissolution. The improvement of the B-doping on the Coulombic efficiency ranges from 69.7% in pristine LiMnO2 to 99.0% in ten at % B-doped [288]."

The spinel structure shows a high lithium extraction ratio of 0.6 (Li1 xMn2O4, 0 < x < 0.6) that provides a stable internal spinel structure and exhibits a theoretical capacity of 148 mAh.g 1 [74]. The three-dimensional (3D) crystal structure allows also the 3D lithium diffusion [173], the electronic conductivity is about 10 4 S cm 1 [185], and the Li1 xMn2O4 (0.27 < x < 1) active material can be cycled at about 4 V vs. lithium.\nThe main advantages of LiMn2O4 as a cathode in lithium batteries are the low-cost, low toxicity, and thermal stability. The extra lithiation (Li2Mn2O4) ensures a high amount of lithium-ion insertion/extraction in the structure. Therefore, the theoretical capacity of this cathode is doubled as the number of charge carrier (Li+) is also double, with respect to LiMn2O4.\nMacNeil group reported that LiMn2O4, when compared with LiCoO2 and LiNiO2, shows higher thermal stability at high temperature, when in contact with the electrolyte. This property shows that spinel LiMn2O4 suits to high power batteries [140].\nOn the other hand, the main obstacle to its commercialization is due to the fact that spinel LiMn2O4 shows significant capacity fading during the cycling and storage processes. This capacity fading at room and high temperatures are due to two main reasons: (1) the manganese (Mn) dissolution into the electrolyte and (2) the JahnTeller instability caused by the ion Mn3+ at the octahedral sites [140]. Further, at high voltages (>4.3 V) and elevated temperatures (>55 C), the capacity fade also increases. Capacity degradation of this cathode is thus mainly originated by the dissolution of the Mn ions from the interface between cathode and electrolyte and its subsequent deposition on the anode surface that increases cell impedance [29].\nThe LiMn2O4 active material can be synthesized by different synthesis routes, such as spray drying [247], hydrothermal [36], coprecipitation [227], sol-gel [278],\nand solid state [264], among others. Synthesis routes providing a fine particle size and uniform composition (such as sol-gel) lead to high electrochemical performance [265].\nEfforts to overcome/improve the electrochemical problems and high-temperature performance include ion doping [93], reducing particle sizes [265], different morphologies [254], and metal oxide coating [29].\nYi et al. [265] synthesize spinel LiMn2O4 by adipic acid-assisted sol-gel and studied the influence of the synthesis temperature (350 C, 800 C, and 900 C) on phase formation and electrochemical activity (Fig. 3.4a–d). The results show that the samples calcinated at 800 C show better ordering of the local structure, higher crystallinity, and lower lattice strain. Thus, it is possible to control the particle size by controlling the sintering temperature, the samples synthesized at 800 C showing lower lattice defects, being the Mn chemical valence closer to 3.5.\nFinally, nanoscale surface modifications have been investigated [29] (Fig. 3.4a). Xiao group [257] evaluated the effect of morphology (porous and hollow) of LiMn2O4, obtained by precipitation synthesis using manganese cobalt (MnCo3) (Fig. 3.4b) as template and manganese oxide (MnO2) as intermediate (Fig. 3.4c), in ion the electrochemical response of the cathode. It is concluded that the microspheres with a porous surface (Fig. 3.4e) exhibit a higher reversibility capacity and rate capability than the hollow surface sample (Fig. 3.4d). The current charge/ discharge of the porous structure deliver a reversible capacity of 117.2 mAh.g 1 at 1 A.g 1 and 92.1 mAh.g 1 at 10 A.g 1."

It is a member of the olivine family, crystalizes in the orthorhombic system with a Pnma [D2h] structure. Lithium ferrous (II) phosphate exhibits a distorted hexagonal close-packed oxygen framework with lithium and iron located in half the octahedral sites and phosphorous ions located in one-eighth of the tetrahedral sites. The interatomic distances are a = 10.332(4) Å, b = 6.010(5) Å, and c = 4.692(2) Å with a unit cell of 291.4(3) Å3 [81]. The bulk LiFePO4 exhibits paramagnetic (form induced magnetic fields in the direction opposite to that of the applied magnetic field) behavior at room temperature [234].\nLFP has received a singular attention as cathode active material due to its ability to reach theoretical capacities of 170 mAh.g 1 at moderate current densities and not generating oxygen under conditions such as electric overcharging and shortening [97].\nThe electrochemical extraction of lithium from the LiFePO4 active material gives (Fe2+/Fe3+) redox potential at ca. 3.5 V vs. lithium, with reversible intercalation/ deintercalation of one lithium per each LiFePO4. This active material has excellent cycling performance, the cubic lattice volume and crystal parameters slightly varying in this process, the volume variation during the lithium-ion deintercalation decreasing by 6.81%, and the density increasing by 2.59%.\nThe advantages of this material are low-cost, iron abundance in nature, no memory effect, non-toxicity, resistance to overcharge, environmental friendliness, stable voltage plateau, and improved safety compared with cobalt oxides materials\n3 Advances in Cathode Nanomaterials for Lithium-Ion Batteries 113\n[97]. Consequently, this active material is the first choice to use as a cathode in lithium batteries with medium-large capacity and medium-high power density.\nDespite this, the intrinsically low electronic conductivity (10 7–10 9 S cm 1) and low diffusion coefficient of lithium ion (10 11–10 13 cm 2 s 1) of bulk LiFePO4 result in capacity losses during the high-rate discharge. Further, comparing the olivine structure with the spinel and layered ones, the olive structure is less dense, leading to a lower volumetric energy density. The theoretical density of LiFePO4 is just 3.6 g cm\n3 which is low compared with other materials such as LiCoO2 (5.1 g cm\n3) [97], but commercial LiFePO4 exhibits a density around 1.0–1.3 g cm\n3, which shows that efforts should be taken to improve this material.\nDifferent types of synthesis techniques were used to produce the LiFePO4 particles, including microwave [266], solid-state reaction [201], template method [137], sol-gel [294], coprecipitation [11], hydrothermal [230], and mechanical activation [236], among others.\nIn order to enhance the electronic conductivity, different strategies such as the addition of carbon, surface treatment with carbon layers, substitution or doping, and reduction of particle size have been used.\nThe carbon used on the surface of LiFePO4 should be thin and not exceeding a few wt.%, with a thickness of around 3 nm. With the surface treatment, the electronic conductivity of the active material could increase up to seven orders of magnitude. This carbon layer could be reached by the addition of organic materials as a carbon precursor and is limited to cathodes with low voltage response. In high voltage cathode materials, carbon will be electrochemically oxidized in the coating process and by the highly applied potential in the charging process [271]. The carbon coating (1) provides, after deintercalation, electron channels to balance the charge of active material; (2) increases the surface area of the active material due to the carbon nanometer sized by the production of fine LiFePO4; (3) avoids the production of Fe\n3+; (4) prevents the polarization during the charge/discharge process; and (5) enhances the electronic conductivity [152, 233, 244].\nNanostructured LiFePO4 particles has been produced in order to overcome some issues such as (1) the decrease to nanosize reduces the distances for the (de)intercalation of lithium ions, decreasing the capacity fading at high current density; (2) the increase of the surface area can increase the theoretical capacity and Coulombic efficiency due to the higher lithium quantity adsorbed on the surface; (3) increases the redox reaction interface; (4) ensures a bigger electrolyte immersion, among others [244]."

The redox potential of this material is 4.8 V vs. lithium and shows a flat voltage profile. With a theoretical capacity of 167 mAh.g 1, this active material also shows a small structural volume change [35].\n3 Advances in Cathode Nanomaterials for Lithium-Ion Batteries 115\nThis material has the advantage of exhibiting a high working potential compared with LiFePO4 and a larger theoretical performance compared with LiCoO2. On the other hand, the active material intrinsically exhibits poor rate capability, low lithiumion diffusion, and low electronic conductivity (<10 9 S cm 1) due to the one-dimensional ion transport channel. The poor cyclability of this material is due to the oxidation of cobalt (Co2+ to Co3+) and also by the decomposition of the carbonated electrolyte under charging between the 4.8 and 5.1 V. This reaction contributes to low Coulombic efficiency and capacity fading during cycling.\nThe Pnma-LiCoPO4 phase is the most explored by the scientific community, but two more metastable LiCoPO4 phases, Pna21 [C2V] and Cmcm [D2h] LiCoPO4, were discovered. These two phases, in contrast with Pnma [D2h], do not exhibit any significant electrochemical performance, but both exhibit interesting magnetic properties, showing complex magnetic interactions at low temperatures that should be explored [155].\nDifferent methods were used to synthesize this active material and to obtain different electrochemical performances (Fig. 3.5), including coprecipitation, microwave, mechanochemical, hydrothermal, solid state [104], spray drying, and supercritical fluid, among others.\nIn order to form a stoichiometric LiCoPO4 without impurities, the precursor compounds used during the synthesis should have a strong Co-P bonding, preventing the formation of Co metal, lithium phosphate (Li3PO4), and cobalt oxide (Co3O4) phases [35]. Further, the synthesis performed in an argon atmosphere and carbon addition improves the conductivity of LiCoPO4 [242, 243].\nTo enhance the LiCoPO4 performance (increase electrical conductivity and rate capability), efforts in decreasing particle size [250], change morphology [156],\n116 C. M. Costa et al.\ncarbon coating [251], and lattice doping with supervalent metals ions [116] have been made. In the Wang group approach [237], it was shown that the addition of vanadium (V) improves the electrical conductivity of the active material around 5.3 times. Through carbon coating, different factors, such as carbon source, thickness, homogeneity, and carbon content, influence the electrochemical performance.\nThe nanoflake morphology was investigated by Hou group [83] with the objective of enhancing the electrochemical performance of the LiCoPO4.

With this treatment, the aggregation of particles is avoided improving the stability of the electrode material.

It exhibits an orthorhombic Pnma space group [D2h], and the typically crystallographic parameters are a= 6.106(1) Å, b = 10.452(1) Å, and c = 4.747(1) Å. With this structure stabilization, LiMnPO4 shows improved stability and safety for high operating voltage. Furthermore, manganese (Mn) and lithium (Li) occupy the octahedral 4c and 4a sites, and the P atoms occupy the 4c sites. Comparing with lithium-ion phosphate, LiMnPO4 draws the attention of the scientific community due to its higher theoretical energy density (171 mAh.g 1), higher operating voltage (4.1 V), and working within the stability window of the common nonaqueous electrolytes. Further, this cathode active material has advantages as low cost, environmentally friendlier nature, working ability at high temperatures, and non-toxicity [4].\nWhen compared with LixFePO4, LixMnPO4 presents lower electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the LiMnPO4 active material exhibits low electronic conductivity (<10 10 S cm 1), relatively poor cycling stability (Jahn-Teller anisotropic lattice distortion and interface volume strain of 8.9%), and weak lithium diffusion.\nIn order to overcome these negative properties, different methods and synthesis routes were applied to improve these drawbacks by the manipulation of its morphology/structure [292], cation distribution [252], and electrochemical properties. Hydrothermal synthesis [63], precipitation methods [45], solid-state reaction [187], template methods [134], sol-gel synthesis [195], electrospinning followed by calcination [154], and solvothermal reaction [292], among others, were used to prepare this active material.\nTo enhance the low intrinsic electronic conductivity, methods such as decrease particle size, carbon coating, and cation doping were explored. The nanoparticle approach is commonly used because with this method it is possible to improve the power rate and rate capability of the LiMnPO4 battery due to the reduction of Li + and\n3 Advances in Cathode Nanomaterials for Lithium-Ion Batteries 117\nelectron length diffusion. The carbon coating on the LiMnPO4 surface enhances electronic conductivity by the reduction of particle agglomeration and by the formation of an effective conduction network between the layer and particle. Different carbon sources such as graphene and β-cyclodextrin (C42H70O35, Heptakis (hydroxymethyl)-tetradecaoxa-octa-cyclonona-tetracontane-tetradecol) were studied. The conductivity can be also improved by the doping with heterovalent and isovalent heteroatoms through the reduction of volume between the lithiation and delithiation phases. LiMnPO4 doping with transition metals is usually used because not only it increases its conductivity but also increases or maintains its capacity. Lu group [154] studied doped Mg-LiMnPO4 with fiber morphology (Fig. 3.6) and obtained a battery performance of 135 mAh.g 1 at a C/10 rate (15 mAh.g 1) that is superior to the one of LiMnPO4.\nThis sample shows a good cyclability without capacity fading during 200 cycles and the ability for being applied in flexible batteries. Li’s team [134] designed a 3D structure binder-free LiAlO2-LiMnPO4/C cathode material with improvement in the electrochemical performance when compared with LiMnPO4/C. The sample exhibits a capacity of 105 mAh.g 1 and 98.4% of capacity retention at a high discharge rate of 10 C, after 100 cycles. This structure can solve drawbacks such as the poor conduction of the active materials."

The cell volume varies from 101 to 98.5 Å3 in the composition range 0< x< 3/4 for Li1 xNiO2, which corresponds to about 2.5% shrinkage on oxidation [183]. The lithium-ion diffusion of LiNiO2 is higher when the temperature increases, and it is described by simple ion hopping with an activation energy of 0.6 eV [180]. Some disadvantages of this material are the low capacity retention and thermal stability\n[289]. As for the other active materials, the morphology and particle size influence the cycling performance of LiNiO2 [213], smaller particles showing higher capacity, but larger particles providing higher thermal stability [121]. At room temperature, the electrical resistivity of this material is 4 Ω.cm 1 [163]. Due to the nickel (Ni) element, this active material shows magnetic properties [15], the antiferromagnetic phase (the magnetic moments related to the spins of electrons align in a regular pattern with neighboring spins pointing in opposite directions) increasing in contact with the ferrimagnetic (whose strength depends on that of the applied magnetizing field and which may persist after removal of the applied field) with nickel/lithium Ni/Li defect LiNiO2 due to increasing Li content [227]. Its electrochemical window, surface energy, and morphology were theoretically studied within the density functional theory (DFT) framework, and it was observed that tetragonal (t) Li-terminated surfaces are characterized by lower surface energies than those of the oxygen surfaces irrespective of facet direction. Further, Ni-exposed surfaces are the least stable [33]. Also, this theory was used for studying the effect of non-stoichiometry (extra-Ni-defects) on the electrochemical performance of Ni-rich layered oxides, and it was verified that extra-Ni-defects trigger a charge disproportionation reaction that reduces the Jahn-Teller distortion [114].\nOne simple synthesis of this structure is by heating a mixture of hydrated lithium hydroxide (LiOH.H2O) and nickel (II) hydroxide, Ni(OH)2 (Li/Ni = l.1/1 in molar ratio) in the range from 500 C to 900 C for 5 h in air or oxygen. It was observed that the structure prepared in an oxygen atmosphere at 700 C exhibits the highest discharge capacity of 200 mAh.g 1 in the voltage range from 3.0 to 4.3 V and the charge transfer resistance is related to the structural transformation of Lil xNiO2, 0.15< x< 0.75 [261]. Different lithium precursors have been used for obtaining this compound, lithium nitrate (LiNO3) [172, 176], LiOH.H2O [216], and Li2CO3 [232], as well as different synthesis methods, such as coprecipitation [205], emulsion [111], combustion [196], solid state [216, 218], and nanoscale MnCO3 treatment [282], among others.\nIn order to improve its thermal stability and consequently battery performance, different coatings with cobalt (Co) and manganese (Mn) [49], SiO2 [169], and vanadium (V) oxide (V2O5) [258] were carried out. The coating layer of Co, Mn particles improved the electrochemical properties of lithium nickel dioxide (LiNiO2) through decreasing the impedance growth at the interface between the electrodes/electrolyte during battery cycling [49]. It has been shown that silica (SiO2) coating at 2 wt.% leads to high structural stability and reversible capacity [169] and that a V2O5-coating layer works as hydrogen fluoride (HF) inhibitor and/or HF scavenger (from in situ precipitated cathode surface), which contributes to a significant improvement in cycling performance and storage characteristics in electrolyte [258].\nAlso for improving the electrochemical properties, this compound has been doped with iron [73], cobalt and manganese [178, 283], aluminum [149], and cerium [170]. Further, a novel inorganic nitrate salt synthesis was proposed [73].\nThe emulsion method has been used to synthesize this compound, and the optimal conditions for this synthesis were 750 C and 24 h in an oxygen stream, as represented in Fig. 3.7 [111].\n3 Advances in Cathode Nanomaterials for Lithium-Ion Batteries 119\nAluminum doping in LiNiO2 reduces lithium deficiency, stabilizes the crystal structure, and improves electrochemical cycling [149]. The doping of cerium leads to high Coulombic efficiency, high electrical conductivity, and low irreversible capacity loss [170].\nSurface modification of LiNiO2 was also achieved by the addition of titania (TiO2) or zinc (II) oxide (ZnO), and it was observed a decrease in the discharge capacity but improved cycling performance [216]."

It shows higher capacity and tap density and better thermal stability, lower cost, less toxicity, and safety in comparison to other active materials [75]. Recently, it was demonstrated that it can be used also for anode electrodes [240]. The magnetic properties of the material were evaluated, and it was verified that both frustration and disorder play important roles in the formation of a spin glass state [18]. In order to investigate the changes in its crystal structure stability, calculations were carried out through the discrete variational (DV)-Xα molecular orbital method based on the self-consistent Hartree-FockSlater model compounds. Using known symmetries (C3v) the radial function for molecular orbitals of model cluster atoms method is used to compute the energies in the order of the transition metal layer affecting the charge/discharge cycle characteristics [103]. For this compound, Ni precipitates act a redox species and change from 4+ to 2+ during charging. Further, Ni4+ becomes Jahn-Teller active Ni3+ at intermediate states during charge and Mn [168]. The analysis with in situ Auger electron spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of this compound during charging and overcharging shows that Mn is redox active below ~4.3 Vand that O becomes redox active above ~4.2 V. Ni and Co also participate in surface redox [225]. Typically, the diffusion coefficient is in the range 10 11–10 12 cm2.s 1 [274].\nThe analysis of overpotentials in this active material shows that the characteristic overpotentials during charge (delithiation) and discharge (lithiation) are state of charge (SOC) and depth of discharge (DOD) dependent, respectively [105]. It was also demonstrated that the specific capacity fades during cycling at constant specific currents can be mainly attributed to the increase of the delithiation (charge) hindrance [106].\nThis active material presents poor electronic conductivity that affects its electrochemical performance, and, therefore, different approaches have been used to improve its electric and ionic conductivity, including adding graphene, which decreases the charge transfer resistance [231], developing composition between this active material and lithium phosphor sulfur (Li3PS4) [6], and co-coating [41] and coating with lithium boron oxide glass [52] and carbon nanotubes/graphene (CNT/G) [132].\nIn all-solid-state batteries, the interface between the active material and solid electrolyte is essential for obtaining high ionic conductivity, and this interface was studied for argyrodite (Li6PS5Cl), demonstrating that the oxidation processes of the solid electrolyte do not hinder the good cyclability of the battery [7].\n3 Advances in Cathode Nanomaterials for Lithium-Ion Batteries 121\nSeveral experimental techniques have been used for synthesizing this compound such as redox synthesis [9], coprecipitation [18, 22, 80], solid-state reaction [40, 100], heating [62], pre-sintering [77], convenient rheological phase reaction [75, 191, 197], microwave pyrolysis [76], sol-gel [78], chemical vapor deposition [82], polyol medium [128], spray dry [123], using manganese (II) carbonate (MnCO3) both as a self-template and Mn source [126], acetic acid (C2H4O2) leaching and maleic acid (C4H4O4, cis-butenedioic acid) leaching [135], Pechini method [204], nitrate-melt decomposition [206], microwavemediated hydrothermal [212], high-temperature ball milling [228], hydrothermal [249], mechanochemical activation [260], combustion [268], sacrificial template [277], and combining coprecipitation with the hydrothermal method [284].\nThe preparation of this compound through the Pechini method allows reducing calcination times and minimal lithium evaporation [204].\nIn the combustion method, it was studied the effect of the addition of triethanolamine (TEA, C6H15NO3) in the synthesis, showing that synthesis with TEA exhibits lower polarization, better cycling ability, and significantly improved rate performance [268].\nIt has been shown that different carbonate precipitators affect its synthesis and consequently battery performance, the best discharge capacity value being obtained for sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) [198].\nA new synthesis process based on the sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) coprecipitation method was developed for this active material. The obtained morphology and elemental distribution are shown in Fig. 3.8a [80]. It has been also shown that using Na2CO3 as a precipitant improves the electronic conductivity of the electrode, which contributes to improved rate capability [283]. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) template was also used for the synthesis of this active material [276].\nThe chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method with sucrose as a source of carbon for the coating of this active material was developed, allowing better uniformity, higher quality, and better electrochemical performance in comparison to the thermal evaporation method [82].\nNanoplates of this active material with exposed [010] active facets were synthesized in a polyol medium (ethylene glycol, EG, C2H6O2), and these facets can lead to more channels for Li+-ion migration, resulting in an improvement in their electrochemical performance [128].\nThe impact of the different morphologies on the electrochemical performance was studied, in which highly dense materials exhibit the best power performances in terms of volumetric figures as shown in Fig. 3.8b [22].\nxLi2MnO3.(1 x)LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (x = 1/4, 1/3, and 1/2) hollow microspheres have been fabricated (Fig. 3.8c) with high specific capacity and capacity retention for x = 1/3 [129].

Among them, rechargeable lithium metal battery (LMB) has been considered as one of the most promising battery technologies that promises a great increase in energy density. Among the known anode materials, the Li metal has some unique and attractive features, such as an ultrahigh theoretical capacity (3,860 mAh g 1), a lowest negative electrochemical potential ( 3.04 vs SHE), and a low gravimetric density (0.534 g cm 1). Therefore, Li metal has rendered as\nAuthor Contribution: Dr. H. Pan designed the manuscript. Dr. B. Liu and Dr. H. Pan wrote the manuscript together.

Furthermore, a combination of Li metal with oxygen (O2) or sulfur (S) cathodes brings more viable options for the next-generation high-energy rechargeable batteries (3,505 Wh kg 1 for Li-O2, 2,600 Wh kg\n1 for Li-S batteries) with a great reduction in battery cost due to the high abundance and broad distribution of O2 and S sources. However, the use of Li metal anode in LMBs still causes some critical issues, including the well-known Li dendritic growth, uncontrolled interfacial reactions with electrolytes, and large volumetric change during Li plating/ stripping process. The “short circuit” of the battery by dendrite formation and the continuous depletion of electrolytes/active bulk lithium have been significantly challenging the practical application of rechargeable LMBs. In this chapter, we will discuss the fundamental challenges for both Li anode and cathodes and the proposed strategies for rechargeable LMBs. A perspective on the future research direction is also presented to initiate more helpful thoughts and promote to solve the critical issues in this research field."

Among various energy storage systems, rechargeable lithium (Li)-ion batteries (LIBs), as one of the most promising power sources, have successfully revolutionized communications and the transportation style of our modern life, driving mobile phones/laptops, and more recently electric vehicles [3, 4]. However, the state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries using graphite anodes with a low theoretical specific capacity of 372 mAh g 1 have almost reached their theoretical specific energy density ( 350 Wh kg 1), which still cannot satisfy the fast-growing requirement of the higher-energy-density batteries for wide applications, particularly long-lasting electric vehicles.\nTo address the low capacity issue of an aforementioned graphite anode, researchers around the world have been conducting extensive research on exploring alternative anodes for LIBs, such as silicon [5–8], oxides [9–14], sulfides [15–17], etc. Unfortunately, many issues existing in those reported anodes are as follows: (a) excess volume change during battery cycling, (b) high working voltage plateau, and (c) complicated material synthesis steps and high cost, which cause low practical energy density of Li-ion batteries based on above anodes. Besides, Li metal has been highly considered as one of most ideal anode candidates due to its ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g 1), lowest negative electrochemical potential ( 3.040 V versus standard hydrogen electrode), and lightweight (0.534 g cm 3) [18, 19]. In particular, Li metal batteries (LMBs) have recently become one of the most promising alternatives for future high-energy battery technologies when further development of low-capacity LIBs used currently has been in dilemma. The combination of high-capacity oxygen (O2) or sulfur\n148 B. Liu and H. Pan\n(S) cathode with the Li metal anode attracted intensive interest from the worldwide research community due to their high theoretical energy compared with the traditional LIBs, e.g., 3505 Wh kg 1 for Li-O2 and 2600 Wh kg\n1 for Li-S batteries. Further, Fig. 4.1 represents a clear comparison of specific energy densities among different battery systems including Li-air battery, Li-S battery, zinc (Zn)-air battery, advanced Li-ion battery, the existing Li-ion battery, and nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery [20]. Although the estimation of practical energy densities of energy storage devices is complicated, the specific energy values of different battery chemistries clearly map the development perspective of high-energy-density batteries in the future.\nBack to the development history of LMBs, the non-rechargeable lithium metal battery (LMBs) was first applied in digital watches, calculators, and medical devices by Exxon in the 1970s [21]. However, such a primary lithium-metal battery inevitably resulted in high cost and environmental pollution. To solve these issues, Moli Energy developed the first commercial rechargeable lithium metal battery (LMBs) through using molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) cathode and excess Li anode in the later 1980s, but it presented a serious safety risk because of the short circuit induced by lithium dendrite growth, thermal runaway, and potential explosion hazards. Thus all of the lithium-metal packs were recalled in 1989. Nippon Denki Kabushiki Gaisha (NEC) and Tadiran (a merge of Tadi Batteries and Ran, today controlled by Saft\n4 Rechargeable Lithium Metal Batteries 149\nGroupe SA) tried to improve the battery design later but with limited success, whereas very few companies are able to realize rechargeable LMBs. Herein, safety concerns hindered the opportunity of the further commercialization of LMBs at that time. Over the last 40 years, LMBs have been extensively investigated to eliminate safety concern of LMBs.\nIn this chapter, we first present an overview of Li-metal batteries, and then summarize issues/challenges and recently proposed strategies to develop Li metal anodes and promising cathodes in LMBs. Finally, a general summary and some perspectives for Li metal battery chemistry will be provided. We aim to provide a schematic of the fundamentals of lithium metal battery (LMBs), illustrate key progress in LMBs, and give an inspiration for future developments of nextgeneration Li-metal battery technology."

      "text" : "Lithium is the lightest one in the alkali metal group and has the smallest atomic radius of all metals. These characteristics enable Li metal with ultrahigh specific capacity and quick Li+ ion transfer. Li metal anode with an extremely high capacity of 3860 mAh g 1 has the most negative potential of all the currently known electrode materials, which enables high discharge voltage and high-energy density in LMBs. However, there are two main barriers facing LMBs. One is the growth of Li dendrites during repeated plating/stripping processes, and the other is low Coulombic efficiency (CE) of these processes. These two critical issues for Li metal anode cause the safety hazard: internal short circuits led by dendrites and limited cycle life of the batteries due to irreversible and continuous reactions between Li and electrolytes that generate thick solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers on the Li metal surface, consume Li and electrolyte, as well as increase the internal resistance. Thus it’s extremely necessary to clearly understand and consider Li dendrites and related issues."

      "text" : "Lithium metal can be plated and stripped repeatedly during the charge/discharge processes of LMBs. During Li deposition, i.e., charge process of LMBs, the initial nucleation sites on Li metal surface will be a dominant factor for governing subsequent Li deposition. Li metal thermodynamically easily grows dendritic morphology during such a Li deposition process. In contrast, some multivalent ion metal such as magnesium (Mg) tends to be dendrite-free with two (2D) – and three-dimensional (3D) morphology rather than one-dimensional (1D) dendritic morphology. This is because that Mg has a higher free energy difference between high-dimensional and low-dimensional phases than Li [3, 22, 23]. In addition, the surface diffusion of the Mg2+ ion on Mg anode surface is obviously faster than\n150 B. Liu and H. Pan\nthat on Li or Na surface, which makes Mg metal deposit toward the surrounding sites instead of on some lumped area to grow undesirable dendrites. Overall, in terms of thermodynamic view, both lower surface energy and higher migration energy of Li metal primarily contribute to dendrite formation during Li metal deposition.\nDuring the initial stage of Li-ion plating process, the nucleation models can be mainly classified as follows: (1) heterogeneous nucleation model [24, 25], (2) space-charge model [26], and (3) SEI-induced nucleation model [27]. Li nucleation occurrence on the alien current collectors is identified as a heterogeneous nucleation behavior. As demonstrated by Cui’s group, such a heterogeneous nucleation is demonstrated by the selective deposition of Li on the gold (Au) substrates rather than copper (Cu, Fig. 4.2) [25]. In addition, Chazalviel reported a space-charge model for Li dendrite nucleation [26]. Briefly, during Li-ion deposition at high rates, the concentration of anions in dilute electrolyte decreases near the electrode surface, which leads to the establishment of a very large space charge an electric field near the electrolyte/electrode interface. This facilitates a subsequent ramified growth of Li [26]. Furthermore, Li metal is thermodynamically unstable with an organic solvent; thus both can react to form solid-electrolyte interphase on Li metal anode [28]. This SEI layer will continuously break down and re-form during Li deposition/stripping processes, further promoting dendritic Li growth. However, most models in the reported literature do not focus on the effect of the SEI on the Li dendrite growth mechanisms. So, this can be classified as an SEI-induced nucleating model. The Sacci’s group revealed direct visualization of SEI formation during lithium deposition using in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [27]. It can be seen that the dark dashed curve indicates the gradual formation of SEI, prior to Li deposition process, as shown in Fig. 4.3. Nevertheless, the actual formation sequence of SEI formation and Li deposition process would be immediately varied by changing electrolytes in a practical condition.\n4 Rechargeable Lithium Metal Batteries 151"

      "text" : "After nucleation of initial-stage Li dendrite growth, Li continues to grow into large deposits. Li dendrite growth is mainly determined by the electronic field, the electrolyte concentration, and properties of SEI films [29, 30]. According to previously reported results, morphologies of Li dendrites mainly contain needlelike, mosslike, treelike structures [31–33]. Needlelike one-dimensional dendrites without numerous branches hold the most threat to cause the short circuit in LMBs. So far, extensive efforts have been made to characterize and analyze the formation and growth steps of Li dendrites by using different characterization methods, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), optical microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) [34–39]. For example, Mehdi et al. directly observed real-time SEI formation and Li dendrite growth evolution at Li anode/ electrolyte interface during the first three charge-discharge cycles (Fig. 4.4) [40].\nAlso, some inactive “dead” Li residues detach from the platinum (Pt) electrode after Li stripping process, and it’s one of the main reasons for the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) in rechargeable LMBs. In recent work [41], an operando observation of the Li electrode surface were time-synchronized with the corresponding potential traces of the designed cell in 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate solution (LiPF6) in ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate (EC, C3H4O3/DMC, (CH3O)2CO) electrolyte in the first three half-cycles from an even larger electrode area scale (Fig. 4.5). The formation/dissolution of new lithium was entangled with the formation of “dead” lithium during repeated cycles across the whole electrode surface. This causes a continuous displacing of “dead” lithium in the electrode and the consequent uncontrollable growth of Li upon cycling.\nSome considerable external influences (i.e., current density, pressure, and temperature) on the Li dendrite growth behaviors have been investigated as well. An early work has revealed the influence of the current density and Li plating capacity on the dendrite formation on Li electrode [42]. It has been found that the total amount of discharge capacity enabling no dendrite formation increases with increasing current density up to 1 mA cm 2 and then decreases with further increasing current density, less than 2 mA cm 2 (Fig. 4.6). An optimal condition of a current rate of 1 mA cm 2 with a total amount of discharge of 12 C cm 2 for Li metal deposition was found to prevent the heterogeneous Li dendrite growth. In addition, the external pressure applied on lithium metal battery (LMBs) will have an immediate and partial suppression of Li dendrite growth occurred on Li metal anode.

This critical role of pressure particularly in lithium metal battery (LMB) should arouse more attention. Li-ion diffusion, electrolyte viscosity, and reaction kinetics on Li metal are associated with temperature. Akolkar reported modeling dendrite growth during lithium electrodeposition at a sub-ambient temperature, giving a good guideline to define the lowest temperature for safe operation of Li-metal batteries [44]. A key temperature region required to suppress dendrite formation under different current densities were suggested in Fig. 4.7. The red curve indicates a critical temperature. Below the critical temperature, uncontrolled dendrite growth was initiated, while the blue one shows a much lower dendrite growth rate ratio. The region above the blue curve can be identified as the region for suppression of dendrite growth and stable operation of batteries."

Those reactions are generally hard to control, which continuously consumes both electrolyte and Li metal, leading to low Coulombic efficiency (CE) during LMBs.

Effective methods are required to minimize the side reactions between the electrolyte and Li metal to address the above issue.\n156 B. Liu and H. Pan"

      "heading" : "4.2.2.1 Evaluation of CE of Lithium Plating/Stripping",
      "text" : "In most literature, different calculation methods of CE often result in different values of CE. In addition, CE is dependent on cycling conditions (i.e., current density, temperature, cycling time, and aging). Thus, the value of the CE for a given electrolyte could be misleading and not comparable if the calculation of CE is not associated with detailed testing conditions [28]. Here, four kinds of evaluation methods of CE for Li plating/stripping processes are listed below:\nMethod 1: CE of Li is calculated through:\nCE ¼ QS QD\n(4:1)\nwhere QS and QD are charged for Li stripping and plating determined for each cycle. This method is first defined by Aurbach in 1999 [45], which is applicable when Li is deposited on the inert electrode surfaces, such as nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), and tungsten (W).\nMethod 2: CE of Li metal is calculated through [46]\nCE ¼ nQC nQC þ QD\n(4:2)\nwhere n denotes the total deposition/stripping times, QD is for originally known amount of deposition charge for Li metal on the working electrodes (Ni or Cu), QD is usually determined by the thickness and density of Li metal electrode, and QC is a fraction of charge cycled across the cell in order to advance lithium striping-deposition cycles. The stripping overpotential is monitored upon cycling. Above process will be completed once the anodic overpotential reaches more than 100 mV.\nMethod 3: Moreover, some literature also used a figure-of-merit (FOM) value rather than CE. For example [47],\nFOMLi ¼ nQDQT ¼ 1 1 CE (4:3)\nwhere nQD is the total accumulated cell capacity, while QT is the theoretical Li capacity or Li turnover number.\nMethod 4: Besides the above methods, Zhang’s group developed more reliable methods for measuring CE to precisely quantify the amount of Li consumed during cycling and estimate the cycle life of LMBs [48]. In this method, a given amount of charge (QT) is used to deposit Li on the copper (Cu) as a Li reservoir,\n4 Rechargeable Lithium Metal Batteries 157\nthen a smaller portion of the charge (QC) is used to cycle Li for n cycles (Fig. 4.8). After n cycles, a final exhaustive stripping process, corresponding to the stripping charge (QS), is conducted to completely remove all of Li residues on Cu. So, the average CE (CEavg) can be calculated below:\nCEavg ¼ nQC þ QSnQC þ QT (4:4)\nThe advantage of this method is to minimize the effects of Cu current collector because Li plating/stripping occurs on Li metal substrate rather than the external substrate in a practical LMB [48]."

The passivation effect from SEI facilitates the cell operation in a reductive environment at a voltage window of more than 4 V. Different from the well-known graphite anode in current LIBs, Li anode has more restrictive requirements on the SEI properties to be rechargeable. The composition, morphology, ionic conductivity, flexibility, and elasticity are strongly related to Li plating behavior and CE of Li metal. In practice, the formation of SEI on Li metal surface is originated from the intrinsic reaction between electrolyte and Li metal. A broad range of factors from various electrolyte solvents and salts and their concentrations, etc. will dramatically change the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)/highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), ion diffusion, and viscosity of electrolytes. The SEI formed on Li metal is therefore tailored by thermodynamic and kinetics of reactions between electrolyte and Li metal. Ideally, the SEI should possess the following features: (1) high ionic conductivity to minimize the diffusion resistance of Li+ through this SEI film, (2) dense layer with appropriate thickness to prevent continuous direct contact between electrolyte and Li metal, (3) strong mechanical and elastic function to greatly accommodate the volume and morphological change of Li metal during cycles, and (4) excellent stability in terms of chemistry/electrochemistry in the long-lasting cycles.\nInfluence of Electrolyte Solvent Organic carbonate-based electrolytes, widely used in today’s commercial LIBs, are currently applied for the LMBs. The SEI composition from carbonate electrolytes is mainly Li alkyl carbonates [ROCO2Li] produced from one-electron reduction of alkyl carbonates [39], and composition of inorganic components (lithium oxide [Li2O], lithium carbonate [CLi2O3], as well as Li halides [LiI]) [51]. Unfortunately, the SEI film generated from traditional carbonate electrolyte usually has poor flexibility to stably accommodate repeated Li plating and stripping [52]. Compared to carbonate solvents, ethers generally presented higher stability against Li metal anode for both CE and suppressed dendrite growth [53], which could be attributed to the strong binding affinity to Li surfaces and good flexibility of as-formed oligomers in ether-based electrolytes. However, common ethers have low anodic decomposition voltage (<4 V vs Li+/Li) and high flammability [53].\nInfluence of Electrolyte Salt Selection of electrolyte salts also plays an important role in the SEI formation, further affecting CE of Li metal that is strongly dependent on the nature of SEI. Kanamura et al. studied the effect of different electrolyte salts (lithium hexafluoroarsenate [LiAsF6], lithium hexafluorophosphate [LiPF6], lithium perchlorate [LiClO4], or lithium tetrafluoroborate [LiBF4]) on SEI on Li electrode [54, 55]. The SEI composition and resistance can be accordingly adjusted by using different salts and thus influence the CE of Li metal. Ding et al. gave an evident difference for the CE of Li electrodes with different electrolyte salts as follows: lithium hexafluoroarsenate (95% [LiAsF6]) > lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB, 93% [LiB (C2O4)2]) > lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB, 86% [LiBF2(C2O4)] >\n4 Rechargeable Lithium Metal Batteries 159\nlithium hexafluorophosphate (77% [LiPF6]) > lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (73% [LiCF3SO3]) > lithium perchlorate (72% [LiClO4]) lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI, 72% [CF3SO2NLiSO2CF3]) ~ lithium tetrafluoroborate (72% [LiBF4]) > lithium iodide (69% [LiI])} [56]."

      "heading" : "4.2.3.1 Electrolyte Engineering",
      "text" : "Electrolyte stability has been regarded as a most important element for any battery systems, not only limited to LMBs. Basically, the anions of the Li salts and the solvent molecules can decompose to produce SEI films on Li metal surface either during the initial contact between electrolyte and Li or through the subsequent electrochemical processes [51, 56–58]. Herein, electrolyte engineering toward a stable interface between Li and electrolyte was proven to be one fundamental approach to stabilize Li metal anode.\nLiquid Electrolyte Additives Researchers have demonstrated that the use of the efficient additives in the electrolytes can suppress the Li dendrite growth. In a typical 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate [LiPF6]/ethylene carbonate (EC, [C3H4O3])-ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC, [C4H8O3]) electrolyte, the deposited Li on copper (Cu) substrate generally grows in a random way to form needlelike and mosslike morphologies (also called “dendrites”) [59]. Qian et al. found that the addition of a trace amount of water (50 ppm) to 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6)/propylene carbonate (PC, [C4H6O3]) can help the formation of dendrite-free compact and dense Li-deposited film composed of well-aligned nanorods (Fig. 4.9a) [58]. A trace amount of hydrogen fluoride [HF] originated from the decomposition reaction of LiPF6 with water [H2O] can be reduced during the initial Li deposition process by forming a dense and uniform lithium fluoride [LiF]-rich SEI layer on the substrate. The uniform SEI layer led to a uniform distribution of the electric field, enabling subsequent dendrite-free Li deposition. 0.05 M cesium hexafluorophosphate [CsPF6] has also been reported as an effective addition in 1 M LiPF6-PC electrolyte, leading to a highly compact and very smooth Li deposited layer on Cu substrate (Fig. 4.9b) [60, 61]. Cesium ion (Cs+) has been proposed to play a critical role in generating a self-healing electrostatic shield effect on Li metal surface. With electrostatic shielding of Cs+, the Li tends to deposit on the adjacent regions of initial Li growth tips and thus eliminates the Li dendrite growth. In addition, the LiPF6 was\n160 B. Liu and H. Pan\nalso reported as an effective additive in the LiTFSI [CF3SO2NLiSO2CF3]-LiBOB [LiB(C2O4)2]/EC [C3H4O3]-EMC [C4H8O3] dual-salt electrolyte, which promotes the formation of more compact wiry Li deposits with conductive SEI layer on Li surface (Fig. 4.9c) [59]. The LiPF6 additive can facilitate the polymerization of EC solvent molecules to produce polycarbonates on the Li surface and protect cathode and Al current collector. Though the aforementioned additives have been proven to be effective to suppress Li dendrite, some additives (i.e., H2O and CsPF6) are not able to improve CE of Li anodes much. Recent work presented the use of mixed additives of 2% LiAsF6 and 2% vinylene carbonate (VC, [C3H2O3]) or fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC, [C3H3FO3]) is beneficial for both formation of well-aligned nanorod Li deposits and the increase of Li CE from 73.2% to 96.5% [62]. The increase in CE was due to the electrochemical reduction of LiAsF6 additive, i.e., lithium fluoride [LiF] and lithium arsenate [LixAs], which passivates copper (Cu) substrate and serves for nanoseeds for aligned Li growth. Meanwhile, the polymerization products of vinylene carbonate (VC) or fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) protects Li metal and promotes the cycling stability of LMBs.\nConcentrated Liquid Electrolyte Jeong et al. pioneered the study in high concentration propylene carbonate (PC, [C4H6O3]) electrolytes to suppress Li dendrite deposition in 2008 [63]. After that, different kinds of high concentrated electrolytes (HCE) have been confirmed to be effective to the protection of Li metal and suppression of Li dendrite growth. For examples, 7 M bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, [CF3SO2NLiSO2CF3]) in 1,3-dioxolane (DOL, [C3H6O2]) and dimethyl ether (DME, [(CH3)2O]) [64], 4.9 mol kg\n1 lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI, [F2LiNO4S2]) in fluorosulfonylimide (FSI)-based ionic liquids [65], 4.2 M lithium\nbis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (LiTFSA, [(CH3)3Si]2NLi]) in acetonitrile (AN, [CH3CN]) [66], 4 M LiFSI in DME [67], 4 M lithium nitrate [LiNO3] in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, [CH3)2SO]) [68], 3 M LiTFSI in DME [69], and LiTFSI in 3 M DMSO electrolytes [70] have been reported (Fig. 4.10). According to calculation analysis in those works, the excess free solvents in dilute electrolytes react easily and directly with Li metal anodes, thus leading to continuous corrosion of Li metal. But highly concentrated electrolytes with optimal salt-solvent coordination are able to enhance the stability of electrolyte upon cycling. In an ideal concentrated electrolyte, all solvents and anions coordinate to Li ions to create a fluid polymeric network of Li+ cations and anions to suppress potential parasitic reactions.\nAlthough high concentration electrolytes have already demonstrated attractive features, such as high reductive/oxidative/thermal stability, high carrier density, fast electrode reaction, and low volatility, the greatly increased cost from the high concentration of salt has become a big concern for the high concentration electrolytes. Recently, Zhang’s group reported a new concept of localized high concentration electrolyte (LHCE) by adding inert diluent into an high concentrated electrolyte (HCE) [71]. Briefly, the selected diluent solvent does not solvate salt but is miscible with solvent as well as Li+-solvent solvates in the highly concentrated electrolytes (HCE). Consequently, the LHCE lowers the overall concentration of salt but retains a similar local coordination environment of salt and solvent to those in the HCE. For example, an LHCE of 1.2 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI, [F2NO4S2Li]) in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME, [CH3OCH2CH2OCH3]) – bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl ether (BTFE, [CF3CH2)2O]) (1:2 by mol/mol) was reported by mixing an HCE of 5.5 M LiFSI-DMC electrolyte and diluent BTFE. Figure 4.11 shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of Lideposited layers on Cu at a current density of 1.0 mA cm 2 with HCE (Fig. 4.11a, b)\n162 B. Liu and H. Pan\nand LHCE of 1.2 M LiFSI/DMC-BTFE (Fig. 4.11c, d). Clearly, the thickness of Li deposition from HCE of 5.5 M LiFSI/DMC is higher than that from LHCE of 1.2 M LiFSI/DMC-BTFE under a same Li deposition amount. The development of LHCE could be a more practical approach to stabilize the interfacial reactions on Li metal in LMB systems and other battery systems [72–74].\nSolid-State Electrolyte In contrast to liquid organic electrolytes, solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have been considered as a final solution for the safety issues in the battery system, such as flammability, poor chemical stability, leakage, etc. The low ionic conductivity had been one significant limitation of SSEs before. In the recent years, it has been\nimproved a lot. The oxygen-based SSEs (i.e., lithium super ionic conductor, LiSICON) and garnet SSEs show ionic conductivities of about 10 3 S cm 2 and 10 4 S cm 1, respectively [18, 75–77]. Sulfide-based SSEs has reached a comparable value of that in a liquid electrolyte (10 2 S cm 1 at room temperature) [78]. The use of high-modulus SSEs in LMBs replacing liquid electrolytes has been found to suppress Li dendrite growth [19].\nBesides the ionic conductivity issue of SSE, there are still grand challenges in the applications of SSEs in LMBs: (a) poor interfacial stability against Li metal anodes, especially for the sulfide SSEs, (b) large interfacial resistance between the SSE and Li metal, and (c) poor stability in the atmospheric environment. For example, interfacial side-reaction species can be detected on the interface between Li and SSE after simple physical contact [79]. Further, a clear comparison of electrochemical stability window among different SSE materials has been well summarized by Ceder’s group on basis of the thermodynamics of formation of resistive interfacial phases between solid-state electrolyte and electrodes (Fig. 4.12) [80]. The effective electrochemical window of certain SSEs can be extended after reacting with electrode materials by forming barrier layers. In order to improve the interfacial contact, atomic layer deposition (ALD) coating layer on the SSEs surface represented the positive effect to improve wetting of EES surface and minimize the interfacial resistance on Li metal surface [81]. Meanwhile, the interfacial problems in the cathode are as important as that in the anode part; however, very few attentions were paid to such area so far. Overall, there is still a long way to improve the interfacial properties before applying SSEs in a practical LMB."

      "text" : "The volume change of electrode materials during the charge and discharge process is commonly observed, and it plays an important role in affecting the lifetime for various kinds of battery systems. For example, a relatively low volumetric expansion rate such as ~10% in graphite anode can be accommodated by porous electrode itself (Fig. 4.13a), while up to 300% volume expansion in silicon anode has become a critical concern for its cycle life due to the increasing challenges of SEI layer stability (Fig. 4.13b) [82, 83]. Despite those challenges, the modifications of electrode architecture and electrolyte additive have been proven to be on the right way to solve volume expansion problems in recent years [82, 84]. In contrast to the conventional electrode materials, the Li metal anode suffers virtually infinite volume change during plating and stripping process due to the “hostless” nature of Li metal anode (Fig. 4.13c). In addition, the huge volumetric expansion causes repeated breaking and re-forming of the SEI layer on the lithium metal surface and speeds up the degradation of Li metal anode and depletion of electrolyte during cycling [85, 86]. Very recently, the critical issue of volumetric change has been tackled by introducing a stable host material for Li metal [87]. Such approaches exhibit significant\n164 B. Liu and H. Pan\nadvantages in stabilizing Li metal during cycling for practical application of Li metal as the high-capacity anode. First, the host materials reserve space for Li metal deposition and reduce the overall volumetric change. Second, the host materials have higher surface area than planer Li metal, which dramatically reduces the effective local current density and increases the availability of more Li nuclei sites to guide a uniform and dendrite-proof Li deposition morphology.\nElectronically Conductive Carbonaceous Host Carbon-based materials have high conductivity and lightweight and they can be made with different shapes and structures, which make them very suitable host candidates for Li metal deposition. Yi and co-workers first reported a lithium-scaffold composite electrode fabricated by lithium melt infusion into a three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon fiber matrix (Fig. 4.14a) [88]. The composite electrode showed stable cycling with a small overpotential of 90 mVat a large current density of 3 mA cm 2 during Li plating/striping over 80 cycles. The wettability of Li metal (or lipophilicity) was also found to be of great importance for the spontaneous Li infusion into the carbon host since most carbon materials can hardly wet the molten Li metal. With a thin silicon (Si) coating layer by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method on the carbon fiber scaffold surface, the carbon matrix changed from “lithiophobicity” to “lipophilicity” by increasing the bonding interaction between the carbon host surface and molten Li, such as forming a binary Li-Si alloy interfacial phase [88]. Other compounds, such as zinc\noxide (ZnO), that show strong chemical adsorption and reactions with Li metal may also be good candidates as a coating layer onto carbon host [92, 93].\nBesides surface coating, surface functional groups that show strong affinity to Li metal may also help. Layered sparked reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) was found to possess excellent Li wettability due to the multifunctional hydrophilic groups on the surface of r-GOs (Fig. 4.14b). The Li-rGOs composite anode showed ~89% of the theoretical capacity of Li metal (3390mAh g composite Li 1 anode vs 3800mAh gLi 1) and significant reduction in the volume change to below 20%, thus resulting in significant improvement\nin cycling, reduction in polarization, and dendrite-free properties [89]. Other types of functional carbon materials such as 3D carbon nanotubes (CNT) [94], 3D fluorine-doped graphene [95], and cellular graphene scaffold [96] have been reported to show similar improvement in suppressing the volume change and dendrite growth during cycling.\nThe 3D Metal Current Collector Host The 3D metal current collector has much more electroactive surface area than the planar Li metal anode, which could be directly used as a conducting host for Li deposition. Submicron-sized copper (Cu) skeleton synthesized by reduction of copper (II) hydroxide [Cu(OH)2] fibers on Cu foil was proven to accommodate Li metal and show completely different plating behavior of Li metal [90]. On a planar Cu foil, the Li prefers to initially form small Li islands at the early stage of nucleation process. Then, Li metal tends to deposit on the sharp tips of the previously formed small Li due to the higher local Li+ ion concentration induced by a stronger electric field at those tips, which further amplifies Li dendrite growth. In contrast, the submicron skeleton of 3D Cu with numerous protuberant tips on the Cu fiber provides more homogenous electric field distribution and produces uniform Li deposition within the 3D Cu current collector (Fig. 4.14c). Lithium gradually fills the pores of 3D Cu along with the increasing of Li amount on the 3D host and eventually forms an even surface. The filled Li can be completely stripped after charging to 0.5 V. The 3D Cu skeleton and dendrite-free feature remain unchanged after repeated cycles [90], indicating high reliable stability of 3D Cu skeleton to inhibit dendrite formation. Other 3D metal current collectors, such as 3D nickel (Ni) foam [97], cobalt(II) oxide [CoO] decorated Ni foam [98], 3D Cu-Ni core-shell wire [99], etc., also exhibited improved cycling of Li embedded in the 3D current collector network. Nevertheless, the maximum amount of Li without dendrite formation that can be put into the 3D current collector needs to be carefully considered in the future since the heavy and inactive metal current collector significantly reduces the achievable energy density of composite Li anode for practical application. In addition, the potential risk of piercing of 3D metal current collector through the separator during practical cell assembling also needs to be considered."

      "text" : "The solid-state electrolyte presents higher interfacial stability toward Li metal compared with the liquid electrolyte due to limited reactivity between Li metal and solid-state electrolyte [100, 101]. Recently, solid-state electrolytes have been considered as a fundamental strategy to eliminate all the issues of Li metal such as dendrite growth and low coulombic efficiency for the ultimate application of Li metal batteries [102, 103]. A 3D Li+ ion-conductive framework made of an ionic conductor can serve as a good candidate for the Li metal battery because it not only provides the stable host with stable interface against Li metal but also allows fast Li+ ion transport through the host. Nevertheless, the solid electrolyte is usually hard to be processed as a thin film or 3D porous framework in practice; therefore, 3D Li+ ion-conductive framework applied in Li metal is rarely reported in the literature. Very recently, Hu’s group demonstrated a solid-state composite Li metal anode\n168 B. Liu and H. Pan\nthrough integrating a 3D solid-state Li+ ion-conductive host with Cu current collector [91, 104]. The 3D ion-conductive framework was fabricated by using a lithium lanthanum calcium zirconium niobium oxide [Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12] garnet-type Li+ ion conductor with porous-dense-porous structure (Fig. 4.14d). As shown in Fig. 4.14d, the ion-conductive host consists of a dense layer as the separator and two porous layers for hosting cathode-active materials and Li metal anode. The 3D solid-state ion-conductive host shows a safe and dendrite-free behavior for Li metal during plating/stripping process. In addition, the Li starts to rise from the bottom near the Cu current collector during Li plating process and shows a reverse process during stripping, which further reduces the possibility of penetration of Li dendrite through the middle dense separator. The 3D ion-conductive host for Li metal can be cycled with good stability for 300 h at 1 mAh cm 2 at 0.5 mA cm 2 without failure of cell short or significant increase in overpotential.\nGuided Li Deposition in 3D Host A 3D host provides a favored choice to reduce the volume change of Li metal and improve its cyclability. However, it is of equal or more importance to guide the deposition of Li metal preferentially within the predesigned 3D host during repeated cycles, especially under the large cycled capacity of Li and at high current densities. It was found that Li deposition shows different overpotentials on different metallic substrates due to different nucleation barriers [25]. The commonly used Cu substrate for Li exhibits a substantial nucleation barrier because of negligible solubility of Li in Cu, whereas no barrier is shown for metals with a certain amount of Li solubility. A controlled Li nucleation and growth was demonstrated to effectively engineer the Li deposition process by a favored nuclei seed (such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), and zinc (Zn)) for Li metal [25, 105]. For example, the Au seeds located in the hollow carbon sphere facilitate the Li solely deposited inside the carbon shell and also act with a suitable host to accommodate Li metal and protect the Li metal from reacting with electrolytes (Fig. 4.15a) [25]. A much improved coulombic efficiency (>98%) was obtained over 300 cycles in an alkyl carbonate electrolyte for carbon sphere host with Au seeds, while a low coulombic efficiency of 90% with fast decay in 50 cycles was observed in a traditional Cu substrate. In addition, the Li deposition can also be guided by tuning the surface chemistry of host materials and 3D patterned substrates to direct Li deposition at specific positions with modified electric field distribution on the substrates (Fig. 4.15b) [106–108]."

      "text" : "The interface/interphase between Li metal and electrolyte is the place where the Li plating/striping occurs in an LMB. The stability of interface/interphase, typically the SEI layer, has the immediate impact on the behavior of Li plating/striping and safety of Li metal batteries. The interfacial stability for Li metal is actually much more critical than that in conventional LIB technologies due to the high reactivity of Li metal with various kinds of electrolytes. Additional suitable protection layer on Li metal could be helpful to block the continuous reaction between electrolyte and Li\n4 Rechargeable Lithium Metal Batteries 169\nmetal and provide a physical barrier layer to suppress Li dendrite growth and penetration. The interfacial protection layer can be either artificial or electrochemically formed layer on the Li metal surface, and this layer is highly expected to have the high mechanical strength and electrochemical stability upon cycling. In situformed SEI layers with tailored morphology, composition, and function largely depend on the formula of electrolytes, which have been discussed in Sect. 4.2.3.1 of this chapter. Herein, this section mainly focuses on the discussion of artificial protection layers on Li metal surface.\nSolid/Gel Electrolyte Layer An artificial solid/gel electrolyte interphase layer between Li metal and the liquid electrolyte can function as the effective protection layer for Li metal that can suppress Li corrosion and dendrite growth and provide fast Li+ ion transport through the interphase layer. For example, a uniform artificial ionic conductive SEI layer primarily composed of lithium phosphorous sulfur [Li3PS4] (space group Pnma) prepared by in situ reaction of polyphosphoric acid (PPA, Hn + 2PnO3n + 1) with Li metal layer has been found to be stable without a break/repair and short circuit during cycling of Li metal (Fig. 4.16a) [109]. Highly ionic conductive lithium nitride [Li3N] protective layer obtained by direct reaction between Li and nitrogen (N2) gas at room temperature was also demonstrated to suppress the nonuniform deposition of Li, improving the safety of the battery without sacrificing the migration of Li+ ions [113]. Besides the ionic conducting compounds, in situ-formed polymer electrolyte layers deprived of the polarization or cross-linking reaction of organic electrolyte\ningredients by the ultraviolet radiation-curing method were also effective in stabilizing Li metal [114, 115]. A combination of soft polymer electrolyte with inorganic ceramic particles can further improve the mechanical strength of artificial solid electrolyte layer to suppress Li dendrite piercing through the separator. For example, a composite layer of poly(vinylidene fluoride (PVdF)-hexafluoropropylene) (HFP) {(–CH2CF2–)x[–CF2CF(CF3)–]y}and aluminum oxide [Al2O3] particles demonstrated significantly improved elastic and shear modulus compared with the PVdFHFP polymer and delivered a stable cycling under a current density up to 10 mAh cm 2 [116].\nLayered Compound The 2D layered compounds have wide applications in the electronic device, catalysis, and energy storage areas due to unique electronic structures [117, 118]. Recently, 2D layered materials were also extended to their potential application in protecting Li metal anode with a function of artificially tailoring of the\ntop SEI layer properties and its Young’s modulus, while the Li+ ions can also freely pass through the layer in the vertical direction. For example, ultrathin 2D layered hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and graphene were used to cover onto the Cu current collector to form a 2D layer-Li-Cu sandwich structure, which effectively stabilized the interface of Li metal (Fig. 4.16b) and suppressed the growth of Li dendrites through the stiff B-N bond and chemical stability [110]. A 2D molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) layer with a thickness of ~10 nm by the sputtering method was reported to function as a protection layer for Li metal anodes and greatly improve cell performance in Li-S batteries by stabilization of the electrodeposition of Li metal and suppression of dendrite nucleation (Fig. 4.16c) [111]. A low-voltage hysteresis even at a high current density of 10 mA cm 2 was observed, which has been attributed to the strong adhesion of the lithiated MoS2 layer to Li and favorable Li transport through the layer (small energy barrier of 0.155 eV). A threshold improvement in cycle life was achieved compared with base Li metal, showing stable performance and low impedance upon cycling [111]. In addition, theoretical investigations on various 2D layered materials as a protection layer on Li metal have recently been carried out [112]. It has been found that the defect patterns, crystalline structure, bond length, and metal proximity effect play the key role on the protective effect of 2D layered materials in terms of ion diffusion and mechanical properties, which are based on the fundamental of the electronic interaction or redistribution inside the materials systems [112]. Although introducing defects and proximity effect may facilitate the Li+ ion diffusion through the layer, it will weaken the mechanical strength of the protective layer (Fig. 4.16d). Therefore, a trade-off between ion diffusion and protective effect should be considered for practical applications.\nLi-Rich Composite Alloy Film Lithium metal has a certain amount of solubility in various metals such as aluminum (Al), zinc (Zn), indium (In), bismuth (Bi), etc., which makes Li alloy achievable in practice [119]. The reactivity of Li metal can be potentially and fundamentally adjusted due to the modification of the electronic structure of Li by forming Li alloys. Meanwhile, using the alloy approach, the properties of the SEI layer on Li metal, i.e., composition, structure, and function, therefore, can be tuned correspondingly [120]. Li alloy can be made by direct reactions with the other metals or chemically/electrochemically lithiation method. For example, the LixM alloyprotection layer can be chemically bound onto the Li metal foil surface through the following in situ reactions of metal chlorides with Li [120]:\nxLiþMClx ! Mþ xLiCl M ¼ ln,Zn,Bi, and As,etcð Þ (4:5) The as-formed metal layer will immediately undergo reactions with the underlying Li metal, forming a single or multiphases of Li alloy (it depends on the phase diagram of Li-M alloy):\n172 B. Liu and H. Pan\nyLiþ zM ! LiyMz (4:6) In the cases of Li13ln13 and LiZn, the in situ-formed composite Li alloy protection layer showed smooth Li deposition under the alloy protection layer in Li13ln13jLi and LiZnjLi cell, where the insulating LiCl in the alloy composite layer prevents the reduction of Li+ ion on the top surface. The composite alloy layer retained its composition during cycling and demonstrated an extended cycling life of 1400 h in a symmetrical cell at 2 mA cm 2 [120]. In addition, a composite of LixM (M can be Si, tin (Sn), Al) alloy particles encapsulated by large graphene sheet further improved stability in different air conditions due to the completely covered LixM alloy clusters by graphene sheet. The LixM/graphene maintained a stable structure and improved cyclability over 400 cycles with 98% capacity retention in a half cell [121]. Moreover, the environmental stability of Li-containing anode toward the atmosphere, electrode materials, and electrolyte can be further improved by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of oxides or fluorides in the future."

      "text" : "Except for the direct approaches of the chemical and/or physical engineering of Li metal anode, some external parameters such as the pressure will also fundamentally change the electrochemical behavior of Li metal thermodynamically. The Gibbs free energy of Li metal electrode will be tailored by external force p through G(p, T) = U + pV–TS, where G is Gibbs free energy, (kJ/mol); U is the internal energy, (kJ/mol); p is the pressure, (atm); V is the volume, (L); T is the thermodynamic temperature, (K); and S is the system entropy, (JK 1). The pressure, therefore, affects the growth mode and morphology of Li metal during the Li plating/stripping process intrinsically. For example, it was recently found that the electrochemical deposition of Li metal can be affected by the external pressure [122]. Instead of highly porous Li deposition, a much more compact Li deposition was achieved under a pressure condition. The improved Li morphology under pressure leads to fivefold longer cycle life and 5% higher coulombic efficiency with the same electrolytes [122]. Though the external parameters are important to Li metal, this area is currently still almost blank. Experimental results combined with theoretical simulation of external pressure will be helpful to further understand the effect of pressure on the Li deposition behavior and improve safety for lithium metal battery (LMBs) in the future."

      "text" : "Li-air or Li-O2 battery has attracted worldwide interest over the last two decades due to their high theoretical specific energy (3505 Wh kg 1 for nonaqueous battery; 3582 Wh kg 1 for aqueous one) [124–128]. The first nonaqueous Li-O2 battery was proposed by Abraham and Jiang in 1996 [129]. Since then, the extensive worldwide efforts have already been devoted to building an ideal Li-O2 battery system to realize its practical application [130–138]. In general, a typical Li-O2 battery includes an air electrode composed of the porous gas diffusion layer and a catalyst/carbon conductive agent, a separator soaked with electrolyte, and a Li metal anode. During the discharge process, gaseous O2 first diffuses into the porous air electrode/electrolyte interface and then participates in an electrochemical reduction reaction (2Li+ + O2 + 2e\n! Li2O2, E0 = 2.96 V vs Li/Li+). Upon the subsequent charge process, as-formed Li2O2 as discharge products can be decomposed, and meanwhile, O2 is also released during an electrochemical oxidation (Li2O2 ! 2Li + 2e + O2) [139].\nAlthough a number of key considerable progress in Li-O2 battery have been made to overcome the barriers in the practical large-scale application of Li-O2 batteries, there are three main challenges in a rechargeable Li-O2 battery: (1) The reduced oxygen species generated during the discharge process or oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), especially the superoxide radical anion, are very reactive with electrolyte, oxygen cathode, and Li metal anode [140]; (2) a high overpotential is required for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charge process [141]; and (3) continuous accumulation of undecomposed Li2O2 and other side reaction products at the oxygen-cathode surface during cycling leads to increased battery impedance [142]. Above factors cause limited reversible capacity, poor cycle life, and low CE of Li-O2 batteries."

      "heading" : "4.3.1.1 Catalysts for Oxygen Cathode",
      "text" : "As the electrochemical reactions on the oxygen cathode of a Li-O2 battery is indeed a kind of catalytic electrochemical process, thus those catalysts decorated on the oxygen cathode largely determine battery performance [138]. Rechargeable Li-O2 batteries already benefited from many proposed catalysts, including noble metals, carbon materials, oxides, carbides, and polymers.\nNoble Metals and Alloys Some precious metals or alloys (e.g., platinum (Pt) [143, 144], gold (Au) [145], PtAu [146], silver (Ag) [147, 148], palladium (Pd) [149, 150], and iridium (Ir) [151]) have been proven to show exceptional catalytic capability during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes in Li-O2 batteries. Primary purpose to introduce noble metal catalysts to oxygen cathodes is to decrease overpotential upon cycling, especially the OER process. Shao-horn’s group\n174 B. Liu and H. Pan\npresented bifunctional PtAu alloy catalysts by combining Pt with good catalytic performance during OER and Au with good catalytic capability during ORR, which significantly decreased the overpotential in their Li-O 2 batteries and increased the round-trip efficiency [146]. Nevertheless, the high cost of those catalysts already hinders their future scale-up application in Li-O2 batteries.\nFunctional Carbon Materials Compared to the high cost of noble metals mentioned above, the carbonaceous material should be one of the most inexpensive alternatives. Importantly, different carbon materials provide unique features: low cost, wettability, large surface area, high electrical conductivity, and good stability under harsh environments [138]. Basically, porous carbon is the critical component for architecture design of gas diffusion layer in Li-O2 batteries. Meanwhile, carbon can serve as both a substrate/conductive agent and a catalytic material [133]. Carbon materials with some defects or dopants can improve oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics in Li-O2 batteries [152–157]. For example, it was reported that the Li-O2 battery based on only functionalized graphene sheets with high-density reactive sites for Li-O2 reaction and microporous channels for oxygen gas diffusion delivered an ultrahigh capacity of 15,000 mAh g 1 [153]. However, later subsequent research indicated that bare carbon catalyst without any protection (e.g., from catalyst’s or other artificial films’ protection) will suffer severe corrosion and oxidation by the attack from reduced oxygen species (especially superoxide radical anion). In addition, carbon materials have limited catalytic effect for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) completely removing Li2O2 during charge process of Li-O2 batteries, resulting in increased charge overpotential and poor cycle life. To address these challenges, Liu et al. recently proposed a new concept of the one-step in situ pre-charging process to simultaneously promote thin protective films on carbon nanotubes oxygen-cathode and Li metal anode in an inert atmosphere prior to the Li-O2 battery cycling process (Fig. 4.17a) [158]. The pretreatment was conducted in inert atmosphere from the open-circuit voltage (OCV) to 4 .3V at 0.1 mA cm 2 and then holding the cells at 4.3 V for 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min, respectively. After the above optimal pre-treatment, Li-O2 batteries demonstrated significantly extended cycle life of 110 cycles under the capacity-limited protocol of 1000 mAh g 1 (limited cycles of 43 times for untreated cell) in Fig. 4.17b. This is because the protective films induced by the decomposition of a small amount electrolyte can significantly mitigate the oxidation of CNT air electrodes and suppress corrosion of Li metal anode upon cycling.\nCarbides As aforementioned, carbon-based oxygen cathodes still have stability issue such as decomposition caused by attaching from oxygen species and promoting electrolyte decomposition upon cycling [126, 159]. Non-carbon material as a catalyst in oxygen cathodes becomes an alternative to improve the stability of air electrodes during cycling. The non-carbon catalysts themselves should present some required features, such as sufficient electronic conductivity, low density, low cost, and chemical and\n4 Rechargeable Lithium Metal Batteries 175\nelectrochemical stability [160]. Titanium carbide (TiC) is one example that has been reported as a non-carbon catalyst to indicate stable cycling performance in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, [(CH3)2SO])-based electrolyte. The improved cycle life relies on the high electronic conductivity and protective oxide surface layer of TiC catalyst [159]. TiC showed lower stability than carbon-based materials in tetraglyme (tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether [C10H22O5])-based electrolytes [161]. While boron carbide (B4C) is highly resistive against chemical attack, it serves as an electrode material for batteries and fuel cells [162, 163]. Recently, Zhang et al. reported that Li-O2 batteries using B4C catalyst-based oxygen electrode exhibited a good discharge/charge performance in the tetraglyme-based electrolyte for over 250 cycles under a capacity-limited protocol of 100 mAh g 1. This could be attributed to the catalytic capability of B4C, the absence of surface layer, and relatively consistent surface composition [160]. However, further improvement for deep discharge/charge of Li-O2 batteries still needs more investigation.\nMetal Oxides Metal oxides can also function as catalyst in Li-O2 batteries, such as cobalt(II,III) oxide [Co3O4] [164–166], nickel cobaltite [NiCo2O4] [124, 167], manganese (IV) oxide [MnO2] [168–170], manganese cobaltite [MnCo2O4] [171, 172], zinc cobaltite [ZnCo2O4] [125, 173], ruthenium(IV) oxide [RuO2] [174, 175], etc. The intrinsic advantages of oxide metal catalysts contain high abundance, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Metal oxides usually need to be mixed with conductive agents or prepared on conductive substrates due to the low electronic conductivity. Interestingly, metal oxides usually deliver an impressive catalytic performance with active sites located at the surface of the catalysts. In an early work by Bruce’s group in 2008, (alpha manganese(IV) oxide) α-MnO2 nanowire catalyst delivered high capacities for Li-O2 batteries and attracted intensive research interest [176]. Later on, more metal oxide candidates have been explored in the last few years, and their catalytic activities and cycling stability have been progressively improved. In a recent work [174], researchers tried to put a ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2) shell on the surface of core carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form RuO2/CNTs composite catalyst by using a common sol-gel method (Fig. 4.18a–d). The Li-O2 batteries based on such a composite catalyst showed lowered discharge and charge overpotential of 0.21 V and 0.51 V, respectively, compared to only CNTs-based Li-O2 batteries (Fig. 4.18e). No decay on the specific capacity of Li-O2 batteries was observed with RuO2/CNTs oxygen cathodes for more than 100 cycles at a cutoff capacity of 300 mAh g 1 (Fig. 4.18f)."

      "text" : "Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) As mentioned above, in a typical Li-O2 battery, Li ions in electrolytes diffuse to the surface of oxygen to react with it to first form LiO2 intermediates (Li\n+ + O2 + e ! LiO2), which can be gradually converted to Li2O2 through either\n4 Rechargeable Lithium Metal Batteries 177\ncontinued electrochemical process (LiO2 + Li + + e ! Li2O2) or chemical disproportionation process (2LiO2 ! Li2O2 + O2) [177]. Two different models of O2 reduction have been presented. One is an O2 reduction to form Li2O2 occurred on the electrode surface [178, 179], and another is a Li2O2 formation in electrolyte solution after O2 reduction [180, 181]. Bruce’s group pioneered to prove the importance of LiO2 solubility for oxygen reduction in different donor-number (DN) electrolyte solutions (Fig. 4.19) [182]. In high donor-number (DN) electrolyte solvents, O2 reduction at high potentials and low potentials belong to the solution pathway (blue) and the surface pathway (red), respectively. In low DN solvents, O2 reduction follows the surface pathway at all potentials (red). The solubility of LiO2 should be regarded as a dominant factor for the formation pathway of discharge products. In addition, the O2 reduction\npathway can also be affected by temperature in the nonaqueous Li-O2 batteries [177]. The lifetime of superoxide and solution pathway plays a dominant role during O2 reduction process in the temperature range of 20 C to 0 C. The electrochemical kinetics of O2 reduction and the surface pathway dominate discharge behavior in the temperature range of 0 C to 40 C (Fig. 4.20). In addition to traditional Li2O2 as primary discharge products, some other species (e.g., lithium oxide (LiO2) [151] and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) [161]) as primary reversible discharge products have been proposed, but more investigation is still needed.\nOxygen Evaluation Reaction (OER) The charging Li-O2 battery is the oxidation of previously formed lithium oxide [Li2O2] discharge products to release O2, so-called oxygen evaluation reaction (OER). A relatively high applied voltage (i.e., >4 V) is required to achieve the full oxidation of Li2O2 (Fig. 4.21) [183]. Therefore, to reduce charge overpotential, effective catalysts are highly desired in the OER process. The OER catalysts include the solid catalysts on the electrode surface and the soluble redox mediators in the electrolytes. In general, mediators should have high stability, high diffusion coefficient, fast charge transfer kinetics. These mediators can be oxidized at a potential slightly above the equilibrium potential of the Li2O2 formation. The oxidized mediators can freely diffuse near the oxygen cathode surface to participate in the oxidation of Li2O2 particles and remarkably reduce charge overpotential for the oxidation of Li2O2 consequently [20, 184–187]. Nevertheless, there are still three critical concerns for the use of redox mediators: (1) how to find an appropriate mediator with a good compatibility with Li-O2\nchemistry; (2) how much battery capacity is contributed by the reactions of redox mediator itself, rather than Li-O2 battery chemistry; and (3) how to efficiently suppress the mediator’s diffusion to Li anode surface and the consequent side reactions with Li metal."

The use of sulfur cathode in lithium metal battery (LMB) brings a high theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg 1 [188]. In addition, sulfur is extremely abundant in earth crust with wide distribution and a very low cost [189], which makes more sense for the sulfur as electrode materials than the currently used expensive transition metal oxides cathodes. In fact, sulfur has been widely explored as a cathode material combined with alkaline metal as the anode for the energy storage devices for more than 50 years. A high-temperature molten salt sodium sulfur [Na-S] battery was first developed by Ford in the late1960s [190]. Room temperature lithium-sulfur [Li-S] primary battery was patented by D. Herbert and J. Ulam in 1962 [191]. Earlier in the 1970s, due to the technical limits of nanoengineering, the sulfur was existed as the polysulfide solution (Li2Sx) in various polarized electrolytes, from dimethylformamide [HCON (CH3)2], tetrahydrofuran [C4H8O] and dimethyl sulfoxide [(CH3)2SO], to ensure the well-contacts of active species and the conductive matrix.

Peled’s group in the 1980s, introducing the linear and cyclone ether as the electrolyte solvent, which still states as the “standard” electrolyte nowadays [188, 192]."

      "text" : "The working mechanism of the Li-S battery involves a combination of the electrochemical reduction and chemical disproportion of the lithium polysulfide and represents typical two plateaus at 2.35 V and 2.1 V vs Li in the ether-based\nelectrolyte, respectively, with multi-reaction pathways (Fig. 4.22). Generally, the reaction of sulfur proposes a ring-structure cyclic-S8’s ring-open reduction to the lithium polysulfide and partially dissolves into the electrolyte at the high voltage plateau (reactions 1–3). With the further reduction, the long-chain polysulfide would split into the short-chain polysulfide or even Li2S at the low-voltage plateau and deposited out from the electrolyte (reactions 4–5) [194]. Activated trisulfur [S3\n* ] radicals can be generated during electrochemical cycling due to the disproportion reactions (reaction 3), which has been proposed to affect the chemical equilibrium of sulfur chemistry at the end of discharge state and drive the reverse process of charging [195, 196]. The reaction pathway of sulfur can be tuned by the physical and chemical environment for sulfur species in a certain condition. For example, the sulfur-encapsulated-microporous carbon cathode presents a slop discharge/charge behavior in carbonate electrolyte instead of the commonly seen two-plateau behavior in ether-based electrolyte [197]."

      "text" : "In a Li-S cell, there are two of the main fundamental challenges. First, the intermediate lithium polysulfide species has a high solubility in the electrolyte such as the ether-based electrolyte [194]. The dissolution of polysulfides causes active material loss and therefore fast capacity decay during cycling. The dissolved polysulfide may migrate into the Li metal side and get reduced by Li metal and then migrate to the cathode side again, causing the well-known “shuttle effect” and low coulombic efficiency (inset of Fig. 4.22). Ether-based electrolytes with lithium nitrate [LiNO3] additive have been reported to effectively restrict the “shuttle” of polysulfide and present good stability with sulfur, but it is still challenging due to the gradual consumption of LiNO3 during long cycling [198]. Second, sulfur and its discharge product Li2S are highly insulating material. The redistribution of sulfur species\n182 B. Liu and H. Pan\nduring cycling causes uncontrollable passivation and aggregation of insulating species on the sulfur cathode, thus leading to low sulfur utilization and shortened cycle life. Most of the critical issues in Li-S batteries are originated from the aforementioned two challenges and have been hindering their further practical application."

      "text" : "Phase I: Encapsulating Sulfur in Conducting Porous Host Materials In the past decades, most efforts in Li-S battery research field have been devoted to the designing of functional cathode architecture to capture polysulfides and promote sulfur reactions during charge/discharge process. The most investigated strategy is to encapsulate sulfur into the porous conducting host matrix. Nazar and co-workers pioneered the work of highly ordered nanostructured carbon-sulfur composite cathode by infusing melted sulfur into nanopores at 155 C (Fig. 4.23a) [199]. The conductive mesoporous carbon (CMK3) constrains sulfur within its mesopores and generates essential electronic contact with the insulating sulfur species. The nanostructure of carbon-sulfur composite cathode also provides access for Li+ ions to ingress/egress the carbon-sulfur composite cathode for the reactivity of sulfur and aids the traping of polysulfide by the adsorption properties of nanomaterials. A high capacity of 1320 mAh g 1 was obtained with the carbon-sulfur composite cathode in ether-based electrolytes [199]. Later on, various porous host materials for sulfur have been comprehensively investigated to confine sulfur within the pores and/or high surface area surface, such as mesoporous carbon [200], hollow carbon sphere (point group Ih) [201], graphene (monolayer conforms to point group P6/mmm) [202, 203], hollow carbon nanofibers (CNF) [204, 205], transition metal oxide yolk shells (Fig. 4.23b) [206] or particles [207], carbide compounds [208], and conductive microporous polymers (Fig. 4.23c) [209], etc. In addition, the optimization of cell configuration such as with a porous interlayer on the top of the porous sulfur cathode can help to further mitigate the polysulfide diffusion into electrolyte and function as a top current collector, leading to improved cyclic stability (Fig. 4.23d) [210].\nPhase II: Surface Chemistry Modification of Conducting Matrix In addition to the architecture of porous cathode structure, the chemical interaction between polysulfide and conducting framework is another important factor that determines the capability of capturing polysulfides within the sulfur cathode during long-term cycling of Li-S batteries. Tailored surface chemistry of the porous nanostructures has attracted increasing interest recently. For example, carbon nanofibers (CNF) with tin-doped indium oxide nanoparticles decorating the surface (indium tin oxide, ITO [In2O3/SnO2]-carbon hybrid) presented remarkable improvement in capacity and cycling stability compared with the bare carbon nanofiber electrodes (Fig. 4.24a) [211]. It was proposed that the ITO-carbon hybrid material shows a stronger binding ability to the soluble polysulfide and exhibits better spacial control of polysulfide deposition on the electrode surface than the bare carbon electrodes. The polar surface of ITO-carbon hybrid enhances the redox kinetics of polysulfides\n4 Rechargeable Lithium Metal Batteries 183\n3 nm a c\nb d\n6. 5\nnm\nS m\nel t\nS x\nta l\nS ul\nph ur\nS ul\nph ur\nS ul\nph ur\nP ar\ntia l S\nP ol\nym er\nIn -s itu vu lc an\niz at\nio n\nP ol\nym er\n+ S\nul fu\nr\nLi a\nno de\nse pa\nra to\nr\nin te\nrla ye\nr\nS c\nat ho\nde\nP ol\nym er\n+ L\nith iu m S ul fid e\nC ha\nrg e\nD is\nch ar\nge\nS S H N H N H N\nH N H N N H N H\nS y S N H\nS S\nS S\nS S\n1- y\nS SS\nS S S\nSS S S S S\nS S\nS S\nS S\nS S\nS S\ndi ss\nol ut\nio n\nT iO\n2\nT iO\n2 T\niO 2\nco at\nin g\n±L i x\nFi g .4\n.2 3\n(a ) T he\nsc he m at ic of\nth e su lf ur\n(y el lo w ) co nfi\nne d in\nth e in te rc on\nne ct ed\nst ru ct ur e of\nm es op\nor ou\ns ca rb on\n,C M K -3\nby im\npr eg na tio\nn of\nm ol te n su lf ur ,\nan d th e su bs eq ue nt\ndi sc ha rg ech ar ge\npr oc es s w ith\nL i.

Liu and H. Pan\nand mediates the reduction of polysulfides to form solid Li2Sx on the electrode and therefore improves sulfur utilization (Fig. 4.24b, c) [211]. In addition, other type of transition metal oxides, sulfides, and carbides, such as titanium oxide [Ti4O7] [209], titanium sulfide [TiS2] [212], and titanium carbide [Ti2C] [213], also exhibited improved performance of sulfur cathode because of the strong interaction of the polysulfide species with the surface of transition metal atoms. While some work further indicated that only transition metal-based compounds with a redox potential in a certain targeted voltage window (2.4 V < Eredox < 3.05 V) react with polysulfides to form active surface-bound polythionate species that can engage in the surface redox chemistry of sulfur [214]. For example, the manganese(IV) oxide [MnO2] nanosheets (3.05 V) can oxidize the polysulfides [Li2Sx] to form thiosulfate [Li2S2O3]/polythionate [SnO6\n2 ] groups chemically bound to reduced metal oxide surface and function as a mediator for the sulfur redox on the surface [215]. The MnO2 nanosheet sulfur cathode presented a stable cycle life with sulfur host\nmaterials with a capacity decay rate of 0.036% per cycle over 2000 cycles. However, too strong binding between the transition metal and the polysulfide, which can induce destruction of Li2Sx species and potentially larger polarization, is not favored [216]. In addition, the decoration of transition metal-based compounds, such as cobalt sulfide [CoS2], has been reported to demonstrate the electrocatalyst effect beyond physical adsorption of polysulfide, which enhances the reduction of shortchain polysulfide to form solid lithium sulfide [Li2S] and promote the reaction kinetics [217].\nToward a Practical Application of Sulfur Cathodes Although significant progress has been made on the cathode research and development of Li-S batteries, there is still a big gap for their real-world application so far [218]. Most of the previous investigations were performed using thin film sulfur electrodes (<2 mg cm 2), a large amount of conducting porous carbon (30–40 wt % in electrodes) and flooded electrolyte usage, typically electrolyte/sulfur (E/S; μlE/ gS) ratio >20. This causes practical low-energy density of Li-S batteries, which is even much lower than current state-of-the-art lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide [LiNiCoAlO2, NCA-18650B. The battery is 18 mm wide and is 65 mm in length, and 0 is the division marker (650/10 = 65), and B is the battery chemistry with lithium as a cathode, an organic electrolyte, and carbon monofluoride as anode] cells [218]. To achieve a practical high-energy density in Li-S batteries, it is imperative to find solutions to increasing the sulfur loading and reducing the electrolyte without sacrificing the sulfur reaction kinetics for high energy in Li-S system [219]. Basically, it is much harder to prepare thick and dense sulfur cathode than conventional Li-ion cathodes due to the use of nanoporous carbon/sulfur composite materials, which causes electrode peer-off from current collector easier. On the other hand, it is remarkably challenging to reduce electrolyte usage in the Li-S system due to the highly porous carbon (C)/sulfur (S) composite cathode materials and poor reaction kinetics of insulating sulfur species. Nevertheless, we believe advanced sulfur architecture combined with functional electrolyte will be effective to address the above issues in Li-S batteries. Several useful approaches to increase sulfur loading and reduce electrolyte usage will be introduced, respectively.\nThick Sulfur Loading Electrodes Integrating the sulfur/carbon nanocomposite into large secondary particles is an effective way to reduce void space and surface area of composite materials, which is beneficial for preparing thick sulfur electrodes while retaining the good electronic contact and fast ion diffusion. For example, a facile and effective integrated approach of synthesizing micro-size particles from commercial potassium boride [KB] nanoparticles was reported for sulfur cathodes. Uniform and crack-free coating with high loading of 2–8 mg cm 2 sulfur have successfully been achieved with the integrated particles (Fig. 4.25) [220]. Binder is another important factor that directly affects the quality of sulfur cathodes. An in situ cross-linked binder was reported to construct stable and high volumetric energy density in Li-S batteries, by coupling multifunctional and hierarchically\n186 B. Liu and H. Pan\nstructured sulfur composite. The cross-linked elastomeric binder empowers the hierarchical sulfur composites with crack-free and high-loading electrodes using traditional slurry processing. Using this approach, electrodes with up to 14.9 mg cm 2 sulfur loading [221]. In addition, the 3D conducting framework constructed porous carbon such as graphene were demonstrated to be helpful to increase sulfur loading, accommodate the sulfur volume change, and provide an excellent conducting network for electrons and ions [222]. However, the highly porous 3D cathodes absorb too much electrolyte in practice, which should be carefully considered for real application in batteries.\nReducing Electrolyte Usage in Sulfur Cathodes There are basically two main challenges to reduce their electrolyte usage to achieve high energy in Li-S batteries. First, the currently used highly porous carbon/S composite cathode heavily requires a large amount of electrolyte to wet the whole electrode. Second, lean electrolyte condition causes poor sulfur reaction kinetics and reversibility (especially for the transportation from long-chain polysulfide [Li2Sx] to lithium sulfide [Li2S2/Li2S], large polarization, low sulfur utilization, and limited cycle life) [223]. Reducing the porosity of sulfur cathodes will directly favor the reduction of the needed electrolyte volume in sulfur cathodes. A low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 3.5 mlE gS\n1 was realized in coin cells for the high packing sulfur electrodes with integrated sulfur cathodes [221]. In contrast to the encapsulation approach for sulfur cathodes, Pan et al. revealed a new approach for sulfur cathodes that do not rely on sulfur encapsulation within high surface area carbon, called “non-encapsulation” approach (Fig. 4.26a and b) [224]. They used a low surface area, open carbon fiber architecture to control the nucleation and growth of the sulfur species by manipulating the carbon surface chemistry and the solvent properties, realizing ~100% sulfur utilization and high-energy density by in situ forming large sulfur sphere agglomerates (Fig. 4.26c and d). The large sulfur agglomerate well fills the void space in the carbon framework in the cathode and leads to high electrode density and volumetric energy of sulfur cathode and, therefore, benefits low electrolyte usage in practice. This finding offers an alternative approach for designing high-energy and low-cost Li-S batteries through controlling sulfur reaction on low-surface-area carbon.\nOn the other hand, considering the poor reaction kinetics of sulfur, it is extremely important to retain a good ionic conducting network under lean electrolyte condition. The limited electrolyte usually hardly distributes uniformly in conventional sulfur\ncathodes, which causes a large amount of inactive sulfur without contacting electrolyte, and therefore significantly reduces sulfur utilization and cycle life. Chen et al. recently reported a preformed ion conducting network for sulfur electrodes by using ionic conducting poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO10, [(CH2CH2O)100], lithium bis-trifluoromethanesulfonimide, LiTFSI) polymer as a binder [225]. The PEO10LiTFSI polymer gel immobilizes the electrolyte and confines polysulfides within the ion conducting phase and thus produces a stable sulfur/electrolyte reaction interface with a very thin layer of gel electrolyte surrounding, enabling smooth charge transfer on the interface. Avery lower E/S ratio of 3.3 mlE gS\n1 was achieved with a high capacity of 1200 mAh g 1 (one magnitude higher sulfur utilization than\nnonpolymer cathodes) and stable cycling. Such improvement is closely correlated with the excellent conductivity network across the cathode with very limited electrolyte volume [225].\nUntil now, reducing electrolyte usage in Li-S batteries is still challenging. Further understanding of the lean electrolyte system, i.e., reaction and failure mechanisms, is required to fully address the challenges under lean electrolyte condition and achieve high energy in Li-S batteries. One example is the limited cycling life of Li-S batteries under lean electrolyte condition [223]. The passivation by an accumulation of insulating Li2S in sulfur cathode during cycling was reported to be one important reason [223, 225]. In the future, combining the advanced sulfur cathode promoting high sulfur utilization with the optimized electrolyte addressing cathode passivation could promise a remarkable improvement to significantly extend the cycle life of high-energy Li-S batteries."

For example, the sulfide-based electrolytes such as lithium-sulfur phosphorus sulfide [Li2S-P2S5] were reported to present high ionic conductivity and excellent compatibility with sulfur cathodes, showing a stable cycling over 1000 cycles with an alternative indium-lithium [In-Li] alloy anode [226, 227]. The use of In-Li anode increases the cost significantly and sacrifices the energy density due to the higher voltage (~0.6 V vs Li) of alloy anode. On the other hand, the active sulfur content (typically <50%) in the sulfur cathode and applied current densities in solid-state Li-S batteries are currently quite low due to the large interfacial resistance of solid-solid interface. In the future, the active material ratio in the solid-state electrode should be increased for a practical high energy of solid batteries.

However, the fundamental understandings as well as battery technologies are criticized for the slow advancement and development of LIBs over the past 30 years [39, 155]. The current commercialized LIBs (LiCoO2 or LiFePO4 as cathode and graphite as anode) couldn’t satisfy the strong demand of widespread deployment for large-scale energy storages, which motivates the urgent exploration of new materials and structures for the next-generation batteries with high energy and power density as well as low cost and high safety. All-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) using solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) (Fig. 5.1) are of great interest to improve the overall performances, such as fundamentally solving the safety issue related to the flammable organic liquid electrolyte, absence of electrolyte leakage, wider temperature and electrochemical voltage tolerance, and ease of miniaturization [52, 135, 143]. SSEs could be classified into three types generally: organic polymers, inorganic electrolytes, and the composites. Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are easy to be synthesized with flexible shaped structure, easy lamination stacking, and low cost. In contrast, rigid inorganic ceramics with high elastic moduli are more stable in aggressive environments and are conceivable to be potentially fast charging without the concentration gradients of ions due to the almost unit Li-ion transference number (LTN).\nMoreover, the adoption of SSEs could prevent the Li dendrite growth, resolve the shuttle effect of dissoluble polysulfide for sulfur cathode, improve the stability of\n206 W. Liu\nbattery components due to open surroundings for air electrode, and subsequently promote the batteries based on Li metal anode coupling with high-capacity cathode materials, such as Li-S and Li-O2 batteries shown in Fig. 5.1. Lithium metal is the ideal anode material, on the fact that it has a high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g 1), the lowest negative electrochemical potential ( 3.040 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode), and a low density (0.59 g cm 3) [120, 132, 226]. As a result, Li metal has been first used in primary Li batteries since the 1970s and was used in Li-MoS2 batteries in the late 1980s by Moli Energy, but was abandoned and replaced by insertion carbonaceous anode later in 1991 by Sony Corporation, due to the uncontrolled Li dendrite growth that could penetrate the separator and cause short circuit and thermal runaway [190]. Meanwhile, scientists have also tried to replace liquid electrolyte by polymeric electrolytes to block dendrite growth, resulting in the Li metal polymer batteries [10]. Nevertheless, history repeats itself in recent years. Driven by the development of cathode chemistries with high specific capacities to meet the potentially high energy density of 500 Wh kg 1 for batteries, Li metal anode has become attractive again with extensive investigations. As indicated in Fig. 5.2a, b, the numbers of the literatures of the keyword of “Li metal anode” and “all-solid-state lithium battery” show a quick increase in recent 5 years. The most studied keywords in the publications from 2015 to 2018 can be found in Fig. 5.2c, such as lithium metal anode, Li-S batteries, conductivity, mechanism, Li-O2 batteries, solid-state, and LLZO, which reveal the related issues and studied approaches. Growing researches and various strategies have been proposed to circumvent the Li dendritic growth and the low CE during Li deposition/dissolution cycling. All-solid-state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) based on SSEs have been paid increasing attention recently.\nDespite considerate efforts have been devoted to study batteries based on SSEs since the year of 1960s, ASSLBs haven’t been fully commercialized, except the PEO-based\nbatteries operated at the temperatures higher than 60 C. The utilization of SSEs usually limits the electrochemical performances of the resultant batteries, especially the power density, which is mainly attributed to the low ionic conductivities, the high interfacial resistances, and the poor incompatibility with electrodes. To realize the practical applications of ASSLBs, SSEs need to satisfy the following requirements: (1) high ionic conductivity >10 4 S cm 1 and low electronic conductivity at room temperature (RT); (2) low interfacial electrolyte/electrode impedances and good compatibility with electrodes; (3) high chemical, electrochemical, thermal, and physical stabilities; (4) good mechanical strength; (5) high LTN closest to 1; and (6) easy fabrication with low cost. Disappointedly, till now, a SSE that could satisfy all the above requirements hasn’t explored. But, continuous progresses have been achieved attributed to many scientists and engineers’ great efforts. Along with the quick development of nanomaterials and nanotechnologies, various approaches have been proposed to solve the issues with SSEs, including fine processing, nanoscale interfacial engineering, nanocomposites and nanostructures, etc.\nIn this chapter, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of various SSEs in ASSLBs from fundamental ion-transport mechanisms to fabrication technologies. We then highlight the mechanism, modeling, and observation of Li nucleation and dendrite growth during Li plating/stripping cycling. The most important interfacial stability of SSEs with Li metal has been discussed systematically. Strategies based on nanoscaled chemistries and nanotechnologies to address the Li dendrite growth and the incompatibility of SSEs with Li metal anode have also been overviewed. Last, current challenges and future prospects of the next-generation ASSLMBs with high energy and power density, long cycling performance, low cost, high safety, and power grid compatibility toward commercialization are summarized."

      "text" : "As the performance-limiting factor, SSE plays a key role in battery, the current progresses and challenges of which are discussed in detail in this section. For solid ionic conductors, the ion transfer generally follows a random hopping, referred to as “universal dynamic response” (UDR) containing AC conductivity σ(ω) and DC conductivity σDC as below [61]:\nσ ωð Þ ¼ σDC þ Aωc (5:1) where ωp is characteristic frequency and c is a constant. DC conductivity could be determined according to a random walk theory:\nσDC ¼ f h ne2d2γ\n6kT\n(5:2)\nwhere fh = ωp is hopping rate, d is characteristic hopping distance, n is carrier concentration, e is charge, γ is a geometrical factor, and k is the Boltzmann constant.\n5 High-Energy All-Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries by Nanomaterial Designs 209\nHence, it can be seen that fast hopping rate, longer hopping distance, and larger ion concentration can result in higher ionic conductivity.\nIon transport in ionic solids is a thermally activated process, in which an energy barrier must be overcome. The dependence on temperature of the ionic conductivity for SSEs typically follows two dominant conduction mechanisms: Arrhenius relationship and Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) type. The crystalline polymer-salt complexes and inorganic ceramic electrolytes prefer to follow the Arrhenius behavior, while the ion transport in amorphous phase of SPEs showing strong coupling between ions with polymer segmental more satisfies the VTF equation [84]. The Arrhenius equation is described as follows:\nσ ¼ σ0 exp EakT\n(5:3)\nwhere σ0 is the pre-exponential factor related to the number of charge carriers and Ea is the activation energy that can be calculated from the slope of log σ vs. 1/T plot. The VTF type can be expressed according to the following empirical equation [163]:\nσ ¼ σ0T 12 exp Bk T T0ð Þ\n(5:4)\nwhere B is the pseudo-activation energy related to the segmental mobility of polymer chain and T0 is the equilibrium glass transition temperature (T0 Tg – 50 K). The linear Arrhenius relationship for SSEs indicates ion conduction is via a simple hopping mechanism unlike the VTF behavior. The plot of conductivity vs. 1/T for VTF is generally nonlinear due to the ion-conduction mechanism involving ion hopping associated with the segmental motion of polymeric chains."

[9], it has been intensively studied for various applications, including batteries, fuel cells, sensors, and electrochromic devices [8]. In the following past two decades, SPE has been one of the most challenging and passionately adored topics in the field of material science and solid-state electrochemistry. Other polymer hosts satisfying the requirements of flexible polymer chains and sufficient electron-donor atoms or groups to couple with cations by a suitable distance between coordinating centers have been also developed, such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-co-HFP), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and polyvinylchloride (PVC). To date, PEO-based electrolytes receive the most attention and are the most promising applicable candidates for ASSLIBs, due to their high power of\n210 W. Liu\nsolvating various kinds of salts, low glass transition temperature, good electrochemical stability, low cost and low toxicity.\nThe mobility of the cations dissolved in the polymer matrix is related to hopping from the coordination site to the neighboring one associated with the ether oxygen atoms in the polymer backbone, which is assisted by the motions of the segments of the polymer chain (i.e., PEOmonomer is –(CH2–CH2–O)–), as shown in Fig. 5.3a. Berthier and co-workers demonstrated that ion conduction preferentially took place in the amorphous region of PEO that is a semicrystalline polymer [20]. A consequence of the correlation indicates that the ionic motion is limited by the reluctant local segmental motion of the polymer host at ambient temperatures, which leads to a low ionic conductivity of 10 7 S cm 1 according to the following basic expression:\nσ ¼ X\nnieiμi (5:5)\nwhere n, e, and μ are the effective number of mobile ions, the electric charge, and the mobility of the i species, respectively. High ionic conductivity of 10 4 S cm 1 could be only achieved at the temperatures higher than 60 C [13]. Therefore, various approaches on reducing glass transition temperature with lower crystallinity have been proposed [52], including linear chain polymers [152], comb-branched polymers [71], adding plasticizers [17, 99] or solvents, polymer blends [200, 209], cross-linking [140],\n5 High-Energy All-Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries by Nanomaterial Designs 211\ncopolymers [54, 186], and hyperbranched derivatives [196]. Archer and Coates demonstrated a cross-linked polyethylene/poly(ethylene oxide) (PE/PEO) of very high ionic conductivity of >1.0 10 4 S cm 1 at RT, with a same order of magnitude shear moduli as lithium, which could be used in ASSLMBs [98].\nAlong with the reduction the crystalline phase, the number of free ions depending on the degree of salt dissociation in the polymer host could be increased via the above approaches. Adding of plasticizer or fillers in SSEs may promote dissociation of ions, which results in more free ions for transport and subsequently improves ionic conductivity. The salts with large anions can easily be dissociated in the polymer matrix releasing free Li-ions and also prevent polymer crystallization process with increased amorphous region, which consequently promote the Li-ion conductivity. Lithium bis (trifluoromethane sulfonimide) (LiTFSI) is a promising lithium salt but relatively expensive that has a high solubility and good electrochemical stability, which results in a high ionic conductivity of 10 5 S cm 1 for SPEs [94, 107, 197]. However, the interfacial stability of the PEO-LiTFSI electrolyte with Li metal anode is relatively poor. Lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB) is also a good lithium salt with large anions and the ability to delocalize charge and reduce anion-cation reactions, via the bulky anion BOB. Scrosati et al. [7, 42, 224] reported the PEO-LiBOB electrolyte, showing high ionic conductivity of 10 4 S cm 1 at 40 C.\nFurthermore, alternative approaches to enhance ionic conductivity by enhancing LTN (the ratio of Li+ to the total cationic and anionic carrier ions) have been proposed. Improving LTN could reduce the concentration gradients built by the anions that is also important on power density of LIBs [43]. But, LTN is generally lower than 0.3–0.4, since both cations and anions are mobile in the polymer host under electrical voltage. Single-ion conductors with the ability of reduced anion mobility can overcome the above issue. For example, affixing anions to polymer backbone and adding anion receptor are effective approaches to obtain a single-ion conducting polymer, which unfortunately usually leads to ionic conductivity of lower than 10 5 S cm 1 [153, 216]. Bouchet et al. [24] demonstrated a single-ion P(STFSILi)-PEO-P(STFSILi) triblock copolymers, showing an ionic conductivity of 1.3 10 5 S cm 1 at 60 C, with improved mechanical strength and enlarged electrochemical stability window.\nIn addition, although it is well accepted that the cations prefer to transport through the amorphous region of SPEs, the cations enclosed within the helices of PEO-based electrolytes can transport along the helical axis, but leading to a short-range motion. In 1999, ion transport was observed that occur not only in amorphous region of polymers but also in crystalline polymers (Fig. 5.4). Some pioneers such as Peter G. Bruce have studied the PEO/Li salt complex crystals indicating that PEO chains formed helical structures, showing comparable conductivity with the amorphous polymer electrolytes [139]. Hence, manipulation of polymer chains to the desired orientation is of great importance to achieve a long-range ordered pathway, which results in anisotropic ionic conductivity as well as mechanical property for SPEs. Later, various study demonstrated the influences of crystallization and chain orientation on the ion transportation in SPEs [60]. For the commonly used method of casting from solution, the planar orientation of helices is preferred to be parallel to\n212 W. Liu\nthe substrate plane. However, for practical applications, the preferred order along perpendicular direction is more crucial [40, 67]. Anodic oxidation of aluminum (AAO) was used to confine PEO, showing higher ionic conductivity in smaller pores, which is due to the reduced crystallinity and the stretching and ordering of the polymer backbone [23]. Golodnitsky et al. [68] demonstrated an orientation of the helices along the perpendicular direction for PEO-based electrolytes, prepared by applying a magnetic field during polymer solution casting and drying. The ordering resulted in one order magnitude enhancement on ionic conductivity. Majewski et al. [141] reported a more detailed study on the ion transportation of PEO-based electrolytes with respect to chain orientation. The ionic conductivity comparison for the aligned PEO cylinders in two orthogonal directions and the random polymer\nis shown in Fig. 5.4, indicating an increased conductivity by the order of the parallel, the random, and the perpendicular sample. The anisotropy in conductivity decreased with rising temperature especially over 60 C, indicating that the phase changed to the disordered melt polymer [141]. Christopher Y. Li group [181] demonstrated SPEs with tunable and ordered ion-conducting pathways of a few tens of nanometers to micrometers, prepared by a holographic polymerization method. The ratio of “inplane” conductivity to “through-plane” conductivity ionic could reach up to 37.\nIt should be noted that the considerable and sustained efforts have been made on the enhancement of ionic conductivities of SPEs, but a qualified material with satisfied ionic conductivity without sacrificing mechanical property and electrochemical and thermal stability still needs to be exploited. Moreover, although SPEs are more flexible and volume comfortable compared with the rigid inorganic electrolytes, the high interfacial resistance and poor compatibility with electrodes, especially with the most ideal anode, lithium metal, remain the limitation on the wide applications in the field of lithium batteries with high energy density and long cycle durability."

      "text" : "For decades, a large number of inorganic electrolytes have been studied, including lithium phosphorous oxynitride (LiPON), perovskite type, garnet oxides, NASICON (sodium superionic conductor)-type phosphates, LISICON (lithium-ion superionic conductor) and thio-LISICON-type, and sulfide glasses. The reported ionic conductivities of currently studied inorganic SSEs are shown in Fig. 5.5 [14]. Li3N has a high ionic conductivity close to 1.0 10 3 S cm 1 at RT, but the low decomposition voltage limits its applications [5, 108]. LiPON generally prepared by radiofrequency magnetron sputtering showing a low conductivity of 2 10 6 S cm 1 at RT has been studied for thin-film ASSLIBs [82].\nLi3xLa2/3 x☐1/3 2xTiO3 (0.04 < x < 0.17) is perovskite (ABO3) structured solid ion conductors deriving from La2/3☐1/3TiO3, which shows grain conductivity up to 10 3 S cm 1 (x~0.1) and total ionic conductivity of 10 5 S cm 1 due to highly resistive grain boundary [97, 185]. LLTO generally shows two types of crystal structure: cubic α-LLTO (space group Pm3m) of randomly arranged Li+ and La3+ over the A sites and tetragonal β-LLTO with (P4/mmm) with ordering distribution of Li+ and La3+ on A sites. In the tetragonal LLTO, the alternate stacking of La-rich layer and La-poor layer along the c-axis with a square planar bottleneck formed between A sites dominates the Li-ion migration by the vacancy mechanism, which shows lower ionic conductivity than cubic LLTO (Fig. 5.5b). To further improve ionic conductivity of LLTO, A, B, or A and B substitutions have been intensely investigated. Dopants that could stabilize the cubic structure and expand the “bottleneck” of LLTO are favorable for the conductivity enhancement [1]. A-site substitution of Al and Sr in LLTO could improve bulk ionic conductivity from 1.32 10 3 to 2.95 10 3 and 2.54 10 3 S cm 1, respectively [161]. Zr4+ doping increased the total ionic conductivity of LLTO slightly from 3.08 10 5 to\n214 W. Liu\n5.84 10 5 S cm 1 [122]. Furthermore, many strategies have been proposed to further improve the total ionic conductivity by increasing the Li-ion conduction along grain boundaries, including high sinter temperature [106] and adding additives. The additives such as amorphous silica and Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) have been used to modify grain boundaries to enhance the total ionic conductivity to 1.0 10 4 and 1.2 10 4 S cm 1 at RT [145]. Moreover, to overcome the high grain boundary resistance, amorphous LLTO electrolytes have been prepared successfully, by sol-gel method [249], pulsed laser deposition (PLD) [144], and RF magnetron sputtering [223]. It is believed that the local arrangement of Ti in amorphous LLTO with a less dense atomic packing is similar to that in crystalline counterpart. The amorphous LLTO thin films prepared by a sol-gel method showed an ionic conductivity of 4.5 10 6 S cm 1 at 30 C, which is due to the open space and disordered structure [249]. It also found that the amorphous LLTO thin film prepared by PLD showed a higher ionic conductivity of 8.98 10 4 S cm 1 [142]. Ahn et al. demonstrated that the amorphous LLTO prepared by PLD with an ionic conductivity of 2.0 10 5 S cm 1 at RT showed a good stability with Li metal [3]. In addition, Zheng et al. found that the amorphous LLTO remained an ionic conductor behavior when contact with metallic lithium from the results of normalized chronoamperometric curves, which is different from the crystalline counterpart showing an electronic conductor. Hence, although the amorphous LLTO also undergoes the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ with Li metal, a stable ion-conductive SEI layer without electronic conduction could be formed at the interface due to the localized disorder, showing a high LTN > 0.82 and wide electrochemical voltage window up to 12 V [250].\nThe NASICON framework generally has the formula of AxBy(PO4)3, where A and B are monovalent and multivalent (Ti, Ge, Hf, Zr, Sn) cations, with a rhombohedral unit cell and space group of R 3c (Fig. 5.5c). The composition of LiTi2(PO4)3- and LiGe2P3O12-based materials are the most promising electrolytes among the NASICON-type SSEs, which was originally developed by Fu and co-workers [55, 56]. The ionic conductivity could be greatly improved by partial aliovalent substitution, such as Al3+, Sc3+, Zn2+, and Ca2+. Among them, Li1+xAlxGe2 xP3O12 (LAGP, 0 x 1.2) and Li1+xAlxTi1 x(PO4)3 (LATP) systems are the most studied with RT ionic conductivities of 10 3 to 10 5 S cm 1, which is strongly dependent on the preparation method and composition. Compared with polycrystalline materials, glassceramics with low grain boundary resistance are more easily manufactured into a desired shape and size [126]. The Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 glass-ceramic prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique was reported to show a high ionic conductivity of 1.12 10 3 S cm 1 at RT [225]. But, similar as perovskites LLTO, LATP is not stable with lithium metal due to the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ leading to a high electronic conductivity. LAGP is more stable in comparison to LATP. A LATP/LAGP double layer with no defects and good stability with lithium metal showed an electrical conductivity of 3.4 10 4 S cm 1 and an electronic conductivity of 9.6 10 9 S cm 1 at RT [246]. The composition of Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6P3O12 prepared by a sol-gel process demonstrated a total conductivity of 1.22 10 3 cm 1 at RT [242]. LAGP glass-ceramic with x= 0.5 prepared by the melt-quenching technique showed an ionic conductivity as high\n216 W. Liu\nas 5.08 10 3 S cm 1 at 27 C [193]. However, the dopant of Al3+ is effective to improve ion mobility in NASICON-type electrolytes, but it should be noted that the impurity phase of less conducting phase AlPO4 was observed at the surfaces in both LATP- and LAGP-based materials [192]. In addition, it should be noted that the raw material of germanium Ge is expensive to enhance the battery cost according to a real practical application.\nRecently, the most studied inorganic Li-ion conductors is garnet-based electrolytes with the formula of LixLa3M2O12 (M = Ta, Nb, Zr). Among the garnet oxides, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has been received the most interest, since the first report in 2007 by Murugan et al., which showed an ionic conductivity of 2.44 10 4 S cm 1 and a good stability with lithium metal and a wide electrochemical window [151]. LLZO was observed to have two crystal polymorphs: high-temperature cubic phase and low-temperature tetragonal phase [65]. The former with a space group of I41/acd exhibits two orders of magnitude higher in ionic conductivity than the latter with completely ordered distribution of lithium-ions of Ia3d, as shown in Fig. 5.5d. To stabilize the cubic phase and enhance ionic conductivity of LLZO, various cation dopants, such as Al3+ [65], Ga3+ [219], Nb5+ [130], and W6+ [109], have been proposed to have a positive effect on increasing the number of vacancies and the disordered degree of Li sublattice. Xin Guo group [219] demonstrated the highest ionic conductivity of 1.46 10 3 S cm 1 at RTwith a low activation energy of 0.25 eV for the garnet-based electrolytes with the composition of Li7 3xGaxLa3Zr2O12 at x = 0.25 prepared by solid-state reaction. They believed that the high ionic conductivity is due to a high Li-ion mobility from the Coulombic repulsion between Ga3+ and Li+. The Li-ion transport varies with crystal direction, and recently it is found that self-textured Ga-LLZO with a strong (420) preferred orientation showed a high ionic conductivity of 2.06 10 3 S cm 1 at RT that is six times higher than of the non-textured one, which is due to a shorter and less tortuous ion conduction pathways [162]. It is also interesting to note that although garnetbased ion conductors were reported to have good stability compared with other SSEs, it was found in further literatures that LLZO electrolyte could be aged by reacting with CO2/H2O in air forming Li2CO3 and LiOH. It was shown that protons entered the lattice of LLZO and replaced the less mobile Li-ions in the tetrahedral sites. The H+/Li+ exchange reaction could degrade the sintered bulk integrity and reduce ionic conductivity [86, 220]. Nb and Y have been used to co-doped LLZO electrolyte to improve the stability in air, which showed an ionic conductivity 6.91 10 4 S cm 1 at 30 C without change after exposure in air for 1.5 months [62]. The addition of 2 wt.% LiF was able to improve the stability of garnet ceramic against moist air [111, 112].\nTo date, sulfide-type electrolytes have been reported to show the highest ionic conductivities up to 10 2 S cm 1 among SSEs, comparable to liquid electrolyte. Crystalline, amorphous, and partially crystalline structures could be observed in sulfides. Compared with oxygen, sulfur possesses larger ionic radius, which results in a more open ion channels in the structure and a higher ionic mobility. In 1981, the first sulfide-based glass as SSE was reported (Mercier et al. 1981). In 1984, Tachez and co-workers reported a crystalline sulfide electrolyte with the composition of\n5 High-Energy All-Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries by Nanomaterial Designs 217\nLi3PS4, showing a conductivity of 3 10 7 S cm 1 with an activation energy of 0.46 eV. Following that, various Li-P-S systems have been studied with respect to ionic conductivity [202]. As the pioneers to study the sulfide-based SSEs, Kanno and co-workers first reported the crystalline sulfide of thio-LISICON-type structure Li4 xGe1 xPxS4 with ionic conductivities >10\n3 S cm 1 in 2001 [93]. In 2011, Kamaya et al. [90] reported a breakthrough work on a solid Li-ion conductor Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) with a 3D framework structure and 1D Li-ion transport pathway formed by the PS4 and (P/Ge)S4 tetrahedra tunnels along c-axis, as shown in Fig. 5.5e. LGPS has a super high ionic conductivity of 1.2 10 2 S cm 1, comparable to liquid electrolyte, a very low electronic conductivity of 5.7 nS cm 1 at RT, and a low activation energy of 24 kJ mol 1. Very recently, a glass-ceramic Li7P3S11 (LPS) electrolyte with even higher ionic conductivity of 1.7 10 2 S cm 1 at RT and a lower activation energy of 17 kJ mol 1 was demonstrated, due to the reduced grain boundary resistance [178]. It believed that LPS is triclinic with the space group of P1, showing Li-ion transport along zigzag chains between P2S7 di-tetrahedra and slightly distorted PS4 tetrahedra in the open space, as illustrated in Fig. 5.5f [212]. The fundamental understanding on the high ionic conductivity of SSEs compared to liquid electrolyte was reported by Ceder and co-workers [203]. They calculated and found that body-centered cubic (BCC)-like anion frameworks delivered a fast Li-ion transport pathway via a network of interconnected tetrahedral sites, which is in agreement with the reported experiment results. To study the common feature for the superionic conductors, Yifei Mo group [78] used ab initio modeling to predict that Li-ion diffusion behavior and found that Li-ion occupied high-energy sites and transport via concerted migrations of multiple ions, with low migration energy barriers, rather than the model of isolated ion hopping that is typical in ionic solid conductors, as illustrated in Fig. 5.5g."

      "text" : "Over the last few decades, solid composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) with incorporated inorganic fillers have been attracted much attention, which could improve the overall performance, including increased ionic conductivity, LTN, voltage window, electrolyte/electrode compatibility, and mechanical strength. Extensive investigations on complexion in SSEs have been reported since the first demonstration on Li-ion conductivity improvement by adding Al2O3 in LiI with a large rations in 1973 [116]. Due to the fast ion transport along interfaces, a percolation effect was used to explain the conductivity enhancement in the composite electrolytes. Later, Maier et al. found that a dramatically large lateral ionic conductivity of heterolayered CaF2/BaF2 thin films with a proportion to the number of interfaces [173]. Similar discover was found in the Y2O3-doped ZrO2 (YSZ)/SrTiO3 epitaxial multilayers, showing an eight orders of magnitude enhancement in total conductivity [64].\nIn 1982, Weston and Steele reported the PEO-LiClO4 CPE with α-Al2O3 fillers for the first time, showing improved ionic conductivity as well as mechanical properties (Weston and Steele 1982). Since then, extensive investigations on inorganic fillers in\n218 W. Liu\nCPEs have been carried out, especially the nanoscale ceramic fillers with large specific surface area, including passive fillers such as Al2O3 [201], SiO2 [100, 154], TiO2 ([118]; Croce et al. 1998), ZrO2 [194], Sm2O3 [38], BN [104], and clay [121] and active ones (Table 5.1) such as Li3N [50], LiAlO2 [89], LAGP [87], LLTO [123], LLZO [244], and LGPS [248]. Nan group [204] demonstrated a PVDF-based CPE with Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (LLZTO) ceramic nanoparticles (NPs), showing a high ionic conductivity of 5 10 4 S cm 1 at RT with good mechanical strength and thermal stability [244]. The PEO-LiClO4 composite electrolyte with 10 wt.% LATP nanoparticles exhibited an ionic conductivity of 1.70 10 4 S cm 1 at 20 C. It was suggested that two contributions play the dominated role on the enhanced ionic conductivity, including reduced crystallinity degree of polymer host and highly conductive interface between organic polymer and inorganic filler. Scrosati et al. [177] demonstrated that the addition of these nanofillers could hinder the polymer reorganization and result in a lower crystallinity degree with long-term stability of the amorphous phase, allowing Li-ions to move more freely on the interfaces. The pioneers Wieczorek and co-workers suggested that the surface groups of the ceramic nanofillers associated with polymer chain and lithium salts by Lewis acid-base type interactions, which resulted in the promotion of salt dissociation and increase of the concentration of free Li-ions (Wieczorek et al. 1989; [215]).\n5 High-Energy All-Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries by Nanomaterial Designs 219\nMost recently, compared with isolated nanoparticles, randomly dispersed one-dimensional (1D) ceramic nanofillers could build a continuous three-dimensional (3D) ion-conducting network, which provides a significant enhancement of ionic conductivity. Liu et al. [123] originally reported PAN-based CPEs with Li-ion conductive nanowires with an extremely high ionic conductivity of 2.4 10 4 S cm 1 at RT, which showed three and two orders magnitude enhancement of ionic conductivity in comparison to the filler-free electrolyte and the corresponding NP-filled polymer electrolyte. In this work, 1D inorganic Li-ion conductor (Li0.33La0.557TiO3) was prepared for the first time by electrospinning. Later, LLZO nanowires were reported to effectively improve ionic conductivity of SPEs [57, 230, 231]. To achieve a high ionic conductivity according to percolation of nanofillers, some ceramic scaffolds have been proposed. Liangbing Hu group [57] demonstrated a CPE with 3D inorganic matrix of garnet nanofibers and PEO polymer with lithium salt, which showed an ionic conductivity of 2.5 10 4 S cm 1 at RT. Guihua Yu group [15] synthesized a hydrogel-derived LLTO framework composited with PEO-based SPE, showing an ionic conductivity of 8.8 10 5 S cm 1 at RT. Goodenough group [32] proposed a concept of from “ceramic-in-polymer” to “polymer-in-ceramic” with the ability of polymer host to ceramic matrix, as shown in Fig. 5.6a. The PEO-LLZO-PEG (10:85:5) with 60 wt.% LiTFSI prepared by hot pressing showed an ionic conductivity of 6.24 10 5 at RTand a good stability against Li metal anode. It is worth noting that the ionic conductivity of CPEs could be further improved via the approach of aligning the NWs that attributed to continuous transport pathways without resistive junctions like NPs and random distributed NWs. After the development of random NW-filled SPE, Liu et al. [130] demonstrated a CPE with aligned LLTO NWs that were parallel to electrode direction (Fig. 5.6b), which showed one order magnitude enhancement of ionic conductivity, compared with the one with random NWs. The approaches of controlling Li-ion transport pathway with the help of aligned nanofillers were also realized in several other publications [240, 245]. Yuan yang group [240] developed a CPE with vertically aligned and connected LATP NPs via ice templating method, which showed an ionic conductivity of 5.2 10 5 S cm 1 at RT, 3.6 times higher than that of CPE with randomly dispersed LATP NPs. Yi Cui group [245] exploited vertically aligned nanoscale ceramic/polymer interfaces with densely packing, via a surface-modified anodized aluminum oxide with filled PEO-LiTFSI, showing a high ionic conductivity of 10 3 S cm 1 at 0 C. An extremely high conductivity of 5.82 10 4 S cm 1 was achieved in the composite electrolyte at RT. Hence, it is important to control the orientation of nanofillers to improve electrical properties of the composite electrolytes."

      "text" : "In addition to the study on the material synthesis with modification of composition, it is also critical to develop unconventional configurations for battery structures based on the novel fabrication technologies [69, 198]. Planar structured LIBs have been occupying the main market share, but the energy density and capacity are limiting. Various 3D structures with a focus on electrode/electrolyte interfaces for LIBs have been studied to\n220 W. Liu\nimprove the electrochemical performances, especially the energy density, due to not only large contact area between electrode and electrolyte but also high loading of active materials and modified electron/ion pathways. Several configurations of 3D batteries have been proposed, including array of interdigital array of electrode pillars, interdigital array of electrode plates, rod array of cylindrical anodes with a thin electrolyte coating and filled cathode material in the remaining free space, and sponge-type cathode with thin electrolyte coating and filled anode in the remaining free space, as illustrated in Fig. 5.7a [134]. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5.7b, compared with liquid electrolyte that could wet the electrodes, the solid electrolyte leads to a poor contact with the electrodes, leading to a large interfacial resistance. Hence, the large surface area in 3D battery could improve the contact between solid electrolyte with electrodes [103].\nSun and co-workers built 3D microbatteries (3D-MBs) based on a poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC)-based electrolyte with a high LTN >0.6 and a high ionic conductivities of ~10 5 S cm 1 at RT. A 3D current collect was first prepared, active material and PTMC-based electrolyte was then coated on it. The 3D-MBs based on PTMC could stably cycling with an areal capacity of 0.2 mAh cm 2 at ambient temperature 22 1 C [187]. In addition, the membrane of Cu2O-coated Cu nanopillars has also been as the 3D supporter in the above work. Ergang et al. [49] demonstrated a 3D interpenetrating electrochemical cell based on ordered carbon nanosphere anode, as shown in Fig. 5.7c. The solid electrolyte of poly(phenylene oxide) (PPO) and V2O5 cathode were later coated on the carbon anode. The reversible specific capacity was increased from 0.7 to 350 μAh g 1, by forming the V2O5 cathode from xerogel to ambigel, due to improved Li\n+ diffusion. In addition, inorganic electrolytes have also been adopted in 3D ASSLBs. Notten et al. demonstrated an ASS 3D-integrated battery based on Si thin film anode, LCO cathode, and LiPON electrolyte, from a silicon substrate with high surface area using the micro-etching and deposition technologies. 3D ASSLBs have also been fabricated from the support of solid electrolytes. For example, LLTOmembrane with micro-sized holes, a honeycomb structure, has been prepared for 3D ASSLIBs. The mixtures including active materials of LCO and Li4Mn5O12 (LMO) were then filled into the holes of the LLTO membrane. The resultant 3D solid LCO/LLTO/LMO cell could deliver a small\n222 W. Liu\ndischarge capacity of 7.3 μAh cm 2 [102]. To address the high interfacial resistance, ion-conducting components are needed to mix with active electrode materials, such as polymer-Li salt and inorganic electrolyte NPs, while the inorganic nanoparticles are distributed isolately in the composite electrode, showing sluggish ionic Li-ion conduction pathway. Recently, Liangbing Hu group [59] demonstrated a 3D bilayer garnetbased SSE framework (Fig. 5.7d), consisting of a thin dense LLZO layer with a thickness of 20 μm and a thick porous LLZO layer with a thickness of 50–100 μm. The sulfur cathode was filled into the pores of this bilayer electrolyte. The ASSLSBwith a high sulfur loading of >7 mg cm 2 showed a high discharge capacity is around 645 mAh g 1 at the current density of 0.2 mA cm 2 at the first cycle, and high CE >99% for the subsequent cycles, indicating that the “shuttle effect” was blocked by the dense layer. A high energy density of 248.2 Wh kg 1 based on the total mass of the electrolyte with sulfur cathode and Li metal anode was achieved. Moreover, Li metal could also be filled into the pores to achieve a composite Li metal anode without volume change during cycling. The Li(Ni0.5Mn0.3Co0.2)O2 (NMC)/garnet/Li cells, with a high NMC mass loading of 32 mg cm 2, could deliver a high energy densities of 329 Wh kg 1 and 972 Wh L 1 [133]."

      "text" : "With the ever-increasing demand on high-energy-density energy storages, lithium metal anode as the “holy grail” in the field of rechargeable lithium batteries has been revived since the most recent years. Lithium metal is the ideal anode material attributed to the high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g 1), the low redox potential ( 3.040 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode), and the low relative density [4, 120, 125, 131, 195, 243]. In addition, as the development of high-capacity chemistries taking place of conventional intercalation cathodes, such as sulfur cathode and oxygen electrode for Li-S and Li-O2 batteries, lithium metal as anode is highly needed. The advantages of lithium metal anode are very clear, but the problems with failure mechanisms it confront with are also critical to limit its practical applications in the field of batteries. The most serious and detrimental issue is the dendrite growth at the lithium surface during repeated charging/ discharging, which could penetrate the separator, cause internal short circuit, and lead to thermal runaway. It is possible that the dendrites break off leading to “dead lithium” floated on the lithium surface and the pulverizing of lithium metal. The second issue is the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Li metal surface with electrolyte, due to the highly reactive feature of lithium metal with high Fermi energy level, leading to the consumption of lithium metal as well as electrolyte, increase of internal resistance, and the subsequently low Coulombic efficiency (CE) and poor cycling performance [35, 115]. The SEI layer is easy to break upon the infinite volume change during Li plating/stripping, resulting in the exposure of fresh lithium metal and continuous generation of thick SEI. The large and repeatable volume change also creates the accommodation of large strain and reduces the electrochemical performance of lithium metal anode.\n5 High-Energy All-Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries by Nanomaterial Designs 223"

      "text" : "The fundamental understanding on Li nucleation and growth during Li platting/ stripping cycling is critical to guide experiments for stabilizing Li metal anode [87, 217]. According to the fundamentals of materials science, the formation of a new phase in a parent phase results in a Gibbs free energy change ΔG with respect to several contributions [27]:\nΔG ¼ ΔGchem þ ΔGint þ ΔGstrain ¼ 43 πr 3 ΔGvchem þ ΔGvstrain þ 4πr2γ (5:6)\nwhere ΔGchem (<0) is the chemical energy change driving the phase transformation, ΔGint (>0) is the interface/surface energy change due to the nuclei formation of new phase, and ΔGstrain (>0) is the strain energy derived from the volume difference of precipitates from the volume they occupied. ΔGvchem and ΔG v strain are the chemical energy and the strain energy change per unit volume, respectively, and γ is the interfacial energy per area. The nuclei could continuously grow with decreased free energy when the critical radius could be reached by the energy fluctuation to overcome the energy barrier.\nFor the last two decades, various theory models of electrochemical systems based on the well-established phase field method numerically and analytically have been proposed to study the behavior of Li nucleation and dendrite growth, by charge mass transfer through the binary electrolyte (salt dissolved in solvent) to the negative and positive electrodes and the cation reduction on the anode surface under polarization, as shown in Fig. 5.8a [31]. The open circuit voltage (OCV) is dependent on the chemical potential difference between the anode (μA) and the cathode (μC) and working voltage also limited by the electrolyte electrochemical window that is the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (Fig. 5.8b) [70]. The classical Butler-Volmer kinetics could describe the Li metal deposition and the deposited rate, with the dependences on the cation concentration at the anode surface and the overpotential, as follows [117, 149]:\nin ¼ i0,ref exp 1 Dað ÞΔμe RT\nexp DaFηs RT\nexp DcFηs\nRT\n(5:7)\nwhere in is current density at the deformed interface, i0,ref is the exchange current density at an undeformed interface, Da and Dc are the anodic and cathodic diffusion coefficients,Δμe is the change of electrochemical potential in the electrons, ηs is the surface overpotential, R is the gas constant, F is the Faraday’s constant, and T is the temperature. Generally, a diffusion limited growth system resulting in a local concentration gradient is proposed that could lead to unstable dendrite growth at the negative electrode surface. Under high current densities exceeding diffusion limitation, the cation concentration could drop to zero resulting in a local space\n224 W. Liu\ncharge at the electrode surface, leading to the transition from charge transfer control to mass transfer process and the subsequently ramified deposits. The corresponding time is Sand’s time according to the following equations [170, 172]:\nτS ¼ πD zceCc02 in 2 μa þ μc μa 2 (5:8)\nD ¼ μaDc þ μcDa μa þ μc\n(5:9)\nwhere D is the ambipolar diffusion constant, μa and μc the anion and the cation mobilities, zc the cation charge number, and Cc0 the initial cation concentration. Therefore, it can be seen that low current densities prefer to a stable Li plating/ stripping cycling and high current densities promote the heterogeneous growth. The pioneer Chazalviel demonstrated that at high current densities, the velocity of dendrite growth appeared is proportional to the anion mobility in the electrolyte and the applied electric field [31]. Meanwhile, Monroe and Newman [148] indicated\nthat the dendrite growth velocity is proportional to the overpotential and inversely proportional to the curvature of dendrites. Kanamura et al. [94] conducted experiments and found that the deposited lithium metal on Ni substrate changed from a smooth hemisphere structure with diameter of 0.3 μm to a mixture of smooth Li and Li dendrite, and to most region of Li dendrite, when the current density increased from 0.2 to 2.0 and then to 10.0 mA cm2, while Li filaments could be appeared even at small current densities in some investigations. JM Tarascon and co-workers believed that the dendrite growth model could not simply be studied according to lithium gradient concentration but the Li surface state should be taken into consideration as well. They conducted lithium deposition on lithium metal and found that lithium metal preferred to grow in deep defects with higher electric field, where induced variations in local current density [28]. Dendrite-free mossy lithium metal could be obtained by lithium electrochemical plating and PLD on polished lithium foil, but the dendrite lithium deposits could not be unavoidable upon extended cycling due to the intrinsic inner lithium microstructure [66].\nRecently, it summarized that five steps toward the final lithium dendrite structure during homogeneous deposition: the nucleation suppression, the long incubation time, the short incubation time, the early dendrite growth, and the late growth regime [47]. The lithium embryos in the first step are thermodynamically unstable and are easy to be redissolved in the electrolyte. The critical overpotential could determine the incubation time for the embryos to grow kinetically. The time for nucleation incubation was determined to be proportional to Sand’s time [25]. In the early dendrite growth regime, the thermodynamically and kinetically favored nuclei could grow to reach the same growth velocity, and in the late dendrite growth regime, uniformed deposited structure with localized electric fields could control the next morphology of the deposit [47].\nThe fundamental understanding on the Li nuclei and dendrite growth is critical to design new material and structure to stable lithium metal anode. It is clear that current densities, salt concentration, surface defects, and substrate feature have strong influences on lithium plating/stripping. Moreover, the interfacial stress generated at the solid/solid interface upon the Li nucleation could also affect the lithium dendrite growth [30]. Compressive stress during Li plating could provide the driving force to push out Li filaments at localized diffusional creep. Recently, it was found that Li dendrite was be suppressed by the use of a soft substrate of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), as a result of the surface-wrinkling-induced stress relaxation [206]. More obviously, it is found that the morphology of deposited lithium metal at higher applied pressure is more uniform and dense [66]. assembled the Li/V2O5-P2O5 cells and then coated the gasket with ethylenepropylene-diene monomer (EPDM)/toluene emulsion. A hydraulic hand press fitted with an iron cylinder with the same diameter as the Li metal anode was applied on the test cells. The SEM images indicated that dense and uniform Li metal could be deposited under pressure, which is due to the good electrical path between deposited Li particles and anode substrate.\nMoreover, surface diffusion prefers to smooth out the cavities or protrusions on Li surface, with physically meaningful rates at temperature range of 0.5TM to\n226 W. Liu\n0.75TM (TM is the melting temperature) of the metal [165]. Therefore, temperature is also a factor that can influence the morphology of deposited lithium metal. It is reported that mushroom-shaped lithium deposit was obtained at temperatures lower than 5 C with a shorter incubation time and needlelike lithium was found at temperatures higher than 5 C [136]. In addition, it was observed that in the Li/PEO/Li symmetric cell, several Li dendrites growth with a proximately same velocity and only one first contact with the cathode that acted as a fuse and burnt under high current densities [170]. While and recently, Li et al. [113] demonstrated a dendrite healing mechanism with respect to temperature under even higher current densities. They found that Li dendrite protrusion could be disappeared and return to smooth morphology under current densities >9 mA cm 2, which is due to the surface migration dependent on temperature by self-heating under high current densities."

      "text" : "In the past two decades, morphology observations and technologies on the Li nuclei and growth using advanced facilities, including optical microscopy (OM) [182], scanning electron microscopy (SEM) [189], atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [144, 171, 205, 236, 238], X-ray microtomography [75], nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [21], and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [199], have been utilized to analyze the behavior of Li electrochemical deposition/dissolution [226]. Lithium dendrite was first observed by SEM in 1980 [48], and later in situ morphological observations on lithium deposition under galvanostatic cycling were studied since the late 1980s [18]. Lithium dendrite growth based on tip mode that lithium metal deposits on the surface of pre-deposited lithium nuclei under the SEI layer has been widely observed and accepted. But, other growth behaviors have also been observed. It is believed that if the adhesion between deposited lithium and substrate is strong, a surface growth mode is preferred; if the contact is weak, a root growth mode that lithium deposits on the electrode substrate is more likely to occur [241], while, as shown in Fig. 5.9a, b, Bai et al. observed the deposited lithium structure in liquid electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC using a glass capillary cell by an OM and found two different mechanisms with respect to the applied current and capacity. Mossy lithium from the roots was observed below Sand’s capacity with a reaction limitation, and then it transferred to dendritic lithium growth at the tips above Sand’s time with a transport limitation growth [16]. In addition to the tip mode and root mode, lithium growth in between kinks have also been observed [182, 183].\nRecently, Bazant and Li groups [105] observed that by in situ TEM in liquid cell (Fig. 5.9c), the surface growth with a morphology of densely packed “buds” and the root growth with a morphology of loosed “whiskers” showed strong dependence on the SEI growth rate and overpotential.

It is worth noting that the atomic-resolution imaging of lithium metal that is beam-sensitive was obtained for the first time using cryo-TEM from Yi Cui group, indicating a big breakthrough, as illustrated in Fig. 5.9e [112]. They demonstrated that Li metal dendrites prepared by electrochemically deposited onto a Cu TEM grid were single-crystalline nanowires with preferred crystal faces (Fig. 5.9f). And, the SEI layer was found to be Li carbonate and Li oxide without the trace of LiF. While, Ying Shirley Meng and co-workers [205] found that the electrochemically deposited Li metal is amorphous, with organic species and crystalline LiF on its surface. Further investigations by the utilization of TEM are needed to study the atomic-resolution imaging of electrochemically deposited lithium metal. In addition, lithium dendrite growth was also observed by real-time AFM under a galvanostatic condition [101]. Transmission grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering transmission (GISAXS) analyses by a homemade Li electrodeposition cell was used to detect the real-time evolution from primary Li nuclei to dendrites [88]. In situ NMR was also utilized to determine the structure of lithium dendrite. Clare P. Grey group [29] demonstrated the ability of in situ 6Li/7Li NMR to study the morphologies of deposited lithium metal quantitatively."

      "text" : "Lithium metal is highly reactive and thermodynamically unstable, which results in the formation of a passivation layer of SEI with thickness of several nanometers on its surface immediately when contact with liquid electrolyte in time constants of milliseconds. SEI consists of insoluble and partially soluble Li-ion conductive components with high electronic resistivity, which determines the overall performances of the batteries [22]. Upon repeatable Li electrodissolution/electrodeposition with large volume change, SEI layer is easy to crack with fresh Li metal exposure, leading to the inhomogeneities on the electrode surface where are more likely to concentrate Li-ion flux (“hot spots”) and the subsequent Li dendrite growth. Moreover, during long cycling, the uncontrolled formation of thick SEI results in the consumption of both the liquid electrolyte and lithium metal, which leads to low CE [158, 208]. It should be noted that the lithium metal is easy to be covered by a native film which consisted of Li2CO3, Li2O, and LiOH [93].\nFig. 5.9 Morphology observations on the Li nuclei and growth during Li electrochemical deposition/dissolution.

(Reproduced with permission-Copyright 2017, American Association for the Advancement of Science [111])\n5 High-Energy All-Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries by Nanomaterial Designs 229\nThe composition and structure of SEI is quite complex with a heterogeneous morphology that is dependent on the cations and anions, solvent molecules and impurities in the liquid electrolyte, as well as current density, temperature, and so on. The models on the SEI formation have been studied since 1979 by Paled [158, 159]. He predicted a mosaic structure SEI with Li2O, LiF, Li2CO3 and semicarbonates and polyolefins, as shown in Fig. 5.10a. Another SEI model predicted by Doron Aurbach is multilayer structure: inner region is thin and compact inorganic materials blocking the diffusion of solvent molecules or anions through it, and the outer region is more porous (Fig. 5.10b). The reduction products of both insoluble inorganic components reacted with salts (e.g., lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), lithium perchlorate (LiClO4)) and partially soluble semi-carbonates and polymers with solvents. ROLi, RCOOLi, and ROCOLi2 (R = alkyl groups) species were found for the commonly used solvents of ethers (e.g., 1, 2-dimethoxyethane (DME), tetrahydrofuran (THF), tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME)), esters (e.g., ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), propylene carbonate (PC)), and alkyl carbonate, respectively [11]. It has been proposed in 1997 that the artificial SEI layer consisted of LiF and Li2O on lithium metal surface was effective to stabilize lithium deposition/dissolution [188]. The use of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) solvent could provide a uniform Li metal deposition with high CE, which is due to the partial polymerization via an anionic mechanism and the formation of a more flexible SEI layer with the ability of accommodation the volume changes, as illustrated in Fig. 5.10b [12]. Very recently, Yi Cui group [111]discovered two different mechanisms by cryo-TEM (Fig. 5.10c), besides the observation of atomic image of beam-sensitive lithium metal. They found SEI in carbonate-based electrolyte consisted of small crystalline domains identified to be Li2O and Li2CO3 with diameter of 3 nm dispersed randomly in an amorphous organic polymer matrix formed by the decomposition of carbonate electrolyte. When adding 10 volume % fluoroethylene carbonate in the carbonate-based electrolyte, a multilayer structure with a more order arrangement was observed, different from Aurbach’s demonstration. The inner layer is an amorphous polymer matrix, and the outer is Li2O with large grain size of ~15 nm, without the trace of LiF that are generally believed the main composition of SEI.\nVariety of experiments has been carried out to investigate the structure and compositions of the SEI layer on Li metal upon Li deposition/dissolution cycling. XPS that is widely used to probe surface chemistry has been carried out to confirm that SEI formed on the graphite surface is multilayers composed of LiF and Li2CO3 close to electrode/SEI and a porous polymeric layer at SEI/electrolyte (Andersson et al. 2001). Kanamura et al. found based on XPS that the SEI layer on the surface of deposited lithium metal on Ni substrate consisted of LiF and Li2O under low current density of 0.2 mA cm 2 and a thick inner Li2O layer with an outer layer of LiOH, Li2CO3, or LiOCO2R under 10.0 mA cm\n2 [92]. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was also utilized to determine the SEI composition. Morigaki [150] found that the reduction products of lithium alkyl carbonates on lithium metal surface were observed by in situ FTIR. It is found by electrochemical impedance\n230 W. Liu\nspectroscopy (EIS) that the interfacial resistances corresponding to SEI and the charge diffusion at Li metal anode are much larger than that of electrolyte, which plays a key role on the Li deposition/dissolution cycling [22, 191]. After several cycles, the interfacial resistances decreased, which is because the reduction of the overpotentials with increased surface area of Li metal anode due to dendritic growth. However, the EIS data analysis using equivalent circuit sometimes is empirical and is not accurate.\nHence, the morphology, compositions, and electrochemical and thermal stability [46] of SEI are highly dependent on salt and solvent types. In addition, the behavior of SEI also has a strong dependence on the factors that influence lithium metal deposition/dissolution. Beside current density, temperature is also important. It is found that low temperature ( 20 C) could result in an improved cycling performance of lithium metal anode, due to the formation of compact and stable SEI of LiF with low resistance at low temperature that maintained at RT after subsequent cycling [83], while Andersson et al. found that LiOCO2R formed on graphite was not stable and decomposed at elevated temperature by XPS, which leaded to capacity decay during cycling. LiF on the surface was observed to break into crystallites upon increasing storage temperature, due to decomposition of salt in the electrolyte. And, the amount of polymeric carbon in SEI increased with time, which is because the continuous decomposition of the solvent [6].\nIt is undoubted that SEI plays a critical role on determining the electrochemical performances and safety of LMBs. Over the past two decades, since the first report on SEI formed on alkali and alkaline earth metals with electrolyte [157], various approaches have been proposed to introduce an ideal SEI layer with reasonable thickness of a few nanometers to block the diffusion of solvated electrons, that is, high cation conductivity with low electronic conductivity, good electrochemical stability, high mechanical strength and tolerance to the volume change during cycling, and a wide range of temperature."

      "text" : "With considerable effort on exploring novel materials, various SSEs with high ionic conductivities larger than 10 3 S cm 1 have been discovered, while less attention has been focused on the SSE/electrode interfaces. It should be noted that the fundamental behavior for lithium plating and dendrite growth through SSEs is different from liquid electrolytes. Two decades ago, Rishi Raj proposed a kinetic approach to understand the Li nucleation at cavities in grain boundaries with lower ionic conductivity than grains of SSEs [164, 165]. During the Li metal nucleation, two states are involved: a supersaturation of Li with an electro-chemo-mechanical potential μ Li and an embryo of Li metal formed at the grain boundary with the\n5 High-Energy All-Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries by Nanomaterial Designs 231\nFi g .5\n.1 0\n(c on\ntin ue d)\n232 W. Liu\nreference potential of pure lithium μ 0. The difference (Δμ Li ¼ μ Li μ 0) is the excess chemical potential that provides the driving force for the Li metal nucleation, which is against with the excess surface energy due to the embryo formation. Differentiating of ΔG with respect to radius and equating to zero could determine the critical radius rcwith the free energy barrier to nucleation. rc could be determined as follows:\nrc ¼ 2γnVΔμ Li (5:10)\nwhere nV is the number of Li atoms per unit volume. Hence, it can be seen that the diameter of Li nuclei is dependent on the surface energy, the density of Li atoms and the applied overpotential for Li electrochemical plating. When a current is applied on the solid-state battery, the voltage drops across the grains and the grain boundaries in SSE and the SEI layer at the interface. The voltage drop attributed to the grain boundary close to the interface with Li metal can provide an overpotential (ΔV ), that is, the driving force for nucleation of Li dendrites (State 1), as illustrated in Fig. 5.11. A flux of Li-ions equal to the applied current density ( j) then forms at the grain boundary due to the formation of a space charge layer. Li precipitates of embryos appear at the grain boundary of SSE by the expense of the supersaturation (State 2). The Li embryo created into the grain boundary produces a mechanical compression that must be overcome for continuous Li nucleation. The total driving force for the Li nucleation at the boundary could be expressed as follows:\nΔμ Li ¼ jρB δB 1 d0\nd\nej j σF\nnV (5:11)\nwhere d is grain size, ρB is resistivity of grain boundary, δB is effective boundary width, |e| is the positive charge of Li-ion, and σF is the fracture stress of SSE. Hence, if the driving force is lower than the energy barrier (combination Eqs. 5.10 and 5.11), the Li dendrite could be unlikely to form according to the following expression:\njρB δB 1 d0\nd\nej j 2γ rcnV þ σF nV\n(5:12)\nTherefore, from the above expression, it can be seen that the Li dendrite formation could be avoided in terms of (1) current density lower than critical current density, (2) grain boundary of SSE with high ionic conductivity, and (3) SSE with high fracture stress.\nFig. 5.10 Schematic presentation of four different surface chemistry distributions for the SEI layer on Li metal anode.

A protrusion on the surface of the Li metal surface can concentrate the local Li-ion flux and promote the growth of lithium dendrite. The current density near the tip of the protrusion is shown as follows according to the Saint-Venant’s principle:\njint ¼ j h\nw (5:13)\nwhere w and h are the width and the height of the bump tip on Li metal surface. Therefore, smooth Li metal surface takes the advantage of stable Li electrochemical deposition.\nIn general, the stiffness for SSEs with high elastic modulus is required to suppress Li dendrite growth. On the other hand, the volume change in anode and cathode associated with Li-ion transfer in and out during charge/discharge could damage the mechanical integrity of the electrodes as well as the electrode/electrolyte interface, which leads to the electrode cracks and delamination of SSE from electrodes. The\nconformal ability for SSEs to volume change during Li plating/stripping could avoid the detachment from electrodes and maintain a good contact with low interfacial resistance. It seems like that the high modulus for SSEs is more important than the flexibility, as predicted by Monroe and Newman [53, 149] that SSEs with at least twice shear modulus of Li metal (Li metal: ~3.4 GPa) are able to block Li dendrite growth. But, one requirement is needed for implementing this prediction is that the contact between the electrolyte and electrode must be tight [184]. Most SPEs and inorganic electrolytes have been proved to be penetrated by lithium dendrite growth [25, 44, 170]. Brissot et al. [25] found that for the symmetrical Li cells based on PEO electrolyte, like the cells using liquid electrolyte, Li dendrites started to grow at Sand’s time at high current density, when the ionic concentrations dropped to zero at the anode. However, at low current density, Li dendrites were also been observed attributed to the local inhomogeneities at the electrode surface, which is different from Chazalviel’s model [31]. In addition, Ce-Wen Nan group [167] reported that although LLZO has a high enough modulus of approximately 60 GPa, Li dendrite could penetrate it and cause short circuit under a medium current density of 0.5 mA cm 1, while, a soft passivating interface layer coated on SSEs or Li metal could prevent dendrite grow, as reported by some related literatures [63, 114]. The onset of Li infiltration depends on SSE surface morphology, in particular the defect size and density [160].\nAlthough the solid/solid interface is not as dynamic as the liquid/solid interface, it contributes to the major voltage drop compared to the resistance of SSE in the battery, which plays a critical role in degrading electrochemical performance of ASSLBs [26]. The ion transport over the interface is more rate-determining than that in bulk for a battery, which is the major bottleneck for practical application of ASSLBs [235]. Most of SSEs are not thermodynamically stable species with limited voltage window against Li metal anode and high-voltage cathode. A SEI layer with a mixed ionic-electronic conductivity can allow for continuous flow of Li-ions and electrons through the mixed conducting interphase (MCI), leading to the complete lithiation of the electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 5.12a [210]. Hence, a kinetically stabilized ion-conducting SEI layer without electronic conduction is required for stable Li deposition/dissolution cycling. It could be seen from Fig. 5.12b, c that the formation of interface layer at the Li|SSE and SSE|cathode interfaces increases the impedances largely and this subsequently leads to potential drops, which limit the electrochemical performance of the batteries, especially the power density. The interfacial impedances attributed to space charge layer, electrochemical side reaction, mechanical incompatibility, and so on [168, 218]. The space charge layer with a thickness of around 10 nm at SSE|cathode interface is associated with the formation of Li-ion deficient region due to the different bonding ability that reduces ion conductivity. A Li-reduced decomposition layer could be formed at the Li|SSE interface. It revealed that SPEs could be react with Li metal, forming a passivation layer, according to the time evolution of interfacial resistance in symmetric Li [41]. For inorganic electrolytes, Gerbrand Ceder group [168] and Yifei Mo group [72, 252] have predicted by computational methodology the electrochemical stability\n5 High-Energy All-Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries by Nanomaterial Designs 235\nwindow of the most studied inorganic SSEs (Fig. 5.12d), which is also supported by experiment results. The ion-conducting SEI layer formed on the electrode surface due to the electrochemical instability increases interfacial resistance. The interfacial resistance that impedes ion conduction is also as a result of the chemical mixing due to the interdiffusion of Li-ions through the interfaces.\nMoreover, the mechanical instability, due to the large volume change of electrode during lithiation/delithiation processes, is also one of the most challenging issues to be solved, which leads to the loss of contact between the electrolyte and electrode and degrades the cycling performance. In this review, the stability of Li|SSE interface and the approaches to suppress dendrite growth will be discussed in the following session.\nVarious experiments have been carried to confirm the instability of SSEs with metallic Li, including XPS [76, 175, 211], NMR [235], SEM [2, 222], TEM [138], EIS, etc. Even LiPON that is recognized as one of the most stable SSEs was found to be reacted with lithium metal [233]. It is found the decomposition chemicals consisted of Li3PO4, Li3P, and Li3N by a highly surface-sensitive XPS [175]. It is generally recognized that LGPS could react with lithium metal due to the chemical instability of Ge4+, leading to an interphase layer formed at the interface. It is found that by in situ XPS (Fig. 5.13a), the new chemical species, such as Li2S, LisP, and Li15Ge4 alloy (or Ge), were formed due to the decomposition of LGPS at the interface according to the following equation:\nLi10GeP2S12 þ 23:75Li ! 12Li2Sþ 2Li3Pþ 1=4Li15Ge4 (5:14) The interfacial resistance associated with the resultant chemicals was also measured by time-resolved EIS. As shown in Fig. 5.13b, c, the interfacial impedance increased with time was found, due to the poor conductive decompositions of LGPS when in contact with Li metal anode. The thickness of the SEI layer was deduced to be ~20 nm after 30 h, by assuming the main component was Li2S with a low ionic conductivity of 8 10 9 S cm 1. It also could calculate that the SEI thickness was about 370 nm for LGPS and 23 nm for Li7P3S11 after 1 year, which is corresponding to an interfacial resistance of 4.6 and 0.28 kΩ cm2, respectively [211]. It was believed that LPS with the highest ionic conductivity for SSEs to date was stable against Li metal [77], but later it is found by in situ XPS technique that LPS could react with Li metal with the decomposed interphase layer consisted of Li2S and Li3P [212].\nDirect morphology observation visually on the formation of interphase species when SSE contacts with Li metal is clearer on the mechanism understanding. Miaofang Chi group [138] an in situ aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to detect the morphology change at the interface when cubic LLZO contacting with Li metal, as exhibited in Fig. 5.13d, e. They revealed that the surface of cubic LLZO was reduced to a tetragonal-like LLZO interphase layer of around five unit cells with a thickness of 6 nm by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and this SEI layer was stable over time to prevent the further reaction of LLZO with Li metal. Moreover, the NASICON-type inorganic electrolytes, such as LAGP or LATP, have also been confirmed to react with Li metal leading to the generation of aMCI layer [76]. It also has been proven that the perovskite-type LLTO could be reduced by lithium insertion to produce reduced Ti-ions and Ti metal due to the reduction of Li metal, based on the ex situ XPS results [83, 210, 230].\nTo detect the morphology or the phase using a microscope or spectroscopy technology, the applied beam irradiation may cause damage on the samples,\n5 High-Energy All-Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries by Nanomaterial Designs 237\nespecially beam-sensitive species, which could lead to an error or misunderstanding on the results [121]. Xiangxin Guo group [222] found that metallic lithium could be expulsed on the surface of garnet-based ceramic electrolyte under the beam irradiation by SEM, due to the injection of electrons into the garnet. Hence, this behavior needs to be considered when using SEM or TEM to probe garnet oxides."

However, in the late 1980s, it was reported by Scrosati that PEO itself couldn’t block dendrite growth [176, 228]. Jean-Marie Tarascon group [44] found that without any external force, the SPE membrane could be easily pushed up by lithium dendrite growth, which leads to the delamination of SPE from Li metal anode. An early work on ASSLIB was reported by the pioneers Zaghib, Armand, and Gauthier, which demonstrates that the ASSLIB using solvent-free PEO-based electrolyte, graphite, or Li4Ti5O12 anode coupled with LCO cathode delivered charge-discharge curves only for several cycling [237]. Hence, various strategies have been proposed to improve the interface stability of SPEs against Li metal anode toward practical applications, including electrolyte additives, cross-linked polymer networks, polymer blends, block copolymer electrolytes, and hyperbranched polymer."

Zhang and Armand group [50] reported PEO-based CPEs with lithium azide (LiN3) (2 wt.%) for all-solid-state Li-S batteries (ASSLSBs), showing a polarization voltage as low as 5 mV for the Li symmetric cells at the current density of 0.1 mA cm 2 at 70 C. The improved stability with Li metal is due to the formation of a thin and compact SEI layer with highly ionic conductivity passivation layer on Li metal anode, which could prevent dendrite formation as well as polysulfide shuttling. ASSLSBs using PEO-based CPEs with LiN3 showed a high discharge capacity of 800 mAh g\n1 after 30 cycles at 70 C. The promising inorganic electrolyte LLZO has been widely studied as fillers in SPEs. Ce-Wen Nan and Yang Shen group [244] reported PVDF-based composite electrolytes with Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (LLZTO) ceramics, showing a high ionic conductivity of about 5 10 4 S cm 1 at RT due to the acid-base interaction of LLZTO nanoparticles with the N atom and C═O group of polymer and solvent molecules. The LCO|CPE|Li cell delivered a specific capacity of 147 mAh g 1 at 0.4 C after 120 cycles with a high-capacity retention of 98%. The addition of LLZTO in the Li symmetric cells showed an improved cycling stability at 25 C under various current densities. Candace K. Chan group [231] confirmed the ability of incorporation of inorganic ceramic to improve ionic conductivity and Li dendrite resistance, by the study of cubic-phase LLZO NW-filled PAN-LiClO4 CPE, which showed prolonged time of short circuit for the Li symmetric cells. Liangbin Hu group [57] demonstrated a PEO-based CPE with 3D Li-ion conducting network made of LLZO nanowires, showing a stable Li plating/stripping under the current density of 0.2 mA cm 2 for 500 h and 0.5 mA cm cm 2 over 300 h.\n5 High-Energy All-Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries by Nanomaterial Designs 239"

Although SPEs are flexible relatively, the contact with Li metal anode gets worse with cycling due to the poor wettability and the large volume change upon Li platting/stripping. Hence, introducing an interphase layer with strong adhesion with Li metal at the interface is promising. Yi Cui group [128] developed a 3D composite Li metal anode with a flowable interfacial layer (Fig. 5.14), guaranteeing a good adhesion with the solid electrolyte during cycling by reducing the interfacial fluctuation to local scale. For the composite 3D Li metal anode without volume change, Li metal was fused into the pores of layered reduced graphene oxide (rGO) host, and PEG with a molecular weight of 10,000 showing a viscous semiliquid state was then infiltrated into the 3D composite Li metal anode, so that the resultant flowable interphase could improve the adhesion of the electrolyte with Li metal anode.

With reduced crystallinity, PEO were cross-linked with poly(ethyleneglycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and divinylbenzene (DVB) prepared by UV-induced photopolymerization. The cross-linked SPEs showed a high voltage window of 4.3 V and an ionic conductivity of 1.4 10 4 S cm 1 at 70 C.

In addition, for ASSLSB, the specific discharge capacity decreased from 375 to 175 mAh g 1 after 50 cycles [19]. Lynden A. Archer group [37] developed CPEs with hairy NPs as cross-linkers. But to improve ionic conductivity, the cross-linked polymer electrolytes are not totally dry, which is gel polymer electrolytes with mechanical modulus of 1 MPa and ionic conductivity of 10 5 S cm 1.

The ratio of hard non-conductive to soft conductive component is critical to the mechanical strength and ionic conductivity. However, the shear moduli of SPEs are complex, with in-phase and out-of-phase components strongly depending on temperature and frequency, which is less understood fundamentally [73], ZnO [133], Al [58], and amorphous Si. Schauser et al. [172] studied the dendrite growth based on PS-block-PEO solid electrolytes by X-ray microtomography at the temperature range of 90–120 C. They found the lithium dendrite location changed from within the lithium metal anode to the electrolyte, which is because the shear modulus decreased significantly with temperature in the low-frequency regime.\nIt is recognized that in SPEs the anion concentration gradients can limit the power density of LIBs [43]. Later, the Li|P(STFSILi)-PEO-P(STFSILi)|LFP cells based on a single-ion polymer electrolyte showed a specific capacity of 138 mAh g 1 at 2C at\n5 High-Energy All-Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries by Nanomaterial Designs 241\n80 C. The cyclability at 60 C with more than 50 stable cycles is particularly noticeable. Capacity retention of >85% at 0.5 C at the temperature range of 60–80 C was achieved in solvent-free polymer-based LIBs [24]. However, SPEs based on nanostructured lamellar block copolymer show solid-like behavior in the bulk, as a result of a randomly oriented granular structure. The requirement of high shear modulus of at least 6 GPa for SSEs as Monroe and Newman suggested is inconsistent with the need of electrolyte like a chewing gum resulting in the good contact between electrolyte and electrode. Stone et al. [184] show a self-assembled lamellar block copolymer with a perpendicular orientation showing a liquid crystalline symmetry, which satisfied the conflicting requirements of high modulus and good interfacial adhesion at the interface. It also found the improved prevention to Li dendrite formation as well as the ability of strong interface contact."

      "text" : "Compared with SPEs, inorganic electrolytes usually possess almost unity LTN, resulting in a low concentration polarization with a possibility of high power density [252]. However, as discussed above, the electrochemical and chemical instability of inorganic electrolytes with Li metal, narrow voltage window, and the poor interface contact lead to high interfacial resistances and limit the practical application of inorganic SSEs in ASSLBs [168]. Even the garnet LLZO-based oxides that is recognized as one of the most stable SSEs were found to be reacted with Li metal [167]. The instability of garnet electrolytes with Li metal was revealed by in situ STEM. It was found that a tetragonallike LLZO interface layer with about five unit cell thickness was formed after the cubic LLZO contacted with Li metal. The SEI layer was able to prevent further reaction between the cubic LLZO and Li metal [138]. Additionally, although SSEs have enough high modulus to suppress Li dendrite as Monroe and Newman suggested, it was found by experiments that even inorganic ceramic couldn’t block the growth of lithium dendrite at the interface [160]. Both experimental and calculated results indicated that LLZO are highly stiff with shear moduli of about 60 GPa [234]. However, Ishiguro and co-workers [84] found that the Li symmetrical cells based on garget electrolyte showed a short-circuit time of 280 s at a slightly high current density of 0.5 mA cm 2. Li deposition is stable without short circuit under the current densities lower than 0.1 mA cm 2. Yet-Ming Chiang group [160] conducted rationally designed experiments to monitor Li metal penetration into inorganic electrolytes, including Li2S-P2S5, β-Li3PS4, polycrystalline, and single-crystalline garnet-based oxide. They found a different mechanism of Li dendrite growth during Li electrochemical deposition for SSEs from the amplification of kinetic variation at the Li metal surface for liquid electrolyte, which is strongly dependent on the surface morphology of SSEs. It was believed that Li metal plating was started from Li metal surface (Fig. 5.15a) and grew to fill the space between Li metal and SSE, especially the pre-existing flaws (i.e., cracks, voids, pinholes) or wetting incompatibility on SSE where the localized current\n242 W. Liu\nconcentrated. The deposited Li metal then grows to drive crack propagation and penetrates through grain boundaries and interconnected pores of the ceramic electrolyte, leading to the electromechanical failure of the electrolyte (Fig. 5.15b). In addition, it is demonstrated that isolated Li metal agglomerates could be found in the inorganic solid electrolyte, which is due to Li-ion reduction by electrons from the oxygen backbone of the LLZO-based electrolyte (Fig. 5.15c) or from the residual electronic conductivity (Fig. 5.15d). The above behavior was also supported by Aguesse and co-workers [2]. Figure 5.15e showed the photo of the LLZO-based ceramic penetrated by Li dendrite. The SEM image of Fig. 5.15f shows the surface morphology of the LLZObased electrolyte facing Li metal, and the SEM images in Fig. 5.14g, h indicate that the Li metal corresponding to the dark precipitates filled in the pores of electrolyte. Furthermore, the interfacial instability becomes more critical by repeatable Li plating/ stripping cycles, especially for a larger amount of Li metal. Hence, to prevent Li dendrite growth in ASSLMBs, scientists have raised various approaches, including electrolyte additives, artificial SEI layer, nanoscale interfacial engineering, microstructure modifications and high pressure, etc."

The composite electrolyte showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.0 10 4 S cm 1, a wide electrochemical window up to 5.2 V, and a good stability with Li metal anode. The Li/LCO and Li/LFP cells based on the composite electrolyte demonstrated discharge-specific capacities of 130 and 140 mAh g 1 at 0.1 C at first cycle and decreased to 33 and 37 mAh g 1 when rising the current rate to 0.8 C, respectively. The Li/LCO and Li/LFP cells achieved a high-capacity retention of 97% after 150 cycles at 0.1 C and delivered energy densities of 196.9 Wh kg 1 and 377.0 Wh L 1 and 151.3 Wh kg 1 and 304.1 Wh L 1.\nBy addition of Li3PO4 into LLZO-based oxide electrolyte, a self-limiting ion-conductive SEI layer of Li3P was formed due to the reaction of Li3PO4 with Li metal, which results in the interfacial resistance from 2080 to 1008 Ω cm 2 and then to 454 Ω cm 2 after stable cycling for 60 h for the Li symmetric cells [227]. LiF is one of the most stable Li compounds with Li metal with large voltage window, which is introduced into stable garnet oxide to improve its stability in moisture air. The LLZO-based electrolyte with 2 wt.% LiF indicated less Li2CO3 on the surface, showing smaller interfacial impedances compared with the one without LiF. The Li/LFP cells based on the modified electrolyte with an extra polymer coating facing Li metal showed discharge capacities of 142 mAh g 1 at 80 mA cm 2 at 65 C for the first cycle and maintained 120 mAh g 1 after 100 cycles with high CE of 99.8–100%.

Liangbin Hu group proposed an approach of coating “lithiophilic” layer by in situ reaction with Li metal (Fig. 5.16a), including Al2O3 [73], ZnO [133], Al [58, 59], and amorphous Si [137] to form a stable artificial SEI layer at the interface of garnet electrolytes with Li metal anode, which could decrease interfacial resistance. The introduction of Al2O3 layer with several nanometer thickness lithiated by Li metal dramatically decreased the interfacial impedance from 1710 to 1 Ω cm 2 at RT (Fig. 5.16b), due to the resultant conformal garnet/Li interface. The lithiated layer could also prevent the further reaction of LLZO with Li metal. The Li symmetrical cells using Al2O3-coated garnet electrolyte delivered a stable cycling with a polarization voltage of 22 mV under the current density of 0.2 mAcm 2 for 30 min (Fig. 5.16c) [73]. Another approach to improve the contact of LLZO with Li metal to remove the surface contaminants (Li2CO3 and LiOH) that are formed in the moisture air [34, 179, 180]. Sharafi et al. [179] demonstrated that the interfacial resistance was reduced to only 2 Ω cm 2, due to the good wettability of clean LLZO with Li metal. The Li symmetrical cells could run at 0.2 mA cm 2 for 100 cycles stably.\nIn addition to introducing a stable artificial SEI layer via an extra interphase layer or mixing with other components, an interfacial layer in situ formed between the solid electrolytes with Li metal is cost-effective. Goodenough group [110] developed an inorganic electrolyte LiZr2(PO4)3 with a high ionic conductivity of 2 10 4 S cm 1 at RT and good electrochemical voltage window up to 5.5 V vs. Li+/Li. A Li-ion conducting SEI layer as a strong adhesion was formed at the interface between this electrolyte and Li metal, which is consisted of Li3P and Li8ZrO6. The ASS Li/LFP cells showed a specific capacity of 140 and 120 mAh g 1 at the current density of 50 and 100 μA cm 2, respectively. For sulfide electrolytes that are not stable with Li metal, an interphase layer was introduced to stable the Li deposition/dissolution cycling. Au was proposed effectively to prevent the reaction between Li2S-P2S5 solid electrolyte and Li metal due to the alloy formation with Li metal and the good compatibility with sulfide electrolyte [95]."

But the common used electrical conducting component such as carbon black is oxidized during heating at high temperatures, so that an inorganic conducting alternative of In2O5Sn (ITO) shows advantage. Ce-Wen Nan group [124] demonstrated an ASSLB based on LLZO electrolyte. The\n5 High-Energy All-Solid-State Lithium-Metal Batteries by Nanomaterial Designs 245\ncomposite LCO cathode consisted of LCO, LTO, and Li3BO3 (LBO) that is a solid Li-ion conductor with low melting temperature of 700 C. The electrolyte and composite electrode were co-fired at 700 C. The resultant battery showed a specific discharge capacity of 101.3 mAh g 1 at the first cycle at 0.025 C at RT. Recently, Xiangxin Guo and ChunshengWang et al. [74] demonstrated an all-ceramic lithium battery with a very low interfacial resistance by interphase engineering, which is attributed to thermal soldering the LLZO electrolyte and the LCO cathode with Li2.3 xC0.7+xB0.3 xO3 SEI via the reaction of Li2.3C0.7B0.3O3 solder with their conformally Li2CO3 coating (Fig. 5.17). Li2CO3 is also able to prevent the element diffusion at high temperature. The Li/LLZO/LCO ASSLIBs delivered a high specific capacity of 83 mAh g 1 after 100 cycles at RT, and good rate capability, which is the best performance for all-ceramic Li batteries to date. In addition to the inorganic interphase layer, polymer was also proposed to improve the contact between the garnet-based electrolyte and electrode and suppress Li dendrite growth. An asymmetric SSE consisted of LLZO covered with polymer electrolyte of 7.5 nm thickness was able to prevent Li dendrite growth [45].\nSulfide electrolytes such as LGPS, with extremely high ionic conductivities, process poor compatibility with metallic lithium, showing a limited application in ASSLMBs. A lithium compatible interphase layer of 75%Li2S-24%P2S5–1%P2O5 was adopted to prevent the contact of LGPSwith Li metal anode in ASSLSBs [232]. To further improve the electrochemical performance through reducing the interfacial resistance and the strain of sulfur cathode, a composite sulfur cathode was synthesized by coating sulfur\nwith thickness of ~ 2 nm onto rGO. This composite cathode was then coated on the LGPS side of the bilayer sulfide electrolyte. The resultant ASSLSBs showed a high discharge-specific capacity of 1629 mA h g 1 at 60 C at 0.05 C for the first cycle, and a specific capacity of 830mA g 1 at 1.0 C after 750 cycles, indicating a good long cycling performance.\nIn addition to the stable inorganic interface layer, polymer-based layers have also been proposed to improve the contact between the inorganic electrolyte and metallic Li anode. A gel electrolyte was used to protect the garnet-based electrolyte and improve the wettability. The interfacial resistance reduced from 6.5 104 to 248 Ω cm 2 and from 1.4 104 to 214Ω cm 2 for the interface with cathode and Li metal anode, respectively. The Li/LFP cell based on the gel electrolyte coated with solid electrolyte showed a high specific capacity of 140 mAh g 1 after 70 cycles at RT [127]. John B. Goodenough group [251] demonstrated a polymer/ceramic/polymer sandwich structured composite solid electrolytes for ASSLIBs. The multilayer electrolyte consisted of a LATP ceramic\nelectrolyte sandwiched between two cross-linked SPE membranes, showing a reduced double-layer electric field near Li metal anode, due to the block of ceramic layer with unit LTN. The polymer/ceramic/polymer sandwich electrolyte was able to prevent Li dendrite growth, attributed to the homogenous Li-ion flux distribution at the polymer/ lithium interface and the good wettability of polymer. The results showed that the Li/LFP cells based on the sandwich electrolyte could deliver a discharge capacity of 102 mAh g 1 at 0.6 C after 640 cycles, better than the one without ceramic layer of 70 mAh g 1 after 325 cycles at 65 C."

It is found that the interfacial impedance decreased from 130 to 37 Ω cm 2 by reducing the grain size from 100–200 to 20–40 μm, resulting in a more stable cycling performance, which is due to the larger amount of grain boundaries at surface.

However, many scientists and engineers have devoted their efforts on the development of SSEs toward the practical applications of ASS batteries since the middle of the twentieth century, even though only hightemperature Na-S batteries based on SSEs are viable. But it can be prospected that although liquid electrolyte is promising for near-term applications for LIBs, SSE as\n248 W. Liu\nan alternative is of great interest in long-term technologies for post-LIBs. Meanwhile, to adopt the ideal anode material of lithium metal in the batteries coupled with high-capacity chemistries such sulfur and oxygen, SSEs with high elastic moduli are of great promise to suppress Li dendrite growth and subsequently improve safety.\nSSEs with high ionic conductivities (>10 3 S cm 1 at RT), comparable to that of liquid electrolyte, have been discovered continuously. Sulfide electrolytes (e.g., Li10GeP2S12 and Li7P3S11) and garnet oxides (e.g., Li6.25Ga0.25La3Zr2O12) could achieve ionic conductivities of higher than 10 3 S cm 1 at RT, but both are sensitive to moisture in air and unstable with Li metal anode. The large interfacial impedances, derived from the chemical and electrochemical instability, poor incompatibility, and physical contact of SSEs with electrodes, remain the critical issues to limit the commercialization of SSEs as well as lithium metal anode in ASSLMBs. The Li-reduced decomposition layer formed at the Li|SSE interface is highly resistive, which especially restricts the rate capability of the batteries, while, in principle, inorganic electrolytes and single-ion SPEs with near unit LTN show great potential to achieve high power density. Advanced image- and spectrum-based techniques have been adopted to understand the behavior of lithium nucleation and dendrite growth at the interface of SSE and Li metal anode during Li deposition/dissolution cycling. Moreover, various approaches have proposed to improve the stability of SSEs including organic polymers and inorganic electrolytes with Li metal, which are highlighted in detail in this chapter. Introducing a stable artificial SEI layer with ionically conducting and electronically insulating at the Li|SSE interface is a promising approach. In addition, a good conformal contacting for SSEs with Li metal critically benefits for stable cycling, due to the infinite volume change for Li metal anode over repeated charge/discharge cycles. Hence, the structure of a composite lithium metal anode which consisted of a lithiophilic and ionic conductive porous host filled with Li metal, connected tightly with a thin SSE layer of high ionic conductivity, is of great promise for high-performance ASSLMBs. Although the current electronic devices and EVs are powered by LIBs exclusively based on liquid electrolyte and graphite, and there is a long way to go for scientists and engineers before the widely practical applications, ASSLMBs will increase the chance of a full commercialization of the next-generation large-scaled energy storages with high energy and power density, long cycling life, high safety, and durability.\nAcknowledgments The author thanks Dr. Qing Lu for the analysis on the related publications and Jingbo Louise Liu and Dr. Sajid (Bashir) Liu for the invitation."

Under this circumstance, the innovation of anode materials is expected to be a promising way to remarkably increase the capacity of lithium-ion batteries. Metalbased chalcogenide (MXs, M = Sn, Mo, Fe, or Ge; X = O, S or Se) is a promising material for the anode of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), because of their higher theoretical capacity when compared to conventional carbonaceous anodes. However, the wide application of chalcogenide anode in rechargeable battery is still hindered by the low efficiency and poor cycle performance caused by a large volume change during fully discharge and charge. Recently, there has been much interest in using nanostructured and carbon composite method in lithium-ion batteries to alleviate their inherent drawback. This chapter will provide an overview of the chalcogenide anode materials which are being studied experimentally in order to develop nextgeneration anodes for high-performance lithium-ion batteries."

      "text" : "In the last two decades, electrical energy storage (EES) has witnessed unprecedented boom among which lithium-ion batteries are the most popular energy storage devices, powering portable electronics and electronic vehicles due to their high energy density. A great variety of cathode materials have been synthesized, and these materials can meet the needs of high capacity demand in many fields. However, research on high-performance anode materials still remains a big challenge. Historically speaking, graphite was the first type of carbon with which reversible lithiation was explored. It was found to be a good basis for the anodic reaction in rechargeable lithium (Li) batteries and then also plays a detrimental role in the commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [1]. Even though graphite has almost a perfectly layered structure, which is able to intercalate a large amount of Li, forming lithium carbide (LixC6), where 0 < x < 1, it exhibits a capacity of 372 mAh/g [2]. In order to further improve the energy density for lithium-ion batteries, massive efforts have been made to find alternative anode materials.\nAnode material for lithium-ion batteries should [3]:"

      "text" : "These early studies suggested that Li intermetallics with various metals such as silicon (Si), tin (Sn), aluminum (Al), antimony (Sb), germanium (Ge), lead (Pb), bismuth (Bi), and magnesium (Mg) showed high gravimetric capacity [4–11]. But in\n264 Q. Tang et al.\nthe meantime, they also exhibit an obvious drawback that there is a large inherent increase in volume during lithiation in these alloy-based anodes. The volume expansion causes pulverization issue and aggregation of alloy-based materials which leads to the poor cycle life. Table 6.1 shows the comparison of performance between different element anode materials which can form an alloy with lithium.\nIdota et al. pointed out an amorphous metal-oxide material that can store Li ions with a Coulombic capacity reaching that of hydrogen-storage alloys, ensuring protection against dendritic Li formation. The amorphous material is a metal composite oxide glass that contains tin (II) oxide (SnO) as an active center for Li adsorption [12]. The achievement is later recognized to be attributed to the application of metal composites in lithium-ion batteries. Compared with the pure metal materials, the metal chalcogenides (MXs, M= Sn, molybdenum (Mo), iron (Fe), Ge, nickel (Ni), Sb, or cobalt (Co); X = oxygen (O), sulfur (S), or selenium (Se)) have become a hot spot for anode materials in lithium-ion batteries due to their merits of mechanical, thermal, and structural stability. Generally speaking, the metal chalcogenide anode materials can be classified into two types in terms of their different structure [13, 14]:\n1. Layered MXs, mainly including M sulfides or selenides such as SnS2 SnSe2, SnSeS, SnSe0.5S0.5, MoSe2, GeS, MoS2, tungsten sulfide (WS2), etc., show an excellent ability to lithiation. According to the report by Ataca et al., singlelayered MXs even display an interesting conductivity. 2. Nonlayered MXs, primarily containing FeS, FeS2 FeSe2, CoS2, CoSe2, NiS2, Sb2S3, Bi2S3, etc. Many can be obtained from natural minerals, such as chalcopyrite, pyrite, marcasite, and sphalerite. Thus, the advantages of low price and high theoretical capacity make them very competitive compared to other anode materials.\nIn spite of MXs is expected to be a promising anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, it is gradually found that there is a poor cycling performance caused by relative volume change during lithiation and delithiation. After deep characterization, the mechanism of electrochemical reaction between lithium-ion and MX is\n6 Metal-Based Chalcogenide Anode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries 265\nconfirmed, as shown in Eqs. 6.1 and 6.2. Take SnO2, for example, where lithiation takes place in two steps [12]:\nSnO2 þ 4Liþ þ 4e ! 2Li2Oþ Sn irreversible reactionð Þ (6:1) xe þ xLiþ þ Sn ! LixSn during continuous cyclingð Þ (6:2)\nDue to the first step of the electrochemical reaction, MXs shows the relatively low Coulombic efficiency owing to the irreversible formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) films, lithium oxides, or sulfides (Li2O, Li2S, or Li2S). In the second step reaction, the alloying process, the active material suffers the volume change, which will lead to a lower performance. Two approaches have been taken to solve these problems: firstly, minimizing the particle size of active materials into nanoscale could degrade the mechanical strain, so the structural integrity can be maintained during the processing of alloying and de-alloying reaction with Li-ions, and also nanoscale materials guarantee a short transport path for lithium-ions to enhance electrochemical performance [15–17]; secondly, composite materials, combining MXs with other conductive frame (such as carbon materials and conductive polymer), in which an electrochemically active phase is homogeneously dispersed within in the conductive frame. This kind of composite material can not only buffer the volume expansion during the cycling but also prevent nanoparticle aggregation and enhance the electronic conductivity [18–21].\nIn this chapter, research on metal chalcogenide anode materials is summarized following the line of tin-based chalcogenides, molybdenum-based chalcogenides, iron-based chalcogenides, and germanium-based chalcogenides."

      "text" : "Tin (Sn) is a promising lithium-ion battery anode material, possessing high theory charge storage capacity both by weight and by volume (with the gravimetric specific capacity of 992 mAh/g and the volume specific capacity of 9765 mAh/cm3), which is more than two times that of commercial graphite materials employed for most commercial lithium-ion battery anodes. It is also inexpensive (roughly 20 $US/kg), relatively safe (not extremely pyrophoric), nontoxic, and highly abundant. It should be noted that pure tin is hardly used alone as an anode in lithium-ion batteries, but its composite form, Li2X (X = O, S or Se), constrains the volume expansion and contraction of Sn during cycling [22]."

      "text" : "Tin (ns2 np2) oxides, mainly as SnO and SnO2, are promising materials as the anode of lithium secondary batteries, because of its relevant higher theoretical capacity than the conventional carbonaceous anodes. In 1995, Idota et al. reported a kind of\n266 Q. Tang et al.\namorphous tin-based composite oxides (TCO) as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries [12]. The new Li storage mechanism attracts great attention. However, their wide application is still hampered by the severe capacity decay resulting from the irreversible formation of SEI films and the particle aggregation and pulverization caused by the huge volume changes during discharge/charge processes, as shown in Fig. 6.1 [23].\nFigure 6.1 shows the key issue of SnO2 (as well as SnS2 or SnSe2) as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Combining with Eqs. 6.1 and 6.2, in the first lithiation procedure, SnO2 was reduced to Sn, and the matrix of Sn and Li2O was coated with the SEI film that as the result of the electrolyte decomposition at around 0.8 V. The SEI film is an insulator for electrons, but a good conductor for lithiumions, which can freely insert and de-insert through this passivation film. In the main, SEI film determines the reversibility of the cell chemistry and hence cycle life of the device. In a lithium-ion battery that employs intercalation hosts as cathode and anode, Li+ is a limited source, and any loss of Li+ is at the expense of capacity and energy density of the device. The formation chemistry of SEI leads to consumption of Li+, which are converted into lithium salts insoluble in electrolyte solutions and hence “electrochemically inactive” [24]. Tin expands volumetrically by up to 260% on the full lithiation, creating two critical issues: the unstable and thick SEI films and the pulverization of active materials. As shown in Fig. 6.1a, the huge volume change of Sn particles during lithiation/delithiation cycles can cause the unstable SEI films on their surface, resulting in the continued formation of SEI films and depleting electrolyte. The large volume expansion may lead to huge stress and result in the pulverization and exfoliation of active materials, as shown in Fig. 6.1b. Thus, a wave of research has been done in order to solve or relieve these issues.\nIt was observed in [25] that the diameter of SnO2 is the key factor to determine electrochemical performance. In different reaction condition, respectively, at 110 C, 150 C, and 200 C, SnO2 nanoparticles with the size of 3.0 nm, 4.0 nm, and 8.0 nm can be obtained, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6.2, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was\n6 Metal-Based Chalcogenide Anode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries 267\nused to evaluate the structural and particle size differences between the samples obtained in different reaction condition. The electrochemical results showed that SnO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of about 3 nm have a superior capacity and cycling stability as compared to those measuring 4 or 8 nm because the higher surface area and smaller dimensions allow the host to accommodate the lithium-ion quickly with minimal internal strain. Other nanostructured tin-oxide anodes such as SnO2 nanowires also show higher initial Coulombic efficiency and an improved cyclic retention compared with those of SnO2 powder, as shown in Fig. 6.3 [26].\nGraphene (space group P6/mmm) is a two-dimensional aromatic monolayer of carbon atoms. It has excellent conductivity, the large specific surface area of over 2600 m2/g, high flexibility, and pronounced chemical stability, and so on which can be coated to encapsulate of active nanomaterials owing to SnO2-graphene composites had been prepared by different methods to improve electrochemical properties. For example, to optimize the cycling stability of tin-based anode materials, Mai et al. [27] have successfully synthesized the SnO2 quantum dots @ graphene oxide (denoted as SnO2-QDs@GO) with good dispersion and high mass loading, as shown in Fig. 6.4a1. The SnO2-QDs@GO exhibits promising performance as an anode for lithium-ion batteries in terms of high capacity (a capacity of 1121 mAh/g at a current density of\n0.1 A/g) and outstanding high-rate cycling stability, as shown in Fig. 6.4a2–a4. These results demonstrate this kind of unique design is a successful combination of high conductive graphene sheets and ultrafine quantum dots. This structure can provide a lot of active sites for lithium-ion, which in return provides high lithium storage capacity. Meanwhile, the voids between each quantum dot are able to provide space for the volume variation for lithium intercalation/de-intercalation and inhibit the aggregation of each particle. Moreover, the conductive graphene sheet endows each quantum dot with sufficient electrical conductivity, and the quantum dots offer shortened lithium diffusion length, which results in the enhanced kinetics, and, thus, high-rate cycling stability is achieved. Geng et al. [28] reported an in situ synthesized three-dimensional porous composite of fluorine tin oxides (F-SnO2) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) [F-SnO2@RGO] through a one-step hydrothermal method using a F-containing Sn source, as shown in Fig. 6.4b1, b2. In the composite material, F doping results in stronger interactions between F-SnO2 and RGO sheets, leading to more uniform and higher loading of F-SnO2 nanoparticles on RGO sheets. As a result, the LIB cells prepared by using the F-SnO2@RGO composite as anode material exhibited a specific\nFi g .6\n.4 (c on\ntin ue d)\n270 Q. Tang et al.\ncapacity of 1277 mAh/ g after 100 cycles. In addition, the F-SnO2@RGO electrode also displayed remarkable performance such as long-term cycling stability and excellent rate capacity at high charge/discharge current densities, as shown in Fig. 6.4b3–b6."

The adjacent sulfur layers are bound by weak van der Waals interactions (Fig. 6.5a). The structure of SnS is orthorhombic with the space group Pnma (n862). Tin sulfide (SnS) can be described as a deformed sodium chloride (NaCl) lattice, where Sn and S atoms form layers stacked along the a-axis (Fig. 6.5b). Within the layers, each Sn atom is bonded to three nearest S atoms at 2.63 Å and 2 2.67 Å and two more distant S atoms at 3.28 Å. Thus, the appropriate layered structure with swelling tolerant hosting spaces and enhanced guest accessibility would provide enhanced diffusion for Li-ions and lead to the formation of Li-Sn alloy during the cycling and improve the cycling stability of electrode.\nThis is generally ascribed to the electrochemical reaction mechanism between SnS2 and lithium-ions, which can be expressed as the following two steps: [30].\nSnS2 þ 4Liþ þ 4e ! Snþ 2Li2S (6:3)\nSnþ xLiþ þ xe ! LixSn 0 x 4:4ð Þ (6:4) As is shown by reaction (6.3), active metallic Sn is formed and embedded into the inert lithium sulfide (Li2S) matrix during the initial discharge process. It is believed that Li2S can help to buffer the mechanical stress from the electrode materials during subsequent lithiation/delithiation (tin alloying/de-alloying) processes between Sn and Li4.4Sn, but its effect is limited by the huge volume variation of the materials and aggregation of Sn particles. Thus, the pulverization of electrode materials and electric separation of active particles are unavoidable, resulting in rapid capacity decay [31]. In addition, SnS2 is an n-type semiconductor, whose conductivity is located in the range of 10 12–10 2 S/cm [32, 33]. In order to solve/alleviate the issues, various approaches have been employed to improve the electrochemical performance of tin-based sulfide anode for lithium-ion batteries.\nSu et al. [34] investigated deeply the dynamical process of the multistep reactions using in situ electron microscopy and discover the formation of an intermediate rock salt phase with the disordering of Li and Sn cations after initial two-dimensional intercalation, as shown in Fig. 6.6. The in situ observations and calculations suggest a two-phase reaction nature for intercalation, disordering, and following conversion reactions. In addition, crystalline Sn nanoparticles are well arranged within an amorphous Li2S “matrix” in this self-assembled framework. This nanoscale framework confines the locations of individual Sn nanoparticles and prevents particle agglomeration during the subsequent cycling processes, therefore providing desired structural tolerance and warranting a sufficient electron pathway [35].\nTwo-dimensional layered SnS2 nanoplates were prepared by a facile thermal decomposition method [36]. Figure 6.7 shows their structural features. It can be seen clearly that many SnS2 nanoplates with hexagonal structure lay flat on the substrate along with the zone axis of [001]. The enhanced electrochemical properties associated with SnS2 nanoplates can be attributed to their two-dimensional layered characteristics, including finite lateral size and enhanced open edges, which can facilitate Li-ion diffusion through\n272 Q. Tang et al.\nthe active materials and decrease the overvoltage for associated with the Li-Sn alloying reaction, thus driving a faster electrode reaction and providing a higher charge/discharge capacity and excellent cycling stability.\nStructural phase transitions can be used to alter the properties of a material without adding any additional elements and are therefore of significant technological value. Guo et al. [37] found that the hexagonal SnS2 phase can be transformed into the orthorhombic SnS phase after annealing in an argon atmosphere, and the transformed SnS shows enhanced energy storage performance over that of the SnS2 due to its structural advantages, as shown in Fig. 6.8. Meanwhile, the well-developed two-dimensional nanosheets of SnS and graphene and the precise hierarchical control of various sublayers of the materials are believed to function synergistically to counterbalance the active material’s large volume change; therefore, the mechanical, electrical, and electrochemical properties can be stabilized significantly.\na b c\nd e\nf g\nh i\n(0 01\n)\n(0 02\n)\n(0 03\n)\nbu lk\nS nS\n2\nIntensity (a.u.)\n2θ (\nde g.\n)\n2D S\nnS 2\nna no\npl at\nes\n: L i i\non\n< 1\n50 n\nm\n< 1\n50 n\nm\nV S\n.\nS nS\n2 na\nno pl\nat es\nLi 4.\n4S n\nS n\n+ 4\n.4 Li\nLi -S\nn al\nlo yi\nng\nde al\nlo yi\nng\n20 40\n60 80\n(1 11\n) (1\n03 )(0\n04 )(\n11 3)\n(2 02\n) ( 20\n3)( 11\n4)\ncax\nis\nS nS\n2 na\nno pl\nat es\n(2 12\n)\n(1 02\n)( 11\n0)\n(1 01\n)\n10 0\nnm\n10 0\nnm\n2 nm\n5 nm\n90 °\ntil tin\ng\n20 0\nnm\n(1 00\n)\n> m\nic ro\nm et\ner s\nFi g .6\n.7 (c on\ntin ue d)\n274 Q.

Also, they suggested the non-cycling Li2S and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide substrates are of essence for the capacity retention of Li alloyed/de-alloyed Sn nanoparticle electrodes. As recognized earlier, they reduce the volume fraction of the lithiated/delithiated tin, and they limit the mechanical stress associated with the expansion upon lithiation and shrinkage upon delithiation."

Like tin sulfides (SnSe, SeSe2), tin selenides also have a hexagonal phase and layered structural motif which are an important class of lithium storage materials because lithium-ions can be inserted and stored between the weakly interacting layers. However, as mention above, the main difficulties for using tin selenides are their dramatic volume expansion and poor cyclic performance.\nChoi et al.

It was found that two-dimensional ternary tin-based chalcogenides, including SnSeS and SnSe0.5S0.5, can also be a promising candidate as an electrode material in energy storage devices due to their characteristic layered structure [43–46]. In addition, pioneering research reported that partial S doping in selenides could optimize the electrical conductivity via increasing charge carrier (hole) concentration. At the same time, the surface sulfur donor states could be enhanced with the sulfidation on the selenides [47, 48].

Thus, various approaches have been carried out to improve the conductivity of MoS2 and alleviate the volume change during the discharge/ charge process.\nUnderstanding the structure and phase changes associated with conversion-type materials is key to optimizing the electrochemical performance in Li-ion batteries. For Li-ion batteries, MoS2 offers almost threefold improvement in capacity compared to currently used graphite anodes. However, in MoS2 electrodes, from 1.1 V versus Li+/ Li onward, Li+ begin to react with sulfur atoms, and MoS2 gradually changes from a trigonal prismatic (2H-MoS2) to an octahedral (1T-LixMoS2) phase [51]. After this phase transition, conversion reactions are intensified at 0.5 V versus Li+/Li, causing MoS2 to fragment and disintegrate into LiS2 and Mo nanoparticles. When these reactions coincide with electrolyte decomposition, most of the electrode turns into a gel-like matrix containing Mo nanoparticles. The overall reaction typically leads to low capacity and poor columbic efficiency. Thus, George et al. [52] found new sulfurenriched intermediates that progressively insulate MoS2 electrodes and cause instability from the first discharge cycle by combining ab initio density functional theory (DFT) simulation with electrochemical analysis and further confirm the electrochemical reaction mechanism of Li-MoS2 batteries, as shown in Fig. 6.14. In the discharge curves, the sloping plateau at 1.8 V corresponds to the onset of Li-ion insertion in MoS2 (according to MoS2 + xLi\n+ + xe ! LixMoS2). At 1.2 V versus Li+/Li, Li+ begin to react with S atoms to form a LiS2 matrix in which Mo metallic clusters are embedded (according to 2Li+ + S + 2e ! Li2S) [53]. Below 0.5 V versus Li+/Li is a deep conversion zone along with the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI). TheMoS2double-walled carbon nanotube (DWCNT) electrodes showed a specific capacity of 1400 mAh/g, while the MoS2-Super P delivered 900 mAh/g at 100 mA/g.\nZhang et al. [55] developed a simple one-pot hydrothermal route for the fabrication of MoS2/nitrogen-doped graphene composite (MoS2/N-G). In this composite, MoS2 nanosheets are well grown onto the N-doped graphene, generating a unique veillike hybrid nanostructure (Fig. 6.15). The in situ nitrogen doping derived from N-containing polydopamine (PDA, [-(C16H12N2O4)-]n) effectively increases the conductivity of the whole electrode. Meanwhile, the strong coupling between MoS2 and nitrogen-doped\n6 Metal-Based Chalcogenide Anode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries 281\ngraphene improves the cycling stability of the electrode material. In addition, two-dimensional MoS2 ultrafine nanosheets aligned with graphene reduce the diffusion path of Li-ions. These contributions boost the electrochemical performance of MoS2/NG as the anode material for LIBs. The as-prepared MoS2/N-G composite manifests a highly reversible capacity, superior rate performance, and superior cycling stability.\nWen et al. [56] demonstrated an effective and simple method to synthesize a threedimensional network architecture with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) cross-linked hollow carbon spheres (HCS) as a scaffold of few-layer MoS2 nanosheets, in which MoS2 nanosheets are in situ grown on the surface of both RGO and HCS, forming a three-dimensional network architecture, as shown in Fig. 6.16. In this composite, MoS2 nanosheets are tightly overlying on interconnected RGO/HCS conductive networks, which not only effectively hinders the aggregation of MoS2 nanosheets and restacking of graphene nanosheets but also buffers the volumetric expansion during the lithium-ion insertion/extraction processes, being beneficial for improving the structural stability and cycling ability. Furthermore, the three-dimensional porous scaffolds of RGO/HCS are intimately face-to-face in contact; in this way, the few-layer MoS2 sheets could greatly enhance the electrical conductivity and facilitate the electrolyte/ion transport, resulting in fast electrochemical reaction kinetics and much improved reversible capacity and rate capability. In addition, the expanded interlayer spacing could be able to compromise the stress caused by lithium-ion insertion and extraction and thus benefit fast ion intercalation and provide more lithium-ions’ storage sites. Finally, the three-dimensional honeycomb-like network structures may enhance the affinity of the electrolyte and increase the contact sites between MoS2 active materials and the electrolyte, leading to an enhanced Li+ accessibility and reduce the Li-ion diffusion length.\nFig. 6.12 Electrochemical performance of SnSe0.5S0.5/C nanocomposites for lithium-ion batteries: (a) CV curves at the scan rate of 0.1 mV/s; (b) cycling performance at 0.2 A/g; (c) rate performance at the different current density from 0.1 to 5.0 A/g; (d) charge/discharge profiles at the various rate; (e) cycling performance and Coulombic efficiency for 1000 cycles at 0.5 A/g.

The 2H phase MoS2 exhibits\na monolayer band gap of 1.9 eV, which reduces its conductivity and thus is not immediately attractive to be used as an electrode material for energy storage.

There are various binary iron sulfide (FeS, FeS2, Fe3S4, and Fe7S8)-type electrodes for batteries.\nThe pyrite FeS2 is a natural mineral, which is extensively used to obtain sulfuric acid. Its low price and the theoretical capacity of 894 mAh/g make it very competitive as a commercial electrode material for battery devices. As early as the 1990s, Energizer Corporation first produced commercial primary FeS2/Li 18,650-type batteries. Unfortunately, the poor cycling performance of FeS2 seriously hinders its wide application in rechargeable batteries. It was reported that the intercalation (Eq. 6.8) and conversion-type reaction (Eq. 6.9) coexists in the first cycle [60]. Generally, the latter reaction brings severe volume change to the electrode materials and sluggish kinetics for the reconstruction of FeS2 at charge process, resulting in the inferior cyclic performance [61].\nFeS2 þ xLiþ þ xe !

[62] employed operando studies to understand the conversion material FeS2 (Fig. 6.19). X-ray absorption spectroscopy, pair distribution function analysis, and first-principles calculations of intermediate structures shed light on the mechanism of charge storage in the Li-FeS2 system, with some general principles emerging for charge storage in metal-based chalcogenide materials. They also focused on the second and later charge/discharge cycles and find small, disordered domains that locally resemble iron (Fe) and Li2S at the end of the first discharge. Upon charge, this is converted to a Li-Fe-S composition whose local structure reveals tetrahedral coordination for Fe. With the continued charge, this ternary composition displays insertion/extraction behavior at higher potentials and lower Li content. The finding of hybrid modes of charge storage, rather than simple\n6 Metal-Based Chalcogenide Anode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries 287\nconversion, points to the important role of intermediates that appear to store charge by mechanisms that more closely resemble intercalation.\nShen et al.

The characterization of the structure and morphology reveals that the FeS2/RGO composite has interconnected networks of RGO sheets and the FeS2 microparticle (Fig. 6.20). The unique structure of the FeS2/ RGO composite provides a high contact area between the electrolyte and the\nelectrode, efficient electron conducting pathway, perfect protection against the volume change of anode materials, and excellent electrical conductivity of the overall electrode during electrochemical process.\nIt is known that iron sulfides, like other transition metal sulfides or oxides, suffer from low reversible capacity due to their poor electronic conductivity. Meanwhile, insulating polysulfides Li2Sx (2 < x < 8) are produced during the Li storage process by conversion reactions, and these can easily dissolve in organic electrolytes and migrate to the cathode side, preventing further electrochemical Li storage reactions and resulting in poor cyclability during charge/discharge [64]. To overcome these problems, size control of iron sulfides and the restrained dissolution of polysulfides in the electrolyte are of great importance. For example, Cheng et al. [64] successfully prepared iron sulfide nanoparticle (NP)-filled CNTs (denoted Fe-S@CNTs), as shown in Fig. 6.21. Due to the unique nanoconfinement effect of the CNTs, the growth and aggregation of Fe-S NPs were efficiently suppressed during the synthesis reaction, and their huge volume expansion during lithiation was accommodated by the interior space and strong walls of the CNTs. The electrical disconnection of Fe-S and the dissolution of polysulfides in the electrolyte during the electrochemical conversion reaction were avoided by their confinement in the CNTs. As a result of this structural stability and the Li-ion transfer kinetics, the Fe-S@CNT electrode exhibits an exceptionally stable capacity retention and improved rate capability for highly reversible Li storage.\nIron sulfide (FeS), as one kind of metal sulfide, completes the lithium-ion storage via 2FeS + 2Li+ + 2e ! Li2S + Fe reaction, giving a theoretical specific capacity of 609 mAh/g [65]. Xue et al. [66] reported a facile one-pot solid-state method to prepare iron sulfide (FeS) confined in the three-dimensional matrix of porous carbon (PC) [FeS/PC composite]. The FeS/PC had an initial discharge capacity of 1428.8 mAh/g at 0.1 C, the highest value as far as we know, and 624.9 mAh/g capacity can still remain after 150 cycles. The systematic characterizations and electrochemical study of FeS/PC composite anode material for LIBs are presented. Wang et al. [67] combined anatase titania (TiO2) with FeS and synthesized the FeS@TiO2 nanowires assembled by numerous nanosheets by using a typical hydrothermal method, as shown in Fig. 6.22. The carbon-free nanocoated composite electrodes exhibit improved reversible capacity of 510 mAh/g after 100 discharge/charge cycles at 0.2 A/g, much higher than that of the pristine FeS nanostructures. Long-term cycling shows little performance degradation even after 500 discharge/charge cycles at a current density of 0.4 A/g.\nGreigite (Fe3S4), a kind of significant half-metallic magnetic material, has been investigated its application for energy storage batteries. Compared with FeS and FeS2, Fe3S4 has a better electrical conductivity due to its inverse spinel structure. In addition, it exhibits a theoretical capacity of 785 mAh/g, two times higher than the conventional anode material graphite (372 mAh/g). Considering that its nontoxic and abundance, it is an optional material for high-performance lithium-ion batteries. Wang et al. [68] reported a kind of hollow nanosphere Fe3S4, as shown in Fig. 6.23. The growth process of the Fe3S4 hollow spheres has been investigated based on the observations of time-dependent experiments. For applications, these Fe3S4 hollow structures in LIBs exhibit stable capacity retention of 750 mAh/g over 100 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A/g.\nIn the recent, Fe7S8 also is considered as electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries due to its improved electrochemical performance with a theoretical capacity of 663 mAh/g [69]. According to the report from Zhu et al. [70], the discharge process of Fe7S8 anode materials is shown in the following:\nDischarge process:\nFe7S8 þ 8Liþ þ 8e ! 4Li2FeS2 þ 3Fe0 (6:10) Li2FeS2 þ 2Liþ þ 2e ! 2Li2Sþ Fe0 (6:11)\nCharge process:\n2Li2Sþ Fe0 !: Li2FeS2 þ 2Liþ þ 2e (6:12) Li2FeS2 ! Li2 xFeS2 þ xLiþ þ xe 0:5 < x < 0:8ð Þ (6:13)\nIn order to address its big volume change and poor electrical conductivity, Zhou et al. [71] successfully prepared Fe7S8 nanoparticles attached on the carbon networks\nby a simple freeze-drying process followed by the subsequent calcination, forming the Fe7S8@C composite. As anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, its reversible capacity can maintain at 667 mAh/g at a high current density of 2 A/g after 200 cycles, as shown in Fig. 6.24."

In addition to them, GeS2 and Sb2S3 were also expected to serve as outstanding candidates. For example, Yu et al. [80] reported an RGO-supported Sb2S3 nano-crystallites. The usefulness of the new material and synthesis approach is demonstrated by highly efficient and stable lithium battery anodes. Since both sulfur lithiation and antimony-lithium alloying reactions are reversible, they both contribute to the charge capacity, which exceeds 720 mAh/g after 50 cycles at a current density of 0.25 A/g. The very small crystallite size of the stibnite provides a minimum diffusion pathway and allows for excellent capacity retention at a high rate (>480 mAh/g at the current density of 2.0 A/g was observed). Ge is one of the most fascinating elements as an anode material because it can allow a large quantity of Li, thereby acquiring a high theoretical capacity (Li3.75Ge: 1385 mAh/g) at room temperature. In addition, the Li-ion conductivity and electrical conductivity in Ge are 400 and 100 times greater, respectively, than those of Si [81]. Park et al.

      "text" : "The urgent energy requirement and environmental pollution produce much strain for scientists to develop clean and sustainable technologies that can provide abundant energy in an environmentally friendly way. Metal-based chalcogenides (MXs) are considered as promising anode for lithium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacities, abundant resources, low cost, etc. Nevertheless, the high capacity corresponding to a large amount of lithium-ion intercalation also brings large volume expansion, and the general conversion reaction, especially for metal-based sulfides anodes, will introduce soluble intermediates such as polysulfides, which could cause sea very capacity loss and safety problems, such as a shuttle effect that is similar to that in Li-S batteries. In addition, the poor conductivity of chalcogenides also influences their electrochemical performance. A great deal of effort has been dedicated in recent years to solving these potential issues and improving the performance of lithium-ion batteries to keep up with the demands for its applications. In this chapter, various metal-based chalcogenides and corresponding modification method, mainly including composite with carbon and nano-crystallization. Carbon modification of MXs has been considered as the most basic strategy. Carbon materials with different dimensions were selected to provide stable support for MXs and increase electrical conductivity, such as zero-dimensional carbon nanoparticles, one-dimensional carbon nanotubes, two-dimensional graphene, and threedimensional carbon spheres. Nanocomposites show higher surface area, more active sites, and shorter transport path lengths for electrons and lithium-ion. Also, nanostructures with suitable void space (such as hollow, core/shell, or yolk/shell structure) can accommodate large volume change of electrodes during electrochemical reaction process effectively, which could improve the cycling stability of anode materials.\nIn the future, rational synthesis of metal-based chalcogenides anodes should be paid more attention to further develop some new structures with novel morphology, various hybrids, and doping, which could enhance the structural stability and conductivity. In addition, the following issues should be paid more attention to in the future research: Firstly, the large irreversible capacity was always observed in the first cycle, which means that a large portion of lithium-ions could not be utilized again in the following cycles when paired with a cathode in full cell. Secondly, further exploration of the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte should be carried out with a modified design of electrolyte systems that could result in enhanced performances. Thirdly, although conventional electrochemical characterization techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic intermittent titration, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, etc., are able to reveal the performance of bulk hybrid electrodes, they can hardly probe the intrinsic properties of the active material itself during ion insertion. Thus, more researches need to be dedicated to understanding the underlying mechanisms of the changes induced in the behavior of MXs by ion intercalation, especially the electronic structure and charge transfer features.\n298 Q.

This has not only boosted industrial interest in LIBs but also attracted major research efforts all over the world. Though all components of LIBs are crucial, their quality factors are chiefly linked with their cathode materials. That is why the majority of research is focused on upgrading the quality of cathode material. Depending on the family of materials and its coordination geometry, various families of cathodematerials include chalcogenides, layered oxides, silicates, phosphates, and tavorites. In addition, there are conversion electrodes, but they lie outside the scope of this review. These classes of materials are of interest in LIB-focused research. This chapter is devoted to providing an overview of the current status and time evolution of LIBs, with a focus on cathode materials. The primary objective of this overview is to shed light on the subject matter to identify the main problems encountered by LIBs so that solutions may be sought. To present a comprehensive picture of the story, the computational and experimental literature is discussed.\nI. U. Ashraf · A.

      "text" : "In the present technological age, the development of efficient and convenient sources of electrical power is one of the major scientific challenges to operate current and future appliances. To improve the quality of human life on this planet, in parallel with tackling issues related to various areas, including health, industrialization, telecommunications, agriculture, food, and climate change, for example, securing sustainable energy sources has become an issue of prime significance. The development agenda of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly has assigned several targets to member countries with a focus on a number of goals to accomplish by 2030. One of the key targets is to identify sustainable, affordable, safe, and modern energy sources. While giving opening remarks at a UN General Assembly session on climate change in 2015,1 Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon2 expressed his thoughts on the importance of renewable energy sources and mentioned that global concerns on energy are due to accelerating demands based on ecological and economic factors. To meet energy needs, currently exploited energy sources are being quickly exhausted, which is threatening basic human needs.\nEcological concerns are important as energy sources like fossil fuels and even nuclear energy are not environmentally friendly, and we have to bear the deprivation in the earth environment in the form of an immense increase in Earth entropy. Keeping these considerations in view, it is high time to address energy issues and search for renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources. Developed countries and emerging economic powers are investing heavily in renewable energy sources like hydro, thermal, and biofuels. The 2050 roadmap issued by the International Renewable Energy Agency forecasted a loss of 7.4 million jobs in the nonrenewable energy sector and the creation of 19 million jobs related to renewable energy. According to the Renewables Global Futures Report 2017 (REN21),3 employment in the renewable energy sector has increased at a rate of 1.1%, with 9.8 million people employed in 2016 in comparison to 2015. REN21 2017 estimate shows that renewable energy accounts for 62% of the total global power-generating capacity. Solar PV gave almost 47% of newly installed renewable power capacity in 2016, whereas wind and hydrothermal sources account for 34% and 15.5%, respectively. Solar energy was the leading source of power generation around the world in 2016 when market investment increased by 50%.\nSince 2015, energy demands in the transport sector have increased at a 2% annual rate, resulting in an overall energy consumption rate of 28%. The main categories for the energy usage in the transportation sector include biofuels mixed with\n1General Assembly.

Electrical systems are known to offer viable power storage in the form of batteries. These sources are increasing, although electrification of transport faces several challenges, including cost, limited driving range, short battery life, and charging infrastructure [1].\nIn discussions related to the electrification of vehicles and the use of portable electric appliances, the focus is on batteries and capacitors as storage systems. Conventional Electric vehicles (EVs) and portable appliances were powered by lead-acid and nickelbased batteries. These nickel cadmium and nickel-iron batteries were the first of currently used nickel metal hydride (third-generation) batteries, which are the best choice for vehicles thanks to their low operating voltage and low reduction potential for water (1.2 V) in heavy electrodes (20–70 Wh/kg). But hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plugin HEVs (PHEVs) require different materials depending on their intended use. Usually, HEVs are charged by the regeneration of power during breaking and cover a few kilometers in electric mode, while PHEVs are charged by direct powering and give full support on electric power and cover comparatively larger distances in electric mode. Thus, they require different battery materials with different specifications, materials with excellent parameter values like energy density, power density, low weight, high cyclability, and safe/reliable operation. These materials were replaced by sodium nickel chloride (Na-NiCl2). The materials of Li-ion batteries have evolved over time and are comprehensively discussed by M. Thackeray et al. [2]\nThough other batteries may be mentioned, the current write-up core focus is on lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Lithium-ion (Li-ion) chemistry for energy storage is the most appropriate technology of choice in current portable electronics, mechanical tools, and especially in electrified transport like HEVs and PHEVs. These have evolved enough to dominate consumer electronics and transportation. This is because of their outstanding qualities like specific energy (J/kg or Wh/kg), high energy density (Wh/I or J/I), specific power (W/kg), power density (W/I), safe operation, low cost, and long battery life [3]. Their high efficiency also allows their use in grid stations to improve energy-harvesting projects, including wind energy, solar energy, and other renewable energy sources. Yet there are gaps to be filled, like that they require long charge times and safety issues for high-temperature regimes. Hence, work is still being done in this area, and it is a hot topic of research interest around the world in both public- and private-sector funding agencies. Current issues of battery explosions, for example, the Samsung Note7 phone and Boeing’s Dreamliner airplane, have raised serious safety concerns [4]. LIBs are unique compared to other water-based technologies like lead-acid and nickelcadmium in that they have persistent issues, such as their ability to work only in a +50 C to 50 C temperature range, which limits their use in terrestrial environmenst; they are also heavy, and safety issues make them inferior to LIBs.\nWhile discussing the aforementioned quality parameters of Li-ion batteries, we argue that these parameters are controlled by the characteristics that control all electrochemical reactions, including surface area, the potential difference between electrodes, ion diffusion properties, and related kinetics. All advances in batteries are linked to electrochemical processes that are inferred to evaluate the performance and\n7 Cathode Material in Lithium-Ion Battery 307\nstability of cells [2]. The evolution of LIBs is one of innovation, miniaturization, and development of new chemistries, although LIB development is still research in progress.

      "text" : "LIBs basically consist of electrodes, i.e., cathode and anode, separated by a solid electrolyte. These electrodes are connected externally by a circuit that allows electrons to flow, and internally these are connected by the electrolyte that allows the diffusion of Li ions but doesn’t allow electrons to pass through [6]. The basic configuration remains the same throughout the historical evolution of LIBs [7], and these are very similar to conventional batteries in construction and oxidationreduction reactions taking place at electrodes. The difference lies in the fact that in conventional batteries, an oxidation-reduction reaction occurs simultaneously at interfaces, but in LIBs these reactions occur with the mass diffusion of Li ions along the electrolyte. During the charging process, energy is provided externally and Li+ ions are removed from the cathode and diffuse through the solid electrolyte toward the anode. During the extraction of positive Li ions, to maintain charge neutrality, an electron is lost from the electrode material and flows to the external circuit. The electron flows in the wires of the external circuit because it cannot pass through the electrolyte. In this way, the Li ion moves through the solid electrolyte, whereas electrons move from the external circuit and then meet at the anode, thereby causing Li ions to complete one cycle. The same process is reversed in the discharging process when we connect any load in the circuit. The complete process is elaborated in Fig. 7.1."

The cathode is the transit station for ions and electrons. The material of the cathode must deal with undesirable phase transitions and chemical reactions, including parasitic reactions at the electrode/ electrolyte interface and oxidation/reduction reactions. These may cause temperature-dependent destabilization, including volumetric changes during the insertion and removal of lithium ions, which has made cathode material a central subject of research [3]. The insertion of ions in a cathode occurs during the spontaneous process of battery discharge, extraction of ions take place during the charging process for which we need to provide the external electric potential. Hence, a functional material capable of efficiently and reversibly shuttling Li ions through it self and ensure the physical and chemical stability of the material can be used as cathode material for LIBs.\n308 I. U. Ashraf and A.

This material is not found naturally, so it is always synthesized and was first produced in 1975 [11]. Titanium sulfide (TiS2) is a semimetal with a very common cadmium iodide structure. It has a space group of P3ml d33d that has point group symmetry that is mainly trigonal [11] and a layered structure where Ti is sandwiched between two S layers, with each sandwich composed of planes of titanium atoms that reside between sulfur atoms, and these layers are attached to each other by weak Van der Waals forces. Crystalline indexing can be done by a hexagonal a structure with a = 3.407 Ǻ and c = 5.695 Ǻ. These have a layered structure, enabling the shuttling of Li ions in the structure. We generally show this by an MX or MX2-type structure, where M represents any metal from group 4 to group 10 and X represents chalcogen atoms, including S, Se, and Ti. The crystalline structure is shown in Fig. 7.2. A large interlayer gap facilitates Li-ion diffusion.\nThe Li+ storage capacity of transition metal (TM) dichalcogenides up to the present level is 1000 mAh/g, which is much higher than currently used graphite electrodes that have a Li storage capacity of 372 mAh/g [13, 14]. A number of examples have shown excellent performance of LIBs [15–20].\n310 I. U. Ashraf and A. Majid\nThe crystalline structure of Li intercalated TM chalcogenide lithium titanium sulfide (LiTiS2) has been studied using diffraction analysis, and it was found that the structure could still be explained in terms of the hexagonal unit cell. However, it was found that the c-axis lattice parameter increased due to the insertion of Li ions, which is the main effect of Li insertion. No structural phase transition was found during this process, which shows that these materials could be used as an intercalation electrode [21–24]. Titanium sulfide–based electrodes still have a higher energy density and intercalation kinetics compared to layered oxide materials like lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) and lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) [23, 25–28], as we have already described these have layered structures. When Li ions intercalate across layers, the transfer of electrons occurs from Li atom to metal cation in the structure and weak van der Waals forces are replaced by strong Coulombic interactions. The strong forces bind the structure and make it resistant to expansion. Hence, a reliable intercalation framework that supports Li kinetics in its structure is made available by elucidating the structural elastic and electronic effects during intercalation [24, 29–34]."

      "text" : "The earliest commercialized material in LIBs were layered oxides, specifically lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2). This material has a redox potential of 4 eV and its structural and diffusion mechanism features are described in what follows.\nDepending on the stacking of oxygen, these materials have three main types of structures:\n(1) ABCABC octahedral type (O3), (2) ABBA prismatic type (P2), and (3) ABBCCA prismatic type (P3).\nAll these materials have layered geometries like chalcogenide materials, with a metal cation residing between two oxygen atoms, and this composes the layers of TM cations that are separated from the Li layers by oxygen; thus, overall there are tetrahedral and octahedral geometries as Li resides in an octahedral site surrounded by oxygen and it is neighbored by tetrahedral geometry from the metal cation, as shown in Fig. 7.3 for the LiCoO2 structure.\nThe metal could be manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), or iron (Fe), for example. In the case of a layered structure where Li-centered octahedral sites are coordinated with P-centered tetrahedral sites, Li-ion hopping or diffuses from an octahedral lattice site to another similar site via a transitional tetrahedral site [35]. It has been found that an intermediate tetrahedral site is the highest-energy-activated site throughout the transition and acts as the energy barrier during the Li hop, and this determines the hopping rate of the Li ion, which must overcome this energy barrier to complete the hop. It has been observed that a decrease in the energy barrier of 57 eV can increase by ten times the Li-ion migration. By calculating this energy barrier, the values of hopping rate and hence the power density can be found for cathode materials [35]. The diffusivity mechanism in lithium iron phosphate (Li5FeO4) has been\n7 Cathode Material in Lithium-Ion Battery 311\nstudied by atomistic simulation to explore the possible paths of Li-ion migration [36]. Two channels for the migration have been identified, channel X and channel Y (Fig. 7.4), which have respective values of activation energy of 0.45 and 0.56 eV.\nWhile increasing the power density of the electrode material, efforts are being devoted to optimizing the energy barrier during Li-ion hopping and to control other battery parameters that are linked with Li-ion hoop. For example, it has been demonstrated that doping of lithium manganese oxide (LiMnO2) with zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), Fe, and aluminum (Al) can enhance the stability of the battery material and result in better capacity retention with higher charge–discharge cycles. A Similar investigation was conducted using cationic and anionic doping in\nFig. 7.4 Li migration path in Li5FeO4 material. Two possible paths of Li ions (blue and pink spheres) are shown, channel X and channel Y. (Reprinted from Ref. [36]. © Open access permission from Nature)\n312 I. U. Ashraf and A. Majid\nthe Lithium Managnese oxide (LiMnO2). in cationic doping host structure was doped with Magnesium (Mg) Titanium (Ti) Vanadium (V) Niobium (Nb), Iron (Fe) Ruthenium (Ru) Cobalt (Co), Nickel (Ni), Copper (Cu) and Aluminium (Al). While in anionic doping Nitrogen (N) and fluorine (F) doped LiMnO2 was studied separately [37]. The material remained stable at all doping concentrations, and it was observed that some of the cations, like V, Nb, and Ru, significantly changed the redox potential of the host. An increase in capacity due to transition metal doping is also linked with oxygen loss in the cathode. In the charging process, electrons are compensated by the oxidation of metal cations; upon complete oxidation, for example, Mn4+ (3d3) cannot oxidize any further, and bound oxygen get free on oxidation and leave the structure. Electrons are given during this oxidation process, and this results in an increased capacity of the cathode material. This oxygen loss is directly linked to metal-ion substitution in the material and thus plays a role in determining the specific capacity of the material. For example, the substitution of Co metal cation in the material enhances oxygen loss, while Ti inclusion reduces it. The explanation lies in the fact that mutual overlapping of Co 3d-states with oxygen 2p-states, increases the covalent character, and increased delocalization affect the stability of oxygen. This high value of covalent behavior is not observed in Ti substitution, and this does not promote oxygen loss in the material [38, 39]. The evolution of singlet oxygen followed by carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) at a high charge conduction state could be the result of an oxidation reaction, which is a big reason for the capacity fade problem in LIBs [40].\nA recent study was conducted to explore an interesting aspect of this oxygen release at a high state of charge condition [41]. Lithium-nickel-cobalt-manganese oxide is a promising layered oxide cathode material in LIBs. It has a theoretical specific capacity of 278 mAh/g in a Li intercalation potential range of 3.0–5.0 V [41]. While the entire spectrum of specific capacity is still open to use, as the battery has a cut-off operating voltage of 4.3 V, at this specific value, only 60% of the total Li ions have been extracted, that results in a specific capacity of 160 mAh/g [42]. Li intercalation cannot be increased above a voltage of 4.3 V, at which point the material capacity decreases, reducing battery life. Other reasons for the decrease in operational lifetime include electrolyte oxidation [43], dissolution of metal cations [44–46], structural evolution during Li charge–discharge cycles [47], an increase in cathode impedance [42, 48, 49], and decay of Li ions in the material [46].\nFurther, different metals have varying oxidation and reduction capabilities, for example, Ni has the ability to reduce instantly, while Mn has a favorable reduction capability, so understanding these concepts helps to optimize synthesis conditions [50]. Efforts are in progress to use lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt oxide (LiNiCoMnO2) as anode material in LIBs, which may solve problems of safety and low capacity in previously used graphite and lithium titanate (LiTiO12) anodes."

Similarly, lithium-manganese oxide LiMn2O4 has spinel structure. With lithium insertion, the Li ions reside at tetrahedral sites of the structure, Mn atoms occupy octahedral 16d sites, and oxygen atoms occupy 32e sites, and the whole structure is arranged in a cubelike structure [52]. This forms a 3d repeating manganese-oxide (Mn2O4) framework with an edge sharing octahedral form having intermediate tunnels for Li-ion percolation, as shown in Fig. 7.5 [52].\nAs electrode materials, composites from the spinal family have good electronic and chemical properties with respect to energy storage, as exemplified by lithiummanganese oxide (LiMn2O4), an excellent electrode material thanks to its low cost, its environmentally friendly properties, and safety concerns [54, 55]. However, this material has a major capacity-fading problem under high flux and elevated temperature conditions. A number of reasons have been proposed for this fading [55–57], such as electrode–electrolyte chemical reactions on the surface of the electrode, manganese (Mn) dissolution in electrolyte, Jahn–Teller distortion, phase transformation during battery operation, particle size, and morphology. For example, octahedron-shaped cathode particles with 111 surface terminations have a retention capacity that is superior to that of pallet-shaped lithium-manganese oxide (LMO) with 001 surface termination. The reason for this is given in terms of dissolution of Mn that was more prominent in the case of 001 surface terminations [58].\nDiffusion Mechanism in Spinal Oxides The diffusion mechanism pathways have also been studied using experimental and theoretical techniques. The spinal structure exhibits good stability on the process of\n314 I. U. Ashraf and A.

This diffusion mechanism has also been verified in lithium titanate (Li2Ti2O4), where Li diffuses between two consecutive octahedral sites through a transitional tetrahedral site, and this energy barrier varies with Li-ion concentration inversely; the barrier variation is shown in Fig. 7.6 [60, 61]."

LiMPO4s are composed of regularly arranged phosphate anion (PO4\n3 ) tetrahedral units that actually separate the two-corner sharing octahedra that are based on metal oxide (MO6) and lithium oxide (LiO6) (where the metal could be iron, Fe); overall this crystallizes into an orthorhombic structure. Both of these octahedra are distinct and are of different sizes; in this way they are different from the spinal family of materials [61, 62] (Fig. 7.7).\nThis material is viable because of its overall behavior in each required quality parameter of low cost, good safety conditions, working potential of 3.4 V, and a capacity of 170 mAh/g [64]. These materials approach their theoretical capacity of 170 mAh/g. However, LiFePO4 is considered more advantageous than other members of this family because of its good quality parameters: safety, low cost, and high capacity. However, LiFePO4 also has the drawback of low electronic and ionic mobility that Limitize its application in the power electronics and automobile industry [65, 66]. At ambient temperature conditions, this material has an electronic conductivity of 10 9 Ohm/cm and diffusion coefficient of approximately 10 14–10 16 cm2/s. These parameters were calculated using various experimental and theoretical techniques. It has been seen that structural evolution plays an important role in determining Li-ion mobility in a structure, and various techniques have been developed to increase ionic mobility in structures by doping and codoping with TM cations and using different operating conditions [67–70].\nThe Li-ion migration pathway is once again found happening between two neighboring octahedra through an intermediate tetrahedron. A Li ion will be stable at an octahedral site having a vacant tetrahedral neighboring site. Theoretical investigation of the diffusion process of Li ions using first principle–based calculations has been performed by Henkelman et al. It has been formalized that a Li-ion diffusion barrier is strongly influenced by a crystalline environment, types of defects, and Li-ion concentration in the material. Since theoretical values do not correspond to experimental values, first, they tried to analyze the reason behind this by calculating the diffusivity at different levels, including surface diffusion, bulk diffusion, and cross-channel diffusion; they also showed that lattice strain also plays a key role in determining the Li-ion diffusion barrier [71]."

They have the ability to make Li ions shuttle back from a structure, doubling the value of the material’s capacity, and Mn’s rapid oxidation state of +4 plays a key role in the process, and we can achieve a theoretical capacity in a range of 330 mAh/g with a working voltage of 4.0 V [65, 72–79].\nJust like LiFePO4, this is also a polyanionic material that contains a distorted hexagon with an edge-sharing tetrahedron. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites are occupied by Li, Mn, and silicon (Si) variously, and it has a number of phases identified that vary upon Li extraction and insertion. The recognized phases for Li2FeSiO4 includes orthorhombic Pmn21, Pmnb, and monoclinic Pn, P21/n, of which the Pmn21 orthorhombic phase is considered thermodynamically most stable. It shows the lowest migration barrier and gives favorable Li-ion mobility.\nLi2Mn2SiO4 has technical challenges, such as phase variation during operating by diverting from the preferred phase of Pmn21 during synthesis and operation. This phase shifting may be due to the presence of Mn antisite defects and a Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+ ions, which lead to structural destabilization [77–79] and thereby producing Li-ion diffusion that results in a small range of theoretical capacity. Other barriers include low electron mobility that is four times lower than olivine-type phosphate materials [65, 78, 79]. That is a major barrier to Li-ion extraction and thus limits its application as an electrode material.

As we can see, the very low redox potential of 1.8 V in V2+/V3+ for LiVPO4F makes it impractical to utilize LiVPO4O, which also has to face the challenge of poor cycle stability [95, 96].\nUsing first principles and molecular dynamics–based techniques, the diffusion path and activation energy barrier of Li-ion transport in materials have been studied.

They include the specific family of materials like fluorides and chlorides in metallic combinations. There are many reasons to use these materials as conversion electrodes; one reason is to have an intermediate operation voltage, but nonetheless they have drawbacks, including, for example, their poor conductivity and hysteresis losses [106]. Copper chloride has an octahedral structure, but it rarely exhibits this form due to Jahn–Teller distortions; further, different materials define respective elemental properties of that material. One of two materials AgCl and CuCl2 has been studied. Because of their higher oxidation state they utilize double electron transfer and used as efficient electrochemical conversion cathode. These materials are used due to the reason discussed as AgCl enhances the phase transformation reaction with the production of carbon which will be conductive [107]. It has been shown in the literature that metal chlorides can be used as efficient conversion cathodes because they have cations of relatively high oxidation states, which can be helpful to proceed phase transformation reactions which are necessary for it. The lower attraction of chlorides is due to the low the theoretical reticle capacity of chlorides compared to fluorides. Common chlorides are CuCl2, NiCl2, CoCl2, NiCl2, and FeCl3 which have the highest energy densities; however, one challenge remains: the corrosion of the metallic surface during their application.

To overcome these drawbacks, conversion cathode chemistries were developed, utilizing the same families of cathode materials such as chalcogenides and halides, for example. The theoretical capacity of metal halides is due to the reduction of metallic ions by the involvement of one lithium atom during conversion reactions. A comparison of the capacities of chalcogenides and chalcohalides is shown in Fig. 7.9.\nOther halide composites include salts of fluorine for use in LIBs that serve as a conversion cathode material known as iron trifluoride (FeF3), which has a high energy density and high theoretical capacity of 712 mAh/g [108].

Efforts have been made to overcome these drawbacks by forming nanowires of iron trifluoride [109]. Other important fluorides are copper fluorides. Peculiarities that make them effective are their high operating potential and high ionic characteristics of the metallic composite with a high electronegativity of fluorine. The bandgap becomes\n7 Cathode Material in Lithium-Ion Battery 321\nwider in this case but conductivities increase with nanosizing of the formulation. With increasing energy demands, there is a need to develop materials that possess high-capacity storage with minimum loss of charge and safeguard against safety issues, such as overheating. Striking a balance between materials that are environmentally friendly and cost-effective yet exhibit high charge densities is difficult as most combinations that make sense have already been evaluated. To predict the chemical properties of binary, ternary, and higher order metal oxides, density functional theory (DFT) has been used to mine for practical formulation from an array of hypothetical possibilities with the time constraints of actual synthesis and evaluation saving time and resources and enabling the researcher to focus on practical formulations which are predicted to exhibited the required characteristics of high charge, low cost and operational safety. Iron trifluoride is a material that has been studied, at the moderate potential of 2.7 V. Iron trifluoride reacts actively with three lithium ions to deliver the maximum theoretical power, which can be shown in the following equation:\nFeF3 þ 3Liþ þ 3e $ 3LiF þ α Fe 4:5 1:5 V vs lithium ion=lithiumð Þ Onemore important aspect of fluoride is that the structure of Li-Fe-F is very important in the ternary phase when iron the fluoride readily reacts with lithium [110, 111]. The electrochemical potential of lithium determines all the voltage profiles [103]. Iron(II)fluoride (FeF2) and copper(II) fluoride (CuF2) are promising materials for conversion cathodes in LIBs because of their high charge density and ability to operate at higher temperatures [112].\nLIBs are robust for portable electronics and are potential candidates for heavy energy storage for future use. Metal fluorides are suitable conversion cathodes that can be used effectively in LIBs because of their unique properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations made with a ternary system employs a potential energy function determined via a DFT basis with a Hubbard U Hamiltonian. The exchange and correlation potential are employed using the GGA + U approach. The implementation of the new approach GGA + U shows the Coulomb interaction inside the d-states exactly, which can play an important role in the orbital systems of both elements with the usage of GGA + U and a Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) functional to calculate the formation energies with the inclusion of insertion voltage of lithium ions with a composite of transition metal fluorides to study the conversion processes. The study of iron(II) fluorides (FeF2) and iron(III) fluorides (FeF3) shows that FeF2 immediately degrades into lithium fluoride (LiF) and Fe via lithiation. The lithiation process completes in three phases, which are shown in Fig. 7.10.\nMetal fluorides are extensively studied as conversion cathode material with a trigonal pyramidal geometry [113, 114]. An intercalation cathode transports only one lithium ion per formula unit to host lattices. Metal fluorides like FeF2 are best in this regard with favorable geometry, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Some metal fluorides like bismuth(III) fluoride (BiF3), FeF3, cobalt(II) fluoride (CoF2), and nickel(II) fluoride (NiF2) have the ability to show the highest voltage of hysteresis and lowest kinetics with lower reversibility of true conversion.\n322 I.

The abundance of sulfur is another one of their advantages; however, one disadvantage is their low potential for lithium/lithium ions [115]. Sulfide dissolution produces polysulfides, which stimulate the loss of a percentage of sulfur under vacuum. This kind of effect can be overcome by insulating the sulfur in a hollow structure to work effectively [115]. Future storage devices demand highly efficient energy storage devices, this is the reason an extensive study is going through LIB. One advantage is doping with sulfur to enhance electrochemical processes, which in turn increases energy density [116, 117]. Diffuse toward iron sulfide, which has a cubic structure with a theoretical capacity of 894 mAh/g. The efficiency factor in conversion reactions involving LIBs is the reversible dissolution of polysulfides [118]. Advanced energy storage devices such as LIBs use metal chalcogenides because they have good characteristics like mechanical and thermal stability and conductivity. The most suitable metal dichalcogenides in LIBs as conversion cathodes are disulfides (S2), tungsten(IV) disulfide (WS2), and niobium(IV) sulfide (NbS2) because they have remarkable electronic and charge density properties."

The electrochemical cell of selenium based materials can be enhanced by forming composites with porous carbon (PC). The composites in the form of nanosphere of Li with Se can also work efficiently [121]. Other composites of selenium with porous carbon nanofibers (PCN) as conversion cathode are attractive for their minimum capacity loss per cycle compared to others. This gives outstanding electrochemical performance. After 900 cycles it transfers the capacity of 516 mAh/g without any capacity loss.

In contrast, unbound or free tin oxide (SnO2) has a lower theoretical storage capacity than the composite form (SnO2/C) [110].\nAnother aspect of the discussion on oxides in conversion cathodes like lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2), lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO2), and lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) is the mechanism through which lithium ions pass, known as the rocking chair mechanism.

      "text" : "With the development and commercial application of electric vehicles, the extended driving range requires the high energy of the lithium-ion battery. Up to now, in most of the commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), carbon material, e.g., graphite (C), is used as anode material, while the cathode material changes from spinel lithium manganese oxide (LMO, LiMn2O4) and olivine lithium iron phosphate (LFP, LiFePO4) to layer-structured material lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM, LiNi1 x yCoxMnyO2) and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA, LiNi1 x yCoxAlyO2), which deliver increased gravimetric and volumetric energy density, due to the high specific electrochemical capacity and high density of NCM or NCA materials.\nThe high volumetric energy density of lithium-ion battery requires high-density cathode materials. The bulk density of cathode is closely related to the morphology, particle size, and the distribution. Generally, irregular-shaped particles tend to involve agglomeration, bridging, and voids and thus lose some packing density. However, regular spherical particles have good fluidity, their proper size distributions allow small particles to be filled into the voids of big particles with close packing. Therefore, the spheroidization is an effective way to increase the volumetric capacity of the cathode material. Commercial NCM materials are practically prepared by chemical coprecipitation method, which not only ensures the uniform dispersion of transition metal at the atomic level but also obtains high-density spherical precursors by process tuning.\nThe higher density is a requirement for electric vehicles to meet customer preference for increased stamina (distance before recharging of 300–500 km) or even long distance. Such a system requires high charge density based on high-energy-density cathode materials. Practically, Ni-rich NCM materials with high packing density are preferred. Based on LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111), LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523), LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622), and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811), the energy density of lithium-ion cells cycled in the cutoff voltages of 4.2 V–3.0 V can be achieved at 180, 210, 230, and 280 Wh.kg 1 (Fig. 8.1).\nLithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (LiNi1 x yCoxMnyO2) is essentially a solid solution of lithium nickel oxide-lithium cobalt oxide-lithium manganese oxide (LiNiO2-LiCoO2-LiMnO2) (Fig. 8.2). With the change of the relative ratio of x and y, the property changes generally corresponded to the end members. The higher the nickel (Ni) content, the higher is the capacity and more instability, the higher cobalt (Co) content means higher rate capability and higher cost, while the higher manganese (Mn) content means better thermal stability and lower cost. So the most important way to increase the energy density is to increase the Ni content, thus lowering the cobalt and manganese content. With increasing Ni content in LiNi1 x yCoxMnyO2, the charging capacity of NCM111, NCM523, NCM622, and NCM811 increases from 175 to 186, 198, and 213 mAh.g 1, respectively (Fig. 8.3) [4], while the cost decreases with the lowered Co content.\n8 Development of Lithium Nickel Cobalt Manganese Oxide as Cathode Material. . . 333\nBesides increasing the Ni content, another way to get high energy density is to increase the charging cutoff voltage. As an example of NCM523, the discharging capacity increases from 162.8 to 185.3, 196.9, and 208.1 mAh.g 1 when the upper charging cutoff voltage is increased from 4.25 to 4.40, 4.50, and 4.60 V (Fig. 8.4); meanwhile, the cost of unit energy decreases correspondingly. During the charging process, NCM materials undergo several phase transitions: H1 ! M ! H2 ! H3. H1, H2, and H3 represent three hexagonal phases and M a monoclinic one. Compared with H1 and H2, the H3 phase is in the deep delithiated state, which is extremely unstable in structure. As shown in Fig. 8.5, the redox onset of the H2 ! H3 phase transition of NMC811 starts at >4.0 V, while those of NMC111 and NMC622 commence at >4.4 V. So raising upper cutoff voltage is generally applied to low and middle nickel NCM materials [5]."

      "text" : "The charging and discharging capacities of lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide increase with the Ni content in the same cutoff voltages; therefore, the Ni-rich NCM materials are involved in a higher state of charge (SOC) with respect to the theoretical capacity, more phase transition, and larger volume change during (de)intercalation, which will further cause cracks inside the secondary particle along the grain boundary, at the triple junction where three primary particles touch. In such a way, when the particle cracking happens upon repeated charge-discharge, the structural stability deteriorates. As is mentioned in Sect. 8.2, the capacity and thus SOC increase with the increased charging cutoff voltage, and the crack becomes more serious, as illustrated in Fig. 8.6.\n2.8\n3.2\n3.6\n4.0\n4.4\n4.8\n0 50 100 150 200 250\nVo lta\nge /\nV\nCapacity / mAh.g-1\n4.25V 4.40V 4.50V 4.60V\nFig. 8.4 Charge-discharge profiles of NCM523 in varied cutoff voltages\nThe particle crack develops upon repeated cycling, especially at a high rate, or large depth of discharge (DOD) (Fig. 8.6) [6]. Particle cracking is supposed to be an additional but dominant failure mode of the agglomerated lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide materials, compared to the conventional single crystal material, e.g., lithium cobalt oxide, which is extensively used as cathode material in the lithium-ion battery (LIB) of consumer electronics.\nParticle cracks cause loss of inner particle connectivity and give rise to increased resistance and thus the degradation of performance. Besides, the electrolyte can penetrate along the crack into the particle, causing the increase of the interface area of NCM/electrolyte, and a relative shortage of the liquid electrolyte, the dry area inside the lithium cell may appear, and capacity may thus fade more quickly even drop sharply. On the other hand, the increase of the interface area of NCM/electrolyte may bring about the thermal instability and the risk of thermal runaway.\nOne solution to address the particle cracking is to make the NCM particle with high strength, resisting against the pressure during electrode pressing, and the internal stress from the repeated volume change of primary particle upon cycling. Of course, the first step is to prepare a precursor with enhanced strength, by tuning the coprecipitation conditions and even the inner configuration of the reactor. As an example of the precursor of good strength in Fig. 8.7, the particle of radial texture (Fig. 8.7a) enjoys high strength, while the other one with random texture (Fig. 8.7b)\n8 Development of Lithium Nickel Cobalt Manganese Oxide as Cathode Material. . . 337\ngives low strength. NCM cathode material made from the high strength precursor generally has better cycling stability. To a much extent, the particle crack can be alleviated, although not totally avoided in such a way.\nAnother effective way is to prepare single crystal type lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide materials, whose particle is strong enough to resist against physical press or internal stress. Generally, single crystal NCM material enjoys some unique attributes: (1) enhanced strength, alleviating particle crack; (2) increased pellet density, increasing the volumetric energy density; (3) lowered surface area, reducing the side reaction of NCM cathode with electrolyte; and (4) enhanced connectivity intra- and interparticles, in favor of electronic, ionic, and thermal conductivity of the electrode. Consequently, the single crystal NCM material enjoys better performance than conventional agglomerated counterpart, in terms of cycling stability, thermal storage, safety, as well as volumetric energy density. Table 8.1 gives a comparison of the performances of single crystal NCM-based LIB with those of the conventional NCM agglomerates. The single crystal particle still retains its integrity after longterm cycles.\nThe preparation of single crystal NCM materials can be achieved by adjusting the precursor process [7], increasing Li/Me and sintering temperature [8], or adding fusing agents for lowering sintering temperatures [9]."

There will be more serious side redox reaction\n338 Y. Chen and Y. Liu\nbetween cathode and electrolyte during thermal storage and cycling at elevated temperature. In general, higher Ni content NCM material suffers from worse chemical stability and thermal stability (related to the safety issue of lithium-ion cells). Subsequently, Ni-rich NCM material-based lithium cell is confronted with big challenges in cycling, thermal storage, and safety.\nMoreover, Ni-rich material behaves less stable when exposed in air, releasing lithium species impurities on the surface of the particles (this topic will be discussed in the following section).\nThe performance of NCM material depends fundamentally on the precursor Ni1 x yCoxMny(OH)2. The precursor is the predominant factor to be concerned with addressing the structural and chemical instability. Practically, Ni1 x yCoxMny(OH)2 precursor is prepared by mixing solutions of nickel sulfate, cobalt sulfate, and manganese sulfate with sodium hydroxide with a protective atmosphere of nitrogen (N2). The crystallinity of Ni1 x yCoxMny(OH)2 depends on the precipitation conditions, such as time duration, pH, stirring intensity, temperature, and atmosphere. Well-crystallized precursor with enhanced texture, fewer surface defects, and lower impurities is naturally advantageous for preparing NCM materials. In the industrial practice, the continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) or batch reactor is adopted to mass produce precursor material. Generally, the particle size distribution of precursor prepared by CSTR is wide, and that by batch mode is narrow (Fig. 8.8).\nSintering is also quite critical for the performance of NCM materials, oversintering or less-sintering will deliver poor electrochemical performance. In the case of NCM materials prepared from CSTR precursor with wide particle size distribution, small particles are generally over-sintered with bigger primary grain size, while large particle less-sintered with smaller grain size. In other words, large particles and small ones should be sintered at different temperature for optimized performance. In a sense, precursor produced in batch mode with fairly good consistency is preferred for NCM materials with respect to electrochemical performance.\nDoping is a common way for modification of functional materials. LiNi1 x yCoxMnyO2 itself is a mutually doped solid solution consisting of component LiNiO2, LiCoO2, and LiMnO2, enjoying better electrochemical and thermal stability than the pristine LiNiO2. Besides, several other elements of part per million (ppm) level are chosen for doping to further stabilize the structure of the NCM materials, including magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), chromium (Cr), yttrium (Y), and gallium (Ga) [10–11]. The mechanism for improved electrochemical performance of NCM material by doping might be (1) introducing electrochemically inactive elements into the host structure, (2) preventing the undesired phase transition from the layered structure to the rock-salt-like one, and (3) promoting the lithium-ion transport due to increased lithium slab distance by the dopants. For example, Al doping improves cycling stability and thermal storage of the NCM cathode material but at the loss of capacity and rate capability. Ti doping is helpful for improved cyclability and rate capability of NCM material. Proper substitution of Cr for Mn and Y/Al for Ni can improve the cycle performance and rate capability of the materials, due to the increased lattice parameter c of the doped materials, beneficial to the diffusion of lithium ions. Most of the research on anion doping is to replace partial oxygen (O) with\n8 Development of Lithium Nickel Cobalt Manganese Oxide as Cathode Material. . . 339\nfluorine (F) [12], chlorine (Cl) [13], and sulfur (S). The strong electron absorption of F enhances the structural stability of the material, and the strong bond between lithium and fluorine also has a promoting effect on the (de)intercalation of lithium ions. The co-doping ofMg and F reduces the cationmixing and improves the cycling performance and capacity of the material.\nThe surface coating is another effective way to improve the stability of Ni-rich cathode materials. Conventionally, one or several metal oxides or phosphates of nano-sized particles are dispersed onto the surface, followed by heat treatment, such as alumina (Al2O3), titania (TiO2), ceria (CeO2), yttria (Y2O3), zirconia (ZrO2), and metal phosphate (MPO4, where M = Al, Fe, and Y) [14–20]. The mechanism of the coating for the improvement of the materials still remains a controversy. The effect of surface coating includes (1) partial isolation of the oxidizing cathode from electrolyte solution, (2) scavenging the erosive species of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in electrolyte from attacking cathode materials, (3) consuming the surface lithium impurities, and (4) surface doping enhancement due to the diffusion of the coating element into the thin surface layer with a high concentration."

      "text" : "Layer-structured cathode materials generally have surface impurities, i.e., lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and lithium hydroxide (LiOH). The higher is the Ni content, the more is the lithium impurities, nickel-rich lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide/lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (Ni-rich NCM/NCA)> nickel-poor lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (Ni-poor NCM)> lithium cobalt oxide (LCO). These impurities may cause gelation of the slurry during electrode coating process, resulting in gassing due to the decomposition of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) at high voltage, and also are severely detrimental to cell performance in terms of both capacity retention and rate capability, especially at elevated temperature.\nThe surface lithium impurities consist of two kinds of sources, residual lithium and extract lithium, respectively. The former comes from the residue of lithium in the sintering process, and the latter results from the extraction of lithium from the matrix of particles, due to the chemical instability of the Ni-rich lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide/lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide.\nWhen NCM or NCA materials are prepared, extra lithium source is added to compensate for the loss of lithium during sintering; thus after sintering, there still exists some lithium residue on the surface, in the form of lithium oxide (Li2O), at high temperature. The lithium oxide will transform to lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate when reacting with water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air. This part of surface impurities can be defined as “residual lithium impurities.” The residual lithium impurities are a kind of enrichment of the unreacted lithium on the surface, which is related to the initial Li/Me ratio, temperature profile, atmosphere, the precursor, and lithium source used.\nThe other source of surface lithium impurities is the extraction of lithium species from the matrix of the particle and further conversion to lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate, in series to the diffusion of lithium from the center to the surface layer. In a sense, lithium metal oxide (LiMeO2) can be taken as Li2O. Me2O3. In the existence of moisture and carbon dioxide, Li2O is continuously extracted out of the particle and converted to LiOH and finally to Li2CO3; this part of lithium impurities can be defined as “extractable lithium impurities.” When exposed to air, the surface residual LiOH reacts with CO2 preferentially to form Li2CO3, and LiOH content decreases quickly in several hours to a lower level, while Li2O is being extracted out and further converted to Li2CO3, even dominating the increase of the lithium impurities (Fig. 8.9). The more Li2O is extracted, the less chemical stability is the NCM material. Generally, the higher Ni content NCM is covered with higher content of lithium impurities. Single crystal NCM has lower initial lithium impurities and is comparatively stable. Precursor from different process also gives NCM of different chemical stability even with the same nickel/cobalt/manganese composition. One way to restrict the lithium species extraction is to control the content of CO2 and moisture in the atmosphere where NCM is processed. Another way is to wash NCM powders in pure water to remove the surface impurities, but the Li2O in host structure may also be rinsed away, which degrades the cycling stability especially at high temperature.\n8 Development of Lithium Nickel Cobalt Manganese Oxide as Cathode Material. . . 341"

      "text" : "From the thermodynamic point of view, the lithium-ion battery itself is an unstable high energy system, consisting of a highly oxidizing cathode, a reductive anode, and flammable organic electrolyte. Efforts should be made to improve the safety systematically, in terms of materials, cells, modules, battery pack, car design, and even application.\nThere are many factors affecting the thermal stability of cathode materials. The first factor is the composition and the structure of the materials. As is well known, the thermal stability of lithium iron phosphate and lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) is better than NCM and NCA. The Ni-low NCM materials are fairly stable compared to Ni-rich NCM counterparts. As is shown in Fig. 8.10, the heat flows of the charged NCM111, NCM523, NCM622, and NCM811 are 512.5, 605.7, 721.4, and 904.8 J.g 1, and their DSC peak temperatures are 306, 290, 264, and 232 C, respectively [4]. Accordingly, it is a possible way to improve the thermal stability of NCM with certain Ni content by increasing Mn content and lowering Co content, keeping the similar electrochemical capacity but improved thermal stability.\nIt will be helpful for improving thermal stability to properly increase the particle sizes and reduce the specific surface area of the cathode material. In general, single crystal materials naturally have an advantage stability due to the decreased surface area and surface defects.\nSuitable doping and coating can also be adopted to minimize the exothermic reaction of the delithiated cathode material, which triggers the “thermal runaway” of LIBs.\nSome case of an explosion of lithium-ion batteries has been found to be caused by metal impurities, which are unintentionally introduced during the manufacturing process of batteries and their materials. Firstly, ultra-large particles of metal scratches (Fe, Cr, Cu, and Zn) should be avoided, which might penetrate through the separator directly, resulting in internal short of the charged cathode and\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nR es\nid ua\nl l ith\niu m\n/ pp\nm\nTime/ h\nLi2CO3 LiOH Li2CO3 (from LiOH)\nFig. 8.9 Variation of lithium hydroxide (LiOH) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) contents in lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM) exposed in air\n342 Y.

Secondly, the metal impurities contaminated between particles or occluded inside the particles can be electrochemically dissolved into the electrolyte and deposited on the anode during charging, and dendrites may be formed and penetrate the separator, further cause problems of low voltage, poor safety, and short lifetime. Strict control of these metal impurities contamination should be carried out through the whole process of “raw material-cathode/anode-battery” (Fig. 8.11)."

      "heading" : "9.1 Introduction and Background",
      "text" : "The rapid depletion of fossil fuel resources and global climate changes are pushing forward the development of sustainable clean energy technologies such as advanced batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, and solar cells. Among this energy storage and conversion devices, advanced batteries are playing a significant role in human’s life. In particular, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have currently been reigning over the market for portable energy storage devices including laptops, digital cameras, mobile phones, and even more electric vehicles or grid-level stationary energy storage systems (ESSs) [1–3]. However, LIBs face the challenge of lithium shortage (Table 9.1) as a result of its abundance of only 0.0017 wt % in the Earth’s crust [4], uneven distribution, and the high extraction cost, which hamper the applications of LIBs for storage purposes. For this reason, it is highly urgent to search for alternative energy storage technologies with earth-abundant materials, low cost, high energy, and a long cycle life for large-scale energy storage applications.\nThe concerns over lithium scarcity have prompted researchers to focus on the alternative sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) system. Sodium, next to lithium in the alkali metal series, not only is more abundant (2.36 wt %) [4] and easily accessible but also possesses similar chemical properties to lithium. Based on the above advantages, SIBs have been extensively investigated [5–8]. However, the larger radius of sodium (Na+, 1.02 Å), compared with that of Li+ (0.76 Å), brings about great challenges in the development of SIBs. Research into the anode material of SIBs shows that sodium ions struggle to reversibly intercalate into graphite, thereby resulting in poor capacities [7, 9, 10]. In addition, the relatively high standard redox potential of Na+/Na ( 2.71 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) leads to a lower working voltage in contrast to that of Li+/Li ( 3.04 V vs. SHE) [11] and lower energy density than Li-ion.\nCurrently, potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have emerged as another prospective energy storage system with the ever-increasing demand for renewable resources [12–15]. Analogous to sodium, potassium is a relatively plentiful element in the Earth’s crust (2.09 wt%) [4], which can be refined with far lower cost than lithium. More importantly, potassium (K) has a relatively lower standard redox potential ( 2.93 V vs. SHE) than Na ( 2.71 V vs. SHE), suggesting a broader electrochemical operation voltage window of PIBs and thereby providing more energy. Although potassium ion has an even larger radius (1.38 Å) than that of Na+ and lithium (Li+), K+ as charge carrier has been proven to be viable. It’s more encouraging that K+ can intercalate/deintercalate into graphite layer reversibly, with an impressive capacity of more than 200 mAh g 1 [12, 16]. Furthermore, Okoshi et al. [17] revealed that K\n348 X. Qi et al.\nelectrolytes display higher conductivity than Li and Na electrolytes. They proposed the higher conductivity be ascribed to the smaller Stokes radius of solvated K+ owing to its weak Lewis acidity and the small interfacial reaction resistance originating from the lower desolvation activation energy [17]. Early studies have demonstrated higher K+ conductivity in both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes [18, 19]. Potassium carriers have been widely adopted in aqueous batteries [20, 21]. In organic electrolytes, such as ethylene carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate (DEC) solvents, K+ also show a higher ionic conductivity than Li+ and Na+. Considering these advantages, PIBs have rapidly attracted tremendous interest and gradually become a strong competitor to SIBs and even LIBs, and then varieties of materials have been developed and utilized as potential PIB electrodes.\nIn this new battery technology’s very incipient stage, the research attention should be focused on potentially scalable, industrially and economically attractive, inexpensive electrode materials and the understanding of their cycle-life-property correlations. Therefore, it is the materials scientist’s responsibility to develop novel, highperformance, and sustainable materials to cope with the challenge of providing renewable energy for large-scale energy conversion and storage devices while limiting environmental effects. Carbon-based materials are considered to be one of the most versatile materials for negative electrodes of the energy storage devices owing to their low cost, abundant sources, good chemical stability, high electrical conductivity, and environmental benignity [22, 23]. In particular, chemical stability at a wide temperature range whether in acidic or basic solution prompts carbon materials exceedingly attractive as electrodes in electrochemical energy devices. What’s more, the significance and potential of carbon-based materials have been acknowledged by some of the highest scientific field awards such as the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (fullerenes), the 2008 Kavli Prize in Nanoscience (carbon nanotubes), and the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics (graphene) [23]. As a result, interest in carbon-based materials and their applications is experiencing its most unprecedented development in modern materials science.\n9 Carbon-Based Materials for Advanced Potassium-Ion Batteries Anode 349\nIn this chapter, recent progress in carbon-based materials as anode materials of emerging nonaqueous PIBs is summarized. The class of materials is diverse and consists of graphite, graphene, hard carbon, carbon-based composites, and other carbon nanomaterials. The challenges and future research opportunities for nonaqueous PIBs are also briefly discussed."

In this section, the research on carbon-based-negative electrode materials for PIBs will be divided into four parts to be discussed in detail."

      "heading" : "9.2.1 Graphite",
      "text" : "Among all host structures, graphite has been regarded as quite remarkable. The success of the current rechargeable LIBs is mainly ascribed to the substitute of graphite for metallic Li anode, where lithium graphite (space group P63mc) intercalation compounds (GICs) can form rather than Li plating/stripping, thereby effectively avoiding dendritic lithium and offering a safe operating environment. Nowadays, graphite has been employed almost exclusively in commercialized LIBs owing to its excellent overall properties. Nevertheless, a major obstacle for the development of SIBs is that sodium can’t intercalate reversibly into graphite [25]. These phenomena are mainly related with sodium plating on the graphite surface before forming a stage I GIC [26], which has proven that sodium carbide (NaC6), the only graphite intercalation compound, was not energetically favorable from a thermodynamic perspective [27]. However, K-graphite intercalated compounds (K-GICs) have been reported in the literature in the middle of the twentieth century [28]. Potassium-graphite intercalated compounds were prepared through a non-electrochemical two-zone vapor synthesis technique or alkali metal solvation method. The vapor phase synthesis technique dates from the 1960s, which contains the heating of graphite and intercalant (Li, Na, K, etc.) in two different vessels [28]. The authors also discussed the phase transformation sequence of potassium carbide KC36–(stage III)–KC24(stage II)–KC8 (stage I) in the vapor pressure experiments. Furthermore, the energetics of alkali metal (Li, Na, and K) intercalation in graphite was compared by density functional theory (DFT) using van der Waals (vdW) density functionals [29]. Figure 9.1 demonstrates that the intercalation of Na is indeed energetically unfavorable, different from that of Li. More impressively, K intercalation is even more advantageous than that of Li. Their formation enthalpies\n350 X. Qi et al.\nfor KC8 and LiC6 are 27.5 and 16.4 kJ mol 1, respectively. These have laid a solid theoretical foundation for future research of K ion insertion into graphite even other carbon materials.\nWang and coworkers for the first time investigated reversible (de)intercalation of K+ ions into/from amorphous carbon nanofibers in 2014 [30]. The carbon nanofiber (CNF) electrode produces a first discharge capacity of 680 mA h g 1 and depotassiation capacity of about 300 mAh g 1 at a rate of 50 mAg 1. However, the specific capacity decreases to 200 mAh g 1 on the second cycle and gradually stabilizes at about 80 mAh g 1 after the 20th cycle [30], implying relatively poor cycling performance.\nJian et al. [12] reported ambient-temperature electrochemical potassium (de)intercalation into graphite with a nonaqueous electrolyte of 0.8 M KPF6 solvated in ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC). The graphite electrode presented a surprisingly high reversible depotassiation capacity of 273 mA h g 1 at C/40 (1C= 279 mAh g 1, calculated using the molecular weight of KC8 as the most potassiated phase), rather approximate to its theoretical capacity of 279 mAh g 1, the excellent performance makes graphite a potential anode material for PIBs. The K/graphite cell also produced capacities of 263, 234, 172, and 80 mA h g 1 at current densities of C/10, C/5, C/2, and 1C [12]. As a result, although graphite can display a large capacity at low current rates, its capacity fades dramatically upon higher current rates. This implies an alternative negative electrode material might be conducive to high-rate applications. Ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were also carried out to understand the structural evolution of K intercalation and the potassium storage mechanism. As shown in Fig. 9.2, the formation of several stages of K-GICs was observed. Stage III KC36, stage II KC24, and stage I KC8 were detected in a sequence upon potassiation similar to the crystallization of the phases prepared by the two-zone vapor technique [28], while depotassiation recovers from graphite through phase transformations in an opposite sequence.\nHowever, a recent study in a K/graphite half-cell proposes an unusual potassium intercalation mechanism [16]. This study coupled electrochemical measurements with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. They claim that while the intercalation occurs in three stages, the formation of stage III KC24, followed by stage II KC16, and stage I KC8 is energetically more stable than the previously proposed KC36 (stage III) to KC24 (stage II) to KC8 (stage I). Therefore, the mechanism of potassium insertion closely resembles that of lithium [16]. In order to clearly understand how the potassium intercalates into graphite, further research is urgently required.\nThe major challenge graphite faced with is the large volumetric change (60%) in the process of potassiation/depotassiation, which leads to fast capacity loss and low initial Coulombic efficiencies. Researchers have started to make efforts to choose different binders and electrolytes to alleviate the volume change to some degree. Komaba et al. [18] investigated the effect of different binders on electrochemical performance, including polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, [(C2H2F2)n]), sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMCNa, [(C2H15NaO2)n]), and sodium polyacrylate (PANa, [(C3H3NaO2)n]) for their graphite/K half-cells. As observed in Fig. 9.3, the use of\n352 X. Qi et al.\ndifferent binders causes dramatic differences in the electrochemical performance. It was revealed that higher initial Coulombic efficiencies were observed in the latter two binders for the graphite PIBs anodes compared to the PVDF binder [18]. This result was ascribed to the preformed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) effect of the binders PANa and CMCNa; thus, less potassium is consumed for the formation of SEI layer in the first discharge cycle of the PIBs.\nIn addition, Zhao et al. [31] have shown the critical effects of electrolytes on the electrochemical performance of graphite in PIBs. The authors investigated three kinds of electrolytes of 1 M potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6) in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate (EC:PC), EC/diethyl carbonate (EC:DEC), and EC/dimethyl carbonate (EC:DMC), respectively. As observed by the charge/discharge voltage profiles, graphite displayed similar reversible capacity of about 240 mAhg 1 in the first three cycles. Nevertheless, the Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability for the three electrolytes present significant difference. It was found\nthat EC:DEC (used in most PIBs literature) and EC:PC worked well with the graphite anode in comparison to EC:DMC. What’s worth mentioning is that EC: PC obtained the highest Coulombic efficiency in the first cycle among graphite in the other two electrolytes. It may arise from more severe decomposition of DEC and DMC that are not stable at a low potential.\nTo conclude, graphite is a viable and promising candidate as an anode material in PIBs. The higher average potential for K insertion into graphite as compared with Li can reduce the risk of metal plating. Even so, a more in-depth research of the material is still fairly desired so as to achieve the efficiency required from commercial batteries."

      "text" : "While research shows some promising results with graphite for negative electrodes in PIBs, other carbon materials are still needed to be explored as alternatives due to the large volume change of graphite during the cycling process. Thus, some studies have started focusing on other carbonaceous negative electrode materials.\nGraphene (space group P6/mmm) is composed of a monolayer of carbon atoms sp2 bonded into a hexagonal or honeycomb lattice sheet, which was experimentally demonstrated in 2004 [32–34]. Due to its inherent strictly two-dimensional crystal structure, graphene possesses its unique electronic, thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties. For instance, graphene shows a high surface area of 2600 m2 g 1, much larger than that of graphite (~10 m2 g 1) and carbon nanotubes (~1300 m2 g 1) [35]. Its unique electronic properties include ambipolar electric field effect, the extremely high mobility of charge carriers (~105 cm2 V 1 s 1), massless electron, and quantum Hall effects even at room temperature [36, 37]. These remarkable properties make graphene promising in applications of many various electrochemical energy systems. To date, there have been several methods to prepare graphene in the literature, such as mechanical exfoliation [33], ultrasonic cleavage [38], arc-discharge approach [39], chemical vapor deposition [40], epitaxial growth on silicon carbide (SiC) [41], thermal reduction [42, 43], and chemical reduction [44–47]. Based on a review of the current literature, it seems that thermal reduction and chemical reduction methods are the most commonly used in the preparation process of graphene-based materials in electrochemical devices. Especially, the chemical reduction of graphene oxide is one of the best-established routes to make graphene toward the large-scale production for commercial applications [48, 49].\nNanostructure design, composition fine-tuning, and doping have been proven to be effective approaches in improving the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. Considerable attention has been paid to heteroatom doping for tuning and enhancing carbons’ unique physical and chemical properties. In particular, doped carbons with well controllable porosity and the large surface area can boost its electrochemical performance. Heteroatoms such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), and fluorine (F) have been exploited to modify the surface bonding state and electron distribution of carbon architecture in order to improve their wettability and electronic conductivity [50–52]. For example, N dopant enhances positive charge density, leading to the increase of electronegativity and the acceleration of charge transfer [53]. Phosphorus doping substantially changes the local structure of hexagonal carbon due to the larger diameter of P than that of C [54]. Sulfur doping generates more defective sites and expands the interlayer distance of carbon with S generally located at the edge of the carbon layer [55]. Heteroatom doping provides a useful tool for modifying carbons’ unique physicochemical properties and further to boost ion storage performance.\nGraphene materials have been investigated as a potential negative electrode material for PIBs. Nitrogen-doped few-layer graphene (N-FLG) was grown on nickel (Ni) foam using acetonitrile in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process [56]. Electrochemical tests were performed in a half-cell vs. K+/K using CR2032 coin cells (C for ethylene carbonate, R for lithium (as anode), manganese dioxide (as cathode) and cylindrical form, 20 mm diameter, and 3.2 mm in height). N-FLG obtained an initial anodic charge (depotassiation) capacity of 350 mAh g 1 at 50 mAg 1 and remains constant over the 5 cycles at this rate. Notably, this is well beyond the theoretical capacity (279 mAh g 1) of a stage I KC8 GIC [12], close to the theoretical Li capacity in graphite of 372 mAh g 1. Galvanostatic testing\n9 Carbon-Based Materials for Advanced Potassium-Ion Batteries Anode 355\nindicates capacities for the N-FLG and FLG are 200 mAhg 1 and 30 mAh g 1 at 100 mAg 1, over six-fold improved from undoped FLG. In order to elucidate the effect of N-doping sites on the enhanced performance, the mechanism for enhanced storage in N-FLG was further examined with in situ Raman spectroscopy. In situ Raman spectroscopy is a nondestructive testing technique for exploring the electronic and structural changes in graphene and graphite and has become a powerful tool to establish the understanding of Li+ staging in carbons [57, 58]. The in situ Raman results shed light on the role of N-doping which provides active sites in the carbon lattice that can locally store K ions. Meanwhile, N-dopant sites can sustain KC8 formation and thus provide extra charge capacity [56]. This methodology enlightens the post-researchers that atomically precise fabrication of materials can be a practical avenue to optimize the performance of electrode materials for nextgeneration batteries.\nJu group have also attempted some investigations on graphene-based materials in PIBs in order to make a library of carbon-based negative electrodes. A recent study reported few-layer F-doped graphene foam (FFGF) as anode materials for both LIBs and PIBs [59]. The FFGF was prepared via high-temperature solid-state method using PVDF as a single source reactant (Fig. 9.4). Fluorine doping was introduced due to F as the most electronegative element, and the introduction of F atoms into graphene makes the carbon hybridization change from sp2 to sp3, providing a new\n356 X. Qi et al.\npossibility to modify graphene properties. Electrochemical performance of the FFGF was investigated. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) profile displays three cathodic peaks around 0.5, 0.17, and 0.05 Vas well as one rather broad anodic peak around 0.68 V during the first cycle. The peak around 0.5 V in the first cycle can be attributed to the decomposition of the electrolyte and formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film on the F-doped graphene. Then, the sharp cathodic peaks situated at 0.17 Vand 0.05 Vare correlated with the K ions intercalation into FFGF stepwise to form KC8. In the following anodic scan, the broad peak between 0.45 and 0.8 V corresponds to the deintercalation of K ions. From the second cycle onward, the 0.5 V peak disappears, which means that the SEI film mainly forms in the first cathodic process. Besides, the other cathodic/anodic peaks are almost overlapped, suggesting the high reversibility and stability. The galvanostatic cycling profile of FFGF vs. K+/K at 50 mA g 1 shows a high initial discharge and charge capacity of 863.8 and 355.6 mA h g 1, respectively. The initial Coulombic efficiency is 41.2% due to the irreversible capacity from SEI formation, but it still remained above 90% after 20 cycles. The rate cycling performance of FFGF demonstrates that this electrode delivers capacities of 326.1, 271.9, 250.7, and 212.6 mA h g 1 at current rates of 50, 100, 200, and 500 mA g 1, respectively [59]. This material appears to be rather attractive in terms of performance. So far, further work is required to understand the mechanism of K+ insertion/extraction and to adjust the functional groups on the graphene surface to attain optimum performance parameters.\nAfterward, phosphorus and oxygen dual-doped graphene (PODG) was synthesized via a thermal annealing method using triphenylphosphine (C18H15P) and graphite oxide as precursors [60]. It exhibits fairly outstanding electrochemical performance even reaching a reversible capacity of 566.6 mAh g 1 at 50 mA g 1, which is much higher than those of the other carbon anodes in PIBs [60]. The PODG electrode presents an ultralong cycling stability of 600 cycles at 2000 mA g 1 with a negligible capacity fading. Recently, few-layer nitrogen-doped graphene (FLNG) was successfully fabricated by a facile bottom-up synthesis technique with dicyandiamide and coal-tar pitch as raw materials [14]. The FLNG delivers competitive reversible capacity (320 mA h g 1 at 50 mA g 1 after 60 cycles), superior rate capability, as well as long-term cycling life at large current density (150mA h g 1 at 500 mA g 1 after 500 cycles) [14]. This superior electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the heteroatom doping, intrinsic high surface area, and enlarged interlayer distance. These structural features and their synergistic effects would promote ion and electron transportation with nanometer-scale diffusion length as well as facilitate the penetration of electrolyte, thereby leading to the superior potassium storage performance."

      "text" : "Hard carbon, also known as nongraphitizable carbon, has been chosen as the competitive anode material in SIBs or PIBs as a result of its larger interlayer spacing. Stevens and Dahn have demonstrated that hard carbon can achieve a reversible\n9 Carbon-Based Materials for Advanced Potassium-Ion Batteries Anode 357\nsodium capacity of ca. 300 mAh g 1 [61]. However, issues of hard carbon anode in SIBs are twofold: poor rate performance and the fact that the majority of its capacity is attained at sodiation potentials close to metal plating. Jian et al. [15] for the first time reported hard carbon microspheres (HCS) as an anode material for K+ storage and also compared their performance in SIBs and PIBs. Hard carbon microspheres are obtained via a hydrothermal synthesis of sucrose, followed by pyrolysis. More encouragingly, HCS shows advantageous performance for PIBs in two important respects compared with SIBs: (1) The ion-intercalation plateau region in the potential profiles of HCS in K cells is averaged at 0.2 V vs. K+/K in contrast to 0.05 V vs. Na+/Na of HCS/Na cell; this can reduce the risk of dendrite formation to a large degree in PIBs. (2) The rate capability of HCS in PIBs is much better than in SIBs. The HCS/K cells show capacities of 229, 205, 190, and 136 mAh g 1 at C/2, 1C, 2C, and 5C, respectively, while HCS/Na cells display capacities of 190, 127, 97, and 73 mAh g 1 at the same rates. In order to clarify why hard carbon exhibits a greater rate capability in PIBs than in SIBs, GITT was utilized to measure the diffusion coefficient of K-ions and Na-ions in HCS electrodes. The ionic diffusion coefficient in HCS electrodes can be determined based on Fick’s second law. The results surprisingly show that the diffusion coefficient of K-ions is slightly higher than that of Na-ions in both insertion and extraction processes (Fig. 9.5). This observation may be attributed to different binding energies between K-C and Na-C and a lower charge density of larger K-ions, which may facilitate a faster K-ion diffusion with a lower activation energy. Therefore, further studies are required to obtain the clear picture of a kinetic comparison between K+ and Na+ in carbon structures, particularly calculation and simulation.\nIn addition, Jian et al. [62] demonstrated that the limited rate capability of hard carbon spheres (HCS) and the capacity loss of soft carbon (SC) can be surmounted by synthesizing hard-soft carbon composites, integrating advantages of both materials. Furthermore, the authors replaced the commonly used polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder with sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMCNa) in the process of\n358 X. Qi et al.\nelectrode fabrication, which highly boosts the first cycle Coulombic efficiency, as it does for graphite anodes in PIBs [18]. Both HCS and HCS-SC composites exhibit much more stable cycling performance than SC, while SC and HCS-SC composites present greater rate capability than HCS. Even at 10 C, soft carbon electrode can present a high capacity of 121 mAh g 1 in contrast to 45 mAh g 1 of hard carbon. To shed light on the differences in rate capability among samples, the electronic conductivities of HCS and SC pellets were measured, which are 1.7 and 5.7 S m 1, respectively. The greater electronic conductivity of SC certainly should be responsible for its outstanding rate capability. As a consequence, it can be found that different non-graphitic carbon structures can be differentiated by their performance in K-ion storage. And it also reveals that unique non-graphitic structure with a great level of disorder along the c axis is crucial to avoid capacity loss of carbonaceous anodes in PIBs.\nAlthough these pioneering studies mentioned above achieve encouraging electrochemical results, more research should be concentrated on investigating the storage mechanisms of K+ in hard carbon, which then provides appropriate guidance to enhance the performance of hard carbon as a PIBs anode.\nRecently, Yang et al. [13] have successfully synthesized nitrogen/oxygen dualdoped hierarchical porous hard carbon (NOHPHC) applied as the anode material in PIBs by carbonizing and acidizing the NH2-MIL-101(Al) [The Materials of Institut Lavoisier is a mesoporous framework modified by amino groups which consists of super tetrahedral building units including three-dimensional octahedral clusters [Al3O] connected by 2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate linker] precursor (see Fig. 9.6). Mixed K-ion storage mechanisms, including capacitance and diffusion, were proposed, in which the capacitance plays a more critical part in its outstanding electrochemical performance. In particular, the existence of aluminum (Al) could serve as the catalyst to induce the graphitization of carbon [63], and the nitrogen- and oxygen-containing organic ligands could provide the N and O resources for the in situ heteroatom doping. Figure 9.7a, b shows the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the carbonized product of the NH2-MIL-101 (Al) precursor. It can be clearly seen that the product is comprised of uniform flower-like microspheres with sizes of ca. 2 μm, which are similar to the morphology of the NH2-MIL-101(Al) precursor. And each flower consists of plenty of primary nano-sized “petals” with thicknesses of tens of nanometers. After further removing the metal or metal oxides in the carbonized product by acid treatment, the obtained\n9 Carbon-Based Materials for Advanced Potassium-Ion Batteries Anode 359\nNOHPHC is composed of abundant mesoporous channels and mesopores, which could produce large amounts of defect sites to facilitate ion and electron transport. The NOHPHC electrode exhibits the high initial discharge and charge capacities of 1261 and 315 mA h g 1 at a current density of 50 mAg 1, respectively. The low\nCoulombic efficiency of 25% can be ascribed to the formation of the SEI layer on the surface of the NOHPHC. For one thing, the electrolyte used in the PIBs could be responsible for this low efficiency; for another thing, the hierarchical porous structure and the high specific surface area may also lead to the low initial efficiency and slow capacity stabilization, which need more time for the complete formation of the SEI layer. Rate performance measurements were also carried out (Fig. 9.7d). It shows the NOHPHC obtained capacities of ca. 365 and 315 mAh g 1 at 25 and 50 mA g 1, respectively. And even at a high current density of 3000 mA g 1, a capacity of 118 mAh g 1 can be maintained with a capacity retention of 33%. When the current density is restored to 25 mA g 1, the reversible capacity nearly returns to its initial capacity which indicates the superior rate capability of the electrode. The electrode also achieved outstanding long-term cycling stability at 1050 mA g 1 for 1100 cycles. The capacity of the electrode fades from 174 to 130 mAh g 1 in the first 300 cycles, while only 4% capacity loss and nearly 100% efficiency occur in the subsequent cycles. The capacity fading in the first 300 cycles may be attributed to the fact that the fingerprint-like twisted structure was destroyed by the strain that is relevant to the intercalation of large K ions. The adsorption mechanism for capacity could account for the excellent cycling stability in the subsequent cycles. It is because of the superior rate capacity and excellent cycling performance of the NOHPHC electrode that the authors are determined to explore the contribution of two mechanisms, the surface-induced capacitive process and diffusion-controlled intercalation process, in the insertion/extraction of K+ qualitatively and quantitatively, respectively. Figure 9.7e illustrates the mixed mechanisms of potassium-ion storage. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that both capacitance and diffusion are responsible for the excellent K-ion storage, in which capacitance accounts for the majority of the superb electrochemical performance. It will provide a useful guide on the relationship between K-ion storage mechanisms and electrochemical properties for the carbonaceous anode."

      "text" : "Metals or nonmetals that undergo alloying reactions and store alkali metals are among the most appealing anode candidates for high-energy rechargeable batteries because they offer much higher capacities than the commercially employed graphite anodes. Lithium is known to form alloys (LixM) with various metals and nonmetals such as magnesium (Mg), Al, silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), P, and antimony (Sb). For instance, the theoretical Li storage capacity is up to 4200 mA h g 1 for Si, 2959 mA h g 1 for P, 1600 mA h g 1 for Ge, and 990 mA h g 1 for Sn, respectively [64, 65]. In spite of the high theoretical capacity, the practical application of these alloy-based anode materials is still a vast challenge. A critical barrier that restricts the commercialization of these alloy-based anodes is that they suffer from intense capacity loss upon cycling. One commonly accepted reason is the aggregation and pulverization of active materials caused by severe volume changes. To date, numerous efforts have been devoted to tackling the intrinsic problem, and significant\n9 Carbon-Based Materials for Advanced Potassium-Ion Batteries Anode 361\nprogress has been achieved. The strategies for improving the performance of alloytype anodes mainly concentrate on engineering rational nanostructures and introducing conductive carbon substrate, both of which can effectively lead to the faster reaction kinetics and alleviate capacity decay.\nSo far, alloy-based anode materials in PIBs have also gradually drawn researchers’ interest in terms of their high theoretical capacities and effective strategies toward large volume variation. McCulloch et al. demonstrated that nano-sized antimony carbide (Sb-C) composites exhibited an initial discharge capacity of ca. 880 mAh g 1 at a current density of 35 mAg 1 [66]. Especially, carbon can serve both as an efficient conductive pathway and a buffer layer to mitigate the large volume change of Sb during the cycling process. Due to the occurrence of some side reactions and SEI formation on the surface of the electrodes, the capacity of 880 is irreversible. Sb reversibly alloys with K upon the subsequent cycles, forming cubic K3Sb with a capacity of 650 mAh g 1.\nPhosphorus (P) possesses a high theoretical capacity of 2595 mAh g 1 because it can form potassium phosphide (K3P), a binary phase with K [67]. However, the low electrical conductivity and large volume changes limit its further application. In order to restrain the inherent volume expansion of phosphorus during the charge and discharge process, the phosphorus/carbon (P-C) composites are synthesized by a simple mechanical ball-milling as an anode for PIBs. The P-C electrode presents the first discharge and charge capacity of 958.9 and 482.9 mA h g 1, respectively, and a low initial Coulombic efficiency of 50.3% [68]. It still maintained a rather high charge capacity of 323.5 mAh g 1 after 50 cycles at a rate of 50 mA g 1. The outstanding electrochemical performance is mainly ascribed to a structural transformation from red P to black P and the formation of the stable P-C bond, mitigating the dramatic volume expansion upon cycling effectively. Pre-potassiation treatment was carried out to boost the low initial coulomb efficiency. The authors also conducted the X-ray diffraction characterization to further elucidate the K-ion storage mechanism. And it was found that a KP phase was detected during the alloying-de-alloying process.\nSn, as a well-known alloy anode material, has been massively studied for LIBs and SIBs. Tin (Sn) is capable of forming Li4.4Sn and Na15Sn4 alloys reversibly in these cells and displaying theoretical capacities of 991 and 845 mA h g 1, respectively [64, 69]. When utilized as PIBs anode materials, the results show that an Sn atom can accept only one K atom to form KSn alloy with a capacity of 226 mA h g 1. Due to the large volume changes (~197%) during the cycling process, the electrochemical performance of pure Sn is unsatisfactory as reported in previous work [70]. A common strategy to conquer this problem is to prepare Sn-carbon composites in which Sn nanoparticles are mixed with or dispersed in a carbon component. Sultana et al. [71] reported that ball-milled Sn-graphite nanocomposite anodes for PIBs delivered a capacity of 150–170 mAh g 1 for 10–15 cycles at 25 mA g 1 within the potential window of 0.01–2 V with 0.75 M KPF6 in a mixture of EC and DEC electrolyte. Ex situ XRD characterization indicates K2Sn5 and K4Sn23 are the likely potassiated phases. Zhang et al. [72] reported the electrochemical performance of ball-milled phosphorous/carbon (P/C) and tin phosphide/carbon (Sn4P3/C)\n362 X. Qi et al.\ncomposites as anode materials for K-ion storage. The P-C electrode produced over 2000 and 1000 mAh g 1 for the first two charge cycles, followed by a sudden capacity loss, only with a retention of 9% of the capacity after 20 cycles. In contrast, the electrochemical performance of the Sn4P3/C composite is more encouraging. The Sn4P3/C electrode displayed superior rate capability: 385 mAh g\n1 and 222 mAh g 1 at 50 mA g 1 and 1 A g 1, respectively. More importantly, this alloy anode retained a capacity of over 300 mAh g 1 after 50 cycles. A two-step reaction helping to buffer the stress was proposed for K+ storage (Fig. 9.8), which explains the improved electrochemical performance clearly.\nVery recently, Ju group also make some efforts in C@M (M= Sn, Sb) composites as anode materials for K-ion storage [73, 74]. Three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous carbon/Sn (HPCS) composite was synthesized by in situ generated sodium chloride (NaCl) crystals as templates, followed by calcination at three different temperatures. The thickness of the 3D network of carbon ultrathin films is only several nanometers. The Sn nanoparticles are uniformly distributed in the inner surface of hierarchically porous carbon materials and preserve the structure and interface well, leading to a highly reversible electrochemical reaction. Obviously, the 3D hierarchically porous framework could provide efficient space for K+ storage and fast pathways for K+ transportation. Electrochemical results showed that HPCS-650 exhibited both high capacity and excellent cyclability. To be specific, the electrode at 650 C obtained a first charge and discharge capacity of 847.9 mAh g 1 and 384.5 mAh g 1 at 50 mAg 1. Moreover, the electrode still maintained a reversible capacity of about 276.4 mAh g 1 for 100 cycles steadily with a Columbic efficiency of more than 96%. However, the sample at lower carbonization temperature (450 C) didn’t display relatively more superior performance than that of other samples. The reason may be that the lower degree of graphitization gives rise to poor conductivity and K+ meet greater hindrance in the ion transfer process. In order to elucidate the Sn and K alloying process, the authors focus on the analysis of the third cycle of the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles and propose the reversible alloying and conversion reaction mechanisms. These can be summarized as the following equations:\n9 Carbon-Based Materials for Advanced Potassium-Ion Batteries Anode 363\n23Snþ 4K $ K4Sn23 (9:1) K4Sn23 þ K $ K2Sn5 (9:2) 8Cþ Kþ þ e $ KC8 (9:3)\nAntimony nanoparticles uniformly embedded in the 3D porous carbon synthesized by similar methods have also been shown to offer high discharge capacities, superior rate capability, and relatively stable cycle life for K-ion storage [73]. Apparently, some metal alloying systems have displayed promising performance for K+ storage; meanwhile, the large volume changes of K alloying reactions will pose challenges and should be further evaluated.\nCompared to unsustainable carbon resources, biomass can serve as a renewable resource to prepare carbon electrodes for the applications of electrochemical energy storage [75]. It’s reported that biomass carbon materials have been extensively applied as anode materials in LIBs and SIBs [76–78]. Similar to the findings reported for Li and Na, this class of materials also have been proven to intercalate K successfully. For example, some waste or scrap materials derived from seafood waste (chitin) [79], waste tires [80], or pencils [81] can be explored as carbon anodes for K+ storage. The idea that biowaste materials are recycled to synthesize anodes for PIBs is interesting but instructive and conducive to the sustainable development of the whole society."

Since the intercalation of potassium ions into graphite anodes has been demonstrated to be feasible, researchers have successively conducted more investigations on other carbon anode materials; meanwhile, some advancements have been achieved. However, the research on nonaqueous PIBs is still in its infancy stage; there are some challenges to be surmounted for the future development and practical applications of this new battery chemistry, including but not limited to (1) understanding of the storage mechanisms and kinetics of K ions during the intercalation reactions; (2) focus on understanding of the SEI layer, its relationship to the electrolytes/additives used, and the mechanism of formation and growth; (3) the optimization of current electrolyte and binder systems to make it compatible and efficient; and (4) underlying safety hazards due to more chemically reactive K than Li and Na. There is still a long winding road to fulfilling viable performance of emerging PIBs for practical applications. Overall, carbon-based materials are the most prospective electrode candidate materials for the future practical applications of PIBs.

      "text" : "Commercial lithium-ion batteries (265 Wh/kg) provide 6.5 more energy than lead acid and more than 2 that of nickel-metal hydride (NiMH). These large gains in energy density have ushered in the wide proliferation of portable electronics and the commercialization of long-range personal electric vehicles. Car manufacturing companies such as Tesla and Volkswagen propose that large-scale production of electric vehicles will lower the battery pack cost to $100/kWh (currently around $150/kWh). Such large-scale projects have already started and will be more prevalent by 2020. However, the success of the electric vehicle hinges on the safety, durability, and lifetime of the battery pack. These characteristics are critically important because the lithium-ion battery operates outside its electrochemical stability window. During\nC. B. Bucur (*) Toyota Research Institute of North America, Ann Arbor, MI, USA e-mail: claudiu.b.bucur@outlook.com\n© Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2019 Q. Zhen et al.

The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the electrolyte is below the Fermi level of the anode, and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the electrolyte lies above the Fermi level of the cathode. In addition, cathode discharge products may have increased solubility in the electrolyte and may be lost during cycling. Thus, battery lifetime is governed by the degree with which these undesired reactions are mitigated. For example, the proper choice of electrolyte solvents and additives form a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the graphite anode. This thin layer of solid electrolyte is not electrically conductive, so it stops further decomposition of the electrolyte, but it allows the permeation of lithium cations (Li+) such that battery can continue to operate. The commercial assembly process of lithium-ion batteries contains lithium in the cathode. The graphite anode is delithiated at the time of cell fabrication, so the battery is assembled in its discharged state. The electrochemically catalyzed selfassembly of the SEI during initial formation cycles irreversibly consumes lithium from the cathode which requires careful balancing of the electrodes by loading with excess cathode material. As a result, this practice reduces the energy density of the battery. In addition, the SEI decomposes at temperatures above 60 C which further reduces the energy density due to the need for additional temperature management infrastructure. Similar chemistry occurs at the cathode.\nElectrodes assembled with preformed stable interfaces may improve the cell energy density since no excess would be required at the cathode. Popular strategies for improving the interface stability of electrodes include various vapor/vacuum deposition of thin oxide layers and thin polymeric coatings. It is desirable that such coatings (1) increase the stability of the electrolyte at the electrode interface, (2) reduce dissolution of soluble species, (3) are thin enough as to not significantly increase cell impedance, and (4) are applied in a simple, fast, and cheap manner. When applied, such coatings can extend the cycle life of the battery and may allow for stability at higher charge voltages with corresponding increases in extracted capacity during discharge. In addition, advanced lithium-ion cathodes such as lithium-rich and nickel-rich cathodes also benefit from such stable coatings with reported increases in cycle life. Battery safety can also be improved by coatings applied to common polypropylene separators. In the catastrophic event of a thermal runaway, cell temperature can quickly rise above 160 C which irreversibly shrinks commercial separators and exposes the electrodes to electric shorts. Ceramic and polymer-coated separators have been demonstrated to have improved thermal stabilities and conductivities of lithium cations and superior wettability by electrolyte solvents. The economic implementation of such coatings may foster the commercialization of advanced lithium-ion batteries with up to 20% improvement in energy density at the cell level (up to 315 Wh/kg). Over time, such advanced technology may mature to offer >10,000 cycles which may foster the introduction of electric drivetrains for vehicles used in commercial platforms (such as carrier trucks, USPS, etc.) with grueling nonstop schedules of operations. There are only a handful of batteries which go beyond lithium-ion. They commonly replace graphite anodes with alloying and ultimately pure metallic anodes (lithium, sodium, or magnesium)\n370 C. B. Bucur\nand pair them with cheap, high energy density cathodes such as sulfur or oxygen. While the challenges of these batteries are more numerous and more difficult to solve than those of lithium-ion, they also benefit from thin polymeric coatings to impede dissolution of discharge intermediates (sulfur is the typical example), to construct highly conductive electrode matrices, or to reign in the uncontrollable dendritic deposition of metallic lithium or sodium. As such, a lithium-sulfur battery may offer up to 3 gains in energy density (760 Wh/kg). These future, post-lithium-ion batteries may usher in the age of the long-range electric plane. For reference, an electric Tesla Model S 85 vehicle has an overall energy density of 40 Wh/kg and an average cruising power usage of 10 W/kg (C/4 operation), whereas a Cessna 172 airplane has an overall energy density of 470 Wh/kg with an average cruising power usage of 80 W/kg (if electric, C/6 operation). A rate of C corresponds to complete discharge or charge in 1 h; C/4 corresponds to full discharge in 4 h. Comprehensive reviews for the use of polymeric coatings in batteries have been published in the past 5 years [18, 25, 34, 63, 94]. The following chapter will focus on cutting edge advances in the past 3 years. Part 2 of the chapter will focus on simple polymeric coatings based on template polymerization of spin coating addition, and part 3 will demonstrate the advantages offered by the layer-by-layer multilayer technique."

      "text" : "Stabilizing films which form in situ during battery operation consist in part of polymerized solvent or additive components. Common electrode-coating techniques include vapor deposition such as atomic layer deposition of stable oxides such as aluminum oxide (Al2O3). While this technique can control the adsorbed thickness to anatomically specified thickness, it is very slow (1 Å per cycle) and very expensive (half a million dollar instrument cost). Similarly, thin coatings can be quickly and cheaply applied from polymer solutions. The challenge is to obtain conformal and thin polymeric coatings as the most desirable conductive polymers, such as polyaniline (PANI), a mixture of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) ionomers, polyacetylenes (PAC), polyphenylenes, or polypyrroles (PPY), contain conjugated double bonds and are not truly soluble in any solvent. They may, however, form good dispersions in some solvents. Table 10.1 lists many of the polymers of interest reported here."

However, other batteries with a lithium metal anode have not gained wide marketplace acceptance due to safety considerations. Several recent reports suggest that lithium metal plates smoothly from gel polymer or polymer electrolytes. Byon et al. constructed a lithium-iodine battery with a high energy density of 330Wh/kg by pairing a high-concentration aqueous iodine solution with a water-stable solid electrolyte lithium aluminum titanium phosphate (Li1+x+3zAlx(Ti, Ge)2 xSi3zP3 zO12) (LATP) with a lithium-stable gel polymer electrolyte bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI)/N-methyl-N-propylpiperidinium (PP13) based on polyethylene oxide (PEO) (PEO20/LiTFSI/PP13TFSI/SiO2) [103]. The gel polymer electrolyte is stable up to 200 C, forms a stable interface with lithium metal, and promotes smooth deposition/dissolution at the anode. The total conductivity was 0.7 mS/cm at 55 C, and a stable capacity of 200 mAh/g is reported with a flat plateau at 3.5 V (Fig. 10.1). The rate of operation was 1 mA/cm2. For reference, typical rates of operation for commercial lithium-ion cells (Panasonic NCR18650B) at C/3 rates are 1.7 mA/cm2 at room temperature. A similar approach of controlling the lithium metal anode was reported by Goodenough et al. who used a lithium fluoride (LiF)-enhanced garnet solid electrolyte lithium lanthanum titanate (Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12)-(LLZT-LiF) and a cross-linked PEO/LiTFSI polymer electrolyte with a melting point of 240 C to control the lithium metal anode [54]. With a conductivity of 0.5 mS at room temperature, lithium/LLZT/lithium iron phosphate (Li/gel/LLZT/LiFePO4) and Li/gel/LLZT/sulfur batteries were constructed and cycled with a real capacity of 1 mAh/cm2 (Fig. 10.1) and at rates of 0.2 mA/cm2. The lithium-sulfur battery observed no capacity decay over 100 cycles with 1000 mAh/g capacities.\nNafion and polyvinylidene were cast-coated in sequence on a lithium metal foil in a lithium-sulfur battery with a liquid electrolyte. This paper by Luo et al. reports that these thin coatings result in smooth plating (Fig. 10.2) of lithium at the anode [59]. The resulting polymeric membrane had a density of 0.2 mg/cm2 and is 3 μm\nTable 10.1 (continued)\nChitosan\nPolydopamine (PDA)\nPoly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), bis-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEDOT-PEG)\n376 C. B. Bucur\nthick. 100 cycles are reported with 700 mAh/g capacities and corresponding areal capacities of 1 mAh/cm2. For reference, commercial lithium-ion cells can transfer 5.5 mAh of lithium per cm2. Due to the lower voltage of a lithium-sulfur battery, it is required that even higher capacities in excess of 10 mAh have to be transferred per cm2. In addition, direct coatings of lithium metal from solutions of polymers are problematic because there are no ideal solvents which are stable on lithium metal and can dissolve the desired polymers. For example, N,N-dimethylacetamide has been used in this work; however, acetamides are known to react strongly to lithium metal. Kim et al. in collaboration with Hyundai Motor Corp. have reported that poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-co-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEDOT-PEG) can be spin cast directly on lithium metal from a nitromethane solution. In addition, dispersing aluminum fluoride (AlF3) particulates in the PEDOT-PEG solution improves the smooth plating and stability of the lithium metal anode [43, 75]. Figure 10.2 shows the morphology of the lithium metal anode after cycling on an unprotected and a protected anode.\nA highly viscoelastic self-healing polymer with a low glass transition temperature (Tg) of 26 C was spin coated on lithium metal foils to form 1:1 solutions in chloroform and ethanol by Zheng et al. in collaboration with BASF [105]. Figure 10.3 shows the polymer structure and elasticity. This polymer is highly stretchable because of the presence of weaker hydrogen bonding cross-links in\nthe structure. While spin coating minimizes the exposure of lithium metal to ethanol, it is not a scalable procedure. For example, solution spraying would be more desirable for large lithium foils, but prolonged exposure of lithium to ethanol would yield in rapid lithium corrosion. New solubility properties are required for direct coating of lithium by polymers. 1 mAh/cm2 of lithium has been deposited at rates as fast as 5 mA/cm2 with very smooth, planar deposits (Fig. 10.3).\nSodium metal is also a desirable anode because it is orders of magnitude more commonplace in the earth crust and has been historically cheaper than lithium. Unfortunately, it also deposits uncontrollably due to its high reactivity with traditional liquid electrolytes. Sodium metal has been controlled in a report by Gao et al. by the use of a low-cost gel polymer/glass fiber composite which acts as stable sodium interface as well as electrolyte/separator for the sodium salt [24]. The gel is composed of glass fiber mixed with polydopamine (PDA)-coated polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) which is stable to 200 C mixed with sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) in propylene carbonate. A conductivity of 4.25 mS/cm at room temperature is reported. The composite is sandwiched between electrodes and pressed in coin cells. Stable cycling is reported\nfor sodium metal with a sodium manganese ferrocyanide [Na2MnFe(CN6)] cathode at a slow rate of 0.2 mA/cm2. Only 0.2 mAh/cm2 is deposited at the sodium anode on each charge cycle. Gel-type polymers used as separators have also been shown to improve overcharge protection in lithium metal/LiCoO2 cells by Ni et al. [65]. As such, 100% overcharge on each cycle does not reduce the stable discharge of 150 mAh/g of a LiCoO2 cathode for over 50 cycles when a PVDF membrane is mixed with a heat-resistant silicone-capped electroactive polyfluorene. Poly [9,9-di-(20-ethylhexyl)fluorenyl-2,7-diyl] is endcapped with polysilsesquioxane cages. This polymer gel also forms a stable interface with a lithium metal anode. Heat-resistant, UV-curable polysilsesquioxane modifications of polypropylene (PP) separators were reported by Na et al. to promote the cycling of lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) with metallic lithium [64] presumably due to an increase of the separator’s elastic modulus. Stable plating of 2 mAh/cm2 lithium for 250 cycles was reported to correspond to the graphene modified polyethylene (PE) separator [74]. The graphene nanosheets were co-doped with nitrogen and sulfur to induce an electrostatic interaction between the lithium metal foil and the graphene-coated separator. This interaction presumably lowered the surface tension of lithium metal and promotes smooth plating."

      "text" : "Other advanced anodes consist of graphite/silicon mixtures, alloying metals such as tin (Sn) or bismuth (Bi), and high-capacity metal oxides. For reference, lithiated graphite anodes have a limited capacity of 340 mAh/g, and a long cycle life can typically be obtained at low charging rates of>2 h (C/2). In addition, they require electrolytes which tend to gel at low temperatures and preclude their use in cold climates without temperature management. Polymeric coatings have been used to tame the large volume changes which typically plague the cycle life of these anodes. Sun et al. reported a stretchable, self-healing polymer to coat carbon/silicon anodes and obtain 100 stable cycles with a capacity of 800 mAh/g or 0.8 mAh/cm2 [78]. Tin (Sn) anodes are highly desirable due to intermediate volume expansion between charge and discharge and high cyclability. PEO-coated Sn particles were reported to result in a more stable SEI during battery operation by Cao group [6]. Jiang et al. reported that polydopamine-coated SnO2 particles can cycle stably for 300 cycles with capacities >600 mAh/g at C/3 rates [38]. Dou group reported that when Sn/Ni bimetallic nanotube arrays are coated by PEO, the interface with the electrolyte is stabilized and 200 stable cycles are obtained with capacities >800 mAh/g or 0.3 mAh/cm2 [19]. Transition metal oxides are also promising anode materials plagued by the rapid capacity fade. Jin et al. demonstrated that polypyrrole-coated manganese/iron oxides [MnOx/Fe2O3] display excellent electrochemical properties [39]. 100 stable cycles offer 1000 mAh/g."

      "text" : "Battery separators have the important role of denying direct electrical contact between anode and cathode and forcing the flow of electrons through an outside circuit which is used to do work on a load. The flow of electrons through the outside circuit is balanced inside the battery cell by the migration of cations (e.g., Li+) between electrodes such that the electrode charge is always neutral. For example, a loss of electrons (oxidation) is neutralized by an equimolar loss of cations. It is crucial for battery operation that the separator is thin and light and does not significantly reduce the ionic conductivity of the cell. It should also be stable over wide temperatures (it should not shrink) and potential ranges (it should not react with the electrodes). Commercial separators typically consist of polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PP) sheets, 9–30 μm thick with 40–90% porosities and good wettability by a liquid electrolyte.\nAlternative separators. A variety of alternative separators have been recently reported to be constructed as interlayer freestanding composites of inorganic (or carbonaceous) compounds suspended in polymeric matrices. Zhai group reported a closely packed -polyethylene glycol diacrylate ( -PEGDA) dip-coated onto electrospun polyetherimide/polyvinylidene (PEI/PVDF) membranes [99]. This separator has improved wettability and thermal stability as compared to commercial (Celgard) separators. An ultrathin single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)/polyacrylic acid (PAA) interlayer has been reported by Kim\n380 C. B. Bucur\ngroup [42] to improve the trapping of polysulfides and the cycle life of a lithiumsulfur battery with 2 mAh/cm2 capacity (700 mAh/g sulfur) for 200 cycles. The thickness of the interlayer was 7 μm and it weighed 0.8 mg/cm2. Zhou et al. reported the assembly of a flexible sulfur-graphene-polypropylene (PP) separator for lithium-sulfur batteries [106]. In this approach, graphene/PVDF slurry is coated onto one side of the PP separator using a slot coating machine. Silica glass films were prepared onto the surface of Celgard PP separators by impregnating a perhydropolysilazane solution in xylene for 10 min [33]. Upon heating at 100 C, the polymer dries into silica glass films conformally coating the Celgard PP separator weaves. The modified separator is heat-resistant and does not shrink at 160 C while maintaining the same rate of battery operation as the untreated commercial polypropylene (PP) separator. Another popular alternative Li+conductive separator/polymeric electrolyte is based on nonwoven polyvinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP). Shi group reported a polydopamine (PDA)-coated PVDF-HFP membrane which does not shrink even at 200 C and has better wettability than commercial polypropylene separators [73]. The coating process is simple in aqueous solutions and consists of electrostatic interactions between the charged PDA and PVDF-HFP fibers. Seider group proposed the spraying of PVDF-HFP fibers complexed with ether-modified polysiloxanes [72]. Improvements are observed in terms of electrolyte uptake and increased ionic transport. The separator solution can be sprayed directly onto the electrode, resulting in a thin separator. An interesting approach was that of Ding group who coated PVDF-HFP fibers with a polymeric tartaric acid borate polyelectrolyte (PLTB) which results in improved thermal resistance at 150 C and improved conductivity and strength [17]. A polyionic liquid separator based on a thiazolium polycation and a (bis)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI ) anion has been reported by Grygiel group to have an improved transfer coefficient for Li+ and better conductivity [30]. It has been demonstrated to work with lithium-ion batteries.\nModifications of commercial separators. Commercial polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) separators can be modified by conformal coatings which improve the thermal stability, wettability, and conductivity. Xu group reported an aqueous coating of PP separators with a suspension of polyvinylidene (PVDF) particles and the polyelectrolyte polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [89]. This is achieved by simple dipping. This coating improves heat resistance, and no shrinking is observed at temperatures of 130 C (Fig. 10.4). The polyelectrolyte PVA also improves the electrolyte uptake and wettability of the separator (Fig. 10.4). Pan et al. coats PP separators with tannic acid, which is a naturally occurring polyphenol [68]. The coating process takes place in water at pH 7 and results in dramatic improvements in electrolyte uptake. Another approach to improve the poor wettability of PP separators has been that reported by Wang et al. who used pyrogallic acid, which is cheaper than similar agents such as dopamine [81]. Lia et al. proposed the use of a cellulose aerogel and a polydopamine substrate to coat PP separators with aims at improving the thermal stability and shrink resistance at 150 C [55]. Hwang group coated a PP separator with a polymerized ionic liquid based on 1-[(4-etheneylphenyl)methyl]-3-butylimidazolium chloride\n10 New, Game-Changing Applications of Polymer-Based Coatings in Battery 381\n(EBIC) and 1-[(4-ethenylphenyl)methyl]-3-butylimidazolium hydroxide (EBIH) [35]. Improved wettability is reported. Commercial polyethylene separator also exists, especially sandwiched between PP layers to afford a shutdown mechanism at high temperatures. The melting point of PE is lower than that of PP, and once it melts, its pores close and effectively shut down the flow of ions between electrodes. Zhang group has used polydopamine to coat a PP/PE/PP commercial separator to improve polysulfide retention in a lithium-sulfur battery [101]. The coating can be assembled in an aqueous solution. Polysulfide trapping can be visualized in Fig. 10.4. Han group has grafted a PE separator induced by atmospheric plasma with charged polymers such as polyvinyl sulfonate (PVS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) which induce an improved ionic flux of Li+ to and from the electrode and improve conductivities and electrolyte wettability and reduce shrinking at 134 C [32].\nFlow battery separators. Separators are also crucial in flow batteries which utilize liquid anodes (anolytes) and cathodes (catholytes) flown over a selective membrane which would only allow the transfer of a single cation. A commercial flow battery is based on vanadium solutions. The challenge in this field is that in addition to the diffusion of the desired ion, there also occurs the diffusion of undesired ions which reduces the efficiency and cycle life of the battery. Xi group reported the polydopamine (PDA) coating of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) separators which improves stability in highly oxidative vanadium electrolytes, higher mechanical strength, as well as reduced vanadium ion permeability [86]. Figure 10.5 displays the improved cycle life of a vanadium battery with a PDA/SPEEK separator membrane. Yuan group reported improved selectivity of a poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membrane separator upon spraying with zeolite flakes [98]. Zeolites are ion-conductive crystalline aluminosilicates with pore sizes between 0.3 and 1 nm which may function well in separator applications. Gong group [28] and Cho group [12] report the coating of urushi fibers with the charged polymers chitosan and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC). Urushi is a natural polymer with high mechanical robustness, and the polyelectrolytes impart ionic selectivity. The result is a promising alternative to traditional separator membranes for redox flow batteries"

      "text" : "Simple polymeric coatings have been used to improve the operation of cathodes for lithium-ion, advanced lithium-ion, and post-lithium-ion batteries. Their use has two main targets. (1) First is the stable interface of advanced high-voltage cathodes with electrolytes and reducing electrolyte denaturation at that interface. (2) Second is the reduction of soluble species loss during cycle life such as soluble metal ions or polysulfides.\nLithium-ion. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT: PSS) has been used to coat LiFePO4 active material particles. 4% dispersion of this conductive polymer to the active mass of LiFePO4 leads to a 30% improvement in capacity (160 mAh/g) [21]. Similarly, a coating of lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) active material with cross-linked PAN outperforms popular alumina (Al2O3) coatings in cycle life experiments [95]. Lee group reported the coating of lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2) (NCM622) cathode active\nmaterial with Al2O3/PEDOT-co-PEG polymer [48]. This protective layer inhibited the dissolution of Ni, Co, and Mn metals and improved thermal stability by suppressing direct contact between the electrolyte and delithiated NCM. Figure 10.6 shows the improved cycle life at 55 C and increased thermal stability of Al2O3/PEDOT-co-PEG-coated NCM622.\nA perchlorate anion (ClO4 )-doped polypyrrole (Ppy) coating is reported to improve the cycle life of sodium manages ferrocene [Na1+xMnFe(CN)6] sodium cathodes [52]. The conductive Ppy coating acts as a barrier to loss of Mn in the electrolyte and allows operation of the electrode at very high rates (46C or full discharge in 78 s). 200 cycles are reported at 90 mAh/g and a rate of C/10.\nAdvanced lithium-ion. Lithium- and nickel-rich cathode materials hold the promise of improving the capacity of cathodes from a current maximum of ~180 to 250 mAh/g. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) polymer was used to coat lithium-rich-layered oxides such as Li1.17Mn0.56Co0.09Ni0.175O2 [46]. While the precise mechanism for capacity fade in lithium-rich materials is still a matter of intense debate, polymer coatings have been shown to suppress the growth of blocking layers over cycling. Wu group has also used PEDOT:PSS surface particle coatings to improve the cycle life of lithium-rich Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 [85]. Another class of cheap advanced lithium-ion cathode is vanadium compounds which can intercalate multiple lithiums per unit structure. Lithium vanadium phosphate [Li3V2(PO4)] is gathering significant interest; however it is limited by poor electronic conductivity. Coating of active material particles with PEDOT:PSS improves the electronic\n384 C. B. Bucur\nconductivity of the material allowing stable cycling at a fast rate of 3C [93]. 500 cycles offered 120 mAh/g or 0.3 mAh/cm2.\nPost-lithium-ion. A sulfur cathode is one of the most promising post-lithium-ion cathodes due to its low cost and high capacity (5 higher than currently used NCM or NCA cathodes). A sulfur cathode has two main challenges. (1) Sulfur is an insulator and requires large amounts of conductive additives which makes it very difficult to assemble into thick electrodes. (2) Discharge intermediates called polysulfides dissolve and are lost in the electrolyte reducing cycle life. Both of these challenges can be mitigated by utilizing polymeric coatings. In an attempt to achieve high sulfur loadings, a conductive and robust biopolymer network built from guar gum (GG) and xanthan gum (XG) binder which contain large ratios of oxygen-containing functional groups can trap polysulfides [57]. An impressive 800 mAh/g or 9.5 mAh/cm2 is obtained over 60 stable cycles in a lithium-sulfur cell at a rate of C/6. Cycle life is limited by the effect of lithium metal anode when large capacities such as these are extracted. Lim group reported a copper-anchored cross-linked PEO polymer-coated sulfur electrode which improves the cycle life [56]. High rate cycling of 100 cycles at 2C is reported for this sulfur cathode. Conductive PEDOT:PSS coatings have been reported by Lee group to improve sulfur cathodes [45]. In this example, commercial sulfur is coated by the polymer in water/ethanol mixtures, followed by drying. A similar approach was taken by Li group who doctor bladed a Sigma Aldrich suspension of 1.3% aqueous PEDOT: PSS onto a precast pure sulfur cathode [53]. Improvements are observed over untreated sulfur in both cases. A unique approach to a sulfur cathode was taken by Zhou group who used vanadium tetrasulfide (VS4) as the source of sulfur. VS4 microspheres were sequentially coated by PEDOT/PPY/PANI [107]. This conductive coating activated more of the available capacity and inhibited the loss of soluble polysulfides. Another sequential coating of sulfur particles has been reported by Yan group who coats sulfur cores with PEDOT, then with MnO2 [92]. This approach provides improved electrolyte penetration into the cathode and 200 stable cycles at 800 mAh/g at C/5. Figure 10.7 shows the schematic of the coating as well as the cycle life.\nA poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/carbon-based multifunctional polysulfide blocking layer was electrosprayed on a sulfur electrode. 1000 cycles are reported with an average capacity of 500 mAh/g or 1 mAh/cm2 [66]. A graphene/PANI/sulfur-layered composite has been investigated as a sulfur cathode by Moon group [62]. The layered structure is held together by cross-linking the PANI layer. 500 cycles are reported with a capacity of 900 mAh/g at a rate of 1C. A similar graphene/PANI approach was used to build selenium coreshell fibers which can cycle for 200 cycles with a near theoretical capacity of 600 mAh/g or 1.8 mAh/cm2 [100]."

      "text" : "While simple polymeric coatings often improve the performance of battery materials, there is a dedicated method used for adhering polymers to surfaces which was first reported by Decher [14]. This layer-by-layer (LBL) method utilizes charged\n10 New, Game-Changing Applications of Polymer-Based Coatings in Battery 385\nmoieties on polymer backbones to form ionic pairs or cross-links with substrates or additional polymeric layers. By this method, a polymer-polymer link (also called an “intrinsic” site) forms when the original counter ion of the charged polymer is exchanged with an oppositely charged moiety on a counter-polymer. This type of interaction is responsible for keeping the membrane together. Diffusion through the membrane has been modeled to correspond to hops between “extrinsic” sites, which correspond to original polymer-counter ion sites which are not unpaired by the counter-polymer [22, 23, 26, 71]. The ratio of extrinsic compensation in an LBL membrane can be fine-tuned by the ionic strength of the assembly solutions. A higher ionic strength corresponds to more extrinsic sites and a more permeable\nmembrane. Permeability also hinges on the thermodynamic propensity of the original counter ion to partner exchange with an oppositely charged moiety on the counter-polymer. This depends on the negative base-10 logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (pKa) of the charged moieties on the polymer backbones and may also be used to fine-tune the permeability of the membrane (a strong vs. a weak polyacid, etc.). LBL membranes have also been reported to assemble based on H-bonds, even in the absence of an electrostatic drive. In this instance, tuning of membrane permeability may be achieved by changing the assembly solution negative logarithmic potential of hydrogen (pH) which varies the degree of protonation on functionalities of interest.\nExperimentally, the LBL method requires the solvation (or suspension) of polymers in a compatible solvent (usually water is used) and the alternation of the substrate between solutions of polymer building blocks with rinses in between. The advantage over simple template polymerization or spin coating of single polymers is simplicity, access to complex substrates, and the availability of a wide variety of building blocks which increases the scientists’ ability to innovate. The LBL method can assemble uniform, nearly pinhole-free films with exceptional mechanical properties such as robustness [80] or self-healing [108]. Much needed fundamental work regarding film assembly and permeability to ions has been continuously published by the groups of Schlenoff and Decher [15]. The groups of Lvov, Mohwald, and Caruso have demonstrated the application of layer-by-layer capsules for biomedical applications such as controlled drug delivery [1, 7, 8, 77]. As far as energy applications, the early works reported from the groups of Hammond and Rubner have led the way to modern applications in a battery such as those discussed here [10, 16, 47, 76]. The evolution of LBL films to mitigate the most urgent challenges of batteries truly stands on the shoulders of these early pioneers in the field."

      "text" : "The use of LBL for battery application is a novel field which has already made a recognizable impact. Conductive polymers such as Nafion, PEDOT:PSS, PANI, and PEO have all been used as layers in functional membranes. For example, a lithiumconductive PEO polymer was considered to assemble LBL films by H-bonding. Tung et al. demonstrated the extreme temperature stability of a composite made from aramid nanofibers (Kevlar) and PEO [80]. Films can be grown on a flat and stiff substrate and then chemically delaminated and used as thin, strong battery separators with ideal Li+ conductivities and electrolyte wettability. The aramid nanofiber/PEO separator is stable to temperatures in excess of 500 C which is the highest performance reported for a polymeric separator (Fig. 10.8). Kim et al. have used a PEO/poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) LBL membrane to protect a sulfur cathode cast on the aluminum current collector [41]. Five cycles improved the cathode wettability and cyclability of the cathode in a lithium-sulfur battery. Bucur et al. reported that a PEO/PAA membrane based on H-bonding can improve the cycle life of sulfur cathodes [3]. 500 cycles were reported with capacities of 700 mAh/g at a fast rate of 2C.\n10 New, Game-Changing Applications of Polymer-Based Coatings in Battery 387\nPolyaniline (PANI) is also a polymer of interest in the battery community due to its inherent electronic conductivity. Like other conjugated polymers, it does not dissolve well in solvents but forms fine suspensions. However, Jeon group was able to build ultrathin (6 μm) LBL polymeric cathodes by spraying PANI and PAA on a current collector [36]. PANI can carry a charge if the pH is carefully controlled and can pair with negatively charged polymers such as PAA. A specific capacity of 100 mAh/g was obtained from this cathode with stable cycling over 1000 cycles. Christinelli et al. have reported that an LBL assembled capacitor can deliver 3000 cycles with 100 F/g capacities [13]. The electrode was assembled from 60 bilayers of poly(omethoxyaniline) (POMA)/poly(3-thiophene acetic acid) (PTAA). The electrochemical performance of graphite anodes was demonstrated to improve when coated with a PAA/PEG multilayer [50]. The self-assembled film improves the stability of the SEI and improves the reversible capacity of artificial, natural, and silicon graphite. Wu et al. reported that a PEI/polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) coating of sulfur/graphite composites improves the polysulfide retention and increases cycle life [84]. 200 cycles are reported at 900 mAh/g or 1.71 mAh/cm2.\nThe poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is a conductive polymer which suspends well in water due to the negatively charged PSS component. Bucur group reported that a PEDOT:PSS/poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) multilayer membrane can improve the cycle life of sulfur cathodes [3] as well as improve the stripping efficiency of lithium metal anodes. There was no evidence of dendritic growth of lithium [2]. Another negatively charged conductive polymer is Nafion. Osada group showed that a Nafion/PDAD LBL membrane can also improve the cycle life of a sulfur cathode due to the blocking of polysulfide diffusion. High capacities of 850 mAh/g or 4.25 mAh/cm2 are reported over 30 cycles. An interesting report was submitted by Wang group who sprayed an LBL coating on a cast sulfur cathode. The membrane was composed of Nafion and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) which afforded 100 stable cycles with a capacity of 1100 mAh/g or 1.5 mAh/cm2. Austing group reported the assembly of a Nafion/ polyethylenimine (PEI) multilayer separator for vanadium/air redox flow batteries [29]. The LBL separator provided higher capacities due to a 21 higher selectivity for protons as well as an increase in charge/discharge efficiency. Yoo group also\nassembled a membrane for a vanadium redox flow battery from a Nafion/sulfonated poly(phenylene oxide) (SPPO) multilayer [97]. Improved proton conductivity was reported.\nA common LBL building block is poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) which is a strong polyelectrolyte with a positive charge. A series of recent reports have been used to form protecting thin multilayers with polyanions such as PSS or PAA. Even in the absence of conductive components, the conformity and thin nature of LBL coatings enable their use in the battery field. Qu group reported the LBL assisted the growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) for battery anodes, which are layered along with PDAD/PSS on carbon fibers [70]. 200 stable cycles are reported with an electrode capacity of 1000 mAh/g or 1.13 mAh/cm2 (Fig. 10.9). Li group used PDAD/PSS to coat graphite-silicon and pure silicon anodes [51]. Improved capacity retention is reported for more than 100 cycles with stable capacities of 450 mAh/g and 2750 mAh/g, respectively, which correspond to 2.25 mAh/cm2 and 13.75 mAh/cm2. Coated materials have the unique feature of stability on a fast charge with minimal differences between 0.1C and 10C. This is the most important benefit for anodes. Currently, commercial graphite anodes can only be operated at low rates of C/2 for long-term cycling. Wang group has also used PDAD/PSS to assemble a carbon fiber/iron oxide (Fe3O4) high-capacity anode [83]. 150 stable cycles with a high capacity of 1250 mAh/g were obtained with large improvements over pristine Fe3O4. A vanadium flow battery was enabled by a PDAD/PAA-coated SPEEK membrane. Improved Coulombic efficiency is reported by Zhao group due to the superior selectivity of the coated SPEEK membrane [104].\nAn interesting concept involving liquid electrolytes containing dissolved polyelectrolytes has been reported by Porcarelli and Buss groups. These approaches improve the thermal stability of liquid electrolytes as well as the conductivity and voltage stability. In the case of Porcarelli group, a new family of single-ion conducting block copolymer polyelectrolytes has been obtained via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The obtained charged polymer is poly(lithium 1-[3-(methacryloyloxy)propylsulfonyl]-1-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) [69]. Compatibility with lithium metal is claimed in this report. Similarly, Buss et al. proposed lithium-neutralized polyanions in solution as a strategy to attain high conductivities and transfer numbers for Li+. The polyelectrolyte used is poly(allyl glycidyl ether) (PAGELS) [5]. A new class of charged polymer electrolytes was also reported by Obadia et al. Poly(1,2,3triazolium) polycationic ionic liquids have been developed based on simple click chemistry [67]."

A 0.27 μm cathode operated with no capacity fade for 1000 cycles at high rates of 35 A/g. Impressively, this cathode offers ~200 mAh/g capacity at 1 A/g rates at an average voltage of 3 V. PDAD is another positively charged polymer which was paired with graphene oxide for lithium-sulfur batteries. Lee group assembled PDAD/GO/sulfur composites which offer improved capacity activation and retention [49]. Transparent cathodes were assembled from sprayed alternate layers of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/vanadium (V) oxide (V2O5), [(PSS+SWNT)/ (PVA+V2O5)] (300 bilayers), and PEO+LiTFSI/PAA+V2O5 (100 bilayers) [27]. 3 μm electrodes can be deposited with capacities of 40 μAh/cm2. 100 cycles are reported with 5 μAh/cm2. Kim group stabilized graphene nanoplatelets with a water/PSS solution and layered them with PDAD/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on a substrate (Fig. 10.9) [40]. The LBL graphene containing material can be used as high-capacity anodes for batteries. A (PANI+sulfur)/(PSS+CNT) layer-by-layer sulfur cathode is demonstrated by Yan group [91]. 600 cycles with an average capacity of 1000 mAh/g and 1.85 mAh/cm2 are reported. Luo group also stabilized a sulfur cathode with a trifunctional interlayer assembled in an LBL fashion from MWCNT and PEG [58]. This interlayer is placed in between a pure sulfur cathode and a Celgard separator. High capacities of 3 mAh/cm2 are obtained over 200 cycles. Silicon anodes were improved by the LBL architecture of bambooderived ultrafine silicon particles with graphene oxide and PDAD [82]."

The H-bonding between zirconium (Zr) and metal center and the COO functionality of PAA ensure film assembly. Xu group demonstrated the PAA/ZrO2 LBL film enhancing a Celgard polyethylene (PE) separator [87]. The enhanced separator shows higher transference numbers for Li+ and improved stabilization of the SEI on the anode. The result is higher rates of operation and improved cycle life. Interestingly, zirconia (ZrO2) has also been used by Chi group to build a ZnO2/silsesquioxane (POSS) multilayered assembly aided by polyethylenimine PEI and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) [11]. Improvements in cycle life are observed. A pinhole-free multilayer membrane assembled from branched PEI and commercial inorganic clay flakes such as Cloisite or montmorillonite was reported by Bucur group to reduce the loss of polysulfides in high-loading sulfur cathodes [4]. Near theoretical capacity for the sulfur cathode is obtained (~1500 mAh/g) at high loadings of 4 mAh/cm2 (Fig. 10.10). The cycle life in this battery was shown to be limited by electrolyte decomposition at the lithium anode rather than by the loss of polysulfides at the cathode.

Graphene is usually used as obtained from the modified Hummers method. Graphene oxide typically has an overall negative charge. This approach allows for very high rates of operation and may open the door to commercial batteries which charge in under 5 min and have >10,000 cycle life. In addition, incorporation of graphene into electrodes also improves heat dissipation. Huawei has recently reported commercial batteries for cell phones which have long cycle life while operating at temperatures as high as 60 C due to the incorporation of graphene.\nAnodes. Kim group built an MWCNT/SiO2 LBL structure which is used in a clip-like configuration to protect lithium metal when used with a sulfur cathode [44]. 250 stable cycles are afforded by the anode protection with an impressive capacity of 6.2 mAh/cm2. This is an important report because the operation of sulfur cathodes hinge on high capacities of stable lithium utilization. Zhang group also assembled a freestanding Si/rGO LBL anode which can operate even if bent [102]. 150 cycles are reported with 600 mAh/g. LBL graphene/Co3O4 nanosheet hybrids have been reported by Yang group as stable anode materials with high capacities of 1000 mAh/g [96]. 50 stable cycles are reported. Dou group also demonstrated a layer-by-layer Co3O4/graphene composite which can cycle 2000 but at a low areal capacity of 0.9 mAh/cm2 [20]. However, high rates of operation are shown for this thin film anode of >2 A/g. Another prospect for a high-capacity anode is Fe3O4. Tan group reported the Fe3O4 nanospheres/MWCNT LBL anode [79]. A stable capacity of 475 mAh/g is obtained for 300 stable cycles at a very high rate of 3.2 A/g (6.75C rate). The areal loadings were low, 0.475 mAh/cm2.\nCathodes. Chen et al. assembled a hierarchical VOx/graphene cathode sheet in an aqueous solution [9]. Capacities of 200 mAh/g (3.5 V) were stable for 500 cycles. Mo et al. also reported a vanadium cathode [61]. LiV3O8/graphene oxide LBL assembled cathodes were obtained by PDAD-treated LiV3O8 which results in a positive charge and allows LBL pairing with graphene oxide. Capacities of 225 mAh/g (2.5 V) (0.5 mAh/cm2) can be maintained stable over 300 cycles at rates of 1.3C (0.3 A/g). Higher rates of 40C (4 A/g) and 115C (8 A/g) still offer stable capacities of 100 mAh/g and 70 mAh/g, respectively. This performance is impressive because commercial graphite anodes cannot charge faster than C/2 for extended cycle life. Mo et al. also reported the extremely high rate of operation of LBL assembled 3D composites of LiFePO4/graphene oxide, by similar techniques [60]. 150 mAh/g (0.81 mAh/cm2) is shown at 1C (a 25% improvement over bulk LiFePO4) for 100 stable cycles. However, the LBL composite can be cycled at 160C and still deliver 50 mAh/g. Yan et al. assembled an LBL Na2FePO4/CNT cathode for sodium batteries. 400 cycles are reported at a rate of 0.4C with capacities of 100 mAh/g [90]. Another sodium cathode was reported by Xu group where sodium vanadium phosphate [Na3V2(PO4)3] was assembled by the LBL method with graphene oxide. Very high cycle life is reported [88]. 15,000 stable cycles at a fast rate of 50C (full discharge in 72 s) with average capacities of 70 mAh/g at a voltage of 3.25 V (Fig. 10.11) are reported. The areal capacity loading was 0.13 mAh/cm2. Capacities as high as 120 mAh/g can be obtained at rates of 1C. Impressive cycle life is also demonstrated at high temperatures of 60 C. These are impressive findings due to the low cost of sodium which may open the door to cheap sodium-ion batteries which can fully charge in a less than 2 min. A 15,000 cycle life would be ideal for commercial vehicles. The LBL approach has also been used by Gupta group to build capacitors from PEI-graphene coupled with MWCNT [31]. An impressive capacity of 75 Wh/kg (similar to nickel-metal hydride, NiMH) and 450 F/g is reported for this capacitor.\n10 New, Game-Changing Applications of Polymer-Based Coatings in Battery 393"

      "text" : "Polymers enable the simple deposition of thin and stable coatings on anodes, separators, and cathode materials which improve the electrochemical performance of the battery. Careful selection of polymers can solve many problems associated with promising new batteries, such as inhibiting dissolution of soluble electrode species and stabilizing electrolyte/electrode interfaces during operation. The end result is a higher energy density and longer cycle life for the battery. For example, by reducing the direct contact of high-voltage cathode materials with the electrolyte, less electrolyte is decomposed, and cycle life is improved. Similarly, coatings on graphite improve the rate of operation of this commercial anode material. A special class of polymeric coatings is the layer-by-layer method introduced by Decher [14]. This approach minimizes the amount of material adsorbed and assembles conformal and pinhole-free coatings which improve conductivity in the battery. It also gives the battery chemist a rich toolset with many new building blocks which can be utilized to assemble LBL films. PANI, Nafion, PEDOT:PSS, graphene oxide, PDAD, and others are all charged polymers or solid materials which have been demonstrated to improve the performance of batteries. The most attractive feature of this method is its addictive nature which can be scaled up to accommodate any battery requirement. The most substantial benefit of LBL assembled electrodes has been the large increase in the rate of operation and cycle life which are key indicators in the evolution of battery technology. In order for widespread acceptance, it will be important for the field of LBL multilayers in the battery space to prove that high capacity loadings in excess of 3 or 4 mAh/cm2 are possible. In addition, LBL may solve many of the challenges encountered in post-lithium-ion fields such as solidstate and multivalent (magnesium) batteries which are currently plagued by low rates of operation."

The chemistry of the substituent groups and the interaction between this cation and anion of an ionic liquid are the key to fine-tune the electrolyte.

      "text" : "The sustainability of energy supply is an emerging key aspect, which until now has been dominated by the fossil fuel sector. The rapid overutilization of these nonrenewable resources has endangered the globalization and eventually hampers the natural habitability owing to pollution and bloated-up greenhouse emissions. This drove the scientific community to look for an alternative renewable energy supply for which Lithium-ion (Li-ion, Li+) batteries are an imperative contender [3, 45]. The applicability of any energy conversion or storage device is highly dependent upon the available specific power against high-energy density. Considering this balance between the obtainable power and energy, batteries lead the forefront as the alternatives like fuel cells have a high-energy density but are limited by their power, whereas the case is vice versa for supercapacitors.\nThe history of Li-ion battery dates back to the 1900s with the advent of highenergy dense but unsafe lithium batteries; following these a relatively low-energy dense but safer Li-ion batteries were developed by utilizing the phenomena of intercalation [51] of Li-ions into layered graphite anodes having better safety features compared to the former. The efforts of Yoshino et al. [52] in the year 1987 were patented describing the use of carbon-based (C) anode along with lithium cobalt(III) oxide (LiCoO2) cathode in building an initial prototype whose designing was employed in manufacturing early Li-ion batteries. This led to the eventual commercialization of Li-ion batteries by Sony [3, 22], and the untiring efforts of Goodenough, Yazami, and Yoshino were awarded the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Medal in 2012 for their unmatchable pioneering innovation. Since then, the battery has revolutionized the energy sector especially in the sphere of portable electronics and at present is swiftly moving toward heavy load applications like in power grids, hybrid electric vehicles, and the like [45].\nThe rechargeable Li-ion batteries have a unique capability of holding and subsequently delivering a large amount of charge per unit of Li-ions involved. This\n402 A. Tiwari et al.\nphenomenon could be described by considering a battery system composed of a graphite (C) anode and a lithium cobalt(III) oxide (LiCoO2) cathode, for instance, both separated and yet ionically connected by an electrolyte which till date are predominantly organic electrolyte mixtures. The reactions involved in these electrodes during charging are:\nAnode : Cn þ xLiþ þ xe ! CnLix\nCathode : LiCoO2 ! Li1 xCoO2 þ xLiþ þ xe\nThe reactions involved during discharging are:\nAnode : CnLix ! Cn þ xLiþ þ xe\nCathode : Li1 xCoO2 þ xLiþ þ xe ! LiCoO2 Overall reaction can be represented as follows wherein the forward reaction\ndepicts charging and the reverse denotes discharging:\nLiCoO2 þ Cn Ð Li1 xCoO2 þ CnLix Simply, the energy is stored in the anode upon providing external electron flow forcing electronic movement from the cathode to the anode wherein the Li-ions tend to intercalate between the layered graphite anodes. This overall process of storing the electrical energy chemically in the cathode in the form of chemical potentials is termed as charging. The opposite occurs when an external load is powered by this charged battery wherein the electrons move externally from anode to cathode, while the Li-ions simultaneously intercalate the cathode by shuttling via the electrolyte. Considering these electrode chemical potentials which invariably depend upon the electrode material employed the theoretical voltage of the battery cell which can be obtained by estimating the total Gibbs free energy using:\nΔE ¼ ΔG=nF where, the cell voltage, E (V), is directly proportional to the change in Gibbs free energy, G (kJ/mol), and the number of electrons involved, n, along with the Faraday constant, F (96485.3 C mol 1). This cell voltage obtainable from Li-ion battery is 4.2 V which is very high compared to any other battery currently commercialized in the market. This is the reason wherein the number of cells required to power suitable electronics has reduced favoring the compact design of gadgets and is the sole reason of wide verse application in a host of portable electronics.\nThe wide-scale applicability of Li-ion battery derives further research toward betterment by improving the various battery components, namely, anode, cathode, and electrolyte. The evolution of better electrodes strives to improve the inherent energy as well as power density, but these high-energy electrodes have a major\n11 Functionalized Ionic Liquid-Based Electrolytes for Li-Ion Batteries 403\ndisadvantage of instability in terms of their interaction with the battery electrolyte upon charging and discharging. Therefore, improvement toward high-energy electrodes demands simultaneous research for better electrolytes both in terms of their functioning and safety considerations. The electrolyte has a vital role to play in the overall functioning of the Li-ion battery and lies at the heart of a smoothly operating battery [22]. Looking more closely at the electrolyte, it essentially is an electronic insulator not allowing any electrons resulting from the oxidation of Li-ions at the anode during discharging to pass through which would otherwise lead to shortcircuiting and eventually blasting of the battery. Rather, it is required to be an excellent ionic conductor which would facilitate the movement of these resulting Li-ions at the anode to the cathode through the separator preferably at a pace similar to that of the electrons reaching the cathode through the external circuit.\nIn this pursuit, the electrolyte is expected to have a high conductivity in the range of 1–10 mS/cm [16] and a low viscosity for efficient battery cycling. The electrolyte thereby plays an important role in the overall functioning of battery acting as the reservoir of Li-ions which subsequently undergoes intercalation in the cathode during discharging whereas in the anode during the charging process from the electrolyte. So, overall the electrolyte facilitates the diffusion of Li-ions under the influence of electric charge and is therefore expected to possess a very high ionic conductivity so that it affords minimum resistance toward diffusion. Besides this basic function of shuttling Li-ions effectively between the two electrodes, the battery electrolyte should also be electrochemically stable within the working potential range of the battery. A measure of this safety is usually reflected by a wide potential window termed as electrochemical stability window (ESW) in which the electrolyte does not react with the electrode material which may otherwise lead to its degradation. Collectively, the desirable aspects of a successful Li-ion battery electrolyte include:\n• High conductivity • High transference number • Wide thermal stability • Wide electrochemical stability window (ESW) • Unreactive with active electrode material • Passivation ability • Nonvolatile and non-flammable • Low environmental impact • Cost-effective\nThe common commercialized Li-ion battery uses organic solvents like alkyl carbonates as an electrolyte [14] which affords high conductivity for the Li-ions but suffers from the inherent safety issues. The major drawback of the organic solvents as electrolytes is their high volatility and flammability; besides they are also limited by their ESW due to their instability/decomposition at the working potentials of the battery. These organic electrolytes cannot be employed in case of the high-energy electrodes as they have a low flash point which ultimately hampers obtainable output in terms of energy and power density for heavy load application.\n404 A. Tiwari et al.\nDeveloping a safe electrolyte requires either stabilization of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer by introducing additives and/or enlarging the electrochemical stability window by widening the highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap for the designed electrolyte which subsequently prevents dendrite formation over the anode surface. Considering the battery stability in terms of electronic energies of the anode, cathode, and electrolyte requires the electrolyte stability window to lie between the energy of the anode (reductant; constituting the LUMO) and that of the cathode (oxidant; constituting the HOMO) [21]. If the anode has a higher energy than the LUMO of the electrolyte, it will increasingly reduce the electrolyte unless a stable insulating barrier separates the two. Similarly, for the cathode, if the energy of the cathode lies below the HOMO of the electrolyte, then the electrolyte is increasingly prone to oxidative degradation unless a passivation layer forms atop the cathode barring electronic interaction with electrolyte. So essentially SEI layer formation imparts kinetic stability to the battery against high operating potential. Therefore, designing a stable electrolyte requires:\n• Appropriate matching between the electrolyte HOMO-LUMO levels with the cathode and anode, respectively • Rapid formation of a passivating SEI, which would self-heal upon cracking during charge-discharge cycling, thereby preventing dendrite formation • Overall the formed SEI must allow a fast transfer of Li-ions across the electrodeelectrolyte interface for effective cycling\nOther major challenges associated with organic electrolytes are the instability of the formed SEI passivating the reactive electrode surface which tends to intercalate within the graphite anode and exfoliates with successive cycling [55]. This exfoliation in coherence with the dendrite formation at the lithium (Li) anode poses grave concern both toward safety and achievable specific capacity from the battery. These shortcomings of the organic electrolytes causing serious functioning issues demand further research toward alternative electrolytes. The suitable replacement options available include employing fluidic salts or room temperature ionic liquids (ILs) and the use of solid electrolytes like polymer-based electrolytes and inorganic electrolytes [5, 6, 17, 43]. Application of the solid electrolytes is an ideal alternative considering the safety features and reduced impact of dendrite formation, but they are potentially challenged by their greatly reduced ionic conductivities. The conductivity obtainable by solid electrolytes is of the order of 10 5–10 8 S/cm compared to 1–20 mS/cm for organic electrolytes which is the result of high interfacial resistance between the solid-solid interface of electrode and electrolyte [9]. Besides, the kinetics of intercalation-de-intercalation is also suppressed greatly posing a grave challenge for solid electrolytes. On the other hand ILs also tend to have a slightly reduced ionic conductivity owing to their viscous nature, but the trade-off between slight conductivity losses to improved safety is a viable alternative.\nThereby, ionic liquids (ILs) come as handy electrolytes allowing a great degree of tunability and stability over a wide temperature range. Ionic liquids have already found diverse applicability in the fields ranging from solvents in green synthesis, as\n11 Functionalized Ionic Liquid-Based Electrolytes for Li-Ion Batteries 405\nlubricants in machining, gas storage and modification, waste recycling and as a processing agent in different industries [20]. The various attributes of ionic liquids which attract wide-sphere application are [2]:\n• Nonvolatile • Non-flammable • High thermal stability • Electrochemical stability • Improved solvation • Ionic conductivity\nThese features enable ILs to be a favorable alternative as electrolytes in the battery. The most important aspect of ILs is their enormous tuning ability in both the cation and the anion exhibiting weak interionic interactions resulting in low crystallization temperature and therefore wide liquid range along with low vapor pressure. Due to the ionic nature, ILs easily solvate Li-ions and subsequently carry them to respective electrodes under electric field, and the extent of this shuttling can be fine-tuned by tailoring the viscosity of the ILs depending on its constituents [41]. While designing the battery electrolyte, another major aspect is the electrochemical stability within the potential window of battery functioning which is hard to achieve in case of organic electrolytes as they are prone to degradation either at the anodic or at the cathodic limit ultimately restraining the obtainable voltage output from the battery during safe operation. Most ILs are stable in the wide potential range and thereby counteract this utmost major functional as well as safety limitation posed in case of organic electrolytes. Taking these features into consideration, there is a need to move toward IL-based electrolytes in the battery.\nThe most common and simple IL in present times [with common chemical formulae] is derived from the quaternary ammonium salts [(CH3)4N(Cl)] [24] and cyclic amines like pyrrolidinium [C5H11BF3N], piperidinium [C6H13BF3N], and aromatic amines like pyridinium [C5H6NClCrO3] and imidazolium [C6H10Cr2N4O7] [15, 18, 36, 49]. Likewise, other cations are sulfonium [C6H14ClNO2S], phosphonium [C16H34BrO2P], guanidinium [CH6BrN3], and the like [31, 48]. These cations constitute the core of the IL, however, functionalizing these cores with a variety of substituents, and design them as functional cations depending upon the desired application [20, 40, 50]. Similarly, the anions range from small and charge dense inorganic anions like halide [F] , [Cl] , [Br] , [I] , and acetato [OAc ] to delocalized inorganic anions tetrafluoroborate [BF4]\n, hexafluorophosphate [PF6] , hexafluoroarsenate(V) [AsF6] , or amide [N(CN)2]\nto charge-delocalized organic anions like perfluorobutane sulfonate [C4F9SO3]\n, trifluoroacetate [CF3CO2] , triflate [CF3SO3] , amides ([N(CF3SO2)2]\nand [CF3CONCF3SO2] ), and methide [C(CF3SO2)3] [18, 34, 42].\nAmong these large number of choices for cationic core like imidazolium, quaternary ammonium, phosphonium, piperidinium, pyrrolidinium, guanidinium, and phosphonium which mainly control various physicochemical and electrochemical properties of an IL, imidazolium-based ILs have found wide-sphere applications\n406 A. Tiwari et al.\n[2, 21] especially in the field of battery electrolytes because of its relative ease of synthesis with different substituents, relatively low viscosity, high ionic conductivity, low melting point, resistive toward moisture and temperature, and a favorable electrochemical window which can be fine-tuned by the substituents. These imidazolium cation-based ILs can act as a good electrolyte for transporting the Li-ion in between the two electrodes only when it is teamed up with a suitable anion. The choice of anions ranges from small and charge dense inorganic anions like halides to charge-delocalized organic anions like amides [N(CF3SO2)2]\nor dicyandiamide [N(CN)2]\n. However, a weak interaction between these two components of the ionic liquid is usually preferred by combining a large cation with a highly delocalized anion resulting in a small charge to radius ratio [41]. This confers low lattice energies resulting in weak electrostatic bonding yielding low crystallization tendency for obtaining low melting point and low viscosity in turn high ionic conductivity, which are two integral requirements of a battery electrolyte [23]. In this regard, N, N- bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (TFSI, [(CF3SO2)2N]\n) anion is a good choice as it possesses good ionic conductivity, thermal and electrochemical stability, and moisture resistive and also induces the formation of stable SEI layer to achieve long and safe battery cycling [4, 32]. Therefore, combining an imidazolium cation with delocalized TFSI anion would be a suitable choice for alternative IL electrolyte for the battery. Since the electrolyte is the reservoir of Li-ions in a battery, the addition of a Li-salt would provide the complete configuration of the electrolyte, but since it is preferred to use the salt with the similar anion to maximize the amount of soluble Li-ion, the choice of salt is lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI, LiC2F6NO4S2) in the present scenario. Besides, the usage of ILs also counteracts the problem of solvent co-intercalation in the electrode as the Li-ions are solvated by the anions and they lack the co-intercalation tendency at potentials prevalent at the anode.\nThe use of IL electrolyte comes handy as they perform the shuttling of Li-ions at the positive electrode (cathode) without any problem due to their high oxidative stability even against highly oxidizing materials like lithium manganese(III) phosphate (LiMnPO4) [2]. But by using a simple imidazolium-based cation, it will be difficult to withstand the high negative potentials required for Li-ion deposition; however if somehow a stable passivating layer forms atop the anode of the battery quickly, this provides kinetic metastability to the cation of the IL electrolyte. To avoid this unlikely reaction, two significant alternatives would be appropriately functionalizing the imidazolium core [38] and the addition of small amount of organic solvent as an additive to aggravate the SEI layer formation over the highenergy anode [21, 32]. Similar effort toward functionalization of the imidazolium core was attempted by Ferrari group [15] wherein they have reported that introducing ether side chains to the central imidazolium cation brings down the crystallization temperature of the IL because of the flexibility in the ether chain and a weak interaction between the oxygen groups of the ether and the large TFSI anion. Besides it also exhibited decreased viscosity due to the presence of labile ether functionalization resulting in the ionic conductivity of 2.9 mS/cm at 20 C. Higher viscosity resulting from the large ions usually having a low charge to radius ratio can be\n11 Functionalized Ionic Liquid-Based Electrolytes for Li-Ion Batteries 407\nreduced by mixing with the organic solvent like ethylene carbonate (EC, C3H4O3), propylene carbonate (PC, C4H6O3), etc. These organic additives being more reactive compared to the ILs tend to react predominantly over the high-energy anode forming passivating surface films essentially stabilizing the battery system [29]. These electrolyte additives facilitate the battery performance by aggravating the SEI layer formed over the high-energy electrode, stabilize the formed SEI to minimize its cracking by gas evolution due to decomposition of the electrolyte and/or dissolution with cycling, improves the physicochemical properties of the ILs in terms of their obtainable conductivity, wettability, safety and likewise. Further, the addition of polymerizable additives is also popular since they form a mesh-like structure over the reactive electrodes, thereby preventing deterioration. Important examples are propylene carbonate (PC, C4H6O3), methyl propargyl sulfone (PMS)[HC CCH2SO2CH3, 3-methanesulfonylprop-1-yne], and the like which upon reduction tend to form good passivating moieties allowing facile Li-ion diffusion and restricted detrimental reaction [14]. So essentially, a functionalized IL mixture with a suitable stabilizing additive is an appropriate methodology for designing a composite battery electrolyte [49]."

      "text" : "The challenge of modeling an electrolyte for successful application in Li-ion battery requires conceptual designing of the ionic liquid components to fine-tune the obtainable stability and ionic conductivity. The use of imidazolium-based cation functionalized at both the nitrogen is a suitable alternative although it requires finetuning in terms of the substituent groups and their respective chain lengths.\nThe present text details the effect of two different substituents, namely, alkoxy (R–O–R) and siloxy (Si–O–Si) groups over the imidazolium cation, teaming it up with a diffused anion, bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [TFSI]. The trialkyl imidazolium anion can be substituted at the N1 (leftmost) –C2 (Center) or N3 + (rightmost) in the imidazolium ring, and a numbering/labeling scheme is read right to left. For example, an imidazolium (Im)-based bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) substitute at the N1 (by CH3), C1 (with H), and N2 (CH2CH3) would be classified as Im-1-H-2-TFSI. In a similar manner, ether substitutes are classified by carbon number between the oxygen atoms. For example, substitute at the N1 (by CH2CH3), C1 (with CH3), and N2 (with CH2CH2OCH2CH3) would be classified as Im-2o1-1-2-TFSI. The imidazolium ring was substituted with different length ethers yielding different ILs Im-1o2o2-H-2o1-TFSI (1), Im-1o2o2-H-1SioSi-TFSI (2), and Im-1o2-H-1SioSi-TFSI (3), respectively, and is represented in Scheme 11.1. The Im-1o2 group can be represented as R3 = CH2CH2OCH2CH3 (at Nþ2 ). These unsymmetrical imidazolium-based ILs with alkoxy and siloxy groups were obtained from their N-substituted imidazolium iodides which were synthesized under microwave irradiation, a greener synthetic route for the bulk production of the ILs. For instance, Im-1o2o2-H-2o1-TFSI (1) were synthesized under microwave irradiation of N-alkoxy imidazole and 1-Iodo-3-methoxypropane in acetonitrile at a temperature\n408 A. Tiwari et al.\nof 150 C for 40 min. The obtained IL [Im-1o2o2-H-2o1]I was subsequently anion exchanged with LiTFSI in acetone to give ether-ether IL (1). The other ILs followed the same synthetic protocol [7].\nViscosity is an important parameter considering the electrolytic application of functionalized ionic liquid which is governed by the size, symmetry, and nature of interactions existing between the cation and anion of the IL [26]. The interactions like interionic interactions, van der Waals forces, and hydrogen bonding are responsible for the inherent viscosity of the ILs or any system, for instance [19]. This parameter is highly dependent upon the working temperature and is well explained by the Arrhenius relation excluding the behavior wherein the IL approaches the melting point. Generally, these molten salts (ILs) are quite viscous at reduced temperatures due to the high interionic interactions.\nThe low viscosity of electrolyte will have higher ionic conductivity, and so better Li-ions transport through the electrolyte during the charge-discharge process. The viscosity of these imidazolium-based ILs depends upon the nature of substituents on imidazolium core and the interactions between the cation and anion. In the present scenario, all three ILs possess imidazolium cation having alkoxy and siloxy side chains on both nitrogen and TFSI as the anion and their differential interaction is reflected on the observed viscosity and in turn conductivity. Therefore, the substituents were designed to possess two CH2 spacers to minimize the effect of electron-withdrawing by an alkoxy group. While the siloxy group was introduced to study its electron donating effect whereby the positive charge of the core is partially balanced and decreases its interaction with the anion. Screening of viscosities of the three designed ILs Im-1o2o2-H-2o1-TFSI (1), Im-1o2o2-H-1SioSi-TFSI (2), and Im-1o2-H-1SioSi-TFSI (3) is detailed in Table 11.1 for a wide temperature range (10–100 C). The viscosities of both Im-1o2o2-H-2o1-TFSI (1) and Im-1o2o2-H-1SioSi-TFSI (2) ILs were found to be quite close, whereas that for the Im-1o2-H-1SioSi-TFSI (3) IL was on the higher\nScheme 11.1 Functionalized ionic liquids studied toward electrolyte application\n11 Functionalized Ionic Liquid-Based Electrolytes for Li-Ion Batteries 409\nend. This could be due to the high molecular mass of the Im-1o2-H-1SioSi-TFSI (3) IL without the additional benefit from molecular flexion from single ether substituent versus the two ether groups. Hence, IL (3) has not considered for further study as a battery electrolyte.\nThe basic property of redox stability especially in the working potential range of the battery is well described by voltammetric studies for both the designed etherether (1) and ether-siloxane and (2) ILs. In addition, the process of rapid SEI layer formation over the reactive anode was addressed by incorporating an additive, i.e., propylene carbonate (PC) in the IL electrolyte containing lithium bis9trifluoromethanesulfonimidate (LiTFSI) as the source of Li-ion. This stable passivating film protects further degradation of both the anode and electrolyte while allowing diffusion of only Li-ions for the continuous charge-discharge process. Electrochemical stability of the IL (1 and 2) was studied by linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) study in the potential range between 3.5 to 5.0 V. The LSV for the two variants of electrolytes being studied, viz., ether-ether (1) and ethersiloxane (2) as neat, IL with PC (48:52) and IL + PC + Li (37:41:22 c:c:c), is shown in Fig. 11.1. The electrochemical stability window (ESW) is the intersection point of the mean current with respect to (w.r.t.) voltage for both the oxidative and reductive sections giving anodic and cathodic limits derived from the LSVs.\nThe potential range between the anodic and the cathodic limits signifies the ESW and is 5.0 V for neat ether-ether IL, whereas it is 5.5 V for ether-siloxane IL, respectively. The high potential stability window for neat ether-siloxane could be attributed to the presence of d-orbitals in Si present as the cationic substituent. However, upon addition of the PC, the ESW in ether-siloxane increased slightly to 5.7 V, whereas that for an ether-ether slight decrease to 4.8 V was observed. However, upon addition of LiTFSI into these PC and IL mixture, a noticeable increase in the ESW for ether-ether IL from 5.0 to 5.9 V was observed, whereas\n410 A. Tiwari et al.\nESW decreased drastically from 5.5 to 4.2 V for ether-siloxane IL. These striking observations could be due to the aggregation being more prevalent for ether-siloxane IL which upon Li-salt addition forms aggregates with Li-ion while exposing the organic cation making it more susceptible to potential-dependent degradation. These observations were further validated from electrochemical conductivity analysis. Considering the profound electrochemical stability of ether-ether IL, temperaturedependent ESW analysis was studied as given in Table 11.2. Upon increasing the temperature from 10 C to 50 C, the window remained nearly 5 V for neat with a slight decrease at 60 C, whereas upon addition of PC, the ESW decreased compared to the neat IL across all temperatures; however, upon further addition of LiTFSI, the stability window increased for all temperatures and decreased slightly at elevated temperatures. Further, electrochemical cyclability test for the solvent mixture having ether-ether IL + PC + LiTFSI showed a stable behavior for 50 cycles.\nApart from the potentiodynamic analysis, another important criterion for an electrolyte to furnish in the battery is the transportation of Li-ions across the electrodes during the charge-discharge process. This depends on the intercalationde-intercalation phenomena, and the speed of Li-ions shuttling between the electrodes; faster the Li-ions shuttling better is the battery response. In order to\nassess this feature, the conductivity of the two functionalized ILs was studied by temperature-dependent impedance spectroscopic under argon atmosphere. Impedance analysis was performed in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz stepped-up logarithmically using a suitable direct current (DC) potential over an alternating current (AC) perturbation of 10 mV. The potential-dependent impedance analysis ranging from 3.0 V to 2.0 V, i.e., potentials within the ESW, was studied initially for both the ether-ether and ether-siloxane IL electrolyte comprising of the additive PC and LiTFSI which forms the mixture IL + PC + LiTFSI. As expected, this potential variation within the ESW did not have any effect upon the impedance behavior as depicted in Fig. 11.2a, b. The resultant Nyquist plot showed a semicircular behavior with a stout tail giving solution resistance (Rs) as the high-frequency intercept of the real axis whereas polarization resistance (Rp) as the low-frequency intercept and a Warburg diffusion feature at low frequency in the presence of LiTFSI owing to the diffusion of the Li-ion. Since the potential in the entire range within ESW had no role in the impedance behavior, further studies at a fixed potential of 2 V were assessed by varying the temperatures from 10 C to 60 C for the (IL + PC + LiTFSI) electrolyte mixtures of both the ILs. The features observed remained the same across the temperature range with the only striking observation being a reduction in the diameter of the semicircle with increasing temperature for both the ILs but with varying extent. This observation was materialized by computing the charge transfer resistance (Rct, Ω) which is obtained from the difference between the Rp and Rs and is the diameter of the observed semicircle in the Nyquist plot.\nThe Rct in conjunction with the cell constant of the electrochemical cell used yielded the conductivity offered by the electrolyte and is given in Table 11.3. As evident from Fig. 11.2c, d, the conductivity of ether-ether IL is almost twice that of the ether-siloxane IL at room temperature and tends to increase significantly upon addition of the organic additive (PC) to almost three times for both the ILs, but the conductivity decreased drastically upon addition of LiTFSI salt (1 mol/kg). The conductivity of the ether-ether IL in the IL + PC + LiTFSI mixture as a battery electrolyte was found to be 2.2 mS/cm whereas merely 0.5 mS/cm for ethersiloxane-based electrolyte compared to their neat IL being 4.6 and 2.5 mS/cm, respectively. These observations are attributed to the solvation of LiTFSI forming clusters leading to slower Li-ion diffusion across the electrodes. However, as expected the conductivity increased with increase in temperature for the different compositions due to thermal convection which decreases the viscosity and enhances the Li-ion shuttling across the electrodes (detailed in an upcoming section). The detailed impedance analysis suggested that potential is insignificant toward the impedance irrespective of the electrolyte system within the ESW. Furthermore, the ether-ether IL provides better conductivity toward Li-ions even in a very high LiTFSI concentration of 1 mol/kg solvent.\nThe electrochemical conductivity measurements were also supported by viscosity analysis since the viscosity is a key element for the conductivity and is inversely proportional to the conductivity of the various electrolytes (Fig. 11.2e–f). Viscosity studies in the temperature ranging from 10 C to 100 C at a heating rate of 5 C/min\n412 A. Tiwari et al.\nunder inert atmosphere are detailed in Table 11.4 wherein both the neat ILs possess nearly the same viscosity which decreases upon increasing the temperature with ether-ether IL being slightly less viscous. When these ILs are in combination with the organic additive such as PC, the viscosity decreases drastically which is quite\nprominent for ether-ether IL compared to ether-siloxane IL. Finally, upon addition of LiTFSI, the viscosity of the mixture increased manifolds, i.e., 197 mPa.s for ethersiloxane IL + PC + LiTFSI whereas only 140 mPa.s for ether-ether IL + PC + LiTFSI compared to the viscosity of neat ILs which were 74 and 71 mPa.s, respectively at 25 C. However, as thermal convection sets in with increasing temperature, the viscosity drops down significantly. Considering the viscosity of these two electrolytes, the IL mixture for the ether-ether variant exhibits significantly less viscosity compared to the ether-siloxane electrolyte mixture and is therefore expected to possess a higher conductivity which matches with the impedance-derived conductivity measurement.\nThe pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) NMR analysis for both the ILs and their respective mixtures with PC and LiTFSI (1 mol/kg electrolyte) was measured at 25 C under an inert atmosphere to determine the self-diffusion coefficients of the various components. Calibration of the self-diffusion coefficient was standardized against the standard 2.27 10 9 m2 s 1 value [27] for water (H2O) at 25 C. The determination of self-diffusion coefficients of the various electrolyte components, namely, the imidazolium cation and Li-ion and TFSI anion, was made by analyzing the hydrogen-1 (1H), fluorine-19 (19F), and lithium-7 (7Li) NMR and by the careful elimination of error from sample motion by stagnant NMR analysis without sample spinning. The self-diffusion coefficients were determined by computing the echo signal attenuation (E), as follows [47]:\nln Eð Þ ¼ ln S Sg o ¼ γ2g2Dδ2 Δ δ 3\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient (m2/s), S is the spin echo signal intensity (T), δ is the duration of the field gradient with magnitude g (T/m), γ is the gyromagnetic ratio (rad T 1 s 1), and Δ is the interval between the two gradient pulses (ms). The selfdiffusion coefficients for imidazolium cation was 4.16 10 11 m2 s 1 for etherether IL whereas only 3.76 10 11 m2 s 1 for ether-siloxane IL. Similarly, the TFSI anion (by 19F NMR) was 4.52 10 11 for the former and 4.49 10 11 m2 s 1 for the latter IL. The ability of the designed ILs to conduct Li-ion was further hinted by\n414 A. Tiwari et al.\nthe diffusion coefficient determination upon addition of LiTFSI to the ILs which visibly forms more viscous solution having lower fluidity. Under such circumstances, ether-ether IL + LiTFSI solution exhibited a greatly reduced self-diffusion coefficient of 0.32 10 11 m2 s 1 for imidazolium cation (by 1H NMR), 0.96 10 11 m2 s 1 for TFSI (by 19F NMR), and 0.08 10 11 m2 s 1 for Li+ (by 7Li), whereas that for ether-siloxane IL + LiTFSI, it was 0.31 10 11 m2 s 1, 0.56 10 11 m2 s 1, and 0.11 10 11 m2 s 1, respectively. However, upon further addition of the additive (PC), i.e., in the solution of IL + PC + LiTFSI for ether-ether IL, the diffusion coefficient increased compared to the IL + TFSI solution giving 2.12 10 11 m2 s 1 for imidazolium cation, 1.14 10 11 m2 s 1 for TFSI, and 0.52 10 11 m2 s 1 for Li+, but for ether-siloxane it was only 1.98 10 11 m2 s 1, 1.89 10 11 m2 s 1, and 0.25 10 11 m2 s 1, respectively. These observations for self-diffusion coefficient measurements indicate that neat ether-ether IL exhibits higher ability of ionic diffusion or mobility compared to the ether-siloxane IL and upon addition of LiTFSI to these ILs the diffusion coefficient of imidazolium cation reduces by a factor of 13, whereas for TFSI anion it reduces almost four times for both the ILs. Thereby, the addition of very large amount of Li-salt (1 mol/kg) in the electrolyte causes highly reduced mobility of the Li-ions as indicated by their very low diffusion coefficients which are in coherence with the conductivity as well as viscosity measurements. On comparing the total diffusion (Dsum), the decrease on addition of LiTFSI is less pronounced, i.e., only six times for ether-ether IL, whereas it is around eight times for ether-siloxane IL.\nThese observations point toward a higher degree of aggregation prevalent in the ether-siloxane system forming highly solvated Li-ion clusters having a bigger effective Li+ radius. Whereas for the ether-ether IL, the ether substituent provides more flexibility and the affinity of the ether moiety toward Li-ions which helps to collapse the formed Li TFSI½ nnþ1 clusters and discourage the formation of TFSI\n11 Functionalized Ionic Liquid-Based Electrolytes for Li-Ion Batteries 415\nsolvated Li+ clusters. However, upon addition of PC, the diffusion of the overall electrolyte increased, but the relative increase was found to be the highest for Li-ions, thereby facilitating their movement during the charge-discharge process in battery. These diffusion coefficients are in-line with the conductivity measurements. The electrolyte system is composed of ether-ether IL + PC + LiTFSI possessing the flexible ether functionality with an affinity toward Li-ions and thereby improving the mobility as well as conductivity by incorporating more Li-ion at both of their side chains compared to the ether-siloxane IL-based electrolyte.\nThese findings suggest that the ether groups over the imidazolium core play an important role in preventing the self-aggregation of ions. The addition of a high concentration of LiTFSI (1 mol/kg solvent) increases the content of TFSI anion which forms a big solvation shell around the Li+ ion decreasing its mobility and in turn conductivity, while the viscosity tends to shoot up. Another contributing factor from the formation of solvated Li TFSI½ n nþ1 species is the ionic migration being governed by both the concentration as well as potential gradient owing to its overall negative charge. These propositions were testified further by IR studies, initially monitoring the variation of carbonyl (C=O) stretching frequency of PC (1786 cm 1) which increased upon the addition of either of the ILs (1788.0 cm 1 for E-E IL and 1791.8 cm 1 for E-S IL) due to PC aggregate dispersion and again further decreased to 1786 cm 1 upon Li-ion addition in either of the ILs as expected due to reaggregation. The interaction between the cation and the TFSI anion was subsequently studied by monitoring the S-N-S stretching frequency which was 788.5 cm 1 for ether-ether whereas 789.0 cm 1 for ether-siloxane IL, respectively. This frequency decreased to 777.0 cm 1 for both the ILs upon inclusion of the additive (PC) which is indicative of a weak interaction between TFSI and imidazolium cation. Further addition of LiTFSI to the neat ether-ether IL increased the S-N-S stretching frequency from 788.5 cm 1 to 791.5 cm 1 which can be attributed to the solvation of Li-ions by TFSI. The effect is more pronounced in the case of ether-siloxane (789.0 cm 1 to 794.0 cm 1) when more TFSI are involved in clusters formation as revealed from viscosity and conductivity studies.\nThe various studies for both the ether-ether (E-E) IL and ether-siloxane (E-S) IL mixture electrolytes in different aspects like potential stability, dynamic impedancederived conductivity, viscosity, and current resistance (IR) measurements point toward E-E + PC + LiTFSI electrolyte to be the most promising out of the two as a potential battery electrolyte. Since the safety of battery even under thermal runaway is of utmost importance, therefore, the thermal stability of electrolyte was analyzed for both E-E and E-S IL, IL + LiTFSI, IL + PC, and IL + PC + LiTFSI by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and is shown in Fig. 11.3a–c. Both the neat IL and IL + LiTFSI undergo maximal weight loss (ca. 90%) between 350 C and 530 C, but when PC is the part of the electrolyte (i.e., in IL + PC and IL + PC + LiTFSI), weight loss occurred in two major steps, i.e., nearly 15% up to 245 C which could be accounted for the additive, PC, and the major 75% from 350 C to 530 C due to the IL dissociation. An interesting observation is that the electrolyte is highly stable having a high thermal decomposition temperature (Tstart) of 150 C for E-E IL and 130 C for E-S IL while being non-flammable catering to the safety concern. Applicability at the wider temperature range determines the\n416 A. Tiwari et al.\nsafety, but worldwide applicability also demands low crystallization temperature considering weather across the globe. This lower limit applicability of an electrolyte was effectively tested by performing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements in the temperature range of 90 to 20 C at 5 C/min. and is shown in Fig. 11.3b, d. The DSC studies did not reveal any crystallization; rather a glass transition (Tg) at 74 C was observed for neat E-E IL and 72 C for E-S IL which remains nearly the same even after addition of LiTFSI but further reduces to 84 C and 84 C when PC was added to E-E and E-S IL, respectively. In case of electrolyte mixture, viz., IL + PC + LiTFSI for E-E, Tg increased slightly to 81 C and 77 C for E-S mixture but remained lower than the neat IL owing to its high flexibility. The maximization of the temperature range between the Tg and Tstart (i.e., from 81 C to 150 C) allows the potential use of E-E IL mixture (with PC and LiTFSI) as an electrolyte in Li-ion batteries as it is functional in a wide temperature range and is also resistive toward thermal decomposition and runaway.\nFollowing the detailed analysis of the E-E IL-based electrolyte features toward favorable application, the E-E IL was further assessed for battery performance analysis in a Swagelok cell as a proof of concept presented by the study. The compiled cell consisted of a graphite anode and lithium cobalt(III) oxide (LiCoO2)\ncathode separated by a Whatman filter paper soaked with the E-E-based electrolyte (E-E IL + PC + LiTFSI mixture) and cycled galvanostatically to obtain the chargedischarge characteristics as represented in Fig. 11.4a. The first discharge capacity amounted to 85.7 mA h/g during which the stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer was formed over the anode by accelerated reaction with the propylene carbonate (PC) upon subsequent cycling and the capacity declines to 39.4 mA h/g after tenth cycle and finally became steady at 37.9 mA h/g after 50 cycles. This capacity variation with a number of cycles is shown in Fig. 11.4b which is fairly stable by the end of the 50th cycle and projects the final applicability of the designed appropriately functionalized IL system in Li-ion batteries.\nThis charge-discharge analysis clearly projects the formation of a stable SEI layer following the first few cycles which has subsequently yielded a stable cycling performance. The formation of this stable SEI layer is a key aspect for high-energy electrodes to constantly attain reproducible and long charge-discharge cycling. Thereby, understanding the composition and mechanism of its formation is of utmost necessity to achieve a stable and long-lived battery cycling. Various spectroscopic studies toward analyzing the SEI composition [54] have suggested that the SEI is essentially composed of the remnants from the active reaction between the reactive electrode and the electrolyte and/or additive by large forming carbonates (lithium carbonate, lithium alkyl carbonate, etc.), lithium oxides (Li2O), alkoxides (LiOCH3), and fluorides (LiF) along with salts [11]."

      "heading" : "11.3 C2-Substitution on Imidazolium Ionic Liquids Toward Improved Stability and Performance",
      "text" : "Presently, the portable energy market is dominated by Li-ion batteries; however their energy density is insufficient to support highly demanding applications like electric vehicles and smart grid power supply [44]. Besides limited specific capacity, another\nappealing challenge associated with these future high-energy batteries is their safety while providing high voltages especially because of electrolyte limitations [49]. An electrolyte which can sustain a wide range of potential application without hampering the battery performance is urgently required [21]. This section details an approach to modify the ILs toward application in high-energy batteries research. Majority of the above discussion details the role of functionalizing 1 and 3 positions of the imidazolium cation core. Varying the functional groups attached at 1 and 3 positions significantly affected the physicochemical properties of the ILs and their applicability as an electrolyte in Li-ion batteries. However, another important aspect was the acidic proton at the C-2 position of these imidazolium-derived ILs. The C-2 proton can be easily abstracted, and the deprotonated imidazolium core forms carbene (R = C:) which is highly reactive especially in contact with Li-metal anode undergoing side reactions [25]. These, in turn, cause detrimental effect over the battery cell electrode hampering its longevity. Substitution at the C-2 position will prevent generation of reactive carbenes. However, the replacement with an electron-withdrawing group leads to charge localization over the cation which further forms a strong cation-anion pair and hence increases the viscosity by several folds [30]. On the other hand, attachment of an electron-donating substituent causes a decreased charge which is delocalized over the cation, thereby weakening the ion pairing, and hence the increase in viscosity is comparatively lesser than the electronwithdrawing substituent [46]. Although C-2 substitution generally leads to a better thermal stability along with an enhanced ESW, the impact on viscosity is substantial. This fact was further detailed by Seki group [46] in their attempt to design the IL toward the improvement of both safety and performance by introducing an electrondonating substituent at the C-2 position.\nIt was observed that C-2 substituted 1,3-dialkyl imidazolium [similar to C8H14N2O2] IL shows a good ionic conductivity and most importantly it retained discharge characteristics even after 50 charge-discharge cycles as opposed to the unsubstituted 1,3-dialkyl imidazolium cation. Therefore it is evident that the substitution of C-2 position by a stable and nonreactive substituent further improves the overall ESW while retaining the charge-discharge profile to yield a stable cell capacity.\nInterestingly, the effect of C-2 substitution on the solvation properties of IL and their molecular dynamics were explored simultaneously from the perspective of the application as green electrolytes. The acidic C-2 hydrogen in unsubstituted variants is considered to provide hydrogen bonding interactions which dominate the ion solvation and cation-anion pairing, eventually affecting their melting point and viscosity. Detailed studies by IR spectroscopy and dynamics from time-resolved Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis suggest a negligible effect on the degree of interaction exhibited by 2-methyl-imidazolium core having the same anion [10]. Subsequently, the increase in the ordering of C-2 substituted imidazolium IL upon favorable cation-anion interaction was also proved by Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) NMR spectroscopy [1]. These experimental observations were then explored by Hunt [28] using ab initio quantum-chemical calculations to study the gas-phase ion pairs for 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium (unsubstituted, C9H15N2)\n11 Functionalized Ionic Liquid-Based Electrolytes for Li-Ion Batteries 419\nversus 1-butyl-2,3-dimethyl-imidazolium (C-2 substituted) chloride [C9H17ClN2] IL in an attempt to explain the increased melting point (mp) and viscosity for the latter. Although a reduced mp and decreased viscosity would be expected considering the loss of hydrogen bonding upon substitution, the observation is vice versa due to predominant entropy loss and leads to a greater ordering. The similar observation has also been supported experimentally having contribution from increased rotational hindrance from the butyl side chain at 1-position increasing both mp and viscosity. These effects were subsequently revisited by a host of consequent reports employing temperature-dependent FTIR studies [35], molecular dynamics simulations [53], large angle X-ray scattering (LAXS) [33], calorimetry along with Raman spectroscopy [13], combination of FTIR, Raman spectroscopy with NMR spectroscopy [39], rotational dynamic studies from NMR spectroscopy [12], and the like.\nFollowing these reports, the applicability of C-2 substituted ILs was explored as an electrolyte in Li-ion batteries. A study by Liao group [37] detailed the impact of varying the substituent as methyl, cyano, and ether moiety (-CH2OCH2CH2CH2CH3) which was correlated with the alteration in their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level. The cyano (-CN) group possesses a strong electronwithdrawing ability, thereby lowering LUMO which facilitates reduction ability of the imidazolium cation core decreasing the electrochemical stability window (ESW). However, ether moiety at C-2 along with a suitable substituent at 3 position raises the LUMO, enhanced its reduction stability while exhibiting lowest solid electrolyte interfacial resistance (RSEI), and also allowed for a high Li-ion transference number. In the following year, Jin group [30] reported an entire family of 30 etherfunctionalized ILs over a trialkyl imidazolium cation core with either one or two ether groups paired with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (LiC2F6NO4S2, TFSI\n) anion. A structure-physicochemical activity relationship was drawn based on their extensive characterizations which suggested that alkylation at C-2 position enhanced the cathodic stability, but lead to an increase in the size of cation allowing for an increase in viscosity. However, the incorporation of an ether substituent at the 1- and/or 3- positions, compensates the effect of C-2 substitution and thereby comparatively reduces the viscosity and mp. An important observation presented in this study was that incorporation of an ether substituent on the cation core having alkyl group at the C-2 position did not impact both the thermal and electrochemical stability.\nInsights obtained from these studies could further be improvised upon combining the favorable outcome of our detailed analysis wherein Im-1o2o2-H-2o1-TFSI (1) outperformed the siloxy-substituted imidazolium IL. This can be done by introducing a methyl substituent at the C-2 position which could possibly enhance the stability of the IL. However, to rationalize the substitutional effect, appropriately two variants were prepared, namely, an unsymmetrical Im-1o2o2-1-2o1-TFSI (4) IL and another symmetrical Im-1o2o2-1-2o2o1-TFSI (5) IL w.r.t. the ether substitution as shown in Scheme 11.2 and compared with IL (1).\nThe impact of C2 methyl on viscosity is expected to increase in these two ILs, which was studied by temperature-dependent (10–100 C) dynamic viscosity\n420 A. Tiwari et al.\nmeasurements under an inert atmosphere. The analysis further extended to study the variation upon blending with PC and also PC + LiTFSI and detailed in Table 11.5 and depicted in Fig. 11.5a, b.\nThe viscosity for neat ILs at 25 C shows that unsubstituted IL (1) possesses the least viscosity among the three ILs tested. This is in accordance with the previous discussion as the C-2 substitution is known to increase the viscosity of ILs. Another important observation is that the symmetrical IL (5) with the higher molecular weight has a viscosity of 135 mPa.s at 25 C, whereas the unsymmetrical IL (4) is ca. 1.4 times less viscous (98.7 mPa.s). This is attributed to the effect on tight ion pairing besides the molecular weight, where the unsymmetrical variant is imparting more flexibility and therefore lower extent of ordering. Further, the viscosity decreased considerably for all these ILs when blended with PC due to the reduced interionic interaction allowing better mobility. However, upon addition of (1 mol/kg) LiTFSI, an increase in viscosity by a factor of twowas observed in ILs + PC+LiTFSI. This could be explained on the basis of ion aggregation limiting the overall ionic\nTemp.

Further insight on ion aggregation can be possible by the study of selfdiffusion of different ions by pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR and different in situ spectroscopy measurements. The self-diffusion coefficient of Li-ion in IL + PC + LiTFSI was found to be 5.82 10 11 m2 s 1 for IL (4) two times higher than for IL (5) and ten times better than IL (1). The conductivity of ILs 4 and 5 was subsequently estimated by EIS studies similar to the previous set of ILs (1, 2, and 3). The unsymmetrical IL 4 exhibited a strikingly high conductivity of 13.5 mS cm 1 at 25 C which is ca. three times higher than IL 1 (4.6 mS cm 1) and 1.2 times higher than 5 (10.5 mS cm 1). However, the addition of PC to these ILs resulted in a drastic increase in conductivity to ca. 24 mS cm 1 for IL 5 and 31 for 4; however it was only 12.8 mS cm 1 for IL 1. Further, the IL + PC + LiTFSI mixture followed the trend 4 (8.7 mS cm 1) > 5 (5.3 mS cm 1) > 1 (2.2 mS cm 1). This trend of conductivity was found to support the viscosity and self-diffusion studies, and it is attributed that the effect of C-2 substitution on these imidazolium ILs is compensated by introducing ether functionality at the 1 and 3 positions of trialkyl imidazolium cation core.\nAlthough C-2 substitution leads to increased viscosity whereas conductivity is enhanced but the primary aim is the electrochemical stability enhancement, especially the reduction stability. The ESW was studied by linear sweep voltammetric measurements. Figure 11.5c, d depicts this response for all the three ILs, and their respective blends in the potential range 4 V to 5 V vs. Ag/Ag+/PC at a scan rate of 50 mV s 1. Similar to the previous study [8] detailed in Sect. 2, the ESW for neat IL (1), IL (4), and IL (5) along with its respective blends initially with PC only and subsequently with PC + LiTFSI is detailed in Table 11.6.\nStrikingly, the ESW at 25 C was enhanced by 900 mV for neat IL (5) and by 700 mV for IL (4) as compared to IL (1) which gives an experimental evidence for the increased stability upon C-2 substitution. This provides a physical correlation of the effect of substituting the acidic C-2 proton signifying that it otherwise involves in various side reactions hampering the cell’s output and cycling stability. Addition of PC to IL (1) led to decrease in ESW by 200 mV, but contrastingly, it was found to increase drastically (by 500 mV) for IL (4) and IL (5). Ideally, PC has a narrower ESW which caused the decrease for IL (1), but on C-2 methyl substitution, there is a possibility of enhanced interaction between PC and these substituents which eventually increased the ordering and hence ESW. The electrolyte blend resulting from a mixture of both PC and LiTFSI, on the other hand, further increases the ESW for all the three ILs which can be accounted for by the enhanced ion interaction due to Li-ion solvation.\nSubsequently, the thermal stability of these ILs was compared to account for C-2 substitution by TGA and DSC as in Fig. 11.6. TGA analysis under an inert atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 C min 1 in the range 30–800 C yielded only one major step for neat ILs corresponding to a weight loss of ca. 90% in the temperature range between 360 C and 490 C (Fig. 11.6a, b). The highest stability was displayed by the unsymmetrical IL (4) having a Tstart of 379.1 C which is comparable with IL (5) and 70 C higher than the C-2 unsubstituted IL (1). For PC + ILs, a two-step weight loss behavior was observed wherein the first one around 110 C to 250 C accounted for 15–20% weight loss and a Tstart between 360 C and\n11 Functionalized Ionic Liquid-Based Electrolytes for Li-Ion Batteries 423"

Additionally, DSC measurements (Fig. 11.6c, d) in the temperature range 90 to 20 C (at 5 C min 1) revealed the lowest glass transition temperature (Tg) for unsubstituted IL (1) which was comparable to the unsymmetrical IL (4) while being lowest for the symmetrical IL (5) [i.e., 74.5 C > 70.6 C > 68.2 C]. This lower working temperature limit was enhanced upon PC addition which further decreased in IL + PC + LiTFSI; however the trend remained the same."

      "text" : "The safety aspect of the battery technology is of utmost importance irrespective of the obtainable capacity especially when it is composed of a highly flammable component as in the case of Li-ion batteries. The most widely employed electrolyte system comprises of the organic electrolyte mixture which provides high conductivity at the cost of safety owing to their flammable nature which has proven\ndisastrous in the past under stressed conditions causing thermal runaways. The electrolytes composed of the highly stable ionic liquids with a wide liquid range, high thermal stability, and substantial conductivity would be a reasonable alternative to the present thermally unstable electrolytes in practice. The elaborate study of two newly designed imidazolium ILs functionalized with ether-ether and ether-siloxane was analyzed toward each aspect of an electrolyte ranging from the potential stability, conductivity, viscosity, thermal stability, and electrolyte range to battery testing. The electrolyte system was also modified with 55 mol % of the organic solvent, viz., propylene carbonate as an additive to accelerate the SEI layer formation and stabilization along with 1 mol LiTFSI/kg solvent as the source of Li-ion. Preliminary testing of both the IL systems suggested E-E-based electrolyte possesses high stability both thermal and electrochemical with heightened conductivity toward Li-ions even in the presence of high Li-ion content. High LiTFSI concentration causes severe issues by aggregated cluster formation in the form of Li TFSI½ n nþ1 species which hamper the mobility of Li-ions during the charge-discharge process. The ether-ether substituent on the imidazolium core of the cation bestows side chain flexibility reducing the ion symmetry resulting into a diffused cation which upon teaming up with a large diffused anion, namely, TFSI, interacts electrostatically overcoming the tendency of cluster formation. Besides the ether functionality aids in holding more Li-ions for its shuttling safely during the charge-discharge process proving to be an appropriate and potential electrolyte in Li-ion batteries. Further, the stability issue resulting in limited cycling was addressed by eliminating the acidic C-2 proton by methyl. This C-2 methyl imidazolium IL with ether functionalities unsymmetrically substituted at 1 and 3 positions provided a suitable combination to be explored further for a probable Li-ion battery electrolyte application. Functionalized ionic liquids therefore hold a unique potential of wide fluidity and stability which lends a new direction toward fine-tuning its cationic and anionic components to achieve a safe electrolyte for Li-ion batteries.\nAcknowledgments This research is supported by the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), India (2013/37C/57/BRNS).

      "text" : "The rapid development of highly functional cathode has been one of the central issues in lithium-ion battery (LIB) research; thus intensive studies have been conducted after its emergence into commercial market decades ago. Approaches for improving the cathode performance can be classified into three types as schematically illustrated in Fig. 12.1: the development of novel functional materials, manipulating interface for faster electrochemistry, and controlling microstructure for better multi-physics of electrochemical reaction and mass transport. The examples of the former two can be found much in literature and other chapters of this book; therefore, this chapter will focus on the final approach. In general, to increase the storage density of LIB, thicker cathode with a higher portion of active material particles is favored, which usually results in lower output power density limited by mass transfer processes involved in electrode reaction. Thus, it is demanded to optimize microstructure for cathode with both higher storage density and output power density at the same time. However, the complexity of the cathode microstructure has been a big obstacle for analyzing elementary processes. Therefore, traditional researches aiming at optimization of microstructure have been researches investigating electrode characteristics as a function of conditions of the\n430 M. Koyama and B. Javed\nfabrication process as parameters. Though such approach is important to accumulate tacit process knowledge and useful for establishing fabrication recipes of the better electrode, breakthroughs are awaited in order to obtain mechanistic and essential understandings, which will be inevitable to design electrode, for example, free from failures with microstructure origin.\nLIB cathode typically consists of active material, a conductive additive, binder, and electrolyte. Those components interact with each other, forming a complicated structure field for lithium-ion transfer, charge-transfer, and electron transfer. To best design the cathode microstructure, understanding the rate-limiting process is important. In fact, one can see that single-particle cathode, which is free from the complexity of the microstructure, shows an excellent performance [1–7]; e.g., ca. 75% of capacity is retained in the single-particle cathode of lithium cobalt oxide (LixCoO2) even at a high discharge rate of 300 C [1]. A large difference with actual operation in automobile application is not only due to the limitations of heat dissipations for securing the safety but also due to the different rate-limiting process in the composite electrode system. The effort to quantify the relation between the complex microstructure of battery electrodes and the charge/discharge characteristics is driven by the utilization of focused-ion-beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and nano/micro-X-ray computed tomography (CT), which can analyze the actual electrode microstructure three-dimensionally followed by computer reconstructions [8–15]. When we apply those technologies to the composite cathode systems, we can easily differentiate the active materials and other phases; however, it is difficult to differentiate conductive additive, binder, and void filled by the liquid electrolyte. This makes virtual modeling approaches [16–22] alternatively useful and effective to understand the multiphysics in composite electrode. We can find pioneering studies applying virtual modeling to LIB. In the past several years, many studies have addressed the issue of the influence of the composite cathode microstructure. Goldin et al. have carefully discussed the influence of microstructure on the discharge characteristics of LIBs based on the electrode structures represented as orderly packed spheres [20]. Latz and Zausch have performed a multi-scale simulation of LIBs using a three-dimensional structure model based on the homogenization method [21]. However, most of those explicitly consider active materials only, and the gap between such a simplified structure and the actual composite structure is needed to be bridged if we target the simulation-driven microstructure optimization. In this chapter, we will introduce an example of such efforts by Kikukawa et al. [16]."

In addition, the\n12 Multi-physics Simulation of Charge-Transfer Reaction and Mass Transport in. . . 431\nexistence of an interface between particles should be noted as a difference between the single particle and composite cathodes. Kikukawa et al. have modeled the composite cathode as schematically illustrated in Fig. 12.2. First, three distinct phases of active materials, conductive additive, and binder are randomly packed into the simulation cell by using a porous structure simulator [19]. Note that the overlap of each entity is permitted; thus two-dimensional interfaces are formed. The open void will be assumed to be filled with liquid electrolyte in the later finite element simulation. Here, it is noted that the boundary between active materials is treated explicitly by inserting a circular disc to discuss its influence on the discharge characteristics. Then, an in-house code is used to generate the two-dimensional image along the thickness direction by defining the appropriate unit step. At each unit step, the 2D slice and view images are saved and are further used to generate a three-dimensional voxel model by importing them in a three-dimensional image data processing software, AVIZO [23]. Finally, meshes for finite element simulation are generated from the voxel model by using a function available in multi-physics simulation package, COMSOL Multiphysics® [24]. This process is compatible with the process of the three-dimensional reconstruction based on FIB-SEM, while it should be noted that the clear identification of interface between particles is a remaining big challenge.\n432 M.

      "text" : "Based on the constructed composite cathode structure model, multi-physics of charge-transfer reaction and mass transfer was simulated by finite element method. The following elementary physics are considered for each component phase of the composite cathode, which is also illustrated in Fig. 12.3a.\n• Electron conduction: Active material, a conductive additive, current collector, and the interface between those components. • Lithium diffusion: Active material, and the interface between active materials. • Lithium-ion conduction: Electrolyte. • Charge-transfer reaction: Interface between active material and electrolyte.\nNote that binder is treated as inert phase just acting as inhibition phase; thus no physics are applied. In addition, it is noted that the interface between active materials is modeled as a separate phase; therefore, the parameters different from bulk active\n12 Multi-physics Simulation of Charge-Transfer Reaction and Mass Transport in. . . 433\nmaterial phase can be set. Butler-Volmer equation was adopted to represent the charge-transfer reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In addition, film resistance is set referring to the preceding literature [25]. Further details are available in the original manuscript [16].\nLixCoO2 and carbon were assumed as an active material and a conductive additive, respectively. 1 mol/dm3 of lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) solvated in propylene carbonate (C4H6O3), and ethylene carbonate (C3H4O3) mixture with the composition of 1:1 v/v was assumed as electrolyte [4].\nAnother difficulty in the multi-physics simulation of the composite cathode is the reliability of the physical properties. Conventionally, complex microstructure and physics are simplified in many of preceding studies [14, 17–22, 26]. Of course, we must admit that simulation results from such simplified models are very useful for the interpretations of observable charge/discharge characteristics. However, we will notice that different parameters are set for, for example, the same physical properties if we closely examine those preceding studies. This will be associated with the parameter fitting process in that simulation, typically conducted in order to reproduce the experimentally observed characteristics. In the parameter fitting process, parameters such as physical property values are changed usually; however, parameters determined in such a way result in the values into which many differences between experiment and simulation models. Therefore, those parameters do not represent the intrinsic parameters of component materials. Because unphysical parameters will result in unphysical simulation even if the macroscopic observation superficially agrees, one needs to carefully consider this issue in order to transferrable and predictive simulations.\nTo counter the abovementioned issue, Kikukawa et al. have first determined parameters to reproduce the discharge characteristics of single-particle cathode, comprising of a simple structure, easy to be modeled. Figure 12.3b shows the schematic description of the single-particle simulation model along with the necessary boundary conditions. Parameters determined for simple structure cathode will represent more intrinsic physical properties and should be used for the subsequent simulations of the composite cathode with complex microstructure. Kikukawa et al. have carefully examined parameters of the diffusion coefficient of lithium (Li) in active material, the conductivity of the active material, the rate constant for exchange current density, and film resistance of an active material to reproduce experimental observations by Dokko et al. [4]. They have determined lithium diffusion coefficient in active material as 3 10 13 m2 s 1. Here, we would introduce another example of parameter determination to discuss the reliability of the parameter values. Figure 12.4 shows the comparison of experimental discharge characteristics and simulation results obtained after revisiting the parameters determined by Kikukawa et al. for more precision. Among the shown curves with different diffusion coefficient values, one can see that the value of 2 10 13 m2 s 1 shows the best agreement with experimental observations especially up to the current of 20 nA, which is actually better than the curves by Kikukawa et al. in terms of both the initial voltage and capacity retention ratio. This means that we should admit such range of determined\n434 M. Koyama and B. Javed\nvalue as reliability of the parameters; however, we can understand that the diffusion coefficient values of active materials with the magnitude of 10 13 m2 s 1, which is much larger than values reported in simulation researches such as 3.7 10 16 m2 s 1 [20] and 1 10 14 m2 s 1 [26], can reproduce the single-particle cathode characteristics well. Note that the values of 10 13 m2 s 1 are in good agreement with a recent experimental report [27].\nKikukawa et al. have next simulated the discharge characteristics of the composite cathode using the parameters determined to reproduce the characteristics of single-particle cathode. Initially, they have simulated the discharge characteristics of cathode without the conductive additive at 10 C. As seen in Fig. 12.5a, very high capacity retention was obtained at the discharge rate of 10 C even without conductive additive if they do not set any interparticle resistance between active materials. As the relative interparticle resistance, which is defined as the ratio of interfacial resistivity against that of the bulk, increases, the capacity retention decreases. When the carbon is added as a conductive additive, the capacity retention is recovered as shown in Fig. 12.5b. This observed tendency clearly shows the necessity of conductive additive to retain the capacity at high discharge rate, which have provided an alternative path for the electrons to travel. In addition, it indicates that the resistance between active materials, which does not exist in single-particle cathode, will limit the capacity of the composite cathode at high discharge rate.\nFigure 12.6 shows the discharge characteristics of the composite cathode with the thickness of 30 and 60 μm. Note that relative interparticle resistivity between active materials of 104 was assumed in the simulation. When the cathode thickness is 30 μm, high capacity retention was achieved even at a high discharge rate of 10 C as shown in Fig. 12.6a. On the other hand, 60% and 30% of capacity retention were estimated at the discharge rate of 5 C and 10 C, respectively, from the simulation for 60-μm-thick cathode as seen from Fig. 12.6b.\nTo see the reason more closely, concentration profile in composite cathode visualized in Fig. 12.7 that shows the lithium-ion concentration within the electrolyte phase (Fig. 12.7a, b). Lithium concentration is homogeneous at the early stage of discharge in both 30- and 60-μm-thick cathodes. Lithium-ion concentration near the current collector side gradually becomes scarce in 30-μm-thick composite cathode as the discharge reaches intermediate and final stages (Fig. 12.7a). On the contrary, lithium-ion concentration within 60-μmthick composite cathode becomes very scarce even at the intermediate stage of discharge (Fig. 12.7b). This clearly shows the typical lithium-ion depletion in the electrolyte phase of composite cathode. Figure 12.7c, d show the lithium concentration within the active material phase of the composite cathode at the final stage of the discharge. Lithium-ion is homogeneously inserted into active materials in the 30-μm-thick composite cathode; thus, only a limited number of active materials with slightly lower concentration are noticed near the current collector side at high discharge capacity of 10 C (Fig. 12.7c). From Fig. 12.7d, homogeneous insertion was achieved at the discharge rates of 0.2 and 1 C in 60-μm-thick\n436 M. Koyama and B. Javed\ncomposite cathode, and insufficient insertion near the current collector side was noticed at 5 C. One can clearly see that the insertion only occurs near the separator side at 10 C, corresponding to the lithium-ion depletion in the electrolyte phase shown in Fig. 12.6d. We should note that those results qualitatively reproduce the experimental observations; therefore, the next step is the validation against experimental observations, which will be a starting point toward the computer-aided design of composite cathode microstructure."

As results of the development of electrolytes with high conductivity comparable to that of the liquid electrolyte, many efforts are devoted to achieving the characteristics satisfying the specifications required for an automobile or stationary applications. Following the approach for liquid electrolyte LIB described in the preceding section, the existence\nof various interfaces determines the charge/discharge characteristics of the practical composite cathode, the simulations considering interfacial resistances will help in the design of composite cathode for SSB.\nAs a first step, we have conducted preliminary simulations of SSB composite cathode considering interfacial resistances as schematically illustrated in Fig. 12.8.\nThe composite cathode is modeled by packing active material and solid electrolyte particles represented by spheres. In the model, interfaces between active material particles, electrolyte particles, and active material-electrolyte particles can be explicitly considered, to investigate each contribution to the charge/ discharge characteristics of the composite cathode. As a first step to see the influence of interfacial resistance, simulations of SSB cathode are conducted assuming LixCoO2 as the active material. Physical properties determined for single-particle cathode was adopted [16], and other parameters, such as rate constant for exchange current density at the interface between active material and electrolyte, are tentatively set as same as those in liquid electrolyte LIB system. The influence of relative interparticle resistivity between solid electrolyte particles is investigated. As seen in Fig. 12.8, capacity retention drastically decreases as the relative interparticle resistivity increases at the discharge rate of 10 C. It is apparent that the battery no more works when the relative interparticle resistivity is 103. Correspondingly, the lithium concentration within active material becomes non-ideal at high relative interparticle resistivity.\n440 M. Koyama and B.

The second is to incorporate the microstructure of actual cathode into the simulation. This requires the advancement of reconstructions from FIB-SEM or X-ray CT observations. The final one is the multi-scale simulation. As results of the advancements of computers and theoretical methods, many atomiclevel insights on the interfaces are reported. Also, we can find considerable numbers of experimental reports on the atomically well-defined model interface systems.

      "heading" : "13.1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are prerequisites for designing advanced electrode materials. The application of a battery is actually conversing chemical energy into electricity to provide energy. Complete mass transfer for LIBs during battery application includes electrons transfer via out circuit and Li+ transport inside the battery cell. As a result, Li atoms move from anode side to cathode side, and the cell provides electricity to the environment during discharge process. The driving force for such a process is actually different Li chemical potentials (μLi) at anode and cathode sides. Chemical potential of Li mainly depends on electrode composition, temperature, and crystal structure, in short, the state of electrodes. This critical information for LIBs can be describe using phase diagrams, which are also called as state diagrams. Therefore, phase diagrams, that often provide quantitative relationship of the composition and temperature, are useful thinking tools as suggested in [1] to help understanding the fundamental electrochemical properties of electrodes. The phase diagrams can be under equilibrium condition or metastable state with some phases being suspended. With given composition and other conditions in phase diagram, operating voltage as well as other electrochemical behaviors of Li-ion batteries can be predicated, especially using thermodynamic descriptions constructed using Calphad approach.\nThe Calphad approach, shorted from Calculation of phase diagrams, together with computational thermodynamics has reached majority providing a powerful tool for new materials exploration. This approach includes two sections. First is development of self-consistent thermodynamic databases. The second part is calculation of different types of phase diagrams and property diagrams for a wide field of applications. Originally, Calphad only refers to the first part and the computational thermodynamics for the second, but now researchers gradually use Calphad as an integrated approach for both database development and following calculations for applications.\nRelating to the application of Li-ion batteries, the chemical potential phase diagrams provide more information on the electrochemical properties of the system. The chemical potential of Li from the Calphad calculation is related to the electromotive force (emf), E, by the Nernst equation:\n446 D. Li et al.\nμLi μo,refLi ¼ nFE (13:1) where F is Faraday’s constant and n the number of electrons, n = 1 for Li. This voltage is also denoted as equilibrium open-circuit voltage (OCV).\nSuccessful applications of Calphad approach relay on reliability of multicomponent databases, for which subsystems must be previously assessed. The core of a thermodynamic database for Calphad approach is a set of thermodynamic description of Gibbs energy of all phases, which include specific models and values of adjustable parameters. In order to develop a reliable thermodynamic description of an alloy system, all available experimental and theoretical data have to be collected and evaluated thoroughly. Then, one must select proper models for all the phases in the system. At last, parameters of corresponding Gibbs energy functions are optimized based on all weighted experimental and theoretical data using optimization software packages, often through least square method. Currently, commercial software packages are Thermo-calc, Pandat, FactSage, and MatData, and two open-source software packages are OpenCalphad and Pycalphad.\nIt must be stressed a reliable thermodynamic description reproduces not only correlating phase boundaries but also the correct Gibbs energy values under different conditions. Precise reproducibility of phase diagram data, e.g., phase boundaries, is often considered as the most important judging factor for the qualities of a database. But as described previously, the Calphad approach detect the minimum overall Gibbs energy by distributing the components into different phases, whose Gibbs energy has been given as functions of temperature, compositions, etc. Therefore, incorrect Gibbs energy functions for individual phases may also lead to similar phase relations to the reality when specific relation is fulfilled. However, this kind of unrealistic description cannot provide useful thermochemical information such as chemical potential from which OCV is calculated. A schematic example is given in Fig. 13.1, where blue and red curves show the “correct” and “wrong” Gibbs energy curves of α and β phases, respectively. The two vertical lines in Fig. 13.1 show the phase boundaries of α and β phases in equilibrium with each other, which are points of contact of corresponding common tangents with Gibbs energy curves. Clearly, the two sets of Gibbs energy descriptions lead to the same phase boundaries on the phase diagram. However, the corresponding chemical potential of element a and b is far away from each other, as shown in Fig. 13.1 as the end points of the common tangents at pure a or b compositions. According to Nernst equation (13.1), they will make different predications for the OCV when a or b is the charge carrier.\nA multicomponent database is constructed by combining fully accessed selfconsistent thermodynamic descriptions of all binary, ternary, and quaternary subsystems. Systems with more than four elements are essentially based on certain extrapolation schemes. With well-developed thermodynamic database, a series of the phase diagrams and property diagrams are able to be calculated. In addition to the typical composition and temperature relationship phase diagram, the chemical potential phase diagrams and property diagrams, such as OCV and Gibbs energy of formation, are of great interests for the Li-ion battery application. A hypothetical Li-ion battery with Si-Sn mixed conductor anode and Li-Mn-O spinel cathode will be given as an example in the following text.\n13 Operating Voltage of Li-Ion Batteries on the Basis of Phase Diagram and. . . 447"

A specific example of the OCV curves at 415 C is shown in Fig. 13.4a by comparing the Calphad calculation [2] with the experimental data [3].\nCompared to the equilibrium state at elevated temperature, the Li lithiation and delithiation at room temperature under metastable state is of more interest for exploring the properties of Si as anode in Li-ion batteries, as the charging and discharging process of the battery is often in non-equilibrium state. A method for OCV curves involving the metastable Li15Si4 phase and amorphous Si(Li) phase was developed based on Calphad approach [2]. The Gibbs energy of the Li-Si amorphous alloys is described by the extrapolation of Gibbs energy of the undercooled liquid phase. Neglecting the kinetic factors, the Calphad calculated metastable OCV curves are surprisingly in qualitatively good agreement with the experimental data as shown in Fig. 13.4b."

      "text" : "mixed conductor, three requirements must be fulfilled:\n• The matrix compound is a good electronic conductor. • High diffusion coefficient of Li in both reactant and matrix compound. • Reactant and matrix compound does not react with each other.\nIn the work of Boukamp and Huggins [1, 12], Si and Sn mixture was chosen as illustrating example because they meet all the three requirements. The first two is obvious as both Si and Sn are solely anode candidates for Li-ion batteries. Figure 13.9 shows calculated Sn-Si phase diagram using parameters reported in COST 507 database [13], where no Sn-Si compound, even obvious solubility in the liquid phase, can be observed below 500 C.\nNevertheless, Boukamp and Huggins [1, 12] started with a mixture of Si Li2.6Sn with Si/Sn ratio as 0.671. Therefore, Li-Si-Sn dataset combined using Li-Si [2], Li-Sn [6], and Si-Sn [13] binary description was applied for necessary calculation.\nFigure 13.10 shows calculated Li-Si-Sn isothermal section at 415 C as the experimental condition of Boukamp and Huggins [1, 12]. According to Fig. 13.10, their starting composition locates at the edge of Si + LiSi + Li13Sn5 ternary phase field without appearance of liquid.\nFigure 13.11a shows calculated emf curve by lithithing a Si-Sn alloy with nSi: nSn = 0.671 at 415 C. One can see many voltage plateaus corresponding to different ternary phase regions on the Li-Si-Sn isothermal section. The emf profile measured by Boukamp and Huggins [1, 12] is shown in Fig. 13.11b, starting with a two-phase mixture Si + Li13Sn5, ending up with Li13Sn5 + Li7Sn2 + Li7Sn3. A good agreement between calculation and experimental results can be observed. The entire calculated curve locates between measured charge and discharge profiles. The calculated vertical sections, which correspond to phase boundaries between different three-phase regions, also agree well with the experimental results. Because the calculation and experimental results are independent from each other, the good agreement between the measurement and calculation is a strong evidence that the current combined thermodynamic description can reliably predict corresponding battery behaviors.\nAlthough high temperatures are more suitable for laboratory investigations due to fast kinetic, most battery applications are at room temperature. Figure 13.12 shows calculated Li-Sn-Sn isothermal section at room temperature, which consists of 12 three-phase regions. In each three-phase region, the chemical potential of Li is a constant, corresponding to a fixed emf potential for the battery application. Figure 13.13 shows calculated OCV curves when adding Li into 1 molar Si-Sn mixture at room temperature under equilibrium state. Besides the two initial conditions starting with pure Si or Sn, each OCV curve contains 12 voltage plateaus, corresponding to the 12 three-phase regions shown in Fig. 13.12. Lithiation process of a Si-Sn mixed conductor is given in Table 13.1.\nThe maximum capability is not changed with initial composition because the Li-richest compounds are Li17Si4 and Li17Sn4 for Si and Sn, respectively. With different initial Si-Sn compositions, the voltage plateaus have different capacities. Naturally, even distribution of capacity to different voltage plateaus, which correspond to different reactions, plus alternative reaction with Si and Sn can avoid accumulation of internal forces in the electrode materials and brake of the active materials. As shown in Fig. 13.13, when Si and Sn amount is close to each other (x= 0.4 and 0.6), the overall OCV curve looks smoother than other compositions. If we take into consideration that the molar mass of Si and Sn are 28.09 and\n118.71 g mol 1, respectively, higher Si content is always preferred for its higher mass capacity. Additionally, as the overall battery potential is the difference of electric potential of Li between anode side and cathode side, this is essential for the battery performance design and evaluation."

      "text" : "Li-Mn-O spinel is a series of attractive cathode materials for rechargeable lithiumion batteries. However, a wide range of solid solution can be directly sintered within the Li-Mn-O spinel compound composition range. Moreover, the battery-related properties of sintered Li-Mn-O spinels can differ from each other even with the same composition when sintering process has been changed. This makes it difficult to understand its intrinsic properties and evaluate relating battery performance. To overcome this difficulty, a high-throughput computational framework based on the Calphad approach was developed [14] to systematically describe the intrinsic properties of the Li-Mn-O spinel compounds under the “sintered” and “battery” states, indicating the cathode material states just sintered and during battery operations, respectively. Calculated room temperature phase diagrams of the Li-Mn-O system for “sintered state” and “battery state” are shown in Fig. 13.14a, b, respectively.\nOne critical cathode material property, which is essential for the safety of lithium-ion battery, is stability, which means (1) there is stable temperature/composition range of the electrode and (2) cathode material may release oxygen under battery operation when it reaches certain composition/temperature. Enthalpy of formation represents thermodynamic stability of the electrodematerials. Figure 13.15 shows calculated enthalpies of formation per mole atom for spinel based on the “sintered state” within LiMn2O4 Li4Mn5O12 Li2Mn4O9 composition triangle\n13 Operating Voltage of Li-Ion Batteries on the Basis of Phase Diagram and. . . 455\nand “battery state” within LiMn2O4 Li4Mn5O12 λ MnO2 composition triangle. Enthalpy of formation under “sintered state” becomes more negative from Li2Mn4O9 compound to LiMn2O4 Li4Mn5O12 edge. Therefore, Li1 + yMn2 yO4 (0 y 0.33) is more stable than the Li2Mn4O9 stoichiometric compound. The calculated enthalpies of formation of the Li1 + yMn2 yO4 (0 y 0.33) spinels increase slightly with decreasing lithium content, indicating a slightly decreased thermodynamic stability. An increment of enthalpies of formation of Li1 wMn2O4 (0 w 1) spinels under the “battery state” leads to the decreasing phase stability during the delithiation (charge of battery) process.\nFigure 13.16a, b shows calculated voltage-composition profiles of Li/LixMn2O4(0 x 2) and Li/LixMn1.85O4(0 x 2) at room temperature along with the literature data [15, 16]. LiMn2O4 as electrode material provides the possibility of both Li extraction and insertion. In the spinel single-phase region (0 x 1), Li-ions on the 8a sites undergo intercalation/deintercalation around 4 V. Once the phase transition from the spinel LiMn2O4 to tetragonal t LiMnO2 because of the Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn3+ ion, the voltage drops suddenly to 2.95 V at x = 1 and remains at this value in the two-phase region (1 x 2). Compared to LiMn2O4, Li1.15Mn1.85O4 displays more complicated electrochemical behavior during cycling. In the spinel single-phase region (0.60 x 1.15), the voltage plateau is around 4 V. When the composition is 1.15 x 1.375, the voltage plateau is around 3.1 V in the spinel + Li2MnO3 two-phase region. Li2MnO3 particles can facilitate Li-ion transport in the cathode material and benefit the cyclability of the Li-ion battery [17]. Further discharge to 1.375 x 2, a flat 2.95 V plateau can be observed in the spinel+Li2MnO3 + t LiMnO2 three-phase region. In this region, the formation of the t-LiMnO2 via the Jahn-Teller distortion leads to\n13 Operating Voltage of Li-Ion Batteries on the Basis of Phase Diagram and. . . 457\nthe capacity loss. Therefore, the spinel + Li2MnO3 two-phase region can act as a buffer region, which can prohibit the Jahn-Teller distortion during battery operation under non-equilibrium state. Figure 13.16c shows calculated cell voltage relating to composition within the t LiMnO2 Li2MnO3 λ MnO2 triangle. Obviously, different Li activities in different phase regions lead to different voltage plateaus. The spinel single phase is related to the upper 4 V voltage plateau. Around 3.1 V voltage plateau is due to coexistence of the spinel + Li2MnO3 phases. The voltage within the three-phase spinel+ Li2MnO3 + t LiMnO2 region is 2.95 V flat plateau."

A schematic drawing of such an electrochemical cell is given in Fig. 13.17 for its initial state.

Therefore, when 4.25nA = nC, all Li can move between anode and cathode materials using 100% charge capacity of both sides.\nCalculated emf curves using a cell composed by 1 mol 0.6Si–0.4 Sn anode and 4.25 mol LiMn2O4 cathode material are shown in Fig. 13.18 for (a) electrodes and (b) complete cell.

At the current state of Li-ion battery development, charge capacity is limited by cathode material due to its small theoretical capacity compared to anode materials. Additionally, cathode price is much higher than that of anode materials. From the other side, cyclability is a more severe problem than charge capacity for alloy-type anodes, such as the Si-Sn mixture conductor. Therefore, extra Si-Sn anode material may be matched with LiMn2O4 cathode to be able to use the full capacity of cathode material and avoid cell capacity loss when part of the anode material is degenerated. Additionally, composition of anode material will not cross all three-phase regions, which means, less voltage plateaus will appear during charge/discharge process. If only part of the total possible compositions at the anode side will be used, it is possible to select the “active” composition range by adding certain amount of Li to the initial anode material.\nBy looking at the complete emf curve during lithiation/delithiation of the 0.6Si–0.4Sn material (Fig. 13.13), we can find that the first several plateaus\ncorresponding to Li-Sn reactions show relatively big voltage jump at phase boundaries and could be avoided.\nComposition range from Si-Li13Sn5 to Li7Si3 - Li17Sn4 is selected as an example because of the containing reactions during lithiation/delithiation process. From Table 13.1, one can see this corresponds to an upper voltage limit between 0.37 V and 0.45 V and a lower voltage between 0.26 V and 0.22 V and includes three reaction steps between Li and Si followed by two reaction steps between Li and Sn. For 1 mol selected 0.6Si–0.4Sn material, the limit amount of Li is calculated to be 1.04 mol and 3.1 mol, with difference of 2.06 mol. This means, the starting Si-Li13Sn5 material with 0.6 mol Si and 0.4 mol Sn should match with 2.06 mol LiMn2O4. The calculated emf for the anode and cathode material with different SOC is given in Fig. 13.19.\nComparing the emf profiles given in Figs. 13.18 and 13.19, one can see the OCV of entire cell is smoother and flatter with partially lithiation/delithiation process of Si-Sn anode material, which is beneficial for battery management system. Certainly, more variations such as Li-rich spinel can be used for simulating cell performance, but they will be skipped from the current text."

The increases in greenhouse gases at the present trajectory will increase the global warming potential above the 2 threshold. At this threshold, it is anticipated that climate changes will adversely affect the land and sea masses. To minimize the potential of global warming and meet the increased energy demands, high-energy capacity lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries in portable electronics and electric vehicles offer one potential solution. Current Li-ion chemistries focus on lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM), lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), and lithium titanium oxide (LTO) as cathodes and lithium metal (Li-metal) as an anode. Other semiconductor materials are used as alloying anodes (Si, Sn) that also include chalcogenides (S), metal halides (Br), and polymers. These materials enable the cell to maintain a high charge density through enhanced Li and electron transport, lesser volumetric expansion, material dissolution, and surface reactions between electrode and electrolyte generating heat. In part, battery thermal management is controlled using passive cooling in addition to liquid cooling. However, the widespread usage of Li-ion batteries in electric vehicles also presents a problem in end-of-life disposal and adverse effects on leaching of active materials into the water table.
