      "text" : "With the development of photocatalytic technology, photocatalytic degradation of\npollutants, photocatalytic disinfection and water splitting have been attracting more and more attention [1-6]. Due to the advantages of non-toxic, cheap, stable and reusable photocatalysts, photocatalytic treatment and degradation of pollutants have become a research hotspot in the field of environment. In addition, the operating conditions of the technology are facile to control and the oxidation ability is very strong. It can completely degrade the organic pollutants contained in water into water and carbon dioxide, etc, because the electrons and holes generated by photocatalyst after irradiation can react with oxygen and hydroxyl ions in water to produce strong oxidative active free radicals. Photocatalytic water splitting has also made great progress in recent years [7-14], but it still faces great challenges [15-20]. From the perspective of thermodynamics and kinetics, the key step in water splitting is the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on Jo ur\nna l P\nr -p\nr f\nthe anode. Compared with the two-electron hydrogen evolution process, the oxygen evolution process requires four-electron transfer, so it becomes the bottleneck of limiting the overall catalytic activity in the water splitting reaction [21-24]. It is very important to accumulate a large number of holes on the surface of the catalyst to increase the rate of oxidation, thereby reducing the overpotential required for the oxidation process.\nDespite many significant advances have been made in the field of photocatalysis,\nthe photocatalytic efficiency of photocatalysts is still low and far away from practical application. This is mainly due to the easy recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes in semiconductors and the low light-harvesting capability [25-28]. Since the two-dimensional (2D) material has a very high surface area-volume ratio and can effectively separate photoinduced electrons and holes, exfoliating the layered material into a few layer 2D material can significantly improve the photocatalytic activity [29-32]. In addition, due to the high specific surface area of 2D materials, more pollutants can be touched on the surface of particles. As a heterogeneous photocatalyst, a larger contact area can increase the photocatalytic efficiency. In recent years, graphene-like 2D layered materials have attracted much attention due to their controllable chemical composition, abundant chemical valence states, high electrochemical active sites, unique crystal structure and electronic structure [33-36]. Black phosphorus (BP) has recently emerged as an interesting 2D layered semiconductor with high charge-carrier mobility and widely tunable bandgap for photocatalysis [37-39]. BP is also a 2D material of single element, similar to graphite, whose atomic layers are stacked together by van der Waals force interaction. In a single layer, each phosphorus atom combines with three adjacent phosphorus atoms in the form of covalent bonds to form a folded honeycomb structure. BP exhibits high carrier mobility, excellent optical and optoelectronic properties, and high mechanical properties. Compared with bulk BP, nanocrystallized BP possesses larger specific surface area and higher electron mobility. Currently reported nano-BP includes zero-dimensional BP quantum dots and 2D BP nanosheets. At present, the main preparation methods of nano-BP are mechanical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, liquid phase exfoliation and solvothermal Jo ur na l P re -p ro of\nmethod [40-42].\nIn order to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of BP, various modification\nstrategies have been studied, including semiconductor anion and cation doping, surface coating, construction of heterostructure, etc. Among them, the construction of heterojunction photocatalysts with efficient light-harvesting and fast charge transfer is one of the widely used methods to enhance the photocatalytic properties. The reason for this is that the heterojunction is conducive to the transfer and spatial separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs between two semiconductors, to reduce their combination, and to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of the system. Wang and his co-workers [43] developed the binary BP/g-C3N4 heterostructure photocatalyst, which exhibited excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity in the generation of ·O2- and H2O2. Zhu et al. [44, 45] constructed BP/g-C3N4 and BP/BiVO4 heterojunctions, respectively. They exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance in H2 evolution from visible to near-infrared region and pure-water splitting in the visible-light region. Nevertheless, as a reduction type semiconductor, it is more suitable for BP to construct heterojunctions by selecting a semiconductor with strong oxidation or lower valence band position to match its energy band structure. As a highly anisotropic layered semiconductor, BiOBr possesses excellent photocatalytic activity [46-48]. While, it has a lower valence band position and stronger oxidation ability. In addition, BiOBr prepared by different methods is thin layers or spherical structures consisting of thin layers with a thickness of only a few nanometers, which is very useful for promoting the transfer and separation of electron-hole pairs [49-51]. However, up to now, there is no report on BP/BiOBr heterojunction. We found that the energy levels of BP and BiOBr are matched, which is suitable for highly efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Therefore, for the first time, we tried to construct layered BP/BiOBr nanoheterojunction for photocatalytic application.\nIt is well known that the combination of a reduction and an oxidation\nsemiconductor generally forms a conventional Ⅱ-type heterojunction. However, more and more studies have pointed out that a more reasonable explanation is the direct Zscheme heterojunction mechanism [2, 3, 10-12, 27, 45, 52-54]. Recently, on the basis of direct\nJo ur\nal Pr\nepr\noo f\nZ-scheme heterojunction mechanism, Yu et al. [55] proposed a new concept of S-scheme heterojunction. The S-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is mainly composed of two n-type semiconductor photocatalysts i.e., PS I and PS II, and they represent oxidation and reduction photocatalyst, respectively. The transfer of photogenerated electrons in S-scheme heterojunction is more like “Step”. The driving force of charge carrier transfer mainly comes from the internal electric field. In S-scheme heterojunction, the relatively useless electrons in the CB of PS I and the relatively useless holes in the VB of PS II are recombined at the interface. In contrast, the useful holes in the VB of PS I and the useful electrons in the CB of PS II are retained due to the presence of the internal electric field. Therefore, in order to construct the S-scheme heterojunction, the VB energy level of the useless holes should be as close as possible to the CB energy level of the other semiconductor where the useless electrons are located.\nIn this study, in order to obtain a unique layered BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction\nwith intimate interfacial contact, BiOBr nanosheets were self-assembled on a few layers of BP surface by liquid-phase ultrasound combined with solvothermal treatment to construct the layered nano-heterojunction. The layered BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction with intimate interfacial contact creates favorable conditions for the rapid transfer and separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and the capture of visible-light. The photocatalytic activities of the BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction for tetracycline (TC) removal and oxygen evolution under visible-light were investigated. Furthermore, the possible photocatalytic mechanism of the composite photocatalyst was discussed. This study proposes an effective idea for the rational fabrication of the layered BP/BiOBr composites for potential photocatalytic applications."

      "text" : "2.1. The structure and morphology of BP/BiOBr nanosheets\nIn order to improve the effective spatial separation of the photo-generated charge\nof the semiconductor and improve its quantum yield and photocatalytic activity, BiOBr and BP with a large difference in energy level were combined for the first time to obtain BiOBr/BP nano-heterojunction. The BiOBr/BP nano-heterojunction was prepared by facile two-step self-assembly process (Scheme 1). Firstly, BP/BiOBr composites were\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\nprepared by ultrasonically mixing separately prepared BiOBr and BP in NMP solvent, and then BP/BiOBr composites were subjected to the solvothermal reaction in methanol and vacuum dried to obtain Sol-BP/BiOBr composites. The obtained Sol-BP/BiOBr samples showed a homogeneous structure (as shown in Fig. 1b, c), and BP and BiOBr were combined by solvothermal effect, while the structure of the BP/BiOBr samples directly mixed by sonication was heterogeneous and loose (as shown in Fig. 1a). The fine structure of the crystal face and the phase interface of the Sol-BP/BiOBr nanoheterojunction can be observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). As shown in Fig. 1c, BP and BiOBr interface were in excellent contact. The lattice fringes with a crystal plane spacing of 0.52 nm were clear and regular, corresponding to the (002) crystal plane of BP. At the interface between BP and BiOBr, it was mainly the (002) and (004) planes of BP, which indicated that the nanoheterojunction would be formed between BP and BiOBr mainly by these planes. Both BP and BiOBr were superposed by two-dimensional nanosheets to form the heterostructure (Fig. 1d). Fig. 1e displayed the HRTEM image of layered Sol10BP/BiOBr. The EDS spectrum (Fig. 1f) from the rectangular frame area #1 in Fig. 1e revealed the characteristic peaks of Bi, O, Br and P elements. All the results proved the formation of Sol-10BP/BiOBr two-dimensional nanocomposites, resulted from the self-assembly of BiOBr nanosheets on BP nanosheets due to the effects of high temperature, high pressure and solvation of solvothermal treatment.\nScheme 1 Schematic illustration of the fabrication process of Sol-BP/BiOBr Jo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\nFig. 1 SEM images of BP/BiOBr (a) and Sol-BP/BiOBr (b), HRTEM image of SolBP/BiOBr (c), TEM image of Sol-BP/BiOBr (d), HRTEM image of Sol-BP/BiOBr (e) and EDS spectrum (f)\nThe phase structures of BP, BiOBr, 5BP/BiOBr, 10BP/BiOBr, 20BP/BiOBr and\nSol-10BP/BiOBr were analyzed by XRD (as shown in Fig. 2). Pure BP and BiOBr enjoyed the diffraction peaks similar to previous reported results [43, 47]. For BP/BiOBr especially Sol-10BP/BiOBr, the (002) and (004) peak intensities of BP in the composites were significantly reduced, indicating that the (002) and (004) crystal planes of BP were mainly formed into the nano-heterojunction with BiOBr. This result was consistent with the results observed in the previous HRTEM. Interestingly, we noticed a significant shift in the peak position of the Sol-10BP/BiOBr sample relative to the 10BP/BiOBr sample (Fig. 2b), indicating a strong interaction [56, 57] between the Sol-10BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction after solvothermal treatment. Jo ur\nna\nl P\nre\n-p\nro of\nFig. 2 XRD patterns of as-prepared samples (a), partial enlarged view at 30-35 ° of 10BP/BiOBr and Sol-10BP/BiOBr\nThe UV-Vis DRS of BP, BiOBr, 10BP/BiOBr and Sol-10BP/BiOBr was shown in\nFig. 3a. Compared with BiOBr, the absorption edge of 10BP/BiOBr and Sol10BP/BiOBr was red-shifted and the light-harvesting ability of visible-light was obviously enhanced. The red shift of the absorption edge and increasing of lightharvesting in visible light of Sol-10BP/BiOBr were more prominent than that of 10BP/BiOBr. The FTIR spectra of BP, BiOBr, 10BP/BiOBr and Sol-10BP/BiOBr were shown in Fig. 3b. As far as BiOBr, the peaks at 510 cm-1 and 879 cm-1 were related to the stretching vibration of Bi-O bond. The peaks at 1037 cm-1 and 1594 cm-1 were assigned to the stretching vibration of O-Br bond, the bending and stretching vibrations of O-H bonds caused by the surface adsorbed water, respectively. It was noteworthy that a new peak appeared at 2314 cm-1 in the FTIR spectra of Sol-10BP/BiOBr, which should be due to the formation of strong P-O-Bi bonds. It could be further confirmed by XPS and the results were shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen from the high-resolution spectra of P 2p of pure BP (Fig. 4a) and Sol-10BP/BiOBr (Fig. 4c), the characteristic peaks of P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2 appeared in the Sol-10BP/BiOBr composite were obviously shifted to lower energy levels (~0.15 eV) relative to pure BP. This indicated that there was a significant interaction between the two molecules after the combination of BP and BiOBr. Both P 2p and Bi 4f of Sol-10BP/BiOBr could be divided into four characteristic peaks (Fig. 4c, d). The characteristic peaks of P 2p spectrum should be arisen from the following functional groups: the electron orbit of P 2p (129.75 eV and 130.55 eV), O-P=O (133.4 eV) and P2O5 (134.3 eV). The existence of the O-P=O\nJo ur na l P re -p ro of\nfunctional group indicated that the formation of strong chemical bonds (P-O-Bi) between BP and BiOBr in the Sol-10BP/BiOBr composite. P-O-Bi peaks were also be found in Bi 4f peaks of the Sol-10BP/BiOBr composite (Fig. 4d), but no P-O-Bi peaks could be found in pure BiOBr (Fig. 4b), which could further confirm the formation of P-O-Bi chemical bonds in the Sol-10BP/BiOBr composite. The existence of the chemical bonds between BP and BiOBr was very conducive to the formation of the BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction with intimate interfacial contact.\n2.2. The enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity of BP/BiOBr nanosheets\nThe photocatalytic activity of as prepared samples was evaluated by degrading TC\nat room temperature. As shown in Fig. 5a, the removal rate of TC without catalyst was negligible. Irradiated for 90 min, the degradation rate of TC reached about 25% when pure BiOBr was added. This was mainly attributed to the strong internal electric field between the layers of BiOBr, which could effectively separate the electron-hole pairs and produce strong oxidizing free radicals [47, 49, 51]. After the combination of BP and BiOBr, the degradation rate of TC by the composite material was greatly increased compared with that by pure BiOBr, and the degradation rate first increased and then decreased with increasing BP content, reaching the maximum by 10BP/BiOBr after irradiation for 90 min. Note that, the degradation rate of TC by the Sol-10BP/BiOBr sample with solvothermal treatment was significantly higher than that of the physical mixed sample of 10BP/BiOBr, reaching the maximum value of approximately 85%. The kinetic process of photocatalytic TC degradation almost followed the pseudo-first order reaction kinetics (as shown in Fig. 5b). The apparent reaction rate constant (k) of Sol-10BP/BiOBr for TC photodegradation reached 0.021 min-1, which was 30.9, 7.8, 3.0, 1.9 and 2.3 times than that of BP, BiOBr, 5BP/BiOBr, 10BP/BiOBr and 20BP/BiOBr, respectively. For comparison, the degradation rates and k values for TC degradation by the as-prepared samples and other reported photocatalysts are listed in Table S1. In order to evaluate the stability of Sol-10BP/BiOBr photocatalyst, its cycling runs of the photocatalytic degradation for TC was performed (as shown in Fig. 5c). The degradation rate decreased slightly during the cycling process, but it was not obvious. After recycling for four times, the degradation rate still reached more than 80%.\nTo investigate the effect of the photocatalytic process on the complete degradation\nand mineralization of TC, the total content of organic carbon (TOC) measure of Sol10BP/BiOBr was performed and the results are demonstrated in Fig. 5d. The results showed that the rule of TOC mineralization rate of TC by Sol-10BP/BiOBr was the same as that of degradation rate. After light irradiation for 90 minutes, the TOC removal rate of TC could reach approximately 79%, indicating that the degradation of TC had achieved excellent mineralization effect.\nJo ur\nna l P\nep\nof\nphotocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under visible-light irradiation. It was clear that BiOBr, 10BP/BiOBr and Sol-10BP/BiOBr samples with better degradation activity also had significant photocatalytic oxygen evolution activity (Fig. 6a), but no oxygen was produced without photocatalyst or light irradiation. The pure BiOBr can produce oxygen in a relatively low oxygen-producing rate, while the pure BP had almost no oxygen production under visible-light irradiation. The 10BP/BiOBr sample exhibited higher oxygen-producing rate than the pure BiOBr, revealing that semiconductor composite was beneficial to the improvement of oxygen evolution reaction. In comparison, the oxygen evolution activity of Sol-10BP/BiOBr induced by solvothermal treatment was much higher than that of 10BP/BiOBr, and reached an O2 evolution rate of about 89.5 μmol g-1 h-1, which was 7.0 and 1.8 times than that of pure BiOBr and 10BP/BiOBr, respectively. For comparison, the photocatalytic oxygen evolution rates of the as-prepared samples and other reported photocatalysts are listed J ur na\n-p\nro\nof\nin Table S2. More importantly, the recycled Sol-10BP/BiOBr showed excellent photostability of the photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction after four cycle tests (Fig. 6b). In addition, it was worth noting that we had also found the Sol-10BP/BiOBr samples possessed outstanding photocatalytic activity for H2O2 production under visible-light irradiation (Fig. S1). These results also exhibited that the sample induced by solvothermal treatment formed a nano-heterojunction with a more tightly bonded interface, which facilitated the transfer and spatial separation of photogenerated carriers and retained higher oxidation and reduction activity.\nFig. 6 Oxygen evolution rate of BiOBr, 10BP/BiOBr and Sol-10BP/BiOBr under visible-light irradiation (a), O2 evolution cycling curves of Sol-10BP/BiOBr (b) 2.3. The separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers\nThe separation and transfer efficiencies of photogenerated carriers are important\nfactors in photocatalytic degradation and water splitting. The separation-recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs was characterized by photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 7a). Both BiOBr and 5BP/BiOBr exhibited a maximum emission peak near 330 nm. However, the PL intensity of 5BP/BiOBr was obviously weaker than that of pure BiOBr. Strikingly, when 10% of BP was coupled with BiOBr, especially the sample Sol-10BP/BiOBr formed by solvothermal hydroxyl groups action, the PL intensity was greatly reduced. These results indicated that solvothermal-induced hydroxyl reaction constructed a BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction with tightly interfacial bonding. At the same time, the internal electric field formed by the different Fermi levels of the two compounds effectively promoted the spatial separation of photogenerated carriers, thus reducing the recombination of photogenerated electronhole pairs. In addition, the separation and transfer efficiencies of photogenerated Jo ur\nna l P\nr -p\nro of\ncarriers were further characterized by transient photocurrent under visible-light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7b, the sample Sol-10BP/BiOBr treated by solvothermal in methanol environment displayed the highest transient photocurrent. The transient photocurrent of Sol-10BP/BiOBr treated by solvothermal in methanol was 40% higher than that of 10BP/BiOBr treated by ultrasound mixing, which was also much higher than that of pure BP and BiOBr. The above results demonstrated that the charge separation and transfer efficiency between the Sol-10BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction had been significantly enhanced.\n2.4. Possible photocatalytic mechanism\nThe energy band and electronic structure of the photocatalyst have a great\ninfluence on its photocatalytic performance. In order to understand the photocatalytic mechanism of Sol-10BP/BiOBr, it is first necessary to determine the band structure of Sol-10BP/BiOBr. The band potentials of Sol-10BP/BiOBr were measured by MottSchottky and valence band XPS (VB-XPS) plots. Fig. 8a and 8b showed that the flatband potentials of BiOBr and BP obtained from the Mott-Schottky plots were -0.41 and -1.22 eV versus Ag/AgCl, respectively. It was noteworthy that both BP and BiOBr nanosheets exhibited positive slopes, indicating that they possessed the characteristics of n-type semiconductors. The measured flat-band potentials (Ef, Ag/AgCl) under the condition of Ag/AgCl electrode at pH=7 can be converted to the normal hydrogen electrode potential by the following equation [58, 59]:\nEf, NHE = Ef, Ag/AgCl + EoAg/AgCl (1)\nWhere Ef, NHE was the flat-band potential of normal hydrogen electrode, EoAg/AgCl was\nJo ur\nna l P\nre\n0.197 eV. Therefore, the Ef, NHE of BiOBr and BP were calculated to be -0.21 and -1.02 eV. In general, the Ef, NHE of the n-type semiconductor was closer to the CB position, so that the CB potential of BP and BiOBr could be approximated to -1.02 eV and -0.21 eV (vs. NHE, pH=7), respectively. The VB value of the semiconductor can be measured by a small range scan of the VB-XPS plots. Fig. 8c and 8d displayed the VB-XPS spectra of BiOBr and BP where VB values of BiOBr and BP were determined to be 2.42 and 0.55 eV, respectively. The VB potential of normal hydrogen electrode (EVBNHE, vs. NHE, pH=7) could be calculated according to the contact potential difference between the samples and the XPS analyzer by the following formula [60, 61]:\nEVB-NHE =φ+ EVB-XPS-4.44 (2)\nWhere EVB-NHE was the VB potential (vs. NHE, pH=7), φ was the electron work function (4.55 eV) of the XPS analyzer, EVB-XPS was the VB value measured by VBXPS plots. Therefore, the EVB-NHE of BiOBr and BP was calculated to be 2.53 and 0.66 eV, respectively. According to the value from Mott-Schottky and XPS spectra analysis, the calculated bandgaps of BiOBr and BP were 2.74 and 1.68 eV, respectively. They agreed well with the bandgap values obtained from the UV-Vis DRS spectra (Fig. S2).\nTo further explore the interfacial charge transfer between BiOBr and BP, the work\nfunctions of BiOBr, BP and Sol-10BP/BiOBr were measured and calculated by the small range scan of the VB-XPS plots. When the solid sample was in good electrical contact with the metal sample holder of the XPS analyzer and the electron transfer was balanced, the Fermi levels of both reached the same level. However, the work function was different, and the kinetic energy of free electrons was changed by the contact potential difference ΔV=Φ-φ (φ was the work function of the XPS analyzer and the value was 4.55 eV, Φ was the work function of the sample), thereby changing the binding energy of the electrons [62, 63]. By measuring the change of the binding energy in a small range by XPS, ΔV could be gained from the spacing between the two inflection points (IP) of the curves (Fig. 8c-e), and then the Φ value of BiOBr, BP and Sol-10BP/BiOBr could be calculated to be 6.25, 5.65 and 5.95 eV, respectively. Therefore, on the basis of Mott-Schottky and VB XPS values revealed above, the band structures and the work functions of BiOBr and BP before and after contact were Jo ur al P\n-p ro\nf\ndisplayed in Fig. 8f. BP belonged to a reduction type photocatalyst with smaller work function (5.65 eV) and higher Fermi level. On the contrary, BiOBr belonged to an oxidation type photocatalyst with larger work function (6.25 eV) and lower Fermi level. Therefore, when BP and BiOBr were in close contact, the electrons on BP would spontaneously transfer to BiOBr until their Fermi levels were the same. At this time, due to the significant difference in positive and negative charge accumulation on both sides of the interface, an internal electric field from BP to BiOBr was formed at the interface. Once irradiated by light, the photogenerated electrons on the CB of BiOBr were very likely to transfer and recombine to the holes on the VB of BP due to the main induction of the internal electric field.\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\nFig. 8 Mott-Schottky curves of BiOBr (a) and BP (b), VB XPS curves of BiOBr (c), BP (d) and Sol-10BP/BiOBr (e), the work functions of BP and BiOBr before/after contact and the formation of internal electric field (f)\nAlthough the band structure of semiconductor photocatalysts and the initial\ntransfer of photogenerated charges between heterojunctions has been clarified, there is still a lack of other direct evidences for the free radicals produced during the photocatalytic process and the mechanisms of photocatalytic oxygen evolution, H2O2 production and degradation. The function of the active species and free radicals was determined by ESR and the results are shown in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9a and 9b, ·O2and ·OH signals were not observed in dark. After the visible-light irradiation, obvious ·O2- and ·OH free radical signals began to appear, indicating that ·O2- and ·OH were generated under the irradiation of visible-light with the present of Sol10BP/BiOBr. However, the signal intensity of ·O2- decreased significantly with the extension of irradiation time, which indicated that the produced ·O2- was then partially quenched by obvious other free radical reactions. Combined with the results of detected H2O2, we believe that some of the ·O2- are converted into H2O2 by the action of ·O2and H+. Under the same irradiation time, the signal intensity of ·OH did not change significantly. The signal intensity of h+ free radicals did not decrease but rise after irradiation (Fig. 9c), showing that the holes generated in the system reacted quickly to form ·OH. Jo ur na l P r -\nro\nof\nFig. 9 ESR detection under dark and visible-light irradiation: DMPO-·O2-(a), DMPO-·OH (b) and TEMPO-h+ (c)\nBased on the above mentioned results and discussion, a reasonable mechanism for\nthe enhanced photocatalytic activity was proposed, and schematically illustrated in Fig. 10. According to the band structure, the BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction seemed to be a typical Ⅱ-type heterojunction. However, if the photocatalytic charge transfer mechanism of Sol-10BP/BiOBr obeyed the Ⅱ-type heterojunction charge transfer mechanism, then the electrons that migrated to the CB of BiOBr and the holes that migrated to the VB of BP would not have sufficiently high reduction potential (only - 0.21 eV for CB of BiOBr) and oxidation potential (only 0.66 eV for VB of BP) to generate ·O2- (O2/·O2-, -0.33 eV) and ·OH (OH-/·OH, 2.29 eV), which was clearly contradictory to the experimental results above. Combined with the energy band structure, internal electric field and free radical testing results discussed above, the most reasonable photocatalytic charge transfer mechanism of this experimental system was the S-scheme photocatalytic mechanism [55, 64-68]. In particular, a novel S-scheme BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction was formed in this work due to the coupling of chemical bonds between the interfaces, the large contact area and the difference of Fermi level between the BiOBr and BP molecules. The relatively useless electrons (from CB of BiOBr) and holes (from VB of BP) recombined with each other due to the internal electric field and band edge bending interaction, while retaining the useful holes and electrons with higher redox potential on the VB of BiOBr and CB of BP. The holes on the VB of BiOBr could oxidize H2O to O2 and OH- to ·OH. The electrons on the CB of BP could reduce O2 to ·O2-, while some ·O2- would further react to produce O2 and H2O2. The generated ·OH and H2O2 became the main active species of mineralization and decomposition of TC.

      "text" : "In summary, a novel layered BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction photocatalyst with\nunique nanoscale heterostructure, band structures and chemically bonding interface was successfully fabricated by a facile liquid-phase ultrasound combined with solvothermal method. The unique Sol-10BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction yielded enhanced photocatalytic performance, including high apparent reaction rate constant for TC degradation (0.021 min-1), superior O2 evolution rate (89.5 μmol·g-1·h-1), and outstanding H2O2 production rate (1.62 μmol·L-1·min-1). The photocatalytic TC degradation, O2 evolution and H2O2 production rate of Sol-10BP/BiOBr was 7.8, 7.0 and 2.6 times than that of pure BiOBr, respectively. The significant enhancement in visible-light-driven photocatalytic performance and separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers could be attributed to the formation of S-scheme twodimensional nano-heterojunction with matched band structure, strong interfacial interaction, high redox and boosting spatial charge separation ability in BP/BiOBr composite photocatalyst.\nAcknowledgements\nJo ur\nal Pr\n-p\nro\nof\nThe authors acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China (Grant No. 51962023, 51772140), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province, China (Grant No. 20192ACBL21047, 20171ACB21033), the Scientific Research Foundation of Jiangxi Provincial Education Department, China (Grant no.

    "abstractText" : "J ur na l P re -p ro of Designing heterojunction photocatalysts with strong interfacial interaction and matched band structure is an effective way to reduce the recombination of photogenerated carriers. Herein, the exfoliated black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets were coupled with BiOBr nanosheets having higher Fermi level, and thereby it constructed a novel layered BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction with chemically bonding, larger contact interface and unique band structures. BiOBr nanosheets were self-assembled on the surface of BP nanosheets by a facile liquid-phase ultrasound combined with solvothermal method. The photocatalytic performance for tetracycline (TC) degradation, oxygen evolution and H2O2 production rate of Sol-10BP/BiOBr was 7.8, 7.0 and 2.6 times than that of pure BiOBr, respectively. The in-situ generated H2O2 and ·OH became the main active species of mineralization and decomposition of TC. The novel S-scheme two-dimensional BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction for boosting spatial charge separation retained the useful holes-electrons with higher redox ability, which was very beneficial for producing more ·OH, H2O2 and O2, and the photocatalytic activity was greatly improved.",
