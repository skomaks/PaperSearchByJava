      "text" : "Due to the wide range of beneficial physicochemical properties that can be achieved, as well as rapid and low-cost production, plastics are widely used in numerous consumer products including packaging materials in form of plastic bags and sheets and plastic bottles (Barnes et al. 2009; Bouwmeester, Hollman, and Peters 2015). In this context, the synthesis of plastics increased from 16.5 million tons in the fifties to 364 million tons at present, with a forecast of tripling this number by 2050 (Guglielmi 2017). These numbers have been accompanied by a corresponding rise in the plastic waste generated. Inevitably, the existing recycling processes cannot avoid millions of tons of plastic waste ending up in the environment in wastewater, dump sites and landfills. Once the plastics accumulate in different ecosystems, the environmental conditions favor physicochemical processes that lead to a continuous degradation, generating so-called microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs), based upon its “micro” (< 5,000 µm) or “nano” (< 100 nm)\nsizes (Bouwmeester, Hollman, and Peters 2015; EFSA, 2016) These particles, have raised special concern among the general population during the last decade since they are increasingly emerging and accumulating in all environmental compartments with insufficient relevant information regarding potential effects on humans. Thus, the interaction of MPs and NPs with both the ecosystems and human populations and consequent potential adverse effects on human health are not completely characterized.\nHumans may be exposed to MPs and NPs predominantly through two routes of entry, namely inhalation and ingestion. Dermal exposure may also occur; however few data are available. Inhalation of these particles might occur in outdoor and indoor environments as a result of microfiber release from synthetic textiles, among many other sources (Prata 2018). However, more attention was paid to oral ingestion of MPs and NPs since recent data revealed these compounds were present in abundant quantities in different food andbeverage sources, andwere detected\nCONTACT Ricard Marcos ricard.marcos@uab.cat; Alba Hernández alba.hernandez@uab.cat Group of Mutagenesis, Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Faculty of Biosciences, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Campus of Bellaterra, Cerdanyola del Vallès (Barcelona) 08193, Spain Color versions of one or more of the figures in the article can be found online at www.tandfonline.com/uteb.\n© 2019 Taylor & Francis\nin human stools (Liebmann et al. 2018). Although severe adverse effects have not apparently been found in the scarce existing studies, using in vitro or in vivomammalianmodels, there are reasons to prioritize research on the biological effects of these particles. First, differing from macroscale particles, the small size of MPs and NPs facilitate epithelial absorption and systemic biodistribution to organs following human exposure (Wright and Kelly 2017). Second, the biopersistence of these materials in biological environments on one hand, and the continuous human exposure, on the other, may lead to bioaccumulation of MPs and NPs in tissues and organs, leading to long-term effects, an urgent and important unexplored parameter to study. In addition, apart from their polymeric portion, MPs and NPs also present different types of well-known toxic additives, potentially producing adverse related effects (Revel, Châtel, and Mouneyrac 2018; Syberg et al. 2017). Finally, the high surface per volume, and hydrophobicity presented by these particles promotes the adsorption of other chemical compounds making them perfect carriers for persistent organic pollutants (POPs), antibacterial agents or heavy metals (Syberg et al. 2017; United Nations Environment Programme 2012).\nConsidering all the above factors, and to complement the information gathered in previous investigations, this review aimed to contribute to the field with more recent data available regarding the consequences of effects attributed to MPs and NPs exposures. In this review oral exposure was considered the main exposure route, and the reported data will focus in studies using in vivo and in vitro mammalianmodels. More importantly, experimental limitations representing realistic scenarios are identified and recommendations regarding in vitro and in vivo experiments are provided for future directed research."

      "text" : "Different synthetic polymers are used in the constitution of plastics, depending upon their intended use. Among these, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is employed in packaging materials, and by far is the major component of terrestrial plastic litter in form of plastic bags and sheets (Barnes et al. 2009). Highdensity polyethylene (HDPE) is utilized among\nother applications for corrosion-resistant piping, geomembranes, and plastic lumber, while polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is used overall in plastic bottles (Bouwmeester, Hollman, and Peters 2015). Altogether, polyethylene is the most produced polymer comprising more than 40% of the total plastics produced (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2012). Other polymers commonly employed include polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyactide (PLA) (Andrady and Neal 2009).\nOnce these polymers become plastic waste, many tones escape from the recycling chain and are incorporated into the environment, starting a long complex process of polymer degradation. This process is the first source of MPs and NPs that are generated. However, as technologies are producing nanoenabled products to improve industrial properties, plastics are also directly formed at the micro/ nanoscale. In this manner, MPs and NPs might also be released into the environment as “engineered produced” or “primary MPs/NPs” in paints, adhesives, and cosmetics, among many other products (Lehner et al. 2019).\nRegarding degradation, after chronic exposure mainly to UV light, physical abrasion and/or to environmental microorganisms, macropolymers are eventually degraded. The breakage of chemical bonds form smaller and smaller fragments comprised in the micro and nanoscale, the so-called “secondary MPs/NPs” (Andrady 2011; Cole et al. 2011; Lambert, Sinclair, and Boxall 2014; Thompson 2004). This fragmentation process produces a heterogeneous group of sizes, shapes, densities, and chemical compositions, among other characteristics, that make degraded plastics difficult to classify. Thus, MPs by definition encompass a wide size range below 5,000 µm. Variations in size may exert an important effect on the particlebiological systems interactions (Nel et al. 2006). Regarding shapes, weathered MPs and NPs might present all types of morphologies from fibers, spheres, cones, sticks or needlelike shapes to amorphous or irregular morphologies affecting their biological interactions. Similarly, crystallinity states differ among particles. This property directly affects density and permeability, determining its hydration and swelling behavior of the degraded plastics (Lambert, Scherer, and Wagner 2017). Despite the\nchallenge of characterizing these environmental complex mixtures of particles, researchers identified polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) in the first three positions of the ranking for MPs occurrence in marine ecosystems, reflecting their abundance in form of plastic waste (HidalgoRuz et al. 2012).\nThe global concern that has emerged around the potential adverse health effects of MPs and NPs, led to an increase in the number of scientific reports showing the presence of MPs in practically all environments and matrices, including marine and freshwater systems, outdoor and indoor atmospheres, soils and sediments (Dris et al. 2016; Li, Tse, and Fok 2016; Schneider et al. 1996; van Sebille et al. 2015). Although the analysis of different environmental samples is increasing rapidly, methodological standardizations are still lacking, hampering quantification and comparison analysis (Renner, Schmidt, and Schram 2018).\nIn addition to synthetic polymers, a variable percentage (up to 70%) of the total weight of plastics is formed by additives yielding specific physicochemical properties to the desired final product (Hansen et al. 2012). Among the diversity of the more than 10,000 additives, phthalates used as plasticizers are the most generally employed (Leslie et al. 2011), and their potential adverse health consequences were assessed, as recently reviewed (Ma et al. 2019; Radke et al. 2019). Nonetheless, a long list of many other additives are used including brominated flame retardants, bisphenol analogs, surfactants, lubricants, fragrances, pigments, and biocides, many of these chemicals are associated with potential toxic effects (Andrady and Neal 2009; Lambert, Sinclair, and Boxall 2014).\nMain exposure routes in humans\nHuman exposure to MPs and NPs is growing due to the degradation and fragmentation of millions of tons of plastics produced over the last 6 decades. The main portals of entry, by which these materials might exert a potential risk for the human population, are the pulmonary and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) barriers. Although dermal exposure seems to be less relevant, data indicate that nanoplastics might also transverse the dermal barrier (Revel, Châtel, and Mouneyrac 2018). Nevertheless, this route is usually\nassociated with exposure to plastic additives (bisphenol A, and phthalates, among others), as recently demonstrated (Bartsch et al. 2018; Lv et al. 2017).\nMPs and NPs might potentially become airborne from many different sources, such as detachment of fibers from synthetic textiles or from the action of the wind over the wastewater treatment sludge (Prata 2018; Revel, Châtel, and Mouneyrac 2018). From the total number of airborne particles potentially inhaled, only a fraction may reach the inner lungs. Thus, due to their hydrophobicity, inhaled MPs and NPs may be repelled by lung lining being eliminated via mucociliary clearance through the GIT. Therefore, despite emerging data regarding the increasing levels of airborne MPs, several investigators indicated that greater exposure to these particles occurs via the GIT (Galloway 2015; Lehner et al. 2019).\nIngestion of contaminated aquatic organisms was the first identified concern related to human exposure to MPs and NPs (Bouwmeester, Hollman, and Peters 2015; EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) 2016). At present, MPs were detected in hundreds of aquatic species, from zooplanktonic organisms at the base of the food chain, to higher trophic levels, in both invertebrate and vertebrate species (Cole et al. 2011; Leslie et al. 2011;Moore 2008; Thompson 2004; Waring, Harris, and Mitchell 2018; Wright, Thompson, and Galloway 2013). The presence of MPs in these organisms is known to arise directly from the ingestion of MPs, as well as by consumption of lower trophic contaminated organisms (Santana, Moreira, and Turra 2017; von Moos, Burkhardt-Holm, and Köhler 2012).\nRegarding human exposure to MPs and NPs via ingestion of marine organisms, some considerations need to be taken into account. Initially, it was considered that MPs were present only in the GIT and, in this case, the consumption of vertebrate marine organisms containing ingested MPs does not reflect a direct exposure since humans do not ingest the GIT of these species. Thus, direct exposure to humans might only occur whenMPs and NPs translocate through fish GIT or gills, and distribute to different organs and tissues through the circulatory system (Chae et al. 2018; Su et al. 2019). On the other hand, organisms entirely consumed including GIT such as mollusks, may simulate a greater ingestion of particles, representing the first source of dietary\nexposure toMPs andNPs arising from aquatic environments (Lehner et al. 2019).\nIn addition to aquatic organisms, recent studies identified alternative sources of MPs and NPs likely associated with higher levels of exposure (Catarino et al. 2018; Rist et al. 2018). MPs were found in several processed foods and drinks. Some of these identified edible products include sugar, honey, salt and canned sardines (Karami et al. 2017; Liebezeit and Liebezeit 2013; Yang et al. 2015), as well as beer and even tap and bottled water (Kosuth et al. 2017; Liebezeit and Liebezeit 2014; Schymanski et al. 2018). The number of studies analyzing the content of MPs in different edible products is growing quickly and its presence is likely. The reason is that ubiquitous environmental contamination, coming from surrounding plastic polymer release, ends up suspended in the air and eventually precipitating on different surfaces including edible products (Rist et al. 2018). In addition, plastic packaging release was also identified as a possible source of food and beverage contamination (Castle 2007; Cooper 2007; Cox et al. 2019; Toussaint et al. 2019).\nDespite the large number of variables and uncertainties identified, studies focused on estimating human exposure levels to MPs under different considerations. Specifically, considering atmosphericMPs fallout on edible products, a study demonstrated how MPs may end up on a dinner plate during a meal (Catarino et al. 2018). It was noted that an average of 7 particles per meal was found representing 70,000 particles ingested per year (Catarino et al. 2018). Cox et al. (2019) created a database of human exposure estimates based upon a thorough review of the literature of commonly contaminated consumed foods, in combination with the U.S. dietary data. In that study, the potential consumption ofMPs through inhalationwas also taken into consideration, as well as the American consumption of tap and bottled water. Thus, Cox et al. (2019) estimated an annual MPs consumption in the U.S. of 39,000–52,000 particles considering only food intake, increasing to 74,000–121,000 when inhalation was also taken into consideration. An addition of 90,000 MPs of ingestion was calculated when individuals meet their recommended water intake through only bottled sources, compared to the additional 4,000 MPs if alternatively tap water is consumed. As a conclusion, recent investigations and growing\nevidence indicate that human ingestion of MPs and NPs is originating from consumed contaminated organisms (mainly aquatic), atmospheric fallout during food and beverage production/consumption, and plastic packaging release, as detected in bottled water (Mason, Vg, and Neratko 2018; Rist et al. 2018; Schymanski et al. 2018)."

      "heading" : "Absorption",
      "text" : "Absorption of nutrients and chemicals is a process common to all mammalian species. Therefore, mice, rats, hamsters, and guinea pigs were historically used for absorption and toxicokinetic studies (OECD 2010). However, the vast combination of possible physicochemical properties seen in this heterogeneous mixture of MPs and NPs makes the use of in vivo mammalian models difficult to specifically assess absorption distinct from other parameters. In this context, in vitro models are commonly employed and recommended for practical, cost-effective and ethical reasons. Among the different cell lines available, as representative of the human small intestine, differentiated Caco-2 cells are the most widely used (Neutra and Louvard 1989; Zweibaum et al. 1991). These cells, representing enterocytes (the most abundant epithelial cell type in the intestine) growing on a semi-permeable membrane, may be utilized to assess the absorption of the compound from the apical to the basolateral chamber (Lefebvre et al. 2015). In addition, the establishment of co-cultures of Caco-2 along with HT-29 cells, as a cell model for mucus secretion, and with the lymphocytic Raji-B cells, as cells able to transform Caco-2 cells into the “M” cells characteristics of Payer’s patches, represents an in vitro physiological/\nstructural model of the intestinal barrier. The structure of this in vitro model is indicated in Figure 1. This model was successfully employed in many pharmacological and toxicological investigations, and commonly used for assessing the effective translocation of nanomaterials (García-Rodríguez et al. 2018; Vila et al. 2018). Thus, this model was proposed for the study of MPs and NPs absorption, including cell uptake and translocation through the intestinal barrier.\nFrom the existing mechanisms of particle uptake in the intestine, internalization via “M” cells and persorption were described as the most likely mechanisms responsible for MPs uptake, due to the extensive range of MP sizes that the intestine is able to absorb (Wright and Kelly 2017). “M” cells, forming 5 to 10% of cells in Peyer’s patches in humans, are able to take up large amounts of material up to 10 µm from the lumen by endocytosis, and transport this material to the “lamina propia” linked to lymph nodes and, eventually, to the blood system (Eldridge et al. 1989; Kucharzik et al. 2000). An alternative mechanism permitting the internalization of large particles through the small intestine is by persorption. By this mechanism, particles up to 150 µm cross the cellular barrier through gaps in the epithelium, known as desquamation zones (Steffens 1995).\nSeveral in vivo studies using different mammalian organisms were conducted to assess the permeability of the epithelial membrane to MPs. In general, utilizing latex microspheres and nanospheres low percentages of absorption of polymeric particles up to 150 µm were observed, confirming that the intestinal epithelium is an important and robust barrier against these types of materials (Jani et al. 1989, 1990; LeFevre, Boccio, and Joel 1989). Volkheimer (1975) noted the presence of PVC MPs (5–110 µm) in the lymphatic nodes, and in the portal veins, which were taken up through the epithelial barrier. Hussain, Jaitley, and Florence (2001) also detected various types of MPs (0.1–150 µm) in the lymphatic system of different species in rodents, dogs, rabbits and humans. More recent studies have also investigated this issue. Deng et al. (2017) observed a significant high translocation of spherical PS MPs (from 1 to 20 µm) through the epithelial barrier in mice. However, it should be mentioned that this study has been critically discussed regarding its plausibility (Böhmert, Stock, and Braeuning 2019; Braeuning 2019). Thus, applying toxicokinetic equations to the uptake data reported by Deng et al. (2017), and in comparison with the significantly lower uptake rates obtained in related studies (EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) 2016; Stock et al. 2019), the conclusions regarding uptake\nreported values appear unreliable and inconsistent (Böhmert, Stock, and Braeuning 2019).\nDespite the well-established in vitro absorption model previously mentioned, few studies can be found regarding the absorption of MPs and NPs. Using this approach Stock et al. (2019) found limited absorption of spherical PS MPs (1, 4 or 10 µm) using a Caco-2 co-culture model. The use of the monoculture model of Caco-2 cells was shown to be useful to demonstrate transcytosis mechanisms involved in the uptake of polystyrene NPs, as well as the role of lysosomes as a dead-end for NPs (Reinholz et al. 2018). An interesting approach employed laser ablation of large-size polymers to form PET NPs, to better mimicry real environmental nanopollutants (Magrì et al. 2018). Using this methodology authors obtained NPs of approximately 100 nm of average size, although with an important heterogeneity in size and shape. The obtained NPs were largely internalized in endolysosomes, showing intracellular biopersistence and long-term stability. Further, the obtained NPs exhibited enhanced ability to cross the simple model of intestinal barrier constituted by only differentiated Caco-2 cells (Magrì et al. 2018).\nIn the case of NPs, it is assumed that smallest size facilitates gut translocation and systemic distribution of particles. Higher rates of absorption were observed in the nanoscale range when compared to micro range sizes (Doyle-McCullough et al. 2007; Jani et al. 1989, 1990). Therefore, in addition to internalization through the abovementioned mechanisms, uptake through enterocyte barriers was noted for polymeric particles smaller than 100 nm (Jani, Florence, and McCarthy 1992). Considering the uptake of nanoparticles, information can be extracted from the fields of nanomedicine and nanotoxicology, where a wide variety of engineered nanoparticles were found to cross the epithelial barrier in both in vivo and in vitro models. Gathering information on the potential uptake of polymeric PS NPs, by using in vivo models, indicated large differences between studies reaching values as high as a 7% of bioavailability after treatments (Hillery and Florence 1996; Hillery, Jani, and Florence 1994; Jani et al. 1989). Regarding in vitro studies, variations in uptake were also detected ranging from\n0.2 to 10%, depending upon the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles used (Des Rieux et al. 2007; Kulkarni and Feng 2013; Walczak et al. 2015a, 2015b). In summary, the general agreement is that the intestinal epithelium constitutes an important barrier to MPs and NPs, and low rates of absorption were reported. However, smaller sizes seem to enhance the ability of the particle to translocate and to be biodistributed, entailing a real risk for the health of exposed humans (EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) 2016)."

      "heading" : "Biodistribution",
      "text" : "Following uptake, MPs and NPs may be distributed systemically to organs and tissues (Jani et al. 1989; Volkheimer 2001). Similarly, physicochemical properties play a key role in the kinetics and biodistribution of these particles. Size was shown to be an important modulating factor determining how deeply particles penetrate into the organs. Thus, small particles (<1.5 µm) were detected disseminated in different organs (EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) 2016). However, size is not the only factor modulating organ biodistribution since larger particles were also found accumulated in organs. In this context, despite criticism regarding the uptake data reported in the study of Deng et al. (2017), data demonstrated an accumulation of 5 μm and 20 μm PS MPs in different tissues using a mouse in vivo model. Specifically, using fluorescent PS MPs, Deng et al. (2017) observed that such particles accumulated in organs such as liver, gut, and kidney after 28 days of exposure. Interestingly, this distribution followed kinetics and accumulations dependent upon the particle size (Deng et al. 2017). However, controversy exists, since negative results were also reported in a similar study by Stock et al. (2019) who showed low in vivo uptake and no biodistribution in any organ after mice were exposed to 1, 4 or 10 μm spherical PS MPs for exposures lasting for 28 days. These contradictory results indicate a need for accurate methods to detect and quantify the presence of MPs and NPs in biological matrices. Although the detection and quantification of MPs seem to be established (Cole et al. 2014; Prata et al. 2019a)\nmost problematic is the identification of NPs (Correia and Loeschner 2018; Zhou et al. 2019)."

      "heading" : "Bioaccumulation",
      "text" : "Although there are many studies showing the internal accumulation of MPs and NPs, mainly in marine organisms (Ferreira et al. 2019), this approach is scarce in studies using mammalian models. In marine organisms, the internal accumulation seems to be species-specific and influenced by particle size. Thus, 10 μm spherical PS MPs accumulate in the circulatory system of mussels (Browne et al. 2008), while spherical PS MPs sized 5 μm are present in liver of zebrafish (Lu et al. 2016).\nAccumulation studies in mammals are lacking with the exception of the previously discussed study of Deng et al. (2017). In that investigation, bioaccumulation was reported in mice using fluorescent PS MPs sized 5 and 20 μm. Mice were exposed daily and accumulations of both sizes of MPs were detected in liver, kidneys, and gut. Interestingly, this study evaluated bioaccumulation over time. To this end, animals were sacrificed at 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, or 28 days after exposure and tissue samples from liver, kidneys, and gut obtained. Results clearly indicated that accumulation occurred over time, although the accuracy of the data has been questioned (Böhmert, Stock, and Braeuning 2019; Braeuning 2019). In Deng et al. (2017) study gut and kidney accumulated more 5 μm sizes, while liver accumulated more 20 μm sizes.\nThe removal of MPs from systemic fluids was reported through different routes. Splenic filtration, urine excretion, and bile excretion through feces were described (EFSA 2016; Volkheimer 2001). The presence of MPs in other fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid or milk, in animals and lactating women, were also detected (Volkheimer 1975; Wright and Kelly 2017). However, the small size characterizing these particles, as well as other physicochemical properties such as hydrophobicity, may hinder the mechanistical clearance leading to biopersistence. This fact was noted by Magrì et al. (2018) as demonstrated using a Caco-2 in vitro co-culture model of intestinal barrier showing a significant ability of PET NPs to cross the epithelial barrier, indicating stability and long-\nterm biopersistence. This property is considered a red flag in terms of potential adverse effects since it leads to accumulation and potentiation of long-term toxic effects."

In view of the purpose of this review, and in order to better extrapolate effects to humans, in this section only toxicity studies considering in vivo or in vitro mammalian models were considered.\nMPs and NPs are raising an increasing concern as potential toxicants, mainly due to three different factors. Thus, the intrinsic nature of polymers, the leaching of plastic additives, and the potential adhesion of contaminants have been highlighted as the predominant modulators for human adverse effects (Bouwmeester, Hollman, and Peters 2015). Extensive toxicity investigations were devoted to both plastic additives and adhered contaminants (EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) 2016; Magara et al. 2019; Meeker, Sathyanarayana, and Swan 2009; Talsness et al. 2009). Consequently, although considering the relevance of these factors inherent to the toxicity of any plastic waste, these elements are considered to be out of the scope of this review."

      "heading" : "Nature of MPs and NPs as toxicity modulators",
      "text" : "Regarding the intrinsic chemical composition of MPs and NPs, Lithner, Larsson, and Dave (2011) produced a comprehensive hazard ranking of plastic polymers, based upon internationally agreed criteria for identifying physical, environmental, and health risks factors. According to their classification as carcinogenic, mutagenic, or both, polyurethanes, polyvinylchloride, epoxy resins, and styrene-containing polymers such as PS, were placed in the highest positions of the ranking. On the other hand, PE, polyvinyl acetate (PVA), and PP were classified as potentially less hazardous (Lithner, Larsson, and Dave 2011).\nApart from the chemical nature, there are other factors inherent to the polymers which might also influence toxicity. First, going down in size facilitates intestinal absorption and systemic biodistribution, affecting the cellular fate of particles. Therefore, as noted in the previous section, the toxicity target of MPs and NPs depend in part upon their size. Thus, particles higher than 150 µm induce a local effect on the gut, whilst smaller particles (<150 µm) might produce toxicity in several secondary organs and tissues (EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) 2016).\nWright and Kelly (2017) proposed that during the polymerization process, and subsequent processing of plastics, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated, acting as a common factor initiating cellular damage. The concentration of these free radicals presented in the particles readily increase due to dissociation of the C − H bonds induced by light exposure or interaction with transition metals during the weathering process (Gewert, Plassmann, and MacLeod 2015; White and Turnbull 1994). In relation to that, it is worthwhile noting that environmental photodegradation and biodegradation produces surface changes affecting their functional groups (e.g., -COOH, -NH2), which alter the toxicological profiles (Andrady 2011). Other particle properties such as shape or surface charge, among others, were also identified as potential toxicity factors of MPs and NPs (Kim et al. 2016)."

      "text" : "Some in vitro studies examined the influence of MPs and NPs on cell viability, generally showing mild effects. Magrì et al. (2018) did not detect any cytotoxic effect of fluorescent PET NPs using Caco2 intestinal cells. Wu et al. (2019) using the Caco-2 cell line found that PS NPs (0.1 μm) and PS MPs (5 μm) produced little cytotoxicity, mild changes in membrane integrity, and negligible changes in its fluidity However, disruptions of the mitochondrial membrane potential were observed, as induced by both sizes of MPs. Interestingly, the effects produced by the larger size (5 μm) were greater than those induced by 0.1 μm sizes (Wu et al. 2019). In contrast, Stock et al. (2019) showed the cytotoxic\neffects of fluorescent spherical PS MPs (1, 4 or 10 μm) using Caco-2 cells and monocyte-like THP-1 cells. In that study, only 1 μm PS affected Caco-2 cells viability and only high concentrations above 50 µg/mL were used (Stock et al. 2019). This lack of adverse effects agrees with those results reported in both cerebral (T98G) and epithelial (HeLa) human cells (Schirinzi et al. 2017). In both cases, the use of PE MPs (3–16 µm) and PS MPs (10 µm) in a range of 0.05–10 µg/mL did not produce marked effects on cell viability (Schirinzi et al. 2017). This lack of adverse effects on Caco-2 cells was confirmed in an intestinal co-culture model (Caco-2/HT29-MTX-E12), where the use of 50 nm and 0.5 μm COOH-modified PS particles did not initiate toxic effects in the range of 0.01–- 100 μg/mL; however, some changes were detected in the metabolic activity at the highest doses (Hesler et al. 2019). Hesler et al. (2019) also used placental trophoblast cells (BeWo b30) and, in this case, adverse effects were observed with significant increases in metabolic activity at concentrations higher than 5 μg/mL (for 50 nm), associated with alterations in the mitochondrial activity only at concentrations from 0.01–10 μg/mL (for 0.5 µm).\nThese results differ from those reported in the human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells where the MTS assay exhibited a concentration-dependent significant decrease in cell viability after exposures to 60 nm of spherical PS NPs (Lim et al. 2019). The obtained results attained significance at concentrations up to 10 µg/mL. In addition, NPs exposure initiated autophagic- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related metabolic changes (Lim et al. 2019). The toxicity induced by MPs/ NPs might be modified according to surface area, as demonstrated using negatively charged carboxylated PS and positively charged amino-modified PS NPs. The positively charged NPs displayed higher cellular toxicity, disturbing the integrity of the cell membrane, on both normal (NIH 3T3) and cancer (HeLa) cells, although the effects were more pronounced in normal cells (Liu et al. 2011)."

If these reactive\nparticles are not sufficiently small to be absorbed through the epithelium, they might still exhibit the ability to induce local inflammation of the gut, which in turn might disrupt the membrane increasing the potential of particles to cross (Powell, Thoree, and Pele 2007). On the other side, if particles are sufficiently small to cross the intestinal epithelium, the ROS located on the surface of the particles might potentially enhance toxicity mediating the cellular stress responses in different intracellular targets.\nRegarding in vitro studies aimed to specifically assess the oxidative potential of MPs and NPs, derived from environmental exposures, only a few studies are found in the literature. Specifically, Schirinzi et al. (2017) showed no marked effects of spherical PE (0.1–16 μm) and PS (0.04–10 μm) MPs for disturbing homeostasis at the oxidative cellular level, using cerebral and epithelial cells. Wu et al. (2019) using the Caco-2 cell line, PS NPs (0.1 μm) and PSMPs (5 μm) produced mild molecular effects, including oxidative damage. Further, using human dermal fibroblasts and murine macrophages, it was found that amorphous PE MPs in the range of 20 μm, and at the high concentration of 1,000 μg/ mL, elevated ROS levels by approximately 30%. Nevertheless, larger sizes did not initiate any change in the basal levels of ROS (Hwang et al. 2019). With regard to in vivo studies, Deng et al. (2017) analyzed several biomarkers of toxicity. Among these, fluorescent spherical PS MPs of 5 μm and 20 μm, were linked with disturbances in the levels of oxidative stress, as evidenced by changes in the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) enzymes."

      "heading" : "Immune response",
      "text" : "The activation of the immune system by inflammatory responses was identified as one of the main effects associated with MPs and NPs exposures (Lehner et al. 2019; Prietl et al. 2014). As with the rest of the toxicity parameters, data relative to MPs and NPs effects on the immune system are limited. The number of immunological studies rises, if one considers other publications with different purposes such as the study of wear debris from plastic prosthetic implants, or those conducted with those PS nanoparticles used as a model in pharmacological studies (Chiu et al. 2015; Doorn, Campbell, and\nAmstutz 1996; Hicks et al. 1996; Lehner et al. 2019; Xia et al. 2008). The results reported in vivo with PE (0.5–50 µm) and PET (0.5–30 µm) prosthetic wear debris indicated immune phagocyte recruitment and associated production of cytokines, as an inflammatory response. The intensity of this reaction depended upon the chemical composition of the plastic, with PET being more harmful than PE (Wright and Kelly 2017). Among the in vitro studies carried out using PS NPs in pharmacological investigations, interleukin secretion, impaired expression of scavenger receptors (CD163 and CD200R), and even immune cell death was noted (Brown et al. 2001; Fuchs et al. 2016; Prietl et al. 2014). In a recent publication, Stock et al. (2019) demonstrated in vitro immune effects of fluorescent spherical PS MPs (1, 4 or 10 μm) using the human monocytic THP-1 cell line. In this case, exposures to MPL did not interfere with differentiation or activation processes of the human macrophage in vitro model. Similarly Stock et al. (2019) also reported absence of any sign of inflammatory responses when fluorescent spherical PS MPs were assessed after 28 days of mice feeding. Further, Hwang et al. (2019) found that high concentrations of amorphous PP MPs were necessary to stimulate the immune system enhancing the potential hypersensitivity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, murine macrophages (Raw 264.7), and in human dermal fibroblast (HMC-1) cells as evidenced by elevated levels of cytokines and histamines. In addition, enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNFα, and histamine was also detected. Interestingly, these effects were sizedependent in a concentration-dependent manner, with increased induction at the highest tested concentrations using particles sized approximately 20 µm (Hwang et al. 2019)."

      "heading" : "Genotoxicity",
      "text" : "An important and potential toxic effect linked to MPs and NPs exposure is DNA damage. There are different mechanisms by which these particles induce genotoxicity. The DNA surrounded by the nuclear membrane may be damaged i) directly through particle contact (only when particles are sufficiently small to cross the nuclear membrane), ii) indirectly, by generation of cytoplasmic ROS reaching the nucleus or iii) by impairment of the\nreplication and/or the repair machinery due to MPs/NPs exposure (Fadeel, Pietroiusti, and Shvedova 2012). The unrepaired or misrepaired DNA lesions lead to mutagenic processes. If these mutations modulate key genes involved in genomic integrity maintenance, or cell cycle control, then carcinogenesis might be initiated. Therefore, it should be considered that if MPs and NPs are able to induce genotoxicity, then these plastics might also have the capacity to initiate carcinogenesis due to alterations imposed on the genetic material (Fadeel, Pietroiusti, and Shvedova 2012). Surprisingly, only few studies using MPs/NPs in mammalian cells were found that assessed DNA damage induction. The genotoxicity of fluorescent 50 nm PS nanoparticles, with different functionalized surfaces (non-functionalized, carboxylated and aminated) was assessed using the γ-H2Ax foci assay. This assay permits detection of DNA double-strand breaks. Paget et al. (2015) performed this study using pulmonary epithelial cells (Calu-3), and human macrophages (THP-1). The obtained results indicated that only aminated NPs were significantly increasing the levels of DNA damage. Thus, for similar NPs concentrations and sizes, aminated PS nanobeads were more genotoxic than unmodified and carboxylated ones, as demonstrated in both cell lines (Paget et al. 2015). In another study, PoPoma et al. (2019) analyzed the genotoxic effect of spherical PS NPs (100 nm) in the foreskin Hs27 cell line. In this case, the micronucleus assay was performed to detect induction of chromosome breakage and/or alterations in the chromosome segregation machinery. The results showed induction of DNA damage resulting in significant elevation in the frequency of micronuclei. This induction exhibited a concentration-dependent relationship with significant effects after exposure to 25 µg/mL and 75 µg/mL (PoPoma et al. 2019). In addition, the potential genotoxicity of two sized (50 nm and 0.5 µm) COOH-modified PS NPs were examined using two different assays, the p53 reporter gene assay and the micronucleus assay (Hesler et al. 2019). In the first assay changes in the expression of p53 protein were detected using the HepG2CDKN1A-DsRed biosensor cell line. In the second assay, the number of micronuclei was assessed in CHO-K1 cells. Despite the capability of\ninternalization, no genotoxic effects were detected in either of the assays used. These results are in agreement with those previously reported by Liu et al. (2011) using negatively charged carboxylated PS, and positively charged amino-modified PS NPs and MPs (NH2ePS) of three different diameters (50, 100 and 500 nm), on cancer HeLa cells and in normal NIH 3T3 cells. Although important internalization was observed, the NPs and MPs used were not found to be associated with any of the components of the mitotic apparatus. In addition, no marked alterations in the normal cell division process were detected. However, extension in the G0/G1 phase of the cells cycle, with a decreased expression of cyclin D and cyclin E levels was observed after H2ePS exposure (Liu et al. 2011). It should be noted that these changes are usually associated with DNA damage and the activation of checkpoint controls."

      "heading" : "Limitations and future perspectives",
      "text" : "The presence of MPs and NPs is progressively increasing in all environments, being introduced and accumulating in the food web. However, some gaps need to be filled to draw any worthwhile conclusions regarding potential adverse health effects and, subsequently, the preparation and implementation of a reliable risk assessment. Among the limitations of the existing data, the incomparable human exposure levels detected in the different reported studies entails an important constraint. While MPs were found in a variety of edible products, quantification is not readily comparable. Apart from the heterogeneity of the samples, varying detection technologies using different units, detection principles, and detection thresholds make comparisons difficult to establish, and impracticable in many cases (Rainieri and Barranco 2019; Renner, Schmidt, and Schram 2018). Based on these factors, for the sake of making studies biologically relevant and comparable, standardization processes are urgently required in this field (Syberg et al. 2015). Regarding NPs, no apparent data are available reporting environmental qualitative and quantitative measurements. Currently, existing technologies are not sufficiently developed to sample, detect, and quantify environmental plastics in the\nnano-range. Therefore, although continuous plastic degradation from MPs to NPs is expected (as shown by Lambert, Sinclair, and Boxall 2014 in controlled situations), real exposure scenarios are predictive and inaccurate. Efforts in this field are urgently required to achieve accurate exposure data by developing new methods.\nHuman biomonitoring studies are a fundamental requirement to perform a reliable occupational and environmental health risk assessment of MPs and NPs; however, these studies are non-existent. These studies permit one to quantify the number of chemical compounds absorbed, transformed or accumulated in target organs, tissues or cells, as a consequence of occupational or environmental exposures (Fadeel, Pietroiusti, and Shvedova 2012). These studies would allow for the identification of potential hazards and the understanding of biological mechanisms of new and emerging contaminants. For such purposes, different biomarkers are used as surrogates of designated biological events. Thus, by measuring these biomarkers, information regarding interactions between the xenobiotic and the individual is obtained (see Figure 2). Although the implementation of biomonitoring studies regarding MPs and NPs exposures are needed (Prata et al. 2019b), some issues need to be addressed for applicability. First, there is still a lack of information regarding appropriate and reliable biomarkers of exposure which interfere with detection and tracking of the\nparticles over time in biological matrices such as blood or urine. Similarly, more research is needed for identification of suitable biomarkers of effect that reflect early biological events preceding functional damage. Development of susceptibility biomarkers is also required enabling the identification of groups at higher risk of suffering adverse effects. With regard to the development of all biomarkers, it is crucial for the establishment of reference values and limits for the measurements obtained, enabling the interpretation of the results. Biomonitoring studies ofMPs and NPs are currently not available and thus this point has been identified as a priority for the research community.\nIn order to find biomarkers related to potential adverse health effects, more information regarding in vivo and in vitro toxicity attributed to ingested MPs and NPs is required. Until now, few studies investigated this issue focusing predominantly on only one specific polymer and one specific shape, as it is the case for spherical PS (Mahler et al. 2012; Prata et al. 2019b; Walczak et al. 2015a, 2015b). As previously indicated, MPs and NPs encompass a large of heterogenic group of particles with different physicochemical properties such as size, shape or chemical structure. Thus, the results obtained thus far with spherical PS represent only a small percentage of the environmental picture. In this context, scientists are encouraged to perform more experiments to cover these gaps\nwhich might ultimately help to develop biomarkers for human biomonitoring studies and perform an environmental health risk assessment (Figure 2).\nAnother consideration of interest when examining potential adverse health effects attributed to MPs and NPs is the altered condition of the gut mucosa. Intestinal related diseases might be a modulating factor of internalization and related effects. Thus, patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease already showed greater uptake of particles compared to healthy controls, which might also lead to differing adverse situations (Schmidt et al. 2013). This is an important parameter to consider in future investigations since alterations in gut physiology are increasing in developed societies due to inadequate nutritional and lifestyle habits (M’Koma 2013). Related to this point the potential adverse effects of MPs/NPs on the gut microbiome and their consequent effects on human health should be noted. A recent study feeding of mice with PS MPs for 5 weeks demonstrated that oral exposure to 1,000 μg/L of 0.5 or 50 μm PS MPs decreased body and liver weights (Lu et al. 2018). In addition, mucus secretion in the gut was significantly decreased and gut microbiota was affected, reducing relative abundances of Firmicutes and αProteobacteria filum in the feces (Lu et al. 2018). These results are in agreement with those recently reported in male mice exposed to 5 μm of pristine and fluorescent PS MPs for 6 weeks (Jin et al. 2019). Jin et al. (2019) reported a reduction in the intestinal mucous secretion, and damage in the intestinal barrier function. In addition, the diversity of the gut microbiota was significantly altered, and the content ofActinobacteria significantly lowered at the phylum level. Although the health consequences of MPs ingestion in humans remain to be determined, the above animal studies showing gut inflammation, oxidative stress, and alterations in the gut microbiome may be an alarm signal to further explore this type of research. Due to the relationship between microbiota dysbiosis and human health, Moulin and van Egmond (2019) proposed an attractive hypothesis linking MPs/NPs exposure, gut microbiota alterations and mental disorders. Moulin and van Egmond (2019) suggested to considerer behavioral and cognitive alterations associated with exposure to MPs/NPs in future investigations.\nLong-term health effects of chronic exposure to MPs and NPs are relevant parameters, but insufficiently explored until now. Among these studies, Amereh et al. (2019) determined the potential impact of chronic exposure to spherical PS NPs (<100 nm) on thyroid endocrine status and biochemical stress using a rat model. PS NPs (up to 10 mg/kg/day) were administered through oral gavage for 5 weeks. After 5 weeks evidence of an association between exposure to PS NPs and thyroid endocrine disruption, as well as metabolic deficit, was detected (Amereh et al. 2019). These types of studies are crucial because once particles enter into tissues and organs, physicochemical properties make them prone to accumulate. This particle bioaccumulation extended over time, might affect the normal cell functionality leading to molecular adverse effects such as mutagenesis and carcinogenesis (Wright and Kelly 2017). As previously mentioned, the extensive combination of different physicochemical properties seen in MPs and NPs makes impractical the use of in vivo mammalian models to assess long-term effects. Therefore, in this scenario, alternative methods based upon 3-R (replacement, reduction, and refinement) recommend the use of in vitro systems (Hartung and Sabbioni 2011). Specifically, environmental low-dose cellular treatments for long exposure periods, enables examination of cellular transformation processes through different wellestablished end-points (see Figure 3). In turn, these investigations provide important information related to tumorigenesis, transferable to in vivo mechanisms. As seen in nanotoxicological studies, chronic exposures to relevant environmental (lowdose) concentrations may induce cellular carcinogenic mechanisms. This was observed in the case of different cell types such as epithelial or fibroblastic cells exposed to different nanoparticles (Annangi et al. 2015; Rubio et al. 2017; Vales, Rubio, and Marcos 2016). Research regarding long-term and accumulative effects of these type of particles is urgently required, thus in vitro studies possess several advantages justifying its implementation.\nIn summary, although technology is not sufficiently developed to adequately calculate human exposure levels, the degradation of the plastic waste already accumulated everywhere in the planet, indicates a continuous and growing human exposure to MPs and NPs. Oral ingestion is the\nprimary route of exposure, constituting the intestinal barrier a robust impediment for particle translocation. However, more information regarding the effectiveness of the intestinal barrier on the translocation of different physicochemical attributes of particles and shapes is needed. Until now, only a few studies were designed to assess the adverse health effects of environmental exposures to specific MPs and NPs. Among these few studies, mild harmful effects have generally been linked to these particles. However, there is still an urgent need for experimental data to investigate and better represent different biological parameters, such as the potential cellular mechanisms of different physicochemical attributes of particles, effects on altered conditions of the gut mucosa, or longterm effects."
