This field, named plasmonic catalysis, has emerged as a new frontier in nanocatalysis. For metals such as silver (Ag), gold (Au), and copper (Cu), the LSPR excitation can take place in the visible and near-infrared ranges, opening possibilities for the conversion of solar to chemical energy and new/alternative reaction pathways not accessible via conventional, thermally activated catalytic processes.

The LSPR excitation refers to localized collective oscillation of conduction electrons in a metal nanoparticle induced by the oscillating electric field component of an incoming electromagnetic wave (Figure 1a) [1,7e9]. This condition is established when the frequency of the incident electromagnetic wave matches that of the electrons oscillating against the fixed lattice represented by the positive nuclei [1,10]. For instance, for metals such as Ag, Au, and Cu, the LSPR excitation can take place in the visible and near-infrared ranges, opening up possibilities for the utilization of solar energy to excite their LSPR [2,6,10]. Owing to the LSPR excitation, plasmonic nanomaterials are empowered with a remarkable ability to confine and manipulate light at the nanoscale and overcome some of the intrinsic limitations of light harvesting in semiconductors [2,7,11,12].\nThe LSPR excitation has propelled the use of plasmonic nanomaterials in a variety of applications, including sensing [13], the development of light-emitting materials and devices [14,15], biomedicine [5], and energy [15,16]. Interestingly, it has been recently established that the LSPR excitation can also be put toward the enhancement of the rates and the control of several chemical transformations. This field, coined plasmonic catalysis, has emerged as a novel frontier in nanocatalysis. It enables, at least in principle, to combine optical and catalytic properties at the nanoscale as well\nwww.sciencedirect.com\nas to use of visible or near-infrared light as a sustainable and abundant energy input to drive and control molecular transformations [7,10,17,18].\nHere, we provide an overview of the current understanding of plasmonic catalysis enabled by the use of designed-controlled nanostructures based on plasmonic and catalytic metals as model systems. After introducing the fundamentals of plasmonic catalysis, we discuss trends in plasmonic catalytic performances and their correlation with nanoparticle size, shape, composition, and structure. Then, we highlight how multimetallic compositions and morphologies containing both catalytic and plasmonic components enable one to extend the use of plasmonic catalysis to metals that are important in catalysis but do not support LSPR excitation in the visible range. Finally, we highlight some of the outlook, challenges, and future directions of the field.\nFundamentals of plasmonic catalysis Regarded as a promising alternative to traditional thermochemically driven catalysis, plasmonic catalysis relies on exploiting the energy stored by the LSPR excitation that can be dissipated nonradioactively through the creation of energetic charge carriers: hot electronehole pairs as described in Figure 1b and c [2,7,17]. These initially formed high-energy charge carriers can, in turn, participate to enhance the rates or to mediate molecular\nwww.sciencedirect.com\ntransformations [3,10,17]. For instance, this can occur via electronic or vibrational excitation of adsorbed molecules at the plasmonic metal/molecule interface under light irradiation. This process, when involving hot electrons, can allow for the generation of transient negative-ion states of adsorbed molecules that can then undergo subsequent chemical transformations or decay to vibrationally excited levels at the ground state [3,10,17]. In this context, by populating antibonding molecular orbitals in adsorbed molecules, desorption, dissociation, and translation processes in adsorbates can be induced [10,17]. In addition to hot electrons, hot holes can also participate in charge transfer processes at the metalemolecule interface, enabling oxidation processes [2].\nInterestingly, the LSPR-generated hot charge carriers can contribute not only to enhanced reaction rates but also control over reaction selectivity. For example, the formation of reaction intermediates can be tuned and novel reaction pathways can be observed relative to the thermally activated transformation counterparts [17,19,20]. It is important to note that, in addition to the generation of charge carriers, localized heating as a result of thermal dissipation after LSPR relaxation can also contribute to increased reaction rates under LSPR excitation (Figure 1d) [1e3,10,21e24]. Even though acceleration on the rates of some transformations in plasmonic catalysts has been assigned to this effect, it\nCurrent Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 2019, 39:110–122\nremains challenging to decouple it from the role played by charge carriers [17,25e28].\nIt is recognized that the LSPR excitation and the subsequent generation of LSPR-excited charge carriers play a central role in plasmonic catalysis. Therefore, the control over the optical properties in plasmonic nanoparticles supporting LSPR excitation in the visible and near-infrared regions becomes of paramount importance [2,3,29]. In this context, it is well established that the maneuvering over the shape, composition, size, and structure (solid vs. hollow interiors) can be effectively employed to (i) tune LSPR frequencies (that dictate the wavelengths in which light excitation can lead to higher plasmonic catalytic activities); (ii) maximize the magnitude of electric field enhancements at the surface (that can decay by radiative scattering of photons or nonradiatively generating hot charge carriers); and (iii) optimize the absorption vs. scattering efficiencies (which influences light absorption and thus the generation of hot carriers that can contribute toward plasmonic catalytic transformations) [2,3,10,17]. The control over composition can also be used to develop multimetallic materials consisting of both plasmonic and catalytic metals (that do not support LSPR excitation in the visible or near-infrared ranges) [17,29]. In this way, one can use the plasmonic component to harvest light and generate the LSPR-excited charge carriers that can flow toward the nonplasmonic but catalytic sites, offering control over chemical reactions beyond those for which Ag and Au are catalytically active [17,29,30].\nAs can be envisaged from the aforementioned discussion, controlling size, shape, composition, and structure of plasmonic nanomaterials can play a central role for the optimization of the LSPR attributes that are important in plasmonic catalysis. Thus, it enables the optimization of performances and a better understanding of enhancement mechanisms and reaction pathways under light illumination. This may have an important impact on transferring this insight to real-world plasmonic catalysts and industrial reactors [2,18,30]. Motivated by this scenario, researchers have developed protocols for the controlled synthesis of a variety of plasmonic nanostructured materials [18,29e31]. In fact, we have lately witnessed a dramatic growth in both the number and scope of improved chemical protocols aimed at producing these nanostructured materials with welldefined sizes, shapes, and compositions [2,32,33]. This has proved to be a great help to improve our understanding of plasmonic catalysis and plasmonics [2,17,34].\nPlasmonic nanostructures with controlled shapes, sizes, and structures In this section, we will discuss key examples to illustrate how the control over nanoparticle size, shape, and\nCurrent Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 2019, 39:110–122\nstructure enables the tuning of optical properties and the establishment of important structureeperformance relationships in plasmonic catalysis. Regarding the investigation on the effect of metal loading and size in plasmonic catalysts based on Au nanoparticles, Mukherjee et al. [27] demonstrated the first experimental evidences for the room temperature photocatalytic dissociation of H2 on spherical Au nanoparticles supported on TiO2. The Au/TiO2 samples were prepared by depositioneprecipitation method using NaOH to adjust the pH. This synthetic approach allowed the authors to correlate the photocatalytic rate with increasing Au loading in the samples because five different Au/TiO2 samples with Au nanoparticles w7 nm in size were prepared with increasing amounts of Au (loadings corresponded to 0.57, 1.00, 1.75, 2.25, and 3.23 wt %). The results revealed a strong dependence of the catalytic rate on Au loading, in which an increase of photocatalytic rate with the increase in Au concentration was detected. By using the same synthetic approach, the rate dependence on Au nanoparticle size was studied using a fixed metal loading (1 wt%). The photocatalytic rate for 16 nm Au nanoparticles was only half that of 8.6 nm. Noticeably, the photocatalytic rate was negligible for Au nanoparticles larger than 21 nm. This decrease in dissociation rate with increase in size was explained based on the decrease in the Au surface area. An important point that was addressed in this work was that the mechanism of hot electroneinduced dissociation of H2 on the Au surface was studied by theoretical calculations. The results indicated that the hot electrons have enough energy to inject into the antibonding state of the H2 molecule, creating a transient negative ion H2\nd complex. This complex can then move along its potential energy surface, facilitating the H2 dissociation process [27]. Interestingly, it was also demonstrated that the lifetimes of the initially generated hot electrons can be much longer (100e500 fs) on small relative to larger nanoparticles because of increased confinement and reduced electroneelectron interactions [27].\nMore recently, Qian et al. [35] proposed, for a similar photocatalytic system (Au/TiO2), a plasmon-induced interfacial chargeetransfer transition in which the semiconductor is used to collect the hot carriers generated from the LSPR excitation in Au nanoparticles [35]. The Au/TiO2 photocatalysts were fabricated using depositioneprecipitation and photodeposition methods onto P25 (Degussa) TiO2. The authors correlated the Au nanoparticle size with the interfacial hot electron transfer efficiency for the photocatalytic reduction of H2O. They postulated that both small (4.4 nm) and large (67 nm) nanoparticles can support hot electron transfer to the conduction band of TiO2. However, for smaller nanoparticles, the weaker LSPR intensity leads to a low electron transfer efficiency. Meanwhile, the 67 nm Au nanoparticles produce a more intense LSPR\nwww.sciencedirect.com\nthat greatly facilitates the injection of electrons to the TiO2 conduction band, triggering their accumulation resulting in a different energy level occupancy [35]. In this way, this electron accumulation allows to the manipulation of their reduction potential by simply varying the nanoparticle size, allowing for the control over the photocatalytic activity of Au/TiO2 mediated by the LSPR excitation. These results not only highlight the importance of the interface in the efficiency of these processes but also reveal new perspectives about the microscopic mechanism of LSPR-mediated charge transfer processes.\nInvestigations on structureeperformance relationships have also been performed for other plasmonic metals, such as Ag. Our group recently studied the sizedependent LSPR-mediated activities of Ag nanoparticles [36]. We synthesized Ag nanoparticles having controlled sizes by a chemical etching approach using HNO3. In this work, we were able to obtain sizes from 12 to 50 nm in diameter and used LSPR-mediated oxidation of p-aminothiophenol (PATP) to p,p’-dimercaptoazobenzene (DMAB) as a model transformation. In this work, we were able to correlate electromagnetic field enhancements, the scattering/absorption crosssections ratios as a function of Ag nanoparticle size, and the LSPR-mediated oxidation conversions [36]. It was revealed that the LSPR-mediated activities displayed a volcano-type variation with size. The observed size-dependent LSPR mediated activities could be related to a compromise between near-field enhancements and the absorption/scattering ratio as a function of size. It was found that the nonradiative decay process (absorption) of LSPR excitation represented the dominant contribution over the detected LSPR-mediated conversions, which increased until the NPs size reached 30 nm. Then, at larger sizes, radiative decay (scattering) became more dominant, which led to a reduction in the relative formation of DMAB [36].\nIn addition to the effect of size, Ag nanomaterials having different shapes were used as model systems to investigate the effect of the nature of exposed surface facets over the LSPR-mediated oxidation of PATP to DMAB. In this case, Ag nanospheres, nanocubes, wires, and triangular prisms were prepared as illustrated in Figure 2aeh [37]. As shown in Figure 2j, the DMAB conversion under 632.8 nm excitation displayed a shapedependent behavior, which followed the order: triangular prisms and quasi-spheres > wires[ cubes. It was postulated that a higher ratio of Ag {111} surface facets present on triangular prisms and nanospheres compared with the other shapes was responsible for the high activity of these materials. In the LSPR-mediated oxidation of PATP, the activation of O2 by LSPR-excited hot electrons represents a key step [34]. In the Ag {111} surface facets, it has been demonstrated that the interaction with O2 is weaker relative to {100} facets\nwww.sciencedirect.com\n[37]. This can enhance the O2 cleavage upon activation by hot electrons from LSPR-excited Ag nanocrystals, contributing to improved PATP conversions. These results reveal that shape plays an important role in the optimization of activity in LSPR-mediated transformations and could potentially assist the design of new plasmonic catalysts with target activities.\nRegarding the use of shape-controlled Ag nanomaterials in plasmonic catalysis, a seminal article using Ag nanocubes was reported by Christopher et al. [34] In this report, the nanocubes were 60 nm in edge length and were synthesized through a polyol process. They were supported on Al2O3 and evaluated for the ethylene epoxidation, CO oxidation, and NH3 oxidation reactions using atmospheric pressure and visible-light illumination. The results revealed that upon illumination, the steady-state ethylene epoxidation reaction rate increased about four times as compared to the thermal process (without light). This visible light-induced rate enhancement was similar to those measured for CO oxidation and NH3 oxidation. The proposed O2 activation mechanism governing the observed light-induced rate enhancement was similar to the reported for H2 dissociation [27,34,38]. Theoretical calculations supported that the energy required to populate O2 antibonding orbitals matches the energy of energetic electrons formed in the process of LSPR excitation on Ag. The LSPR-excited hot electrons can deposit energy into the OeO vibrational mode resulting in an O2 adsorbate with a lower dissociation activation energy that can trigger oxidation at lower temperature compared with that of the thermal (light off) processes [34]. This is because the transfer of hot charge to O2 induces the molecule to evolve along an excited potential energy surface. As the electron decays back to the metal, the O2 returns into a vibrationally excited state on the ground-state potential energy, enabling the activation of the O2 adsorbate at lower temperatures relative to the thermally driven process with no LSPR excitation [17,34].\nTo expand the scope of catalytic transformations that can be promoted by the use of Ag nanocubes as plasmonic catalysts, Landry et al. [39] demonstrated the use of Ag nanocubes as catalysts for the activation of H2 and the hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes via visible light irradiation at 405 nm. A large variety of substrates could be hydrogenated by this procedure, demonstrating the versatility of this method. An increase of 45% of yield was observed using 405 nm laser relative to the wide spectrum light bulb of similar intensity, while a linear relationship of yield as a function of intensity was reported. The mechanism for activation under plasmonic excitation was similar to what was reported by Halas for the H2 activation using Au nanoparticles [27].\nCurrent Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 2019, 39:110–122\nIn addition to the control over size and shape, the structure in plasmonic nanoparticles can also be optimized to improve performances in plasmonic catalysis. This concept was recently illustrated by the use of plasmonic nanorattles composed of an Au nanosphere inside an AgAu nanoshell as catalysts toward SPRmediated oxidation reactions promoted by activated O2. A seeded growth approach followed by a galvanic replacement reaction was used to synthetize Au@AgAu nanorattles. Owing to the plasmon hybridization between the nanosphere and nanoshell components, much higher plasmonic catalytic activities were observed for the nanorattles relative to the nanoshell and nanosphere counterparts toward the LSPR-mediated oxidation of PATP to DMAB [40]. Moreover, the nanorattles could be used as plasmonic catalysts for the\nCurrent Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 2019, 39:110–122\nliquid phase aniline oxidation using ambient conditions and visible light as the only energy input. The aniline conversion over the Au@AgAu nanorattles was significantly higher (>90%) when compared with the nanoshells and nanospheres [40].\nThe results discussed in this section clearly demonstrate the synthesis of plasmonic nanoparticles displaying control over size, shape, and structure can play a central role toward not only the optimization of performances but also shedding new light into the understanding of how several physical and chemical parameters dictate performances in plasmonic catalysis. In this case, the key parameters that are desirable for an optimized plasmonic catalysts can be identified as follows: (i) sizes that maximize absorption efficiencies\nwww.sciencedirect.com\nrelative to scattering; (ii) exposure of surface facets that enable the suitable balance in absorption/desorption energies of substrate species; and (iii) and structures and morphologies that enable one to maximize electric field enhancements under LSPR excitation.\nMarrying plasmonic and catalytic components in multimetallic nanoparticles Although the studies mentioned in the previous section demonstrate the use of plasmonic metal nanoparticles as catalysts under visible light illumination, the catalytic properties of these systems are limited in terms of the scope of molecular transformations catalyzed by Ag and Au. On the other hand, several metals that are important for nanocatalysis do not display LSPR excitation in the visible or near-infrared ranges [41,42]. In this context, multimetallic nanoparticles containing a plasmonic and a catalytic component represents a remarkable strategy to marry plasmonic and catalytic properties. In this section, we turn our attention to how the nanometric integration of plasmonic and catalytically active\ncomponents could enable the use of the plasmonic metal to harvest energy from light to accelerate and control transformations at the surface of the catalytic metal.\nRecent design strategies proposed by Swearer et al. [30] and Zhang et al. [43] combine plasmonic and catalytic metal nanoparticles in close proximity to form an antennaereactor complex, in which the plasmonic nanoparticle is the antenna and the catalytic particle is the reactor. The principle of this approach consists in making the nonplasmonic catalytic nanoparticle to be exposed within the regions of local electric fields induced by the LSPR excitation of the plasmonic metal. As portrayed in Figure 3a, this so-called antennaereactor concept was demonstrated using plasmonic Al nanocrystal antennas surrounded by a thin layer of Al2O3 and decorated with catalytic Pd reactors to drive the dissociation of H2 and reduction of acetylene. Interestingly, the plasmonic and the catalytic nanoparticles are not in direct contact in this example. Thus, the energy\ninduced to the Pd nanoparticles took place only via electromagnetic field enhancement from the plasmonic metal. Nonradiative plasmon decay and consequently hot carrier generation contributed to mediate the transformation in the catalytic metal. Regarding the catalytic performance (Figure 3b), this Al-Pd system hydrogenates acetylene toward ethylene under light illumination with significant selectivity [30,44]. In this example, it was evidenced that the plasmon-induced hot carriers on Pd nanoparticles lead to rapid desorption of H2, thus limiting the availability of hydrogen on the surface for additional hydrogenation of ethylene [30,44].\nIn a more recent work, Li et al. [45] explored how the structure of antennaereactor complexes governs their activity. They used a core@shell architecture in which plasmonic Ag was the core, surrounded by a thin layer of SiO2 which was decorated with Pt (Figure 3c). The influence of the Ag nanoparticle size (12, 25, 50, and 100 nm) was investigated on the plasmonic CO oxidation while keeping the SiO2 layer (10 nm) and Pt particle size (5 nm) constant. Figure 3d depicts the intensification of the electromagnetic field at the Pt surfaces as a function of Ag nanoparticle size. It can be clearly observed that the intensification of the electromagnetic field at the Pt-CO interface strongly depended on the size of the plasmonic core, achieving higher intensification for the larger nanoparticles. Regarding the plasmonic catalytic performance, column bars in Figure 3e evidence that antenna reactors with Ag nanoparticles with intermediate sizes (25 and 50 nm) present reaction rates more than four times larger than for smaller (12 nm) and larger (100 nm) nanoparticles. The simulations suggest that scattering prevails when Ag nanoparticles were too large, reducing photocatalytic reactivity (red trace in Figure 3e). On the other hand, a reduction in the local field enhancements at the Pt-CO interface was responsible for low activity in smaller Ag nanoparticles (blue trace in Figure 3e). Therefore, the authors concluded that the optimum performance of these multimetallic antenna reactors occurred under the most effective balance of photons absorbed and electromagnetic intensification at the Pt-CO interface [45].\nRecently, Zhou et al. [28] demonstrated that, by illuminating plasmonic antennaereactor photocatalyst, it is possible to reduce the activation barrier for ammonia decomposition by excitation of an absorbed nanoparticleereactant complex [28]. The plasmonic catalyst comprised a Cu-Ru surface alloy, in which the Cu acts as antenna and Ru as reactor sites. This system was synthesized by coprecipitation followed by annealing and reduction in the photoreaction chamber. The authors evidenced that the nanoparticleereactant interface can be very efficiently excited over the entire solar spectrum and the dissipation of energy of the\nCurrent Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 2019, 39:110–122\nassembly provides more efficient reaction pathways. Interestingly, for this Cu-Ru system, the photocatalytic reaction rate of NH3 decomposition was w20 and w177 times higher, respectively, relative to pure Cu and Ru nanoparticles. Also, the authors addressed quantitatively the influence of light conditions (l, I) in the activation barriers by exciting the nanoparticlereactant system. This work represents a breakthrough in the plasmonic catalysis as it was unraveled how the tuning of the carrier’s energy distribution in a plasmonic catalyst enables one to generate electrons having exactly the energy needed for a particular chemical reaction which could, in turn, modify chemical reaction pathways [28].\nOther nanoparticle designs that are used to marry catalytic and plasmonic properties in multimetallic nanostructures comprise catalytic metals decorated at the surface of plasmonic metals and plasmonic core-catalytic shell nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 4aed, Zheng et al. [46] synthesized Pt-modified Au nanorods for the plasmon-enhanced production of H2 from water and methanol. They compared two Pt deposition positions onto the Au nanorods and found that the Pt tipped sample exhibited much higher activity compared with the coreeshell samples (Figure 4e). This higher catalytic activity of the Pt-tipped Au nanorods was attributed to the fact that Pt was concentrated in the regions of higher electric field enhancements due to the excitation of the longitudinal LSPR mode in the Au nanorods. In this report, the authors shed light on the energy relaxation path of plasmon-generated hot electrons by combining single-particle spectroscopy with highmagnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These observations suggested the importance over the control of nanoparticle morphology over the plasmonic catalytic activities. They also demonstrated this phenomenon in Pd-Modified Au nanorods [47] and Pt-modified Au nanoprisms [48]. Further understanding of this system by correlating scattering, absorption, and photoluminescence of single Pt-decorated Au nanorods was recently reported by Jopling et al. [49].\nRegarding plasmonic core-catalytic shell materials, Aslam and Linic [50] reported on the synthesis of Au@Pt nanocubes (Figure 4fei). The authors showed that these structures enabled a great improvement on the plasmonic catalytic activity (Figure 4j) relative to Ag. Moreover, this bimetallic system was further used as a model system to study the energy flow between plasmonic and catalytic components, which influences the plasmonic catalytic performances in this nanoparticle design [51]. For example, it was found that the deposition of a thin Pt layer at the surface of Ag resulted in a plasmon decay pathway where absorption at the Pt sites predominates over scattering. This enabled an LSPR dissipation channel through the shell metal. These Ag@Pt plasmonic catalysts were then used to\nwww.sciencedirect.com\nperform the plasmon-enhanced preferential CO oxidation. It was demonstrated that the selective energy dissipation through the catalytically active Pt shell by LSPR excitation from the Ag core results in enhanced catalytic rates [29].\nIt is important to note that, from the examples discussed in this section, developments multimetallic nanostructures marrying plasmonic and catalytic\nwww.sciencedirect.com\ncomponents comprise two main categories: nanoparticle designs in which the plasmonic and catalytic components are not in direct contact (Figure 3) and nanoparticle designs having the plasmonic and catalytic components in direct contact (Figure 4). In these systems, the optimal features of the plasmonic metal will be different relative to what was described at the end of the section Plasmonic nanostructures with controlled shapes, sizes, and structures. For instance,\nCurrent Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 2019, 39:110–122\nwhen plasmonic and catalytic components are not in contact, both the plasmonic component and the distance between plasmonic and catalytic metals should be optimized for enabling the maximum enhancement of the electric fields as a result of LSPR excitation in the regions encompassing the catalytic metal. This is because these fields will enable the excitation of charge carriers in the catalytic metal. In this context, electric fields enhancements felt by the catalytic metal can be optimized by these key features: (i) control over nanoparticle shape, in which shapes that enable the presence of sharp tips (cubes and prisms, for example) can lead to the higher concentration of electric fields relative to their rounded counterparts as a result of the lightning rod effect [52,53]; (ii) generation of electromagnetic hot spots, as it has been established that the region of junctions between two or more nanoparticles can lead to electric field enhancements that are much larger than the individual nanoparticle counterparts as a result of plasmon hybridization (these hot spots can be achieved by preparing nanoparticle dimers or architectures that enable plasmon hybridization such as nanorattles) [40,54,55], (iii) control over plasmonic nanoparticle size, as it has been shown that the electric field enhancements are dependent on size [52,53,56]; and (iv) control over the distance between plasmonic and catalytic components, as the magnitude of electric field enhancements are distant-dependent relative to the surface of the plasmonic metal [57,58].\nOn the other hand, when plasmonic and catalytic components are in contact, the energy charge flow from the plasmonic to the catalytic component upon LSPR excitation should be optimized to enable the ‘extraction’ of charge carriers from the plasmonic to the catalytic metal or the formation of these charge carriers at the catalytic metal upon LSPR excitation [29,51]. In this case, the key desirable features for an optimized plasmonic catalyst are: (i) control over the generation of these charge carriers (maximization of absorption efficiencies relative to scattering) and (ii) the optimization of the energy flow as a result of plasmonic nanoparticle size and the electronic structure of the constituent metals. In general, nanoparticle sizes and shapes strongly influence the energy flow from the plasmonic to the catalytic components, in which sizes and shapes enabling higher electric field enhancements lead to improved energy flow [29,51]. Regarding the electronic structures, it is important that the catalytic metal should provide a pathway to the dissipation of energy from the plasmonic metal as a result of LSPR excitation. In this case, the catalytic metal should enable an efficient dissipation channel via absorption, which leads to the generation of energetic charge carriers at the surface of the catalytic metal as a result of the LSPR excitation from the plasmonic metal. This, in turn, that can be further used to accelerate the rates of molecular\nCurrent Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 2019, 39:110–122\ntransformations [29,51]. This energy flow can be favored when the catalytic metal possesses higher values of the imaginary part of the dielectric function (ε2) relative to the catalytic metal. In this scenario, catalytic metals display available fast direct electronic excitations (d to s), which can act as an efficient decay pathway for LSPR excited electric field enhancements, where a higher ratio of ε2 of the catalytic to plasmonic material leads to more energy transfer from the plasmonic to the catalytic component upon LSPR excitation [29,51]. This scenario can be observed for Ag and Pt combinations, for example [29,51].\nIn multimetallic plasmonic catalysts, it is also important to consider the interaction of photons with the catalytic components. While the extinction crosssections within catalytic (and nonplasmonic) metals are minor compared with plasmonic metals, it is noteworthy that important insights into the photocatalytic enhancement mechanisms can be gained by looking at the catalytic component of these systems. For example, by using Pt nanoparticles below 5 nm in size as model systems, it has been demonstrated that the photoexcitation of Pt enabled the direct excitation of metale adsorbate hybridized states as the dominant mechanism driving photochemistry [59]. This mechanism, in turn, led to the control over reaction selectivity toward the preferential oxidation of CO in H2 rich streams, opening new possibilities for the control over reaction selectivity with light [59]. This mechanism (direct photoexcitation of metal adsorbate bonds) can also be exploited in plasmonic catalysis to accelerate and control the selectivity of transformations. Moreover, by using Ag@SiO2@Pt NPs as model systems, the CO oxidation via Pt photoexcitation was also used as a model system to unravel the effect of the Ag NPs as antennas [45]. Specifically, this system enables the study of the relative roles of the plasmonic near-field enhancement, optical absorption, and multiple lights scattering events in a concentrated 3D catalyst bed geometry over the the efficiency of these photocatalysts.\nIn addition to conversion percentages, reaction selectivity represents a crucial issue in plasmonic catalysis. To tackle reaction selectivity, many strategies have been developed [19,20,60]. The majority of those rely on varying some reaction conditions as triggers to induce reaction selectivity. These include changing solvents, the concentration of reactants, temperature, pressure, time, pH values, photon energy, and photon flux [20,60]. The control over photon energy and photon flux was reported, for instance, by Yu et al. [19] in which by varying these reaction parameters, it was possible to enable control of mechanistic pathways and, thus, the selectivity of higher (C2) hydrocarbons over C1 products in plasmon-mediated CO2 reduction using Au NPs as plasmonic catalysts. Another important and well-\nwww.sciencedirect.com\nestablished strategy is to combine plasmonic metals with semiconductor materials [18,61].\nRegarding the few examples on the use of controlled nanostructures for enabling reaction selectivity in plasmonic catalysis, we highlight the work of Xiao et al [62]. The authors have shown that modifying the composition of plasmonic gold nanoparticles by alloying it with small amounts of copper can alter the reaction pathway of the catalytic reduction of nitroaromatics under visible light irradiation at ambient temperature. This allowed such chemical transformation to be performed in a highly selective manner toward aniline as a product. More recently, our group has demonstrated that by using multimetallic nanoparticles combining Au, Ag, and Pt in an Au@Ag@Pt coreeshell and an Au@AgPt nanorattle architectures, the reaction rates and more importantly selectivity of a sequential reaction (the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene) can be controlled under visible light illumination [63].\nThe control over reaction selectivity in plasmonic catalysis represents one of the most interesting aspects in the field. Here, we would like to present some hypotheses on the important factors and potential mechanisms that needed to be considered for targeting control over reaction selectivity in plasmonic catalysts. First, the adsorption geometry and energy for the molecule (substrate or intermediate involved in the rate-limiting step) at the surface of the nanoparticle should be considered. For instance, the adsorption geometry and energy can be tailored by changing the nature of the surface facets (control over nanoparticle shape) and composition at the surface. Specifically, distinct adsorption geometries can influence which groups or sites of the molecule are attached to the surface and therefore influence which of these sites will react or be preferentially activated under LSPR excitation. Moreover, the control over adsorption geometry and energy can affect the electronic states at the metalemolecule interface. In this case, the direct excitation of specific metaleadsorbate hybridized states can be exploited to improve reaction selectivity under LSPR excitation by controlling the light wavelengths, that is, using light with the energy that matches the energy required for the direct excitation of specific metaleadsorbate hybridized states. This strategy can thus benefit from control over nanoparticle shape, surface composition, nature of the substrates or intermediates, adsorption geometries and energies, and ground and excited state potential energy surfaces. Second, the reaction pathway under plasmonic catalysis should be considered. In this case, a change or control over the reaction pathway under LSPR excitation as compared with thermal catalysis can lead to the distinct activation of intermediates, favor their desorption from the surface, or change intermediates formed at the nanoparticle surface, for example. This\nwww.sciencedirect.com\ncan serve as an effective strategy to change the nature of the products that are formed under plasmonic catalysis. This can be achieved as a result of the control over the composition at the surface, the plasmonic properties, and attributes of the light source, such as energy and intensity.\nConclusions and outlook In this review, we discussed the study of several nanomaterials based on catalytic and plasmonic metals as model systems in plasmonic catalysis. Owing to their well-defined and controlled physical and chemical features, such as size, shape, surface composition, and morphology, their use enables to gain fundamental understanding in terms of enhancement mechanisms, reaction pathways, and performances under light illumination.\nNoble metal nanoparticles having monometallic compositions, such as Ag and Au, represent the most used materials in plasmonic catalysis. The availability of synthetic protocols for their controlled synthesis has propelled several studies on the establishment of structureeperformance relationships in plasmonic catalysis. Nonetheless, an unavoidable side effect of the use of Ag and Au nanoparticles is that they are inherently not very chemically reactive toward a variety of transformations. This severely limits the scope of chemical transformations allowed to be performed on their surfaces via plasmonic catalysis. Therefore, bimetallic catalytic-plasmonic nanoparticle morphologies enable one to marry plasmonic and catalytic metals in the same nanoparticle that can pave the way for more widespread applications of plasmonic catalysis. However, although this approach is interesting, the controlled synthesis of multimetallic plasmonic-catalytic nanoparticles with well-controlled physical and chemical features remains challenging. Therefore, we believe that there is a lot of progress that needs to be made in this area. In this context, the development of well-defined nanoparticle morphologies containing plasmonic and catalytic components is central to understand and enable energy flow between plasmonic and catalytic components, the optimization and tuning of their physical and chemical features (size, nature of exposed facets, surface composition, defect sites), and to establish structureeperformance relationships. These features are crucial to enable a transition to a design-driven approach in plasmonic catalysis, in which the materials can be planned and prepared in advance based on a desired reactivity and enhancement of reaction rates under light excitation.\nAnother important issue refers to the development of alternative plasmonic materials that do not rely on the use of expensive and noble metals. Although some progress has been made based on the utilization of Cu,\nCurrent Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 2019, 39:110–122\navoiding its oxidation represents an important challenge [28,64,65]. Interestingly, advances in plasmonics have been achieved in other non-noble metals such as Al, Bi, Ga, In, Pb, Tl, and Sn [42]. These elements normally present their LSPR at the UV region. However, the plasmonic band of Al has already been expanded onto the visible side of the spectrum by shape control [66,67]. A crucial feature of these materials is that they rely on low-cost and earth-abundant elements that can either be manufactured into plasmonic monometallic and multimetallic nanocatalysts [28,43]. In this way, one can greatly minimize costs of plasmon-mediated chemical transformations, which can facilitate the transferring of this technology to real-world and large-scale chemical processes.\nAnother equally important family of materials that can support LSPR in the visible is plasmonic semiconductor nanocrystals such as CdO, InO3, ZnO, MoO3-x, WO3-x, and CuS. They are also based on low-cost and earthabundant elements. Nonetheless, unlike many plasmonic nanomaterials, they can have their LSPR properties modulated by synthetically varying their doping level, shape, and size, and postsynthetically via chemical oxidation and reduction, photochemical control, and electrochemical control [68]. This may open entirely new ways to capitalize on harvesting LSPR-excited hot carriers toward catalytic transformations. This has the potential to bring these materials to the forefront for the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy via plasmonic catalysis.\nDespite important progress made regarding the establishment of structureeperformance relationships in plasmonic catalysis as well as on the mechanism understanding comprising enhancements of reaction rates, an issue that must be addressed and remains challenging comprises the control over reaction selectivity. To address selectivity, identifying and rationalizing active sites, selectivity mechanisms, the role of hot carries and charge transfer mechanisms, and interfacial electronic structure under light illumination must be unraveled. The development of in situ and operando studies represents promising approaches to address these challenges.\nThe future for plasmonic catalysis looks very promising in terms of solar to chemical energy conversion. It can play a fundamental role toward a sustainable future, owing for substantial impacts in the economy and environment. It becomes clear that the synthetic development of nanoparticles that enable one to maximize light harvesting as well as combining optical and catalytic properties can pave the way not only toward improved performances but also to the discovery of new reactivities, reaction pathways, and the understanding of enhancement mechanisms under visible light illumination.\nCurrent Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 2019, 39:110–122\nFunding This work was supported by FAPESP (grant number 2015/26308-7) and by the Serrapilheira Institute (grant number Serra-1709-16900).

This field, named plasmonic catalysis, has emerged as a new frontier in nanocatalysis. For metals such as silver (Ag), gold (Au), and copper (Cu), the LSPR excitation can take place in the visible and near-infrared ranges, opening possibilities for the conversion of solar to chemical energy and new/alternative reaction pathways not accessible via conventional, thermally activated catalytic processes. As both catalytic and optical properties can be tuned by controlling several physical and chemical parameters at the nanoscale, design-controlled nanomaterials open the door to unlock the potential of plasmonic catalysis both in terms of fundamental understanding and optimization of performances. In this context, after introducing the fundamentals of plasmonic catalysis, we provide an overview on the current understanding of this field enabled by the utilization of designed-controlled nanostructures based on plasmonic and catalytic metals as model systems. We start by discussing trends in plasmonic catalytic performances and their correlation with nanoparticle size, shape, composition, and structure. Then, we highlight how multimetallic compositions and morphologies containing both catalytic and plasmonic components enables one to extend the use of plasmonic catalysis to metals that are important in catalysis but do not support LSPR excitation in the visible range. Finally, we focus on key challenges and perspectives that are critically important to assist us in designing future energy-efficient plasmonic-catalytic",
