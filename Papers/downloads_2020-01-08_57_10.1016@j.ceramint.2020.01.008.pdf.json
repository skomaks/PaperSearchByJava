      "text" : "Compounds such as nitrides, borides, and carbides of the transition metals, which are located in the fourth and fifth groups of the periodic table and have melting points higher than 3000 °C, are known as ultrahigh temperature ceramics [1–10]. Zirconium diboride (ZrB2) belongs to these kinds of materials and melts at a temperature of 3245 °C. This substance owns strong covalent bonds and a hexagonal crystal structure. With a density of 6.1 g/cm3, ZrB2 provides excellent high-temperature strength [11–17]. Despite the superior physical and mechanical characteristics, there are also some limitations that should be taken into account. This material has a poor sinterability owing to its covalent bonds and slight penetration through the volume and grain boundaries; therefore, high sintering temperature and high external pressure would be needed to reach a fully dense part [14,18–24]. Moreover, using this material for some specific applications has some difficulties due to its low oxidation resistance at high temperatures and poor mechanical qualities [25–28].\nLots of research work has been implemented to overcome the mentioned limitations. The influences of two different kinds of additives, namely reinforcements and sintering aids, have been studied on the mechanical characteristics and microstructural features of as-\nsintered ZrB2-based materials [29–36]. Reinforcement additives, such as carbides, improve the qualities through hindering aggressive grain growth, and sintering aids, such as metallic, nitride, and carbonaceous materials, increase the sinterability [37–44]. It should be mentioned that ZrB2–SiC is the most famous ZrB2-matrix composite that has received quite a few researches. SiC reinforcement provides a wide range of particle size, shape, and morphology that can result in various characteristics in the ZrB2-based composites. Improving the sinterability, densification behavior, toughness, hardness, bending strength, and resistance to oxidation are among the most significant influences of adding silicon carbide to the zirconium diboride-matrix composites [45–53]. In addition, the application of a newly developed sintering method, named spark plasma sintering (SPS) process, can lead to obtaining better mechanical properties because of its inherent characteristics, low working temperature, short holding time, and possible application of an external pressure [54–69]. A near fully dense composite specimen was obtained when ZrB2–C composite specimens sintered at 1900 °C for 2 h by the hot-press technique. Due to the presence of the soft phase of carbon, the hardness of samples decreased when more carbon additive was added to the composites [48]. The ZrB2-20 vol% SiC-5 vol% black carbon composite specimens were produced using the hot-press process at a temperature of 1900 °C. Adding black carbon led\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.008 Received 29 November 2019; Received in revised form 1 January 2020; Accepted 2 January 2020\n∗ Corresponding author. ∗∗ Corresponding author.

The fracture toughness of composite samples remarkably rose in comparison with the monolithic specimens, standing at 6.6 MPa m2, but the hardness and bending strength reduced gradually [70]. The ZrB2–SiC–C composites were manufactured through the pressure-less sintering of ZrB2 powders coated with polycarbosilane at 2000 °C, resulting in a relative density of 96.7% [71]. By adding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to the specimens processed through hot pressing technique at 1900 °C for 1 h with an applied pressure of 30 MPa, the fracture toughness grew up by 15%, but no noticeable changes were observed in the hardness, bending strength, and thermal conductivity values [72]. A drop in the bending strength and an improvement in fracture toughness were reported for the specimens sintered at 2000 °C by hot press method and reinforced with short carbon fibers [73–75]. The fracture toughness of zirconium diboride - 20 vol% silicon carbide - matrix composites strengthened with adding 10 vol% graphite flakes while bending strength and hardness values dropped marginally [76–78]. Lots of researches have been accomplished to study the influences of carbon additives on the microstructure, consolidation manner, and mechanical characteristics of ZrB2-matrix composite materials. However, no study was found on the influences of diamond addition on the qualities of zirconium diboride matrix composites. In this investigation, therefore, four series of ZrB2-25 vol% SiC-based samples with different weight percentages (0, 1, 2, and 3) of nano-diamond were produced using SPS method at 1900 °C, a holding time of 7 min, and an applied pressure of 40 MPa."

      "text" : "The technical information of commercially available initial powders, namely ZrB2, SiC, and nano-sized diamond, is reported in Table 1. The initial powders were weighted according to the compositions shown in Table 2. The mixtures of powders were prepared by the ultrasonic method in ethanol medium for 60 min and mixed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min to obtain complete homogeneous mixtures. Afterward, the prepared slurries were heated on a hot plate agitator and then in an oven to eliminate ethanol and to dry completely, respectively, followed by crushing and sieving the dried mixtures. Then, the final mixtures were loaded into a graphite die and processed using a spark plasma sintering apparatus (Nanozint 10i, Khala Poushan Felez, Iran) at 1900 °C for 7 min under an external pressure of 40 MPa. After cooling, the as-sintered samples (diameter of 30 mm) were removed from the die and the available graphite layers on the specimens were eliminated by grinding. The rule of mixtures and Archimedes’ principles were implemented to calculate the theoretical density and the bulk density of SPSed composite samples, respectively. The densities of initial materials of ZrB2, SiC, and nano-diamond were assumed as 6.1, 3.2, and 3.5 g/cm3, respectively, according to the information provided by the suppliers. The microscopical evaluation was accomplished by a FESEM (Tescan Mira3) equipped with an EDS (DXP-X10P) to implement the elemental examination. The phase analysis of sintered materials was accomplished using an XRD (Philips PW1730), and the HSC software (Outokumpu, Finland) was used to study the feasibility of possible chemical reactions over the sintering process. The hardness of as-produced composite samples was determined by a Vickers hardness device (KM2/01–92123, Koopa Pazhoohesh, Iran) using a load of 5 kg\nfor 15 s dwell time. Finally, the fracture toughness of specimens was determined by measuring the length of the cracks generated after applying the Vickers indentation based on the Anstis formula (Eq. (1)):\n⎜ ⎟= ⎛ ⎝ ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝\n⎞ ⎠ K E H L C 0.016IC v\n1/2\n3/2 (1)\nwhere E, L, Hv, and C are elastic modulus, indentation load, Vickers hardness, and half-length of the radial cracks, respectively."

      "text" : "Fig. 1 exhibits the relative densities of SPSed ZrB2–SiC-based composite samples. A near fully dense specimen was obtained for the one with no nano-diamond content, reaching an RD of 99.9%. When 1 wt% nano-diamond was added to the ZrB 2-25 vol% SiC system, the ZSD1 sample reached a relative density of 100%. Although the most significant value of RD was related to the ZSD1 specimen, those with 0 and 2 wt% nano-diamond can also be considered as the fully dense materials with relative densities of 99.9%. It can, therefore, be claimed that the sintering circumstances were utterly suitable to attain the porosityfree composite specimens. However, adding 3 wt% nano-diamond had a destructive influence on the relative density of the samples, as RD of the ZSD3 sample dropped by ~1.2% in comparison with the fully dense ones. The XRD analysis result of the SPSed ZSD3 specimen (Fig. 2) reveals peaks associated with the ZrB2 matrix and secondary phase of SiC (α-type with hexagonal structure). Nevertheless, nano-diamond peaks were not available, showing the possibility of full consumption of diamond additive during the sintering process. The XRD results also revealed the formation of Graphite, ZrC, and B4C phases during the process. Accordingly, a proportion of nano-diamond additive turned into the graphite phase and the remaining reacted with other initial materials, which led to the production of the mentioned carbide phases. It seems that the diamond additive reacted with the oxide layers of B2O3 and ZrO2 on ZrB2 and SiO2 on SiC particles. Actually, the elimination of such phases in ZrB2 matrix composites and other non-oxide phases is essential because they can lead to aggressive grain growth and porosity trap into the ZrB2 grains. Fig. 3 presents the Gibbs free energy of the probable chemical reactions among the SiC/nano-diamond additives\nand the available oxide layers on the starting powders. These reactions can result in the reduction of such harmful phases and consequently, the generation of fine SiC and ZrB2 grains. Although silicon carbide is known as a stable phase in composite materials, a chemical reaction among SiC and oxide layers can probably occur thermodynamically on the ZrB2 particles at temperatures higher than 1760 °C (Eq. (2)). Therefore, new fine zirconium diboride grains can form with high sinterability. The by-product gaseous phases in Eq. (2) can leave the furnace due to the vacuum condition and the application of external pressure.\n5SiC + 2ZrO2 + B2O3 = 2ZrB2 + 5 SiO (g) + 5CO (g) (2)\nSimilar to SiC, the carbonaceous phase (nano-diamond) can be also beneficial in eliminating the unwanted oxide layers (Eq. (3)). Diamond is thermodynamically a more powerful reducer agent compared with SiC, so the chemical reaction (Eq. (3)) occurred at a lower temperature (1515 °C).\n5C + ZrO2 + B2O3 = ZrB2 + 5CO (g) (3)\nNot only the nano-diamond additive can eliminate the oxide layers on the zirconium diboride particles, but it can also be helpful in\neliminating the unwanted surface phases on the SiC particles, especially SiO2, based on Eq. (4). This reaction is thermodynamically possible at temperatures higher than 1515 °C.\n3C + SiO2 = SiC + 2CO (g) (4)"

      "heading" : "3.2. Microstructural evaluation",
      "text" : "Fig. 4 exhibits SEM images of the fracture and polished surfaces of the ZSD0 sample. The presence of the ZrB2 phase (bright-colored) and SiC phase (dark-colored) is apparent in these images. As was mentioned before, this composite roughly reached its theoretical density; thus, the availability of no porosity in the micrograph makes sense. The average grain size of zirconium diboride is almost the same as that of the initial ZrB2 powder (2 μm). Literally, the presence of SiC as a secondary phase played a significant role in obtaining a fine microstructure because of inhibiting extensive grain growth. The SEM images of the polished surface of the ZSD1 specimen and the related EDS examination results are shown in Fig. 5. The microstructural evaluation also confirmed the achievement of a relative density of 100%. The EDS analysis indicated an area rich in carbon, boron, and zirconium elements, which can indicate the existence of in-situ formed ZrC and B4C phases. This follows the phrasal and thermodynamic evaluations pointed out before.\nDue to the addition of more nano-diamond amount, more in-situ products can be produced in the ZSD2 sample with no detectable pores (Fig. 6), following the results obtained for the relative density. It should also be mentioned that the black holes do not belong to the porosities, but they formed due to the polled-out hard phases during the grinding and polishing stages. The formation of the mentioned in-situ phases, namely ZrC and B4C, was indicted in the SEM images of the ZSD3 specimen and the related EDS analysis (Fig. 7 c and d). Clearly, the EDS results prove the availability of Zr, C, and B-enriched phases. Moreover, Fig. 7a follows the calculated RD (98.8%) obtained for the ZSD3 specimen due to the presence of the pores in the microstructure. Apparently, adding very high nano-diamond had a negative impact on the densification of ZrB2-25 vol% SiC-based composites with reducing the sinterability."

      "text" : "Fig. 8 displays the Vickers hardness of SPSed composite samples. It is known that relative density is one of the chief parameters affecting the mechanical properties of sintered materials. As the pores have no\nresistance against an indenter, a porous material provides a low level of hardness. In other words, a porous sample offers lower hardness values compared with the densified ones. The sample with no nano-diamond additive reached a hardness of 19.5 GPa, while all other samples doped with nano-diamond (namely ZSD1, ZSD2, and ZSD3) presented higher values of hardness (23.4, 24.6, and 22.2, respectively). It seems that the formation of in-situ carbide phases, which have high hardness values, led to an increment in the hardness of samples doped with nano-diamond. Besides, the formation of such in-situ phases can result in locking the dislocations and consequently, higher values of hardness. The lower hardness of the ZSD3 sample is due to the presence of 1.2% porosity in the microstructure. The calculated values of fracture toughness of assintered composite samples are represented in Fig. 9. These values were determined by measuring the length of the cracks formed due to the application of Vickers indenter. For instance, the place of the indentation mark and the propagated cracks in the ZSD1 sample are exhibited in Fig. 10. The fracture toughness of samples rose linearly from 4.3 MPa m1/2 (ZSD0) to 5.8 MPa m1/2 (ZSD3) with adding more nanodiamond additive. The route of the propagating crack in the ZSD0 specimen is illustrated in Fig. 11a. As it is clear, the presence of SiC secondary phases deflected the crack over its propagating route. Moreover, other toughening mechanisms including branching and bridging of crack(s) and also fracturing of secondary phase (SiC) are visible in this micrograph. Fig. 11b and c presents the SEM images of the propagated crack(s) after applying Vickers indentation. It seems that the cracks lost more energy when they struck the in-situ formed\nFig. 4.

Overall, the difference in thermal expansion coefficient of various available phases (ZrB2, SiC, ZrC, B4C, and graphite) can cause residual stresses at their interfaces during the cooling process from the ultimate sintering temperature to the room temperature. The interaction between the crack and microstructure is dominantly controlled by the residual stresses created owing to the incompatibility of thermal and mechanical characteristics of the phases. Moreover, the deflection of crack has a significant effect on the fracture toughness, which extremely influenced by different factors, and consequently more deflections on the way of crack can absorb more energy, leading to a higher value of fracture toughness [79–81].\nFig. 7.

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "Although adding 3 wt% nano-diamond had a destructive effect on the relative density of SPSed samples, the addition of 1 and 2 wt% of this additive had no significant influence on the RD of sintered samples. According to reaching the fully dense samples (ZSD0, ZSD1, and ZSD2), it seems that the sintering conditions (namely sintering dwell temperature, time and pressure of 1900 °C, 7 min, and 40 MPa, respectively) were suitable for these composite specimens. XRD assessment disclosed the formation of in-situ produced phases of ZrC and B4C during the SPS process. The most significant values of hardness (24.7 GPa) and fracture toughness (5.8 MPa m1/2) were obtained for the ZSD2 and ZSD3 samples, respectively, due to the existence of SiC and in-situ formation of new phases at the same time. Finally, the micrographic evaluation revealed the effect of different toughening mechanisms on obtaining higher values of fracture toughness in the samples doped with nano-diamond.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."

All samples were spark plasma sintered at 1900 °C under 40 MPa external pressure for 7 min. Relative density (RD) values higher than 99.9% were obtained for the samples with 0, 1, and 2 wt% nano-diamond, while adding 3 wt% diamond dropped the RD by ~1.2%. The XRD and microstructural evaluations revealed the formation of some in-situ phases, namely ZrC and B4C. The highest Vickers hardness (24.7 GPa) and fracture toughness (5.8 MPa m) were achieved for the samples doped with 2 and 3 wt% nano-diamond, respectively. Ultimately, the SEM micrographs indicated the role of different toughening mechanisms on obtaining such a high value of",
