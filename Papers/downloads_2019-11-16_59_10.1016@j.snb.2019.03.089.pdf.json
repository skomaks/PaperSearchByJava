      "text" : "Heavy metals are becoming a high concern in terms of human health and environment. Excessive concentration in drinking water may result in chronic diseases or even mortality [1–3]. One of the most hazardous is Hg (II). This element can be present in organic and inorganic forms, being both dangerous because of their toxicity and bioaccumulation in many species [4–6].\nOrganizations like World Health Organization (WHO) have established 30 nM as the top limit value for drinking water [7]. This has carried along the need for determination methods with high sensitivity. Some of the available methods include spectroscopic techniques such as Cold Vapour Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (CVAAS) [8] or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) [9], but these procedures are not suitable for in situ analysis because they require expensive instruments and qualified people. Electroanalytical methods, in contrast, allow simultaneous determination of several heavy metals at low cost, with minimum volume of sample and easy-to-use instruments [10]. Most of the heavy metals, like Hg (II) or Pb (II) can be determined by Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (ASV) [11,12]. Electrodes can be modified with conductive materials like polymers or with biological compounds to increase their conductivity and improve the sensitivity and selectivity of the sensors [13–16].\nFor the purpose of Hg (II) determination, gold is often the preferred electrodic material, because of its strong affinity for Hg. This can be used to enhance the preconcentration effect during the accumulation step [17,18]. It has been used as a bulk electrode or in the form of\nmicrodisks, but as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), their high surface areato-volume ratio results in both sensitivity and selectivity improvements [19–22]. AuNPs can be synthesized in situ by electrodeposition [23–25].\nSensitive Hg (II) determinations in water were achieved with glassy carbon [26,27], or screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) [28] modified with AuNPs and/or nanohybrids. SPCEs have advantages such as low cost and little amount of sample and reagents required. However, most of the ceramic SPCEs designed are usually discarded after one measurement because of the fouling of the surface. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop low-cost alternatives more feasible for developing countries such as transparency films [29] or paper [30–33].\nPaper is mainly composed of cellulose fibres which can be modified by the addition of hydrophobic materials such as wax, with the aim to form barriers that define the electrochemical cell. Cellulose can be modified with conductive ink to allow the study of electrochemical probes [34,35]. It can also be modified with nanoparticles increasing the conductivity and selectivity of the method [36], it is inexpensive and easy to destroy after use.\nHere, we have studied the utility of a nanostructured paper-based electrode as the working electrode of a simple and low-cost platform for Hg (II) in water. The paper substrate was modified with carbon materials such as graphene-oxide (GO) or carbon nanofibers (CNF) and with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to obtain a new and “easy-to-make” working electrode. It was connected to the auxiliary and reference electrodes of a screen-printed card having its own working electrode isolated from the sample. This ensures its use without any interference, and the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2019.03.089 Received 2 December 2018; Received in revised form 18 March 2019; Accepted 19 March 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

      "text" : "Whatman Grade 1 chromatographic paper was chosen as a cellulose substrate. A wax printer was used to print hydrophobic wax patterns on the paper. Paper patterns designs were made using Inkscape software. After melting the wax at 80 °C and cooling at room temperature, the paper was modified by addition of 2 μL of carbon ink solution by drop casting on one of the sides. In this way, a side was covered by ink (bottom side) and the other side was used to add nanomaterial and sample solutions (upper side). The carbon ink used to modify the cellulose paper was made by dispersion of the commercial carbon paste in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (concentration of 30% (w/ w)) in an ultrasound bath for one hour.\nFollowing a procedure previously developed in our group [34,38], the working electrode (WE) of the screen-printed platform as well as the ceramic surface that is located between the WE and auxiliary (AE) and reference (RE) electrodes, were covered by the cellulosic electrode. Every paper electrode was cut to obtain a circle with an area of 4mm2 as shown in Fig. 1. The carbon ink of the paper working electrode was covered by a protector. Then, an adhesive was sprayed and after removing the cover, the cellulosic electrode was placed over the WE of a screen-printed electrode card (SPE), in such a way that the carbon ink of the paper electrode contacted the WE of the SPE, as shown in Fig. 1B. With this methodology, there was no any interference from the adhesive spray. Before measurements were made, full overlap was verified. The solution was added on the upper side of the paper electrode that was not contacting the WE of the SPE, making sure there were no interferences from previous measurements. Then, the WE of the SPE remained unmodified, acting only as connection [34–36,38]. The SPE can be reused for an average of 7–8 measurements with no effect on the structure of the platform.\n2.3. Modification with carbon nanomaterials and gold nanoparticles\nPaper electrodes with carbon ink were modified with a combination of carbon nanomaterials followed by a generation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Both procedures are shown in Fig. 1(C1 and C2). Carbon nanomaterials were added before placing the paper electrode over the screen-printed card, whereas gold nanoparticles were generated afterwards. Graphene oxide added was also electrochemically reduced before the generation of gold nanoparticles. Hybrids of carbon nanomaterials with AuNPs were investigated to optimize the detection.\n2.3.1. Modification with carbon nanofibers (CNFs) Suspensions of CNFs were prepared in ultrapure water by solving an amount of CNFs in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h. An aliquot of 2 μL of a 1mg/mL nanofiber suspension was deposited onto the upper part of the paper and left to dry at room temperature before placing it on the screen-printed electrode card.\n2.3.2. Modification with graphene oxide (GO) Aliquots of 6 μL of GO (100mg/L) were added to the upper part of the paper and left to dry at room temperature. Graphene oxide needs to be reduced in order to remove oxide and hydroxide groups. Therefore, after placing it over the screen-printed electrode card, a constant cathodic current of−100 μA was applied and the reduction process was followed chronopotentiometrically in 0.1M NaOH, according to a procedure developed in our research group to generate reduced graphene oxide (rGO) [37].\n2.3.3. Modification with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) AuNPs were synthesized in situ by a method previously developed in our research group for screen-printed carbon electrodes [36] and successfully tested in paper-based electrodes [34,36]. AuNPs were electrogenerated after deposition of 40 μL of 1mM AuCl4− on a cellulose disk overlaying the surface of the working electrode, at the screenprinted card. A current of −100 μA was applied and the corresponding chronopotentiogram was recorded."

For the determination, standard additions were made by adding 100, 200 and 400 μL of 20 μM Hg (II) standard (in 0.1M HCl + 0.9M KCl, i.e. 1M Cl− background electrolyte) to 300 μL of the spiked sample and making up to 1mL with 1M Cl− background electrolyte.\nReal sample measurements and calibration plots were made by linear sweep voltammetry. 40 μL of sample solution were deposited on the electrochemical cell. Hg (II) in the samples was preconcentrated by applying a potential of +0.2 V for 600 s. Then, the reduced mercury was stripped from the electrode surface by scanning the potential in the anodic direction (Ei =+0.2 V, Ef =+0.6 V, Es =2mV and v=50mV/ s)."

      "text" : "3.1. Electrochemical behaviour of Hg (II) at carbon nanomaterials-AuNPs modified paper-based electrodes\nThe electrochemical processes of mercury on paper-based electrodes modified with both carbon nanomaterials and gold nanoparticles were studied by cyclic voltammetry using a 10−4 M Hg (II) acetate solution in 0.1 M HCl. This analyte was preconcentrated by applying a reduction potential of -0.35 V for 480 s, and then the potential was scanned in the positive sense. Fig. 2 shows the voltammograms obtained in CNFs/ AuNPs paper-based electrodes. Different amounts of KCl were added to improve the conductivity without increasing the acidity of the solution.\nThis could remove the adhesive and release the paper substrate from the screen-printed card. The three anodic peaks observed (in 0.1 M HCl + 0.9M KCl) at +41 (A3), +235 (A2) and +426 (A1) mV seem to form a redox pair with the three corresponding cathodic peaks at –14.8 (C3), +230 (C2) and +400 (C1) mV. The voltammogram is similar to that obtained by using AuNPs-SPCEs [37]. As it was described there, the redox pairs A1/C1 and A2/C2 correspond to the adsorption of Hg (II) ions on the surface of AuNPs, making an amalgam in a process called underpotential deposition (UPD), only observed at electrodes modified with AuNPs, as shown in Fig. 3 for these paper electrodes. The UPD corresponds to an electrochemical process that takes place at a more positive potential than the reversible Nernst potential for the formation of bulk metal. The first UPD process (A1/C1) occurs at +413mV (Epa + Epc/2), and a second UPD (A2/C2) at +230mV is normally observed when all AuNPs are saturated of mercury atoms, having hence a weaker influence. The anodic peak A3 at +41mV was also observed at unmodified paper electrodes, and therefore it was assigned to the bulk deposition of Hg at the carbon ink [39]. It was also present in paper modified with CNF and rGO (Fig. 3). The other anodic peak, that\nappears at a lower potential, could be related to the presence of chloride ions in the medium [40].\nIncreasing concentrations of KCl resulted on voltammograms with lower capacitance and better defined and more intense peaks (Fig. 2). The potential of the processes decreases slightly using more concentrated electrolyte, indicating that the oxidation processes result favoured. The best results were obtained with a 1M concentration of chloride ion. Higher concentrations did not make any improvement. Then, a 1M of chloride ion (i.e., 0.1 M HCl + 0.9M KCl) solution was employed as background electrolyte for the remainder of the work. UPDs peaks were better defined for CNFs/AuNPs paper-based electrodes in comparison with those modified with rGO/AuNPs. This could be due to the higher capacitance of the cellulose matrix modified with reduced graphene oxide. The effect of the carbon nanomaterials on the capacitive currents in absence of AuNPs can also be observed in Fig. 3.\nThe UPDs at AuNPs nanostructured electrodes are advantageous for sensitive and selective determination of low concentrations of Hg. Bulk deposition was only observed at higher concentrations. Bulk deposition at CNFs and rGO paper electrodes has low reproducibility and less selectivity in comparison with paper electrodes modified also with AuNPs, so they were not considered. On the other hand, the modification with carbon nanomaterials increases the reproducibility of the electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles. For this reason, the use of AuNPs paper electrodes with no carbon nanomaterials was discarded. In conclusion, a hybrid nanostructuration resulted then more convenient. The first UPD (A1/C1) was chosen for the development of the sensor for the determination of mercury (II) ions by anodic stripping voltammetry. Then, mercury was preconcentrated (reduction of Hg (II) to Hg (0)) at a potential more negative than C1. Then, a anodic potential sweep was applied for Hg redissolution (from Hg (0) to Hg (II)). The analytical signal measured was the intensity of the A1 peak current."

(D) Background voltammogram recorded in a 0.1M HCl +0.9M KCl solution.\nprocess). The difference on the potential value with respect to the anodic peak A1 could be due to the influence of the ion chloride Cl− on the pseudoreference electrode of Ag at the screen-printed card. It could partially form AgCl, changing the redox potential of mercury ions, therefore. Hg (II) was then determined by anodic stripping voltammetry, measuring the current intensity of the anodic peak around +380mV. A potential of +200mV was chosen for studying the influence of different electrodeposition times for both procedures (CNFs/ AuNPs and rGO/AuNPs). Square wave voltammetry (SWV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were evaluated. The most reproducible results were obtained with linear sweep voltammetry, by applying a potential of +200mV for 600 s (480 s for graphene oxide) as a preconcentrating step, followed by an anodic potential scan from +0.2 to +0.6 V.\nTo compare carbon nanomaterials and study the sensitivity of the analytical methodologies, both types of modified paper electrodes (CNFs/AuNPs and rGO/AuNPs) were tested for different concentrations of mercury (II) acetate. Fig. 4 shows two calibration plots for the hybrid structures CNFs/AuNPs and rGO/AuNPs. The best fit corresponded to the former, with CNFs/AuNPs (calibration line: Ipa (μA)=0.4461 [Hg (II)] – 0.0305, R2= 0.9969). The linear range was comprised between 0.1 and 1.2 μM. The limit of detection (LOD) for the hybrid nanostructuration with CNFs/AuNPs was calculated as 30 nM by the formula 3Sa/m, where Sa is the standard deviation of the blank and m is the slope of the calibration line, using the lower range concentration\nvalues. The capacitive current was lower for CNFs/AuNPs paper-based electrodes. In conclusion, this was the system chosen to analyse the river water samples.\nWater samples were taken from river Nora (Asturias, Spain). Mercury was not detected. Then, aliquots for mercury determination at the CNFs/AuNPs and rGO/AuNPs paper-based electrodes were prepared by spiking 1 μM of mercury (II) acetate. Solutions were analysed by the anodic stripping voltammetry method developed (Section 2.4). For the determination, standard additions were made to aliquots of 300 μL of the spiked sample. Then, different volumes of Hg (II) standard in 1M Cl− background electrolyte were added. The comparison of the standard addition line of the spiked samples with the calibration plot line indicated matrix effects (Fig. 5). This can be explained because of the different compounds from the matrix river which can alter the background of the solution and its conductivity. However, the method is based on the UPD electrodeposition of mercury (II) ions at the AuNPs surface, and subsequent anodic redisolution. The interference study at next section shows that the determination is quite selective nevertheless. Moreover, matrix effects could be corrected by using the standard addition method. Results indicated that 91% of the spiked concentration was recovered, being still a suitable alternative to study real samples. Samples were also analysed by the method previously developed at AuNPs and SPCEs [39]. The results obtained at the SPCEs (97%) were consistent with those obtained at paper-based electrodes developed in this study."

CNFAuNPs paper electrodes were used for Hg (II) quantification by the optimized procedure for the 1st UPD described in section 3.2. No variation of the oxidation peak intensity was observed, showing no signs of interference for these metals and confirming the selectivity of the method. All combinations were studied by triplicate.\nThe analytical characteristics reported in the literature for mercury ions determination by using paper devices are shown in Table 1. Most of mercury sensors in published paper-based devices are based on a colour change response due to the binding with specific ligands. These need normally higher quantity of reagents and more expensive detectors, limiting the portability. Electrochemical paper devices are more selective and the affinity with gold nanoparticles improves their sensitivity, but their uses are still scarce. The sensor developed in this work has the advantages of using a fast and low-cost modification procedure. The electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles with the high conductivity of carbon nanomaterials allows reaching a limit of detection of 30 nM, suitable for safety control in waters. As an additional advantage, mercury stays in the cellulose fibers of the working paper electrode, and therefore the screen-printed platform can be reused without any contamination, reducing the analysis cost. In regard to waste management, the single-use paper electrode can be easily disposed, because of its small size."

The bare screenprinted electrode used remained free of mercury after the measurement. CNFs and rGO improve the conductivity of the electrode whereas electrodeposited AuNPs allow the sensitive and selective determination of Hg (II). By using the underpotential deposition of mercury on AuNPs, a limit of detection of 30 nM was obtained when both nanomaterials (CNFs and AuNPs) were used to modify the cellulose substrate. The determination was not affected by the presence of Zn (II), Cd (II), Pb (II) and Cu (II) ions. Mercury could be determined in spiked river samples (91% recovery and 6.2% RSD). The nanostructured paper-based electrode developed in this work could be the basis for a low-cost mercury sensor by electrochemical devices in paper platforms."

The AuNPs helped the electrodeposition of Hg (II) at more positive potentials, due to their affinity for mercury. The determination was possible up to 1.2 μM with no interference of other heavy metals such as Cd (II), Pb (II), Cu (II) and Zn (II).
