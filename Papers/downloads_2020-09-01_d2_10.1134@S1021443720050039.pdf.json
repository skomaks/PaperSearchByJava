The non-autonomous control in plants is highly regulated and maintained by specific elements, which may either be active or passive in their function. These small elements are regarded as passive channels known as plasmodesmata. Plasmodesmata are the central keystone components that work in a highly coordinated and cohesive manner. Plasmodesmata can be defined as endoplasmic reticulum spanned structure that form cytoplasmic continuum between cells for the exchange of material. These cytoplasmic intracellular continuums of plasmodesmata constitute the primary mode for the transport of materials. The positional information required for growth and development of any complex multicellular organism is facilitated by these plasmodesmata [1, 2]. Ultrastructural study revealed that plasmodesmata have size exclusion limit (SEL) ranging from 850 D for free trafficking of micro-molecules that can be configured to around 10000 D (10 kD) for transport of macromolecules [3, 4]."

In order to furnish the requirement between or within the tissue, the exchange of material and signaling is controlled actively in a discriminating manner [8]. The plasmodesmatal exchange mechanism may be regulated either by regulatory proteins or gating phenomenon, as summarized in Fig. 1, by some contractile proteins and callose deposition around the plasmodesmal opening [9]. It is not only the callose deposition but some other components of cell wall that regulate plasmodesmatal exchange, whose functions are not well clear [10]. Hence further studies are required to unravel the mechanism.\n(1) The transcriptional factors, RNAs of viruses usually pass through the gated plasmodesmata. However, all this occurs under the control of regulatory proteins [11]. Several proteins confined to plasmodesmata are known to regulate the permeability of plasmodesmata. A GPI anchor fitted extracellular protein binds to callose encoded by plasmodesmata callose binding protein 1 (PDCB1) observed in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of PDCB1 intensifies the callose at plasmodesmata [12]. A plasma membrane protein lysine motif domain containing GPI-anchored protein 2 (LYM 2) is reported to be build up at plasmodes-\nRUSSIAN JOURN\nmata [13]. LYM2 protein regulates the permeability of plasmodesmata via an unknown callose dependent mechanism. Eight members of plasmodesmata located protein (PDLP) family consist of extracellular and cytoplasmic domain bearing membrane spanning protein reported in Arabidopsis [14]. The pdlp2 pdlp3 and pdlp1 pdlp3 double mutant are recognized by presence of non-autonomous amplified GREEN FLOURESCENT PROTEIN (GFP) movement. The overexpression of PDLP5 tempts to dwindle the plasmodesmatal permeability. PDLP5 acts on callose synthase1 (CalS1) and CalS8 to promote the deposition of callose at plasmodesmata, thus allowing the cell to cell movement [15].\n(2) Contractile proteins regulate the gating phenomenon of plasmodesmata and these proteins are actin, myosin or myosin VIII (calcium regulated unconventional myosin). More precisely their localization at plasmodesmata is elucidated by the occurrence of negative effects in non-autonomous movement when actin filaments are perturbed [16].\n(3) Alteration in the proteinaceous spokes of plasmodesmata allows the frequent transport of exchangable materials. The change in Ca2+ ion concentration [17] and calcium binding protein centrin dephosphorylation causes momentary plasmodesmal narrowing. The increase in the plasmodesmatal permeability supported\nAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY Vol. 67 No. 5 2020\nby an endogenous plant protein KNOTTED 1 (KN1) has been expressed by a homeobox gene knotted1 [18].\nPlasmodesmatal regulation results from the callose (β-1,3-D-glucan) deposition and subsequent degradation due to interacting action of two enzymes: β-1,3-D-glucan synthase and β-1,3-D-glucanase [19]. The transient decrease in SEL is accomplished by the action of plasma membrane bound enzyme β-1,3-Dglucan synthase in combination with its activator furfuryl-α-glucoside under the influence of temporary rise in cytoplasmic calcium. The other hydrolyzing enzyme β-1,3-D-glucanase, results in removal of callose. For instance, β-1,3-glucanases degrade the callose associated with plasmodesmata for the continous restoration that comes after the chilling induced dormancy period and results in the activation of meristems [20]. Crucial genes documented to regulate the plasmodesmatal callose level are A. thaliana β-1, 3-glucanase (AtBG), AtBG putative plasmodesmatal associated protein (AtBG ppap), plasmodesmatal localized β-1,3-glucanase (PDBGs) and callose synthase (CalS) family. The CalS family involves CalS1/GSL6, CalS8/CalS8, CalS3/GSL12 and CaLS10/GSL8/CHORUS. Mutant of PDBG1 or PDBG2 are characterized by appearance of elevated callose depositions and abnormal lateral root formation [21]. The cals10 mutant is pursuing seedling lethality and abnormal phenotypes such as alteration in normal guard cell patterning, cell division and permeability in plasmodesmata. Moreover, cals3 mutant having gain of function mutation is displaying peak in callose concentration in addition to abnormal root development [22]."

Subsequently, fertilization is symplastically isolated from the surrounding tissues. In soybean and Arabidopsis, plasmodesmatal connections from embryo to endosperm except in the suspensor region that allow movement of material from mother tissue were seen [24]. The branching pattern of plasmodesmata shows alteration during the development of suspensor and embryo. Mutant analysis reveals the role of silencing of INCREASE SIZE EXCLUSION LIMIT 1 (ISE1) or ISE2 genes in leaves that may increase intercellular transport [25].

      "text" : "The TMV movement protein (MP) has the potential to elucidate the mechanism of transport via plasmodesmata. The ability of cell to maintain its plasmodesmata SEL for inetrcellular transport can be explained by fusion of GFP with the TMV proteins. Embryogenesis has been established as an adequate plantform to unravel the physiological and molecular regulation confined through plasmodesmatal channels [24]. The intercellular movement of fused proteins during most of embryonic stages confers the crucial role of plasmodesmata as follow.\n(1) Globular stage. Evidences from the study on Arabidopsis with the sucrose 3 (SUC3): GFP florescent compounds exemplify continuous movement of material within the cells of suspensor during globular stage.\n(2) Heart stage. In Crassulaceae ovules, suspensor cell plasmodesmata become more complex and may be plugged in immature embryo [26]. In Arabidopsis, the movement of plasmodesmata is also blocked. AtGL2 promoter expressed only in hypocotyl epidermis causes the expression of GFP and its existence was found throughout the embryo that emphasizes the presence of plasmodesmatal connection between the cells of embryos [27]. Moreover, studies using transcriptional factor TARGET OF MONOPYEROS 7 (TMO7) illustrate free movement into specific cell called hypophysis (founder cell for the primary root meristem) in the developing seedling [28]. The positioning of plasmodesmata during early embryogenesis is highly specific and even partially separated. In endosperm, the distribution is simple and high whereas, it is reduced and pronouncedly branched in heart stage. In members of Crassulaceae family, the plasmodesmata between the suspensor and endosperm are connected symplastically that limit the need of cellular boundary. However, the occurrence and functioning of plasmodesmata is typically blocked or may be slightly active at a very early stage or before the globular stage. This interaction of plasmodesmata at embryonic level suggests possible transport relation between suspensor and endosperm cells that lack apoplastic transport or dependent only upon symplastic mode of transportation [28].\n(3) Torpedo stage. Diffused movement of SUC3 promoter derived GFP in the whole embryo starting from the root tip has been observed. This movement revealed the presence of symplastic continuity and can play role in the distribution of material between cells up to the mid torpedo stage [27].

      "heading" : "Development of Shoot Apical Meristem",
      "text" : "Shoot apical meristem (SAM) can be divided into two groups, outer peripheral region and central region on the basis of their origin or structure. The variable developmental behaviour is maintained by their cytoplasmic continuum connection [18, 29]. The central region shows pluripotency, while the outer peripheral region is involved in differentiation and organ formation. Generally, the plasmodesmatal movements are restricted between these two separate entities but movements may take place during some specific periods as in case of new leaf formation. The plasmodesmatal discontinuity may help to prevent the movement of morphogens to undesired location and restrict them into particular site. With the aid of clonal analysis of Arabidopsis, a group of stem cells responsible for generation of all the tissue of shoot was found. Evidences from clonal analysis in maize support the viewpoint that some germ cells remain as such which later on give rise to tassel from the main stem. These germ cells are derived initially from the stem cells in the early stages of development. This tassel is produced only after a minimum number of leaves are generated from the apical meristem. Such positional information was determined during earlier stages of development suggested that they remain cytoplasmically isolated from the surrounding cells and may be required to maintain its identity. Comparative account on morphology study reveals that the shoot meristem is differentiated early in the embryonic apex into two regions: the peripheral cotyledonary primordia and the central apical initials. For the cellular differentiation as well as for maintenance of stem cell in the SAMs, cell to cell exchange of positional information is facilitated by plasmodesmata [30, 31].\nThe shoot apical meristem has distinct cell layers in its central zone and categorized as L1, L2 and L3, from epidermis to cortex of meristematic tissue. These distinct cell layers contain their own stem cells for their respective fate, e.g., L1 determines epidermal tissue; L2 determines cortical tissue, while L3 determines the conducting vascular tissue. The functioning of the layers is restricted and specific. A study on tomato indicates that a developmental signal processed to form floral size and the number of carpals, whereas the tissue was derived from the cells of L2 and L1 layers but the signal was originally synthesized in the L3 layer cells. KN1 transcriptional factor, the first factor to be discovered in maize translocated through plasmodesmata into the L1 layer from L2 layer. Evidences from the cells of tobacco leaf and SAM show that mRNA of KN1 protein gets translocated through plasmodesmata by modifying its SEL. In addition to KN1, viral RNA and protein molecules are also transmitted through\nRUSSIAN JOURN\nthe plasmodesmata. KN1 moves from one cell to another cell with the involvement of its receiving molecule and unfolding protein chaperone by increasing SEL [32]. For the translocation of CMV, similar receiving molecule or previously involved receptors are required for movement of KN1. The recent work evidenced some results in favor of a common molecule involved in the translocation of viral as well as plant selfproteins that increase the SEL [23]. Some transcriptional factors responsible for regulation of floral development translocate through these intercellular connections, as summarized in Fig. 2. Transcriptional factor LEAFY (LFY) in Arabidopsis and DEFICIENS (DEF) in Antirrhinum f lowers move through plasmodesmata whose mRNA is generated in specific cells. Another transcriptional factor, GNARLEY1 observed in the leaves of maize, shows its progression in a particular direction [33]. A gene family known as CLA (CLAVATA) is required to prolong functional status of SAM in Arabidopsis, i.e. CLA3, binds with transmembrane serine/threonine kinase, CLA1 signaled the pathway to regulate transcriptional factor. For proper growth, it is proposed that the translocation of CLA3-RNA into inner layer of SAM occurs, to induce CLV transduction pathway [34]. Not only the transcriptional factors but non-transcriptional factors were recognized as non-autonomous proteins, for example type-A ARABDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (ARR7), ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN 6 (AHP6) the cytokinin signaling inhibitor and DWARF14 (D14) in rice [35, 36]."

      "text" : "Sieve plate pores are one of the best example to explain the importance of plasmodesmata in developmental process as their presence is specific as they are located in the cells to facilitate the translocation of material between cells [37]. The modification of plasmodesmata is to widen the pores of sieve plate to furnish the mass flow of valuable material in the phloem. Plasmodesmata allow the transfer of sucrose, sugar alcohols, signaling molecules and other photosynthetic active material from mesophyll cells to phloem [38]. Sieve plate pore is the modification of primary plasmodesmata produced after modification at maturation. Maturation of sieve plate pore is achieved by the removal of callose deposition which usually functions to regulate the f low of substances. In addition to callose degradation there is also extinction of appressed endoplasmic reticulum, both of which supplement to widen the pore. In CALS7 Arabidopsis mutant, transitory callose deposition takes place at the time of synthesis of sieve pore. Loss of functional mutation in CALS7 shows reduced callose deposition with limited size and number of pore on sieve plate that leads to unsuccessful sieve plates [39]. This concept is supported by the use of labeled 14CO2, having reduced rate of f low of transport, when transported through the sieve tube system in the mutant CALS [1].\nAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY Vol. 67 No. 5 2020"

      "text" : "To finalize the shape and size of organ of plant, there is requirement of coordination among distinct cell layers facilitated by mean of plasmodesmal continuation [40]. ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3) is an important transcriptional co-activator, transmitted from inner mesophyll cells to the outer epidermal cells in Arabidopsis to facilitates the expansion of leaf primordia along with reduced cell proliferation. In order to uncover the importance of transmission, an3 mutant plays an important role as it shows aberration in both leaf size and its epidermal cells proliferation [40, 41]. Intercellular movement of some transcriptional factors in both directions constitutes a feedback loop through the intercellular continuation as explained in Arabidopsis for hair cell and trichome pattering [42]. During root hair patterning, a complex of WEREWOLF (WER), GLABRA3 (GL3), ENHANDER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3) and TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1) synthesized in the non root hair cell and is transmitted through plasmodesmata in order to generate root hair cell. Such complex allows the expression of a negative regulator GL2 (GLABRA2) and positive regulator CARPRICE (CPC) [34]. Non hair cell fate is\nRUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY Vol. 67\ndetermined by the GL2, whereas the CPC removes the WER from the complex in the relative hair cell [43] and by inhibiting the GL2 expression leads to determine the root hair cell fate, as summarized in Table 1.\nAdditionally, a feedback loop is established as CPC generated complex that induces the expression of GL3 EGL3 that transmitted to non hair cells. ETC2/3(ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC2/3), a homologue of CPC along with the TTG1 was also observed to be transmitted from cell to adjacent cells [62]. In leaf mesophyll, the cells maintain continuous f low passively by plasmodesmatal channels symplastically. However, the plasmodesmal number is altered in different regions of leaves and certainly reduced in adjoining wall of vascular tissues. The apoptosis in xylem elements and stomata covering guard cell maintains specificity in plasmodesmata and gets modified to cope functionally with the need of tissue as the symplastic connection lost on maturity until the cell died. The growth factors, amino acids, metabolites, movement proteins, chemical compounds and ions are passed through the plasmodesmata without affecting the basal cytoplasmic structure of SEL [63]. The variation in SEL can be regulated in an endogenous manner within cell-cell, tissues and organ level.\nNo. 5 2020"

In case of Arabidopsis, SAM gives off the inflorescence meristem, and such progression is induced by FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) belonging to CENTRORADIALIS TERMINAL FLOWER 1 SELFPRUNING (CETS) gene family [46]. However, in case of rice, squash and tomato such transition occurs by their protein orthologue HEADING DATE 3 (HDA3), FT-LIKE 2 (FTL2) and SINGEL FLOWER TRUSS (SFT) respectively [69, 70]. Phloem sieve element carries the FT, loaded in the leaves and transferred cell to cell similar to the SAM. To remain in an indefinite state of SAM, TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1) of Arabidopsis and its tomato orthologue SELFPRUNING translocate through plasmodesmata between adjacent cells. Correspondence proportion of the FT and TFL1/SELFPRUNING determines the inflorescence meristem from the shoot apical meristem [51]. Protein TFL1 negatively regulates the LFY&APETALA1 (AP1) when transmitted to the outer epidermal layer during maturation of the inflorescence meristem. Moreover, in the outer cells, LFY complexes with TFL1 protein, allow its transmission to generate a feedback loop. So far the valuable role of LFY protein is not clear as it also travels among cells through plasmodesmata [71]. However, it is concluded that LFY protein may act to finalize the overall transition of meristem into f lower as a safe-guard mechanism. Other transcriptional factors such as MADS box domain AGAMOUS (AG), APETALA3 (AP3), PISTILLATA (PI) &SEPELLATA3 (SEP3) are transmitted through plasmodesmata, which are the primary regulators of f loral organ identity [54], as summarized in Table 1. In Populus, dormancy and flowering regulated by environmental factors such as vernalization and photoperiod involve plasmodesmatal opening as well as movement of FLOWERING LOCUS in shoot apex. In rice leaves, the overexpression of plasmodesmata associated genes causes reduction in inflorescence attributed traits [72, 73]. Thus, plasmodesmata are the critical candidates for particular orthologous gene regulation to facilitate the required macromolecular transport for development."

Tapetal cells are interconnected by plasmodesmatal connection for exchange of materials. Callose material required for pollen tetrad cell wall formation is facilitated by plasmodesmata when pollen mother cell undergoes meiotic cell division [75]. Once the meiosis gets accomplished, tapetal cells lose their plasmodesmatal connection to protect surrounding cells for preventing transfer of apoptotic chemicals required for cell death of tapetal cells. The degrading tapetal cell mobilized to area of pollen development to nourish it [76]. Programmed cell death mechanism is supported by observation in rice plant when their pollen grains are degenerated or remained unnourished [77]. Channels larger than the usual plasmodesmata pores are known as cytomictic channels present between tapetal cells. Cytoplasmic organelles and chromatin are transferred through these channels and their functions are not well cleared, possibly determined the timing of meiotic division [78]."

With the maturation of ovule at the stage 12 of anthesis (f loral bud developmental stage), the cytoplasmic continuum becomes discontinuous, due to uncertain reasons but when it proceeds to stage 13 of anthesis (developmental stage where anther dehiscence occurs), the continuity from vasculature is re-established.

      "text" : "Primary root and lateral root generally constitute the root system in plants. Primary roots are synthesized during embryogenesis while lateral roots are synthesized from primary root after embryogenesis. The initiation of stem cell region leads to provide new initial and daughter cells that differentiate to their respective parts of root [59]. As a result of predominately occurring transverse division in root, there is formation of primary plasmodesmata in transverse walls and secondary plasmodesmata on the rest of the wall. As the number of primary plasmodesmata on the transverse wall enhanced, it makes sense that there is an increased transport of material [81]. This transportable material provides developmental and positional cues for the developing root cells. The root meristem of Arabidopsis plasmodesmata facilitates the transcriptional factor, snRNA species responsible for fate of endodermal cells, pericycle and xylem component such as proto- or metaxylem [82]. Fate of endodermis layer is determined by complex of SHR-SCR (SHOOT ROOT-SCARECROW) transcriptional factors that induce specific endodermis genes [83]. The transcriptional factor SHR belonging to GRAS family moves toward the cortex tissue from developing stele through plasmodesmata while SCR from cortex tissue. In addition to endodermis specific genes expression, miR165/166 genes also cause silencing of various transcriptional factors such as PHB, PHV (PHAVOLUTA), REV/IFL1 (REVOLUTA/INTERFASCICULARIS FIBERLESS 1), as summarized in Table 1. The miRNA targets the HD-ZIP III proteins to regulate the xylem (either proto or meta) in a concentration dependent manner when it moves toward centre and generates a concentration difference [84]. There is generation of protoxylem if it has low dose of this protein and metaxylem if it has high dose [22, 85]. Plasmodesmata allow these two major components of molecular system to establish a constant change in concentration in bidirectional manner either from center to external side or from external to internal. PHB with the respective concentration of low, medium and high in the developing tissue regulates the fate of pericycle cells, protoxylem and metaxylem. This PHB level is determined by the concentration gradient of miRNA 165/6 in a manner that if it is at peak, then PHB expresses at a minimum amount and vice versa [22, 85]. Some of the important non-autonomous molecular components are summarized in Fig. 2."

Plant growth gets further enhanced by the lateral root emergence and its extension as it promotes the functional capacity of root [86]. Role of plasmodesmata in the lateral root formation from the xylem pole pericycle cells has been reported in Arabidopsis. Unloading of carboxyfluorescein dye from the phloem into the adjacent pericycle cells has been shown to be restricted in the old roots which were previously continuous in the young growing roots [87]. There was symplastic isolation of lateral root primordia in the late stages of root growth [88]. The disconnected phloem unloading from the already emerged older primordia occurs only if it gets a new vascular supply. The role in plasmodesmatal regulation is followed by the callose and the concept is supported by the enzymes β-1,3-glucanases. Mutants having over expression in callose synthesis confirm the role of plasmodesmata in the determination of positional pattern of lateral roots during the initial stages. It is suggested that subsequent appearance of new lateral roots seems to be occur with the cytoplasmic isolation from the surrounding tissue because of callose deposition [89].

Plasmodesmata-related proteins including PDBGs and PDCBs, are involved in callose homeostasis at the PD zone to regulate plasmodesmata permeability. Hence more work is needed on these proteins that how they are signalled and their levels are regulated. The vital role of plasmodesmata for cell-to-cell transport in plants has been already well studied, but understanding of changing the structural patterning, regulation of its permeability and activity acts as an integrated approach toward advancing the knowledge regarding plasmodesmata. However, the removal of these specific channels or lack in their activity is not known yet but it provides a cushion for researchers to create a major outbreak in the research of modern plant physiology in future."
