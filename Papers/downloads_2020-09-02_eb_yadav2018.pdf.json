      "text" : "The development of new materials has brought about a change in the world since the era of bronze and iron. The evolution of stainless steel, concrete, and silicon redefined new boundaries and made modern era possible. It would not be a hyperbole if the present age is termed as the age of nanomaterials. Nanomaterials can be categorized in various types based on their shape and structure such as 0D (quantum dots (QDs)), 1D (nanorods, nanotubes), 2D (nanosheets), and 3D (flower like, cubical etc.).\nMolybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a typical layered 2D transition metal dichalcogenide, has received colossal interest in the past few years due to its unique structural, physicochemical, optical, and biological properties. While MoS2 is mostly applied in traditional industries such as dry lubricants, intercalation agents, and negative electrode material in lithium-ion batteries, its 2D and 0D forms have led to diverse applications in sensing, catalysis, therapy, and imaging. Herein, a systematic overview of the progress that is made in the field of MoS2 research with an emphasis on its different biomedical applications is presented. This article provides a general discussion on the basic structure and property of MoS2 and gives a detailed description of its different morphologies that are synthesized so far, namely, nanosheets, nanotubes, and quantum dots along with synthesis strategies. The biomedical applications of MoS2-based nanocomposites are also described in detail and categorically, such as in varied therapeutic and diagnostic modalities like drug delivery, gene delivery, phototherapy, combined therapy, bioimaging, theranostics, and biosensing. Finally, a brief commentary on the current challenges and limitations being faced is provided, along with a discussion of some future perspectives for the overall improvement of MoS2-based nanocomposites as a potential nanomedicine.\n2D MoS2-Based Nanomaterials\nThe property which makes nanomaterials much more interesting and unique is their distinctiveness from their bulk counter parts. The properties of nanomaterials not only depend on their composition but also depend on their shape and size. In recent decade, huge interest has emerged in a new class of materials, typically known as 2D material, which consist of single layer of atoms held together by Van der Waals forces.[1–3] A wide variety of 2D materials, such as graphene (carbon), borophene (boron), germanene (germanium), silicene (silicon), stanene (tin), and many more have been explored and studied for different applications in electronics, catalysis, energy, and biomedical technology to name a few.[1] Graphene, the first known 2D material, attracted tremendous interest due to its exceptional mechanical, electrical, and optical properties.[4–9] Graphene and its composite have been successfully used in sensors, energy devices, catalysis, electronics, and nanomedicine.[10–18] However, the inherent shortcomings, such as\nintrinsic defects, chemical inertness, and zero bandgap have led to the search and development of better alternatives.\nTransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as potential alternate to graphene owing to their intriguing properties, such as high conductivity, excellent catalytic properties, high charge-density-wave transition, and good biocompatibility.[19–21] TMDs are class of 2D materials having X-M-X layered structure where M (Mo, W, V, Ti, etc.) is the transition metal and X is a chalcogenide (S, Se, or Te). Within a single layer, the atoms X-M-X are covalently bonded whereas the different layers are bound together by weak Van der Waals forces. The crystal structure depends on the coordination of metal atom with chalcogenide and the layer arrangement and their properties vary with variation in their crystal structure.\nTMDs have attracted huge attention due to their desirable chemical, electrical, and optical properties.[22–25] TMD monolayer crystal does not have a center of inversion and thus exhibit distinctly different properties from their bulk counterparts.[26,27] This allowed access to a new degree of freedom, namely, the k-valley index and opened up a new field of physics called valleytronics.[28,29] TMDs have a strong spin–orbit coupling which leads to spin–orbit splitting and hence removal of degeneracy in both conduction as well as valence band.[30] The monolayers have high binding energy due to the better coulombic interaction between an electron and hole as compared to bulk.[31–34]\nSmall 2019, 15, 1803706\n1803706 (2 of 33)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\nwww.small-journal.com\nAmong all known TMDs, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has gained special interest because of its extraordinary optoelectronic, catalytic, energy harvesting, and biological properties.[22,35] MoS2 is structurally and electrically analogous to graphene and can be exfoliated from bulk MoS2.[23] Moreover, MoS2 can also be synthesized with controlled and desired morphologies such as nanosheets, quantum dots, radar-like particles, flower-like particles, and nanotubes which can be utilized for various applications.[36–40] Interestingly, bulk MoS2 has an indirect bandgap (1.2 eV) while the exfoliated MoS2 exhibits direct bandgap (1.8 eV) and thus shows absorption and photoluminescence properties.[41–44] Therefore, with all these unique structural, optical, and physicochemical characteristics, MoS2 have found vast application in the fields of catalysis, energy, electronics, and biomedical areas in the past few years.[45–50]\nOver the years, research in the synthesis of new kind of nanomaterials and their subsequent biofunctionalization have brought enormous progress in the development of strategies for early diagnosis and efficient cancer therapy.[51,52] Chemotherapy has been the most commonly accepted approach to treat cancer which has proved effective up to some extent. However, the chemotherapeutic agents that are routinely being used have been found to show low cellular uptake efficiency, insufficient water solubility, nonspecific delivery, and their long-term use have also led to the induction of multidrug resistance among different forms of cancer and many other side effects.[53,54] To overcome these side effects, certain drug delivery systems (DDSs) have been developed.[55,56] The newly designed DDSs or nanocarriers have gained significant interest because of (1) their ability to enter cells efficiently to deliver the therapeutic cargo owing to their nanosize, (2) high surface-area-to-volume ratio that provides high drug loading capacity, and (3) the possibility to synthesize nanocarriers with multiple functionalities for theranostic applications.[57–60]\nAmong the class of 2D materials that are currently being explored for biomedical applications, MoS2 is playing a significant role as a theranostic agent. However, till date only a single review focusing on the synthesis and biomedical applications of MoS2 has been published.[61] The current review aims to provide a detailed categorical description of the different synthesis strategies that are specific for the development of different morphologies of MoS2-based nanomaterials and also categorize the different biomedical applications under separate sections based on their therapeutic, diagnostic, sensing, or synergistic modalities, namely, drug delivery, gene delivery, phototherapy (photothermal/photodynamic), combined therapy, diagnostic bioimaging, theranostics, and biosensing (Scheme 1), with the ultimate objective of providing the readers with a better understanding of the tremendous potential that this 2D material holds as a nanomedicine."

Crystals of MoS2 are composed of S-Mo-S layers, held together by weak Van der Waals forces and is about 6.5 Å thick.[27,49] MoS2 unit cell has honeycomb-like structure where each Mo atom is encircled by six S atoms. This kind of structure provides 2D penetrable channels for electron transport whereas electron jump in vertical direction is hindered by interlayer potential difference.[27,49,62] As a result, the conductivity within a plane is higher than that of adjacent layers.[63] Thus, decreasing the number of layers helps in improving the conductivity and facilitates fast electron transport.\nPrevious studies on crystal structure of MoS2 revealed that there exist three fundamental types of MoS2 based on coordination of S atoms with Mo atom and assembling order of each layer. The three polytypes known so far are 2H-MoS2, 1T-MoS2, and 3R-MoS2, where 1, 2, and 3 denote the number of layers and H, T, and R illustrate the distinct crystal structures\nspecifically hexagonal (H), trigonal (T), and rhombohedral (R), respectively (Figure 1b). Among these three, 2H and 3R are stable and found in nature. 2H-MoS2, the most abundant polytype, has many applications due to its plenitude in earth’s crust.[64,65] 2H and 3R-MoS2 have trigonal prismatic coordination, while 1T-MoS2 possesses octahedral coordination of Mo atoms. The different arrangement of layers creates the structural difference between 2H and 3R-MoS2. Moreover, both 2H and 3R-MoS2 possess very indistinguishable properties, such as diamagnetic nature and are n-type semiconductor, except for the small difference in band structure. On contrary, 1T-MoS2 is paramagnetic and metallic in nature.[66] 3R and 1T-MoS2 can be easily transformed into 2H polytype, for example, 3R-MoS2 can be recast into the 2H form upon heating while 1T-MoS2 can be converted to 2H by annealing, applying strain and electron doping.[67–69] Moreover, MoS2 has some structural defects which includes point defects, grain boundaries, and edges. These defects provide the feasibility of surface alteration and functionalization which further influence their chemical, electrical, and optical properties.[70] Unlike graphene, MoS2 nanosheets have a wrinkle-free morphology and are much smoother.\nMoS2 has made a palpable presence among the layered materials for various applications because of its unique properties like direct intrinsic bandgap, high mobility, suitable optical properties, and many others. Also, the different morphologies of MoS2 show different behavior like variation of bandgap, stability, optical properties, etc. In the following sections, we discuss the properties related to different morphologies of MoS2 known so far."

Correspondingly, photoluminescence (PL) from MoS2 increases with decrease in thickness of layer.[72] Figure 2b shows dramatic increase in PL efficiency as thickness decreases from bulk to monolayer. The Raman spectrum of MoS2 exhibits two bands, E12g and A1g, whose position, intensity, and width are different for different thickness of ultrathin MoS2 wafers.[73] From Figure 2c it is concluded that frequency of A1g band is increasing while that of E12g is decreasing with increase in number of layers. Besides, MoS2 is mechanically flexible and have a Young’s modulus value of 0.33 ± 0.07 TPa."

This results in the decrease in the number of overlapping orbitals or energy level and an increase in the energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band. Also bonding between the Mo atoms in QDs was found to be much sturdy than mono layer sheet.[75] Loh et al. reported the impact of quantum mechanical effect on the geometry (i.e., energy of formation) and the electronic features (charge density, spin density, etc.) when MoS2 nanosheets were converted into QDs.[76] One basic characteristic that is enhanced drastically because of their size variation is their optical properties. Their optical properties can easily be tuned by changing their size, that is, different size means different bandgap which leads to different absorption and emission frequencies of light and ultimately different colors. Lin et al. reported excitation and size-dependent photoluminescence property of MoS2 QDs.[77] The synthesis, properties, and applications of MoS2 QDs have been discussed in a detailed review Arul and Nithya.[78]"

Indeed, MoS2 nanotubes were first fabricated and characterized by Tenne and co-workers.[82] They achieved very thin walls, which can even break under short ultrasound perturbation. Tubular structures are created by rolling the nanosheets into a cylindrical shape along a specified direction. MoS2 nanotubes are semiconductors having smaller bandgap than that of bulk MoS2. The MoS2 nanotubes have slightly larger bond lengths than those of nanosheets. The band structure of MoS2 nanotubes is similar to that of carbon nanotubes except that there is an increase in bandgap of MoS2 nanotubes as the diameter of nanotubes increases. Nanotubes are further exploited for the synthesis of a new hybrid material, called nanopods.[83]"

      "text" : "A wide range of strategies have been developed for the synthesis of MoS2 nanomaterials belonging to different dimensions such as nanodots/quantum dots (0D), nanotubes (1D), nanosheets/nanoflakes (2D), and nanocomposites. These strategies can be broadly categorized into two main approaches, namely, top-down approach and bottom-up approach. The topdown approach, also known as stepwise design, is the process of breakdown of bulk material into its compositional subsystems. This approach involves all those processes which include decomposition or exfoliation of bulk MoS2 into its nanoscale range either through the application of physical/mechanical force or by the use of solvents and chemicals for intercalation and exfoliation. Examples of top-down approach for synthesis of MoS2 nanomaterials are mechanical exfoliation, liquid/ solvent-assisted exfoliation, chemical assisted exfoliation and intercalation, and electrochemical exfoliation. In contrast, the bottom-up approach involves assembling of compositional subsystems to give rise to a complex counterpart. This approach includes processes such as hydrothermal/solvothermal reaction and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), where the synthesis of nanomaterial takes place directly from precursors. In addition to these top-down and bottom-up approaches, several other methods of synthesis have also been developed for preparing MoS2 nanosheets, thin films, quantum dots, and nanotubes that include wet-chemistry approach, thermal anisotropy (sputtering), physical vapor deposition, vapor-solid growth, thermal decomposition, and electron–Fenton reaction. However, all the above-mentioned methods have their own advantages and drawbacks, and the choice for selecting a method of preparation mainly depends on the application for which it is going to be used. For example, it has been observed that synthesis methods that are safe, easy to perform, cost-effective, and produce smaller-sized nanoparticles are more favorable and applicable for biomedical applications where size and toxicity of the synthesized nanomaterials determine the efficiency of the particular application. So, processes like liquid/solventassisted exfoliation, chemical-assisted exfoliation and intercalation, and most importantly hydrothermal/solvothermal methods of preparation have emerged as the methods of choice for preparing MoS2 nanostructures of smaller size and better biocompatibility, especially for biomedical applications. The\nfollowing section discusses the different preparation methods as mentioned above for the synthesis of various morphologies of MoS2-based nanomaterials.

This approach was first used by Novoselov et al. to produce atomically thin carbon film using simple scotch tape.[9] Subsequently, this effective exfoliation approach was also utilized on a number of layered materials including MoS2.[84] This method has been used frequently to produce 2D monolayers of MoS2 for utilization in various electrical devices such as phototransistors, integrated circuits and logic operations, and transistors as it produces excellent quality MoS2 nanosheets having no defects or vacancies.[49,85] Mechanically exfoliated nanosheets exhibit some unique properties such as exceptional lattice vibrations, photoluminescence, frictional features, hysteresis, and different electronic states.[86–90] Despite the method being convenient, cheap, and able to produce excellent quality of MoS2 nanosheets, but still it has some limitations, such as poor thickness control and low yield. However, laser thinning, shear force, and other methods that are also used for mechanical exfoliation have shown to control the thickness locally (Figure 4a,b).[93–95] But for practical applications in industries, large-scale production is required and as for now mechanical exfoliation method is far from reality. Similarly, this method is also not suitable for producing sheets that are to be used in biomedical applications, as mechanically exfoliated nanosheets are usually much larger in size and are insoluble in water."

The solvent molecules help in weakening the interactions between the layers of the material in its bulk form, which leads to the separation/exfoliation into individual layers upon ultrasonication. Ultrasonication also helps in breaking down the layers into smaller sheets of nanoscale range. The chemically exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets have been used as photothermal agents and drug carriers which depicts their low cytotoxicity and high biocompatibility.[96–98] Smith et al. synthesized thin flakes of MoS2 by sonicating the powder in ionic surfactant solution of sodium cholate.[99] Although surfactant stabilizes the flakes, but it also hindered the conductivity of MoS2 and hence restricted its applications in field of electronics and energy. Later, a direct liquid exfoliation was demonstrated by same group using certain solvents, such as N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP), isopropanol, and dimethylformamide (DMF).[41] Further, Cunningham et al. demonstrated the exfoliation of TMDs including MoS2 in different\nSmall 2019, 15, 1803706\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\nwww.small-journal.com\n1803706 (7 of 33)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

O’Neill et al. further investigated the effect of operating parameters on dissipation into NMP.[101] Later, a mixed solvent approach was used by Zhou et al. for liquid exfoliation of MoS2.[102] In addition to ionic surfactants and organic solvents, water has also been used as a solvent for the exfoliation of bulk MoS2 into monolayers using a mixed mechanical-liquid exfoliation method.[103] The exfoliated nanosheets were found to be highly dispersible in water showing high stability. Although the yield of the exfoliated sheets was half of that achieved using organic solvents, but the process can be of significant importance for producing sheets especially for biomedical purposes because of the chemicalfree nature of the exfoliation process. Moreover, there are a few other techniques used for exfoliation, such as sonication combined with low-energy ball mining and grinding.[104,105] Though these methods are effective in producing large quantity of exfoliated material, yet single-layer high-quality MoS2 monolayers are difficult to obtain."

The toxicity of the nanosheets produced by this method is a serious concern due to the toxic nature of lithium compounds that tend to remain attached with the exfoliated sheets even after washing.[108] So, apart from lithium, small molecules such as NH3/NH4+ having less toxicity have also been explored as intercalating agents for exfoliation of MoS2.[109]"

Similarly, electrochemical intercalation of sodium ions into bulk layers of MoS2 has also been carried out to produce exfoliated sheets upon ultrasonication.[112] Further detailed and thorough study of this method was carried out by Liu et al.[92] Here, largearea and atomically thin MoS2 nanosheets were prepared by adapting interlayer gas bubbling. Figure 4c shows exfoliation of bulk MoS2 by bubbles formed from electrolysis of water. The lateral size of as-obtained sheets can reach up to 50 µm.

It has been proved efficient by various research groups in producing largescale, premium quality, continuous nanosheets with constant thickness.[114–116] The nanosheets produced by CVD have grain boundaries and ripples which make them an interesting element of study. Also, this technique has a suitable control over crystal morphology, that is, different morphologies can be produced using this method.[117,118] By CVD approach, large-area 2D MoS2 nanosheets can be grown on top of a solid substrate using common precursors such as Mo, MoO3, MoO2, Mo(CO)6, and MoCl5.[119–122] Lee et al. have produced large-area MoS2 monolayers on SiO2 substrate by CVD method using MoO3 and S powder as precursors.[123] The growth of MoS2 layers was promoted due to treatment of substrate with graphene-like molecules, such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO), pery lene3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid tetrapotassium salt (PTAS), etc. The role of various organic as well as inorganic molecules as seeding promoters was also investigated by Lee et al.[124] The researchers observed that when organic molecules were used as seeding promoters, growth of continuous monolayer films, or triangular flakes of MoS2 occurred on the substrates, whereas use of inorganic molecules resulted either in no growth of MoS2 or formation of only MoS2 particles, thereby highlighting the importance of proper selection of seeding promoters for uniform growth of MoS2 monolayers.

During the process, a high vapor pressure is self-developed and it increases with increase in temperature.[125,126] MoS2 nanosheets were produced solvothermally by taking molybdenum oxide and KSCN (or Na2S, CH3CSNH2, NH2CSNH2) in deionized water.[127] The sheets were produced at low temperature which prevented the release of toxic gases. MoS2 nanosheets having different morphologies were also produced solvothermally by treating (NH4)2 MoS4 in a mixture of DMF and H2O at 210 °C for 18 h.[128] Later, MoS2 nanosheets of several hundred nanometers in size with proper optimization were produced by Ye et al. using hydrothermal approach.[129] A one-pot hydrothermal synthesis of PEGylated MoS2 nanosheets was reported by Wang et al. using (NH4)2 MoS4 as the precursor and PEG-400 aqueous solution as the solvent.[130] The main disadvantage with this method is uncontrolled number of layers and high temperature and pressure requirements during synthesis. However, the PEGylated MoS2 nanosheets were found to be highly stable and showed excellent biocompatibility."

A new wet chemistry technique was\nintroduced by Altavilla et al. for synthesis of freestanding MoS2 nanosheets.[131] The technique is based on decomposition of the precursor into its components in presence of oleylamine at low temperature. The reactant (ammonium tetrathiomolybdate) in olelyamine was stirred under N2 flow at 100 °C for 15 min and then temperature was increased gradually to 360 °C for 90 min. It was then cooled to room temperature and product was collected. Recently, MoS2 nanosheets with uniform thickness and large area having strong basal plane (002) or edge plane (100) inclination were prepared via sputter deposition.[132] The same group further investigated large-scale few-layered MoS2 growth at low temperature by physical vapor deposition.[133] Vapor-solid growth technique, that is, evaporating MoS2 powder on solid substrate was also reported for the synthesis of MoS2 sheets.[134] Molybdenum and sulfur have also been evaporated on surface of metals for growth of MoS2 nanosheets in a scanning tunneling microscope chamber.[135,136] However, the products obtained were nanoclusters rather than nanosheets."

      "text" : "PTT involves the use of a phototransducer material that can efficiently absorb and convert light energy, especially nearinfrared (NIR) light, into heat, which is then utilized for inducing localized thermal ablation of targeted cells or tissues, mostly cancerous. The excellent biologically favorable properties of NIR such as deep tissue penetration, minimal absorbance by cells/tissues, water molecules, proteins, and other body fluids combined with its noninvasive nature have made PTT a therapeutic modality of choice for treating a variety of tumor. The phototransducer materials that have been widely explored for PTT include organic NIR-responsive dyes and nanomaterials. Among the class of nanomaterials, plasmonic metal nanoparticles of different morphologies and 2D nanomaterials such as graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide have attracted the majority of attention for PTT because of their excellent tunable photothermal conversion efficiency. In addition to these nanomaterials, MoS2 has recently emerged as a new class of biocompatible nanomaterial having high light-to-heat conversion efficiency. Several studies have explored the photothermal properties of MoS2 and demonstrated its therapeutic efficiency for treating different types of cancer, either alone or in combination with other treatment modalities. This section discusses the applications of different MoS2-based nanocomposites in photothermal treatment of cancer.\nChou et al. demonstrated the NIR-responsive photothermal property of chemically exfoliated MoS2 (ce-MoS2) nanosheets in vitro.[97] HeLa cells incubated with different concentrations of ce-MoS2 and irradiated with a 800 nm laser showed significant cell death. Cells incubated with ce-MoS2 at the same concentrations but without NIR irradiation did not show any toxicity, thereby establishing the biocompatibility of the nanosheets. In another study, a new “bottom-up” approach of one-pot solvothermal synthesis of PEGylated MoS2 nanosheets was reported by Wang et al. using ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, thiourea, and PEG as precursors.[165] This process resulted in the synthesis of MoS2 nanosheets of controlled size, increased crystallinity, and excellent colloidal stability. The synthesized MoS2-PEG nanosheets showed highly efficient in vitro and in vivo photothermal ablation of cancer cells without any observable hemolysis, coagulation, and toxicity. Feng et al. developed PEGylated flower-like MoS2 particles for NIR photothermal therapy.[160] The flower-like structures were synthesized using a facile hydrothermal approach and were further functionalized using LA-PEG which resulted in enhancement of colloidal stability and reduction of cytotoxicity. The photothermal activity of MoS2-PEG nanoflowers was demonstrated in 4T1 cells. The as-obtained MoS2-PEG nanoflowers exhibited good photothermal stability, low cytotoxicity, high hemocompatibility, capability of generating higher temperature, and a photo thermal conversion efficiency of 27.6%. It was also reported that the nanoflowers could induce efficient killing of cancer cells by photothermal therapy including damage to the integrity of lysosomal membrane and cell skeleton. Huang et al. reported the synthesis MoS2 radar-like nanoparticles (MoS2 RNPs) for NIR photothermal therapy.[37] The nanoparticles exhibited good photo thermal conversion\nSmall 2019, 15, 1803706\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\nwww.small-journal.com\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\nwww.small-journal.com\nefficiency (PCE), as high as 53.3% which is higher than other morphologies such as MoS2 nanoflakes (27.6%), and MoS2 nanosheets (24.4%). The PCE of some other morphologies such as MoS2 INPs (23.1%), MoS2 nanoflowers (18.2%), and MoS2 microspheres (15.2%) were also found to be lesser than radar-like particles. The results revealed that radar-like particles not only exhibited better PCE than other morphologies but also high photostability and biocompatibility. The PTT performance was evaluated by injecting 4T1 tumor-bearing mice with MoS2 RNPs and irradiating it with 808 nm laser. Results showed that tumor cells were destroyed efficiently both in vivo and in vitro. In a recent study by Chen et al., MoS2 nanoflakes were synthesized by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method along with suitable degradation capability (Figure 6a).[166] Degradation profile gives information about the pharmacokinetics and clearance of the nanoparticles from the body. Better the degradation profile of the nanocomposites into more smaller particles, easier will be the clearance and lesser will be the accumulation of the nanocomposites in different organs. Hybrid MoS2 nanoflakes (MoS2-PPEG) functionalized with PAA and PEG were synthesized by hydrothermal process that showed excellent colloidal stability, pH specific degradability, biocompatibility, and NIR-responsive photothermal killing of cancer cells and tumor growth suppression both in vitro and in vivo (Figure 6b–d). An inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) study revealed that at pH 7.4, around 80% of the MoS2-PPEG nanoflakes were degraded into Mo content within 3 d. On the other hand, at pH 5 only 48% degradation was observed in 3 d thereby showing the slower degradation profile of the nanoflakes in tumor microenvironment which is beneficial for therapy. In response to NIR irradiation, the MoS2-PPEG nanocomposites showed more than 80% reduction in viability of 4T1 breast cancer cells in vitro and caused tumor size regression in 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice within 2 d of treatment without any recurrence even after 13 d. As an alternative to standard PEGylation technique, proteins and phospholipids have also been explored as novel surface functionalizing agents for improving the physiological stability and biocompatibility of MoS2 nanosheets. One such example is the synthesis of a protein/inorganic hybrid nanocomposite comprising of MoS2 nanosheets decorated with regenerated silk fibroin (RSF) by a simple process that involved direct self-assembly of silk protein on the surface of MoS2 flakes.[167] Silk fibroin has emerged as a biocompatible, biodegradable, low-cost natural material having minimal in vivo inflammatory response. Owing to these properties, silk fibroin was used to functionalize MoS2 nanosheets to improve its stability in aqueous solutions. The synthesized RSF/MoS2 hybrids showed good biocompatibility and were successful in inducing photothermal ablation of HeLa cells in vitro in response to NIR irradiation. Similarly, soybean phospholipid encapsulated MoS2 nanosheets (SP-MoS2) were synthesized by Li et al. by simply vacuum-treating a dispersion of\n1803706 (14 of 33)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

SP-MoS2 nanosheets showed high colloidal stability, excellent biocompatibility, and good photothermal conversion efficiency. In in vitro studies, SP-MoS2 nanosheets demonstrated dose-dependent decrease in viability of 4T1 cells in response to NIR laser irradiation. Similarly, in vivo results showed the potential of these nanocomposites to successfully induce photothermal ablation of B16 tumors in BALB/c nude mice. In another recent work, Huang et al. reported the synthesis of multihydroxy hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG) functionalized MoS2 nanosheets using the process of surface-initiated ring-opening polymerization and demonstrated excellent NIR-responsive photothermal behavior.[169] The HPG grafted MoS2 nanohybrids showed excellent water dispersibility, good biocompatibility, and greatly enhanced colloidal stability. Grafting of HPG significantly improved the colloidal stability of the nanocomposites against variations in pH and ionic strength, and also maintained high stability in long-term storage. The presence of numerous hydroxyl groups on the HPG grafted MoS2 nanosheets provided easy functionalization with fluorescent dye such as Rhodamine B, thereby making this nanocomposite a potential multifunctional candidate for future applications in cancer therapy."

Liu et al. developed LA-PEG functionalized MoS2 nanosheets for combined chemo-photothermal therapy of cancer.[172] The functionalization was done by simply mixing the MoS2 nanosheets, synthesized using liquid exfoliation method, with LA-PEG under sonication at room temperature. The rationale behind using lipoic acid was to increase the PEG-MoS2 binding whereas the PEG enhanced the physiological stability of MoS2 nanosheets. Different drugs, with different concentrations and at different pH, including DOX and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38), were loaded to investigate the drug loading capacity of PEGylated MoS2 nanosheets. It was observed that drug loading capacity of PEGylated MoS2 nanosheets was much more than PEGylated graphene. The sheets were found to have no cytotoxic effect on the cells. Further, folic acid (FA) conjugated PEG-MoS2 were fabricated for targeted drug delivery (DOX). The results obtained from both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that FA-PEG-MoS2/DOX in presence of NIR irradiation exhibited 95% cell death which was significantly higher than that of chemotherapy (≈50%) or photothermal therapy (≈50%) alone, thereby demonstrating highly efficient synergistic photo thermal and chemotherapy for successful inhibition of tumor growth. Recently, Wang et al., for the first time, fabricated a phase-changing organic–inorganic composite for treating tumor.[130] They homogenized poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), an organic biocompatible polymer extensively used in biomedical applications, MoS2 and DOX in NMP to\nSmall 2019, 15, 1803706\n1803706 (16 of 33)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

PLGA is hydrophobic in nature and hence undergoes liquid–solid phase transformation as soon as it comes in contact with body fluids and envelopes MoS2 nanosheets and DOX forming a high potential implant for synergistic tumor chemophoto therapy. Upon NIR irradiation, the heat produced triggered rapid release of encapsulated DOX molecules from the implant and caused significant tumor ablation. It was reported that the 4T1 breast tumors in mice could be completely removed without any reoccurrence. In addition to this, there were no side effects on normal tissues and organs. Other than antitumor drug (DOX), an antibiotic drug amoxicillin (AMX) was also incorporated successfully into the implant, thereby further highlighting the potential this drug loading strategy beholds.

The nanoparticles also exhibited dual stimulus (pH and NIR) responsive drug release and highly efficient synergistic chemophotothermal killing of tumors, both in vitro and in vivo.\nA NIR-light-triggered drug-delivery system was synthesized by Shao et al.[175] where periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) loaded with DOX were wrapped with MoS2 nanosheets and then functionalized with PEG to form a PMO-DOX@ MoS2-PEG nanoplatform. The synthesized PMO-DOX@ MoS2-PEG nanoplatforms showed high DOX loading capacity (160 µg mg−1 PMOs), monodispersity, excellent photothermal transformation ability, and good stability in physiological conditions. The entrapped DOX was released from the nanoplatforms via the photothermal effect of MoS2 nanosheets under NIR laser irradiation. The researchers demonstrated synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy of liver and breast cancer cells. The results showed that synergistic therapeutic strategy was more efficient in reducing cell viability of cancer cells (13% for liver cancer and 15% for breast cancer) as compared to single photothermal therapy (74% for liver cancer and 65% for breast cancer) or chemotherapy (59% for liver cancer and 49% for breast cancer). In another study, single-layer MoS2 nanoplates coated with porous silica and modified with PEG were reported by Lee et al.[176] The idea behind the fabrication was taken from the development of silica-coated graphene oxide system. Silica and PEG contributed in the improvement of colloidal stability and maintenance of single-layer structure of MoS2. DOX was loaded into silica structure and was released by exposing to NIR irradiation at acidic pH. The system was found to be biocompatible and no cytotoxicity was observed for HeLa, MCF-7, HepG2, and HCT-8 cells. MoS2(DOX-PSMS-PEG) nanosheets demonstrated better therapeutic effect for the treatment of liver and colon cancer than free DOX, that is, 30 times more effective than free DOX. This was attributed to combined effects of hyperthermia induced photothermal therapy and chemotherapy along with successful endosomal escape. A different kind of structure was reported by Su et al. where a sandwich-like nanocomposite was developed by directly growing mesoporous organosilicas (MOS) on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as structure directing agent.[177] The synthesized MoS2/MOS nanocomposites showed high surface area, large pore volume, excellent biocompatibility, high photothermal transducing behavior, and photothermally triggered controlled drug release, thereby making it a suitable platform for chemo-photothermal applications. Zhao et al. reported the synthesis of a stimuliresponsive targeted drug delivery system consisting of hollow mesoporous silica nanospheres loaded with DOX and capped with MoS2 nanosheets via disulfide bonds, thereby making it responsive to intracellular reducing environments such as high glutathione (GSH) concentrations.[178] This was followed by surface functionalization with transferrin protein to confer it targeting ability. The MoS2 sheets functioned both as a gatekeeper to prevent unwanted release of DOX from the system and as a photothermal transducer because of its high NIR\nabsorption ability. In another very similar work, Wu et al. developed a targeted, multifunctional chemo-photothermal system consisting of DOX-loaded PMO nanospheres wrapped with polyethyleneimine (PEI)-modified MoS2 nanosheets having the targeting moiety FA conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA-FA) attached to its surface.[179] The developed PMOsDOX@MoS2-PEI-BSA-FA nanocomposites showed excellent biocompatibility, high drug loading capacity, and dual stimulus (pH and NIR) responsive controlled drug release. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated the tremendous potential of this nanosystem for achieving targeted killing of tumor cells in response to synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy. Alternatively, a novel outside-in synthesis approach was adopted by Zhao et al. for synthesizing mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) with MoS2 nanosheets loaded into its pores.[180] The formed MSN/MoS2 nanoparticles were surface functionalized with polyethylene glycol to impart high colloidal stability and biocompatibility. By exploiting the porous nature of the synthesized nanoparticles, the PEGylated nanoparticles were then loaded with the drug DOX and used as a nanocarrier for synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy of colon carcinoma, both in vitro and in vivo. The excellent NIR-responsive photothermal behavior of MoS2 nanosheets in combination with DOX resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition in mice bearing HT29 tumors.\nIn addition to nanosheets, MoS2 nanodots have also been explored as a tool for cancer therapy. Zhang et al. synthesized MoS2 nanodots modified with copolymer P(OEGA-co-VBA) and targeting ligand transferrin (Tf).[181] The nanocomposites were loaded with DOX which showed good physiological stability, pH, and glutathione dual responsive enhanced drug delivery and high cellular uptake by HepG2 cells. In presence of NIR irradiation, the drug-loaded nanocomposites showed efficient photothermal heating and enhanced killing of the cancer cells due to chemo-photothermal therapy. Very recently, Deng et al. reported a facile exfoliation method using protein for synthesizing biocompatible MoS2 nanosheets and utilized it as a photothermally triggered drug delivery system for synergistic tumor therapy.[182] The MoS2 nanosheets were prepared by physical ultrasonic exfoliation technique using BSA, which functioned as an auxiliary agent for exfoliation as well as a surfactant for MoS2 nanosheets (Figure 7a). The synthesized nanosheets exhibited great stability, high NIR-absorbance (sevenfold), and high drug-loading efficiency. The anticancer drug, resveratrol (RV), was loaded onto these nanosheets via noncovalent interactions. RV is a natural antioxidant found in grapes which can inhibit platelet aggregation, reduce blood viscosity, and prevent the development and further growth of cancer.[183,184] Raji cells were employed as a model for investigating the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of the nanosheets. BSA functionalized MoS2 nanosheets exhibited high cellular uptake and very low cytotoxicity thereby showing their biocompatibility. On the other hand, the MoS2-RV nanosheets showed NIR-triggered drug delivery and increased cytotoxicity toward the cancer cells and tissues, both in vitro and in vivo, as compared to chemotherapy and photothermal therapy alone (Figure 7b,c). The researchers also studied the biodistribution of MoS2 nanosheets with respect to time in various organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and tumor) and observed that\nSmall 2019, 15, 1803706\n1803706 (18 of 33)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\nwww.small-journal.com\nliver and spleen had maximum Mo content and it decreased with time, implying easy excretion of MoS2 (Figure 7b). Overall, the researchers concluded that NIR controlled MoS2RV system has the capability of magnificent tumor therapeutic effect to ablate tumor with no reoccurrence."

The two major classes of vectors which are employed for gene delivery are viral vectors and nonviral vectors. Viral vectors though show high rate of transfection and rapid transcription yet suffers from disadvantages of random integration into host genome, high immunogenicity, cytotoxicity, restriction in insert size, and high production costs. So nonviral vectors like cationic lipids, polysaccharides, dendrimers, and polymers have been developed as a promising and safer alternative candidate for gene therapy.[187,188] Significant advancement in the field of polymer science and materials chemistry has resulted in considerable progress in the development of novel cationic polymers and nanomaterials for nucleic acid delivery.[189] Among the classes of nanomaterials being explored for nucleic acid delivery, 2D\nSmall 2019, 15, 1803706\n1803706 (19 of 33)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\nwww.small-journal.com\nmaterials such as graphene and its derivatives and recently MoS2 have gained a lot of interest. MoS2 being a potential candidate for biological applications has accelerated its interest to be explored as a nanocarrier for gene therapy.\nKou et al. demonstrated nucleic acid delivery using MoS2based nanocomposite.[190] The researchers developed a positively charged MoS2-based gene delivery system (MoS2-PEGPEI) which could bind with siRNA by electrostatic interaction. The functionalization of MoS2 nanosheets with PEG and later with PEI not only enhanced the biocompatibility but also enhanced the stability of the nanocomposites in both saline and serum containing cell medium at room temperature (Figure 8a). It was found that the MoS2-PEG-PEI nanosheets were found to be nontoxic toward cells at tested concentrations. siRNA against Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) oncogene was used in this study as a model nucleic acid sequence to demonstrate the nucleic acid delivery potential of the synthesized nanocomposite. MoS2-PEG-PEI showed strong siRNA binding ability and successfully delivered it inside the cells as tested through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot analysis of PLK-1 knockdown (Figure 8b–d). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that MoS2-PEG-PEI can be used as a nanocarrier for siRNA delivery and can offer new opportunities in biomedical field.\nExploiting the photothermal effect of MoS2 nanosheets, Kim and co-workers designed a stimuli-responsive MoS2-PEIPEG nanocarrier capable of forming highly stable nanosized complexes with DNA via electrostatic interactions.[191] The nanocomposite showed high absorbance in NIR region and was thus exploited for photothermally enhanced gene delivery. PEGylation of the nanocomposite enabled effective gene transfection even in the presence of serum, which is promising for further in vivo application. The photothermally triggered endosomal rupture was investigated and it revealed that hyperthermia induced by the NIR laser irradiated MoS2PEI-PEG affects only its immediate region thereby rupturing the endosomal membrane without causing any heat damage to the whole cell. In addition to this, the polymers PEG and PEI were attached to the nanosheets via disulfide bonds which made them sensitive to high intracellular GSH concentrations, which ultimately resulted in the detachment of the polymers from the nanosheets causing release of the nucleic acids from the nanocomposite inside the cells. Recently, Kong et al. synthesized fifth generation polyamidoamine (G5) dendrimer functionalized MoS2 nanoflakes and demonstrated combined gene silencing and photothermal therapy of tumors.[192] The G5-MoS2 nanoflakes exhibited good colloidal and photothermal stability, along with excellent NIRresponsive photo thermal behavior. The G5-MoS2 nanoflakes successfully delivered pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2) siRNA to 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells causing 47.3% inhibition of Bcl-2 protein expression. Single mode gene therapy using G5-MoS2/Bcl-2 siRNA polyplexes and single mode PTT using G5-MoS2 resulted in 68.7 and 45.8% of cell viability,\nSmall 2019, 15, 1803706\n1803706 (20 of 33)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\nwww.small-journal.com\nrespectively, in in vitro studies. On the other hand, when both NIR laser treatment and gene therapy were used in combination, the researchers observed that the cell viability was only 21.0% thus clearly demonstrating the enhanced therapeutic efficiency of combined photothermal therapy and gene silencing. Further, the efficiency of this combined treatment strategy was also demonstrated in a xenografted 4T1 tumor model in vivo, which also showed similar results as in vitro. So, both in vitro and in vivo data suggested that the synthesized G5-MoS2 nanoflakes could serve as an efficient nanomedicine for combined gene silencing and PTT of tumors. Han et al. demonstrated photothermally enhanced immunotherapy for treating breast cancer by successfully delivering an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide CpG using PEGylated MoS2 nanosheets.[193] In vitro studies revealed that MoS2-PEG-CpG nanoconjugates were readily taken up by macrophage cells in culture and caused stimulation of the macrophages through TLR9 activation resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of the overall immune response level. It was also observed that the excellent NIR-responsive photothermal conversion efficiency of MoS2 nanosheets further enhanced the cellular uptake of the nanoconjugates by increasing the cell membrane permeability through localized heat generation. In addition to this, the researchers also exploited this nanocomposite for photothermally enhanced immunotherapy of breast cancer by coculturing 4T1 cells with macrophages in an in vitro setup. Stimulation of the macrophages with MoS2-PEG-CpG nanoconjugates followed by NIR irradiation resulted in significant decrease in breast cancer cell proliferation and enhanced cytotoxicity, which could be explained as a result of production of more antitumor cytokines by the macrophages in response to combined photo-immunotherapy thereby increasing the cytotoxicity to cancer cells. As a result, this study opened up a new possibility of using MoS2-based nanocomposites as a tool for modulating immune responses in a host toward a specific therapeutic outcome. In a very recent work by Yin et al., a siRNA delivery system was synthesized for the treatment of pancreatic cancer by first functionalizing MoS2 nanosheets with folic acid conjugated LA-PEG followed by coating with cationic polymer poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH).[194] The nanocomposites were used to deliver two siRNAs (HDAC1 and KRAS siRNAs) to Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells and tumors. The nanocomposites showed very high transfection efficiency which resulted in significant downregulation of the expression of HDAC1 and KRAS genes that ultimately led to inhibition of pancreatic cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. In presence of NIR mediated phototherapy, the combined photogene silencing effect resulted in 78% suppression of in vivo tumor growth, which was higher than only photothermal therapy (47%) and gene silencing (56%)."

The PEGylated MoS2 nanosheets exhibited high stability in physiological solutions and the Ce6 loading ratio was found to be 30% which was much more than that on PEGylated GO. 4T1 tumor cells were employed as model for determining the efficiency of PDT. Results revealed that the uptake of drug was time dependent and MoS2-PEG nanosheets exhibited no cytotoxicity at tested concentrations. Later, in combination with photothermal therapy and photodynamic therapy, the MoS2-PEG/Ce6 nanosheets showed higher therapeutic efficiency, both in vitro and in vivo (Figure 9b,c). Recently, Peng et al. synthesized a multifunctional nanosystem for synergistic tumor therapy using 2D MoS2.[196] The nanocarrier was formed by functionalizing MoS2 nanosheets with lipoic acid-PEG modification (MoS2-LA-PEG), along with a pH-responsive charge convertible peptide K11(DMA), which is negatively charged and can be converted to positive charge under acidic conditions. Also, a positively charged photosensitizer toluidine blue ortho (TBO) was loaded onto MoS2 by physical absorption. Due to the charge conversion in response to acidic pH of the tumor microenvironment, the binding force between TBO and MoS2 gets reduced, thereby releasing TBO and exhibiting both PTT and PDT."

      "heading" : "4.6. MoS2-Based Nanocomposites for Bioimaging",
      "text" : "MoS2-based nanocomposites have also been exploited for bioimaging applications to study the internal properties of cells and tissues and to perform real-time monitoring of intracellular trafficking of nanoparticles and drugs.[78] Bioimaging uses light, electrons, X-ray, positrons, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance (MR) as imaging sources. The use of heavy metals and semiconductor QDs as imaging probes cause severe health and environment issues due to its highly toxic nature. Among all the layered materials known, MoS2 QDs have emerged as one of the potential candidates for bioimaging.[78] MoS2 QDs have been found to show good biocompatibility, high stability in physiological fluids, and good single-photon and two-photon fluorescence imaging properties. Apart from conventional fluorescence microscopy techniques that are routinely used for bioimaging applications, many other techniques such as two-photon fluorescence excitation microscopy, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), super-resolution microscopy, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) have been developed. Two-photon fluorescence (TPF) imaging is a technique where two photons of longer wavelength are used to emit a photon of shorter wavelength.[197] In TPF, fluorescent probes concurrently absorb two less energetic photons to reach excited states. This imaging technique allows to image living tissue up to 1 mm depth. It uses NIR light for excitation as it offers minimum scattering in the tissue. Multiphoton absorption suppresses the background signal and it contributes to increased depth for TPF microscopes. TPF has emerged as a powerful tool for research in biological field due to its exceptional properties, such as deep tissue penetration, minimum autofluorescence, and reduced photobleaching.[198,199] The following section discusses the bioimaging applications of MoS2 nanosheets and MoS2 QDs focusing on the single-photon,\ntwo-photon, and multiphoton fluorescent properties of the nanomaterials. Studies related to imaging combined with different therapeutic approaches have been summarized in a later section that includes other forms of imaging namely photoacoustic imaging (PAI), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET).\nA one-step solvothermal process for the synthesis of TPF MoS2 QDs was reported by Lin et al. using ammonium tetrathiomolybdate ((NH4)2MoS4) as a reactant and oleyl amine as a reducing agent.[77] The synthesized MoS2 QDs had a thickness of ≈3 nm and exhibited size-dependent tunable photoluminescence in the wide visible region. The optical properties and structure of as-prepared MoS2 QDs are investigated systematically. 293T cells treated with the synthesized MoS2 QDs showed fluorescent signals from the cytoplasm, thereby demonstrating the applicability of the MoS2 QDs as fluorescent probes for real-time optical cellular imaging. Wu et al. synthesized luminescent MoS2 quantum dots via ultrasonic exfoliation of MoS2 nanosheets in the presence of sodium ions as an intercalating agent in an alkaline environment.[139] The synthesized quantum dots exhibited excitation-dependent emission behavior covering the broad visible region and were used to label lung cells in vitro (Figure 10a). Confocal microscopy studies revealed that the MoS2 QDs were successfully internalized by the lung cells and were mostly localized in the cytoplasm of the cells as observed from the bright fluorescent signals coming from those regions (Figure 10b).\nA top-down, facile, environment-friendly synthesis of MoS2 QDS using ethanol-thermal route was reported by Gu et al.[200] Due to their small size, high stability, low toxicity, and TPF ability, the as-prepared MoS2 QDs were employed as TPF probes for bioimaging of MDA-MB-468 cells in vitro. The MDAMB-468 cells treated with different concentrations of MoS2 QDs showed more than 80% viability and were successfully imaged through TPF microscopy. These results demonstrated the suitability of MoS2 QDs for staining the cellular nuclei and deep-tissue imaging applications. Liu et al. reported a onestep, green method for the synthesis of bright blue luminescent MoS2 QDs.[201] The MoS2 QDs showed high crystallinity, narrow size distribution, high stability in aqueous solution, and excitation-dependent photoluminescence behavior. HeLa cells were incubated with the MoS2 QDs, which showed good biocompatibility and bright fluorescence signal from within the cells. In addition, Dong et al. developed a facile and tunable synthesis of MoS2 QDs using a tetrabutylammonium-assisted ultrasonication technique and multilayered MoS2 powder as the precursor.[138] The MoS2 QDs produced by this method were highly stable, biocompatible, and exhibited both upconversion and downconversion photoluminescence behavior that was utilized for imaging of HeLa cells in vitro.\nVery recently, multiphoton fluorescence imaging using single-layered MoS2 nanosheets have been reported by Zhong et al.[202] The researchers demonstrated that chitosan functionalized small MoS2 nanosheets can act as nonbleaching and nonblinking nanoprobes for strong two-photon luminescence (TPL) and strong second harmonic generation (SHG) bioimaging under the excitation of a low power NIR laser. In another recent study, the researchers reported the synthesis of MoS2\nSmall 2019, 15, 1803706\n1803706 (22 of 33)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, among all the QDs synthesized, GSH conjugated QDs showed the strongest fluorescence, smaller size, and high biocompatibility, and thus was selected as a fluorescent probe for imaging HeLa cells in vitro."

      "heading" : "4.7. MoS2-Based Nanocomposites for Theranostic Applications",
      "text" : "The term theranostics refers to a treatment strategy that involves both therapy as well as diagnosis in the form of imaging in a single platform. Due to the presence of excellent optical and physicochemical properties, nanomaterials have emerged as agents for developing novel theranostic tools. Working toward such a goal, different types of MoS2-based nanotheranostic agents have been developed and successfully explored for both in vitro and in vivo applications. Yin et al. reported a simple, low-cost method to synthesize monolayered MoS2 nanosheets with controlled size and demonstrated their application as NIR photothermal-triggered drug delivery system.[98] MoS2 nanosheets produced using liquid-phase exfoliation method (oleum treatment) were decorated with chitosan (CS) to increase their functionality. DOX, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug was loaded and then controllably released at the target site using 808 nm NIR light. The results showed that chitosan decorated MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2-CS) show high absorption in NIR region and exhibit high stability, biocompatibility, and zero hemolysis. In vivo and in vitro tumor ablation studies showed that combined chemotherapy and photothermal therapy provide better therapeutic effect than chemotherapy and photothermal therapy alone. In addition to being used as chemo-photothermal platform, the researchers also demonstrated X-ray computed tomography imaging using these nanosheets as contrast agent because of the ability of Mo to absorb X-rays. The X-ray CT image of CS decorated MoS2 nanosheets (CS-MoS2) exhibited obvious signal enhancement with increase in concentration of the agents is shown in (Figure 11a,b). The efficiency of the CS-MoS2 nanosheets was confirmed by studying the CT values, also known as Hounsfield units (HU). CS-MoS2 nanosheets showed high potential as a new CT contrast agent, even better than commercially used lopromide 300. Thus, the synthesized MoS2-CS nanosheets served as a promising nanotheranostic platform for cancer therapy. Liu et al. reported that PEG decorated MoS2-IO (MoS2 and iron oxide) nanocomposites showed better stability in physiological environment.[204] The MoS2-IO nanocomposites were prepared by self-assembling iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) on MoS2 nanosheets with a feeding ratio of 5:1, so that MoS2 nanosheets were fully covered by IONPs. These nanocomposites were then functionalized with two types of PEG-thiolated polymer LA-PEG and amine-terminated branched PEG, which showed enhanced stability in saline solution containing glutathione. Following this, a positron-emitting radioisotope 64Cu was adsorbed on the surface of the nanocomposites without any chelator molecules and used for in vivo PET imaging. In addition to this, photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and MR imaging was also performed using these nanocomposites by exploiting the high NIR absorption and super-paramagnetism of the composites. Using this triple-modal imaging as a guiding tool, in vivo photothermal therapy was performed in 4T1 tumorbearing mice that resulted in successful ablation of tumor (Figure 11c–e). In the same year, another group reported the development of a magnetic MoS2 nanocomposite by attaching ultrasmall Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of multilayered MoS2 nanoflakes through a two-step hydrothermal process.[205] The formed MoS2/Fe3O4 nanocomposites were then PEGylated and applied for dual-modal T2-weighted MR and PAT imaging guided magnetically targeted photothermal therapy of cancer, both in vitro and in vivo. The nanocomposites showed excellent biocompatibility and was found to successfully cause complete remission of tumors in PANC-1 cells bearing BALB/c nude mice under the influence of magnetically targeted photothermal therapy and without any signs of tumor relapse. For further exploring the multifunctional theranostic potential of MoS2/ Fe3O4 nanocomposites, Liu et al. synthesized MoS2 nanoflowers with tunable size ranging from 80 to 180 nm by\nSmall 2019, 15, 1803706\n1803706 (23 of 33)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\nwww.small-journal.com\na one-step hydrothermal method.[206] The as-synthesized MoS2 nanoflowers were first functionalized with PEI followed by covalent conjugation with Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The obtained MoS2/Fe3O4 nanoflowers were then loaded with a photosensitizer ICG and a chemotherapeutic prodrug Pt(IV) to finally form the multifunctional MoS2@ Fe3O4-ICG/Pt(IV) nanocomposite. The researchers demonstrated excellent magnetic resonance/infrared thermal/photoacoustic trimodal bioimaging along with highly efficient combined PDT/PTT/chemotherapy of H22 tumor-bearing Balb/c mice in response to a single 808 nm NIR laser. Further, the biodistribution and long-term toxicity of the synthesized nanocomposites were also evaluated in detail which showed no signs of toxicity to major organs like lung, heart, liver, spleen, and kidney, and the nanocomposites could be easily excreted from the mice with time. As a result, the developed MoS2/Fe3O4 nanoflowers have the potential to emerge as a successful nanomedicine platform for future theranostic applications. Very recently, another novel MoS2/ Fe3O4-based nanotheranostic was reported by Xie et al. for MRI- guided chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer.[207] They synthesized Fe3O4@MoS2 nanocubes (IOMS NCs) via a hydrothermal method by integrating MoS2 film onto iron oxide nanocubes. The synthesized IOMS NCs were then PEGylated to improve physiological stability and subsequently functionalized with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a nonmetabolizable glucose analogue as a tumor targeting agent and loaded with the chemotherapeutic drug DOX to form IOMS-PEG (DOX)-2DG NCs nanocomposite. The functionalized nanocubes showed high drug loading capacity and excellent NIR-responsive photothermal transducing behavior that was exploited for in vivo therapeutic treatment of breast cancer. Intravenous injection of the IOMS-PEG (DOX)-2DG NCs nanocomposites into MDAMB-231 tumor-bearing mice under the influence of an external magnetic field and in the presence of a 808 nm laser irradiation resulted in complete eradication of the tumors as a result of synergistic action of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy that was found to be enhanced by the 2DG mediated active targeting of tumors. High accumulation of the nanocomposites in the tumor region could be easily detected by MRI after 24 h of intravenous injection. Radiotherapy is one of the efficient techniques for cancer treatment that employs ionizing radiation such as X-rays, gamma rays, and particle radiation for killing cancer cells either by breaking the DNA of the cells and/or by inducing oxidative stress.[208] The radiation can be used in two ways: either externally or internally. In external radiotherapy, ionizing radiation is used whereas in internal radiation a biocompatible radioisotope is introduced inside the body.[209] This radioisotope radiates gamma rays which in turn kills the cancer cells. Even though it is an effective technique to kill tumor cells, it has got some pitfalls such as requirement of elevated doses, development of radiation resistance after a certain time, injury to nearby cells, and low efficiency toward hypoxic cancer cells.[209] It has been reported that hyperthermia can enhance the radiation sensitivity toward hypoxic cells by increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in and around the cells.[210] Hence, the pitfalls can be overcome by designing a composite having high radiation attenuation as well as high photothermal effect to cause hyperthermia. Wang et al. designed a MoS2/Bi2S3-PEG nanocomposite (MBP) with good biocompatibility for combined radiotherapy and photothermal therapy by exploiting the photothermal effect of MoS2 and high X-ray attenuation of Bi2S3.[211]\nSmall 2019, 15, 1803706\n1803706 (24 of 33)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\nwww.small-journal.com\nThe MBP nanocomposites were synthesized by a one-pot solvothermal process using (NH4)2MoS4 and Bi(NO3)3·5H2O as precursors, followed by PEGylation. The cytocompatibility of the MBP nanosheets was investigated using CCK-8 assay, cell morphology observations, and trypan blue staining. All data indicated that MBP has good cytocompatibility. Next, MBP nanosheets were intratumorally injected into 4T1 mouse model followed by laser and X-ray irradiation. It was found that MBP showed a remarkable PTT efficiency, as well as unique radiation enhancement effects. The MBP nanosheets showed a concentration/laser power dependent photothermal transduction. Therefore, it was revealed that combined photothermal therapy and radiotherapy was more effective in killing tumor cells than photothermal therapy and radiotherapy alone. The researchers also utilized these MBP nanosheets for CT/PA dual-imaging guided diagnosis of tumor in vivo by exploiting the excellent X-ray attenuation and radiosensitization property of Bi2S3 nanoparticles and photoacoustic properties of MoS2 nanosheets, thereby making the MBP nanocomposites a new type of multimodal imaging guided combined therapeutic platform. The theranostic potential of these MBP nanocomposites was further extended by Wang group by developing an injectable and phasechangeable agar-based hydrogel.[212] The hydrogel was formed by incorporating MBP nanocomposites along with a chemotherapeutic drug DOX and an antibiotic into an agar solution at an elevated temperature. Direct intratumoral administration of this hydrogel solution into HT29 tumor-bearing mice resulted in in situ formation of the hydrogel at the normal body temperature. As a result, the hydrogel formed inside the tumor region served as an on-demand drug delivery vessel. It was observed that the formed hydrogel retained the CT/PA bimodal imaging properties of the MBP nanocomposite and also exhibited successful chemo-photothermal treatment of the tumor. Controlled release of the drugs from the hydrogel was observed as a result of the heat generated by the MBP nanocomposites in response to NIR laser that promoted diffusion of drug through the hydrogel. In addition to this, incorporation of an antibiotic into the hydrogel also helped in preventing any wound infection during the surgery. Apart from nanosheets, MoS2 nanodots have also been explored as a potential theranostic platform. Very recently, Liu et al. reported a MoS2 nanodot based bio-clearable theranostic agent.[213] MoS2 nanodots were prepared by bottomup approach by decomposing ammonium tetrathiomolybdate solvothermally using hydrazine as reducing agent and PVP as surfactant. The as-synthesized MoS2 nanodots were functionalized with different kinds of thiol-containing molecules, such as PEG, cysteine (Cys), and GSH. Out of all three, GSH was found to be most appropriate molecule for designing MoS2 as it was found that MoS2-GSH nanodots exhibited ultrasmall hydrodynamic size, high stability in physiological solution, and longer blood-circulation half-life contributing high accumulation in tumors. The MoS2-GSH nanodots did not exhibit any appreciable in vitro cytotoxicity but showed high photothermal conversion ability and efficient tumor-homing capability that resulted in successful PTT treatment. The injected MoS2-GSH nanodots were also used for PAI and it was observed that the intravenously injected MoS2-GSH nanodots were excreted out within a week via urine due to smaller hydrodynamic sizes. Another MoS2 quantum dot based nanotheranostic agent was developed by Wang et al. by modifying the quantum dot surface with a polyaniline (PANI) shell followed by attachment of PEG to form MoS2@PANI-PEG nanohybrids.[214] The nanohybrids showed excellent photothermal conversion efficiency, photostability, and radiosensitizing properties. In addition, they also served as contrast agents for X-ray computed tomography and photoacoustic imaging of tumors due to strong NIR absorption and X-ray attenuation abilities of MoS2. As a result, the MoS2@PANI-PEG nanohybrids demonstrated highly efficient in vitro and in vivo bimodal imaging guided combined PTT-radiotherapy of tumors. In another study, monolayer MoS2 nanodots (M-MoS2 NDs) were synthesized and loaded with thiolated DOX, which served as an intracellular glutathioneresponsive drug delivery system.[215] The drug-loaded nanodots were readily taken up by HeLa cells in culture and showed enhanced cytotoxicity as compared to free DOX. In vivo results also suggested that intracellular glutathione could readily induce drug release from the nanodots in mice. In addition to this, the fluorescence properties of the nanodots could also be used for in vitro and in vivo bioimaging and particle tracking thereby making this platform suitable for fluorescence imaging guided chemotherapy. Chen et al. synthesized a theranostic platform by forming a complex of bovine serum albumingadolinium (BSA-Gd prepared by biomineralization method) conjugated with MoS2 nanoflakes through an amide bond.[216] The as-prepared BSA-Gd-MoS2 showed strong photostability and photothermal effect. Various experiments confirmed the efficiency of BSA-Gd-MoS2 in ablating cancer cells. Also, it showed strong NIR absorbance which serves as a potential agent for good PAI. 4T1 cells were examined for photothermal cytotoxicity. It was observed that NIR laser alone did not affect cell viability much, but the as-prepared BSA-Gd modified MoS2 along with NIR light affected the cancer cells significantly and suppressed tumor growth. Han et al. incorporated PTT, PDT, and upconversion luminescence-based bioimaging into a single theranostic platform by developing chitosan functionalized MoS2 nanosheets covalently grafted with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and decorated with the targeting agent folic acid.[217] MoS2-UCNP-FA was further loaded with the photosensitizer phthalocyanine (ZnPc) to form MoS2-UCNP-FA/ZnPc nanocomposites that were used for upconversion luminescence guided synergistic phototherapy of cancer. Both in vitro and in vivo studies revealed the imaging properties of this nanocomposite for tracking the intracellular distribution of the nanocomposites and visualization of deep tissue tumors and at the same time also established the enhanced therapeutic efficiency of synergistic PTT-PDT over conventional therapy solely using PTT or PDT. In a very recent work, Dong et al. reported the synthesis of a multifunctional MoS2-based nanotheranostic platform for overcoming drug resistance in breast cancer.[218] MoS2 nanosheets were first functionalized with the polymer PEI followed by decoration with biodegradable hyaluronic acid (HA) as a targeting agent (Figure 12a). HA not only helped in targeting CD44 overexpressing MCF-7-ADR cells but also accelerated the release of DOX from the nanosheets inside the tumor microenvironment due to degradation of HA by hyaluronidase that is present in high concentrations inside tumor. In addition to this, the researchers also exploited the excellent NIR-responsive\nSmall 2019, 15, 1803706\n1803706 (25 of 33)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\nwww.small-journal.com\nphotothermal transduction property of MoS2 to further accelerate the drug release. Because of the combined effects of HA targeting and NIR exposure, the MoS2-PEI-HA nanocomposites showed enhanced killing of the drug-resistant MCF-7 cells and downregulated the expression of drug-resistancerelated P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (Figure 12b). Following this, the researchers also reported the application of these MoS2-PEI-HA nanocomposites labeled with 64Cu for real-time PET imaging of MCF-7-ADR tumor in mice, thereby demonstrating the theranostic potential of the nanocomposites (Figure 12c)."

      "text" : "Electrochemical Biosensing: In electrochemical biosensing, various kinds of electrodes with diverse surface functionalizations are used to detect the presence of biomolecules such as glucose, dopamine (DA), DNA, and many more. An electrochemical biosensor is composed of a diffusion barrier, a working electrode (sensing-electrode, measuring electrode, or anode), an electrolyte, and a counter-electrode (cathode). Wu et al. reported the electrochemical reduction of single-layer MoS2 nanosheets (rMoS2) which were then employed for glucose and biomolecule detection.[219] 3-Aminopropyl-triethoxysilane modified glassy carbon electrode with MoS2 (GCE-APTES-MoS2\nSmall 2019, 15, 1803706\n1803706 (26 of 33)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\nwww.small-journal.com\nSmall 2019, 15, 1803706\nelectrode) absorbed on it was used as the electrode material for electrochemical sensing of glucose and dopamine in the presence of other biomolecules such as uric acid (UA) and ascorbic acid (AA). The electrode showed good conductivity and high electron transfer rate.\nA MoS2-based label-free ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor for detection of DNA was developed by Wang et al.[220] The basic idea behind development of this biosensor was (a) high electrochemical activity of the ultrasonically exfoliated thin-layer MoS2 nanosheets and (b) differential affinity of MoS2 nanosheets toward single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The thin-layer MoS2 nanosheets were deposited on the surface of a bare carbon paste electrode (CPE) followed by immobilization of single-stranded DNA molecules. This sensing platform was then used to electrochemically detect a target complimentary DNA sequence in the concentration range of 1.0 × 10−16 to 1.0 × 10−10 m with a detection limit of 1.9 × 10−17 m, with high specificity and sensitivity (Figure 13). The researchers further extended the sensing application of the developed biosensor and demonstrated simultaneous detection of adenine and guanine.\nOptical Biosensing: Optical biosensing includes usage of fluorescent or luminescent materials for detecting various biomolecules and enzymes. MoS2 nanosheets have been found to demon strate a high fluorescence quenching making them potential candidates for optical sensing. Combined with this property, the ability of MoS2 nanosheets to show different affinity toward ssDNA and dsDNA have led to the development of fluorescence quenching based optical biosensors for the rapid detection and screening of DNA sequences. Zhu et al. reported the development of single-layer MoS2 nanoprobes for detection of DNA and other biomolecules and demonstrated\nthat in the absence of a target DNA sequence, the fluorescence intensity of the fluorophore tagged reporter DNA was significantly quenched by the MoS2 nanosheets.[221] However, in the presence of the target DNA sequence, the fluorescence was restored and an increase in signal was observed with increase in target DNA concentration, thereby showing the weak interaction of MoS2 nanosheets with dsDNA as compared to ssDNA. Using the similar sensing technique, a novel monolayered MoS2-based microfluidic biosensor was reported for ultrasensitive DNA detection.[222] Highly concentrated chemically exfoliated thin layered MoS2 nanosheets mixed with ssDNA and dsDNA molecules in zig-zag shaped microchannels demonstrated rapid real-time detection and screening of DNA within minutes (Figure 14a–c).\nAptamer-functionalized MoS2-based optical biosensors have also been developed for biomolecule detection. Kong et al. developed an aptamer-functionalized MoS2 biosensor for detecting prostate specific antigen (PSA).[223] A rigid aptamer structure, induced by strong aptamer–PSA binding, made the weak Van der Waals forces of interaction even weaker and resulted in the release of the aptamer probe from MoS2 nanosheets with simultaneous fluorescence recovery. The biosensor also showed satisfactory results when applied to detection of PSA in human serum samples.\nA MoS2-based sensor to detect the activity of DNA methyltransferase enzyme was developed by Deng et al., where MoS2 nanosheets were prepared by ethanol-water-assisted sonication process.[224] The nanosheets were employed as energy acceptors in fluorescence quenching for the detection of DNA methyltransferase where a dsDNA containing DNA adenosine methyltransferase (Dam) recognition sequence and ssDNA was anchored with the substrate DNA onto MoS2 nanosheets by Van der Waals interaction. When the substrate DNA was absorbed on the MoS2 nanosheets, fluorescence of the dsDNA got quenched, whereas when it got methylated by Dam, the fluorescence got restored (Figure 14d,e).\nFET-Based Biosensing: A FET-based sensor is generally an insulated gate field-effect transistor in which the ion-conducting liquid solution replaces an electron-conducting solid gate electrode. There is no physical gate in a FET-based biosensor and some specific receptors are used for selective capture of desired biomolecules. MoS2 nanosheets have high surface-to-volume ratio which enhances dielectric properties as well as provides active sites for adsorption of analyte molecules. A FET biosensor based on MoS2 with high sensitivity as well as easy patternability have been developed by Sarkar et al. (Figure 15).[225] This biosensor could work in aqueous environment and in subthreshold region. Streptavidin and biotin were utilized as target and receptor molecules. It showed an ultrahigh sensitivity of 196 even at 100 × 10−15 m concentration. It was demonstrated that this biosensor could also detect pH changes in an electrolytic solution. The mechanism involved is protonation/deprotonation of hydroxyl group on gate dielectric. It demonstrated high pH sensitivity of 713 for a pH change by 1 unit over a vast range of pH (3–9).\nA label-free biosensor using multilayer MoS2 nanosheet based FET device for detecting cancer biomarker protein PSA was reported by Wang et al.[226] The biosensor showed high sensitivity down to the concentration of 375 × 10−15 m of PSA in\n1803706 (27 of 33)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

MoS2 nanosheets have low electronic conductivity and thus the as-synthesized nanocomposites may help in overcoming the pitfalls. AuNPs decorated MoS2 nanocomposite was prepared via a microwave-assisted hydrothermal process.[227] The AuNPs-MoS2 nanocomposite functionalized electrode detected DA with a detection limit of 80 × 10−3 m.

Su et al. developed an electrochemical glucose biosensor by halting GOx on AuNPs-MoS2 modified glass carbon electrode, which exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity.[229] The sensor could detect glucose over a wide range of concentration from 10 to 300 × 10−6 m, with a lower detection limit of 2.8 × 10−6 m. For selective sensing of tryptophan, an Ag-MoS2/CS nanocomposite was synthesized by Xia et al.[230] Silver nanoflakes (AgNFs) were directly synthesized on surface of MoS2 nanosheets, using chitosan as a stabilizer and ascorbic acid as reducing agent. The Ag-MoS2/CS nanocomposite demonstrated an excellent catalytic activity for oxidizing tryptophan over a wide range and a lower detection limit. The Ag-MoS2/CS nanocomposite was easy to synthesize, less toxic, selective, and sensitive, and exhibited surface functionalities, which made it a promising agent in biological and organic electroanalysis and electrocatalysis. Besides AuNPs and AgNPs, some other metal nanoparticles have also been used to fabricate MoS2 nanocomposites to develop sensors. One such electrochemical sensor is Cu-MoS2 nanocomposite, synthesized by Huang et al. which showed high sensitivity (1055 mA mm cm2) toward glucose over a wide range of concentration up to 4 × 10−3 m.[231]\nMoS2-graphene nanocomposite has been known to have magnificent electron conductivity and hence excellent electrochemical performance. A MoS2-graphene composite was\ndeveloped using a modified l-cysteine-assisted solution-phase method for detecting acetoaminophen.[232] The as-prepared composite was used to redesign electrodes for electrochemical sensors. The sensor exhibited outstanding analytical performance for acetoaminophen detection due to robust composite structure and cooperative effects between graphene and MoS2 nanosheets. The synthesized electrochemical sensor demonstrated a detection limit of 2.0 × 10−8 m and linear range of 0.1–100 × 10−6 m for acetoaminophen.\nDNA sensors based on MoS2 nanocomposites have also been reported recently. MoS2-graphene-AuNPs/CS composite was used to modify the glass electrode, on which the ssDNA probe was assembled.[233] A thiol-tagged DNA strand coupled to horseradish peroxidase conjugated to AuNPs served as tracer. The sensor demonstrated sensitivity toward DNA over a wide range of 5.0 × 10−14–5.0 × 10−9 m with lower detection limit of 2.2 × 10−15 m. Single-base mismatch and three-base mismatch sequences of DNA could be distinguished using this sensor. Huang et al. reported the development of a electrochemical biosensor for sub-femtomolar detection of DNA.[234] Hydrothermal technique was used to synthesize MoS2/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MoS2/MWCNT). A thiol-tagged DNA probe on MoS2/MWCNT and glucose oxidase (GOD) coupled AuNPs-modified electrode were assembled to construct the electrochemical biosensor. The sensor detected DNA in a femtomolar range of 10 to 107 × 10−15 m with lower detection limit 0.79 × 10−15 m.\n1803706 (29 of 33)\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

      "heading" : "5. Conclusion and Outlook",
      "text" : "In this review, we provide a systematic and detailed overview on the progress of MoS2-based nanomaterials and nanocomposites in the field of nanomedicine in a categorical manner. The different synthesis strategies that have been developed so far for the production of MoS2-based nanomaterials of diverse morphologies have also been reviewed and discussed. The emergence of 2D MoS2 nanomaterials as a novel nanomedicine alternative to graphene and its derivatives in the field of biomedical research can be attributed to the unique structural, optical, electrical, thermal, and biocompatible properties of these nanomaterials. The presence of large surface-area-to-volume ratio and diverse surface chemistry for easy functionalization of this material have helped in achieving high therapeutic and diagnostic cargo loading efficiency and have also facilitated the synthesis of novel multifunctional nanotheranostic platforms, through covalent and noncovalent interactions with biocompatible polymers and targeting moieties.\nDepending on the mode of synthesis, structural features, and physicochemical properties, the different morphologies of MoS2 nanostructures developed so far have been explored for different biomedical applications. Among the diverse set of morphologies developed, nanosheets and nanoflakes synthesized through chemical exfoliation and hydro-solvothermal methods have emerged as the most widely used MoS2 nanostructures for applications in drug/gene delivery, phototherapies, and theranostics. This wide applicability of MoS2 nanosheets and nanoflakes achieved in the field of biomedical applications of TMDs can be attributed to the presence of high surface-area-to-volume ratio suitable for therapeutic cargo loading, easy surface functionalization with polymers, and the excellent NIR-responsive photothermal transducing properties which have made these nanosheets ideal for photothermal applications. A thorough analysis of the diverse biomedical applications of MoS2-based nanostructures revealed that MoS2 has been frequently used as a photothermal agent, either alone or in combination with other therapeutic modalities for photothermally triggered drug/ gene delivery, photothermal ablation of tumors, etc. In addition to this, the inherent X-ray absorbing and photoacoustic properties of MoS2 have also helped in exploring them further as bioimaging contrast agents for developing theranostic platforms. The high electrochemical activity of ultrasonically exfoliated thin-layer MoS2 nanosheets has been exploited for developing electrochemical biosensors. Similarly, quantum dots and nanodots which are known for their interesting intrinsic fluorescence properties, have been specifically explored in the field of bioimaging. In addition to these conventional nanostructures, we have also discussed the synthesis and applications of several other morphologies such as nanoflowers, radar-like, agraic-like, coral-like, etc., that have also contributed toward the development of some novel nanomedicine platforms. Most of these morphologies were found to be modifications or derivatives of nanosheet structures and hence have been mostly explored for NIR-responsive photothermal applications.\nThough a significant progress has been made in exploring this 2D material as a nanomedicine candidate, however, majority of that research has been focused at the in vitro level, with very little focus on understanding the actual mechanism\nof interaction of this class of 2D material with the cells and tissues of the living system. As a result, knowledge related to the toxicity, immunomodulation, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics profile of MoS2-based nanomaterials is still not very clear and hence requires thorough investigation in small as well as large animal models to understand in depth the processes, mechanisms, and outcomes of the interactions of these nanomaterials once they are inside a living host. In addition to this, emphasis should also be given on the development of better synthesis and surface functionalization strategies that can provide a good control on regulating the size distribution of the synthesized nanomaterials, as previous studies with other 2D materials like graphene have already shown that toxicity of nanomaterials is greatly influenced by their size and surface chemistry, with larger size having more toxicity and higher chances of getting phagocytosed and cleared of the circulation by phagocytic cells. However, for achieving a successful clinical translation of MoS2 as a nanomedicine, dedicated collaborative efforts from different disciplines of science and engineering is needed."
