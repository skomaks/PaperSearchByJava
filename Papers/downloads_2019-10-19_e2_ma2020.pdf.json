Due to the different surface state of the nanosheets, the aggregate states of porphyrin molecules were different which could be demonstrated in the UV–vis spectra.

By inducing oxygen groups to the pristine graphene, many properties, such as electrostatic characteristics, conjugated network, surface defects and band gap have significantly changed [10,11]. Generally, by chemical modified graphene, the epoxy and hydroxyl groups are on the basal plane of the graphene sheets while carboxyl and acetate groups are at their edges [12,13]. The distinctive 2D structure of GO with oxygen functional groups can provide multiple reaction sites to further modify GO with specific functions and improve its dispersibility in polar solvents to form stable colloidal dispersion [14]. Meanwhile, by reducing GO through chemical and thermal treatment, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) can be obtained and still retains some oxygen groups attached to the basal plane [15]. It has been confirmed that RGO exhibited high mechanical strength, high performance of electrical, thermal conductivity and electrochemical activity, which can be regarded as an alternative to graphene for applications in nanoelectronics [16–20]. However, there still have many challenges for the various applications of GO-based nanomaterials. One of them is how to prepare well-ordered thin films of GO and GO-based composites. In recent years, self-assembly technology has received more attention due to its simplicity and controllability [21–28]. To fabricate well-ordered and uniform thin films, several techniques have been developed, such as drop-casting, spin-coating, solvent evaporation, layer-by-layer (LBL) and LangmuirBlodgett (LB) assembly [29–37]. To obtain higher quality thin films with controllable thickness, the LB method can be the best candidate to accomplish this challenge, especially for the fabrication of monolayer films. During the process of transformation of Langmuir monolayer from air/liquid interface to solid substrates, the LB technique can precisely control the number and sequence of the layers. To obtain wellordered single and multilayer films with well-controlled thickness, homogeneity, roughness, in LB method, many parameters can be adjusted, such as barrier speed, temperature and pH of subphase, substrate, material composition, deposition pressure and evaporation time [38,39]. Generally, the amphiphilic molecules with appropriate hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance can spread on the interface of air/water to form condensed monolayer films after compressing [40]. As containing abundant oxygen functional groups, GO-based sheets can be considered as mimetic amphiphilic molecules with hydrophilic edges and hydrophobic basal plane at the interface. The GO-based sheets can float on the interface without the assistant of stabilizing agents or surfactants and many works about GO-based films prepared by LB technique have been reported [40–42]. With oxygen-rich groups, GObased sheets can play a role of platform for regulating the aggregate state of various dyes. For example, Meral and co-workers have been successfully prepared the two-dimensional GO-pyronin Y composite films with controllable thickness at the air-water interface [43]. Recently, our group has found that various positively charged dyes molecules could self-assemble into ordered H-aggregates and/ or J-aggregates on the surface of GO sheets to form smooth and dense GO-dye composite films by LB method [44]. However, the influence of the surface state of GO or GO-based sheets on the regulation and control the aggregate state of guest molecules on their surface is seldom reported.\nHerein, we report a co-assembly system of GO and surface modified GO-porphyrin (GO-TMPyP) composite films by LB technique, which shows the controllable aggregate state of porphyrin molecules on the surface of the floating sheets, as shown in Scheme 1. In this system, the GO sheets were sulfonation by 4-Aminobenzenesulfonic acid (sulfonated GO, GS) and phenylhydrazine-4-sulfonic acid which also acting as a reductant, simultaneously (reduced sulfonated GO, RGS). The induction of sulfonic group on the surface of GO by different methods can obtain the floating sheets with unique characteristics. With different surface state of the floating sheets, the TMPyP molecules adsorbed and self-assembled on the nanosheets with the regulation of aggregate state, which indicate the surface state of GO sheets have great influence on regulating the aggregate state of porphyrin molecules in the composite LB films."

      "text" : "The materials used in this system, graphite powder (8000 mesh, 99.95%) was obtained from Aladdin Reagent. 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1methyl-4-pyridinio) porphyrin (TMPyP) was purchased from TCI. 4- Aminobenzenesulfonic acid (PASA) and phenylhydrazine-4-sulfonic acid (PHS) were obtained from TCI Shanghai Chemicals without any purification. The graphene oxide was synthetized by a modified Hummers method used graphite powder. Sulfonated GO (GS) was synthesized according to the reported literature [45,46]. Simply, 4- Aminobenzenesulfonic acid (2 g) and NaOH (1 g) were added into single bottle (100mL) containing 30mL deionized water. After being fully dissolved by heating, the single bottle then cooled in an ice-salt bath with constant stirring. Then NaNO2 (0.8 g) was added and kept at 0–5℃. Finally, hydrochloric acid (10mL, 30%) was slowly dripped into the above mixed solution and kept stirring for 30min under 5 ℃. The prepared GO (0.25 g) was added to the prepared diazo salt solution and stirred for 2 h at 0–5 ℃, and then stirred for 8 h at room temperature. Then the mixed solution was transferred to dialysis bag and dialyzed overnight. The final products were collected after drying in a vacuum oven at 80 ℃. Reduced sulfonated GO (RGS) was synthesized according to the previous literature [47]. 0.3 g of prepared GO powder and 1.2 g of phenylhydrazine-4-sulfonic were added into 100mL distilled water with fully ultrasound and stirred. Then the mixture was heated to 85 °C for 12 h. Finally, the samples were dried and purified by using ethanol.\n2.2. Preparation of composite Langmuir films\nGO, GS and RGS sheets were dispersed in methyl alcohol aqueous solution (v/v, 5:1) to form stable colloid dispersion (1mgmL−1) and sonicated for 30min at room temperature. The pH of TMPyP solution (10-4 mol/L) was adjusted to 9 to serve as subphase. Mica, CaF2, and quartz were used as the substrates. The solution of NH4OH: H2O2: H2O (1:1:15) and DI water were used to clean the quartz before use. The KSV-NIMA Mini-tough LB system was used to prepare composite LB films. 1 mL as-prepared colloid dispersions were dripped onto the surface of subphase. After evaporating the solvent for 15min, the films were compressed by barriers at a speed of 2mm/min. The transferred monolayer and multilayers films on different substrates by horizontal and vertical lifting method were used for the further spectral and morphological characterization. The transferred composite monolayer and multilayers at different surface pressures were tested according to the pressure-area isotherm."

      "text" : "3.1. Characterization of pristine GO and surface-modified GO\nThe pristine GO was prepared using the modified Hummer’s method. Sulfonated GO (GS) was prepared by a simple diazotization reaction and reduced sulfonated GO (RGS) was prepared by Fischer osazone reaction, respectively [45–47]. Firstly, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement and transmission electron microscope\n(TEM) were employed to monitor the morphological characteristics of GO with different surface properties, as shown in Fig. 1. Both of the pristine GO and surface-modified GO showed obvious sheets-like structures. Unlike pristine GO, after undergoing the process of surface modification, the GS showed much “soft” surface with more small folds while the RGS showed much smooth and flat surface (Fig. 1b and c). The difference morphological characteristics indicated the successful sulfonation of GO sheets. The TEM images showed the GO and surfacemodified GO sheets with multi-layers possessing relatively large area\nScheme 1. a) Scheme of the synthesis process of GS and RGS; b) Photograph of solid GO, GS and RGS nanosheets; c) Chemical structures of GO, GS RGS and TMPyP; d) Illustration of self-assembly process of the GO-TMPyP and surface modified GO-TMPyP composite Langmuir films.\nwhich laid the foundation of the preparation of Langmuir composite films.\nTo get further insight into the molecular structure of GO with different surface state, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out, as shown in Fig. 2a. The pristine GO showed obvious Bragg peak at 2θ value of 11.48°, which attributed to (001) plane of GO with abundant oxygen-containing groups [48]. After sulphonated by PASA, the peak shifted to the value of 10.56° and the intensity was dramatically decreased. The peak changes indicated that the interlayer distance of GS was larger than the pristine GO after introducing sulfonic groups. Moreover, the intensity of the peak dramatically decreased also suggested that the introduction of sulfonic groups resulted in the reduction of order degree and increase of defect. Compared with GO and GS, the RGS showed a much broader peak located at 25.5° which may cause by the strong electric effects and steric of the organic residual groups of PHS in RGS. The peak attributed to (001) plane disappeared, which confirmed the GO sheets was successfully reduced.\nThe Raman spectra of the GO and surface modified GO were also carried out and shown in Fig. 2b. The characteristic bands located at 1346 cm−1 and 1583 cm−1 were assigned to D band and G band of GO sheets, respectively [49]. After sulphonating by PASA, the D band and G band were shifted to 1357 cm-1 and 1587 cm-1, respectively. As the D band was related to the defects and disorder, the shifted band of GS suggested the changes of its surface state. While the D band of RGS had no obvious shift and the G band was located at around 1604 cm-1. The ratio of D/G represented the graphitization degree of carbon solids. The lower the value, the higher the degree of graphitization. Both the ID/IG value of GS (1.11) and RGS (1.12) were smaller than the value of GO (1.14), which indicated the weak graphitization degree of GS and RGS [50]. The obtained results of Raman spectra were well consistent with the analysis of XRD.\nIn order to confirm the successful sulfonation of GO sheets, FT-IR spectra were carried out for the samples, as shown in Fig. 3. The spectra of GO showed obvious peaks centered at 3403, 1730, 1623, 1059, 1229, 1385 cm−1, which were assigned to the oxygen-containing functional groups hydroxyl, epoxide, diol, ketone, and carboxyl, respectively [51]. After GO sheets modifying with sulfonic groups, the spectrum of GS exhibited two additional bands at 1175 and 1122 cm−1, which could be ascribed to the symmetric stretching of O]S]O in SO3H [10,52]. The emergence of new peaks confirmed the presence of SO3H groups in the GS sheets. Compared with GO and GS, the intensity of characteristic peaks of oxygen-containing groups of RGS significantly decreased or disappeared, which suggested the GO sheets were reduced by PHS. However, the peaks of RGS at 1175 and 1122 cm−1 still remained, which suggested the realization of inducing sulfonic groups on the\nnanosheets. Fig. 4 showed the UV–vis spectra of GO and surface-modified GO sheets in water. The spectrum of GO showed two characteristic peaks. The maximum absorption peak was located at 225 nm which assigned to π-π* transitions of aromatic CeC bonds. A shoulder peak at 306 nm attributed to n-π* transitions of C]O bonds [53]. After sulphonated by PASA, the maximum of GS shifted toward higher wavelength (228 nm) due to the introduction of sulfonic groups. On the other hand, after sulphonated and reduced by PHS, the maximum absorption of RGS was red shifted to 259 nm and the shoulder peak at 306 nm was disappeared, which was due to partial restoration of π network upon the reduction of GO. The results suggested the successful introduction of sulfonic groups and the surface change of the sheets after decorated by PASA and PHS.\n3.2. Characterization of self-assembled nanocomposite LB films with porphyrin\nLangmuir- Blodgett (LB) technique is considered as one of the best methods to fabricate thin films, especially for preparation of monolayer thin films with large area. The GO sheets can float on the air/ water interface due to the abundant oxygen groups on its carbon skeleton with negatively charge. Thus, the GO sheet can play an important role for preparing materials of organic dye molecules with ordered arrangement. In this work, we have further modified the GO sheets with PASA (GS) and PHS (RGS) to introduce sulfonic groups to change its surface characteristic and improve its hydrophilicity. In this system, we used porphyrin TMPyP aqueous solution as the subphase. The metalloporphyrin TMPyP is one of the earliest porphyrins that concerned by many researchers due to its potential applications in biomedical field. The positively charged porphyrin molecules could be adsorbed on the sheet-like surface through intermolecular electrostatic interaction and self-assembled into ordered structures.\nThe surface pressure-area (π-A) isotherms of GO, GS and RGS Langmuir films were shown in Fig. 5a. With the increase of surface pressure, the GO sheets floating on the aqueous subphase could form GO LB films. The isotherms of GS and RGS showed much slower increment in comparison with GO, which could be due to the enhanced hydrophilicity after introduce sulfonic groups. The final surface pressure of RGS was about 2mN/m and the molecular area for the spreading film was too small to be regarded as true monolayers. The results indicated that the good dispersion of RGS on pure water subphase made it hard to form compact LB films. On the other hand, when there existed TMPyP molecules in the subphase, obvious changes of π-A isotherms of all samples were observed, as shown in Fig. 5b. The π-A\nisotherms of GO-TMPyP composite films showed relatively high increment with phase change at a relatively low pressure, which indicated the GO sheets were easier to form Langmuir films on the porphyrin aqueous subphase. Similarly, the π-A isotherms of GS-TMPyP and RGSTMPyP exhibited much higher increment in comparison with those on pure water surface. This could be due to the reduction of electrostatic\nrepulsion between the floating sheets after absorbing the porphyrin molecules on the sheets. The partial electrostatic neutralization of GS and RGS sheets by adsorption of TMPyP on their surface made them easier to form LB films in comparison with them floating on pure water subphase. Among these films, GO-TMPyP composite films showed the largest molecular area, which might due to the large amounts of sulfonic groups on the surface of GS and RGS that improved their hydrophilicity madding it difficult to form floating films on the air/water interface.\nThe atomic force microscope (AFM) images of as prepared GO, GS and RGS composite LB films transferred onto mica surface at different surface pressure were carried out as shown in Fig. 6. With increasing the surface pressure, the morphological changes were obviously observed. At relatively low surface pressure, such as 5mM/m, the separate sheets-like structures with relatively large area were observed and the composite sheets structures were smoother and more densify with comparison of GO sheets on pure water subphase. The smooth and compact structures of GO, GS and RGS composite sheets suggested the successful introduce of TMPyP molecules on the surface of these sheets (Fig. 6a, d and g). When the surface pressure increased to 10mN/m, the sheets structures became closer and formed compact monolayer composite films. Compared with GO-TMPyP composite LB films, the films of GS and RGS nanosheets compound with porphyrin molecules were relatively loose, which indicated that the more sulfonic groups made the larger electrostatic repulsion between the surface-modified sheets structures. As the surface pressure increased to 20mN/m, the\ncomposite films of GO-TMPyP became more firmer and the separate sheets structures could not be observed directly. At relatively high surface pressure, the wrinkling became serious and the surface roughness of all composite films increased consistently. Compared with GOTMPyP monolayer films, the separate sheets structures of composite films of GS-TMPyP and RGS-TMPyP could still be observed and the surface roughness of them was lower than that of GO-TMPyP. The introduction of oxygenated functional groups and the more surface defects made the composite films of GS and RGS maintain flat and smooth at relatively high surface pressure.\nAlso, the structural difference between monolayer of GO-TMPyP films, GS-TMPyP and RGS-TMPyP composite films was characterized by TEM images in Fig. 7. When the surface pressure was 5mN/m, the GO-, GS- and RGS-TMPyP LB films showed well isolated and individual sheets structures (Fig. 7a, d, g). When the surface pressure increased to 10mN/m (Fig. 7b, e, h), the tense packing of sheets could be clearly observed. The contrast ratio of these sheets was increased which indicated the TMPyP molecules were adsorbed on the floating sheets. With increasing surface compression beyond the close-packed region, such as 20mN/m, the composite sheets squeezed with each other and\nlead to over lapping. This could be due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the oxygenated functional groups on the edges of sheets. The interaction between the sheets prevented them from sliding and formed wrinkling structures. In comparison with GO-TMPyP LB films, the transferred LB films of GS- and RGS-TMPyP were sparse. The results of transmission were consistent with those of atomic force microscopy which suggested the difference surface state containing sulfonic groups influenced the stacking of floating sheets and the aggregation of porphyrin molecules.\nIt is well known that porphyrins and metal porphyrins exist widely in nature, such as Hemoglobin, Chlorophyll and Vitamin B12 are derivatives of metalloporphyrins. The porphyrins play a very important role in the life process. In the porphyrin family, TMPyP has attracted much attention due to its good photophysical and electrochemical properties [54]. In this system, TMPyP was utilized as guest molecules dispersion in subphase to form composite LB films with GO and surface modified GO. The positively charged TMPyP dispersion in pure water subphase could be adsorbed on the negatively charged floating GO, GS and RGS sheets by electrostatic interaction at air/water interface. And the UV–vis spectra were carried out to clarify the aggregate state of\nporphyrin molecules. In pure water, the porphyrin molecules were in monomolecular state due to the electrostatic repulsion of adjacent pyridine rings with positive charge. As shown in Fig. 8, the absorption of TMPyP molecules showed strong Soret band at 422 nm which corresponded to the porphyrin B transition. The absorption of porphyrin located at 518 nm, 553 nm, 586 nm and 644 nm were corresponded to the porphyrin Q transition (Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4) [55]. The UV–vis spectra of GO-TMPyP Langmuir-Schaefer (LS) films showed B band centered at 442 nm and Q band at 531 nm (Q1), 598 nm (Q3) and 659 nm (Q4), respectively. Compared with monodisperse porphyrin, TMPyP molecules of GOTMPyP composite LS films showed obvious red-shift at B band and Q band. Also, it is worth noting that the Q2 band of GO-TMPyP composite LS films was disappear. Similarly, the UV–vis spectra of GS-TMPyP and RGS-TMPyP composite LS films also showed obvious red-shift and the reduction of Q band. The changes in absorption spectra of these composite LS films indicated the formation of J-type aggregate of porphyrin\nmolecules on the surface of floating sheets [56,57]. The appearance of four Q band absorption peaks of TMPyP molecules was due to the decreased molecular symmetry leading to the splitting of degenerate orbital energy levels. When the porphyrin molecules adsorbed on the floating sheets, the interaction between TMPyP molecules resulted in the enhancement of molecular symmetry and decreased the energy gap [58,59]. Therefore, the spectra showed the reduction of Q band after the formation of J-like packing between the neighboring porphyrin rings in the transferred films.\nMolecular self-assembly could in principle lead to red-shift absorption through J-aggregation of chromophores [60]. Compared with RGSTMPyP composite LS films, the spectra of GO-TMPyP and GS-TMPyP LS films showed more obvious red-shift indicated that the reduction of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of RGS sheets weakened the interaction between porphyrin molecules and the sheets. More significantly, the spectra of GO-TMPyP composite LS films showed the largest red-shift about 28 nm at B band, and the Q band about transition\nat 657 nm disappeared. The obvious red-shift and the decrease in the number of Q bands of GS-TMPyP composite films indicated the strong interaction between sulfonic groups modified GO sheets and TMPyP molecules, which resulted in the more ordered arrangement of porphyrin molecules. The results of UV–vis spectra of composite films confirmed that the induction of sulfonic groups and abundant oxygencontaining groups on the surface of GO sheets provided excellent platform for the aggregation of porphyrin molecules. Thus, by modifying the surface of GO sheets, the aggregation state of porphyrin molecules could be easy to regulate and control."

      "text" : "In summary, we have successfully prepared the GO and surface modified with sulfonic groups, GS and RGS sheets to construct composite films with porphyrin molecules by LB method. The successful introduction of sulfonic groups on the surface of GO sheets has been confirmed by a series of morphological and spectroscopic characterizations. After surface modified with sulfonic groups, GS and RGS sheets became soft and the hydrophilicity of the sheets were enhanced, which made it difficult to form LB films on the air/water interface. When the subphase changed to TMPyP water solution, all sheets could be easily formed LB films and provided a platform for adsorption of porphyrin molecules by electrostatic interaction and π-π stacking. Due to the strong interactions between nanosheets and porphyrin molecules, the porphyrin molecules were adsorbed on the surface of the sheets and arranged into the type of J-aggregate. Moreover, the introduction of sulfonic groups or reduction of GO sheets surface can adjust the aggregation state of the porphyrin molecules in the obtained composite LB films. This work provided easy and feasible method for regulating the aggregation of porphyrin molecules, which demonstrated some perspectives for preparing functional GO-based nanomaterials.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."
