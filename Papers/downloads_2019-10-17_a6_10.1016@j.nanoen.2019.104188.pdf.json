      "text" : "The hybrid energy harvester composed of a solar cell and a water-drop triboelectric\nnanogenerator (WD-TENG) has been reported to harvest energy from sunlight or raindrops depends on the changing natural environment. However, the reported integrated WD-TENGs always reduce the light absorption of solar cells, resulting in a decline of solar cell efficiency. Here, a bi-functional nano-wrinkled polydimethylsiloxane (nw-PDMS) film is introduced to fabricate the hybrid energy harvester, serving as both the anti-reflective layer of the solar cell and the triboelectric layer of the WD-TENG, and simultaneously enhancing the energy harvesting efficiency from sunlight and raindrop. With significantly enhanced transmittance due to the antireflective coating, the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell has improved from 12.55% to 13.57%. In addition, due to the high aspect ratio, surface fluorination and strong hydrophobicity of the nw-PDMS film, both open circuit voltage (VOC-T) and short-circuit current (ISC-T) of the WD-TENG have huge enhancement by 385.5% and 299.1%, respectively. In this work, the introducing of bi-functional nw-PDMS film provides a simple and convenient strategy for designing hybrid energy harvester with enhanced output performances, which is a general route for Si-based solar cell and other kinds of solar cells.\n2\nKeyword: triboelectric nanogenerator, raindrop energy, solar cell, nano structure, anti-reflective coating Introduction:\nThe development of clean energies is one of the effective ways to solve the current energy\ncrisis and environmental pollution problems, among which, solar cells have attracted the most attention due to their high energy conversion efficiency and pollution-free nature [1,2]. Solar cells can directly convert solar irradiated energy into electric energy without the risk of producing additional environmental pollution during the photoelectric conversion process. However, the unbalanced distribution of sunlight radiation in time and space limits the applications of solar cells in complex and changeable natural environment. For example, the electrical output performance of solar cells would be significantly deteriorated on rainy days. Therefore, developing hybrid energy harvester by combining solar cells with other energy harvester is of great practical significance for broadening the workable conditions and enhancing the efficient of energy harvesting [3-7].\nThe mechanical energies such as wind flowing and rain dropping are widely distributed in\nnatural environment [8]. In 2012, a brand-new technology converting such mechanical energy into electricity was invented by Zhong Lin Wang’s team, which is the so called triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) [9,10]. The working principle of TENG is based on the coupling of contact-electrification and electrostatic induction effect [11-17]. It can collect different kinds of mechanical energies [18] from the environment, which are always ignored by us including human motions [19,20], wind flowing [21,22], and heat [23].\nApart from the traditional contact-electrification on the solid/solid interfaces [24-28], it has\nbeen found the contact-electrification are also existed on the solid/liquid interfaces [29]. Based on this mechanism, a water-drop TENG (WD-TENG) has been developed to directly harvest the mechanical energy of water-drop into electricity [30-34]. This type of WD-TENG can collect the energy of raindrops on rainy days, which is a key complementary for the working environment of solar cells.\nFor realizing a comprehensive energy harvesting under different weather conditions, a few\nhybrid energy harvesters of solar cells and WD-TENGs have been fabricated and reported [35- 39]. For example, Zheng et al. has built a WD-TENG with nanorods array structured polytetrafluoroethylene/indium tin oxide/polyethyleneterephthalate (PTFE/ITO/PET) on the surface of solar cells, which can harvest raindrop energy and solar energy simultaneously [36].\n3\nThe WD-TENG with microbowl array structure (polydimethylsiloxane/ITO/polyethylene naphthalate) (PDMS/ITO/PEN) has been fabricated on the surface of solar cells by Choi's group, which not only realizes solar energy and raindrop energy harvesting, but also possesses the selfcleaning function for the device [37]. However, in these hybrid energy harvesters, WD-TENG were directly fabricated on the surface of solar cells, which blocked light absorption resulting in reduction of energy conversation efficiency of the solar cells [35-38]. Yoo et al. have tied to introduce an anti-reflective (AR) WD-TENG which could be directly attached onto the surface of the solar cell instead of the protective glass plate to minimize the surface light reflection, thus enhancing the solar energy conversation efficiency. However, since this WD-TENG was still directly attached on solar cell surface, its AR properties for the solar cell was limited [39]. Therefore, it is of great significance to exploring novel triboelectric layer of the WD-TENG and optimizing the structure of the hybrid energy harvester, which could collect the energy of raindrops and enhancing the light absorption of solar cells at the same time.\nDesigning an AR film with various nanostructures is one of the effective ways to reduce the\nreflective loss of incident light and improve light absorption, which has been reported in the fabrication of solar cells [40,41]. Therefore, in order to overcome the shortcoming of reduced light adsorption in the hybrid energy harvesters, we have designed and fabricated a bi-functional nw-PDMS film on the surface of a Si-based solar cell in this paper, which could serve as both triboelectric layer of WD-TENG and the anti-reflective layer of the underneath solar cell. Benefitting from its AR property, the conversion efficiency of solar cells increased from 12.55% to 13.57%. Moreover, the VOC-T and ISC-T of the WD-TENG increased by 385.5% and 299.1% respectively comparing with the device with planar PDMS (p-PDMS) film. The method proposed here provides a novel strategy for developing hybrid energy harvester with enhanced energy harvesting efficiency from both sunlight and raindrops."

      "text" : "The schematic diagram of the fabrication process of the hybrid energy harvester composed\nwith a Si-based solar cell and a WD-TENG is illustrated in Fig. 1a. The PDMS prepolymer was spin-coated onto the surface of the upper electrode (ITO electrode layer and Ag grids electrode) of Si-based solar cell followed by solidification at 60°C for 2 hrs, then nano-wrinkled structures on PDMS surface were created by RIE process. In the hybrid energy harvester, the solar cell was composed of the nw-PDMS, Ag grids and ITO transparent electrodes, Si absorption layer and Al\n4\nback electrode; the WD-TENG was composed of the nw-PDMS triboelectric layer and Ag-ITO electrodes. The nw-PDMS and Ag-ITO electrodes were shared in both solar cell and WD-TENG. Two RIE steps were involved for preparing the bi-functional hydrophobicity nw-PDMS film. Firstly, nano-wrinkled structures on the PDMS surface was created by oxygen plasma etching. As shown in Fig. 1b and 1c, a series of nano-wrinkled structures with feature size from 200 nm to 550 nm were uniformly distributed on the surface (surface roughness: 46.7 nm). At this stage, the water contact angle (θCA) of the film was 74.7° (as shown in the insert of Fig. 1c) which was not ideal for energy harvesting of the WD-TENG. According to the working mechanism of WDTENG, hydrophobicity is a requisite condition for effective separation of water droplets from the surface of triboelectric layer, leading to an improved electrical output performance of WD-TENG [35]. As a result of the first RIE step, plenty of hydroxyl and other oxygen functional groups were introduced to the surface of the PDMS film, so the surface energy was enhanced resulting in a hydrophilic surface. In order to change the surface into hydrophobic, the nw-PDMS film was fluorinated by CF4, O2 and Ar (6:3:2) mixed gases during the second RIE process, which could lower the surface energy of PDMS film retaining the similar nano-wrinkled structures (Fig.1d). Indeed, the θCA of the PDMS film was enlarged to 138° (the insert of Fig. 1d) after fluorination treatment. Apart from lowering surface energy by fluorination treatment, the nano-wrinkled structure on PDMS surface is another reason for the large contact angle. According to Wenzel equation [42]:\nθγ γγθ cos)(cos w r r lv slsv =−= …………..……….. (1)\n(r is the roughness of the film surface; γsv, γsl, γlv is surface tension in solid-gas interface,\nsolid-liquid interface, gas-liquid interface, respectively), for the film surface with intrinsic hydrophobicity, the hydrophobicity will be stronger when the surface roughness r is larger.\nTo investigate the AR performance of the nw-PDMS film, UV-vis transmittance spectra\nhave been employed for p-PDMS and nw-PDMS coated ITO glasses and bare ITO glass as control. As illustrated in the Fig. 2a, the transmission of the bare ITO glass substrate is lower than that of the p-PDMS coated ITO glass in entire visible light range, which could be attributed to the introduction of a thin layer of PDMS with a refractive index of 1.43, forming a gradual refractive index distribution between ITO (nITO=1.82) and air (nair=1.0) [43]. Furthermore, while bring up the nano-wrinkled structures on the surface of PDMS, the transmittance at 450 nm is further enhanced to 88% that could be attributed to both continuous linear gradient in effective\n5\nrefractive index and diffuse reflection caused by the nanostructure [44]. Moreover, the reflectance spectra of bare, p-PDMS coated and nw-PDMS coated solar cells are demonstrated in Fig. S1 which revealing the anti-reflctive effect of the p-PDMS and nw-PDMS films from another point of view. Moreover, in order to study the influence of the transmittance characteristics of nw-PDMS as an AR coating layer on the solar cell performance, the solar weighted transmittance (SWT), which is the ratio of the usable photons transmitted to the total usable photons, is estimated. The SWT can be evaluated by the transmittance spectra of the solar spectral photon flux over the wavelength range of 320-800 nm. The SWT is calculated from the following equation [45]:\nλλ\nλλλ\nd)(\nd)()( SWT ∫ ∫= S S I TI …………..……….. (2)\nwhere IS (λ) is the solar spectral photon flux (i.e., AM 1.5G) and T (λ) is the total\ntransmittance in Fig. 2a. As expected, for nw-PDMS/ITO, the SWT (88.70%) is higher than that of the bare ITO glass (85.76%) and the p-PDMS/ITO (87.40%).\nOptical photographs of bare, p-PDMS and nw-PDMS coated solar cells are presented in\ninset of Fig. 2b. From a visual inspection of three devices, p-PDMS and nw-PDMS coated solar cells both turned into highly absorbing darker materials compared to the bare solar cell, due to their AR function. The current density-voltage (J-V) curves of solar cells with various coating have been characterized, the results are shown in Fig. 2b and the detailed electrical output characteristics are summarized in Table 1. As illustrated, the bare solar cell without any AR coating exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.55%, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 36.73 mA/cm2, and an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.56 V. Meanwhile, JSC of p-PDMS coated solar cell is slightly increased to 38.10 mA/cm2. This is due to suppress light reflectance loss by the gradual refractive index distribution between air and ITO. The solar cell with nw-PDMS AR coating exhibits a remarkable enhanced JSC of 40.7 mA/cm 2 that is nine percent more than the intrinsic solar cell. Therefore, the PCE of nw-PDMS coated solar cell improves from 12.55% (bare solar cell) to 13.57%. All these enhancements could be attributed to the AR properties induced by nw-PDMS coating layer on the upper electrode of the Si-based solar cell that could enhance the captured light inside the active layer of Si-based solar cell. We have tested 10 devices and the results have been summarized in Fig. S2. As shown in the figure, all the tested devices have enhanced PCEs while assembled with additional nw-PDMS AR coatings.\n6\nAccording to the working principle of solar cells, the incidence angle of sunlight has a\ncrucial influence on the overall performance of solar cells. Therefore, omnidirectional lightharvesting capability is meaningful for the development of all-weather solar cells. Fig. 2c reveals the electrical characterizations of three kinds of solar cells at different incident angles. Apparently, JSC declines with the increasing light incident angle, owing to illumination more reflection loss with incident angle increases. However, JSC of nw-PDMS coated solar cell drops slower than the other two devices. For instance, when the located angle increases to 60 degrees, JSC of nw-PDMS coated solar cell, p-PDMS coated solar cell, and bare solar cell decreases to 62%, 55%, and 53% of the original value, respectively, revealing a weak angle dependent behavior of the nw-PDMS coated solar cell. This is due to the better AR performance induced by the nw-PDMS coating layer, which could reduce the reflection loss of the incident light [46]. Normalized PCEs of all three kinds of solar cells as a function of θi are provided in Fig. S3 which further confirms this point. Fig. 2d shows the trend of VOC with different rotation angles. All the VOC of three different solar cells are almost unchanged with the changing of rotation angles. This is because that the VOC is independent on the intensity of adsorbed light. Comparing with other reported hybrid energy harvester [35-38], performance enhancement instead of efficiency decay is realized in current study with the introduction of nw-PDMS coating layer, which matched well with our expectation to enlarge the working conditions of the solar cells without reducing the energy conversion efficiency.\nFor better understanding the enhanced performance of the solar cells, the incident light\noptical paths of bare solar cell and nw-PDMS coated solar cell are simulated by using FiniteDifference Time-Domain (FDTD). As shown in Fig. 3a (bare solar cell) and 3b (nw-PDMS coated solar cell), the field intensity (|E|) of the absorbed light in the Si absorption layer of nwPDMS coated solar cell is clearly enhanced than the bare one. At the same time, |E| of the reflected light in the air is greatly reduced. The calculated results accord well with the total transmittance spectra in Fig. 2a and have been explained with the AR property induced by the nw-PDMS coating layer [47]. The cross-section profiles of |E| with a fixed y position (y=-0.021 µm, inside the Si absorption layer of solar cell) are shows in Fig. 3c. The results indicate the light absorption inside the solar cells has a sharp enhancement right underneath the features of the nanostructures on PDMS surface. To sum up, both experimental and simulated results demonstrate that the introduction of nw-PDMS coating layer could reduce the reflection of incident light, resulting in the stronger light absorption and better output performance of the solar\n7\ncell. Based on these results, an illustration is provided in Fig. 3d for better understanding the incident light optical paths for bare and nw-PDMS coated solar cells. When a beam of parallel light irradiates on the surface of nw-PDMS film, the reflected light can be effectively reduced due to a continuous linear gradual refractive index between the air, nw-PDMS and ITO. In addition, the nano-wrinkled structures also enhance the surface roughness leading to multiple reflections of incident light, facilitating the recollection of the secondary reflection of the light. This is because that the nano-wrinkled trench extends the effective optical path length due to the multiple scattering and reflection of the light between the nw-PDMS grooves. Thus, the probability of photons traveling through the nw-PDMS layer is increased, rather than escaping back into the air [48].\nTo collect the raindrop energy on rainy days, a WD-TENG is built on the surface of Si-\nbased solar cell. Fig. 4a illustrates the schematic diagram of the working mechanism of the WDTENG, which is based on a sequential process of contact-electrification and electrostatic induction at solid-liquid interface. When a water droplet is dripping and sliding on the triboelectric layer of PDMS film, triboelectricity will be generated resulting in the charged water droplet and PDMS film. The PDMS layer would get electrons and negatively charged. Meanwhile, the surface of the water droplet would be positively charges. Because of the insulation characters of PDMS, the tribo-charge would remain for a long time on its surface (Fig. 4a <I>). When subsequent water droplets are falling to contact with PDMS thin film, the positive ions from the water droplets would be attracted to screen the negative tribo-charges on the PDMS film, and a positive potential difference is established between the ITO electrode and the ground. In the short-circuit case, electrons will flow from the ground to ITO electrode, and consequently generate an instant positive current until reaching a new potential equilibrium (Fig. 4a <II>). When the water droplet leaving the PDMS film, the potential difference between the ITO and ground would be reformed by the negative tribo-charge carried by PDMS, which drives the electrons flowing from the ITO electrode to the ground until reaching potential equilibrium (Fig. 4a <III>). Under such working mechanism, continuous AC output could be generated between the ITO electrode and the ground with water droplets contacting and leaving PDMS film periodically [49].\nElectrical output characteristics from the WD-TENG with p-PDMS and nw-PDMS are\nmeasured. The distance between the water droplet and PDMS film surface is 50 cm, and the volume of water droplet is 109 µL. The results are shown in Fig. 4b and 4c. The peak of short-\n8\ncircuit ISC-T of the WD-TENG with nw-PDMS (about 32.0 µA) is 299.1% of that with p-PDMS (about 10.7 µA). The peak of open-circuit voltage (VOC-T) of the WD-TENG with nw-PDMS (about 29.3 V) is 385.5% of that with p-PDMS (about 7.6 V). Therefore, we could conclude that the WD-TENG with nw-PDMS displays superior electric output compared to that with p-PDMS, which is attributed to its larger surface area and stronger hydrophobicity [50,51]. The output performance of our WD-TENG has been compared with a few recent reported hybrid energy harvesters and the results have been summarized in Table S1 revealing the superior performance of the WD-TENG.\nSuch a WD-TENG is designed aiming to work together with practical solar cells, so the\ninfluence of tilt angle (θ) on the output performance of WD-TENG is highly worth investigating, where θ is the angle between the ground and the device surface. Fig. 4d and 4e show the measured ISC-T and VOC-T of the WD-TENG with nw-PDMS at different angles ranging from 15º to 75º, respectively. With the increase of θ, ISC-T and VOC-T first increase linearly until θ reaches 45º, then decrease linearly with the increase of θ. When θ increases from 15º to 45º, the ISC-T and VOC-T increase from 3.0 µA and 9.8 V to 30.9 µA and 28.9 V, respectively. With a small angle of 15°, the water-drop on the TENG surface could not rapidly flow away from PDMS surface, which hinders the generation and separation of tribo-charges. This phenomenon would be improved with the increase of θ, the ISC-T and VOC-T boost with the increase of θ, and reach the maximum at 45°. Thereafter, the effective contact area between water-drop and PDMS film decreases with θ, leading to lower ISC-T and VOC-T. The experimental results here reveal that WDTENG should be fixed at a certain tilted angle (around 45°) to obtain the best output performance.\nIn practical application, solar cells are also installed at a certain tilted angle to maximize the output performance, which is determined by the latitude of location [52], indicating that favorable integration capability of the WD-TENG with solar cells in practical application purpose. Moreover, the WD-TENG performed well even after storing for 12 months in the ambient condition indicating the excellent stability of the device (Fig. S4).\nTo comprehensively characterize the WD-TENG as a power supply, the output voltages and\ncurrents on varied load resistances have been measured, and the results are summarized in Fig. 5a. The output current drops at larger external resistances, while the output voltage across the load exhibits a reversed tendency. Accordingly, the power provided by the WD-TENG first rises at low resistance region and then declines at high resistance region, showing a maximum value of 453.4 µW at the load resistance of 1 MΩ, as shown in Fig. 5b. In order to study the output of the\n9\nhybrid energy harvester, an energy collection circuit is designed as illustrated in Fig. 5c. The electrical outputs of both solar cell and WD-TENG are collected in a capacitor. The direct current generated by solar cells charges the capacitor (3.3 µF) directly, and the low frequency alternating current generated by WD-TENG is added to the capacitor through a rectifier bridge. A blocking diode is employed to avoid the direct connection beween the ITO electrode and the ground when the WD-TENG is working. The advantage of this system is that the solar cell and WD-TENG can work simultaneously without switching manually between the solar cell and WD-TENG, which facilitize the application of the hybrid energy harvester in practical purpose [5]. In order to overcome the high threshold voltage of the two diodes in series, two solar cells were connected in series to charge a capacitor. The charging curve of the capacitor that contains 5 cycles is shown in Fig. 5d, which inclues two charging stage. At the first charging stage (pink-shaded area), the capacitor is charged to 0.8 V within 5.8 s, which is mainly attributed to the Si solar cell due to its higher output current. In the second stage (green-shaded area), the voltage of the capacitor increases further from 0.8 V to 3.1 V, which is attributed to the WD-TENG. It should be noted that, in the second stage, the solar cell does not contribute to the changing of the capacitor due to its raletively low VOC-T, which could be compesated by the raletively high VOC-T (about 29.3 V) of WD-TENG. This two-stage charging process has taken the complementary advantages of solar cell and WD-TENG in the hybrid energy harvester. Moreover, the integrating system displays good stability and repeatability."

However, the reported integrated WD-TENGs always reduce the light absorption of solar cells, resulting in a decline of solar cell efficiency. Here, a bi-functional nano-wrinkled polydimethylsiloxane (nw-PDMS) film is introduced to fabricate the hybrid energy harvester, serving as both the anti-reflective layer of the solar cell and the triboelectric layer of the WD-TENG, and simultaneously enhancing the energy harvesting efficiency from sunlight and raindrop. With significantly enhanced transmittance due to the antireflective coating, the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell has improved from 12.55% to 13.57%. In addition, due to the high aspect ratio, surface fluorination and strong hydrophobicity of the nw-PDMS film, both open circuit voltage (VOC-T) and short-circuit current (ISC-T) of the WD-TENG have huge enhancement by 385.5% and 299.1%, respectively. In this work, the introducing of bi-functional nw-PDMS film provides a simple and convenient strategy for designing hybrid energy harvester with enhanced output performances, which is a general route for Si-based solar cell and other kinds of solar cells.",
