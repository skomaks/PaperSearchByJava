      "text" : "Recently, a great consideration has been taken and focused to find extremely competent electronic materials for cooling applications [1–3], as well as magnetic and power generations [4–6]. As published in literatures, several electronic materials such as NaCoO2 [7], Sr1−xLaxTiO3 [8], Ca0.8Dy0.2MnO3 [9] or Nd1−xCaxCoO3 [10] have been prepared and exhibited significant electrical and thermal properties. Nowadays, nanostructure perovskite-manganites doped with metals have showed a large attention due to their non-toxicity, chemicalstability and low-production cost with opportunity of being applied at high temperature. They have the general formula LnxA1-xMnO3, where Ln is a trivalent rare-earth metal as La, Ce, Nd, Gd, Sm and A is a divalent alkaline earth metal as Ca, Sr, Ba, and Pb. The electrical properties of perosvkite-type oxides are related to their stoichiometry and composition. A significant variation has been detected when the degree of replacement for La with alkali-earth element is varied from 0.0 to 50% [8]. Manganites exhibit a transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic states [11-12], i.e. insulator-metal transition is happened after substitution of Ln with divalent alkaline-earth due to the formation of mixed Mn3+/Mn4+ ions. The common methods employed for\npreparation of LaxA1-xMnO3 micro- or nano-particles are solid state reaction, sol-gel and co-precipitation [13]. These techniques have some drawbacks, for example; the solid-state method requires high sintering temperature ranged from 1250 to 1400 K with soaking time>12 h to obtain homogenous stoichiometric composition with suitable grain size and porosity. Also, the sol-gel method requires a complicated chemical steps with sensitive conditions. It is a higher cost technique with low yield [14]. Recently, mechanical-activation or mechanical-milling has been reported as a new method for preparing of perovskite manganites by mixing of manganese oxides, alkaline-earths and rare-earth oxides [15–17]. This procedure depends mainly on mechanical activation of raw mixture by high energy ball milling to induce chemical reactions between the component reactants. The advantages of this method are including high yield (preferable for industry), low-cost, low temperature synthesis and the effectiveness for synthesis of nanoparticles oxides [18–28].\nNaturally, manganese present as pyrolusite (MnO2) which is stable in alkaline and acidic media. So, the recovering of manganese from its source has to be occurred under suitable reducing conditions [29–31]. In traditional technologies, coal can be used as reducing agent in the presence of sulfuric acid to produce manganese oxide, but this method\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.056 Received 17 September 2019; Received in revised form 6 October 2019; Accepted 7 October 2019\n∗ Corresponding author.

Also, this method requires high reaction temperature [32]. Various reducing agents as pyrite, aqueous sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen peroxide have been used conventionally under different acidic media but they might be harmful. So, many studies have been focused on using organic reducing agents, mainly carbohydrates such as oxalic acid, methanol, sucrose and lactose [33–38]. These methods were efficient and simple under mild conditions i.e. temperature (< 80 °C) [39]. Belyi et al., (2006), used sulfuric acid approach for leaching of manganese ore under varying reaction conditions [40]. Ismail et al. (2004) studied the leaching of low grade manganese ores using either sawdust or lactose as effective reducing agents in acid medium [41] with successful results.\nThe present study focuses on leaching of nano MnO2 for the Egyptian manganese ore. Afterward, the production of LaxCa1-xMnO3 and LaxSr1-xMnO3 (x=0.1- 0.3- 0.5 and 1) perovskites nano particles using the leached MnO2 is also the main goal of the current work. The proposed perovskites are prepared by mechanical activation technique of relevant oxides followed by sintering at different temperatures. Investigation of prepared powders and sintered bodies is also aimed in the present study."

La0.1Sr0.9MnO3 is highly agglomerated than La0.1Ca0.9MnO3 perovskite.

With increasing of the calcium content, the peaks are shifted to lower 2θ values. This\nmeans that the unit cell volume increases gradually with decreasing of the calcium percentage. This is attributed to the differences between the ionic radii of Mn4+ and Mn3+ and size variances between the La3+ and Ca2+. Mn4+ is formed due to the replacement of Ca or Sr to keep the neutrality of the system with the formation of oxygen vacancies.\nFig. 9 displays XRD patterns of LaMnO3, La0.1Sr0.9MnO3, La0.3Sr0.7MnO3 and La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 pervoskites sintered at 1350 °C.

The peaks of perovskite phases are slightly shifted to lower 2θ values, indicating the fractional substitution of La by Sr. The systematic shift in the peaks position of perovskites is owing to differences between the ionic radii of Mn4+ and Mn3+, the size differences between the La3+ and Sr2+ ions and their\nFig. 3.

It has been described that when Ca2+ is doped at the expanse of La3+site in La-based materials; the crystalstructure is probable to be orthorhombic, while when it is doped with Sr2+, the material is probable to be converted into rhombohedral perovskite and in all case in single phase is formed [13,44,45]."

      "heading" : "3.2.4. Physical properties of sintered perovskites",
      "text" : "The perovskite manganite-materials are ceramic in nature.\nConsequently, porosity and density are the utmost significant parameters which determine the whole properties of sintered manganites. Thus, to develop and increase the mechanical properties of ceramic materials, it is necessary to recognize the relationship between porosity and bulk density. Fig. 10 shows apparent porosity and bulk density of LaMnO3, La0.1Ca0.9MnO3, La0.3Ca0.7MnO3 and La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 perovskites sintered at 1100, 1250 and 1350 °C. As indicated in the figure, the porosity decreases with increasing the temperature up to 1350 °C. Also, it increases with increasing the concentration of calcium. It is worth mentioning that the samples were deformed when the sintering was conducted at higher than 1350 °C. At 1350 °C, their values are in the range between 6-12%. On the other side, the bulk density goes in an opposite trend of the apparent porosity. The reduction of porosity with rising the temperature is attributed to grain-grain interaction with the possibility of liquid phases' formation that produced from the low melting materials. At the same temperature, the density of LaMnO3 is higher than La0.1Ca0.9MnO3, La0.3Ca0.7MnO3 and La0.5Ca0.5MnO3. This is attributed to the higher theoretical density of LaMnO3 (6.52 g/cm3)\nin comparison with that of CaMnO3 (4.58 g/cm3). The substitution of La (ionic radius 1.032 Å) by Ca (1.00 Å) leads to decreasing the lattice parameters with shrinkage of the lattice and formation of smaller unit cell. Also, the replacement of La by Ca tends to conversion of Mn+3 ion (ionic radii, 0.645 Å) into Mn+4(ionic radii, 0.53 Å) with formation of one mobile hole [14] which consequently helps in reduction of unit cell size and density. Fig. 11 depicts apparent porosity and bulk density of LaMnO3, La0.1Sr0.9MnO3, La0.3Sr0.7MnO3 and La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 perovskites sintered at 1250, 1350 and 1400 °C. In this case, the behavior is similar for that of calcium-containing perovskites except the sintering temperature is reached to 1400 °C. This means that strontium-containing perovskites need higher sintering temperature than calciumcontaining perovskites due to the higher melting temperature of SrMnO3 (1740 °C) than CaMnO3 (1500 °C). At the 1350 °C, the values of density are higher for calcium-containing perovskites than strontiumcontaining perovskites in spite of the lesser theoretical density of CaMnO3 (4.58 g/cm3) than that of SrMnO3 (5.42 g/cm3)."

It is indicated that the electrical resistivity of LaMnO3 is higher than both LaxCa1-xMnO3 and LaxCa1-xMnO3 perovskites. It also decreases with the increase of Ca or Sr amounts in the perovskites. Moreover, the perovskites that contain Ca exhibit higher resistivity than those contain Sr. LaMnO3 is an intrinsic p-type semiconductor having relatively high resistivity. When La3+ ion is replaced by lower oxidation sate metalions like Sr2+ or Ca2+, this leads to increasing the oxidation state of Mn3+ ion [46] in B-site or generating of an electron-hole in the same site. This is to preserve electro neutrality situation.

It is clear that magnetization of perovskites doped with Ca and Sr are higher than that of pure LaMnO3. Also, the optimum magnetization is obtained when the value of Ca or Sr is x= 0.5 (i.e. La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 and La0.5Ca0.5MnO3). When the amounts of Ca or Sr are increased into 0.7 and 0.9, the magnetization is decreased again. The magnetic behavior of prepared perovskite phases is primarily affected by the variation of Mn4+ content which is controlled by neutrality mechanism (La3++Mn3+/O2−/A2++Mn4+), i.e. it depends on double exchange mechanism between Mn3+ and Mn4+ which induced due to substitution of divalent cations, and consequently depends on the mobility of eg electrons and the ratio of Mn3+/Mn4+. Also, the applied magnetic-field makes delocalization of charge carriers, which in turn destroys the resistivity producing local arrangement of the magnetic spins. Owing to this ordering, the ferromagnetic-metallic state might destroy the paramagnetic insulating regime causing complete polarization of conduction electrons (e1g) inside the magnetic-domains and being easily transferred between Mn3+ and Mn4+\nvia oxygen that introducing holes into the this material. The holes permit charge-transfer in the eg state which is greatly hybridized with the oxygen-2p-state. The produced oxygen deficiency and holes in the lattice form oxygen-vacant superstructure which lead to domination of super exchange interaction between Mn3+–O–Mn3+ leading to the enhancement of ferromagnetic properties [48]. The perovskites that contain Sr have higher magnetization than LaMnO3 and perovskites that contain Ca, this because the Ca ion has asmaller size than Sr ion.

    "abstractText" : "The present study focuses on the leaching of MnO2 form manganese ore by acid leaching method using glucose as a reducing agent. The leached MnO2 was used to prepare nano LaxCa1-xMnO3 and LaxSr1-xMnO3 (x=0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 1) perovskites by mechanical activation method in the presence of La2O3, CaO or SrO. The leached MnO2 and synthesized perovskite powders were investigated by x-ray diffraction technique (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM).The prepared LaxCa1-xMnO3 and LaxSr1-xMnO3 perovskites were subjected for sintering up to 1350 and 1400 °C, respectively. The physical, electrical and magnetic properties as well as microstructure of sintered perovskites were investigated. The results showed that MnO2 was successfully leached and utilized for preparation of nano LaxCa1-xMnO3 and LaxSr1-xMnO3 perovskites after milling for 8 h. LaxCa(1x)MnO3 was sintered at 1350 °C while LaxSr(1-x)MnO3 was sintered 1400 °C. The doping with Ca and Sr led to decreasing the electrical resistivity, while they led improving the magnetic property until specific limit (x= 0.5) after which magnetic property was decreased again with increasing their amounts. The highest magnetization was obtained for La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 and La0.5Sr0.5MnO3. In all cases, their values were higher than that of pure LaMnO3.",
