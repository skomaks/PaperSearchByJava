      "text" : "During the past few decades, the usage of natural fibers as a substitute for synthetic fibers as reinforcement has increased due to their eco-friendly, and renewable nature, lightweight, and easy feasibility (Bhuvaneshwaran et al. 2019; Cai et al. 2016; Efendy and Le 2016; Patel and Dhanola 2016; Swain, Ranjan, and Biswas 2017). Generally, the disposal of synthetic polymer composites is very difficult and in many countries, the use of plastic has been banned (Durowaye et al. 2018). So, the need for using natural fibers as an alternative for synthetic fibers in various fields has increased nowadays (Cai et al. 2016). Hence, many natural fibers like sisal, (Ramesh, Palanikumar, and Hemachandra Reddy 2013) jute, (Boopalan, Niranjanaa, and Umapathy 2013; Braga and Magalhaes 2015; Sathishkumar et al. 2018; Swain, Ranjan, and Biswas 2017) coir, (Harish et al. 2009; Yan et al. 2016) flax,(Huner 2018; Prasad, Joseph, and Sekar 2018; Srinivasan et al. 2014) bamboo (Gupta 2019), etc., were used by many researchers as reinforcements for making natural fiber polymer composites. Generally, the natural fibers are of the lignocellulose type and they tend to absorb moisture so that they are used in many interior applications like furniture, packing, and vibration isolators (Anbukarasi and Kalaiselvam 2015). The drawbacks of using natural fibers as reinforcement are their poor adhesion with the matrix due to the water-absorbing nature of the fiber and hydrophobic nature of the matrix (Yan et al. 2016). Due to this, a weak fiber-matrix interface is formed, and it reduces the reinforcing behavior of the fiber, which inhibits the transfer of stress from the matrix to the load-carrying fibers (Sepe et al. 2018). The properties of natural fiber polymer composites depend mainly on the degree of bonding between the fibers and the matrix (Mohanta and Acharya 2015). In order to overcome the\nCONTACT K. G. Ashok ashok6733@gmail.com Department of Mechanical Engineering, Easwari Engineering College, Chennai-600089, Tamil Nadu, India\n© 2020 Taylor & Francis\nabove problems, several methods were investigated by researches to improve the fiber properties and to increase the fiber matrix interaction. Generally, for modifying the properties of fibers, chemical treatments were used commonly used chemical treatments are alkali, silane,peroxide, permanganate, and isocyanate treatments, and polymer coupling agent (Huner 2018; Chen et al. 2018; Bachtiar, Sapuan, and Hamdan 2008; Mohanta and Acharya 2016; Siqueira and Botaro 2013). Cai et al. (2016) reported that the fibers treated with 5% NaOH had shown optimum results in tensile strength and Young’s modulus compared to untreated fibers, and also improved interfacial shear strength with an epoxy. Libo Yan et al., (Yan et al. 2016) reported that alkali treatment with 5 wt. % NaOH solution developed a clearer and rougher surface of the coir fiber, compared with the untreated fiber surface, and also they found that the 5 wt. % NaOH solution increased the tensile strength by (+17.8%) and modulus (+6.9%), flexural strength (+16.7%) and modulus (+7.4%) effectively with untreated fibers. Therefore, in the present study, Luffa fibers were chemically treated with 5 wt. % NaOH solution for 1 hr to increase the compatibility of the luffa fiber with the matrix.\nThe other method to enhance the properties of natural fiber composites was the addition of filler materials to a matrix (Gupta 2019; Karthik Babu et al. 2018; Manimaran et al. 2018; Nikmatin et al. 2017; Prasad, Joseph, and Sekar 2018; Soundhar and Kandasamy 2019; Vinod, Vijay, and Lenin Singaravelu 2017) and it has proved to be an alternative source for enhancing the properties of natural fiber reinforced composites. The proper selection of the matrix, filler, and the reinforcement can make a composite material with good properties or even better properties than the conventional metallic materials (Sathishkumar et al. 2018). The demand for using particulate filler materials with polymer materials has increased nowadays in industrial and structural applications (Srivabut, Ratanawilai, and Hiziroglu 2018). The addition of fillers with polymers is to improve the processing properties, stiffness, and strength of the polymer matrix composites (Alamri and Low 2012; Boopalan, Niranjanaa, and Umapathy 2013; Srivabut, Ratanawilai, and Hiziroglu 2018). To overcome the limitations of polymers like low stiffness, low strength, and also to use them in various applications, inorganic particulate fillers, such as SiO2 (Abenojar et al. 2017), Al2O3(Patel and Dhanola 2016; Swain, Ranjan, and Biswas 2017), graphite (Hulugappa, Achutha, and Suresha 2016; Shalwan and Yousif 2014), TiO2(Prasad, Joseph, and Sekar 2018), fly ash(Sathishkumar et al. 2018) and graphene(Ganapathy et al. 2019) particles are often modified with the matrix for making polymer composites. Swain, Ranjan, and Biswas (2017) found that the mechanical properties and interlaminar shear strength of the composites increased with the addition of the filler Al2O3. Nikmatin et al. (2017) reported that the addition of rattan fillers of 5 wt.% improves the surface morphology and hardness of the composites better than the synthetic fibers. Prasad, Joseph, and Sekar (2018) reported that a good dispersion of nanoparticles in the matrix develops a good fiber-matrix interface and minimizes the crack propagation in polymer composites. Abenojar et al. (2017) reported that more amounts of nanoparticles affect the curing process and glass transient temperature of polymer composites. Özdemir et al. (2018) reported that the incorporation of nano lead oxide with synthetic elastomer, Ethylene propylene diene monomer polymer (EPDM) increases the thermal, mechanical and radiation properties of polymer matrix composites. However, Özdemir et al. (2018) work is limited to investigating the effect of nanofiller lead oxide on elastomer materials. In addition to that, few work has been reported on the effect of lead oxide nano fillers on the behaviour of polymer matrix composite. On the other hand, lead oxide filler grabbed the attention due to its significant properties like radiation shielding, thermal, structural, dielectric, and good compatibility with other materials (Bagheri et al. 2018). Thus, there is scope to improve the properties of natural fiber composite material by modifying matrix with nanolead oxide filler. In that perspective, the present work, attempts to study the effect of nanofiller lead oxide on the physical, thermal, mechanical, water absorption and morphological behaviour of luffa natural fiber composite fabricated via hand layup followed by compression molding method. Morphological characterization is performed on the fractured surface of tensile, flexural,\nand impact test samples to analyze the contribution made by the filler lead oxide to the fibermatrix interface."

As compared with other natural fibers like sisal, banana fibers, etc., Luffa Cylindrica fiber has a layer of thick peel outside the fruit and the inner side of the fruit consists of sponge gourd. The fibers in the inner sponge gourd are arranged in the form of a multidirectional array and it resembles a natural mat structure (Premalatha et al. 2019; Siqueira and Botaro 2013). The length of a luffa sponge is around 15 to 25 cm. The content of cellulose in the luffa fiber varies from 55–90 wt. %, the content of lignin in luffa fiber varies from 10–23 wt. %, and the content of hemicelluloses in luffa fiber varies from 8–22 wt. %. The luffa fiber has extractive and ash content of 3.2 and 0.4 Wt.% (Anbukarasi and Kalaiselvam 2015; Daniel-Mkpume et al. 2019). The luffa fibers were cleaned with water and dried in sunlight for two days to remove the wax and lignin content from the fiber, the dried fiber is shown in Figure 1(a) . After drying, the fiber was cut in the form of the mat-like structure shown in Figure 1(b). The available luffa fiber is hydrophilic, and for changing the nature of the fiber from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, alkali treatment was done on the surface of the luffa fiber. The alkali treatment was performed with 5% NaOH for the removal of the moisture content, and waxy substances from the fiber. During this process, first, the fiber in the form of a mat-like structure was immersed in a beaker containing a 5% NaOH solution. After 1 hr, the immersed fiber was washed with water for the removal of the sticking sodium hydroxide from the surface of the fiber. Further, it was neutralized with the addition of dilute acetic acid and again, the fiber was washed with water. The treated fiber was dried in an oven at a temperature of 353 K. The filler material lead oxide size of 50 µm was procured from P.H.Gandhi Pvt.Ltd (Chennai, India). Then the filler was resized in the VB ceramic consultant (Chennai, India) using the ball milling process to dimensions of size 20 nm. The Epoxy resin (LY566) and the Hardener (HY-951) were purchased from (Tech Nova Enterprises, Chennai)."

      "text" : "Figure 5: shows the variations in the tensile strength of the laminated composites with and without lead oxide. The tensile test was conducted on the luffa fiber composite and PbO filled luffa fiber composite samples to understand the tensile strength and to know the contribution made by the nano lead oxide particles. The results show that 1.25 wt. % PbO added epoxy composite with luffa fiber as reinforcement yielded the maximum tensile strength values of 15.392 MPa. The percentage increase in tensile strength with the addition of 1.25 wt. % PbO in the luffa fiber-reinforced composite was 57.67% when compared to luffa fiber-reinforced composites without the nanofiller PbO addition (6.48 MPa). It was observed that when the fiber load was increased, the tensile strength decreased and it is mainly due to the poor adhesion between the matrix and the fiber. The addition of nanofiller influences the variations in the tensile strength of the laminated composites and this is due to the good dispersion of filler in the matrix attained by mechanical stirring. This results in good bonding between the fiber and the matrix, and due to this effective stress transfer takes place between the fiber and the matrix. The addition of the filler may minimize the free spaces and thereby increase the stiffness of the fabricated laminates. The filler may act as a link between the matrix and reinforced fiber, resulting in better fibermatrix interaction. When the load was applied, the stress can be easily transferred from the polymer matrix to the reinforcing fiber increasing the tensile strength. The addition of nanoparticles beyond 1.25 wt. % decreases the tensile strength, and it may be due to an increase in the filler causing more particle to particle interaction rather than causing the nanoparticles to interact with the fiber and the matrix. An increase in the filler content may increase the micro-spaces between the filler and the matrix; the agglomeration of particles causes improper dispersion of the nanofiller with a matrix that may weaken the filler-matrix interfacial bonding and thereby reduce the tensile strength of the fabricated laminates.\nMicrograph inference on tensile tested specimens\nThe fractured surface of the tested tensile samples was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope for evaluating the fiber failure and interfacial bonding between the matrix and the fiber. Figure 6(a,b) shows the micrograph images of nanofiller PbO and alkali-treated luffa fiber. Figure 6(c–h) shows the micrograph images of tensile tested composite samples with nanofiller in the matrix from 0 wt. % to 6.25 wt. %. From the Micrograph images, it is inferred that the strength of the polymer composite depends highly on the fiber-matrix interface bonding. From Figure 6(c), it is clear that the fiber-matrix interface for the composite with 0 wt. % filler shows severe fiber pull-outs and voids, which results in poor bonding, minimum strength, and poor fiber-matrix interface of the composite sample C1. From Figure 6(d), it is evident that the addition of nanofiller PbO in the matrix shows an improvement in the fiber-matrix interface. Improvement in fiber-matrix bonding was observed in the case of 1.25 wt. % of PbO in the matrix. Minimum fiber pullout is observed in sample C2 which shows better interfacial bonding between the fiber and the matrix. This supports transferring the load from the matrix to the fiber and causing the strength to increase. Figure 6(e–h) shows the fractured surfaces of 2.5, 3.75, 5, and 6.25 wt. % of nanofiller PbO added luffa fiber-reinforced composites and from the micrograph images, it is clear that a few regions of fiber pull out were spotted and this is due to the agglomeration of nano PbO particles at higher weight percentage. This will restrict the interaction of the nanoparticles with the matrix fiber interface. The higher weight percentage of filler PbO causes the particle to particle interactions and more pull out of fibers from the surfaces and this may lead to the poor mechanical strength of the fabricated laminates."

Due to this factor, a weak fiber-matrix interface was formed and it reduces the reinforcing behavior of the fiber, and also it lacks the transfer of stress from the matrix to the loadbearing fibers. To overcome this problem, the filler lead oxide was added in different wt.% with the matrix and it is inferred that the laminated composite C2 shows the maximum flexural strength of 42.44 MPa, The increase in strength may be due to the good dispersion of the filler PbO nanoparticles in the matrix causing good interfacial bonding between the matrix and the fiber, and this may effectively transfer the load from the matrix to fiber, which may delay crack propagation and increase the flexural strength of the composites.\nMicrograph inference from the flexural tested specimens\nThe fractured surface of the flexural tested samples was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope for evaluating the interfacial bonding of the fiber-matrix.

The increase in the mechanical properties may be because the filler transmits and allows a uniform stress distribution from the continuous matrix phase to the dispersed fiber phase resulting in higher strength. ● Even though the mechanical properties were found to be increased by the lead oxide filler, the alkali treatments of the luffa fiber improve the interfacial adhesion. The alkali NaOH reacts with the cellulosic OH group and decreases the water-absorbing behavior of the treated fiber and improves the interaction with the hydrophobic matrix. ● Remarkable changes in the mechanical and thermal properties were observed with lead oxide as a filler incorporated polymer composite system. A homogenous and fine dispersion of the nanofiller lead oxide filler was attained with the action of the mechanical stirring process. ● Morphological images show the presence of minimum fiber pull out and better fiber-matrix interface bonding for the luffa fiber reinforced with 1.25 wt% of nanofiller PbO polymer composites. ● It is inferred that the addition of the nanofiller PbO in the matrix reduces the moisture absorption behavior when compared to the luffa fiber reinforced composite materials without the addition of the nanofiller PbO. ● Further, studies are required for replacing synthetic fibers with natural fibers in composites for industrial products, mainly related to the bonding of the reinforcement with the matrix."

Filler material PbO of 20 nm was added in different weight proportions along with luffa fiber to the matrix and the compression molding technique was used for the fabrication of the composite laminates. Tensile, flexural, and impact properties were studied on the prepared samples. The influence of lead oxide on glass transient temperature (Tg) and the curing of epoxy were also studied using the Differential scanning calorimeter. The optimum mechanical and thermal properties were observed on the addition of 1.25 wt. % of nanofiller. The morphological images show various defects like interfacial behavior, fiber pulls outs, voids, and internal cracks, and these were examined using a scanning electron microscope. Hence the present investigation showed that the addition of nanofiller could enhance the mechanical strength of the natural fiber composite. Further, it enhanced the moisture resistance and thus could find potential structural and packaging applications.",
