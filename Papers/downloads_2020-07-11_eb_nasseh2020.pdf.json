The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by degradation of tetracycline in aqueous suspension under visible light irradiation. The results showed that the complete degradation of tetracycline was attained under specific conditions of pH 9, photocatalyst loading of 0.02 g/L, contact time of 200min and initial tetracycline concentration of 15 mg/L. Under these conditions, the reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) were 87.94% and 61.76%, respectively. The reusability test showed that the photocatalyst had negligible efficiency lost (4.04%) after four cycles of tetracycline degradation. Finally, the mechanism of degradation was investigated and reaction products were detected by GC/MS.

      "text" : "In today's modern life, medicines such as antibiotics are widely used for the treatment of human and animal diseases. The presence of antibiotics as an emerging pollutant is one of the environmental growing concerns. In the recent decade, scientists have become interested in studying the fate of these medicines that are entering the environment and are refractory to conventional treatments in addition to their effects on organisms and the environment [1–3].\nTetracycline (TC) is one of the useful antibiotics being effective on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and somehow the mycoplasma and some of the fungi [4]. About 60 to 90% of the TC consumed\nsbmu.ac.ir (A. Asadi).\nby humans and animals is discharged to the environment through unmetabolized compounds, which are in turn released via urine and feces finding their ways into water and wastewater streams, and finally it causes environmental pollution. In addition, this antibiotic enters the environment through the wastewater produced by pharmaceutical industries [5,6]. Antibiotics will not be removed through conventional wastewater treatment processes due to their resistance against the biological treatment; therefore, they will find their ways into water and soil. Recently, many studies have confirmed the presence of antibiotics in surface waters and groundwater with concentrations of about 1–100 μg/L [7]. The presence of antibiotics, including TC, in aqueous solutions results in the resistibility of pathogens and pestiferous agents to such antibiotics, rendering them ineffective against reinforced pathogens. In addition, tetracycline has destructive effects on microbial breathing, nitrification process, and the reduction of triatomic iron\n(ferric ions) in the soil. Therefore, TC should be removed by effective methods before discharging of treated wastewater to the environment [8–12]. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been proven to be effective in removing such kind of organic compounds [13]. AOPs will result in the degradation of such organic materials which are resistant to the conventional biological decomposition [14–18]. Photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds is one of the AOPs processes that has been widely used for the removal of refractory organic compounds from aqueous solutions. In photocatalysis, a semiconductor material (such as ZnO, CuS, and TiO2 nano-particles) is used as the photocatalyst and a light source (UV, visible or sunlight) is used to produce the hydroxyl radical to decompose the organic matter [19–21]. The basis for the photocatalyst process is that by the collision of light photons to the surface of the catalyst, the electrons in the valance bandwill be stimulated and transferred to the conduction band. As a result, holes capable of adsorbing water molecules or hydroxyl ions and producing the hydroxyl radical will be formed in the valence band (VB). In addition, the excited electrons will react with oxygen and produce superoxide radical anions [9,14,20,22].\nZinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles are among semiconductor materials with band gap energy of about 3.2 eV similar to TiO2. In addition to properties such as chemical stability, non-toxicity, reusability, and low production costs, zinc oxide nanoparticles have higher light photons absorption compared to TiO2, which leads to higher photoactivity. It has also been demonstrated in other studies that ZnO nanoparticles have high photocatalytic activity at room temperature [20,23,24]. However, if the photocatalyst (ZnO nanoparticles) is used in the form of powder, the separation and reuse of these nanoparticles is disadvantageous and only possible by centrifuging or filtration. In addition, the separation of zinc oxide nanoparticles might not be fully fulfilled, which in turn results in secondary pollution. In order to overcome this problem, zinc oxide particles can be coated on the surface of magnetic nanoparticles so that the nanoparticles could be easily separated from the solution by applying an external magnetic field [23,25,26]. FeNi3 is among magnetic particles that are widely used for this purpose due to its high magnetic saturation, high permeability, high temperature resistibility, and low energy loss. Various catalysts have been magnetized using FeNi3 [25,26]; however, although these nanomaterials (FeNi3) have the capability to oxidize, they get decomposed under light radiation (i.e. ultraviolet and visible light). This core destruction leads to decrease in the photo-catalytic activity of the catalyst's semiconductor layer. Therefore, creating a layer of amaterial like silica between the catalyst and the core layer is necessary. The silica coating prevents the destruction of iron oxide; and it can provide the conditions for modification on the surface of the nano-core by creating Si-OH groups [25,26].\nBased on this information, in the present study, FeNi3 magnetic nano-core was synthesized first; then a layer of silica oxide was coated on the core surface to prevent its destruction and to avoid dissolution of this core in the photo-catalytic process. Afterward, zinc oxide was coated on the silica coating surface as the semiconductor for photocatalytic process [25,26]. Researchers like Jia et al. (2018) [27], Raagulan et al. (2019) [28] and Feng Guo et al. (2017) [29] utilized composites coated with zinc oxide for the degradation of organic pollutants. Therefore, in this study, a novel visible-light driven FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO nanocomposite was synthesized for the first time and investigated as a heterogeneous photo-catalyst for the degradation of TC in aqueous solutions."

However, according to this analysis, it is revealed that the presence of other materials in the FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO magnetic composite resulted in the band gap reduction of the zinc oxide. As a result, as shown in Fig. 6, the intended catalyst had a high and very good absorption in the 400–700 nm visible light region, showing that the synthesized composite is suitable for photo-catalytic processes in the visible light and/or sunlight range. Fig. 2 (insect) presents the band gap energy of synthesized FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO magnetic nano-composite having been found to be 2.2 eV, much reduced comparing to the band gap of pure ZnO nanoparticles, which is approximately 3.2 eV.

      "heading" : "3.2.1. The effect of pH",
      "text" : "Many researches in this area have investigated the effect of pH on antibiotics degradation, because the pH has a great effect on the adsorption capacity, electric charge distribution on the photo-catalyst surface,\nthe pollutant decomposition rate, and the oxidation potential of the valence band in the AOPS [43]. Also, these studies have concluded that the process efficiency increases as the pH increases in the photo-catalytic removal of TC using various nano-composites. The results of investigating the pH effect in this study also confirmed this; and in pH 9 and pH 3, themaximum (100%) andminimum (68.39%) TC removal percentwere obtained, respectively. According to Fig. 6a, the maximum TC degradation was occurred in alkaline solutions.\nTC is an amphoteric molecule and has three functional groups of tricarbonyl methane group, phenolic diketone group, and dimethylamino group. These functional groups in various pH environments and in aqueous solutions have different acidic constants (pKa) in that they exist in the acidic pH lower than 4 in the protonated form; in the acidic solution to the neutral solution (4 b pH b 7.5), they are in the neutral form; and in the neutral to alkaline range (7.5 b pH b 10), they exist in the anionic form. Based on this the variation in degradation rate and process, the efficiency of tetracycline with pH is different due to the domination of one or some types of TC. Therefore, in the photo-catalytic process, when tricarbonyl methane is present in the environment, the degradation of TC will happen in its minimumpercent. On the other hand,when the dimethylamino is dominant, the removal rate in this process would be increased in a way that the TC electron density would be higher in the alkaline environments compared to this type of antibiotics in acidic environments, and the attack of radical types will increase.\nVarious researches have shown that the photo-catalytic degradation of TC pollutant in the neutral pH, and especially in alkaline pH, has the maximum oxidation capacity. The results of the present research are consistent with the other studies because TC degradation, after 200 min in pH = 3, was about 68.39%, and it reached 89.36 and 100% by increasing pH values to 7 and 9, respectively. The results are in\nagreement to the ones reported by Safari et al. (2015) [9], Nasseh et al. (2018) [26], Yan Ma et al. (2012) [44], and Tang et al. (2015) [45].\nIn addition, the isoelectric point determination (pHzpc) is very important in studying the behavior of the synthesized nano-composite, because in the pH b pHpzc, the electric charge on the magnetic nanocatalyst is positive; and with the increase of pH (pH N pHpzc), its surface gets negative charge. In Fig. 6b, the isoelectric point (pHZPC) of the studied magnetic nano-composite was obtained to be about 6.94. As mentioned at the beginning of the discussion on pH as well as in many other studies, the TC molecule in the acidic pH mostly has a positive charge. According to these results, it was specified that in acidic pH, the surface of the studied magnetic nano-composite was positive; therefore, the adsorption of the pollutant on the surface of the FeNi3/ SiO2/ZnO magnetic nano-composite decreased due to the repulsive forces created between TC+ ions and the catalyst in the acidic pH. Also, due to the presence of a positive charge resulting from amine group in the dimethylamino of the TCmolecule and the negative charge of the catalyst surface in the alkaline pH, the pollutant was adsorbed to the catalyst surface, which resulted in the increase of the intended photo-catalytic degradation.\nMoreover, in the acidic pHs, the synthesized nano-composite tended to agglomerate; and as a result, the degradation percentage decreased. Also, the adsorption of the photons with energies higher than the band gap resulted in the transfer of an electron from the valence band to the conduction band through the simultaneous formation of holes in the valence band. These holes have a very strong oxidation potential and generate hydroxyl radicals from the water molecules and hydroxide ions adsorbed on the surface of the semiconductor. Therefore, OH radicals (that are the result of hydroxide (OH−) ions reaction with positive holes) are themost important factor for oxidation in neutral and alkaline pH, while the most important types of oxidation in acidic pH are only positive holes.\n3.2.2 The effect of magnetic nano-composite dosage. The dosage of the synthesized magnetic nano-composite also has an importance role in the photocatalytic processes [26]. The effect of FeNi3/ SiO2/ZnO nano-composite dosage was studied as a variable (0.005–0.1 g/L) under xenon light for the degradation of TC. For this reason, the tests were performed using a TC solution with the concentration of 20 mg/L and pH 9. Contrary to the first impression, the obtained results in Fig. 7 showed that the TC degradation removal efficiency at first increased with the increase of catalyst dosage and then decreased in such a way that in the dosages of 0.005, 0.02, and 0.1 g/L, the degradation in 200 min was 90.89%, 100%, and 61.3%, respectively. The reason for the increase of degradation efficiency with the increase of catalyst dosage from 0.005 to 0.02 g/L was that the number of active adsorption sites increases in parallel with increase in the dosage, in turn increasing the possibility of contact between the catalyst and the\npollutant. On the other hand, the increase of catalyst dosage results in the increase of absorbed photons and TC adsorbed molecules. The reason for the decrease of pollutant removal efficiency with the increase of the catalyst dosage from0.02 to 0.1 g/L could be explained by increase in the turbidity of the solution by the catalyst preventing light penetration. Also, the agglomeration and/or sedimentation of nanoparticles results in the decrease of accessible active sites for photon absorption in the surface of the catalyst.\nOn the other hand, as can be seen in Fig. 7, the degradation rate happened with high speed in the initial phase, in such a way that within 90 min, the degradation percent strongly increased; and after that, the TC degradation rate did not have a remarkable increase in this photocatalytic process. Therefore, the optimum nano-composite dosage and reaction time for the FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO/xenon process were 0.005 g/L and 90 min, respectively. It is possible that in real wastewaters, due to the presence of various anions like bromine, phosphate, chlorine, sulfate, etc., the decrease of light penetration happens and as a result the degradation rate decreases. Also, in the research conducted by Eslami et al. (2016) [46], where they studied photocatalytic degradation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory of naproxen and ibuprofen using the N, S co-doped TiO2 in the presence of visible light, it was specified that the degradation rate of these medicines increased as the dosage of nano-composite increased from 0.5 to 2.0 g/L, but the increase of the dosage to higher than 2.0 g/L of nano-composite reduced the degradation efficiency."

As can be seen, the intended TC degradation percentage drastically decreased as the concentration increased. The TC degradation rate for 10 mg/L TC during 200 min using FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO/xenon was about 100%; while for TC concentration of 30 mg/L, it was reduced to about 71.67% during same reaction time. TC degradation in lower initial concentrations under identical conditions increased, which was due to the higher availability of free radicals. In contrast, in higher concentrations, the emitted light was absorbed by the TC molecules and prevented the light to reach the catalyst particles` surface; as a result, all parts of the catalysts were not affected by the sunlight, leading to a significant decrease in TC degradation in parallel with increase in the amount of the pollutant. Another justification in this context could be related to increases in the pollutant adsorption rate on the catalyst; so that as the TC concentration increased, its adsorption rate on the FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO\nnano-composite surface increased as well. Therefore, the efficiency of the catalyst against the light emitted to it decreased. It is worth noting that the emission of the visible lights did not have any remarkable efficiency in TC degradation (b14% after 200 min). The results are in agreementwith the findings reported by Safari et al. [9] and Nasseh et al. [26] about TC degradation."

Following the previous studies performed in this context, a pseudo-first-order kinetic model was used for describing the degradation rate by photo-catalytic oxidation processes for organic pollutants [2,9,14,26]. For this reason, the test was performed under the optimal conditions (nano-composite dosage of 0.02 g/L, pH 9 and reaction time of 90 min) in various TC concentrations of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30mg/L. The results of the kinetic study have been presented in Table 1 and Fig. 2S. The results indicated that the reaction rate constant (kobs) had a significant reduction in the degradation performance as the TC concentration increased. The degradation kinetics of TC in all evaluated concentrations followed pseudo-first-order kinetic model with coefficient of determination (R2) close to unity. In higher TC concentrations, due to the increase in the concentration of by-products, the active hydroxyl radicals in the reaction got restricted; as a result, the decomposition rate constant decreased. The results presented in Table 1 implied that with the increase in TC concentration, the reaction rate constant drastically decreased from 0.025 to 0.0092 l/min by increasing TC concentration from 10 to 30 mg/L."

The results presented in Fig. 9, revealed that the FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO catalyst used in the present study had the capability of acceptable recovery and reusability, since after four cycles, its performance for TC degradation did not have any significant reduction (4.4%). The reason for this reduction could be the mass loss of the nanoparticle during every cycle. Therefore, the FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO nano-composite can be a proper catalyst for TC degradation under xenon light irradiation in practical point of view, as its application is very affordable in terms of utilization costs in the light of its high reusability and proper stability."

The removal of COD and TOC under optimal conditions and identification of possible intermediate compounds\nIt could be observed that the TC degradation using FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO/ Xenon under optimal conditions (i.e. TC concentration of 2 mg/L, catalyst dosage of 0.02 g/L, pH 9, and room temperature) was about 100%. However, the TOC and COD removal efficiencies of TC under the optimal conditions were 61.76% and 87.94%, respectively (see Fig. 10). This could be explained by the formation of intermediate organic byproducts. In other words, it could be said that some of the antibiotics were not completelymineralized and produced by-products whichwas\nindicated by TOC and COD. To identify the possible intermediate byproducts, the samples after the photocatalytic process were analyzed by GC/MS. The major degradation byproducts of TC were phthalic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (C16H22O4), 4,8,12-tetradecatrienal,5,9,13trimethyl (C17H28O), heptane,2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-methylene (C12H24), 3,8-dimethyldecane (C12H26), and decane,4-ethyl (C12H26), as shown on MS spectrum in Fig. 3S."

      "text" : "In the present research, we studied the TC photo-catalytic degradation in the same situation (pH 9, catalyst dose of 0.02 g/L, initial concentration of 20 mg/L) to compare the effect of FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO and ZnO nanoparticles on the TC degradation. The results showed that the FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO nano-composite had a higher efficiency than the ZnO nanoparticles in the removal of TC and COD after 200 min reaction time (see Fig. 4S). The degradation percentage of TC was 100 and 76.37% for FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO and ZnO nanoparticles, respectively. Also, in this condition, the removal percentage of COD was 87.94 and 56.92% for FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO and ZnOnanoparticles, respectively. The reason for the difference of FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO nano-composite performance with ZnO nanoparticles may be related to the reduction of ZnO band gap in the nano-composite (FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO band gap = 2.2 eV, ZnO band gap = 3.2 eV); therefore, the FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO nano-composite led to an enhanced photocatalytic process absorbing more photons. On the other hand, in this research, Table 2 was prepared in order to compare the efficiency of FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO synthesized nano-composite with other nanoparticles in terms of the degradation of TC antibiotic. Table 2 shows the optimal conditions for various nanoparticles in the\ndegradation of TC antibiotic. By comparing the optimal conditions, it can be concluded that the synthesized nano-composites show better photocatalytic activity than other composites such as FeNi3/SiO2/TiO2, FeNi3/SiO2/CuS and Calcite/titania nano-composites."

      "text" : "A novel FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO magnetic nano-composite was synthesized and evaluated for TC degradation in an artificial wastewater under the sunlight irradiation. The effects of different variables such as pH, nanocomposite dosage, and TC initial concentration were also investigated. DRS graph showed that these nanoparticles' light absorption was shifted toward visible light range. The VSM pattern indicated that FeNi3@SiO2@ZnOwere paramagnetic particles that could be easily separated by an external magnetic field. The EDX analysis confirmed the formation of FeNi3@SiO2@ZnO nanoparticles and demonstrated that Zn and O elements had the highest ratio in the structure of the catalyst. The results of photo-catalyst activity showed that the intended novel nano-composite had a proper performance in TC degradation and followed pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The results showed that under the optimal conditions of pH = 9, nano-catalyst dosage equal to 0.02 g/L, time = 200 min, and TC concentration of 15 mg/L, the photo-catalytic degradation of TCwas complete. The results of reusability test for FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO nano-composite indicated that its efficiency did not have a significant decrease and it could be used for TC degradation for several times. Therefore, due to the high performance of this novel FeNi3/SiO2/ZnO magnetic nano-composite for TC photo-catalytic degradation as well as its relatively simple synthesis path and easy separationwith theN42magnet, this can be used as a proper catalyst for the degradation of resistant organic pollutants such as TC.\nAuthor declaration\nWewish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associatedwith this publication and the source of funding for thework described in this publication is acknowledged.\nContribution statements\nNegin Nasseh, Ayat Hossein Panahi andMarzie Esmati carried out the experiment and verified the analytical methods.
