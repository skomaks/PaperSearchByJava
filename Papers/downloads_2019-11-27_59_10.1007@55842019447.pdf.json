      "text" : "Titanium implants are considered the gold standard of treatment for dental and orthopedic applications. Biocompatibility, low elasticity, and corrosion resistance are some of the key properties of these metallic implants. Nonetheless, a long-term clinical failure of implants may occur due to inadequate osseointegration. Poor osseointegration induces mobility, inflammation, increased bone resorption, and osteolysis; hence, it may result in painful revision surgeries. Topographical modifications, improvement in hydrophilicity, and the development of controlled-release drug-loading systems have shown to improve cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Surface modifications, along with drug coating, undoubtedly demonstrate better osseointegration, especially in challenged degenerative conditions, such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and osteogenesis imperfecta. Anabolic bone-acting drugs, such as parathyroid hormone peptides, simvastatin, prostaglandin-EP4-receptor antagonist, vitamin D, strontium ranelate, and anti-catabolic boneacting drugs, such as calcitonin, bisphosphonates, and selective estrogen receptor modulators, expedite the process of\nosseointegration. In addition, various proteins, peptides, and growth factors may accessorize the idea of localized therapy. Loading these substances on modified titanium surfaces is achieved commonly by mechanisms such as direct coating, adsorption, and incorporating in biodegradable polymers. The primary approach toward the optimum drug loading is a critical trade-off between factors preventing release of a drug immediately and those allowing slow and sustained release. Recent advances broaden the understanding of the efficacy of adsorption, hydrogel coating, and electrospinning layer-by-layer coating facilitated by differential charge on metallic surface. This review discusses the existing approaches and challenges for the development of stable and sustained drug delivery systems on titanium implants, which would promote faster and superior osseointegration.\nKeywords Biocompatibility · Biodegradable polymers · Drug coating · Drug delivery · Metallic surface · Osseointegration · Targeted drugs · Titanium implants"

      "text" : "Implantology, as a specialized branch of orthopedics and dentistry, has been recognized by clinician and researchers globally for quite some time. A. Barik and N. Chakravorty (*) School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, India e-mail: nishant@smst.iitkgp.ac.in\nWith the discovery of the phenomenon of “osseointegration” in the 1950–1960s, titanium became the material of choice for most clinicians in the field of dental and orthopedic implants (Brånemark et al. 2001). While implant surgeries often result in positive outcomes, premature failure is noted in about 10% of the cases (Kurtz et al. 2005). Such rare undesirable consequences arise from complications which eventually fail to provide enough mechanical support to diseased skeletal structures. Some of the primary reasons that require attention include insufficient tissue-metal integration, bacterial invasion, and foreign body reaction. In fact, these issues may become critical even after many years after successful osseointegration. Colonization of bacteria borne by saliva on the exposed surfaces of implants is the harbinger of distress and results in periimplantitis, i.e., a progressive loss of surrounding bone (Mombelli et al. 1987; Rams et al. 1984). Inadequate bone and soft tissue quality at the site of insertion also attributes to implant failure (Javed et al. 2013). Therefore, osseointegration still remains an important challenge in implantology research.\nResearchers and clinicians have always been of the opinion that supplemental treatment with drugs may help in improving the bone binding ability of implants. Although systemic administration of drugs along with implant placement is a conventional approach, side effects, such as systemic toxicity, short-term benefits, and patient inconvenience, limit their use. In contrast to these, localized therapy is generally devoid of these limitations (Anselmo and Mitragotri 2014; Park et al. 2014). Lately, focus has been placed on bone-specific delivery of active pharmaceutical and biological agents. Antibiotic-loaded polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement was first reported in the 1970s as an adjunct therapy for bone implants to reduce implantassociated infection (Bistolfi et al. 2011; Masri et al. 1998; Chapman and Hadley 1976; Holm and Vejlsgaard 1976; Marks et al. 1976; Buchholz and Engelbrecht 1970). A global commercialization of such products has eventually happened. However, these products received several criticisms, such as nonbiodegradability of the\ncement material used, erratic drug release due to permanent binding of most of the drug within the cement, possible drug degradation during the in situ exothermic process of self-curing, and others (Tobin 2017). Other FDA-approved biodegradable polymers were tried to incorporate drug molecules, which may be exemplified by poly lactic acid (PLA) or poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA). However, high temperature reactions that occur during the chemical bonding phase of most materials have discouraged their further use. Lessons learned from the past have guided us toward the use of modern implants coated with drug molecules using novel processes that avoid the aforementioned concerns. Simple, low temperature, reproducible processes, which can be optimized to guide extended release patterns of drugs, have become the present day methods of choice. Other ideal characteristics of such devices include the absence or minimal systemic toxicity by targeting at the organ, tissue, or cellular level, which allows the use of a lower drug dose. Additional care needs to be taken during the fabrication process, to retain the original mechanical properties of an implant.\nStandardization of therapeutic delivery of drugs is a challenging process for multiple reasons. Desirable drug release needs optimization of several factors, such as delivery vehicle, type of drug carrier, thickness, composition, focal tissue microenvironment, and physicochemical parameters of a drug. Moreover, standardization is dependent on the clinical requirements which, in turn, depend on the severity of a disease. A number of approaches toward a biological coating on titanium implants are reported and discussed in this review. The discussion highlights the current trending technology in coated orthopedic and dental devices, which is considered to mitigate the lack of localized bonding of implants to bone. To this end, collating a comprehensive list of features inclusive of minimum toxicity, enhanced device performance, or tunable release kinetics is a quite challenging task. New methods such as tethering of antimicrobial peptide molecules, incorporation of bone-specific growth factors and proteins, or bio-mimicking next-generation coatings are still gaining importance as\nevidenced from several in vitro and in vivo studies. Nonetheless, supporting clinical evaluation studies that would provide a better understanding and validation of these approaches are yet to come."

      "heading" : "2 Osseointegration of Titanium",
      "text" : "Alloy Implants\nTitanium and its alloys are recognized as highly promising materials for dental and orthopedic applications. Commercially, pure titanium is generally used for dental implants due to limited mechanical properties whereas alloys are suitable for prolonged high load bearing applications such as hip joint replacements, bone screws, or plates (Shah et al. 2016). The implants need to be fused completely with the surrounding tissues and provide the platform for cellular adhesion, proliferation, and maturation. Osseointegration is considered to be established, provided that the peri-implant bone is capable to resist surrounding shear forces and to maintain the maximum gap of 50 μm between implant and tissue to prevent forming fibrous capsule (Bloebaum et al. 1994). Bone formation around machined implants occurs through new bone deposition on existing bone tissue (distance osteogenesis) and direct osteoblastic activity on microroughened implants via contact osteogenesis (Yamaki et al. 2012; Amor et al. 2011; Davies 2003). Overall, this process usually starts by bone apposition in trabecular bone and then toward formation of compact bone, which can be histologically observed within 1 week of insertion, and the growth continues lifelong thereafter (Slaets et al. 2007). Osseointegration predominantly depends on numerous biological, physical, chemical, thermal, and other factors. Mechanical properties of titanium suggest that high dielectric constant of titanium oxide layer (naturally produced/deposited) assists in bonding tissue with metal surface.\nDespite the success of titanium as a bone implant, several clinical trials have reported failures upon long-term evaluations, and lack of osseointegration seems the culprit in most cases (Santos et al. 2002; Esposito et al. 1999). Over the years, several modifications have been attempted to improve bone-binding ability of implant surfaces. Topographical modifications by physical or chemical surface treatment to induce porosity or addition of a biocompatible coating are useful as shown in in vitro and in vivo experiments (Salou et al. 2015; Donos et al. 2011; Bjursten et al. 2010; Li et al. 2004; Klokkevold et al. 1997) Such modified surfaces assist the bone cells to grow on the surface and down through the interconnected pores, tubes, and channels (Mandracci et al. 2016). The patterns induce roughness to increase the surface area of the modified implants compared to the smooth polished ones (Le Guehennec et al. 2007). Present-day concepts concerning implant instability emphasize that topographies in the micro-to-nano ranges improve implant fixation (Ferraris et al. 2015; Davies et al. 2013). Imparting surface roughness, especially in a range of 1–10 μm, shows positive effects in terms of biomolecular interaction between bone and implant (Damiati et al. 2018; Liang et al. 2017; Gittens et al. 2014). Other studies have reported different ranges of pores to be conducive to cellular anchorage, estrogenic differentiation, and bone ingrowth along with vascular system development, including some studies where pore diameters up to about few hundred microns seems favorable (Vasconcellos et al. 2008; Otsuki et al. 2006). Nano-scale (defined as less than 100 nm) modifications of titanium implants are recently gaining interest owing to their ability to not only change physical but also the chemical interaction patterns capable to produce effects on the interface biology. Nano-roughening, reportedly, increases the contact area of titanium with human bone “grains”, which are usually 20–80 nm long and 2–3 nm in diameter for osteoid minerals (Staruch et al. 2016). This is believed to increase cell adhesion energy and thereby leads to better protein adsorption, cellular proliferation, and differentiation (Xie et al. 2017). Some studies have failed to differentiate the osteogenic activity between micro- and nano-scale modifications, except the tendency for upregulation of genes on nano-structured surfaces (Barik et al. 2017). The primary objective of the\nsurface treatment is to reduce the micromovement of implants during the post-implantation period, so that stability is achieved at the earliest. Thereafter, full osseointegration may only be assured."

      "heading" : "3 Use of Drugs: Chemical Ways for Improvement",
      "text" : "Combinatorial therapy is always considered to be a better choice of treatment, especially in clinical situations prone to develop complications, or where there is a need for prophylactic action to prevent failure of therapy. Biofilm formation and lack of osseointegration are the two main factors impeding the long-term success of titanium implants. Use of antibiotics to prevent biofilm formation and several anti-resorptive and anabolic agents to ensure implant-bone binding are undoubtedly the mainstream treatment modalities being considered since years.\nChoice of antibiotics to combat the risk of susceptible infections primarily depends on the type of infective organism. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli have been identified as the most common organisms involved in implant-associated infections and osteomyelitis (Ribeiro et al. 2012). A broad range of antibiotics have been tested in vitro and in vivo. These include cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolones, carbapenems, and glycopeptides (Romano et al. 2015). Considering the fact that systemic administration of antibiotics prior to surgery has been found to be ineffective in up to 4% of cases of total hip and knee arthroplasties (Stigter et al. 2004), a need for localized drug therapy has been emerging. This proposition has paved the way to develop drugincorporated implants. Surface tethering of implants to prevent bacterial adhesion and colonization has been widely investigated by either surface coating with antibiotics or by incorporating antimicrobial molecules through covalent attachments. Imparting bioactivity in this way disrupts the microbes on attachment to the surface, resulting in inhibition of biofilm formation (Ketonis et al. 2012). Slow and sustained\nelution of immobilized drug should be ensured to reach the effective concentration at a constant rate for a minimum of 4 weeks in addition to peak release for initial 4–7 days (Pan et al. 2018). Achieving the effective minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antibiotic at the site is equally important, aside from sustained release of a drug, since lower drug concentrations might induce microbial resistance and higher ones might produce toxic reactions.\nBone growth around the grafted implants is a continuous cyclic process balanced by homeostatic activity between osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Osteoclast-mediated bone resorption needs to be balanced at one end of this feedback loop. Bisphosphonates (alendronate, zoledronate, or risedronate) are the commonest agents belonging to anti-resorptive drugs used to mediate increased osteoblastic activity. The presence of carbon as a bridge between phosphate ions in the chemical structure helps the drug to bind the divalent cations, especially Ca2+ present in hydroxyapatite in the site for active bone remodeling (Qayoom et al. 2018). Several clinical, preclinical, and in vitro studies have evaluated the efficacy of estrogen, denosumab, and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) such as raloxifene, although mostly without using implants (Faverani et al. 2018; Steffi et al. 2017; Januario et al. 2001; T{raş et al. 2000). These molecules chemically mimic the biological activity of estrogen – a natural bone protector. They bind to the same ligand-binding domain present in estrogen receptors (ER), producing a conformational change with some minor differences. As a result, they promote further binding of other co-regulatory proteins that activate the transcriptional process acting on specific consensus ER response elements in the target gene promoter regions, the way estrogen naturally does (Migliaccio et al. 2007). This anti-resorptive therapy exerts the overall protective effect on the bone by reducing the activity, life span, and a number of osteoclasts, which stabilize trabecular microarchitecture, preserves bone mass, and bone mineral density, decreasing the risk of fractures.\nAnabolic drugs are another group of pharmacological agents that play a positive role in\nimproving bone mineral density, aiding both cortical and trabecular bone formation. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that they may increase overall bone strength by positively modulating bone remodeling (Brandi 2012). Teriparatide, parathyroid hormone, or anti-sclerostin antibodies are some examples of anabolic agents (Shibamoto et al. 2018; Suzuki et al. 2017, 2018; Lai et al. 2017; Virdi et al. 2015). Strontium ranelate is a compound that has garnered a lot of attention in treatment of osteoporosis, owing to its unique properties of possessing both anticatabolic and anabolic effects. The presence of both anti-resorptive and pro-bone forming abilities restores bone formation by balancing bone metabolism (Meunier et al. 2004). Furthermore, possession of similar mechanical and chemical properties akin to calcium allows easy incorporation of strontium into the mineral phase of bone, pointing to its effectiveness in treating osteoporosis (Kyllonen et al. 2015; Li et al. 2012a; Maïmoun et al. 2010). There is a multitude of pharmacological tools that appears effective in inducing bone formation and inhibiting bone resorption. Surprisingly, very few of those drugs have so far been tried for coating on implants. Bisphosphonates are one of the most common classes of drugs that have been investigated for this kind of localized release."

      "text" : "Immobilization technology on titanium implants is still in its stage of infancy. Despite the plurality of research in the area, experiments are still restricted to in vitro cell culture and there are few preclinical studies. Systemic administration, i.e., oral, subcutaneous, or intramuscular is approved as the most suitable mode of treatment. Localized drug administration is less promising due to variabilities in drug loading. Additionally, local pharmacokinetics in such type of drug delivery still needs to be defined. Quantitative determination of released drugs is complicated as in vivo adverse interactions, such as enzymatic degradation, colloidal aggregation, or unwanted\nligand binding with cell receptors, decrease the bioavailability of a drug at the peri-implant region (Pokrowiecki 2018). Sustained drug release at the site of action is much more advantageous in the long term, provided that the drug dosing could be suitably controlled. Overall, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of small molecules can be improved by controlling the rate of drug dissolution and diffusion through maintaining a steady rate of degradation of a carrier. Coating on metallic implants, like titanium, may be idealized by featuring a few characteristics (Zemtsova et al. 2018; Tobin 2017; Santos et al. 2014) which are represented in the following flowchart (Fig. 1).\n5 Types of Implant Coating: What We Know\nA number of biologically active materials can act as potential candidates for coating implant surfaces with growth factors and drugs. Various ways of coatings are inspired by inorganic (hydroxyapatite) and organic (extracellular matrix and proteins) components of the bone or by a combination of components, which truly resembles bone (de Jonge et al. 2008). Drug properties such as solubility, potency, and desired site of action and clearance rate each influences a suitable selection of a desired drug delivery mode (Damiati et al. 2018). Additionally, choice of the mode determines the drug loading capacity, duration of release, and the most appropriate route for administration. Features of a drug delivery mode, such as size, surface charge and hydrophobicity, shape, flexibility, and inclusion of targeting moieties, affect performance and its bio-distribution. The resultant drug release from any carrier is determined by a complex interaction between the drug properties, polymer characteristics, and in vivo conditions."

      "heading" : "5.1 Films",
      "text" : "Two-dimensional film formation on titanium implants by coating is the simplest strategy for localized drug delivery. Physical adsorption of a\ndrug-incorporated polymer solution on the surface by means of dipping, spray coating, or drop casting techniques are in common practice (Corobea et al. 2015; Cortizo et al. 2012). Despite simplicity, reproducibility among batches is a major concern with this method. Lack of uniformity of single coatings and inability to standardize the amount of a drug to be loaded into the thin film make the technique questionable for appropriate implementation. In addition, control of various parameters such as chemical composition, thickness, or architecture also needs to be taken care of (Boudou et al. 2010). Polyelectrolyte multilayer films (PEM), which is conformal electrostatically bonded thin film by alternate dip/spray coating of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, have been evaluated to get a reproducible uniform coating on titanium substrates. Loading of BMP-2, an osteo-conductive agent, on PEM appears quite uniform and also provides a uniform release rate in bioactivity assays as well as in vivo studies (Guillot et al. 2016). This selfassembly process starts with the dipping of an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte solution on a charged substrate to form a monolayer by absorption. The step is repeated with intermittent washing after each coating to remove weakly bound or unbound species. A variety of parameters may complicate the otherwise simple and straightforward process. The pH, concentration, ionic strength of the polyelectrolyte solution, and the time of deposition need to be highly optimized to standardize the morphology, thickness, and biological features of the film (Shi et al. 2017). Occasionally, an initiator is needed to impart a stable charge to the surface in an attempt to further improve the adhesion of a film. Poly-L-lysine is one such initiator compound in common practice (Shu et al. 2011). Another application of this layer-by-layer (LBL) technique has been reported by Qian et al. (2014), where the authors used an alternate coating with heparin and chitosan and\nthey loaded an anti-osteoporotic drug (HU-308) by simple adsorption on the film. Coated implants showed new bone formation and improved osseointegration at an early-to-middle stage of placement."

      "heading" : "5.2 Hydrogels",
      "text" : "Hydrogels are best defined as hydrophilic interpenetrating 3D networks of one, two, or more polymers formed by physical and chemical crosslinking of the participating molecules. Hydrogels inherently have high swelling properties when in contact with water or any other type of body fluid, while maintaining their 3D shape, mechanical, and elastic properties (Sosnik and Seremeta 2017). Porosity, an attractive feature for their widespread use in tissue engineering, can be tuned by the extent of crosslinking reaction and the interstitial spaces may be used to load therapeutic compounds. These interlinked pores help diffuse drug molecules within tissues or surrounding cells and help pass nutrients and factors through the gel to provide a platform for cellular growth (Concheiro and Alvarez-Lorenzo 2013; Anumolu et al. 2009). Synthetic polymers, such as polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyacrylic acid (PAA), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and natural ones, such as silk fibroin, dextran, alginate, chitosan, and gelatin, are commonly used to formulate hydrogels that provide a solubilizing environment to incorporate hydrophilic drugs (Wei et al. 2014). The amount of a drug released is very critical during the design of a hydrogel-based local drug delivery system. Antibiotic-laden hyaluronic acid-based hydrogels impair bone formation only up to certain concentration of a drug (Boot et al. 2017). A fast resorbable hydrogel composed of covalently linked hyaluronian and poly-D,L-lactide inhibits bacterial colonization by immediate release of antibiotics (Drago et al. 2014). Sustained long-term drug release is most desirable for regenerative purposes. Recently, a complex localized drug delivery approach was attempted by Li et al. (2017), where the drug-incorporating four-armed thiolated\nPEG-hydrogel was used to retard the initial burst release. Crosslinked starch was used to further reduce the possibility of fast swelling kinetics of hydrogel. Polydopamine-assisted surface modification enhances the adhesion stability of a hydrogel film. Several coating procedures and the release of drug molecules from films and hydrogels are presented in Fig. 2."

      "heading" : "5.3 Microparticles",
      "text" : "This submicron particulate drug delivery system offers a number of advantages including cellspecific drug delivery following endocytosis. Such systems are particularly useful to sustain a drug level at a localized region while minimizing systemic toxicity (Kohane 2007). Controlled release kinetics of drugs from microparticles depends on the rate of water penetration in the carrier and subsequent hydrolytic degradation of the polymer. A hollow structure of spheres allows the maximum entrapment of a drug amount to be loaded. Hydrophobic polymers, such as poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) or laboratorydesigned co-polymers having tunable hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties, e.g., thioethercontaining ω-hydroxy acid (TEHA), block copolymers with poly-caprolactone, or TEHA with poly ethylene glycol, are usually the ones selected for the formation of microparticles loaded with hydrophobic drugs (Nerantzaki et al. 2018). Immobilization or attachment of microparticles on the titanium implants may require physical or chemical treatment. For instance, Dawes et al. (2010) have thermally immobilized dexamethasone-loaded microspheres on electrolytically oxidized titanium surfaces. A similar method has been employed to render the metal hydrophilic, with subsequent loading of microspheres performed by polyethyleneimine treatment (Son et al. 2013). Vacuum drying and attachment at room temperature are some of the other methods that have been attempted for bonding of microspheres to metal surface (Xiao et al. 2014). One of the challenges with such delivery systems is to retard the fast release of hydrophilic drugs due to its high\naqueous solubility. Chitosan and sodium alginate are some of the hydrophilic polymers which have been tried to develop the drug-loaded microspheres, and these agents may be entrapped into the porous titanium surface as reported by Wang et al. (2015)."

      "heading" : "5.4 Nanoparticles",
      "text" : "Nanoparticles (typically ranged 1–100 nm) are considered as ideal vehicles for drug delivery that allow fast accumulation of drugs in the targeted regions. Nanoparticles as drug delivery systems are usually more advantageous than microparticles due to a greater proportion of drug entrapment and the ability to cross most of the biological barriers (Kohane 2007). Considering a high surface-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles, such systems may occasionally exhibit a greater toxicity, owing to the high encapsulation and release of a drug at the site. The nano-scale of particles also is capable of triggering immunological responses when they come in contact with host cells, and hence limits the increase in their use for drug delivery (Moreno-Vega et al. 2012). Despite the limitation, nanoparticle coating on implants imparts osteo-conductivity due to a high surface area, aside from the other advantages as outlined above. Chitosan nanoparticles for delivery of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and ciprofloxacin have been studied successfully by coating on titanium implants, using spray coating and drop casting in two different studies (Poth et al. 2015; De Giglio et al. 2012). In the former study, a degree of acetylation of chitosan was tailored for fast biodegradation by lysozyme, which expectedly helped in a dosedependent ectopic bone growth in vivo. In the later study, ionic gelation principle was used to form β-cyclodextrin-based inclusion complexes between ciprofloxacin molecules itself and between chitosan and ciprofloxacin molecule while preparing nanoparticles, with the intention to obtain maximum release within first 5 days\npost-implantation. In both cases, nanoparticles were confirmed to be biocompatible, highly encapsulated, and had a narrow size distribution. Nanoparticle-based prolonged release has been found feasible in some studies. A combination of other surface modifications prior to nanoparticle loading, such as electrophoretic deposition of ciprofloxacin-loaded hydroxyapatite nanoparticles on acid-etched titanium, is another successful strategy for prolonged release as described by Geuli et al. (2017). Ibuprofenloaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles and chitosan were electrolytically co-deposited to form another novel drug release system which, after changing the pH, eventually formed interpenetrating chitosan hydrogel network containing nanoparticles (Zhao et al. 2014). This system shows zero-order drug release strongly influenced by pH and both electrical stimuli. The coating of microparticles/ nanoparticles on titanium surfaces has been briefly presented in Fig. 3."

      "heading" : "5.5 Electrospun Nanofibers",
      "text" : "Nanofibers are characterized by non-woven highly porous structure with high permeability, stability, surface area, and ease of functionalization. These fibers are produced by electrospinning technique. This simple setup operates with a high voltage power supply that allows the spinneret to spin polymer solutions and allow formation of fibers that can be collected on a grounded metal collector at ambient conditions (Al-Enizi et al. 2018). Extracellular matrix of most of the human organs and tissues, for instance, bone and skin which need prostheses for regeneration, consists of organized hierarchical fibrous interwoven structures. Coating of such prostheses with fiber mats resembling the natural microporous structure enables the support of cellular anchorage within the pores and provides a sufficient area for cell growth (Kenry and Lim 2017; Khadka and Haynie 2012). Such fibrous coatings have been shown to inhibit implant failure by modifying the mismatched interface between hard metal and soft tissue (Al-Enizi et al. 2018). Production of the electrospun nanofibers is generally performed using polymers or materials, such as PLGA, which have similar biocompatibility features to those used for the other delivery systems as discussed above (Ashbaugh et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2014; Li et al. 2012b). Drug-loaded nanofibers can be produced either by blending the drug with polymer prior to electrospinning or by adsorption and immobilization of factors on the fibers afterward. Notably, incorporation of hydrophilic drugs in hydrophobic polymers during blending is not possible due to solubility issues. To overcome this problem and to attain sustained release, investigators have successfully tried co-axial electrospinning while entrapping the drug in a hydrophilic core surrounded by a hydrophobic sheath (Song et al. 2017). Simple hydrophilic polymer combinations, such as chitosan and polyethylene oxide, have also been used for loading of vancomycin. Another alternative is pretreatment of titanium implants with coating of chitosan and gelatin for better attachment of nanofibers (Sadri et al. 2017). A combination of surface treatment with polymer-assisted drug delivery has always shown better results when compared to either one. These two separate features synergistically help in osseointegration and anti-infective properties, depending on the drug to be delivered. In vivo results show better bone growth on titanium surfaces with microgrooves filled with drugloaded nanofibers (Khandaker et al. 2017). The process is limited by the concurrent effects of multiple variables acting together, such as the voltage applied, flow rate of solution, diameter of needle, distance between needle and the collector, or the polymer solution properties, such as viscosity, molecular weight, dielectric constant, and surface tension. Control of the porosity is a real research challenge since it depends on the diameter of the formed fibers, which, in turn, is depended on multiple factors as mentioned above. Other challenges include lack of infiltration of cells within smaller pores that may be formed due to the smaller diameter of fibers, leading to inapplicability of the coated device in\ntissue engineering (Dahlin et al. 2011). The formation of electrospun nanofibers and encapsulation of drugs is represented in Fig. 4."

      "heading" : "5.6 Titanium Nanotubes",
      "text" : "Physical adsorption of drugs on the TiO2 nanotube arrays to enable controlled release at a site of administration is considered an innovative smart technology and has been suggested for applications in dentistry and orthopedics. Excellent in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility and high surface area due to the presence of nano-porous organization provide a good template for drug loading, which is better than those with other strategies, and also support the spread of bone cells inside the nanotopographies. Low immunogenicity due to the complete absence of any foreign materials glorifies the great potential of nanotubes to be introduced into bone tissue engineering (Ainslie et al. 2009). Self-assembled porous nanostructures are produced upon the establishment of equilibrium between the reactions in the electrochemical anodization process. The oxide formation on the surface after dissolution of the metal occurs parallel with the formation of vertically aligned porous nanostructure on the oxide layer dissolution (Wang et al. 2016). A variety of parameters involved in the anodization, such as reaction temperature, anodization voltage, or reaction time, controls the features of nanotubes, such as the diameter, length, aspect ratio, and volume. These features are highly correlated with the drug release rate which mostly follows diffusion-limited processes, defined by Fick’s first law (Azhang et al. 2015). Hydrophilic drug loading in nanotubes usually follows a simple process of physical adsorption of the aqueous solution. For controlled diffusion of drugs, introduction of a biocompatible polymeric coating, such as PLGA or chitosan, over the nanotube arrays may be beneficial to tune and extend the burst and sustained release as necessary. The coating also favors the cellular attachment and proliferation (Wang et al. 2017; Gulati et al. 2012). Apart from topographical modification and biodegradable polymer\ncoatings, drug loading in, and release from, nanotubes can be controlled by introducing some other carriers, such as micelles or nanoparticles, especially to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs and to combine hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs (Aw et al. 2012). Drug delivery by titanium nanotubes is summarized in Fig. 5."

      "heading" : "6 Limitations in the Current Technology and Future Perspectives: Bridging the Gap",
      "text" : "While drug-releasing implants are currently well established and quite standardized for the intervention in cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, the development of bone-specific localized drug delivery has not been fully implemented into clinical practice. Therapeutic benefits need to be confirmed through a rigorous path of translational research, from in vitro to in vivo to clinical trials, to reduce the risk of clinical failure. Investigations in experimental animals do not guarantee success in human application (Anselmo and Mitragotri 2014). Apart from economic constraints and limitations in clinical feasibility, each of the approaches of drug coating on titanium implants provides some benefits, but also has inherent drawbacks. Keeping the upcoming technologies in mind, customized 3D printing of drug-loaded titanium implants might be a realistic solution in the near future. The advent of 3D printing technology in the area of customizable orthopedics is expected to rise. The 3D printouts, free from complex scaffolds and metal mono-blocks, are completely devoid of stiffness mismatch at bone-implant interface due to reprogramming of the stress shielding pattern by variation of the porosity. This interconnected porous network aids in rapid bone in-growth, if the shape and porosity can be controlled by rapid prototyping method, which makes it a suitable candidate for orthopedic applications (Lopez-Heredia et al. 2008). Elastic modulus also needs to be adjusted\naccording to that of the natural tissue (Heinl et al. 2008). The production of 3D printed porous scaffold incorporated with drugs has already been used for a case of surgery in tuberculous spinal infection where poly-D,L-lactase and nanohydroxyapatite were blended with anti-tubercular drugs (Dong et al. 2014). Spinal tuberculosisinduced bone defect has been successfully reconstructed by this scaffold, ensuring spinal stabilization.\nControlled drug release from titanium implant surfaces has been recently made possible by a selective laser melting process (Hassanin et al. 2018). It is hypothesized that the drug release kinetics through the drug-loaded internalized compartments and microchannels can be predicted and modified as desired. These topographies are optimized to achieve a minimum deviation in microchannel dimension and surface roughness at 1–2 μm, depending upon the laser power. Despite investigations pointing to better endurance of laser-deposited titanium implants, clinical application of such implants is still limited (Chan et al. 2013). If implemented, it holds\nan excellent opportunity for implant-mediated targeted drug delivery system.\nSmart biosensing technique can also be utilized to switch on and off the release of a drug on demand depending on the severity and stage of a defect as well as progression of improvement. Sirivisoot et al. (2011) have developed a smart anodized nano-tubular titanium implant where anti-inflammatory and antibiotic molecules are electro-deposited on poly-pyrrole, a polymer that can be electrochemically synthesized on conductive materials. These carbon nanotubes act as biosensing electrodes to detect the type of cellular attachment or tissue formation around the implant, based on differences in electrical conductivity between inflammatory cells, bone cells, and bacteria. Those authors have shown the feasibility of delivering a drug of choice, once a particular biological event is determined. Titanium implant-attached biochemical sensing to assess blood indices may also become a way of noninvasive disease monitoring (Li and Lu 2015), a technique that can be associated with the drug delivery platform."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "This review summarized different forms of titanium implants, based on drug delivery modes which have been successively developed and modified over recent years. The most challenging clinical situation arising post-implantation is a peri-implant infection and lack of osseointegration. Biologics and drug molecules have a pivotal role to ensure the stability and long-activity of implants, whether administered locally or systemically. The experimental phase of research into these aspects continues to deliver stable biologic coating on orthopedic implants, in which the type, carrier, method, thickness, stability, and in vivo degradation constitute some of the important concerns. The predicted mathematical relationship between mechanical degradation of coating and diffusion kinetics of drug molecules stored in the reservoir should be mimicked in vivo. An effective commercial technique should be designed to advance industrial production. Apart from these, all the stakeholders, especially surgeons, should be clearly aware of the proper indications for storage and use of titanium implants to avoid any misuse or unintended failure.\nConflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest in relation to this article.\nEthical Approval This review article does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors."

    "abstractText" : "Titanium implants are considered the gold standard of treatment for dental and orthopedic applications. Biocompatibility, low elasticity, and corrosion resistance are some of the key properties of these metallic implants. Nonetheless, a long-term clinical failure of implants may occur due to inadequate osseointegration. Poor osseointegration induces mobility, inflammation, increased bone resorption, and osteolysis; hence, it may result in painful revision surgeries. Topographical modifications, improvement in hydrophilicity, and the development of controlled-release drug-loading systems have shown to improve cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Surface modifications, along with drug coating, undoubtedly demonstrate better osseointegration, especially in challenged degenerative conditions, such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and osteogenesis imperfecta. Anabolic bone-acting drugs, such as parathyroid hormone peptides, simvastatin, prostaglandin-EP4-receptor antagonist, vitamin D, strontium ranelate, and anti-catabolic boneacting drugs, such as calcitonin, bisphosphonates, and selective estrogen receptor modulators, expedite the process of osseointegration. In addition, various proteins, peptides, and growth factors may accessorize the idea of localized therapy. Loading these substances on modified titanium surfaces is achieved commonly by mechanisms such as direct coating, adsorption, and incorporating in biodegradable polymers. The primary approach toward the optimum drug loading is a critical trade-off between factors preventing release of a drug immediately and those allowing slow and sustained release. Recent advances broaden the understanding of the efficacy of adsorption, hydrogel coating, and electrospinning layer-by-layer coating facilitated by differential charge on metallic surface. This review discusses the existing approaches and challenges for the development of stable and sustained drug delivery systems on titanium implants, which would promote faster and superior osseointegration.",
