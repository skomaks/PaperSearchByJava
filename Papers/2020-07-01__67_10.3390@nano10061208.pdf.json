      "text" : "Quantum Dots (QDot®s) are novel, semi-conductive nanomaterials used for many biological applications such as tumor targeting, cellular environment imaging, and cancer metastasis tracking [1–7]. Experimental usage of QDot®s has surpassed traditional dyes such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) due to their superior photostability, brightness, and small particle size [8–10]. Furthermore, the outer shell of QDot®s can be modified for its intended purpose; for example, this shell can be carboxylated to allow for coupling between QDot®s and amine groups of proteins or peptides [11,12]. These characteristics of QDot®s along with its capability to attach to proteins allow for real-time imaging, high resolution microscopy, and in vivo experimentation. Utilization of QDot®s provides the opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of proteins that may be implicated in diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis, and osteosarcoma. Further to this, proteins that are well-studied but lack research on their trafficking and uptake can be identified by using QDot®s, such as when these proteins are involved in aberrant signaling and disease progression. A specific example is bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), which is implicated in aberrant signaling during osteopenia and osteoporosis, however, the mechanism of this pathway is unknown [13–16]. By conjugating QDot®s to BMP-2, the altered signaling pathways can be determined. BMP-2 is a member of the largest subgroup of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily and has crucial roles in development, cardiogenesis, neurogenesis, adipogenesis,\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1208; doi:10.3390/nano10061208 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1208 2 of 13\nchondrogenesis, and osteogenesis [17–26]. Furthermore, BMP-2 is a critical factor that commits mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to differentiate into osteoblasts, which are responsible for forming new bone [12,18,27]. Due to its multifunctionality, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved usage of recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) during anterior lumbar interbody spinal fusion (ALIFs) surgeries in 2002 [28–33]. BMP-2 functions by activating downstream signaling pathways. First, BMP-2 is secreted and binds to bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMPRs), including BMPRIa, BMPRIb, and BMPRII, which are serine/threonine kinases [13,25,34–38]. Most commonly, BMP-2 will bind to BMPRIa and BMPRII complexes. These complexes can localize in clathrin coated pits (CCPs), caveolae, or lipid rafts [34,37,39–41]. Once the protein binds to BMPRII, casein kinase 2 (CK2) is released from BMPRIa, which exposes a glycine-serine (GS) rich homeobox domain. BMPRII phosphorylates this GS box, leading to activation of Smad (canonical) and non-Smad (non-canonical) signaling pathways [42–44]. BMPRs localized in caveolae will lead to activation of Smad signaling, while BMPRs localized in CCPs will activate non-Smad signaling [34,37,39,45]. In the Smad pathway, BMPRIa phosphorylates Smad 1, 5, and 8, which recruit Smad4. The complex then translocates to the nucleus to serve as a transcription factor for genes such as RUNX2, which is a master regulator of other genes such as Osterix [17,20,35]. In the non-Smad pathway, BMPRIa activates pathways such MAPK, ERK, and PI3K to regulate cell survivability and proliferation [15,46]. Despite the ability of BMP-2 to activate multiple pathways, the association of BMP-2 with BMPRIa and the shuttling or endocytosis of the complexes have not been fluorescently labeled. Previously, peptide-derived BMP-2 was conjugated to oxidized detonation nanodiamonds, however, its functionality or fluorescent activity remains unknown [47]. Additionally, BMP-2 was bound to a FITC fluorescent dye, however, the stability and functionality of this conjugation was not assessed as FITC bleaches rapidly [45]. To elucidate mechanisms of BMP-2 signaling, we use QDot®s. In our study, the QDot®s are carboxylated to attach to the lysine amino acids of BMP-2 using N,N’-Dicyclohexylcrbodiimide (DCC) as the coupling reagent. Vrathasha et al. 2018 demonstrated that the peptide CK2.3, which inhibits activity of casein kinase 2 (CK2), can be derivatized at the lysine residue to form an amide bond with the QDot®s [1]. Here, we demonstrate a functionally active and stable conjugation between BMP-2-QDot®s for at least 14 days. Additionally, the BMP-2-QDot®s conjugation colocalizes with BMPRs by 1 h, and the conjugation increases mineralization similar to unconjugated BMP-2. This is the first study in which the stability and functionality of a BMP-2 probe was assessed, and this advancement will allow us to elucidate more functions of BMP-2 during the progression of diseases."

      "heading" : "4. Discussion",
      "text" : "For the first time, we report the stability and functionality of a BMP-2 analog. BMP-2 was conjugated to QDot®s because QDot®s are photostable, excitable, and limit photobleaching [7,9]. These qualities of QDot®s are optimal to observe protein colocalization and movement [3,4,7,10,12]. Further to this, we report that QDot®s do not interfere with the biological activity of BMP-2, demonstrating the effectiveness of this probe. To ensure successful attachment of the BMP-2 amino groups to the QDot®s carboxyl groups, we used DCC, which is a well-established coupling reagent [54]. Followed by coupling, we utilized size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to separate the BMP-2-QDot®s conjugation from other solutes present in the solution. However, SEC limits the volume of the conjugation solution, providing us with only 100 µL. Due to this small volume, large-scale experimentation and multiple repetitions during the same trials were limited. Followed by SEC, we utilized UV/VIS and FTIR spectroscopy to verify BMP-2 was conjugated to QDot®s and determine its stability over time [55]. Our data demonstrate that the BMP-2 analog is the most stable to date, as the conjugation remains stable for at least 14 days (Figures 1–3). In addition, these findings suggest that it is possible that other BMPs, such as BMP-4 and BMP-6, can be conjugated to QDot®s and may be utilized in other research fields. After observing the successful conjugation of BMP-2-QDot®s and determining its stability, we conducted immunofluorescent labeling of C2C12 cells to study the colocalization of BMP-2-QDot®s with one of BMP-2’s receptors, BMPRIa. For the first time, our data demonstrate that the BMP-2 analog colocalizes with BMPRIa after one hour of stimulation. Furthermore, some of the BMP-2-QDot®s conjugates were internalized into the cell, similar to results published in previous studies [1]. However, shorter and longer stimulation times are needed to determine how quickly BMP-2-QDot®s colocalize with BMPRIa and when the complex is internalized into cells. Additionally, subsequent studies are needed to determine how long BMP-2-QDot®s remain in cells, if the complex with BMPRIa is shuttled back to the cell surface, or if the complex is degraded [56]. We observed the functional activity of the BMP-2-QDot®s by using the von Kossa assay. The von Kossa assay uses silver nitrate to bind to phosphate groups, which are produced after pyrophosphate is cleaved by alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a protein that is upregulated by BMP-2 [57,58]. Thus, with BMP-2 present, more ALP should be active, creating more phosphate groups that can be bound to by silver nitrate. With silver nitrate attached to the phosphate groups, the samples are then exposed to UV light, causing mineralization areas to appear as dark deposits. Our data show that the BMP-2-QDot®s produce similar mineralization deposits to BMP-2 only stimulation, suggesting that our BMP-2 analog is functional. Furthermore, both the BMP-2-QDot®s and BMP-2 had significantly higher normalized mineralization when compared to unstimulated cells, which were 4.10 and 4.70, respectively. In conclusion, our main goal was to develop a stable and active BMP-2 analog that could be visualized in a cellular context. Although most fluorophores rapidly degrade and are not photostable, QDot®s can be used because of its photostability and intense fluorescence [9,10]. QDot®s have also been used in previous studies to observe tumor progression and in vivo visualization [2,6]. A concern of using QDot®s is that its cadmium and selenide metal core may be toxic in a cellular environment, especially in long-term experimentation [11,59–61]. However, previous studies and the current study demonstrate that short-term usage of these QDot®s is non-toxic to cells [11,59]. In addition, this conjugation has allowed us to determine the colocalization of BMP-2 with BMPRIa while retaining the biological activity of BMP-2. These results indicate that the BMP-2-QDot®s conjugation can be used to observe BMP-2’s activity, allowing future studies to determine aberrant BMP-2 signaling in diseases such as osteoporosis and osteosarcoma. In addition, although studies measure phosphorylation of Smads to determine BMP-2 activity, here, we use the von Kossa assay to measure bone mineralization as the readout of BMP-2 signaling, as multiple other pathways may be involved, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and Wnt signaling [62,63]. The von Kossa assay measures calcium produced after osteogenesis and as demonstrated by equal cell counts in each condition and the colocalization of BMP-2-QDot®s and BMPRIa, we confirm that our conjugate is indeed functional (Figures 4 and 5).\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1208 10 of 13\nThe von Kossa assay can detect more mineralization due to cell death, however, this is unlikely as the cell number is similar in each condition (Figure 5). To confirm the biological activity of the BMP-2-Qdot® analog, future studies should investigate downstream signaling pathways, such as activation of regulatory Smads and osteogenic genes via Western blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, D.H., V.V., and A.N.; methodology, D.H., V.V., K.B., and A.N.; validation, D.H. and A.N.; formal analysis, D.H.; investigation, D.H.; resources, A.N.; data curation, D.H. and H.W.D.; writing—original draft preparation, D.H.; writing—review and editing, D.H., V.V., H.W.D., and A.N.; visualization, D.H., H.W.D., and A.N.; supervision, A.N.; project administration, A.N.

QDot®s are more photostable, brighter, and photobleach less than other fluorescent dyes. These characteristics give them the potential to be used in many biological applications. The shells of QDot®s are coated with functional groups, such as carboxylate and organic groups, allowing them to couple to peptides/proteins and be used for real-time imaging and high-resolution microscopy. Here, we utilize Quantum Dot®s and Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 (BMP-2) to create a BMP-2-QDot®s conjugate. BMP-2 is a growth factor that drives many processes such as cardiogenesis, neural growth, and osteogenesis. Despite its numerous roles, the trafficking and uptake of BMP-2 into cells is not well-established, especially during progression of diseases. The results presented here demonstrate for the first time a fluorescent BMP-2 analog that binds to the BMP-receptors (BMPRs), remains biologically active, and is stable for long time periods. Previous attempts to develop a biological BMP-2 analog with Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or nanodiamonds lacked data on the analog’s stability. Furthermore, these analogs did not address whether they can signal within the cell by binding to the BMPRs or were mediated by non-stable conjugates.",
