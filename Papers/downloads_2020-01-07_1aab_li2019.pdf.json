      "text" : "Carbon fiber (CF) is an ideal reinforcement for polymer composites because of its excellent mechanical properties and light weight. Therefore, CF reinforced materials have been widely applied in aviation, military, and automotive industries [1–3]. The predominant properties of CF reinforced materials have a great relationship with the interfacial interaction between CF and the resin. However, chemically inert pristine CF presents low surface energy that leads to low interfacial bonding with the polymer matrix [4]. This property limits the real potential of CF, and could further affect the properties of the composite materials [5,6].\nThe CF surface modification has been extensively studied for enhancing the interfacial interactions between CF and polymer resin matrix. Those modifications mainly consist of wet chemical modification, dry chemical modification and multi-scale nanoparticle coating\nmodification. Wet and dry chemical modifications [7,8] could promote the surface roughness and introduce the active functional groups on CF surface. However, those treatments could induce pits and flaws on the CF surface which led to crack initiation with an earlier and easier propagation [9,10]. Multi-scale methods such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) could improve the roughness and the polarity of the CF surface [11,12]. But utilizing these methods could not effectively enhance the interfacial reactivity between CF and polymer resin matrix due to the absence of functional groups on the CF surface [13]. Though CVD can be used as efficiently multi-scale method [14,15], some issues including high temperature, toxic and expensive catalysts utilized in the CVD treatment restricted its applications.\nElectrodeposition method (EDM) is a fast, simple, inexpensive and environmentally friendly method for preparing nanomaterials [16–18]. EDM could attach nanoparticles on the substrate with controllable morphology and size of nanoparticles (NPs) [19].

For noble metal NPs electrodeposition, only a small amount of noble salt could achieve the desired results [21,22]. Thiols link the active group to the silver or gold surfaces through a strong bond which is an effective way to introduce functional groups on the substrate [23]. This method endows the metal surface with new properties, such as hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity as well as other specific functionalities [24,25]. Therefore, combining EDM and “Ag–S″ bonds way provides a promising surface modification approach, which could overcome the deficiencies of the aforementioned methods.\nIn this paper, a novel strategy to functionalize CF surface by using EDM and “Ag–S″ bonds introduction is reported. Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were coated uniformly on the CF surface by EDM, followed by introducing 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4MBA) or 4-aminothiophenol (4ATP) via “Ag–S″ bonds to functionalize the Ag NP surface (Fig. 1a). The interfacial property and the mechanical property of functionalized CF were studied. The properties of CF composites modified by wet chemical methods were compared."

The chemical composition and the surface elements of the CF were performed by X -ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, ThermoFisher, USA). The Raman spectroscopy was recorded using a laser confocal Raman Microspectrometer (Renishaw, Gloucestershire, UK) with diode laser at 532 nm. The advancing contact angle of CF was performed on a dynamic contact angle analysis test (DCAT-21, Germany). Deionized water and diiodomethane were the test liquids as the polar solvent and the dispersive solvent, respectively. The single-fiber tensile testing machine (5569, Instron, USA) was used to assess the tensile strength of CF based on ASTMD3379-75. In order to evaluate the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) between CF and resin, the microdroplet (single fiber composite) test was operated by pulling a single CF out from cured resin droplets [27]. The schematic of microdroplet test is shown in Fig. 1b and c. The microdroplet samples were prepared by using silicone resin,\nand 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole as curing agent. They were mixed in a 100:32 mass ratio. The composites were cured for 2 h at 90, 120, 150 and 180 °C, respectively. The maximum load to pull out the CF from resin microdroplet was measured to calculate the IFSS values using the following equation:\n= dl IFSS F (1)\nwhere F is the maximum load recorded, d and l are the CF diameter and the embedded length, respectively."

      "text" : "XPS was used to investigate the chemical nature of carbon fiber with different treatments. The XPS spectra and the quantitative analysis are shown in Fig. 2a and Table S1. It was found that the surface composition of CF coated Ag NPs changed substantially. The elements on the pristine CF are C and O, as revealed in the XPS spectra. After treated by Ag NPs, the Ag 3d peaks were observed and the content of Ag atoms for Ag@CF, 4MBA-Ag@CF and 4ATP-Ag@CF was 1.89%, 2.1% and 1.06%, respectively. Fig. 2b presents the high-resolution XPS scan spectrum of C 1s for 4ATP-Ag@CF. The C 1s spectrum reveals the C–N peak at 285.9 eV because of the introduction of 4ATP [27], suggesting the successful grafting of 4ATP on the Ag@CF surface. The sulfur spectra of 4ATP-Ag@CF are fitted by S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 doublets at around 161.9 and 162.3 eV (Fig. 2c). The peak at 161.9 eV is attributed to the formation of a thiolate−Ag bond. The Ag 3d regions in the XPS data of Ag@CF show the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 ionizations at 367.5 and 373.6 eV (Fig. S1a), which suggests that the majority of the silver atoms on the surfaces are the Ag (0) state [28]. On the contrary, 4MBAAg@CF shows Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 ionizations at 367.9 and 373.9 eV (Fig. S1b), respectively. Similarly, 4ATP bound Ag NPs show two peaks for Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 at 367.8 and 373.8 eV (Fig. S1c). The Ag 3d5/ 2 and 3d3/2 ionization energies of 4MBA-Ag@CF and 4ATP-Ag@CF are higher than Ag@CF. It indicates that outer Ag atoms bound with thiol. The XPS results further confirm the –NH2 and –COOH were introduced via thiolate–Ag bond successfully.\nRaman spectroscopy images effectively characterized the defects of CF as illustrated in Fig. 3. CF exhibits the D band at around 1369 cm−1 and the G band at 1589 cm−1. The D band is assigned to the defects and disorder, and the G band is related to the C–C stretching on the graphitic structures of carbon. The intensity ratio ID/IG of D band and G band is related to the defective degree of CF surface [29]. Compared to the pristine CF, whose ID/IG ratio is 0.983, the ratios of CF-COOH and CF-NH2 are significantly increased to 1.041 and 1.118, respectively. It indicates that the ratio of graphitic domains is decreased and the ratio of O or N elements is increased. Furthermore, the ratio ID/IG of 1.129 for the Ag@CF means that the Ag NPs should be covalently attached to the CF surface [30]. The Raman signal of the molecule on the rough Ag NPs surface could be magnified, which could obtain surface-enhanced\nRaman scattering (SERS). The Ag NPs based materials are usually used as SERS substrates [30–33]. Therefore, the SERS of the 4MBA-Ag@CF and the 4ATP-Ag@CF are shown in Fig. 3e–f. The S–H stretching band around 2500 cm−1 is not observed. However, the appearance of “Ag–S″ bonds stretching is observed at 225 and 222 cm−1 [33]. The results indicate that 4ATP or 4MBA is linked on Ag NPs surface successfully."

      "text" : "The SEM images of pristine CF, CF-COOH, Ag@CF are shown in Fig. 4a–d, respectively. Significant differences of the surface morphology can be observed between the pristine CF and the CF-COOH. Shallow parallel grooves spread on the pristine fiber sparsely, along the longitudinal direction. After acidification, some grooves on the CFCOOH surface become more intensive and deeper. This means that nitric acid treatment produced defects on the CF surface.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 4c and d, electrodeposited Ag NPs on the CF surface are observed to be at a scale range from 26.67 to 180.61 nm (Fig. S2). The Ag NPs on the CF surface increased the surface roughness. The roughness plays a vital role in the improvement of interfacial adhesion. For 4MBA-Ag@CF and 4ATP-Ag@CF, their differences with Ag@CF cannot be recognized from SEM images as shown in Fig. S3."

      "text" : "Differences in chemical environment and topography have a significant influence on surface energy. The improvement of the CF surface energy could increase the interface adhesion [34–36]. The advancing contact angle (θ), surface energy (γ), disperse part (γd), polar part (γp) of samples are shown in Table 1 and Table S2. As shown in Table S2, compared with the pristine CF, the CF-COOH and CF-NH2 had 104.8% and 103.5% increase in the polar part, 7.1% and 5.4% increase in the dispersive part. The abundant oxygen functional groups within CFCOOH and amine groups within CF-NH2 could contribute to the improvement in the polar part of the surface energy. Compared with the surface energy of the pristine CF, the value of Ag@CF is increased by 18.3% due to the improved roughness by Ag NPs. However, the results of 4MBA-Ag@CF and 4ATP-Ag@CF were enhanced 38.6% and 32.72%. This increased surface energy may be generated by the polar functional groups. Furthermore, the aromatic segment within the structure of the 4MBA-Ag@CF and 4ATP-Ag@CF plays a vital role in the surface energy of CF [24]."

      "heading" : "3.4. Tensile strength testing",
      "text" : "The tensile strength (TS) of single fiber was investigated to reveal the effects of surface modification on the inherent mechanical properties of CFs. The TS of CF treated with different methods were compared. The tensile strength is decreased from 3.09 GPa for pristine CF to 2.63 GPa for CF-COOH (Fig. S4a). The tensile strength of CF-NH2 is further decreased by 20.06%, compared with pristine CF. It could be caused by the defects on the treated CF. The results indicated that the\nacidification and amination treatment has a negative effect on the carbon fiber property. As Fig. 5a reveals, the tensile strength values of Ag@CF, 4MBA-Ag@CF and 4ATP-Ag@CF were 2.99, 3.04 and 3.01 GPa, respectively. Compared to pristine CF, the values of 4MBAAg@CF and 4ATP-Ag@CF showed negligible decreases of 1.61% and 2.59%, respectively. The results of tensile strength testing imply that different functional treatments have obvious influences on the CF mechanical properties. The defects introduced by acidic etching reduced the tensile strength [1,7]. However, the mechanical property of CF treated with EDM and “Ag–S″ bonds was almost not affected."

      "heading" : "3.5. Interfacial property of CF composites",
      "text" : "The interfacial properties have a major effect on the mechanical properties of the final composites. The interfacial bonding strength between the matrix and the studied fibers was evaluated by the IFSS, and the IFSS results are shown in Fig. 5b and Fig. S4b. The IFSS results of pristine CF, CF-COOH, CF-NH2, Ag@CF, 4MBA-Ag@CF and 4ATPAg@CF are 34.36, 37.71, 39.81, 41.49, 41.61 and 45.37MPa, respectively. Compared with the pristine CF, the IFSS of CF-COOH and CFNH2 are increased by 9.75% and 15.86%, respectively. However, as expected, the IFSS of 4MBA-Ag@CF and 4ATP-Ag@CF exhibit greater enhancement of 21.10% and 32.04%, respectively. The increment for IFSS value is superior to the CFs functionalized by chemical plating, which was only 22.9% [33]. On one hand, the Ag NPs deposited by EDM are uniform at the nanoscale. The attachment of Ag NPs improves the surface energy as the mentioned above and thus leads to a better adhesion with resin matrix via the mechanical interlocking [37]. On the other hand, the epoxy moieties of the resin substrate could react with amine [31]. The IFSS results reveal that the interfiacial property of 4ATP-Ag@CF is higher than the others. The incorporation of 4ATP on the CF surface could provide an amino which act as reactive anchoring site for the epoxy group of silicone resin matrix, shown in Fig. 5c. It's suggesting that the improvement of interfacial property is caused by the combination of Ag NPs and amino group. When the resin matrix of the CF composite was instead by epoxy resin, the same result were obtained as shown in Fig. S5. Therefore, this combined EDM and “Ag–S″ bonds treatments can guarantee to increase the interfacial property of CF composite which the resin matrix contain epoxy group.\nThe CF surface morphologies after IFSS experiments were observed (Fig. 6a–d). For the pristine CF, minimal resin fragment remained on the surface after debonding. It means that the microdroplets were debonded smoothly due to the weak van der Waals force reaction between CF and resin matrix (Fig. 6a). The limited number of bonds between CF surface and resin matrix leads to a weak adhesion of pristine CF composite (Fig. 6e). For CF-COOH and CF-NH2, there is few resin remaining on the fiber surface, indicating poor interfacial properties with silicone resin (Fig. S6). However, for 4ATP-Ag@CF, the resin fragment on the surface can be observed clearly (Fig. 6d). The Ag NPs, which can be observed obviously on the CF surface, contributed to modulus gradient diffusing between the CF and low modulus silicone resin matrix, thus resulting in a decline in the localized stress concentrations. The treatment of CF with Ag NPs covered with amino group can provide further\ninterfacial interaction, with not only van der Waals force but also chemical bonding. As shown in Fig. 6f, the amino group from CF surface could react with the epoxy groups of silicone resin, thus improved the interfacial adhesion of 4ATP-Ag@CF composite [38]. Therefore, as the arrow pointed, the remained residued silicone resin fragments which remaining on the 4ATP-Ag@CF surface indicates that stronger interfacial shear strength was formed."

These results demonstrate that the IFSS of 4ATP-Ag@CF and 4ATPAg@CF composites were 21.10% and 32.04% higher than pristine CF composites, which was caused by the formation of mechanical interlock through chemical bonding. EDM and “Ag–S″ bond treatments not only maintained the mechanical properties of CF, but also enhanced the interfacial performance of CF significantly. Combination of EDM and “Ag–S″ bonds is not only convenient to apply but also highly effective to improve the interfacial properties of CF and resin matrix."

In this work, a new approach combining electrodeposition method (EDM) and “Ag–S′′ bonds was applied to fabricate functional CF-based composites while preserving the mechanical properties of CFs. Silver nanoparticles were first attached on the CF surface by EDM. Then 4-aminothiophenol or 4-mercaptobenzoic acid was linked to Ag surface by Ag–S bonds to incorporate different functional groups onto the fiber surface. The interfacial shear strength was improved pronouncedly while the tensile strength was maintained consistent. The interfacial shear strength of the CFs after functionalized was increased 21.10% and 32.04%, respectively. However, the tensile strength of them decreased no more than 3%. With improved properties, these nanocomposites have potential applications for aerospace, transportation, electronics and other fields.",
