Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and Gum arabic (GA) are respectively used to stabilize the nanofluid. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) methods were used to characterize the prepared nanofluid samples. Experiments were performed to evaluate the viscosity of water– CNT/magnetite nanofluid in the shear rate range of 1–100 s−1, volume fraction range of 0.5-1.5%, and magnetic field strength range of 0–480 mT. It was found that the presence of an external magnetic field causes an increase in the viscosity of the water– CNT/magnetite nanofluid. In addition, the results depicted that the viscosity of the nanofluid augments by boosting the concentration of the nano-materials. Moreover, it was reported that increasing the magnetic field strength to more than 360 mT has a negligible influence on the augmentation of nanofluid viscosity. Furthermore, the nonNewtonian shear thinning behavior was depicted because of the decrease in viscosity with intensifying the shear rates.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Nanofluid is a novel class of fluids aimed at modifying the thermal characteristics of common coolants [1,2]. Studies have shown that the use of nanofluids results in the improvement of the performance of heat exchangers [3,4] and cooling of electronic components [5,6]. The methods for the heat transfer modification can include by the employment of porous medium [7,8], the use of magnetic fields [8,9], and changes in the physical properties using nano-materials [10,11]. There have been a few studies on rheological behavior of nanofluid when the nanofluid subjected to an external force. In other words, the simultaneous usage of a nanofluid and a force such as a magnetic field to improve the thermal characteristics of a heat exchanger has been less discussed in the literature [12]. Naphon and Wiriyasart [13] studied the MHD laminar nanofluid flow in micro-finned tube, experimentally showing a higher heat transfer for a higher concentration of nanomaterials and intensity of magnetic field. Thermal properties of Ag–Water were measured experimentally by Valdéz et al. [14]. They obtained the thermal diffusivity from their experimental data. Naphon et al. [15] investigated the magnetic field influences on the hydrothermal properties of nanofluids flowing inside a spirally pipe. They found that the application of a magnetic field with the strengths of 0.12, 0.18 and 0.23 µT, respectively, leads to a higher Nusselt number by 16.97%, 25.83%, 31.15%. Sha et al. [16] assessed the influences of temperature and magnetic field strength on the performance metrics of MHD flow of water–magnetite nanofluid. It was observed that the convection coefficient of water–magnetite nanofluid increases by applying a constant uniformmagnetic field. Furthermore, it was reported that boosting the intensity of magnetic field results in a lower convection coefficient. Shahsavar et al. [17] studied experimentally and performed an artificial neural network (ANN) analysis on the conductivity and viscosity of the combination of Al2O3 with paraffin based nanofluid containing oleic acid surfactant. The influences of temperature, nano-materials concentration and surfactant concentration on the findings were studied. They showed a shear thinning characteristics of the nanofluid. The ANN predicted the thermal conductivity and viscosity with high accuracy.\nAs also discussed in the literature [18], compared with the conductivity, there has been a fewer studies working specifically on the dynamic viscosity of various nanofluids. Heidari et al. [19] employed a huge number of experimental data from different publications (1490 data points) and employed a novel ANN model using Levenberg–Marquardt training algorithm. The nanofluid viscosity introduced as a function of temperature, nano-materials size and volume fraction and the base fluid viscosity. They claimed the maximum deviation of 6.44.% between the model and experimental data. Wang et al. [18] studied on the viscosity of magnetic nanofluid under various magnetic field magnitudes. They presented that the viscosity enhances for a higher magnetic field, higher concentration of nano-material and lower temperature. Amani et al. [20] investigated on the viscosity of manganese ferrite–water nanofluid subjected to different magnetic fields and showed significant increase of nanofluid viscosity for a higher nano-material concentration, lower temperature and higher magnitude of magnetic field. They developed a correlation to predict the viscosity in terms of temperature, nano-material and magnetic field characteristics. Esfe et al. [21] studied experimentally on the viscosity of TiO2-water nanofluid and performed an ANN to predict the viscosity in terms of temperature and concentration of nano-materials. They claimed that the maximum deviation of the predicted viscosity by ANN from the experimental data is 0.5%. In another study, Esfe et al. [22] studied experimentally on rheological properties and viscosity of hybrid anti-freezing nanofluid including MWCNT and TiO2. The base fluid includes 70% water and 30% EG. Different temperatures and concentrations of hybrid nano-materials are examined. They showed 83% enhancement in the viscosity at the volume fraction of 0.85% and temperature of 10 ◦C.\nMagnetic nanofluids or ferrofluids are a special class of nanofluids that demonstrate both thy fluid and magnetic aspects. A distinctive specification of magnetic nanofluids is that they can be controlled using an external magnetic field. These type of nanofluids contain magnetic nanoparticles such as Fe2O3, Fe3O4, nickel and cobalt. Several studies have revealed that the application of magnetic field causes an increase in both the thermal conductivity [23–25] and viscosity [26–28] of magnetic nanofluids, the first one being desirable and the later one being undesirable.\nThe aqueous suspension of CNT/magnetite is among the magnetic nanofluids that have attracted the attention of many scientists in recent years. It contains both the CNT nano-material having high thermal conductivity and magnetite nan-material having high magnetic property. Literature survey reveals that there are only two studies on the rheological behavior of CNT/magnetite nanofluids in the presence of a magnetic field [29,30]. Felicia and Philip [29] evaluated the viscosity behavior of an oil based magnetic nanofluid containing magnetite nano-materials with volume fraction of 0.088 and CNT nanoparticles with weigh concentration of 0.5%. Shahsavar et al. [30] investigated the effect of magnetic field on the rheological behavior of water–CNT/magnetite nanofluid containing 0.9 vol.% magnetite and 0.9–1.35 vol.% CNT nano-materials. So there is a lack of data on this issue. This investigation is performed to fulfill this research gap. A magnetorheometer is used to measure the viscosity behavior of water–CNT/magnetite nanofluid in the nano-material concentration range of 0.5–1.5% and magnetic field strength range of 0–480 mT."

The measurements were performed in the shear rate ranged from 1 to 100 s−1, magnetic field strength range of 0–480 mT and nano-material volume fraction range of 0.5–1.5%.

      "text" : "The water–magnetite nanofluid is synthesized with the method presented by Berger et al. [36] and utilized by\nShahsavar et al. [30–33]. The materials needed to make this nanofluid are:\n• 39.76 g FeCl2.4H2O in 100 ml of hydrochloric acid solution 2M (Fig. 1a). • 67.58 g FeCl3.6H2O in 250 ml of hydrochloric acid solution 2M (Fig. 1b). • 50 ml of aqueous ammonia solution of 25% in one liter of water. • An aqueous solution of 25% TMAH.\nFirst, one milliliter of FeCl2.4H2O solution and 4 ml of FeCl3.6H2O solution were mixed in a beaker and gently stirred using a magnetic mixer for one minute. Then, 50 mm of ammonia solution was added slowly and dropped by a burette in 8 min. The velocity of the magnetic mixer was raised at the beginning of this step and brought to 1000 rpm. After the completion of ammonia, the magnetic mixer was turned off and the beaker was placed on a magnet to enhance the black precipitate sedimentation. After a few minutes, black sediments on the bottom of the beaker and a clear solution is observed on the sediment. The additional solution is evacuated and then the sediment in the bottom of beaker is centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 1 min results in a dark sludge remained at the bottom of the centrifuge containers. Finally, ammonia and water in the centrifuge containers are emptied and then 8 mm of tetramethylammonium hydroxide is evenly fed between the centrifuge containers and mixed. Subsequently, the contents of the containers are poured into a beaker and used for a magnetic mixer for 30 min. To test the magnetic properties, a permanent magnet is placed next to the container containing nanofluid. An image of the nanofluid is made and its behavior in the attendance of a magnet is presented in Fig. 2. As can be seen, magnetite nanoparticles are absorbed toward the magnet, and it is concluded that the nanofluid is magnetized.\nAfter preparing the water–magnetite nanofluid with the above method, it is essential to ensure that the synthesized particles are magnetite and then determine the particle size. The XRD test is used to check the crystal structure of the magnetite particles. The XRD is a non-destructive, multi-application method that provides information on chemical compositions and crystalline structure of natural and industrial materials. Each crystal has its own unique X-ray pattern, which may be used as a fingerprint to determine its identity. So far, the pattern of more than 75000 mineral and organic components are collected. Using this database, the combination of each substance can be specified using the search and matching method. The broadest use of XRD is in detecting crystalline compounds based on their diffraction pattern. The\nXRD pattern of the prepared particles by the above method is shown in Fig. 3. Comparing this pattern with the standard pattern of magnetite particles [34,35] shows that the patterns are consistent and, consequently, the particles produced\nare magnetite. It should be noted that the XRD test was carried out by an expert at the Institute for Color Science and Technology Research, Tehran.\nTo check the particles size, the DLS test is used which is the only physical method measuring the particle size in a solution quickly with little preparation. If the laser light is shifted to a small particle, the size of which is small compared to the wavelength of light (less than 250 nm), the light is scattered by the particle in all directions. When a laser beam hits moving particles with a given frequency, light is propagated at a different frequency and oscillates in the phase of emitted light. The change in the frequency of transmitted light is related by the particle size. The intensity of the fluctuation of the emitted light is measurable by a suitable detector. The intensity of the fluctuation of the emitted light depends on the speed of molecular penetration in the solvent directly. By knowing the viscosity of the ambient, the intensity of these oscillations is used to determine the diameter of the sample. The diameter obtained with this method is related to a sphere with a transmission coefficient equivalent to measurement particle. The experimental results of the DLS of the prepared water–magnetite method are presented in Fig. 4. According to the obtained results, the diameter of 10% of nanoparticles is smaller than 19.3 nm, 50% of nanoparticles is smaller than 23.3 nm, and 90% of nanoparticles is smaller than 33.5 nm.\nNanofluids stability is considerably important in order to maintain their thermophysical properties after the synthesis over long periods of time. In the present work, the zeta potential technique is employed to evaluate the stability of synthesized nanofluid samples. It is the electric potential in the interfacial double layer at the location of the slipping plane relative to a point in the bulk fluid away from the interface [34]. Nanofluids with Zeta Potentials of greater than +30 mV or less than −30 mV are considered strongly stable [34]. The findings of Zeta Potential test are demonstrated in Fig. 5. According to the obtained results, the prepared nanofluid has Zeta Potentials less than −40 mV and consequently, it has acceptable stability."

First, 0.25 gr of GA was poured into 100 gr of water and the solution was mixed with a magnetic mixer for 30 min. Then, 1 g of CNT was added to the solution and ultrasonic was performed for 40 min. It should be noted that the results of Garg et al. [37] showed that for a higher ultrasonic duration, the CNTs break down and precipitate and the nanofluid becomes unstable."

As a result of the reaction between the TMAH and GA, magnetite particles were deposited on the CNTs. The TEM image of the proposed hybrid nanofluid is presented in Fig. 6. This figure clearly shows the magnetite nanoparticles to CNTs. In the presence of a magnetic field, the magnetite nanoparticles align their magnetic moments with the magnetic field direction. The spin of the magnetite nanoparticles leads to the rotation of the CNTs and, consequently, the CNTs are arranged and their contacts increase. Parmar et al. [38] used this method to put magnetite nanoparticles on carbon nanofibers. They reported that, in the attendance of a 5000 mT magnetic field, the adsorbed magnetic nanoparticles are spatially aligned with carbon nanofibers."

      "text" : "Fig. 7 illustrates the dynamic viscosity of water–CNT/magnetite nanofluid against the shear rate in terms of magnetic field strength for different volume fractions. It is worth mentioning that the magnetic field direction is perpendicular to\nthe rheometer parallel plates. It is clear that for a given volume fraction of hybrid nanofluid, applying an external magnetic field causes a higher viscosity of the hybrid nanofluid which augments by intensifying the magnetic field strength. This was also reported by Felicia and Philip [29] and Shahsavar et al. [30]. At the shear rate of 1 s−1, the application of magnetic field with strength of 480 mT leads to 21399.02% and 23398.76% increase in the viscosity of water–CNT/magnetite hybrid nanofluid with volume fraction of 0.5% and 1.5% in comparison with the case of without magnetic field, while the amount of increase for the shear rate of 100 s−1 is 1543.02% and 1712.67%, respectively. As mentioned before, in the attendance of a magnetic field, the magnetite nano-materials rotate to align their magnetic moments with the magnetic field direction. As a result, the CNTs move along the magnetic field regularly. This phenomenon leads to the formation of chainlike structures of magnetite nano-materials and CNTs. By increasing the magnetic field strength, these networks become thicker results in a higher viscosity. The SEM image of the water–CNT/magnetite nanofluid in the presence of magnetic field is shown in Fig. 8. The magnetic field can play a role in increasing the viscosity to a certain extent. At the magnetic field strength beyond 360 mT, the impact of the magnetic field on the viscosity is not considerable. Moreover, Fig. 7 demonstrates that the viscosity of samples decline (non-Newtonian shear thinning pattern) until creation of the plateau (Newtonian pattern) with and without the magnetite field. The shear thinning effect may be due to the possible deagglomeration of bundled CNTs and magnetite nano-materials or realignment in the direction of the shearing force, resulting in less viscous drag [37,39]. A greater degree of non-Newtonian behavior is shown for a higher nanofluid volume fraction [40–54].\nFig. 9 illustrates the variation of viscosity against the shear rate for different nanofluid concentrations and magnetic field strengths. The zoomed-in versions of the graphs are presented at the right side of the paper. As can be seen, at a given magnetic field strength, augmenting the nanofluid concentration results in a higher viscosity. The non-Newtonian behavior of the proposed nanofluids is also observed in Fig. 9. At higher magnetic field strengths, the difference between the viscosity for different volume fractions decreases. This phenomenon is due to the dominance of the electromagnetic force on the viscous force. Moreover, when the magnetic field is applied, increasing the shear rate has a higher influence on the viscosity, which increases the slope of the curve. The slight decrease in the reduction of viscosity for a higher shear rate is due to the breakdown of the bond and eventually, the reduction of small clusters. Since the shear rate is proportional to the reduction in the number of clusters, the dynamic viscosity decreases with the collapse of clusters."

      "text" : "In this paper, the effects of magnetic field on the rheological behavior of water–CNT/magnetite hybrid nanofluid were assessed experimentally. The impacts of magnetic field strength were investigated compared with the case of without magnetic field. In addition, the concentration influence on the viscosity were assessed. It can be concluded that the presence of magnetic field results in an augmentation in the viscosity and the amount of enhancement augments for a higher intensity of the magnetic field. For a magnetic field strength higher than 360 mT, its influence on the viscosity is ignorable. Moreover, all the studied samples present the non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior."

    "abstractText" : "This study aims at experimentally investigating the influence of magnetic field on the rheological behavior of water–carbon nanotube (CNT)/magnetite (Fe3O4) nanofluid. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and Gum arabic (GA) are respectively used to stabilize the nanofluid. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) methods were used to characterize the prepared nanofluid samples. Experiments were performed to evaluate the viscosity of water– CNT/magnetite nanofluid in the shear rate range of 1–100 s−1, volume fraction range of 0.5-1.5%, and magnetic field strength range of 0–480 mT. It was found that the presence of an external magnetic field causes an increase in the viscosity of the water– CNT/magnetite nanofluid. In addition, the results depicted that the viscosity of the nanofluid augments by boosting the concentration of the nano-materials. Moreover, it was reported that increasing the magnetic field strength to more than 360 mT has a negligible influence on the augmentation of nanofluid viscosity. Furthermore, the nonNewtonian shear thinning behavior was depicted because of the decrease in viscosity with intensifying the shear rates. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
