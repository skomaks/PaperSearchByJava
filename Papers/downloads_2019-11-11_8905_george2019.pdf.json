The efficacy of many drugs in their micro/macro formulations is shown to have poor bioavailability and pharmacokinetics after oral administration. To overcome this predicament, use of natural/synthetic biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have gained prominence in the field of nanomedicine for targeted drug delivery to improve biocompatibility, bioavailability, safety, enhanced permeability, better retention time and lower toxicity. For drug delivery, it is essential to have biodegradable nanoparticle formulations for safe and efficient transport and release of drug at the intended site. Moreover, depending on the target organ, a suitable biodegradable polymer can be selected as the drug-carrier for target specific as well as for sustained drug delivery. The aim of this review is to present the current status and scope of natural biodegradable polymers as well as some emerging polymers with special characteristics as suitable carriers for drug delivery applications. The most widely preferred preparation methods are discussed along with their characterization using different analytical techniques. Further, the review highlights significant features of methods developed using natural polymers for drug entrapment and release studies."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "With an unprecedented growth of research in the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology, there is an increasing optimism that it can bring about significant advancement in field of medicine for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. This includes in vitro and in vivo diagnostics, production of superior biocompatible material, nutraceuticals and drug delivery. The major reason for the interest in nanoparticles (NPs) for medical purpose is due to their unique features such as large surface to mass ratio, quantum properties and their ability to adsorb or act as carrier for other substances (De Jong and Borm, 2008; Ferrari, 2005). Amalgamation of polymer science with nano technology has brought about a new dimension in the field of drug delivery, food preservation, packaging, tissue engineering, nano-implants and biomedical engineering. Although NPs are characterized as particles with size ≤100 nm, in the context of nano particle formulations for drug delivery it should be considered as a nano scale system of 100–1000 nm size. This is mainly because it consists of at least two components; one of which is the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the other a carrier (European Technology Platform for Nanomedicine, 2005). In this regard use of polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) for targeted drug delivery has garnered much attention as they significantly\nimprove the therapeutic value of various water soluble and insoluble drugs as well as various biologically active compounds. They help in improving their bioavailability, safety and biocompatibility, reduction in toxicity while maintaining therapeutic effects, enhanced permeability cum absorption and an adjustable retention time. These nanomedicines are usually in the form of nanocapsules or nanospheres where in the former case the drug is encapsulated within a polymeric cavity while in the latter, the drug is physically dispersed in a polymeric matrix (Soppimath et al., 2001). The successful clinical translation from macro to micro to nano drug delivery systems has led to the evolution of controlled drug release, overcoming pharmacological limitations with substantial advantages over conventional dosage forms (Kamaly et al., 2016). The proper formation of nano drug delivery system depends on the target organ, the desired drug and its compatibility with the biodegradable polymer.\nThe capability of polymeric nanomedicines to reach the target organ is influenced by its particle size, surface charge distribution, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. The size of PNPs plays an important role in crossing different biological barriers to reach the target site (Brannon-Peppas and Blanchette, 2012). Their surface charge plays an important role in determining whether they remain in the systemic flow or interact with the cell membrane (Feng, 2004). For targeted drug\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2019.03.011 Received 21 December 2018; Received in revised form 4 March 2019; Accepted 5 March 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author.

Thus, conventional PNPs are modified with different substances so that they do not get rapidly opsonized from the body by the fixed macrophages of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (Brigger et al., 2012). The desired nanomedicine with a suitable polymer-drug combination is usually achieved by trial and error method. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a protein and a well-characterized tumour-suppressor gene that is lost in prostate cancer can be restored through messengerRNA (mRNA) by encapsulating within biodegradable polymer–lipid hybrid nanoparticles coated with a polyethylene glycol shell. This helps in efficient re-introduction of PTEN mRNA into the systemic circulation for effective cancer treatment (Islam et al., 2018). The encapsulation of drugs within the polymer is in a more advanced stage compared to other nanoparticle system (Van Vlerken et al., 2007). The molecular weight of the polymer has a significant impact on the drug release mechanism of the NPs. Higher the molecular weight of the polymer, higher is the retention time of the drug in the systemic circulation (Dhandayuthapani, 2011). Biodegradable PNPs are widely used in drug delivery research as they efficiently deliver the drug at the target site and thus increase the therapeutic benefit with minimum side effects. Since last several years high molecular weight biodegradable polymers (HMWBP) such as heparin, hyaluronic acid, dextran, pullulan etc based NPs have played a major part as suitable carriers for drugs, proteins and nucleic acids (Liu et al., 2008). However, these HMWBP based NPs degrade slowly in vivo leading to risk of accumulation in the tissues (Nakamura et al., 1992). As a result, low molecular weight biodegradable polymer (LMWBP) has gained considerable attention as potential delivery systems due to their higher permeability, solubility, and association efficiency owing to their smaller particle size (Dipankar and Panchanan, 2010). The potential of hydrophobic Pt (IV) prodrugs prepared using NP platform with amphiphilic lipid-PEG, was competent to resist thiol-mediated detoxification through a glutathione-exhausting effect and thus gave substantial benefit towards safety and efficacy (Ling et al., 2019). Many a times there arises a need for the addition of surfactants and dispersants to maintain the stability of the NPs and to achieve a uniform particle size. The NPs thus obtained can be further processed according to the prerequisite conditions (Guterres et al., 1995; Guterres et al., 2000). Use of reagents such as D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) which is a derivative of vitamin E, greatly improves the permeability of drugs through cell membrane making it a compelling candidate to target cancer cells (Tao et al., 2013). Similarly, dopamine based modified nanoparticle-aptamer bioconjugates showed significant drug concentration on tumor sites with minimal side effects (Tao et al., 2016).\nNot all drugs are suitable for nanodrug delivery, especially the less potent drugs as it becomes difficult to administer them (Davis and Illum, 2002; Mohanraj and Chen, 2006; Orive, 2003). To liberate the drug agents to the specific target site at the right time in a safe and reproducible manner is the main challenge of drug delivery. The predominant route for drug administration is through oral routes or intravenous injections. But these methods have limited access over the drug release rate in the body as they show a tendency for immediate release of the drug (Behera et al., 2010). Present date has seen bench-tobedside translation of targeted controlled release of PNPs from the initial in vitro studies to successful in vivo investigations laying foundations for clinical trials in humans (Farokhzad et al., 2004; Farokhzad et al., 2006). The biodegradable polymers are broadly classified into two categories based on their origin, namely natural and synthetic as outlined in Fig. 1.\nNumerous reviews have been published on different biodegradable polymers expressing their unique properties and applications. Chitosan tops the list owing to its long existence in the field of drug delivery. Chitosan, its derivatives as well as hybrid polymers developed with the help of chitosan are finding applications in multiple areas such as cell encapsulation, wound dressing, gene/delivery, contact lenses and\nimplants (Shariatinia, 2019). Derivatized chitosan such as trimethyl chitosan has become popular in the field of vaccine delivery (Malik et al., 2018), while graphene incorporated hybrid chitosan has found a unique spot in stimuli responsive drug delivery owing to its distinct physical, chemical, mechanical and electrical properties (GoonehFarahani et al., 2019). A lot of emphasis has been put on protein based nanoparticles as they possess minimal toxicity and are found to be competent drug carriers (Tarhini et al., 2017; Verma et al., 2018). Among these nanoformulations, albumin has found a significant role amidst proteins (Hoogenboezem and Duvall, 2018), while gelatin which is also a type of protein has been extensively used for gene therapy (Madkhali et al., 2019).\nIn general, the reviews currently available in the literature deal with specific natural polymers in drug delivery and few others on multiple natural polymers. They give sufficient insight into popular polymers such as chitosan, albumin and gelatin; nevertheless information about some less cognizant polymers such as carrageenan, alginate and starch is currently limited. The present review covers all major natural polymers currently in use for drug delivery applications and those which are presently at different stages of clinical studies. Additionally, it provides information about impending polymers that are yet to be explored which may hold the key to opening newer dimensions in the field of drug delivery in future. Furthermore, the description of polymers along with information on different basic preparation techniques would help in determining which preparation method would be more suitable for a particular polymer-drug complex to provide maximum drug encapsulation efficiency."

      "heading" : "2. Natural biodegradable polymers",
      "text" : "Naturally occurring biodegradable polymers are widely used in drug delivery because of their abundance in nature, biodegradability, biocompatibility and lower toxicity. These include protein based polymers such as albumin, gelatin, soy, collagen and polysaccharides such as chitosan, agarose, dextran, hyaluronic acid, alginate, carrageenan and cyclodextrin. However, use of natural polymers as drug carriers is challenging because of their broad molecular weight distributions and batch-to-batch variability. The most widely used natural polymer for drug delivery is chitosan because of its property to blend with a variety of polymers and easy surface modification along with lower toxicity and non-immunogenic behavior showing significant compatibility with tissues and cells (Hu et al., 2013; Park et al., 2010). Chitosan coupled with folate acts as an excellent drug carrier, specifically targeted for\ncolorectal cancer since folic acid acts as an excellent targeting agent (Li et al., 2011a; Li et al., 2015). The efficiency of this potential molecule was further improved by cross-linking it with 1,3-diamino propane making it a superior drug carrier for targeted colorectal cancer therapy (Wang et al., 2015). Chitosan also blends exceptionally well with synthetic polymer PLGA, thus improving affinity of the formulation towards cancer cells (Wang et al., 2013a; Wang et al., 2016a). Another sought after natural polymer along with chitosan is alginate. It is an acid resistant polymer that is non-toxic and biocompatible with mucoadhesive properties and exhibits a unique property of gel formation in the presence of divalent cations such as Ca+2, Zn+2 or Ba+2 (Borges et al., 2006; Silva et al.,2006). On the other hand, recent research works have shown that the combined use of chitosan-alginate for targeted drug delivery provides best results owing to the versatility of chitosan and the acid-resistant property of alginate (Azevedo et al., 2014; Biswas et al., 2015; Li et al., 2007). Apart from these, other natural polymers used include starch (Ding et al., 2016), albumin (Jahanban-Esfahlan et al., 2016), galactomannan (Lesnichaya et al., 2010), carrageenan (Lesnichaya et al., 2010), guar gum (Das and Subuddhi, 2015), dextran (Katas et al., 2013), agarose (Gavasane and Pawar, 2014), zein-pectin (Dhanya et al., 2012), pullulan (Dionísio et al., 2013), gelatin (Cascone et al., 2002) and lignin (Myint et al., 2016). Nevertheless, these polymers have been less explored as compared to chitosan and alginate. Although various biodegradable polymers have shown success in several pre-clinical trials, very few passively targeted nanocarriers have been accepted for clinical use, while none of the actively targeted nanocarriers have gone further post clinical trials (Rosenblum et al., 2018). Therefore, it is important to explore new candidates from this family of polymers for specific targets and sustained drug release."

      "heading" : "2.1. Chitosan",
      "text" : "Chitosan is a polysaccharide found abundantly in nature next to cellulose. The history of chitosan dates back to the mid-19th century when the deacetylated form of the parent chitin polymer was studied in 1859 (Dodane and Vilivalam, 1998). It is obtained by partial deacetylation of chitin in alkaline solution (Subramanian et al., 2006). Chitosan has found wide application as a drug carrier due to its biocompatibility, nontoxicity, noncarcinogenic and antibacterial properties (Sun and Wan, 2007). It consists of 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose and 2-acetamido2-deoxy-D-glucose units linked with β-(1–4) bonds (Fig. 2a). It is susceptible to glycosidic hydrolysis by microbial enzymes in the colon as it undergoes assimilation by microorganisms leading to breakdown of the polymer back bone and subsequent reduction in the molecular weight.\nAs a result it loses the mechanical strength to hold on to the drug (Saboktakin et al., 2011). One major advantage of chitosan NPs is their quick uptake by cells due to its surface amine groups (David et al., 2015). Protonation of these amine groups on chitosan glucosamine monomers is facilitated at pH below 6.5 (pKa of chitosan), thus conferring cationic properties on chitosan (Jean et al., 2012). This enables it to interact with anionic components such as cell surface macromolecules and nucleic acids. The high positive charge on chitosan bestows it with mucoadhesive properties making it an ideal candidate for the delivery of drugs to mucosal tissues (Nagarajan et al., 2015). Two parameters that have a major influence on the biological and physiological properties of chitosan include degree of acetylation and crystallinity, and the molecular weight. Ionic gelation, complex coacervation, spray drying and emulsion cross-linking are methods generally employed for preparation of chitosan NPs. Of these, ionic gelation and complex coacervation are mild processes taking place majorly in aqueous environment. They are preferred over other methods as they help in the stability of drugs. The former involves gelation of chitosan by using an electrolyte such as tripolyphosphate (TPP), whereas the latter makes use of an anionic polymer such as alginate and carboxymethyl starch (CMS) (Saboktakin et al., 2011).\nRecent researches have shown a variety of novel modifications and applications of chitosan thereby increasing its overall value. This includes use of amphophilic chitosan derivatives for insulin delivery (Wang et al., 2017), formation of cisplatin mediated polyampholytic chitosan (Kang et al., 2017), PEGylation and fluorination of chitosan (Antoniraj et al., 2018; Belabassi et al., 2017) and modifying chitosan using folate and heptamethine cyanine especially for tumor-specific imaging and photodynamic therapy (Zhang et al., 2017). Solid-lipid NPs were formed by encapsulating nutraceuticals such as cinnamon and oregano within chitosan in combination with 5-fluorouracil as an effective treatment against cancer (Kamel et al., 2017). Drug delivery to the brain has always been a difficult task as the blood brain barrier does not permit easy cellular uptake to the brain. For this, antibody modified NPs have been prepared which seems to be a promising scheme for drug delivery to the brain (Gu et al., 2017). In another work redox-responsive nanocarriers have been developed for co-delivery of drug and gene using chitosan derivatives (Lin et al., 2017). A very recent work showed development of hollow chitosan/polyacrylic acid NPs of sub100 nm size as efficient carriers of drug molecules (Belbekhouche et al., 2018). Other promising NPs of glycol chitosan with hydrophobic moieties have demonstrated promising results for the release of doxorubicin during preclinical studies in tumor bearing mice (Park et al., 2006).

      "heading" : "2.2. Sodium alginate",
      "text" : "Sodium alginate or commonly known as alginate is widely used in food industries, bioengineering and in drug delivery. It is a water soluable salt of alginic acid, an anionic hydrophilic polysaccharide naturally occurring in all species of brown algae of the Phaeophyta family. Alginates show different structural and chemical properties depending on the seasonal and growth conditions of the algae. It is a linear biopolymer constituted of two uronic acids, 1,4-linked-β-Dmannuronic acid (M) and α-L-guluronic acid (G), making them anionic in nature owing to the presence of carboxylic groups. As shown in Fig. 2b, the G-blocks and the M-blocks strictly coexist in an alternating sequence where the diequatorial linkages connecting mannuronic acid residues in M-blocks can be assumed as a flat ribbon-like chain conformation in contrast to the diaxially linked guluronic acid residues leading to more rigid structures of the G-blocks. It has been reported that the rigidity of the structures increases along the series MG < MM < GG (Azevedo et al., 2014; Daemi and Barikani, 2012). The pKa value of alginic acid ranges from 3.4 to 4.4 depending on the type of alginate and salts present in it (Sankalia et al., 2007).\nThis polymer exhibits a unique property of gel formation in the presence of divalent cations such as calcium ions in aqueous medium or at low pH. The ionic interaction between the calcium ions and the guluronic acid residues cause alginate to form gels (Ghaffari et al., 2012). The drug delivery from alginate hydrogels is a pH-dependent phenomenon leading to targeted delivery. Alginate shrinks in a low pH environment (gastric environment) and the encapsulated drugs is not released in the stomach. On reaching the intestinal tract the pH increases and so does the degree of swelling of the polymer which facilitates its rapid disintegration and the subsequent release of the drug (Azhar and Olad, 2014). The intrinsic properties of the calcium-alginate gel beads make them one of the most widely used carriers for controlled release (Gong et al., 2011). On coating these beads with polymers of opposite charge such as chitosan improves its stability during storage and half-life in biological fluids (Azhar and Olad, 2014). Alginates have also been used in combination with other natural polymers such as carrageenan and gelatin (Mahdavinia et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016b). Alginate ferrogels have also been prepared as stimuli responsive drug delivery system which also has wide applications in tissue engineering fields (Kim et al., 2016). Alginate/calcium carbonate hybrid NPs have also been prepared that are capable of containing hydrophilic cum hydrophobic drug for multiple drug delivery which might become an effective platform for combination drug therapy (Wu et al., 2014). Alginate hydrogels are proficient to fit the contours of wound beds while providing a moist environment. They are also capable of absorbing large amount of liquid so as to reduce the frequency of dressing changes (Han et al., 2014). Calcium-alginate is also being considered as a new approach for vaccine therapy (Honda-Okubo et al., 2012). Aerosol OT™ – alginate nanoparticles formed via emulsion-crosslinking process have shown excellent results for enhanced cellular delivery of water soluble drugs like doxorubicin during preclinical trials (Chavanpatil et al., 2007). Major works in the field of drug delivery using alginate as a biopolymer are illustrated in Table 2. Alginate NPs are generally prepared by ionotropic gelation method and desolvation technique. The former method involves controlled gellification by counter ion induced aggregation while the latter employs the addition of an organic solvent to alginate under constant stirring to form a turbid solution (Sailaja et al., 2011)."

      "heading" : "2.3. Gelatin",
      "text" : "Gelatin, a protein material (Fig. 2c) is a naturally occurring biopolymer used in numerous household products in our daily life. It is obtained by controlled hydrolysis of the fibrous, insoluble protein, collagen, widely found as the major component of skin, bones and connective tissue. In terms of nanopharmaceutics, gelatin was considered as an interesting biodegradable base material in the early days of particle development because of its biodegradable and non‐toxic nature, apart from ease of chemical modification. Therefore it serves as a potential candidate for the preparation of colloidal drug delivery systems such as microspheres and NPs (Vandervoort and Ludwig, 2004).\nCommercially, gelatin is found in two types namely type A and type B. Type A is obtained by collagen undergone acid treatment while type B is obtained by alkaline treated collagen. This leads to a difference in their isoelectric points, type A: 7–9 and type B: 4–5 (Busch et al., 2003). Characteristic features of gelatin are the high content of the amino acids glycine, proline (mainly as hydroxyproline) and alanine which are responsible for its triple helical structure. However, formulations containing gelatin in the outer layer (hard and soft gelatin capsules) are susceptible to inter or intramolecular cross‐linking of gelatin with time, temperature and moisture and thus its use in pharmaceutical formulations is limited (Vandervoort and Ludwig, 2004). On the other hand gelatin is indispensible in modern pharmaceuticals because of its wide use in parenteral formulations and is being extensively explored owing to its natural origin, physical and chemical nature, non-toxicity and biodegradability. The presence of numerous functional groups in gelatin offers the advantage of incorporating more functionalities and ways to introduce modifications by means of chemical derivatization. Gelatin as a matrix for mineralization has attained a lot of importance in the field of tissue engineering (Kaul and Amiji, 2002). Chitosan conjugated gelatin (Chen et al., 2002a,b), poly(D,L-lactide)-grafted gelatin (Ma et al., 2002) and poly(ethylene glycol)-modified gelatin are some of the potential gelatin based derivatives for pharmaceutical applications (Kaul and Amiji, 2002). Recent research has shown the amphiphilic properties of gelatin by the association of phosphatidyl ethanolamine onto gelatin-co-PLA (Han et al., 2013a). Addition of cross‐linkers like glutaraldehyde, gives gelatin stability, shape and a raised circulation time in vivo as compared to unchanged particles. It has been observed that the degree of cross linking influenced the swelling and erosion of gelatin matrix in release medium leading to different release profile of the drugs (Bajpai and Choubey, 2006). This structural change improves the performance, properties and distinctiveness of gelatin like insolubility at elevated temperatures, reduced swelling in water and a smaller amount of permeability to cell membranes. Its supplementary advantages include inexpensiveness, sterilization, relatively low antigenicity and more often than not absence of pyrogens. The primary structure of gelatin provides several possibilities for chemical alteration and covalent drug attachment. This can be done either directly on the particle surface or within the matrix of the particles. In the former case, the particle surface is chemically modified while in the latter case the gelatin macromolecules are chemically modified before scaling down to NPs (Bajpai and Choubey, 2006). Recent research has shown that free thiol groups can form disulfide bonds within the polymer, thus strengthening the tertiary and quaternary protein structure. The disulfide bonds stabilize the NPs, and when they are busted, the polymer unfolds, releasing the encapsulated drug. This mechanism is highly environment responsive and is enhanced by the presence of glutathione or other similar redox enzymes occurring in high concentrations in the hypoxic regions such as the tumor cells (Kommareddy and Amiji, 2005). The use of gelatin has been extensively employed in ocular applications as the native protein collagen from which gelatin is derived, is present in the eye, more specifically in the stroma which is the middle cell layer of the cornea (Friess, 1998; Sintzel et al., 1996).

Several methods have been developed for the preparation of gelatin particles, such as emulsification and desolvation, which are the preferred ones and coacervation. In the emulsification method, an aqueous gelatin solution is emulsified in an oily phase and thereafter precipitated by cold or heat treatment, generally leading to the formation of microparticles. To obtain NPs, desolvation methods are more suitable. A desolvating agent (e.g. a salt solution, alcohol, acetone) is added to an aqueous gelatin solution causing dehydration of gelatin molecules, and thereby changing the conformation from stretched to coiled, which is indicated by a rise in turbidity. Subsequently, a crosslinking agent is added to harden the native particles. These properties make gelatin‐based NPs a potential carrier system for drug delivery (Marty et al., 1978; Tanaka et al., 1963)."

      "heading" : "2.4. Albumin",
      "text" : "Albumin based NPs have received significant attention due to their biological origin, biodegradability, lack of toxicity, easy accessibility, water solubility, non-immunogenicity and most importantly their ability to accumulate in the tumor sites (Elsadek and Kratz, 2012; Kratz, 2008). Albumins are of different types based on their sources. The one obtained from egg white is ovalbumin, from bovine serum is bovine serum albumin (BSA) and from human serum is human serum albumin (HSA). It is also available from soybeans, milk and grains. BSA and HSA have been widely used as carriers for nanodrug formulations. Serum albumin is the main protein in the circulatory system and is a heartshaped globular protein comprising of ∼585 amino acids, with molecular weight of about 66 kDa. As shown in Fig. 3a, structurally, albumin consists of three main domains, namely domain I, II and III and each includes two sub-domains (A and B). There are two main binding sites on albumin known as Sudlow sites I and II, respectively. Albumin improves the solubility of hydrophobic molecules in the blood and acts as a carrier for different substances. Thus, it could deliver various essentials to the precise tissues in the body and can influence the fate of a molecule in the blood. BSA and HSA are the major available albumins extensively used in the protein binding studies and targeted drug delivery applications (Jahanban-Esfahlan et al., 2015; Jahanban-Esfahlan and Panahi-Azar, 2016). Studies have shown that cell culture experiments confirm non-cytoxicity of HSA NPs (Watcharin et al., 2014). In addition, the large number of reactive functional groups on their surface such as thiol, amino and carboxylic group enables binding of many drugs and covalent modification for a targeted drug delivery (Anhorn et al., 2008). There are 59 lysines with N-terminal amine and primary amino groups occurring per HSA molecule which are the most important sites for covalent linking. Nonetheless, the particle surface has limited quantity of accessible amino groups which is much less compared to HSA molecules in solution. Studies have shown that a theoretical cross linking of 40% of these groups with glutaraldehyde gave better stability to the particles than with 100% cross linking (Weber et al., 2000).\nAlbumin modified with PEG has not only proved to have prolonged circulation in blood compared to albumin that has not been PEGylated but also opened doors for revolutionizing the next generation cancer pharmaceuticals (Elzoghby et al., 2012; Yin et al., 2016). A major issue found since the commencement of research on nano drug delivery is the rapid opsonization of the drug from the body before proper interaction with the target site. As soon as the NPs are administered to the system, thousands of plasma proteins surround these NPs and form a “protein corona” that masks their actual function, leading to a successful in vitro result but unsuccessful outcome in vivo. Coating these NPs with preformed albumin corona causes a camouflaging effect and has turned out to be a potential method to overcome opsonization and thereby improve circulation (Jiang et al., 2016).

A prototype of albumin NPs was prepared by introducing a ‘host-guest’ supramolecular association by fabricating β-cyclodextrin-modified glycol chitosan and adamantane conjugated HSA, which showed excellent ability to target tumor (Nan et al., 2017). The ability of albumin to mount on solid tumors makes it a prospective candidate for site-targeted delivery of antitumor drugs (Merodio et al., 2001).\nTaxol – a formulation of paclitaxel commonly administered for metatastic breast cancer was found to show toxic effects due to the presence of Cremophor EL, an emulsifier used during its preparation. To overcome this toxicity, albumin bound nanoparticles of paclitaxel (abraxane) were prepared that eliminated the toxicity associated with Cremophor EL, while retaining the therapeutic properties of the drug. Abraxane reported an approximate 70–80% higher maximally tolerated dose (MTD) compared to taxol (Sparreboom et al., 2005). Abraxane (260mg/m2) or Taxol (175mg/m2) administered to 454 patients with metatastic cancer intravenously every three weeks in a Phase III study showed a significantly greater response rate in patients treated with Abraxane than with Taxol (Gradishar et al., 2005). The occurrence of grade 4 neutropaenia was lower in abraxane in spite of containing higher dosage of paclitaxel (9% versus 22%; p=0.001). Pharmacokinetic assessments showed a higher clearance of paclitaxel at 13 L/h/m2 for abraxane while it was 14.76 L for taxol (p=0.048). Similarly, abraxane showed a higher volume of distribution with 663.8 L/m2 while 433.4 L/m2 for taxol (p=0.04) (Sparreboom et al., 2005). However, it is yet to be ascertained that the clinical benefit of abraxane is due to its functioning as a nanoparticle or due to the removal of the emulsifier, Cremophor EL (Henderson and Bhatia 2007; Davis et al.,\n2008). After the successful clinical trials of abraxane, several other albumin based nanoparticles (NABs) have entered the clinical trials to improve the therapeutic values of other drugs. These include NABdocetaxel (Zheng et al., 2014), NAB-rapamycin (Cristea et al., 2010) and NAB-thiocolchicine (Li et al., 2017; Bobo et al., 2016). Other nanoformulations of albumin that have reached preclinical trials include albumin bound nanoparticles of doxorubicin and methotrexate in the treatment of cancer (Wosikowski et al., 2003) and cationic albuminPEG nanoparticles NC-1900 vasopressin fragment analog for scopolamine induced memory deficits (Xie et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008). Table 3 lists the salient features of some selected methods for drug delivery.\nAlbumin NPs are being considered as good carrier materials for biologically active ingredients owing to their high binding capacity and non-toxicity. These NPs can be formulated by methods such as desolvation, emulsification, and spray drying. Among various preparation methods, emulsification and desolvation are generally more preferred (Seunghyun et al., 2016)."

      "text" : "Carrageenan is a naturally occurring anionic sulphated polysaccharide (Fig. 3b), first extracted in 1837 from red seaweed of Rhodophyceae family. The word “carrageenan” is derived from Irish name “carrageen” meaning “little rock”. It is extracted by drying and washing the seaweed with cold water. It is then broken up and agitated in hot alkaline solution to extract carrageenan and subsequently converted into powder form (Chen et al., 2002a,b). Carrageenan is characterized based on the species of seaweed used as a source. It is formed by\nalternate units of D-galactose and 3,6-anhydrogalactose that are joined by α-1,3 and β-1,4 glycosidic linkage. On the basis of type of bonding between galactose units and the position of attachment of sulphate groups to galactose unit, carrageenan is categorized into λ- (lambda-), κ- (kappa-), ι- (iota-), υ- (nu-), μ- (mu-), θ- (theta-) and ξ- (ksi-). On the basis of family they are mainly of three types, ι -, κ – and λ-carrageenan each having different solubility and charge density (Hoffmann et al., 1996). It is of interest for drug delivery because of its interesting characteristics such as gelling, thickening, emulsifying, and stabilizing properties. Carrageenan has also shown a variety of pharmaceutical properties such as anticancer, anticoagulant, antihyperlipidemic, and immunomodulatory activities (Campo et al., 2009; Wijesekara et al., 2011). In vitro studies have shown antiviral effects of carrageenan, capable of hindering the replication of hepatitis A virus. It possesses an important property of formation of water-retaining hydrogels which is useful in the development of wound coating materials (Girond et al., 1991). Some interesting features of carrageenan like adhesiveness and positive surface charge provide extra advantage in prolonging drug release in mucosal/epithelial tissues (Farnoosh et al., 2013). Carrageenan on combination with several other materials such as polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels, Au-nanofillers, and chitosan has been used for controlled drug release (Hezaveh and Muhamad, 2013; Pinheiro et al 2012; Salgueiro et al., 2013). Despite its tremendous potential, there is limited research on the use of carrageenan in drug-delivery (Table 3). Further investigation of this polymer will open up new platforms in drug delivery especially for wound dressing."

      "heading" : "2.6. Starch",
      "text" : "Starch is a biodegradable and edible polysaccharide which is nontoxic and found abundantly in nature. It is present in plants such as corn, potato, rice, tapioca, wheat, sorghum and barley. The type of starch varies depending on the source, such as cereal seeds (corn, wheat, etc.), tubers (potato) or roots (tapioca). Starch is white in color and insoluble in cold water because of the polymerized structure, and has hydrogen bonding between adjacent chains. It has two components: amylase, a straight chain sugar polymer and amylopectin, having a branched structure which forms a major part of starch (Fig. 3c). Starch, as extracted from plants is called “native starch” while the one that undergoes enzymatic or chemical modifications to attain certain properties is called “modified starch” (Han et al., 2013b; Prado et al., 2009). It has the ability to form inter- and intramolecular cross-linking with polyanions. The most popular polyanion used as an effective crosslinking agent is sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), which is non-toxic with no reported adverse effects on humans (El-Naggar et al., 2015).\nStarch has attracted applications in controlled release because of its advantages such as enhancing drug solubility and drug-stability, decreasing drug toxicity and side effects, excellent biocompatibility and storage capacity. However, native starch is less beneficial because of its many limitations and this demands chemical modification of starch including oxidation, cross-linking, hydroxypropylation, retrogradation etc. to improve its properties (Ding et al., 2016; Haaj et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2015; Moad, 2011; Soares et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014). Of late, resistant starch has also become an alternative approach for drug entrapment in colon-specific delivery. Resistant starch is a fraction of starch that escapes digestion in the upper gastro-intestinal tract and reaches the colon to put forth prebiotic effect. It selectively stimulates the growth and the activity of helpful bacterial groups such as bifidobacteria and lactobacillus. After fermentation it produces short chain fatty acids which change the intestinal pH and increase bioavailability of the divalent cations. Therefore, resistant starch could be a potential encapsulating material for colon-specific delivery (Gibson and Roberfroid, 1995).\nCurrently, nucleotide analogues appear as promising agents especially in the treatment against viral infectious diseases and cancer. However, due to their hydrophilic nature limited passive intracellular\ndiffusion is observed which leads to severe side effects and unstable nature in vivo. Polyamine grafted starch complexed with ATP (nucleotide analogue) to form polyplexes has been used for the treatment against A549 cancer cells (Kawashita et al., 2005). Hydroxyethylation is another modification that is rapidly substituting PEGylation. Hydroxyethyl starch acts as an amphiphilic polymer and works well to prolong the circulation of NPs in the body for drugs with short plasma half life (Erdem et al., 2016). Another research showed development of stimuli responsive starch NPs for theranostic applications (Jianbo et al., 2018). A summary of potential work done with starch is illustrated in\nTable 3. Several preparation approaches of starch particles have been investigated, such as solvent evaporation, precipitation, spray dying and emulsion-cross-linking techniques, among which water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion-cross-linking technique has been extensively used (Nahid et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016c). The extensive use of starch as a drug carrier is mainly because it is obtained from renewable sources, ease of chemical modifications, low cost and ability to replace some synthetic polymers (Lima-Tenório et al., 2015)."

      "heading" : "2.7. Guar gum",
      "text" : "Guar gum (GG) is a high-molecular weight, water-soluble, non-ionic biopolymer derived from the seeds of Cyamopsis tetragonolobus, family Leguminosae that has been widely used in the pharmaceutical products primarily due to its unique ability to alter rheological properties (Burke et al., 2000). As GG is a hydrocolloid polysaccharide, it is commonly used in the preparation of hydrogels for drug delivery systems (George et al., 2019; Gliko-Kabir et al., 2010; Kono et al., 2014; Mafi et al., 2014; Murali et al., 2014). It consists of linear chains of (1→ 4)-β-dmannopyranosyl units with α-d-galactopyranosyl units attached by (1→ 6) linkages (Fig. 3d). Among naturally occurring water-soluble polysaccharides, GG is known to have molecular weights (Mw), in the vicinity of∼2.8× 107 gmol−1 (Barth and Smith, 1981). Guar gum has gained much attention in oral drug delivery due to its propensity towards microbial degradation in the large intestine. Besides, the likely use of guar gum as a colon-specific, antihypertensive and transdermal drug delivery system has also been explored. However a major hindrance in its usage is due to its hydrophilic character which leads to extensive swelling and thereby causing a rapid release of loaded drugs. To obviate this innate shortcoming, guar gum is usually employed in combination with other polymers to form interpenetrating polymer networks (IPN) which provides tougher mechanical and thermal properties to the otherwise delicate hydrogel. Guar gum has also been developed in association with pH-sensitive polymers and explored for their efficiency in target specific drug delivery (Li et al., 2008a,b; Prabaharan, 2011).\nFew other limitations of GG includes, uncontrolled rates of hydration, thickening effect, high swelling, highly vulnerable to microbial attack and the intricacy in controlling its viscosity due to relative fast biodegradation. Various approaches have been developed in order to overcome these issues, offering plenty of opportunities to tailor the physical and chemical properties of guar gum, through derivatization reactions such as methylation (Risica et al., 2005), sulfation (Wang et al., 2013b), hydroxyalkylation (He et al., 2008; Kono et al., 2015), and carboxymethylation (Gong et al., 2012; Yadav et al., 2011). The extent of solubility of GG can be controlled by the addition of crosslinking agents such as glutaraldehyde, tri-sodium tri-metaphosphate and sodium borate solution to improve thermal and mechanical properties for biomedical applications (Burruano et al., 2002; Young et al., 2005). Different types of chemically modified pH-sensitive GG derivatives have been prepared as carriers for controlled drug delivery which includes GG-graft-acrylic acid–nanosilica membranes for transdermal diclofenac delivery, cross-linked hydrogels based on GG-graft-poly(acrylamide) and GG-alginate as pH-sensitive drug delivery systems (George and Abraham, 2007; Shahid et al., 2013). Fluorescent labeled guar gum NPs are considered as excellent tools for bioimaging and can\nalso be explored as molecular sensors for drug delivery applications (Ghosh et al., 2015). Clay minerals are all-pervasive to earth’s surface and clay biopolymers are an expanding class of materials in the application of drug delivery. GG-montmorillonite has emerged out as an interesting candidate for drug delivery (Prasad et al., 2009). GG has proved to be a fine capping agent for mesoporous silica NPs for colon specific drug delivery (Dziadkowiec et al., 2017), along with novel GG oleate-graft-poly(methacrylic acid) hydrogels (Balmiki et al., 2017). As an eco-friendly, renewable and economical material, at present GG is argued to replace starch in many applications (George et al., 2019; Seeli and Prabaharan, 2017)."

Pectin is another natural, non-hazardous and amorphous polysaccharide present in cell walls of plant tissues with potential for use in pharmaceutical formulations. It possesses has high molecular weight heteropolymers containing at least 65% (by weight) of D- galacturonic acid units which are joined with one another by means of (1→ 4) glycosidic linkages. Pectin macromolecules are capable of binding with some organic and inorganic substances through molecular interactions.

In another work cyclodextrin-drug complex was made to associate with solid lipid NPs thereby giving rise to an effective oral liquid formulation especially for pediatrics with good therapeutic effects and sustained release (Gil et al., 2012). Further, a star shaped polymer of β-cyclodextrin-graft-vitamin E d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) used for doxorubicin delivery showed promising results for multidrug resistance (MDR) inhibition (Cirri et al., 2017). Cyclodextrin based nanoparticles have found to be effective drug carriers in clinical trials. Cyclocert – a nanoformulation consisting of cyclodextrin and camtothecin commonly given for solid tumors, rectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer was found to be very effective in the Phase I/II trials (Giglio et al., 2015).

Specific characteristics of RBCs such as their configuration and surface proteins have been taken as indication to formulate the next-generation delivery platforms. Even though considerable efforts have been dedicated in bridging the gap between synthetic nanomaterials and biological entities, an RBC-mimicking delivery vehicle is still a challenge for biomedical researchers mainly because of the difficulty in functionalizing NPs with the intricate surface chemistry of a biological cell (Yang et al., 2018)."

The physicochemical properties of the drug molecules, their size and loading requirements play a major role in the fabrication methods of these NPs (Kamaly et al., 2012). On the whole a number of parameters need to be considered for the preparation of polymeric NPs which comprises of choice of solvent, drug solubility, the mixing time of the aqueous and the organic solvents, the type of surfactant used apart from other factors (Chan et al., 2010; Grabnar and Kristl, 2011; MoraHuertas et al., 2010). Fig. 4 outlines different methods expediently developed for the preparation of NPs for nanoformulations. These are broadly classified into two main categories, based on method of preparation namely, a) from preformed polymers via solvent evaporation, nanoprecipitation, salting out, ionotropic gelation and supercritical fluid technology, and b) through polymerization of monomers using mini and micro emulsion, interfacial polymerization and controlled/ living radical polymerization.

      "text" : "Solvent evaporation was among the first methods developed to prepare polymeric NPs by dispersion of preformed polymers. It is now widely used in different pharmaceutical applications especially with biodegradable polymers (Gurny et al., 1981). This method implies preparation of polymer solutions in volatile solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate. The drug is then dissolved or dispersed in the solution and the organic phase is emulsified under agitation in a dispersing phase consisting of an immiscible nonsolvent (water) of the polymer, which contains a suitable emulsifying agent. The emulsion thus formed is then converted into a nanoparticle suspension on evaporation of the solvent either by reducing the pressure or by continuous stirring (Fig. 5a).\nThe conventional methods apply two main strategies for the formation of emulsions, i) preparation of single-emulsions, e.g., oil-inwater (o/w) and ii) double-emulsions, e.g., (water-in-oil)-in-water, (w/ o/w). Generally the aqueous phase contains the stabilizer whereas the polymer dissolved in an organic solvent forms the oil phase. Both these strategies utilize high-speed homogenization or ultrasonication, followed by evaporation of the solvent, either by reduced pressure or continuous magnetic stirring at room temperature. The solidified NPs obtained are collected by ultracentrifugation and washed with distilled water to remove the presence of additives if any and later subjected to lyophillization (Allemann et al., 1993; Anton et al., 2008).\nOil/water emulsion are of interest from an economic perspective as\nwater is used as nonsolvent thereby simplifying the whole process by eliminating the need for recycling, facilitating the washing step and minimizing agglomeration (Aftabrouchard and Dorlker, 1992). It was found that the nature and concentration of the stabilizer, homogenization speed and polymer concentration had a major influence on the particles size (Zohri, 2009). Temperature and the viscosity of the organic and aqueous phases also controlled the size of the NPs (Tice and Gilley, 1985). Conversely, the scale-up of this process would require high energy in homogenization and can be applied to only liposoluble drugs (Soppimath et al., 2001)."

      "heading" : "3.1.2. Nanoprecipitation/solvent displacement method",
      "text" : "The nanoprecipitation method also known as the solvent displacement method is based on the principle of the interfacial deposition of a polymer after displacement of a semipolar solvent, miscible with water, from a lipophilic solution as portrayed in Fig. 5b (Fessi et al., 1989). Interfacial deposition is not a polymerization process but an emulsification/solidification technique (Reis et al., 2006). The interfacial tension between the two phases is reduced due to rapid diffusion of the solvent into the nonsolvent phase leading to formation of small droplets of organic solvent and an increase in the surface area. The scheme for nanoprecipitation consists of three basic components, the polymer, the polymer solvent and the non-solvent of the polymer. Organic solvents such as ethanol and acetone which are miscible with water and easily removed by evaporation are generally chosen as polymer solvent (Mishra et al., 2010). Conversely, the non-solvent phase mostly consists of water to which one or more naturally occurring or synthetic\nsurfactants are added. The NPs can be obtained by either slow addition of the organic phase to the aqueous phase under moderate stirring or by adding the aqueous phase to the organic phase in small increments. A narrow distribution formed instantly through the rapid diffusion of the polymer solution in the non-solvent phase characterizes the formation of NPs with a well defined size-range. The main parameters that determine the success of the method include addition of the organic phase to the aqueous phase, the organic phase injection rate, aqueous phase agitation rate, method of addition, organic to aqueous phase ratio, the nature and concentration of their components. The addition of surfactants maintains the nanoparticle suspensions from getting agglomerated during long storage periods and their presence influence the particle size depending on their nature and concentration (Ferranti et al., 1997; Limayem et al., 2006).\nThe formation of NPs during nanoprecipitation consists of three stages, nucleation, growth and aggregation (Moinard-Chécot et al., 2008). The rate at which each step proceeds determines the particle size and the thrust of these phenomena is the ratio of polymer concentration over the solubility of the polymer in the solvent mixture. The key aspect to obtain uniform particle size distribution is the separation between the nucleation and the growth stages. Ideal conditions should allow a high nucleation rate which is strongly dependent on supersaturation and lower growth rate. Nanoprecipitation is an easy, speedy and reproducible method widely used in the formulation of nanospheres and nanocapsules. Nevertheless, challenges pertaining to low polymer concentration in the organic phase have to be addressed for better results (Lince et al., 2008)."

      "heading" : "3.1.3. Salting out method",
      "text" : "To reduce the use of hazardous organic solvents, surfactants and other chlorinated solvents, a modified version of emulsion process that involves a salting-out process was introduced (Fig. 5c). The polymer containing solvent which is normally miscible with water such as acetone, is emulsified in the aqueous phase without the assistance of any high-shear forces, by dissolving high concentration of sucrose or salt for a strong salting-out effect in the aqueous phase (Ganachaud and Katz, 2005). The miscibility properties of water with other solvents are modified according to the solubility of the electrolyte used such as magnesium chloride, calcium chloride and magnesium acetate. On performing a reverse process, i.e. on dilution, migration of the solvent towards the polymer from the emulsion droplets is induced. This is caused by the reduction of the salt or sucrose concentration in the continuous phase of the emulsion leading to precipitation of the polymer dissolved (Fan et al., 2006; Galindo-Rodriguez et al., 2004; Galindo-Rodriguez et al., 2005; Konan et al., 2002; Su et al., 2002; Zweers et al., 2004; Zweers et al., 2006). An added advantage to this method is that it minimizes stress to protein encapsulants (Jung et al., 2000). Also, it can be used while dealing with heat sensitive substances as it does not require high temperature (Lambert et al., 2001). However it can be applied exclusively to lipophilic drugs and the NPs formed demand extensive washing steps (Couvreur et al., 1995)."

Though this process is simple in practice, but is more complex to optimize (Hamidi et al., 2008). A typical method for preparation of chitosan NPs involves addition of an alkaline tripolyphosphate (TPP) solution (pH=7–9) into an acidic chitosan solution (pH=4–6). On mixing the two phases NPs are formed at once through inter- and intramolecular linkages between TPP phosphates and the amino groups of chitosan. NPs with varying characteristics can be obtained by changing the concentrations of chitosan and TPP (Janes et al., 2001). As for alginate, any cationic species such as divalent metal ions like calcium chloride can initiate the reaction sequence. Similar to chitosan, optimization of alginate is a multifactor process; concentration/viscosity,\ncounter ion concentration, and the speed of adding the counter ion solution into the alginate solution all contribute towards achieving the desired size range. Various factors affect the nano particle sizes which include the chitosan-TPP ratios, volumetric ratios, pH of the solutions, mixing procedure, degree of deacetylation and solution temperature. All these parameters are inter-related and this makes it difficult to identify the exact effect of each parameter (Kaloti and Bohidar, 2010).\nNPs are formed when chitosan and TPP concentrations are very precise- a phenomenon that is explained by putting theoretical concepts to practice. In acidic environment (the solvent used to dissolve chitosan) electrostatic repulsion occurs between the chitosan molecules owing to the presence of protonated amino groups. Simultaneously, inter-chain hydrogen bonding interactions also exists between the chitosan molecules. Thus, two opposite forces act on the chitosan moiety at the same time. At a certain concentration the hydrogen bonding attraction and the electrostatic repulsion are in equilibrium. Consequently, within this concentration range, as chitosan concentration increases, molecules come closer to each other (despite constrained by electrostatic repulsion), directing to a controlled increase in intermolecular cross-linking and ultimately leading to particles in the nano range. Above this concentration, hydrogen bonding has a strong influence causing a large amount of chitosan molecules to be involved in the cross-linking of a single particle; thereby forming microparticles. With an increase in TPP volume, there is an initial decrease in the particle size where excess addition again leads to formation of aggregates. Considering the pH of the solutions, most favorable amino-phosphate cross-linking was found to occur at pH between 4.5 and 5.2 (Fan et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2008)."

      "text" : "Since most of the methods for preparation of PNPs involve use of organic solvents, there is always the need to develop procedures with greener approach. This factor encouraged research on the effectiveness of supercritical fluids as more environmental friendly solvents, with the potential to produce PNPs with a good level of purity. Dense gas technology and supercritical fluid technology are predicted to offer an appealing and efficient approach (Fig. 6a), avoiding most of the limitations of the conventional methods to prepare NPs (Kawashima, 2001; York, 1999). A supercritical fluid is in general defined as a solvent at a temperature above its critical temperature, during which the fluid remains a single phase in spite of the pressure. Supercritical CO2 is the most widely used supercritical fluid attributable to its gentle critical conditions (Tc=31.1 °C, Pc=73.8 bars), undamaging and nonflammable nature. There are two common procedures involving supercritical fluids namely, supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) and rapid expansion of critical solution (RESS). The process of SAS employs a liquid solvent such as methanol, which is completely miscible with the CO2 supercritical fluid to dissolve the solute at the process conditions. RESS differs from SAS process where the solute is dissolved in a supercritical fluid (such as supercritical methanol) and then the solution is rapidly expanded through a small nozzle into a region of lower pressure. This technique yields solvent free NPs. While supercritical fluid technology is environmentally friendly and suitable for mass production, its initial expenditure is quite high as it requires specially designed equipment (Mohanraj and Chen, 2006)."

The continuous organic phase process adepts the dispersion of monomer into an emulsion or inverse microemulsion, or any nonsolvent as represented in Fig. 6b. Alternatively, the monomer can be converted to an initiating radical by applying high energy, the chain propagates when this radical\nmonomer collides with another monomer and before or after termination occurs, phase separation and formation of solid particles can take place. Initially, surfactants and other protective soluble polymers were used to prevent clogging of the particles in the early stages of polymerization. However this procedure is not given much importance today because of the use of toxic chemicals during various stages. In the aqueous continuous phase, surfactants and emulsifiers are not required and the monomer is dissolved in a continuous phase that is usually an aqueous solution. The initiation of polymerization reaction can take place by different mechanisms, but once initiated the chain growth starts rapidly (Kreuter, 1982; Reis et al., 2006, Vauthier et al., 2003)."

A typical formulation for this process consists of initiator, water, monomer mixture, surfactant and co-stabilizer. The primary difference between emulsion polymerization and mini-emulsion polymerization is the use of a high-shear device such as ultrasound and a low molecular mass compound as the co-stabilizer. Mini-emulsions have an interfacial tension much greater than zero and are critically stabilized, requiring a high-shear to reach a steady state (Bardajee et al., 2007; Baruch-Sharon and Margel, 2010; Crespy and Landfester, 2009; Rotureau et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2009a; Yildiz and Landfester, 2008). This method is best suited for the preparation of core-shell polymer NPs, consisting of a magnetic core, magnetite, and a biodegradable polymeric shell. The initiator and the co-stabilizers have a key influence on the formation\nand nature of the PNPs (Arias et al., 2001)."

      "text" : "A new and effective approach for preparing nanosized polymer particles and has attracted significant attention as it produces colloidal polymer particles of high molar mass which makes them entirely different when compared kinetically. The average number of chains per particle and the size of the particles formed are quite small in microemulsion. Also, it exhibits only two reaction rate intervals whereas the simple emulsion shows three reaction rate intervals (Puig, 1996). In this technique, typically water soluble initiator is added to the aqueous phase of a thermodynamically stable micro-emulsion containing swollen micelles. The polymerization reaction starts from the spontaneously formed states which is thermodynamically stable and relies on high quantities surfactant systems which possess an interfacial tension at the oil/water interface close to zero.\nAfter sometime, the particles become completely covered with surfactant as a result of a high amount of surfactant. Since the initiation cannot be attained simultaneously in all micro droplets, initially the polymer chains are observed in only some droplets. With time, the osmotic and elastic control of the chains destabilize the delicate microemulsions leading to an increase in particle size, formation of empty micelles and later secondary nucleation. Minuscule latexes as small as 5 nm–50 nm in size, coexist with a mainstream of empty micelles in the final product (Antonietti and Landfester, 2002). Some of the vital factors affecting the micro-emulsion polymerization kinetics and the properties of PNPs include the type of initiator and its concentration,\nsurfactant, monomer and reaction temperature. Regardless of the many prospective applications of polymer latexes obtained by micro-emulsion polymerization, the marketable use of this process has been partial because a typical polymer formulation is dilute and requires a bulky ratio of surfactant to monomer and the surfactant concentration by and large exceeds the quantity required for polymer stability (Prasad Rao and Geckeler, 2011)."

      "text" : "The interfacial polymerization method is a widely established method for the development of PNPs (Gaudin and Zydowicz, 2008; Landfester et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2009b). It is based on the step polymerization of two reactive monomers which are dissolved in continuous and dispersed phases, respectively while the reaction takes place at the interface of the two liquids (Karode et al., 1998;). By employing interfacial cross-linking reactions such as polyaddition, polycondensation (Crespy et al., 2007; Danicher et al., 2000; Torini et al., 2005) and radical polymerization (Sarkar et al., 2005; Scott et al., 2005;), nanometer sized hollow particles were developed. By the polymerization of monomers at the oil/water interface of a very fine oil-in-water micro emulsion, oil containing nanocapsules are obtained (Khoury-Fallouh et al., 1986). Presence of protic solvents, such as ethanol, n-butanol, and isopropanol, were found to stimulate the formation of nanospheres in addition to nanocapsules. Hence to promote nanocapsule formation, the use of aprotic solvents, such as acetone and acetonitrile is suggested (Puglisi et al., 1995). Likewise, if interfacial polymerization of monomers in water-in-oil micro-emulsions is carried out then water-containing nanocapsules can be obtained. The polymer formed at the water-oil interface is precipitated to produce nanocapsule shell."

      "text" : "A relatively different type of polymerization process called the living radical polymerization has opened new trends in place of the old polymerization techniques. The increasing concern for environment and the need for innovations in the applications of hydrophilic polymers are the primary contributors for the development of this trend. Aqueous dispersed systems usually adopt living radical polymerization method. Execution of C/LRP to industrial scale is important as it provides precise particle size and size distribution, which is crucial for commercialization (Matyjaszewski and Xia, 2001; Zetterlund et al., 2007; Zetterlund et al., 2008). Among the various methods available for C/LRP (Braunecker and Matyjaszewski, 2007; Cunningham, 2008), three approaches namely nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) (Dire et al., 2009; Farcet et al., 2002; Nicolas et al., 2007), atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) (Li et al., 2009; Min et al., 2006; Min et al., 2009; Min and Matyjaszewski, 2005; Oh et al., 2009; Siegwart et al., 2009) and reversible addition and fragmentation transfer chain polymerization (RAFT) (Manguian et al., 2006; Rieger et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2007) have been studied at length. Apart from temperature, parameters such as the nature and concentration of the control agent, monomer, initiator and emulsion type are central in determining the size of PNPs. Among these, the nature of the control agent is crucial in determining the particle size of the final product.\nA range of opportunities for the preparation of PNPs with potential applications in functional materials has been created by C/LRP. There has been an increasing interest during recent years to understand the heterogeneous C/LRP in NMP, ATRP, and RAFT even though a number of challenges still need to be overcome to understand completely the fundamental aspects of the chemistry behind this technique. Some of these issues are unique to each system while some others are common to all of them. General problems include presence of a residual control agent in the product, added process intricacy and cost in comparison to the conventional radical polymerizations. Further, the presence of residual control agents gives rise to concerns regarding color, odor, stability, and environmental lawmaking. Elimination of the interfering\nagents from aqueous dispersions is expected to be more complex than from homogeneous solutions. These challenges need to be overcome for the successful commercialization of this technique (Prasad Rao and Geckeler, 2011)."

      "heading" : "4. Characterization of polymeric nanoparticles",
      "text" : "For the characterization of NPs their size, surface charge and morphology are studied with the help of sophisticated microscopic techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The charge of the particle, their average particle size and size distribution affects the overall physicochemical stability of these NPs. The electron microscopy techniques are helpful in determining surface morphology and the overall shape of the PNPs. The surface charge plays a major role in interaction with the cell membranes inside the body (Pal et al., 2011).\nThe most popular method for nano particle size determination is dynamic light scattering (DLS). When light hits small particles, it scatters in all directions and the scattering intensity fluctuates over time. This is because the particles are constantly undergoing Brownian motion; hence the distance between them changes with time. This light further undergoes either constructive or destructive interference by the presence of surrounding particles, and gives information about the time scale of movement of the scatterers within this intensity fluctuation. This technique enables knowledge of size distribution and gives details about the particle’s movement in the medium, measuring the diffusion coefficient of the particle. This is the first step for the accurate determination of the particle size and size-distribution.\nTo obtain further information on the size and shape of the particle, SEM and TEM instruments are used; more than often these instruments generate similar type of data. SEM is a type of electron microscopy that produces images of a sample by scanning it with a focused beam of electrons. These electrons interact with the atoms of the sample thereby producing various signals. TEM on the other hand uses high energy electrons which are accelerated at a very high speed; nearly at the speed of light. It works on the same basic principle of light microscope but uses electrons instead of light. SEM is based on scattered electrons and gives information on surface morphology and composition of the particle while TEM is based on transmitted electrons and one can obtain information on the internal composition such as crystallization and magnetic domains along with morphology of the particle.\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) is another very useful technique for conducting samples and biological samples that provides ultra-high resolution in particles of nano range based on a physical scanning of samples at sub-micron level using a probe tip of atomic scale. This instrument gives a topographical map of sample based on the forces acting between the tip and the sample surface. Depending on their properties samples are generally scanned in contact or noncontact mode. The topographical map is generated by tapping the probe on to the surface across the sample in contact mode while in the non-contact mode the probe hovers over the conducting surface. The major advantage of AFM is its ability to image non-conducting samples without any specific treatment, thus ensuring safe imaging of delicate biological and polymeric nanostructures. AFM is one instrument that provides the most precise report of size and size distribution without any mathematical treatment (Bhokare et al., 2015).\nThe study the drug-polymer interaction forms an important part of the characterization process. This can be achieved with the help of Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) thanks to the advancements in software technology. An FT-IR of the pure drug, the polymer and the drug loaded polymer is recorded to study the interactions between the drug and the polymer. This interaction can also be studied by using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC)."

      "heading" : "5. Drug loading and drug release",
      "text" : "A successful nanoformulation should reduce the quantity of matrix materials while having a high drug-loading capacity. Drug loading can be done either by absorbing the drug after formation of particle or by incorporating it during the time of preparation. Drug loading and entrapment efficiency greatly depend on the solid-state drug solubility in matrix material or polymer which is again related to the composition of the polymer, the molecular weight, the drug polymer interaction and the presence of functional groups present on the polymer. For eg, protein shows highest loading efficiency when it is loaded at or near its isoelectric point having maximum adsorption and minimum solubility.\nFor the successful development of a nanoparticulate system biodegradation of the polymer and the drug release are two vital factors. The rate of drug release depends on the solubility of drug, diffusion through matrix, desorption of adsorbed drug, matrix erosion and combination of diffusion processes. If the drug is uniformly distributed in the nanospheres, the matrix undergoes erosion or diffusion to release the drug. If the drug diffuses out faster than the matrix, then the term ‘burst release’ is used; and is normally attributed to the weakly bound drugs on the surface of the PNPs. On the other hand if the drug is loaded by incorporation method, the system shows a sustained and a controlled release pattern. If the nanoparticle is coated by a polymer, then the coating membrane of the polymer acts as a barrier for the drug release and hence, the diffusivity and the solubility of the drug becomes the deciding factor for drug release. In case any supplementary element is added, the interaction between the drug and this supporting matter also influences the drug release rate. Different methods are employed to study the in vitro release of the drug, of which the dialysis bag diffusion technique is the most preferred one which is carried out using a dissolution apparatus (Vauthier et al., 2003)."

      "heading" : "6. Estimation of free drug and encapsulated drug",
      "text" : "The amount of free drug in a nanoformulation can be estimated by taking the sample in a dialysis bag such as cellophane membrane, tied and placed in a beaker containing 100mL water at 37 °C maintained at a pH of 10 on the magnetic stirrer. At predetermined intervals, a small quantity of sample is withdrawn using a syringe and replaced by same quantity of fresh water while maintaining the pH and the temperature. The withdrawn sample is then analyzed by measuring the absorbance of the drug using a UV–visible spectrophotometer. This process is continued till a constant absorbance is obtained. The estimation of the encapsulated drug is carried out by taking the residue that remains in the dialysis bag after the estimation of the free drug. The residue is then dissolved in a suitable solvent (to dissolve the polymer) and filtered. The remaining residue is further dissolved in 100mL water (or a suitable solvent to dissolve the drug), and the supernatant is analyzed for the drug content (Bhokare et al., 2015). The percentage of the free drug and the drug entrapped can be calculated using the following equations:\n=\n×\nof free drug Amount of free drug in mg of formulation\nTotal amount of drug present in mg of formulation\n% 100\n100\n100\n=\n×\ndrug entrapment Amount of encapsulated drug in mg of formulation\nTotal amount of drug present in mg of formulation % 100 100\n100\nTo achieve greater therapeutic effect, it is essential that the polymer should have higher drug loading efficiency for sustained release of the drug. Higher drug loading and encapsulation efficiency can be achieved by use of appropriate particle size and adequate optimization of the fabrication parameters. Extensive optimization of the conditions to\nprepare 5-fluorouracil-loaded PLGA NPs with Eudragit S100 using oilin-oil solvent evaporation technique led to the development of a nanoformulation with an enhanced drug loading efficiency and a sustained release of 120 h at a pH of 7.4 (Wang et al., 2013c)."

Polymeric nanoparticle based drug delivery systems have demonstrated several advantages over conventional macro drug delivery systems. In this regard, natural biodegradable polymer based nanoparticle drug delivery systems have proved to be a promising, viable, and a safe option for controlled release of drugs. These nanoformulations are superior to macroformulations or traditional formulations in the context of controlled release, targeted delivery and therapeutic effect. Additionally, they can help in reducing dosing frequency, while safeguarding stability and preserving the structure. This has become possible due to several reasons such as their ability to target specific organs and tissues, increase bioavailability, solubility and permeability of potent drugs, can act as DNA carriers in gene therapy and deliver large molecules such as proteins, peptides and genes through oral administration. With the availability of wide variety of natural biodegradable polymers there is tremendous scope for the development of safe and efficient drug delivery systems. However, pertinent issues in the search, design and development have to be carefully addressed. This includes adequate drug incorporation in the formulation with efficient release, sufficient biodistribution, biocompatibility, specificity in targeting, stability of the formulation and shelf life. Still a lot of ground has to be covered to enhance and realize the full potential of nanomedicines. This article presents the current understanding and scope of natural biodegradable polymer based nanoformulations for drug delivery. Further, different methods for preparation and characterization are discussed in detail along with significant features of selected formulations for drug delivery.\nFunding\nNone to declare.\nConflict of interest\nNone to declare.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nArchana George: Writing - original draft, Data curation.

The efficacy of many drugs in their micro/macro formulations is shown to have poor bioavailability and pharmacokinetics after oral administration. To overcome this predicament, use of natural/synthetic biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have gained prominence in the field of nanomedicine for targeted drug delivery to improve biocompatibility, bioavailability, safety, enhanced permeability, better retention time and lower toxicity. For drug delivery, it is essential to have biodegradable nanoparticle formulations for safe and efficient transport and release of drug at the intended site. Moreover, depending on the target organ, a suitable biodegradable polymer can be selected as the drug-carrier for target specific as well as for sustained drug delivery. The aim of this review is to present the current status and scope of natural biodegradable polymers as well as some emerging polymers with special characteristics as suitable carriers for drug delivery applications. The most widely preferred preparation methods are discussed along with their characterization using different analytical techniques. Further, the review highlights significant features of methods developed using natural polymers for drug entrapment and release studies.",
