A remarkable Cr(VI) removal efficiency (up to about 65%) was observed in large-lab-scale configuration, thus allowing to treat notable amounts of effluents volumes (30–70 L, basing on the inlet flow-rate) at fixed bed height of 38 cm and a sorbent mass of 850 g and 790 g of uncoated and coated material, respectively. The data obtained from lab-scale experiments at fixed bed height and three different inlet flow-rates were used in a non-linear regression procedure in the gPROMS environment to estimate sorption and kinetic parameters of three developed dynamic models. The regressed parameter values, film mass transfer coefficient kf, sorption kinetic constant Ka and reaction kinetic constant k, were then used as input values for the developed model to model the experimental data obtained at large-labscale. The modelling results demonstrated the suitability of the film-diffusion based model to well fit the labscale data and to model the large-lab-scale breakthrough curves of Cr(VI) removal using both uncoated and coated biomass. For this reason, and also considering the laminar flow conditions, this mass transfer mechanism was considered the limiting step of the Cr(VI) removal process."

      "text" : "In the last two decades several researchers have contributed to the field of wastewater treatment technology [1–4], developing integrated processes for the removal of both organic and inorganic pollutants [5,6]. Heavy metals in wastewaters still represent a severe issue to be faced in the selection of the appropriate technology for industrial and urban effluents in wastewater treatment plants [7]. Their high toxicity towards microorganisms may cause the total inhibition of bacteria activity [8] in biological reactors, or even the death of microorganisms. Among the most hazardous heavy metals, Chromium (Cr) in its hexavalent form is one of the most present in the industrial effluents of\nSouth European Countries, mainly due to industrial activities typical of this area, such as leather tanning, textile, painting, metallurgical and pesticides industries [9–11]. Hexavalent Chromium, Cr(VI) is a very toxic compound due to its high solubility, mobility, and oxidation potential as well as its bio-availability [12–14]. On the contrary, the trivalent form Cr(III) is considered less toxic, being characterized by a negligible solubility in a wide pH range (5–14) and a subsequent low mobility [9,15,16]. Therefore, the most effective and employed technology for Cr(VI) removal from wastewater is a two-step process, including a first reduction of Cr(VI) species (in the pH range 2–12 it is present as oxy-anions [17]) to low-soluble Cr(III) ones and the following sorption and precipitation of both Cr(VI) un-reduced species and\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2018.12.166 Received 19 November 2018; Received in revised form 27 December 2018; Accepted 28 December 2018\n⁎ Corresponding author.

Several researchers have already investigated the use of iron-based nanoparticles as reducing agent/sorbent material, because of a wide range of possibilities of tuning the surface-characteristics of these nanomaterials in function of the wastewater chemistry and physical characteristics [22–26]. The major issues to face when these nano-materials are to be employed in real treatment plants are: their low air-stability (the iron nanoparticles tend to be rapidly oxidized in a non-inert atmosphere), the related cost for their transportation and maintenance in inert atmosphere, the precursors cost (usually the reducing agent for the production of nano zero-valent iron particles, nZVI, is NaBH4) and the difficult total recovery of the used nano-particles from the treated streams, that can be successfully but partially recovered by magnetic devices, while a subsequent ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis step is necessary for a total removal [27,28]. To allow the nano-iron-based treatment technology in a sustainable way, various researchers successfully developed composite materials, characterized by a functionalized surface made by a nano-coating of iron-based nanoparticles (mainly nano-oxides) [29–31]. Only recently, the Authors produced a mixed-iron coated sorbent material, made of a core of olive stone biomass and a double-layer coating, made of nZVI and nano-magnetite, developing an air-stable material, simple to be synthetized and transported [32].\nIn this study the un-coated and coated olive stones were employed as packing material in lab-scale and large-lab-scale fixed-bed columns for the removal of Cr(VI) content from synthetic wastewater. The experimental data, obtained varying the inlet flow-rate at fixed Cr(VI) initial concentration and bed height, were modeled by a kinetic/diffusional parameters optimization procedure applied to a dynamic mathematical model, thus investigating the different transport mechanism of Cr(VI) species in the column."

K2Cr2O7 was used as target pollutant in DW water. The olive stones (OS) were obtained from an oil olive extraction plant located in the South of Spain. The nano-zerovalent iron particles (nZVI) and nano-magnetite particles (nMG) were synthesized according to the procedure reported in previous studies by the Authors, where their characterization is also thoroughly reported [32]. In brief, nZVI were produced by the borohydride reduction method, using a solution of FeSO4·7H2O as Fe(II) precursor and NaBH4 as reducing agent, in a BH4−:Fe(II) molar ratio equal to 2:1. Regarding nMG, FeCl3·6H2O and FeSO4·7H2O as Fe(II) and Fe(III) precursors (1:2 M ratio) and NH4OH to increase the solution pH up to 10 were used.\nThe mixed-iron coated olive stones (MICOS) were prepared according to a previous procedure [32]. The OS were coated with a double layer of nanoparticles. First, 2.5 g OS, 1.83 g FeSO4·7H2O and 100mL DW were added in a beaker (250mL). The mixture was stirred and heated to 65 °C, and then cooled maintaining the mechanical stirring (500 rpm) until 40 °C. Then, 0.5 M NaBH4 solution was added dropwise until reaching a BH4−/Fe(II) molar ratio equal to 2. The mixtures were stirred for 1 h and then rested overnight under inert atmosphere (N2). Subsequently, the coated particles were separated by a centrifuge (10000 rpm, 10min) and the same coating procedure was followed, involving the addition of 3.33 g FeCl3·6H2O and substituting the NaBH4 solution with a 5M NH4OH solution, added drop-wise until the pH 11 was reached.\nThe obtained MICOS material was then tested as packing material in large-lab-scale columns. A complete characterization of such material is reported in a previous study [32].\nThe Cr(VI) concentration was measured by the diphenylcarbazide standard method at 540 nm (EPA 7196A)."

The large-lab-scale column was provided with a mobile upper retaining grid, which could be fixed in the column to adjust it as a fixedbed or a semi-fluidized bed. The columns were equipped with a peristaltic pump (Ecoline VC-380) and a temperature-controlled thermostatic bath (Precisterm JP Selecta), to fix the temperature at 25 °C. The lab-scale column was packed with 12.44 g of OS and 11.63 g of MICOS (m) to achieve a bed height (h) of 10 cm, that corresponded to a bed volume (Vb) of 17.7 mL (considering the column section area of 1.77 cm2). The bed porosity (ε) was calculated as the ratio among void volume (Vv), measured by the volume of the added deionized water in the packed column filled with wet adsorbent particles at the 10 cm of h, and the related Vb. The bulk density ρb (g L−1) was calculated as the ratio among m and Vb.\nThe column scale-up to large-lab-scale was performed according to the criteria of geometric, kinematic and dynamic similarity [33]. According to the such criteria, both the ratio among the column height (l for lab-scale column and L for large-lab-scale one) and column diameter (d for lab-scale column and D for large-lab-scale one) and among the bed height (h is the lab-scale bed height and H is the large-lab-scale bed height) and column diameter was kept constant to about 16.67 and 6.67, respectively. According to the remaining criteria, the physical properties of the fluid and the linear velocity v (cmmin−1) were kept constant in both columns to ensure the same mass transfer and hydrodynamic conditions. The lab-scale column was filled with an OS/ MICOS amount necessary to reach an H/D ratio analogous to the h/d ratio of lab-scale column (h/d=6.67), i.e. an H value equal to about 38 cm. Table 1 summarizes the columns design and operative parameters selected for the experiments (the area of the column section is represented by A (cm2)).\nA supporting layer of 1.2 cm of glass wool was placed on the packed bed top, to prevent sorbent floating. A first set of experiments on labscale were conducted at selected volumetric flow-rate Q (2, 4 and 6mLmin−1), with a linear velocity equal to 1.13, 2.26 and 3.39 cmmin−1, respectively. According to these v values the following volumetric flow-rates were calculated for the large-lab-scale set of experiments: 28, 56 and 78mLmin−1, respectively. The initial Cr(VI) concentration was fixed to 20mg L−1. The sampling time was fixed to 15min and the experiments, in an up-flow set-up, were stopped until the final Cr(VI) concentration reached the initial Cr(VI) concentration. Fig. 1 displays the two experimental set-ups."

The tb occurs when the target-pollutant concentration reaches a determined value (in this study the limit of 0.2 mg L−1, i.e. 1% with respect to the initial Cr(VI) concentration, was considered). The breakthrough curve can be expressed in terms of normalized Cr(VI) concentration (C/C0), i.e. the ratio between Cr(VI) concentrations in the liquid at the outlet and inlet of the column, in function of the time, fixing the bed height and inlet volumetric flow. The effluent volume (Veff) was determined as follows:\n= ∙V Q teff e (1)\nwhere te (min) the bed saturation time, i.e. the time at which the Cr(VI) concentration in the effluent stream reached 95% of its initial concentration.

Therefore, theoretical models, based on a mass balance approach, should be preferred for the experimental data modelling, to obtain a more accurate estimation of the kinetic and diffusion parameters, necessary for the scale-up of the process on real industrial plants. Two different models were then proposed to interpret the transport phenomena and sorption/reduction process that can occur among Cr(VI) and OS/MICOS particles inside the lab-scale and largelab-scale columns, as already investigated in a previous work [32]. The experimental data set were processed in a non-linear regression procedure for the estimation of model parameters and the scale-effect was evaluated. The mathematical modelling and parameter estimation were accomplished in the gPROMS ver. 3.4 environment [37]."

      "text" : "Fig. 3 displays the influence of inlet flow-rate on the Cr(VI) removal using lab-scale column (Fig. 3a, b) and large-lab-scale column (Fig. 3c, d).\nThe influence of inlet flow-rate was significant in both configurations (lab and large-lab-scale) and for both packing materials, since both tb and te proportionally decreased with the Q increase. More in detail, the tb value in OS-lab-scale configuration decreased from 45min to 15min when the Q value increased from 2 to 6mLmin−1, whereas in OS-large-lab-scale configuration it increased from 120min to 45min when the Q was increased from 28 to 78mLmin−1 (see Table 3). Similar considerations can be drawn focusing on the variation of tb for MICOS system, since it decreased from 270min up to 105min in largelab-scale configuration. Regarding te, an initial value of 660min was reached in OS-lab-scale configuration working with 2mLmin−1, that dropped to 495min when the Q was raised up to 6mLmin−1. Similar\ntrends have already been observed and reported by several authors [41–44].\nThe breakthrough curve shapes of OS-packed lab-scale and largelab-scale were very similar, considering also the less considerable variation of tb and te, with respect to the larger difference among these values for MICOS-packed column tests. However, the breakthrough curve of MICOS-packed lab-scale test was substantially analogous to that of large-lab-scale one.\nA remarkable difference among the qe and AER values reported for lab-scale and large-lab-scale cases was observed. In the former case, the sorption capacity of the column was one order of magnitude larger in comparison with that reported for the latter case, thus implying that, as expected, the scale-up of the process led to a worsening of the overall performances, as also demonstrated by the lower R values obtained in large-lab-scale tests.\nFurthermore, AER increased of about 4–5 times after the process scale-up, thus indicating a decrease in the sorption efficiency [36]. Regarding the MTZ values, it strongly depends on the bed depth and tends to increase with bed depth increase, as reported in Table 3. However, at fixed bed depth value, the sorption efficiency increased with the MTZ decrease, since it is considered to be related to the mass transfer resistance in the column [45]."

      "text" : "The three models introduced in Section 2.3 were implemented in gPROMS software and a non-linear regression procedure was applied to estimate the dynamic parameters using the experimental data previously reported (Fig. 4).\nMod1 was able to well predict the experimental trends obtained through the large-lab-scale equipment, using the same regressed kf value (see Table 4) obtained from lab-scale data (R2 were in the range 0.97–0.99). Conversely, the predicted values obtained using Mod2 were not in agreement with the experimental data, as also shown by the lower R2 values obtained both for the lab-scale data fitting and for the large-lab-scale data description (R2 < 0.9). Indeed, considering the low inlet flowrates adopted and the laminar regime, the film mass transport mechanism may better represent the limiting step of the process in comparison with the solely sorption mechanism. On the contrary, film-diffusion contribution might become negligible in the case of high inlet flowrates [46].\nRegarding the Mod3 predicted values, they were completely in agreement with the large-lab-scale experimental ones when the filmdiffusion mechanism was considered (Eq. (18a)) (Fig. 4b and d), as also validated by the large R2 values (always higher than 0.98). Indeed, the lab-scale data fitting using Mod3 was successfully. On the contrary, when the Eq. (18b) was implemented instead of Eq. (18a) the predicted values through Mod3 were not in agreement with the experimental ones, in both configurations, returning R2 < 0.8 (data nor reported). The regressed parameter values followed a clear trend, since the kf increased with the Q value increased, for both OS and MICOS materials, and the Ka value increased from OS/Cr(VI) to MICOS/Cr(VI) system.\nA more accurate investigation on the obtained film-diffusion coefficient can be made considering the various experimental correlations proposed in several literature studies between Sherwood number (Sh) and Sc and Re [47], reported in Supplementary Materials.\nTable 5 reports the calculated film-diffusion coefficients with the above-reported correlations.\nThe kf values obtained through the lab-scale experimental data regression were of the same order of magnitude of those reported in Table 5 and the same increasing trend with inlet flowrate can be observed for the calculated parameters. As expected, the application of correlation 1 yielded the more similar kf values, since the correlation has been obtained for laminar conditions and for system characterized by very low Re values, as those reported in the present study. These results may contribute to validate the model proposed to describe the\nresults obtained using OS and MICOS materials. In conclusion, the scale-up procedure was considered satisfactory, since the regressed parameter obtained from lab-scale data fitting demonstrated to be suitable as input data for the description of large-labscale results. In addition, a schematic representation of the mass transfer mechanism of the employed models is reported in Fig. 5.\nAccording to the model, the Cr(VI) mass transfer mechanism is based on two subsequent steps: the former is represented by the diffusion of the oxyanion through the liquid film around the particle (Os or MICOS), whereas the latter is represented by the sorption of the pollutant onto the particle surface (OS or MICOS). Regarding the system Cr (VI)/MICOS, a further step has also been considered, i.e. the chemical reaction between Cr(VI) and the iron species (Fe(0) and Fe(II)) that led to the production of a mixed Fe-Cr hydroxide (the mechanism has been already discussed in a previous work [32])."

      "text" : "Cr(VI) removal experiments were performed in lab-scale and largelab-scale fixed-bed reactors, packed with uncoated (OS) and coated biomass (MICOS). Three dynamic models were developed and used in a non-linear regression procedure to estimate mass transfer and kinetic parameters, by evaluating the most appropriate mass transfer mechanism. A maximum Cr(VI) removal efficiency of 68% and 64% were achieved in MICOS/lab-scale and large-lab-scale configurations respectively. The large-lab-scale column, packed with MICOS adsorbent material, was able to treat a notable volume of effluent (30–70 L) at appreciable inlet flow-rate (28–78mLmin−1). Two of the three developed dynamic models were able to well predict the experimental breakthrough curve shapes and sorption data, for large-lab-scale configuration, using the regressed model parameters obtained from the lab-\nscale data fitting procedure. An appreciable difference among fitness goodness of Mod1 (film-diffusion limiting) and Mod2 (sorption limiting) was observed, basing on the larger correlation coefficients obtained for the former model with respect to that obtained for the latter one, in both configurations. This result may indicate that film-diffusion can be considered the limiting step of the process, also taking into account that the adopted flow-rate values were always lower than 100mLmin−1 and thus the liquid film might offer significant resistance to the Cr(VI) mass transfer. Moreover, the film diffusion coefficient\nvalues obtained by the data modelling were similar to those obtained by empirical correlations reported in literature and their values were consistent with the experimental data. The good results clearly showed the successful development of simple technology to be scaled-up on large-lab-scale equipment."

A remarkable Cr(VI) removal efficiency (up to about 65%) was observed in large-lab-scale configuration, thus allowing to treat notable amounts of effluents volumes (30–70 L, basing on the inlet flow-rate) at fixed bed height of 38 cm and a sorbent mass of 850 g and 790 g of uncoated and coated material, respectively. The data obtained from lab-scale experiments at fixed bed height and three different inlet flow-rates were used in a non-linear regression procedure in the gPROMS environment to estimate sorption and kinetic parameters of three developed dynamic models. The regressed parameter values, film mass transfer coefficient kf, sorption kinetic constant Ka and reaction kinetic constant k, were then used as input values for the developed model to model the experimental data obtained at large-labscale. The modelling results demonstrated the suitability of the film-diffusion based model to well fit the labscale data and to model the large-lab-scale breakthrough curves of Cr(VI) removal using both uncoated and coated biomass. For this reason, and also considering the laminar flow conditions, this mass transfer mechanism was considered the limiting step of the Cr(VI) removal process.",
