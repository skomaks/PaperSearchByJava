Especially easy synthesis of nano- and micro-sized particles and low-cost synthesis with non-toxic chemicals are essential. The ability to design nanoparticles according to the application area and desired features is an advantage for many applications. Nanoparticles biosynthesis is under research due to broad biomedical practise. To synthesize of silver nanoparticle from the plant extract, Corylus avellana (Hazelnut) leaves were utilized for bioreduction of silver nitrate. The plant extract is thoroughly mixed with silver nitrate solution, studied the synthesis of nanoparticles using UV–Vis spectroscopy. The nanoparticles were characterized by SEM and XRD-Pattern. XRD analysis proved that the size range of the nanoparticles was 32 nm. Scanning microscope images also demonstrate nanoparticles having spherical shape and a mean size between 9 nm and 50 nm. The antibacterial effect of AgNPs obtained from hazelnut leaves demonstrated antibacterial effect against all tested bacteria strains. The results demonstrated that the plant extract acts as a good bioreductant for the production of silver nanoparticles. This compound was good inhibitor of the a-glycosidase, human carbonic anhydrase I and II isoforms, and cholinesterase enzymes. The results were obtained with Ki values of 12.84 ± 0.41 µM for a-glycosidase, 27.94 ± 3.77 µM for hCA I, 36.12 ± 6.03 µM for hCA II, 47.05 ± 6.83 µM for BChE, and 53.94 ± 7.55 µM for AChE, respectively.\n2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

Uses biological principles and materials to obtain new systems to be developed using nanoscale. During some years, biological systems were familiar to create nanoparticles from microbes [1] and plants [2]. The microbial arbitrated synthesis procedures have some disadvantages, such as identification of potent strain, preservation of aseptic conditions for the abundant growth of microbes, probabilities of contamination and infection [3]. Also, the synthesis of\n80\n81\n82\n83\nnanoparticles from microbes is comparatively expensive and time consuming than plants [4]. It needs about 2–3 days just for the growth of microorganisms.\nSo, by observing all the hurdles, researches focus their points on the plants’ extract. By utilization of the green chemistry process, different plant extracts experienced the capability of synthesizing the dissimilar metal nanoparticles especially silver, iron, gold, lead, palladium, and copper [5–7]. Amongst the different metal nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles were obtaining important potential in whole world, and the researcher publications are also enhancing day by day. However, silver nanoparticles were showed having best anticancer and antioxidant characteristics and could be settled as novel therapeutic agents [8]. Different research papers narrated different processes in accordance with nanoparticles synthesis, their identification techniques, and biological effects.

Nuts are widely used for fruit and shell trade.\nInhibition of enzymes such as cholinesterases, secretases, and monoaminoxidase have been targeted for the therapy of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In particular, recent works have focused on cholinesterase inhibitors. Indeed, the prescribed AD drugs goal to enhance the amount of acetylcholine (ACh) in the brain by inhibiting cholinesterase enzymes. Thus, clinical utilize of cholinesterase inhibitor compounds is sometimes limited due to their harmful effects and moderate benefits to AD patients [9–12]. In clinical therapies, many potential drugs like Meglitinides, Sulfonylureas, Thiazolidinediones, Biguanides, and a-glycosidase inhibitors are utilized to control great blood sugar difficulties (hyperglycemia) [13,14]. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzymes are recorded in a variety of tissue cells where they participate in diverse important biochemical mechanisms like respiration, carbon dioxide, acid-base balance, and bone resorption, ion transport, ureagenesis, lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and electrolyte secretion [15]. Many CA enzymes involved in these mechaisms are important therapeutic aims with the potential to be activated/inhibited for the therapy of a range of disturbances like cancer, glaucoma, edema, obesity, epilepsy, and osteoporos [16,17].\nIn current study focused on green synthesis of AgNPs, which can be easily synthesized, made using renewable and non-toxic reductive and used for pharmaceutical purposes. (Fig. 1). Although high amounts are spent each year for the synthesis of substances used as biological agents, green synthesis nanoparticles are an essential alternative to powder technology synthesized for pharmaceutical purposes. Since hazelnut plants are generally used as fruit, green leaves belonging to this plant are in waste position. In present study, hazelnut leaves, which are agricultural wastes, have been used as bio-reducers and the paper has originality in terms of recycling and utilization of wastes. The purpose of the current research article is to synthesize silver nanoparticles using hazelnut plant leaf extract as a reducing agent for silver ions and to investigate their biological applications and also analyze the enzyme activity studies of AgNPs that is limited numer of papers. It especially contributes to the literature on the enzyme activity studies of silver nanoparticles.\n165\n166\n167\n168\n169\n170\n171\n172\n173\n174\n175\n176"

SEM is an imaging method that can solve particle shape, size, particle distribution, nano, and micro-level surface morphology [41–43]. At this stage, SEM images were taken to measure particle morphology and size of nanoparticles obtained using nut leaf extract as a reducing agent. The data obtained from scanning electron microscopy showed distinct shapes and sizes of nanoparticles (Fig. 5ab). The images were taken at 500 kx, and 200 kx magnifications show different particle sizes ranging from 9 nm to 50 nm. Furthermore, the SEM images obtained at this magnification show that the Ag nanoparticles are coated with a layer about 5 nm thick.

Their study presented that AgNPs is a good antibacterial agent. The penetration of NPs was promoted in Gram-negative bacteria due to thin layer of peptidoglycan.

The hCA I isoform was inhibited by this compound in low micromolar levels, the Ki of which recorded 27.94 ± 3.77 µM. The acetazolamide (AZA), as Standard inhibitor of CAs, showed Ki value of 34.61 ± 3.71 µM against hCA I. The hCA I inhibition effect of this compound was found to be the greater than that of acetazolamide, which was a clinically standard CA inhibitor (Table 2 and Fig. 8). For hCA I, IC50 values of AZA as control and nanosilver compound the following order: nanosilver (24.85 µM, r2: 0.9253) < AZA (31.93 µM, r2: 0.9875). Against the physiologically dominant isoform hCA II, the compound demonstrated Ki of 36.12 ± 6.03 µM (Table 2 and Fig. 8). This compound had high inhibition effect toward hCA II. On the other hand, standard compound AZA showed Ki of 46.16 ± 6.88 µM against hCA II. For hCA II, IC50 values of AZA as positive control and nanosilver compound the following order: nanosilver (30.13 µM, r2: 0.9463)\nPlease cite this article as: N. Korkmaz, Y. Ceylan, P.

CA inhibitors show numerous bioactivities including are associated to many diseases such as glaucoma, obesity, cancer, epilepsy and osteoporosis. CA I, and CA II are involved in important metabolic functions such as gas exchange, and ion transport [57].\nIn the last decade, research for AD treatment has focused on developing cholinergic neurotransmission in brain cells. This mechanism is largely based on the cholinergic hypothesis, which has prompted evaluations on cholinesterase enzymes inhibitors (ChEIs) that increase the central cholinergic neurotransmission by inhibiting ACh degradation. AD treatment includes a cholinergic mechanism that acts on inhibitors of cholinesterase enzymes (ChEIs) and also increases central cholinergic neurotransmission by inhibiting ACh degradation [58]. As can be seen from the results obtained in Table 2 and Fig. 8, this compound effectively inhibited AChE, with Ki value of 53.94 ± 7.55 µM.

Polysaccharides and oligosaccharides cannot be converted into simple sugars like monosaccharides that the body can absorb [60]. Thus, a-glycosidase inhibitors are significant drugs to inhibit the assimilation of carbohydrate molecules in the intestine cells, can be utilized to therapy of T2DM, and impaired glucose tolerance. Therefore, these hypoglycemic factors are applied to patients with early diabetes or combined with other drugs. Miglitol and Acarbose are standard a-glycosidase inhibitor compounds which utilized to clinically treat patients with T2DM [61].

      "text" : "The AgNPs are applied in various applications such as cancer diagnosis and treatment as well as use as drug carriers. The synthesis of these AgNPs with environmentally friendly reducing agents is important for the entire ecosystem. Biosynthesis has been a more preferred method for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles compared to conventional methods using harmful reducing agents such as sodium borohydride, trisodium citrate, free aldehyde, ketone groups, and organic substances. In addition, present study is concentrated on green synthesis without toxic chemicals and recycle of agricultural waste. Biosynthetic AgNPs from nut leaves indicated their presence in the UV–vis absorption spectrum as a strong peak at about 430 nm. XRD analysis proved that the size of the nanoparticles was 32 nm, while STEM images showed that these nanoparticles had a spherical shape and an average size between 9 nm and 50 nm. AgNPs demonstrated an essential antibacterial effect against all bacterial strains tested. AgNPs could be applied as a silver bandage of wounds, pomade containing AgNPs, and additionally as an eco-friendly antibacterial agent for every field in need. Also, we investigated the compound for their inhibition activities against hCA isoforms (I, II), a-glycosidase, and cholinesterases (AChE, BChE). As a result of this study, this compound showed inhibition at the micromolar levels against these enzymes. The synthesized compound was a good inhibitor for hCA I, II isoenzymes, a-glycosidase, and AChE/BChE enzymes, respectively. This type of compound may form 20 the cornerstone for the development of novel antiglaucoma, antiepileptic, anticholinesterase, and anticancer drugs."

    "abstractText" : "Powder technology covers many fields from medicine to material science. Especially easy synthesis of nanoand micro-sized particles and low-cost synthesis with non-toxic chemicals are essential. The ability to design nanoparticles according to the application area and desired features is an advantage for many applications. Nanoparticles biosynthesis is under research due to broad biomedical practise. To synthesize of silver nanoparticle from the plant extract, Corylus avellana (Hazelnut) leaves were utilized for bioreduction of silver nitrate. The plant extract is thoroughly mixed with silver nitrate solution, studied the synthesis of nanoparticles using UV–Vis spectroscopy. The nanoparticles were characterized by SEM and XRD-Pattern. XRD analysis proved that the size range of the nanoparticles was 32 nm. Scanning microscope images also demonstrate nanoparticles having spherical shape and a mean size between 9 nm and 50 nm. The antibacterial effect of AgNPs obtained from hazelnut leaves demonstrated antibacterial effect against all tested bacteria strains. The results demonstrated that the plant extract acts as a good bioreductant for the production of silver nanoparticles. This compound was good inhibitor of the a-glycosidase, human carbonic anhydrase I and II isoforms, and cholinesterase enzymes. The results were obtained with Ki values of 12.84 ± 0.41 μM for a-glycosidase, 27.94 ± 3.77 μM for hCA I, 36.12 ± 6.03 μM for hCA II, 47.05 ± 6.83 μM for BChE, and 53.94 ± 7.55 μM for AChE, respectively. 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of The Society of Powder Technology Japan.
