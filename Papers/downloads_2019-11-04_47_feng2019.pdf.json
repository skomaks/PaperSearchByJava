      "text" : "Supercapacitors with ultrahigh power density, excellent circulation performance and fast recharge capability have attracted significant attractions in many fields [1,2]. Electrode materials as one of components for supercapacitors play a vital role for the development of supercapacitors [3,4].\nAmong electrode materials, porous metal-based nanomaterials show greater advantages in improving electrochemical properties of electrode materials due to its open space, high specific surface area and structural variability [5–7]. Currently, porous nickel (Ni)/cobalt (Co)based oxides nanomaterials with different morphologies and sizes have been widely explored for supercapacitors on account of its high theoretical capacitance, good redox reversibility and environmental friendliness [8–11]. For example, Zhou et al. prepared NiO hybrid\nnanospheres electrodes with capacitance of 508 F g−1 and remarkable cycle stability [12]. Kung et al. synthesized Co3O4 nanosheets and the electrodes exhibited high specific capacitance of 1033.3F g−1 [13]. However, the inferior transmission efficiency between electrolyte and electrode materials in the process of electrochemical reaction limits electrochemical performance of NiO and Co3O4 porous nanomaterials [14–16]. Hence, porous NiCo2O4 nanomaterials are intensively explored and highly anticipated owe to the prominent synergies between the various metal cations [17]. For enhancing electrochemical performance, many researchers combine NiCo2O4 with NiO and Co3O4 to form porous and mixed metal oxides with various morphologies and take advantage of different components effectively, such as NiO/ NiCo2O4 nanosheets [18], Co3O4/NiCo2O4 nanowires [19] and NiO/ NiCo2O4/Co3O4 composites [20].\nIn summary, the improvement of electrochemical performance of\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2019.02.191 Received 28 October 2018; Received in revised form 28 January 2019; Accepted 25 February 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author.

All rights reserved.\nT\nNi/Co-based porous nanomaterials is usually achieved by the following methods: different production methods (hydrothermal method, electrodeposition, chemical vapor deposition…) are employed to prepare Ni/Co-based porous nanomaterials with various morphologies (nanorobs, nanotubes, nanoparticles…) and combining multifarious Ni/ Co-based component to form mixed porous materials [21–25]. However, there is little attention on the pore distribution of porous materials for enhancing electrochemical performance. Shen et al. constructed homogeneous SOM-ZIF-8 materials, which exhibited excellent structural stability and catalytic activities [26]. Deng et al. designed 3DOM MoS2@C mixed porous materials with ordered macroporous nanostructures, delivering amazed discharge capacity and cycling stability in lithium ion battery [27]. On the basis of preparation of porous NiCo2O4/NiO/Co3O4 nanoflowers (NCNs), we adjusted the micro-mesoporous distribution of NiCo2O4/NiO/Co3O4 nanoflowers by adding oxalic acid (H2C2O4), which were denoted as NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs-0.15. The synergistic action of different components and the optimal micro-mesoporous distribution of NCNs-0.1 created superior electrochemical performances during the electrochemical reaction."

      "text" : "Fig. 1 depicts the synthesis procedure of the NiCo2O4/NiO/Co3O4 nanoflowers (NCNs). As for a typical synthesis, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Ni (NO3)2·6H2O are dissolved in PVP mixed solution under stirring. In hydrothermal reaction, PVP is selected as a role of soft-template and the NCNs precursors are produced through crystal growth process of oriented attachment and self-assembly with PVP. The NCNs precursors are transformed into porous NCNs due to thermal decomposition reaction of PVP and metal hydroxide, which can lead to the releasing of gas in the calcination process [28–30].\nThe crystalline structure and chemical oxidation states of the obtained samples are analyzed by XRD and XPS measurements. As shown in Fig. 2(a), all the observed diffraction peaks of NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs-0.15 are unambiguously assigned to those of NiCo2O4 (JCPDS No. 20-0781), Co3O4 (JCPDS No. 42-1467) and NiO (JCPDS No. 65-5745) and no impurity peaks are observed, indicating that NCNs are successfully prepared [10,31]. Furthermore, the full survey XPS spectrum (Fig. 2(b)) of samples indicates the existence of Ni, Co and O elements in the composites. As shown in Fig. 2(c)-(f), the Ni 2p, Co 2p and O 1s spectrum are well fitted by Gaussian fitting method. In Fig. 2(c), the fitting peak located at 855.1 eV and 872.7 eV can be attributed to Ni2+ and the peaks at 856.7 eV and 874.5 eV pertain to Ni3+ [32]. Fig. 2(d) displays the Co 2p spectrum and it can be observed that the fitting peaks at 779.5 and 794.3 eV can be well assigned to Co3+ and the peaks at 781.3 and 796.2 eV correspond to Co2+ [33]. For O 1s spectrum, the fitting peaks at 529.2, 529.6, 531.6 and 533.1 eV could be ascribed to the metal–oxygen bond, numerous hydroxyl groups, low-oxygen coordination and physi/chemisorbed water [34–36].\nThe morphology and microstructure of NCNs are analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Fig. S1 (a) and (c) show the low magnification FESEM images of NCNs-0 and NCNs-0.1. It is obvious that NCNs-0 and NCNs-0.1 all own flower-like structure with more than about 3 μm and 800 nm in average diameter, respectively. In addition, the high magnification FESEM images of NCNs-0 and NCNs-\n0.1 further exhibit the flower-like structure is consist of many interconnected nanosheets which possess a thickness of 10∼ 15 nm as shown in Fig. S1(b) and (d). Comparing to NCNs-0, NCNs-0.1 not only have a more uniform dispersion of flower-like structure (Fig. S1(a) and (c)) but also exhibit noticeable and uniform distribution of pore. Such uniform dispersion and porous structure of NCNs-0.1 are conducive to the diffusion of electrolyte ions and provide more active sites for electrochemical reaction [37–39].\nThe FESEM images of NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs-0.15 are shown in Fig. 3 for exploring the impact of H2C2O4 on the structure\nof NCNs. Fig. 3(a) shows the flower-like NCNs-0 are composed of smooth nanosheets. With increasing of H2C2O4, mesopores with large size begin to emerge gradually as shown in Fig. 3(b)-(d) and illustrations. A spot of mesopores with large size appear in nanosheets and the thickness of NCNs-0.05 nanosheets isn’t affected when the content of H2C2O4 increase to 0.05 g (Fig. 3(b)). When the content of H2C2O4 continuing increases to 0.1 g, a lot of mesopores with large size and uniform distribution appear on nanosheets of NCNs-0.1 and the thickness of nanosheets remain about 10–15 nm (Fig. 3(c)). With the content of H2C2O4 becoming 0.15 g, the number of mesopores with large size of\nNCNs-0.15 is more than NCNs-0.1 and the thickness of nanosheets increases to about 40 nm (Fig. 3(d)). Thus it can be seen that addition of H2C2O4 is conducive for emergence of larger size mesopores, which may adjust distribution of pore on the nanosheets appropriately and enhance electrochemical performance [40–43].\nTo further investigate the microstructure of NCNs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis\nare employed and results are exhibited in Fig. 4. Fig. 4(a)-(d) specific demonstrate that the morphology of NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs-0.15 is flower-like structure which is composed of nanosheets, consistenting with the results of SEM analysis. As shown in Fig. 4(c)-(h), the high-magnification TEM images clearly show the presence of micromesopores on nanosheets of flower-like NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs-0.15. In particular, the number and size of mesoporous are\nincreasing with the augment of H2C2O4. It can be found that micromesopores have the best distribution on NCNs-0.1, implying NCNs-0.1 may provide decent active sites and excellent electrochemical performance [44–46]. However, more mesopores distribute on nanosheets of NCNs-0.15 and micropores is sparse, which greatly reduce the specific surface area of materials and thus weaken electrochemical properties of the materials [47,48]. Fig. 4(i)-(l) and Fig. S3 show the HRTEM images and SAED pattern of NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs-0.15. The calculated lattice spacing of 0.24 and 0.23 nm is indexed to the (3 1 1) and (2 2 2) plane of NiCo2O4. The calculated interplanar distance of 0.14 and 0.21 nm is measured to (2 2 0) and (2 0 0) plane of NiO, respectively. In addition, the lattice spacing is counted to be 0.28, 0.24 and 0.20 nm, which is accordant with (2 2 0), (3 1 1) and (4 0 0) plane of Co3O4, respectively. The results of HRTEM analysis further confirm the coexistence of NiCo2O4, NiO and Co3O4 and excellent crystallinity of products. Furthermore, the Scanning TEM (STEM) confirms the porous characteristics and suitable aperture distribution of NCNs-0.1 precisely (Fig. S2(a)). The distribution of Ni, Co and O element of NCNs0.1 is analyzed by element mapping (Fig. S2(b)-(d)), demonstrating Ni, Co and O element uniformly distribute throughout the whole of NCNs0.1 [49].\nThe specific surface area and pore diameter of samples can be gained by BET and BJH pore size distribution methods to further confirm the result of SEM and TEM analysis about the distribution of pores. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of four samples are exhibited in Fig. 5(a). It can be observed that NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs-0.15 all have the type I/IV isotherms which process a steep increase at low relative pressure and obvious hysteresis loop at medium relative pressure, showing the presence of micropores and mesopores structures in NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs-0.15 [50]. BJH pore size distribution of four samples is exhibited in Fig. 5 (b) and reveals the size of micropores and mesopores. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the sizes of the microporous of NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs0.15 are about 1.96 nm and mesopores of the four samples mainly at range of 4–24 nm, exhibiting extensive distribution of pore size for NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs- 0.15. The detailed information of specific surface area and pore is shown in Table.1. As seen from Table.1 and Fig. 5, NCNs-0.1 own higher specific surface area and excellent pore size distribution, which can provide efficient electrolyte ions channels for rapid ion transfer/diffusion [51]. The results of BET and BJH pore size distribution analysis reveal NCNs-0.1 could be promising and glorious electrode materials for supercapacitors.\nAccording to the results of above analysis, the formation mechanism of NCNs-0.1 with optimal distribution of micro-mesopores could be described as below (Fig. 6). When H2C2O4 isn’t added to reaction system, Ni2+ and Co2+ combine with OH− which is produced in the hydrothermal reaction to form metal hydroxides and NCNs-0 are obtained through calcination process as described in Fig. 6(a) [52–54].\nC2O42− appears around Ni2+ and Co2+ with H2C2O4 adding and they unite to form metal oxalates, which can transform into metal oxides and release CO2 during calcination process (Fig. 6(b)) [55–57]. Different from NCNs-0 precursors which are composed of metal hydroxides, metal oxalates and metal hydroxides coexist in NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs-0.15 precursor [58]. In calcination process, the main source of micro-mesopores of NCNs-0 is decomposition of metal hydroxide and PVP. After introducing H2C2O4, the decomposition of metal oxalates, metal hydroxides and PVP may greatly improve the efficiency of gas release, leading to more micropores and mesopores with large size appear in NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs-0.15 [59]. The crux of gaining NCNs with optimal distribution of micro-mesoporous is the dosage of H2C2O4. Too much H2C2O4 may lead to more mesopores with large size are produced in NCNs and the micropores are “swallowed” by mesoporous with large size, achieving to the poor structural stability of materials and unsatisfactory specific surface area (Fig. 6(c)).\nThree-electrode system with 2M KOH aqueous electrolyte is employed to evaluate the electrochemical properties of NCNs electrodes. As shown in Fig. 7(a), NCNs-0.1 electrodes exhibit a larger area of the CV curve than NCNs-0.05 and NCNs-0.15 at scan rate of 10mV s−1, implying NCNs-0.1 electrodes possesses a better specific capacitance [60]. The charge/discharge curves of NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs-0.15 electrodes at a current density of 5 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 7(b) and it is obvious that NCNs-0.1 electrodes exhibit a longer discharge time than other electrodes. Further, CV curves of NCNs-0.1 electrodes with various scanning rates are displayed in Fig. 7(c). Each of CV curves is provided with distinct redox peaks which represent the Faradaic redox reactions and the sites of oxidation and reduction peaks shift mildly with the increasing of scan rate, indicating NCNs-0.1 electrodes have excellent redox reversibility and electronic conductivity [61]. During electrochemical reaction, the following reactions mainly occur between electrolyte and NCNs-0.1 electrodes: [62,63]\n+ ⇆ + +− −NiCo O OH NiOOH 2CoOOH e2 4\n+ ⇆ +− −NiO OH NiOOH e\n+ ⇆ +− −Co O OH CoOOH e3 4\n+ ⇆ + +− −CoOOH OH CoO H O e2 2\nGCD curves of NCNs-0.1 electrodes with nonlinear feature are shown in Fig. 7(d). It can be observed that all GCD curves of NCNs-0.1 electrodes at various current densities own a distinct voltage plateaus, corresponding to the pseudocapacitance characterization of NCNs-0.1 electrodes. The specific capacitances of NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs-0.15 electrodes at current densities of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 A g−1\nare calculated according to Eqn. (1) and the results are presented in Fig. 7(e). The specific capacitance of NCNs-0.1 electrodes at a current density of 1 A g−1 is calculated to be 1693 F g−1, which is superior to\nNCNs-0 (833 F g−1), NCNs-0.05 (1235 F g−1) and NCNs-0.15 electrodes (978 F g−1). Obviously, NCNs-0.1 electrodes embody higher capacitances than NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.15 and other similar electrodes in previous reports (Table.2). In addition, a high capacitance of 1693 F g−1 for NCNs-0.1 electrodes can be maintained when the current density increases from 1 to 10 A g−1, indicating enhanced capacitance and rate capability of NCNs-0.1 electrodes. The above results of electrochemical test fully demonstrate that NCNs-0.1 is an excellent material for supercapacitor due to NCNs-0.1 is equipped with more reasonable distribution of micro-mesopores than NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05 and NCNs-0.15, which can provide sufficient reaction cites in order to make metal ions (Ni2+ and Co2+) can fully contact with OH− to conduct redox reactions (Fig. 7(f)) [69].\nEIS measurements are carried for further confirming the electrochemical performance of NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs-0.15 electrodes. In the Nyquist plots, the charge transfer resistances (Rct) and the equivalent series resistance (Rs) can be acquired from the diameter of the semicircle and the X-intercept at high frequency region, respectively. Importantly, the semicircle is directly related to charge transfer process of Faradic reactions at the electrolyte and electrode interface and it is obvious that NCNs-0.1 electrodes exhibit lower Rct and Rs value than other electrode based on the Nyquist plots as shown in inset of Fig. 7(g), demonstrating the improved charge transfer resistances [70]. The result further reveals that the material with porous structure and large surface area can provide a wide range of electrochemical reactive sites, ensuring efficient charge transport at the electrolyte and electrode\ninterface [71–73]. Furthermore, the tilt degree of straight line in the low frequency region as shown in Fig. 7(g) represents diffusion resistance and it is obvious that the line of NCNs-0.1 electrodes is more vertical, indicating NCNs-0.1 electrodes have lower diffusion resistance [74]. To evaluate the practical application of supercapacitor, prolonged cycles are used to examine the electrochemical stability of electrodes. Fig. 7(h) shows NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05, NCNs-0.1 and NCNs-0.15 electrode possess excellent cyclic stability. It's worth noting that NCNs-0.1 electrode shows capacitance loss of approximately 12% after 6000 cycles, which is lower than those of NCNs-0, NCNs-0.05 and NCNs-0.15 electrode, demonstrating the superb cycling performance of NCNs-0.1 electrode. In addition, NCNs-0.1 still maintains its flower-like structure with porous features and composition after 6000 cycles, implying the amazing cyclic stability of NCNs-0.1 (inset of Fig. 7(h), Fig. S4). The improved electrical conductivity and cycling performance of NCNs-0.1 electrodes are attributed to its special structure with suitable distribution of micro-mesopores, which can greatly promote more efficient electrolyte ion transportation and build conductive network architecture with outstanding specific surface area [75–78].\nSummarily, NCNs exhibit amazing electrochemical properties due to its micro-mesoporous structure and the synergy between different components (NiCo2O4, Co3O4 and NiO). With the introduction of H2C2O4, the distribution of micro-mesopores for NCNs has been effectively improved. Particularly, NCNs-0.1 which own optimal distribution of micro-mesopores show the best electrochemical properties. The reason is that the effective distribution of micro-mesopores can obtain more electrochemical reaction sites for Faradic reactions, so that more electrolyte ions can effectively contact with the electrode material and charge transport s also improved [85]. Therefore, reasonable design of micro-mesopores is of great significance to the improvement of electrochemistry for electrode materials [26,27].\nTo investigate the practical application, asymmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor which is composed of NCNs-0.1 as the positive electrode, AC as the negative electrode and the PVA–KOH as solid-state electrolyte is prepared, as shown in Fig. 8(a). The CV and GCD curves of AC electrode are shown in Fig. S5. It can be seen that all CV curves of\nAC electrode exhibit symmetrical rectangular shape and GCD curves of AC electrode are almost symmetric, suggesting the feature of electrochemical double layer capacitance [79]. For confirming the best operating potential of NCNs-0.1//AC capacitor, CV curves with different scan voltage windows of the NCNs-0.1//AC capacitor are acquired.\nFig. 8(b) indicates that the CV curves of NCNs-0.1//AC capacitor remain stable and no polarization occurs when the voltage window is extended from 0.8 V to 1.6 V. Hence, it is certain that the operating potential of NCNs-0.1//AC capacitor can reach to 1.6 V. As shown in Fig. 8(c), the CV curves of NCNs-0.1//AC capacitor which are tested under various scan rates display an extensive voltage window of 1.6 V and excellent capacitive behavior, which mainly due to the dedication of NCNs-0.1 and AC electrode [80]. Simultaneously, the GCD curves of NCNs-0.1//AC capacitor at different current densities show almost symmetrical shape of triangles, demonstrating seductive coulombic efficiency and capacitive behavior ulteriorly (Fig. 8(d)). Furthermore, the specific capacitances of NCNs-0.1//AC capacitor are calculated to be 121, 115, 114, 103 and 94F g−1 when current density is ranging from 1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1 (Fig. 8(e)), exhibiting a capacitance retention of 77.6%. The cycling performance of NCNs-0.1//AC capacitor is evaluated and shown in Fig. 8(f). After 2000 cycles, the specific\ncapacitance of NCNs-0.1//AC capacitor can reach 83% of the initial capacity, exhibiting the superior cycling stability of NCNs-0.1//AC capacitor. Based on Eqs. (2) and (3), the energy densities of NCNs-0.1// AC capacitor are calculated to be 43.02, 40.89, 40.53 and 36.62 Wh kg−1, corresponding to power densities of 820.29, 1582.83, 2431.80, 3766.62 and 6680W kg−1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8(g), the energy and power densities of NCNs-0.1//AC capacitor are higher than that of previously reported asymmetric capacitor. Further, three NCNs0.1//AC capacitors are connected in series to light a white light-emitting diode, demonstrating the potential application of NCNs-0.1//AC capacitor. All above attractive results confirm the NCNs-0.1 can offer outstanding electrochemical performance for supercapacitor, which is mainly attributed to the rational design for distribution of micro-mesoporous, supplying more active sites and shorter ion-diffusion pathway during electrochemical reactions [81,82]. Thus, the size and distribution design for micro-mesoporous of electrode materials are worthy of attention when researches devote to study the preparation methods, composition and morphology of porous materials."

Various characterization methods had proved that NCNs-0.1 exhibited optimum distribution of micro-mesopores, explaining 0.1 g H2C2O4 can adjust the distribution of micro-mesopores in preparation process of NCNs effectively. In the aspects of electrochemistry, NCNs-0.1 which provided sufficient reaction cites exhibited a specific capacitance of 1693 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and outstanding cyclic stability. Further, assembled NCNs-0.1//AC capacitor achieved a specific capacitance of 121 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent energy densities\nof 43.02 Wh kg−1 at power densities of 820.29W kg−1. Above results demonstrated NCNs-0.1 could be promising materials for supercapacitors and design for the distribution of micro-mesopores by H2C2O4 as control agent may be an effective method to improve the electrochemical properties of porous electrode materials."

    "abstractText" : "The rational design of micro-mesopores is a hugely challenging for porous metal-based nanomaterials. Here oxalic acid (H2C2O4) as control agent is proposed for the first time to prepare 3D optimal micro-mesoporous NiCo2O4/NiO/Co3O4 nanoflowers (NCNs). Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate NCNs-0.1 which are prepared by adding 0.1 g H2C2O4 possess optimal distribution of micro-mesopores. The optimal structure creates abundant active sites and fluent ionic channels. Beneficially, NCNs-0.1 electrodes deliver an enhanced specific capacitance of 1693F g at 1 A g and outstanding cyclic stability (88% capacitance retention after 6000 cycles). Further, the assembled NCNs-0.1//AC capacitor achieves excellent energy densities of 43.02 Wh kg at power densities of 820.29W kg. The current NCNs-0.1 confirms a practicable method to optimize the electrochemical performances of supercapacitors by utilizing H2C2O4 to construct 3D optimal micro-mesoporous nanoflower architectures.",
