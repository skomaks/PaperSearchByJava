      "text" : "Nanotechnology in the Life Sciences\nNanomaterials and Environmental Biotechnology\nIndu Bhushan Vivek Kumar Singh Durgesh Kumar Tripathi Editors\nNanotechnology in the Life Sciences\nSeries Editor\nRam Prasad School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China\nAmity Institute of Microbial Technology, Amity University,  Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India\nNano and biotechnology are two of the 21st century’s most promising technologies. Nanotechnology is demarcated as the design, development, and application of materials and devices whose least functional make up is on a nanometer scale (1 to 100 nm). Meanwhile, biotechnology deals with metabolic and other physiological developments of biological subjects including microorganisms. These microbial processes have opened up new opportunities to explore novel applications, for example, the biosynthesis of metal nanomaterials, with the implication that these two technologies (i.e., thus nanobiotechnology) can play a vital role in developing and executing many valuable tools in the study of life. Nanotechnology is very diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale, to investigating whether we can directly control matters on/in the atomic scale level. This idea entails its application to diverse fields of science such as plant biology, organic chemistry, agriculture, the food industry, and more. Nanobiotechnology offers a wide range of uses in medicine, agriculture, and the environment. Many diseases that do not have cures today may be cured by nanotechnology in the future. Use of nanotechnology in medical therapeutics needs adequate evaluation of its risk and safety factors. Scientists who are against the use of nanotechnology also agree that advancement in nanotechnology should continue because this field promises great benefits, but testing should be carried out to ensure its safety in people. It is possible that nanomedicine in the future will play a crucial role in the treatment of human and plant diseases, and also in the enhancement of normal human physiology and plant systems, respectively. If everything proceeds as expected, nanobiotechnology will, one day, become an inevitable part of our everyday life and will help save many lives.\nMore information about this series at http://www.springer.com/series/15921\nIndu Bhushan • Vivek Kumar Singh Durgesh Kumar Tripathi Editors\nNanomaterials and Environmental Biotechnology\nISSN 2523-8027 ISSN 2523-8035 (electronic) Nanotechnology in the Life Sciences ISBN 978-3-030-34543-3 ISBN 978-3-030-34544-0 (eBook) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-34544-0\n© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020 This work is subject to copyright.

Nanoscience has added altogether another dimension of change in the direction of the revolutionary advancement in scientific understanding and it is applied across many other new technologies. From the time when nanoscience was introduced several years ago, it has changed our lives significantly – and will continue to do so! It all started in the field of physics “especially in electronics” and later followed in pharmaceutical and chemical sciences. Although the progress in the field of nanotechnology is a contemporary multidisciplinary science which involves the fields of chemistry, physics, engineering, and biology, the production of nanoparticles (NPs), both by humans and in nature, dates back to the pre-Christian era. In the present times, nanoscience and nanotechnology have taken major roles in branches of research and industry which impact human lives and yield unexpected results. However, the core aspect of nanoscience has always been in the betterment of technological applications in various arenas, thus making our daily lives easy and better. It enables quick advancements in a wide array of fields, i.e., economical, environmental, pharmaceutical, industrial, and several others. This book presents a fresh insight into the recent developments taking place into various sectors, consolidating all the knowledge into one place. It is aimed at an extensive array of book lovers with backgrounds in biology, chemistry, medicine, and physics. This book emphasizes that nanotechnologies are now extensively believed to have the capability to benefit diverse areas such as water decontamination, drug development, communication technologies and information, and manufacture lighter and stronger equipment. Each chapter in it gives an account of\nvi\nthe application of nanotechnology in basic sciences and manufacturing, along with the commercial potential of nanomaterials in various industries and environment.\nKatra, Jammu and Kashmir, India Indu Bhushan Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India Vivek Kumar Singh Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India Durgesh Kumar Tripathi\nPreface\nvii\nContents\n1 Nanoparticles and Plant Interaction with Respect to Stress Response . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 Mohammed Shariq Iqbal, Akhilesh Kumar Singh, Satarudra Prakash Singh, and Mohammad Israil Ansari\n2 Nanoencapsulation Technology: Boon to Food Packaging Industries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17 Somenath Das, Anand Kumar Chaudhari, Abhishek Kumar Dwivedy, Neha Upadhyay, Vipin Kumar Singh, Akanksha Singh, and Nawal Kishore Dubey\n3 Ecotoxicity of Metallic Nanoparticles and Possible Strategies for Risk Assessment. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41 Ifra Zoomi, Harbans Kaur Kehri, Ovaid Akhtar, Dheeraj Pandey, Pragya Srivastava, and Raghvendra Pratap Narayan\n4 Tripartite Interaction Among Nanoparticles, Symbiotic Microbes, and Plants: Current Scenario and Future Perspectives . . 55 Ovaid Akhtar, Ifra Zoomi, Dheeraj Pandey, Harbans Kaur Kehri, and Raghvendra Pratap Narayan\n5 Effect of Nanoparticles on Plant Growth and Physiology and on Soil Microbes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65 Muhammad Nafees, Shafaqat Ali, Muhammad Rizwan, Asma Aziz, Muhammad Adrees, Syed Makhdoom Hussain, Qasim Ali, and Muhammad Junaid\nviii\n6 Recent Trends and Advancement Toward Phyto-mediated Fabrication of Noble Metallic Nanomaterials: Focus on Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Palladium. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 87 Satarudra Prakash Singh, Mohammad Israil Ansari, Brijesh Pandey, Janmejai Kumar Srivastava, Thakur Prasad Yadav, Humaira Rani, Ashna Parveen, Jyoti Mala, and Akhilesh Kumar Singh\n7 Development of Environmental Biosensors for Detection, Monitoring, and Assessment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 107 Shagun Gupta and Vipan Kakkar\n8 Nano-Based Materials and Their Synthesis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 127 Shalini Chaudhary, Atin Kumar Pathak, and Shamshad Ahmad\n9 Nano-based Composites and Their Synthesis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 141 Shalok Bharti, Lalit Thakur, Sanjeev Anand, and Varun Dutta"

      "heading" : "1.1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Nanotechnology is an incipient multidirectional technique with extensive applications in cancer remedies, drug delivery, microelectronics, biosensors, and cosmetic production, and also in agricultural fields (Nel et al. 2006; Singh et al. 2016, 2019; Arif et al. 2018; Shweta et al. 2018, 2017; Vishwakarma et al. 2018; Rastogi et al. 2019a, b). However, unspecified discharge of nanoparticles (metallic) into ecological communities has increased worldwide apprehension about their probable toxicity. The length of nanoparticles generally ranges from 1 to 100 nm in at least two dimensions, so that these are extremely fine particles with more surface area (Nowack and Bucheli 2007). Compared to molecules and bulk materials, nanoparticles are intermediate in size. The distinctive physical as well as chemical properties of nanoparticles result from their detachment in bulk material into reduced and smaller pieces (Jefferson 2000). However, because of their nanoscale size, their surface area thus increases, which makes them extremely catalytic or reactive.\nThe haphazard release of nanoparticles into natural environments from industrial effluents leads to their bulk production (Brunner et  al. 2006; Owen and Handy 2007). Thus, most produced nanoparticles consist of heavy metals, toxifying water and soil with metallic nanoparticles, now a concern in environmental degradation. Plant interaction with excess nanoparticles in water and soil may cause the uptake and accumulation of the nanoparticles in the plant, leading to their ultimate conveyance to the ecosystem. However, nanoparticles may persist and be accumulated\nM. S. Iqbal · A. K. Singh · S. P. Singh Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow Campus, Lucknow, India\nM. I. Ansari (*) Department of Botany, University of Lucknow, Lucknow, India e-mail: ansari_mi@lkouniv.ac.in\n2 within the plant, thus causing physical as well as chemical damage to various parts of the plant. Generally, nanoparticles pass into the plant root system through junctions of the lateral roots, thereby reaching the xylem tissue through the pericycle and the cortex (Dietz and Herth 2011). Moreover, although the cell wall restricts the entrance of nanoparticles into the plant body, cell walls have a definite pore size, allowing the transference of nanoparticles smaller than the pore size of the cell wall (Fleischer et al. 1999; Navarro et al. 2008). The degree of penetration is subject to the surface characteristics and dimensions of the nanoparticles. Undeniably, the smaller nanoparticles can pass through the cell wall easily. Larger nanoparticles are unable to pass through the cell wall and thus cannot disturb the metabolic pathways of the cell (Verano-Braga et al. 2014). However, flower stigmas, hydathodes, and stomata possess larger cell-wall openings, so that larger-size nanoparticles can pass through and possibly affect the plant. Chemical and physical interactions of nanoparticles with plants could be a natural or induced phenomenon. Chemical interfaces encompass the production of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS/ RNS) (Nel et  al. 2006), disruption in cell membrane transport activity of ions (Auffan et al. 2008), injury from oxidative stress (Foley et al. 2002; Jalil et al. 2017), and peroxidation of lipids present in the cells of the plant (Kamat et al. 2000). The ensuing admittance into the body of the plant through the cell wall subsequently allows nanoparticles to associate and work as metallic ions, reacting with carboxyl and sulfhydryl groups and eventually modifying protein activity. The effect of nanoparticle applications in shown in Fig. 1.1.\nHowever, while studying engineered nanomaterials that arbitrate ecotoxicity, several artifacts that often lead to misconceptions of outcomes should be considered (Petersen et  al. 2014). These probable aspects consist of noxious scum in engineered nanomaterials, their apposite storage and dissemination in a particular medium. Furthermore, engineered nanomaterials imply unintended effects on plant\nM. S. Iqbal et al.\n3 growth and development by depletion of nutrients with time and the diffusion of the engineered nanomaterials in organisms. Additionally, the dissolution, settling, and agglomeration properties of engineered nanomaterials cause diverse variations all through the study period that are difficult to evaluate accurately. Characteristics such as greater superficial area with distinct physical as well as chemical properties allow engineered nanomaterials to freely interact with ions physicochemically within the nutrient medium, thereby causing unintended toxic reactions such as wilting and chlorosis (Slomberg and Schoenfisch 2012; Begum and Fugetsu 2012; Jalil et al. 2018). Furthermore, as engineered nanomaterials interact with organic acids in the roots of the plant, the pH of the media falls, thereby modifying the nutrient quantity and properties of the engineered materials (Marschner 1995). The ineffectiveness of such interactions and their effects can be observed as an incongruous elucidation of phytotoxicity, and eventually a fictitious impression of engineered nanomaterials is understood (Ma et al. 2010)."

      "heading" : "1.2 The Nanoparticle and Its Role in Plant Stress",
      "text" : "It is been reported that nanoparticles generally possess desired and undesired outcomes on various plant species because of their configuration, dissimilar size, altered physicochemical properties, and the concentrations of different nanoparticles used (Ma et al. 2010; Tripathi et al. 2017). It was reported that carbon nanotubes (multi-walled) substantially exaggerated the upregulation of stress-related gene expression in tomato seed germination and further affected the progress of the seedlings (Khodakovskaya et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2016; Koul et al. 2018). In a finding by Lee et al. (2010), Al2O3 nanoparticles were found to be less toxic than ZnO, SiO2, or Fe2O3 nanoparticles when used to treat Arabidopsis thaliana. Earlier investigations on algae also underscored the noxious effects of nanoparticles (Arouja et  al. 2009). Several nanoparticles such as CeO2, ZnO, TiO2, and Ag nanoparticles were observed to be deposited on the cell-wall surface as well as on the surface of the organelles, which causes stimulation in the form of stress response from oxidative stress within the cell (Buzea et  al. 2007). In another study of Cucurbita pepo, the outcome of showed that seed germination was not altered by treatment with Cu, Si, Ag, and ZnO nanoparticles. On the other hand, their complementary bulk constituents and Cu nanoparticles cause alteration in root length when estimated against the control and a powder of bulk copper (Stampoulis et al. 2009). Treatment with ZnO nanoparticles affected root length in rice plants, but TiO2 nanoparticles had no effect on the roots (Boonyanitipong et al. 2011). In another study, Riahi-Madvar et al. (2012) revealed effects on the roots of Triticum aestivum by treating the plant withAl2O3 nanoparticles at different concentrations, although the nanoparticles did not influence seed germination, shoot length, or fresh weight/dry weight ratio. Treatment of rice seedlings with CuO nanoparticles had an effect on enzymatic activity. Enzymatic antioxidant values were shown to be elicited (Shaw and Hossain 2013). An analogous experiment was conducted by Shaw et al. (2014)\n1 Nanoparticles and Plant Interaction with Respect to Stress Response\n4 wherein treatment of Hordeum vulgare with CuO nanoparticles caused an effect on photosynthetic activity and also on the antioxidants. It was elucidated that the decreased growth of shoot and root length caused poor photosynthetic activity. Furthermore, Atha et al. (2012) showed CuO nanoparticles cause decreased growth and DNA damage in Raphanus sativus, Lolium perenne, and Lolium rigidum plants. Rico et  al. (2013) revealed effects on photosynthetic activity, enzymatic activity, and ascorbate and thiol levels when CeO2 nanoparticles were used to treat rice seedlings. Formation of ROS/RNS and H2O2 when Spirodela punctata plants were treated with Ag and ZnO nanoparticles showed the significant toxicity of these nanoparticles (Thwala et  al. 2013). Among the numerous metallic nanoparticles, ample consideration has been paid to Ag nanoparticles because of their distinctive biological and physicochemical properties when compared to various other largesize nanoparticles (Sharma et al. 2009). The fungicidal and bactericidal properties of Ag nanoparticles have widespread application as an indispensable constituent in various products at domestic, nutritional, and industrial levels (Tran et al. 2013). Silver nanoparticles when compared to silver-based compound nanoparticles possess an enlarged surface area accessible for microbe interface; further, it was reported that such are more noxious to various fungi and bacteria and several viruses as well. Similar to alternate metallic nanoparticles, Ag nanoparticles possess more impact on prompt stress reactions (ROS/RNS) in various microorganisms, algae, animals, and plants (Jiang et al. 2012). Conversely, the stimulus of Ag nanoparticles on plants is basically governed by such factors as plant species, growth and developmental stage, type and concentration of nanoparticles used, and experimental parameters such as period of treatment, humidity and temperature, and method of nanoparticle treatment (Vannini et al. 2013). Ag nanoparticles are one of the most widely examined nanoparticles whose toxic effects have been investigated in numerous plant crops (Stampoulis et  al. 2009; Jiang et  al. 2012; Kumari et  al. 2009). Several studies have revealed that Ag nanoparticles were disadvantageous for plant growth as compared to the growth-enhancing possession of Ag nanoparticles in wetland plants (Yin et  al. 2012), Proteus vulgaris and Zea mays (Salama 2012), Brassica juncea (Sharma et al. 2012), and Eruca sativa (Vannini et al. 2013). Ag nanoparticles showed a chromotoxic outcome on mitotic cell division in Allium cepa (Kumari et al. 2009). Further, Ag nanoparticles intermingle with proteins (are membrane bound) and stimulate various metabolic pathways, which restricts cell propagation (Roh et al. 2012; Gopinath et al. 2010). Some of the numerous effects of nanoparticles on plants are summarized in Table 1.1."

      "heading" : "1.3.1 Phytotoxicity Mechanism of Nanoparticles",
      "text" : "Investigation related to phytotoxicity in higher plants is imperative for elucidating the toxic effect of nanoparticles. Both undesirable and desirable or insignificant effects have been elucidated concerning the potential noxiousness of nanoparticles\n1 Nanoparticles and Plant Interaction with Respect to Stress Response\n6 to various plants (Bystrzejewska-Piotrowska et al. 2009; Sohaebuddin et al. 2010; Muller et al. 2005; Jalil et al. 2018). Various studies point toward nanoparticle toxicity (Ghodake et al. 2010; Stampoulis et al. 2009). A noticeable variation in germination rate and growth was detected in the seeds of rice when exposed to carbon nanomaterials, mainly carbon nanotubes (Wang et al. 2012; Smirnova et al. 2012; Tan and Fugetsu 2007). In the experiment, water content in carbon nanotube-treated seeds was compared to that in control seeds, with better water content observed in the treated seeds. The germinating seeds were supplemented with carbon nanotubes to elucidate the effect on further developmental stages. The findings show significant use of carbon nanotubes to improve the growth of rice seedlings (Smirnova et al. 2012). In another example using Al2O3 nanoparticles, root length elongation was hindered in soybean, carrot, cabbage, cucumber, and corn (Kollmeier et  al. 2000; Yamamoto et al. 2001; Tian et al. 2007; Ryan et al. 1992), whereas nanoparticles of ZnO were found to be maximally toxic, impeding the growth rate of the roots in various plants (Stella et  al. 2010; Ma et  al. 2009; Huang et  al. 2002). Nanoparticles of ZnO were observed to be noxious in high concentrations when used to treat Arabidopsis thaliana plants, where a decreased germination rate was observed, with Al2O3, SiO2, and Fe (II, III) oxide nanoparticles showing a moderate effect (Bin Hussein et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2004; Dwivedi and Randhawa 1974). With consideration for the toxicological aspect, the ratio of particle size to surface area is a vital physical property of a nanoparticle; the lesser the particle size, the greater the surface area. Hence, more of its atoms or molecules are exhibited externally than internally (Fugetsu and Parvin 2011; Begum et al. 2011). Several studies revealed surface properties of nanoparticles to be more toxic with a higher toxicity level than finer particles of the same material (Clarke and Brennan 1989; Kashem and Kawai 2007): this has been experimentally demonstrated by the use of diverse types of nanoparticles, such as cobalt, nickel, titanium dioxide, and carbon black. It was observed that TiO2 nanoparticles with a minimum size less than 30 nm consequently are 43 fold more inflammatory than nanoparticles larger than 200 nm (Feizi et  al. 2012; Castiglione et  al. 2011; Qiu et  al. 2013). Numerous investigations revealed that nano-sized particles are somewhat more toxic than micro-sized particles (Currie and Perry 2007). It was elucidated that one of the important parameters of noxiousness of nanoparticles is surface area. For instance, crystalline TiO2 did not exhibited more severe toxicity than shown by TiO2 nanoparticles (Stephen et al. 2012; Han et al. 2010). Generally, the present phytotoxic outline of nanoparticles is somewhat hypothetical; initially, the effects of nanoparticle properties are not well understood and further investigation on toxic effects is necessary, particularly on valuable food crops (Groppa et al. 2008). Thus, it can be concluded that various investigations have revealed that direct exposure to a particular kind of nanoparticles instigated a noteworthy phytotoxic effect, underscoring the necessity for environmental accountability for discarding wastes containing nanoparticles. Further studies on the influence of nanoparticles on valuable food crops and on the environment are required. M. S. Iqbal et al.\n7"

      "heading" : "1.3.2 Uptake Mechanism of Nanoparticles",
      "text" : "Investigations on the mechanism of uptake of nanoparticles in plants lack reliable and widely acceptable information (Nevius et  al. 2012). Previous observations showed that nanoparticles may adhere to the plant root system and cause physicochemical changes during uptake within the plant (Hartley and Lepp 2008; Taylor and Foy 1985). Currently, various investigations emphasize revealing the interface mechanism of nanoparticles toward plants (Besson-Bard et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2017; Ma et al. 2018). Nanoparticle uptake and accumulation may differ depending on the difference in size and type of nanoparticle within the plant. Undeniably, validation of the mechanism of nanoparticle uptake is very restricted, and it depends on the concentration applied (Smirnova et al. 2012). Thus, most of the investigations reported do not yield similar outcomes for diverse forms (shapes and sizes) of nanoparticles (John et al. 1972). The majority of information is related to metalbased nanoparticles such as TiO2, ZnO, Ag, Au, or Fe that correspond to a particular germination stage of the plant. Various possibilities have been suggested for nanoparticle uptake by the cells of the plants. Studies have suggested that nanoparticles move in plant cells by binding with protein biomolecules or ion channels, or through the process of endocytosis by means of new pores formed, finally binding to some organic molecule (Maine et al. 2001; Kurepa et al. 2010). For such investigations, carbon nanotubes have been preferred over other nanoparticles (Smirnova et al. 2012). However, it was reported that nanoparticles when compared to the bulk metals cause more reactivity by the greater surface area to mass ratio (Yuan et al. 2011). Subsequently, the nanoparticles might align with membrane transporters to form complexes as the root absorbs these and transports the particles into the plants. Thus, nanoparticles have been identified that can recognize ion transporters and be readily taken up by the plant (Tani and Barrington 2005). Selectivity among types of plants and the uptake of nanoparticles, which is still not very clear, is an area of further investigation."

      "heading" : "1.3.3 Translocation Mechanism of Nanoparticles",
      "text" : "Several investigations supported that the translocation of nanoparticles is determined by the quantity delivered and the species of plant (Yang and Ma 2010). Specific nanoparticles move swiftly within the plant, forming interactions with other biomolecules. Thus, the other nutrients are estimated according to the translocation of the nanoparticles applied (Zhu et  al. 2008). The mechanism of translocation is instigated by the permeation of nanoparticles, into first the cell walls and then the plasma membrane of the cells. Through conduction by the plant xylem, the uptake mechanism and nanoparticle transferences take place in the shoot system\n1 Nanoparticles and Plant Interaction with Respect to Stress Response\n8 (Pola et al. 2012; Birbaum et al. 2010). The pore size of the cell wall is a vital criterion for the selection of nanoparticles, determining which nanoparticles can penetrate. As was investigated in Allium porrum, nanoparticle penetration was swifter in stomata than in the leaf (Birbaum et al. 2010).\n1.3.4 Interaction Mechanism of Nanoparticles Leading to Stress\nFor the past few decades, the phytotoxicity of nanoparticles has been extensively investigated in several plant species, mainly focusing morpho-physiologically and biochemically. Nevertheless, only a few experiments have been focused on nanoparticle interaction with biomolecules with consideration of proteomics and causes of stress in the plant. Mirzajani et al. (2014) revealed by proteomic technique (gelbased) that the interaction of Ag nanoparticles on Oryza sativa causes toxicity. This investigation, based on root proteomics, elucidated that Ag nanoparticle-associated proteins were mainly related to the oxidative stress pathway, transcription, cell-wall synthesis, ion signaling and its regulation, division of cells, and degradation of protein. The effect of nanoparticles on the cell leading to such alterations is shown in Fig. 1.2. It was further observed that elicitation of enzymatic antioxidants such as peroxidases, glutathione-S-transferase, L-ascorbate, and superoxide dismutase induces enhanced formation of ROS under Ag nanoparticle treatment stress (Vannini et al. 2013). When Ag nanoparticles and AgNO3 compounds were applied to Erruca sativa roots, both forms of silver produced alterations in the proteins associated with cellular homeostasis and redox regulation. These outcomes showed that the noxiousness of Ag nanoparticles mainly derives from its distinctive physicochemical characteristics (Vannini et al. 2013). Under flooding stress, the toxicity mechanism of Ag nanoparticles was studied in early stages of Glycine max plants, showing that proteins associated with signaling pathways, and the metabolism of cells and stress response, were altered. Furthermore, glyoxalase, an enzyme related to the detoxification pathway, was also degraded by Ag nanoparticle treatment (Mustafa et al. 2015a, b). In another study by Mustafa et al. (2015a, b), wherein the effects of Ag, ZnO, and Al2O3 nanoparticles were compared for treating Glycine max plant under flooding stress, protein synthesis was degraded, and glycolysis and lipid metabolism were also affected. Such investigations exhibit the interaction of nanoparticles with plants, but more research is needed to fully elucidate such effects. Thus, the desired as well as undesirable effects of nanoparticles can be observed on plants depending upon the requirements. Future investigations on interaction of nanoparticles with plants would help elucidate better understanding, implying specific nanoparticles can be applied to plants for desired outcomes, which may lead to better agricultural yields.\nM.

Further investigations are needed to fully elucidate whether metallic nanoparticles wield their noxious effects because of their distinctive characteristics or the loose metallic ions.

Various food-borne pathogens like bacteria, fungi, and insects not only invade the food but also alter their nutritional profile by producing toxic metabolites (Scallan et al. 2011; Marin et al. 2013; Kim et al. 2003; Park et al. 2003; in’t Veld 1996). Fungi, most importantly belonging to the species of Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium, are the major contributors for food and feedstuff spoilage. They produce mycotoxins, viz., aflatoxins, fumonisins, ochratoxins, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone. Among these mycotoxins, aflatoxins in particular aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) produced mainly by different species of Aspergillus are a severe concern as it pose carcinogenic, teratogenic, mutagenic, and immunosuppressive potential. Based on the toxicity, it has also been recognized as class I human carcinogen (IARC 1993). The consumption of these contaminated products may have a direct effect on the consumer’s health in the form of chronic and acute toxicity. It is estimated that annually around 200 deaths of adults and 40% of children’s death up to 5 years are due to illness caused by consumption of contaminated foods (WHO 2017). In order to reduce these harmful contaminants from food, several physical methods like heating, UV or ionizing radiation, membrane filtrations (Farkas 2007), and use of synthetic chemical preservatives, viz., potassium bromate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (Inetianbor et al. 2015), are widely used; however their irrational use may cause pest resistance and adverse effect on humans as well as on the environment, which has enforced the scientists to look toward natural food preservatives in order to meet sustainable food security (Damalas and Eleftherohorinos 2011)\nS.

Dubey (*) Department of Botany, Center of Advanced Study, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India\n18\nSince antiquity, plant products in different forms like powder or extracts have been used as preferred alternatives for the protection of food commodities from storage contaminants; however plant products in the form of essential oils are of great concerns as they are volatile, biodegradable, with no residual toxicity, safe to mammalian system, and eco-friendly (Isman 2000; Burt 2004). Many literatures also claim the importance of essential oils as the source of natural preservatives in view of their strong antimicrobial and antioxidant potential (Tripathi et al. 2009; Sánchez-González et al. 2011). Although, essential oils have merit over chemical preservatives, they often fail to exert their full preservative potential, due to oxidation and instability in presence of heat, light and other abiotic factors (Prakash et al. 2018).\nIn view of these obstacles, introduction of nanotechnology has revolutionized the food industry for the progress of nano based formulation of essential oils and other bioactive components, to achieve major goal of sustainable food preservation and security. Nanoparticles enclosing active principles are claimed to enhance the efficacy of bioactive components, as well as the stability, texture, taste and flavor of food products.\nBased on the above background, the present chapter provides an overview of currently employed nanotechnologies and their application in food sectors to develop an approach for the preservation of food during storage in order to achieve sustainable food security."

Das et al.\n23\n2003). Utilization of essential oils through packaging provides protection against three major classes of external factors, viz., chemical, physical, and biological. Therefore, current researchers are focussing on modern delivery systems for encapsulation and release of essential oil vapors in a controlled manner. Since, food industries are facing numerous challenges in developing healthy, safe, and environmentally acceptable foods (Neethirajan and Jayas 2011), nanotechnology may be exploited successfully as one of the important tools to improve production and preservation of food, for  extending shelf life (Roco 2002). Nanoencapsulation deals with the reduction in size of the coating materials up to 1 μm having the bioactive components enclosed in a tight matrix. The involvement of essential oil based nanotechnology for efficient food packaging supports the preservative potential in terms of controlled release, greater surface area to volume ratio and optimized interaction with food components. Another important point of food packaging is the selection of suitable active packaging polymers, which do not interact with the organoleptic properties of food viz. flavor, color, taste and texture. The most commonly used matrix materials for edible thin film packaging of food products are chitosan, gelatin, carrageenan, polylactic acid, and alginate. These edible films are commonly developed by carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids acting as a barrier of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other soluble gases providing off-flavors and odors. Among different polymeric matrices, montmorillonite (MMT) has been used by some workers due to associated benefits of potential release of antimicrobial compounds and controlled permeability of the gas and water vapor inside the packaging matrix (Fabra et al. 2009).\nPolymeric particles are generally of two types, i.e., nanocapsules and nanospheres. Incorporation of essential oils into the polymeric matrix provides significant antimicrobial and antioxidant properties for control of microbial contamination in the food products. Essential oils get conjugated with these polymeric materials and constitute a biocompatible nanoparticle. The antimicrobial property of developed packaging  film greatly rely  over the  ratio of essential oil and polymeric matrix utilized. Encapsulation of essential oil enhances effective concentration of bioactive components in the food system especially in water-rich phases or solidliquid interphases where microbial contamination occurs. For instance, nanoencapsulated terpenes and D-limonene showed significant efficacy against Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Escherichia coli (Donsì et al. 2011). Gaysinsky et al. (2005) performed nanoencapsulation of two important essential oil components eugenol and carvacrol with different nano-based surfactant for enhancing antimicrobial efficacy against pathogenic microbes. Citronellal, one of the major components of the Eucalyptus citriodora essential oil encapsulated in chitosan matrix, has shown better antifungal, antioxidant, and insect repellant activity with significant distribution and polydispersity (Ribeiro et al. 2014). Encapsulation of Zataria multiflora essential oil within chitosan nanoparticle significantly inhibited the growth and sporulation of Botrytis cinerea in the storage condition at 4 °C (Mohammadi et al. 2015). Essential oil loaded nanoemulsion delivery system is widely acceptable for practical application being stable, transparent and colloidal in nature. The use of oregano essential oil nanoemulsion with active preservative potential against\n2 Nanoencapsulation Technology: Boon to Food Packaging Industries\n24\nListeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, and Escherichia coli on fresh lettuce has recently been reported by Bhargava et  al. (2015). Recent findings of mandarin essential oil enclosed within modified chitosan-based coating for beans have been investigated for large-scale future application (Severino et  al. 2014; Donsì et al. 2015). The schematic representation of preparation and role of nanoparticle-based delivery system in food industries is represented in Fig. 2.3.\nThere are different delivery systems used to achieve maximum oil concentration and efficient antimicrobial activity in food system. The most common delivery systems are emulsions, suspensions, and liposomes which are colloidal particles associated with essential oils as internal core materials, acting as good delivery system with potential sustained release properties and significant activity against fungi and other microbes (Gomes et al. 2011). Essential oil loading within different biopolymeric matrices following a variety of fabrication techniques, viz., interfacial polymerization, solvent evaporation, and emulsification, has been demonstrated to maintain good quality and stability of nanoparticles in storage practices (Akrachalanont 2008).\nS.

However, volatile nature of essential oils and physico-chemical degradation by abiotic factors limits their long term application. Therefore, use of nano based delivery system may provide the efficient way to control the pests by involving different mode of action on cells leading to cell lysis and subsequent death. The smaller size of nanoparticles allows them to traverse within the cells culminating into loss of cellular activity. Furthermore, the lipophilic chemical components of essential oils can also easily cross the plasma membrane of fungi and insects and cause different enzymatic alterations and biochemical dysfunction inside their body (Lee et  al. 2004). Inhibition of fungal membrane ergosterol by different essential oils has been actively reported by Tian et al. (2012). The active ingredients of essential oils can be used as potent repellant, fumigant, antifeedant, and insecticidal agent. In general, the terpenoids and phenolic components of essential oils target nervous system of insect by interfering with functions of enzymes such as acetyl choline esterase (AChE) or neurotransmitters such as octopamine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In insects, the toxic effects on octopamine neurotransmitter, GABA gated chloride channel and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase may ultimately cause hypersensitivity, convulsions and paralysis of organs (Enan 2001). Besides their lipophilic nature, the bioactivity of essential oil also depends on different functional groups (nature and position), volatility, and molecular weight of compounds. Acetate-derived methyl groups and double-bonded benzene ring of eugenol, safrole, and limonene actively take part in knockdown of different enzymes and fumigant toxicity of Spodoptera litura, Callosobruchus chinensis, Tribolium castaneum, and other storage insects. Lower  solubility, higher  volatility and oxidation tendency, are the major problem in practical application of essential oil for post harvest pest management. These problems may be effectively resolved to a greater extent by nanoencapsulated essential oil-based pesticides (nanopesticides) or nanoformulated essential oil. Christofoli et  al. (2015) reported on Zanthoxylum rhombifolium essential oil loaded nanospheres against Bemisia tabaci. Silver nanoparticles loaded with bioactive principles of Aristolochia indica showed maximum larvicidal, repellant, and cytotoxic effect on Helicoverpa armigera (Siva and Kumar 2015).

Thus, nanoemulsion characterization is a major aspect not only in the early stage but also during long-term storage. Generally, storage practices occur in varied environmental conditions that may be quite useful to enhance the stability and activity of the nanoemulsions. Furthermore, under certain conditions, nanoemulsions may become unstable due to gravitational separations resulting primarily in the differences in densities as observed by densitometric studies (Chung and McClements 2018)."

Droplets may get associated with each other without interfering their original size, and this process is known as flocculation. In addition, a number of nano-droplets may come across each other and form a large droplet by the process known as coalescence.\nHowever, for effective commercial applications, it is necessary to avoid nanodroplet aggregation as much as possible. For this, attractive forces, viz., hydrophobic and van der Waals forces, may be compensated by the repulsive forces, viz., electrostatic and steric actions between the nano-droplets. In addition, the decreased nanoparticle size is correlated with reduction of nano-droplet aggregation (Degner et al. 2014). According to McClements (2004), along homogenization, differences in soluble phases and emulsifier concentration and types are the governing factors regulating the size of the droplets.

Besides ionic concentration, pH of nano-suspension also has considerable impact over strength of electrostatic interactions depending on charge potential on nanoparticle surface (McClements 2004).\nNanoparticles consisting of protein-coated fat droplets have strong affinity toward flocculation when ionic strength of nano-suspension exceeds beyond a certain level because of electrostatic screening and ion binding effects (De La Fuente et al. 1998). Moreover, addition of salt to the nanoemulsion prior to or after homogenization may influence the stability and aggregation of nanoparticles (Kim et al. 2005). Similar effects are also observed when pH value of nanoemulsion is near to their isoelectric point (Demetriades and McClements 1998).

A nanobiosensor is also called as a second-generation biosensor due to the involvement of ultrasensitive nanoparticles and their effective transducers (Sagadevan and Periasamy 2014). The major advantages of using nanomaterials in biosensing are the combined effect on biological receptor molecules and higher surface to volume ratio (Kumar et  al. 2012). Among different synthesized nanoparticles, metal nanoparticles, carbon nanoparticles, semiconductor quantum nanoparticles, and magnetic nanoparticles have been used for detection of food allergens. Metal nanoparticles, basically colloidal gold, have been successfully used in DNA biosensing based on their amount of immobilized biomolecules in an active sensor (Cai et al. 2002).

The microencapsulated essential oils having antimicrobial agents are used in efficient smart packaging, an effective approach in food industries (de Barros Fernandes et al. 2014). Use of nanoparticles for the improvement of food processing involves different biological aspects such as effective preservative potential, targeted and controlled release of bioactive components, high absorption rate related to greater surface area, high availability, and improved organoleptic properties. Active antimicrobial effect, improved barrier properties and biosensing properties have been applied in nanopackaging of food materials. The active use of nanosensors for pathogenic microbes and toxin detection in stored foods is an important aspect of nanotechnology during transportation. Nanoparticles are efficient due to selective binding and easy removal of pathogens from food surface (Duncan 2011). Industrial application of encapsulated essential oil in food systems is a very limited approach until now. Wu et al.

Several forms of biopolymers such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fats are  present in the  nanorange in  variety of food items (Magnuson et  al. 2011; Cockburn et  al. 2012). Even the digestive processes (mechanical/chemical) performed in the gastrointestinal tract leads to the conversion of complex food structures into simple forms of mono−/disaccharides, fatty acids, or amino acids/ peptides, which can be included under nano−/micro-material range (Martirosyan and Schneider 2014). Such nanomaterials formed in the gastrointestinal tract are subjected to absorption or translocation into the blood/lymph through the gut epi-\nS. Das et al.\n31\nthelia (Powell et al. 2010). Thus, it should be made clear that the gut lumen and epithelia are well exposed to various nanomaterials ingested orally via food.\nThe major concern of nanomaterial usage in food packaging is “leaching out” of active ingredients from the packaging materials into the food items. The incorporation of nanomaterials in the food as stabilizers, anticaking agents, in order to improve the shelf life, odour, taste and aroma, will also increase the chances of oral entrance (Laloux et al. 2017). In this context, there are several issues, most importantly the very small size of nanomaterials favoring the greater absorption through the intestinal/gut epithelia (Martirosyan and Schneider 2014). If there is a possibility of internalization and retention in cells or tissues, the nanomaterials could enter into the food chain. After entry, the nanomaterials may get coated with lipids/proteins as such forming a “corona” which facilitates the absorption, thus making the nanomaterial biofunctional (Bellmann et al. 2015). This corona stage is not stable and is subjected to alterations under changing macromolecules and environmental conditions it encounters. This property complicates the expected behavior of nanomaterials as well as the absorption/metabolic profile of food components inside the gastrointestinal tract. Such unknown effects associated with the nanomaterial behavior inside the gut have been termed as the “Trojan horse effect” (Park et al.\n2 Nanoencapsulation Technology: Boon to Food Packaging Industries\n32"

The nanomaterial may get excreted via feces if not allowed to pass through the epithelia. However, if it gets absorbed/translocated into the blood/lymph, it has the passage to stream through different compartments of the body (Bellmann et al. 2015). The consequences of nanomaterial acquisition in different body parts have been demonstrated in vitro (Owens III and Peppas 2006; Corbalan-Penas 2010; Athinarayanan et al. 2014). Factors governing the fate of nanomaterials inside the body include dose, particle size, shape, charge, solubility, reactivity, and surface coating. The lipid bilayer of the cell membrane has been speculated as the primary target of nanorange materials. Pores formed in the membrane due to nanomaterials lead to cytotoxicity. The nanomaterials have been shown to induce ROS (reactive oxygen species) and RNS (reactive nitrogen species; nitrosative stress) production (Athinarayanan et al. 2014). The oxidative imbalance\nS. Das et al.\n33\ninside the cell has also been shown to activate the pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammasome-mediated inflammation (Dankovic et al. 2007; Moos et al. 2011). Genotoxicity induced by nanomaterial interaction could result in direct interaction with genomic DNA or indirectly through ROS generation (Singh et al. 2017).\nIn conclusion, it is essential to perform safety assessment of nanomaterials before their application in food packaging or processing. Cockburn et  al. (2012) have provided a five-step systematic approach in this connection. Therefore, definite description as well as the comprehensive characterization of the nanomaterials is vital, followed by risk evaluation through utilization of “decision tree,” whether the properties favor the need of detailed investigations on toxicological testing or not."

Nanobiotechnology in food packaging has immense potential to preserve food quality and nutritional profile by serving as antimicrobials and barriers against UV rays, gas, and moisture. To date, various methods have been proposed to encapsulate the bioactive compounds in an array of nano-vehicles to facilitate the stability as well as efficacy. Although research toward nanopackaging has gained momentum, still a lot of questions remained unanswered regarding their fate in the biological systems, environmental impacts, consumer acceptance, effects over sensory profile, and the cost to benefit ratio. Moreover, consumers face hesitation in accepting the incorporation of nanotechnology in the food system. Nanosensors incorporated in plastic packaging could be very much effective against detection of food contamination and spoilage (Thiruvengadam et al. 2018). Rigorous research over safety evaluation together with efforts for increasing the consumer’s acceptance should be in priority to further explore the application of nanotechnology in food industries.\nAcknowledgments SD and AKC are thankful to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, for providing research fellowship.

Various distinctive properties of nanoparticles such as electronic (Kim et al. 2007), optical/photonic (Chan et al. 2013), magnetic (Mornet et al. 2006), and catalytic (Nasrollahzadeh et al. 2015) have significant roles in daily human life. Fundamentally, nanoparticles are categorized in two groups: (i) carbon-containing nanoparticles and (ii) metal-containing nanoparticles. Carbon-containing nanoparticles are made of carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. However, most of the metal-containing nanoparticles are made from metals such as gold (Au), iron (Fe), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), and metal oxides such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), antimony oxide (Sb2O3), cerium dioxide (CeO2), copper oxide (CuO), nickel oxide (NiO), iron oxide (FeO), and zinc oxide (ZnO).\nMetallic nanoparticles are important because of their physical, chemical, and optoelectronic properties. Metallic nanoparticles have been used in various products with different purposes, such as sensors (Li et al. 2007), as catalysts in various processes (Carnes and Klabunde 2003), drug delivery (Hola et al. 2015), sunscreens (Gulson et al. 2015), solar-driven energy production (Sau et al. 2010), and in pollutant remediation (Kamat and Meisel 2003; Choopun et al. 2009; Raman and Kanmani\nI.

Additionally, nanoparticles have been shown to inhibit microorganism growth by exhibiting antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties (Padmavathy and Vijayaraghavan 2008; Khatami et al. 2015; Rai et al. 2016). As metallic nanoparticles are widely used, their exposure is likely to increase substantially, and they interact negatively with microorganisms, green plants, animals, human beings, and their surrounding environment (Navarro et al. 2008; Wise et al. 2010; Singh et al. 2016, 2019; Shweta et al. 2017, 2018; Arif et al. 2018; Vishwakarma et al. 2018).

Various physical and chemical methods are used for the production of metallic nanoparticles (Tripathi et al. 2017; Koul et al. 2018). For the synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles, stabilized precipitation and flame pyrolysis are commonly used methods (Christian et al. 2008). Monodisperse nickel phosphide (Ni2P) nanorods and nanoparticles are made by a one-step solution-phase route (Li et al. 2015). Moreover, there is growing interest in the controlled synthesis of metallic nanoparticles (Wiley et al. 2005; Xia et al. 2009). However, these methods have certain drawbacks because of the use of poisonous chemicals and radiation and are an expensive process. Therefore, academic research is shifting toward biological synthesis of metallic nanoparticles, as it is rapid, feasible, and more productive relative to its cost. In this context, microorganisms have an increasingly critical role as they can provide inorganic materials either intra- or extracellularly for the synthesis of nanoparticles (Simkiss and Wilbur 1989; Mann 1996). Numerous microorganisms such as bacteria (Shahverdi et al. 2007; Saifuddin et al. 2009; Pantidos and Horsfall 2014), actinomycetes (Abdeen et al. 2014; Golinska et al. 2014), algae (Singaravelu et al. 2007; Aruoja et al. 2009; Abboud et al. 2014), and fungi (Mukherjee et al."

In the textile industry, silver nanoparticles are used to prepare cotton fibers that exhibit antibacterial activity (Durán et al. 2007). It has been reported that Ag or Au nanoparticles extracellularly produced from Fusarium oxysporum can be used to prevent or to reduce the infection of Staphylococcus aureus (Durán et al. 2007). Moreover, metallic nanoparticles are of great scientific importance regarding their catalytic activity in various metal-based reactions (Hvolbæk et al. 2007). Metallic nanoparticles also show superior catalytic activity in the reduction and removal of dye. For instance, gold nanoparticles are reported to catalyze the reduction of dye in the presence of stannous chloride (Gupta et  al. 2010). Silver and gold nanoclusters were reported to catalyze the reduction of methylene blue dye (C16H18ClN3S) by arsine in micellar medium (Kundu et al. 2002). Köhler et al. (2008) reported that the catalytic activities of nanoparticles enhanced the bleaching of the organic dyes. However, catalytic activity of metallic nanoparticles also varies from metal to metal. For instance, the Ag nanoparticle was found to be superior to Au and Pt colloid in catalyzing chemiluminescence from the luminol–hydrogen peroxide system (Guo et al. 2008). Despite the aforementioned antibacterial and catalytic activity of metallic nanoparticles, the optical properties of\n3 Ecotoxicity of Metallic Nanoparticles and Possible Strategies for Risk Assessment\n44\na metallic nanoparticle also offer a manageable tool for particle sorting and sensing, for instance, in optoelectronic devices (Djurišić et al. 2010; Choi et al. 2013) and in sensing devices (Ankamwar et al. 2005).\nIn the medical field, metallic nanoparticles are used to develop an aggregationbased immunoassay for anti-protein A (Thanh and Rosenzweig 2002), and for treatment of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Mukherjee et al. 2007) and oral cancer (El-Sayed et al. 2005).\nNanoparticles have also found application in remediation of contaminated environments (Li et al. 2006). There are several studies on the application of nanoparticles for remediation of various pollutants such as metals, organic pollutants, and dyes (Mak and Chen 2004; Hoch et al. 2008; Cheng et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2016).

Metallic nanoparticles show toxic effects on various organisms (Table 3.1). Ge et al. (2011) reported that TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles reduced the biomass of a microbial community. Among microbial communities, nitrogen-fixing bacteria are an important component of the soil ecosystem as they maintain soil health and fertility. Cherchi et  al. (2011) reported bactericidal effects of TiO2 nanoparticles in Anabaena variabilis. Toxicity of nanometal oxides in aquatic ecosystems has also been studied by various research groups (Blaise et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2009; Pradhan et al. 2012; Miller et al. 2012). Federici et al. (2007) reported that the gills of Oncorhynchus mykiss showed sensitivity toward TiO2 nanoparticles. Furthermore, TiO2 nanoparticles were reported to inhibit the growth of Desmodesmus subspicatus at higher concentrations (HundRinke and Simon 2006). However, the toxicity of metallic nano-sized particles in an aquatic ecosystem is debatable (Sharma 2009) as their physicochemical properties are dissimilar from their ionic and bulk form (Christian et al. 2008). Moreover, soluble ions released from metallic nanoparticles appear be the main cause of ecotoxicity (Aruoja et al. 2009). Green plants are also affected by metallic nanoparticles as these particles enter into the plant by various means such as stomata, cuts or wounds, and through the roots. Zn and ZnO nanoparticles negatively affect the growth of Raphanus sativus (radish), Brassica napus (rape), and Lolium perenne (ryegrass) (Lin and Xing 2007). Similarly, Yang and Watts (2005) reported the toxicity of alumina nanoparticles in Brassica oleracea (cabbage), Daucus carota (carrot), Zea mays (corn), Cucumis sativus (cucumber), and Glycine max (soybean).

However, it has been hypothesized that uptake of nanoparticles in animal bodies takes place through the gut (Baun et al. 2008) by various mechanisms such as diffusion through cell membranes, via endocytosis and adhesion (Geiser et al. 2005; Kim et al. 2007). In other biotic components (plants, algae, fungi) the cell wall restricted the entry of nanoparticles as it acts as a barrier. However, small-sized nanoparticles enter the cell via the pores in the cell wall (Zemke-White et al. 2000), and further interaction of these small-sized nanoparticles with the cell wall might increase the pore size, resulting in the internalization of large-sized nanoparticles (Navarro et al. 2008). After passing through the cell wall, endocytosis takes place (Navarro et al. 2008), and inside the cell nanoparticles bind with various cellular structures, thereby inhibiting cellular activity or damaging the cell organelles. Plants interact more frequently with nanoparticles by the presence of stomata, cuts or wounds, and the large surface area of leaf and roots (Navarro et al. 2008)."

Gold nanoparticles have been reported to puncture the cell membrane (Tsao et al. 1999) and alter the cell shape and enzymatic activity (Liu et al. 2004).\nMetallic nanoparticles also generate oxidative stress in biological systems by the production of ROS. ROS disrupt the influx and efflux of electrons and ions, disrupt membrane permeability, and reduce glutathione content inside the cell (Limbach et  al. 2007). ROS increase the permeability of cell membrane by oxidization of double bonds of fatty acids. It has also been reported that TiO2 nanoparticles have photocatalyst properties (Khus et al. 2006) and, with exposure to ultraviolet radiation (Zhao et al. 2007) produce ROS thereby causing DNA damage. Photosensitive silver nanoparticles have been shown to break the double-stranded DNA upon exposure of to UV light (Badireddy et  al. 2007).

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), “risk is a measure of the probability that cause damage to life, health, property, and/or the environment.” Before assessing the biotic hazard, it is desirable to assess the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles. The various techniques for analysis and characterization of metallic nanoparticles include membrane filtration (Akthakul et al. 2005; Howell et al. 2006), size-exclusion chromatography (Wang et al. 2006), and photon correlation spectroscopy, used to determine the size and sometimes the shape of metallic nanoparticles (Chrastina and Schnitzer 2010). Additionally, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Jose-Yacaman et  al. 2001; Chrastina and Schnitzer 2010), the scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Rai et  al. 2009), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Viguie et al. 2007) are used to gather evidence about the configuration, arrangement, charges, and force of nanoparticles. The complex arrangement of crystal metallic nanoparticles can be resolved by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) techniques (Rai et  al. 2009). However, it is difficult to analyze the properties of nanoparticles because their concentration in the environment is below the detection limit and test samples also carry unwanted nanoparticles (Lead and Wilkinson 2006). After the analysis and characterization of metallic nanoparticles, standard toxicity tests on organisms are used to assess the impacts of nanoparticles. For aquatic threat evaluation, an algal growth inhibition assay is commonly used, and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata is an ideal organism for envisaging lethal threats to primary producers (Aruoja et al. 2009). Toxicological effects of metallic nanoparticles on diverse algal species, such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Navarro et  al. 2008; Chen et  al. 2012; Melegari et al. 2013), Desmodesmus subspicatus (Hartmann et al. 2010), Dunaliella tertiolecta, and Chlorella vulgaris (Oukarroum et al. 2012), have also been studied. Also, Vibrio fischeri, a naturally luminescent bacterium, is widely used for ecotoxicological studies, and the bacterial luminescence inhibition assay is economical and easy to perform (Mortimer et al. 2008). There are various aspects for understanding the risk assessment of nanoparticles, such as dose of nanoparticles, exposure time, and endpoint measurement. Furthermore, short- and long-term laboratory experiments and development of a coordinated approach are still needed for assessing the toxicity."

It was of thought that NPs could be used for boosting the agricultural economic growth in the near future (Sabourin and Ayande 2015). But, unregulated use of NPs has threw the ecosystems at the brink of risk caused by toxicity of these NPs (Hong et al. 2014). Although NPs have gained the rapid attention of plant scientists during the recent few years, their fates in relation to sustainable agriculture are still unexplored.\nDespite of achievements in the field of NPs in agronomy, their role is still in a topsy-turvy stage (Yang et al. 2017). Different types of plants behave NPs differently. Also, same plant behaves different NPs differently. The response of NPs on plants as well as microbes depends upon the nature and concentration of NPs, nature of coating material, nature of growth media, mode of application, part of the plants, and even stage of plant development (Yang et al. 2017). As most of the NPs are made up of heavy metals, their elevated concentration in the biological systems could be detrimental to both aboveground and belowground flora as well.\nYang et al. (2017) have concluded the interaction of NPs with plants and microbes in their review. They have discussed pros and cons of NPs in details. But unfortunately, no conclusion could be established about the effect of NPs on symbioses in plants. In this chapter, extensive literature mining has been carried out to collect all the reports on interactions where effects of NPs have been studied on plants in relation to the symbiotic bacteria and/or fungi. Although there are very limited reports on tripartite interaction, it has been tried to find out the nature of interaction. Also, the possible mechanism behind these interactions is elucidated with the help of artwork.

More often, after continuous absorption, nutrient and water adjacent to the root systems get depleted. Because of the limited growth of roots, they cannot extract their need from soil from farther distance. In such conditions it is arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and other microbes play key roles in the survival of plants (Zoomi et al. 2017; Kehri et al. 2018).

McKee and Filser (2016) summarized the morphological nature of bacteria with reference to the NPs. In most of the reports, they have found gramnegative bacteria as less sensitive than gram-positive bacteria. However, any general conclusion could not be drawn. Further, toxicity may be related to specific nanoscale properties of the NPs.\nMcKee and Filser (2016) concluded that Ag- and Cu-based NPs exhibit antimicrobial activities. Suresh et al.

CuO and Fe2O3 NPs were reported as potentially harmful to soil environment (Frenk et al. 2013). Besides the negative effects, NPs were also reported to pose positive effects on soil microorganisms. 1.0 g/l citrate-coated Ag NPs (c-Ag NPs) enhanced the growth of Bacillus subtilis by 127 ± 23% (Doody et al. 2014).

Under low phosphorus condition, AM fungi reduced translocation, uptake, and accumulation of Zn (Jing et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2014, 2018) in plant. AM fungimediated reduction in the soil pH is responsible for decreased Zn bioavailability (Jing et al. 2016). Further, under low phosphorus conditions, AM fungi reduce the translocation and accumulation of Zn released from Zn NP (Jing et al. 2016). AM fungi secrete a group of glycoproteins called glomalin-related soil proteins (GRSPs) in the soil. GRSPs bind ZnO NP in the soil (Ghasemi Siani et al. 2017), making them immobilized. The efficiency of AM fungi is further increased under organic phosphorus (Wang et al. 2018) and low phosphorus conditions (Jing et al. 2016). Under low phosphorus condition, the efficiency of AM fungi is at maximum. High level of phosphorus in the soil inhibits the AM colonization, as plants get adequate phosphorus and the mutualism starts shifting toward parasitism. Under ZnSO4\nO. Akhtar et al.\n59\ntreatment the efficiency of AM fungi becomes more responsive toward the ZnO NP (Li et al. 2015). It is because AM fungi perceive heavy metal toxicity more quickly. Other mechanism of amelioration of ZnO NP toxicity in plants is the AM fungimediated increase in the accumulation of P, N, K, Fe, and Cu (Wang et al. 2014, 2016, 2018; Jing et  al. 2016). Decrease in ZnO NP toxicity was confirmed by reduced ROS production in AM fungi-colonized plants (Wang et al. 2016).\nZnO NPs enhance the growth performance in plants inhabited by non-AM symbiotic microbes (Medina-Velo et al. 2017; Singhal et al. 2017; Bandyopadhyay et al. 2015). ZnO nanorods stimulate the number of fungal pellets, spore size, early sporulation, and thick hyphae in Piriformospora indica. This caused increased crop productivity (Singhal et al. 2017). ZnO NPs increased the growth performance in leguminous plants by accumulation of essential elements – sulfur and magnesium – assisted by higher nodule formation in the roots.\nContrary to above findings, ZnO NPs were found bactericidal to Sinorhizobium meliloti (Bandyopadhyay et  al. 2012). However, it is less toxic than ZnCl2 for Medicago sativa L.  – Sinorhizobium meliloti association (Bandyopadhyay et  al. 2015). Ultra-high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that ZnO NPs were accumulated on the bacterial cell wall and internalized into the periplasmic space. ZnO NPs also altered the polysaccharide structures of extracellular polymeric substances on bacterial cell wall (Bandyopadhyay et  al. 2012). ZnO NPs also reduced the root shoot biomass (Bandyopadhyay et al. 2015)."

Higher concentration of NPs reduces AM colonization, soil GRSP content, and alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig. 4.1a). This decreases the availability of P nutrition in plants (Fig. 4.1a).

AM fungi have more than one mechanism through which they dilute the NP toxicity in host plants (Fig. 4.1b). These include (1) immobilization and, hence, reduced accumulation of heavy metallic NP by secretion of GRSPs, (2) reduction in NP accumulation by altering the soil pH and production of more DOC, (3) accumulation of more nutrient resulting in more biomass accumulation, and (4) reduction in reactive oxygen species in plants (Fig. 4.1b).\nBesides the negative roles, regulated dose of NPs has positive roles in plants, especially those inhabited by endophytic microbes and/or nitrogen fixers. The interaction among non-AM symbionts, NPs, and plants is also poorly understood. However, based on researches carried out, several conclusions could be drawn. Accordingly, NPs stimulate the plant growth by (1) increased accumulation of essential elements – sulfur and magnesium – assisted by higher nodule formation in the roots; (2) stimulation in the number of fungal pellets, spore size, early sporulation, and thick hyphae in endophytes; and (3) increasing the total bacteria, nitrogen fixer, and phosphate solubilizer count.\nO.

Nanoparticles (NPs) are very tiny particles, defined as the 10−9 part of 1 m (1 m−9) (Huang et al. 2015). NP efficiency relies on their surface area, size, composition, shape, and above all the effective concentration at which they work efficiently (Khodakovskaya et  al. 2012; Ranjan et  al. 2014;\nM.

Nanotechnology provides a very large variety of techniques and devices to formulate NPs, detect biotic and abiotic stress in plants, and provide genetic manipulation that allows more precise plant breeding (Perez-de-Luque and Hermosin 2013; Fraceto et  al. 2016). Fertilizers are very important in the growth, development, and metabolism of plants (Giraldo et al. 2014), but at most concentrations applied fertilizers are not available to plants because of leaching, runoff, and degradation. Thus, it is very important to control or minimize chemical fertilizer loss. With their unique properties, NPs encapsulate nutrients, which, released as required, control the discharge of chemical fertilizers for plant growth (Derosa et al. 2010; Nair et al. 2010; Shweta et al. 2018). Several studies have shown that particular low doses of NPs enhance plant physiology (Zheng et al. 2005; Klaine et al. 2008). NPs can enter plant cells through the stomata of leaves and roots to transport nutrients, DNA, and chemicals (Galbraith 2007; Torney et  al. 2007). Nanomaterials can break down the plasma membrane, inducing pore formation to enter into the plant cells (Wong et al. 2016) and reach the cytosol (Serag et al. 2011). These NPs enhance chlorophyll activity, water uptake, and specific microbial communities in the soil (Fig. 5.1).\nWith unique physicochemical properties, NPs can enhance the biochemical processes of plants (Giraldo et al. 2014). The application of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to activate the growth and physiology of different plants has been well documented;\nM. Nafees et al.\n67\nfor example, the root growth of ryegrass, onion, and cucumber was increased by CNTs (Lin and Xing 2007; Canas et al. 2008; Shweta et al. 2017). NPs have some toxic effects on plants and other living organisms, but also increase the growth, physiology, and photosynthesis of plants.

Minerals such as nitrogen and phosphorus act as growth factors, regulating plant growth and also increasing crop productivity. Phosphorus fertilizer increases the availability of phosphorus in the soil and increases the uptake of phosphorus from the root surfaces. In phosphorus-solubilizing enzymes in which Zn is a cofactor, phosphatase and phytase enzyme activity was increased by 84–108%. ZnO NPs also enhanced root length, root volume, and the chlorophyll and protein content of the leaves in mung bean plants. ZnO NPs also maintained soil health by influencing the soil microbial community (Raliya et al. 2016).\nGermination of cucumber seed was enhanced by exposure to various concentrations of ZnO NPs (de la Rosa et al. 2013). ZnO NPs not only were absorbed by Vigna radiata and Cicer arietinum roots but also improved the length and biomass of the roots and shoots of these species (Mahajan et al. 2011). This NP also enhanced somatic embryogenesis by shoot regeneration, induced the synthesis of proline, and increased tolerance against stress by increasing the activity of different enzymes (Helaly et  al. 2014). Gold (Au) NPs enhanced the seed germination of Brassica juncea, Boswellia ovalifoliolata, and Gloriosa superba (Arora et al. 2012; Gopinath et al. 2014). The Au NPs increased the number of leaves, leaf area, and length of the plant and its chlorophyll and carbohydrate content, which increased growth, development, and crop yield (Arora et al. 2012; Gopinath et al. 2014). The Au NPs demonstrated importance in seed germination, in antioxidants, and altered the expression of micro-RNAs that regulate morphological, physiological, and metabolic processes in plants (Kumar et al. 2013).\nThe effects of CeO2 were collectively found on seed germination, vegetative parts, the cotyledon, floral parts, and ripening of fruits. The rate of seed germination (97%) was high in a 10 mg/l concentration of CeO2. No negative effect on germination and no significant effect on production of chlorophyll was seen with any concentration of CeO2 NPs on tomato plants, although there was a significant difference in the growth of the vegetative parts of the tomato plant; faster growth was found at 10 mg/l CeO2 NPs. The number of floral buds was slightly higher in the control and the 10 mg/l concentration of CeO2 NPs, and 67% of buds were converted into the flower. Fruit size, production, and ripening were enhanced by increasing concentrations of CeO2 NPs; large, heavy fruits were found at 10 mg/l (Wang et al. 2012a).\n5 Effect of Nanoparticles on Plant Growth and Physiology and on Soil Microbes\n68\nM.

SiO2 NPs showed a negative correlation between NP concentration and relative water content (RWC) in plants. The RWC was decreased as the concentration of SiO2 increased from 0 to 4000 mg/l. It was observed that SiO2 NPs had a significant effect on photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, b, and carotenoids), which increased at 400–4000 mg/l NP concentration in Z. mays. High photosynthetic content was found at 400 mg/l SiO2 NPs (Rad et al. 2014)."

TiO2 also improved fixation of CO2, prevented the plant from aging, and ultimately enhanced the photosynthesis process (Hong et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2006).\nTiO2 NPs increased CO2 fixation by increasing the activity of rubisco and ultimately improving plant growth.

      "text" : "Carbon nanotubes are allotropic forms of carbon nanoparticles, open or closed nano-structure cylindrical tubes that are single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) or multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs). These layers are composed of rolled sheets of graphene. These nanotubes vary from 100  nm to some centimeters in length; the outer diameter of SWCNTs varies from 0.8 to 2 nm and that of MWCNTs from 5 to 20 nm (De Volder et al. 2013). CNTs were shown to act as growth regulators for plants (Khot et al. 2012). It was also noted that different sizes and composition of CNTs affect different plant growth parameters (Table 5.3). The stress-related gene of the tomato seed was regulated by MWCNTs that enhance seed germination and growth (Khodakovskaya et al. 2009).\nCNTs are involved in major cellular processes of plants such as up- or downregulation of gene expression. MWCNTs induced the expression of a gene that codes for water channels and increased the water intake ability of root cells. CNTs are very small in diameter, so they can easily pass through the pores of the cell wall and also can increase the cell-wall pores. CNTs induced pores in the cell wall that enhanced water uptake, which regulates the activity of starch hydrolase enzymes and increases seed germination (Santos et al. 2013; Vithanage et al. 2017). These CNTs also act as a slow-release fertilizer that promotes plant growth (Wu 2013).\nMWCNTs are also frequently used in hydroponic culture; CNTs (2000 mg/l) increase the root length of ryegrass (Lin and Xing 2007). Canas et al. (2008) showed that CNTs enhanced the physiology of six crops: cucumber, carrot, onion, tomato, cabbage, and lettuce. Plants were treated with uncoated (0, 104, 315, or 1750 mg/l) or coated (0, 160, 900, or 5000 mg/l) CNTs for 48 h. The uncoated CNTs significantly boosted root length of onion and cucumber more than the coated CNTs, with an inverse proportion between time and root elongation in these hydroponic crops. More effective results were seen on the first day as compared to the second day. It was hypothesized that CNTs may have an obligatory effect on the root length of plants by obstructing the relationship between roots and microbes, altering vital biological and chemical reactions. CNTs not only were absorbed by the plant but accumulated in the epidermal tissue of wheat roots (Wild and Jones 2009). Citratecoated CNTs enhanced the growth and physiology of plants by increasing water uptake capability and also the uptake of nutrients and minerals, which directly affected the photosynthesis of the plants. CNTs increased plant length and also increased the number of leaves, which enhanced plant photosynthetic activity (Tripathi et al. 2011).\nMWCNTs regulated the gene expression of the aquaporin gene (NtPIPI), and of two water channel genes (CycB and NtLRX), which increased cell permeability for water absorption and also helped in formation of the cell wall and regulation of mitosis (Khodakovskaya et al. 2012). MWCNTs also had a significant effect on root\nM. Nafees et al.\n73\n5 Effect of Nanoparticles on Plant Growth and Physiology and on Soil Microbes\n74\nlength of wheat seedlings, and on germination and growth of soya bean, corn, and barley (Wang et al. 2012a, b; Lahiani et al. 2013). The root length of wheat seedlings increased 32% with MWCNTs at 40–160 μg/l for 3 to 7 days (Wang et al. 2012a, b). CNTs impacted early plant growth by germination of seed, expression of genes, cell culturing, and physiological processes such as photosynthesis and antioxidant activities (Canas et al. 2008).\nSWCNTs enhanced photosynthetic activity threefold as compared to normal photosynthesis, and increased the rate of electron transport because SWCNTs combine with the chloroplast and enable the leaf to enhance the rate of electron transport by a photo-absorption mechanism (Giraldo et al. 2014). The germination ability of seed might be enhanced by increasing concentrations of MWCNTs. The highest seed germination rate was noted at 60 μg/ml CNTs; increasing CNT concentrations increased plant growth and also enhanced the yield of cotton per plant. The highest yield of cotton was found at 100 μg/ml CNTs (Sawant 2016): there was a linear correlation between seed germination and CNT concentration. It was observed that the length of plants (62 ± 5.58cm), boll’ number/ plant (5.8 ± 0.64) and size of boll (3.41 ± 0.27cm) and yield of cotton (3.4 ± 0.37/hectare) was found highest at 120 μg/ml, 80 μg/ml, 60 μg/ml, 100 μg/ml of CNTs respectively (Sawant 2016).\nVarious studies have shown that SWCNTs and MWCNTs positively affect germination and growth of tomato, rice, common gram, and tobacco by increasing their water uptake ability, which improves germination processes (Khodakovskaya et al. 2009; Nair 2016). The toxic levels of Ag, ZnO, and Al2O3 induced oxidative stress and produced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which reduced plant growth (Zhao et al. 2012; Thwala et al. 2013; Hossain et al. 2015; Xia et al. 2015). Oxidative species reduced rubisco activity and decreased the photo-protective activity of photosystem II (Jiang et al. 2017). The defensive system of plant consists of nonenzymatic antioxidants, which include thiols, glutathione, phenolics, ascorbate and enzymatic CAT, SOD, APX, GR, GPX, and GST (Singh et  al. 2015). Oxidative stresses were caused by NPs that decreased photosynthetic rate, ultimately inhibiting plant growth (Da Costa and Sharma 2016; Li et al. 2016).\nChegini et al. (2017) observed that physiological parameters were affected by MWCNTs, drought conditions, and their interactions in Salvia mirzayanii. The leaf water content and chlorophyll index showed significant alterations under drought conditions. The various levels of MWCNTs affected electrolyte leakage index and caused a significant difference in phenolic compounds under the interactions of the experimental treatments. Phenolic content was significantly influenced at MWCNT 50 and 200 mg/l, to 25% of field capacity (FC), respectively. The concentration of MWCNTs (50 mg/l) in moderate drought condition changed the physiological traits and antioxidant activity of S. mirzayanii.\nBarbinta-Patrascu et  al. (2017) reported an effect of carbon nanotubes coated with chlorophyll a and laden biomimetic membrane. The multilamellar lipid vesicles increased antioxidant (85%) activity and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, and the highest antioxidant ability was found in hybrid CNTs that originated through the multilamellar lipid vesicles (TP3). They were\nM. Nafees et al.\n75\nwidely dispersed and increased the reaction sites for removal of ROS by increasing their surface area. The TP3 sample showed the highest antibacterial activity resulting from good dispersion because a large surface area was provided to destroy bacterial contamination. The SWCNTs react directly with bacterial cells and physically break down their cell membrane by puncture, causing the death of the bacterial cells (S. aureus) (Bai et al. 2011; Smith and Rodrigues 2015)."

      "text" : "Sunlight is the most available source of energy, which is conserved in many ways in an ecosystem. One of the most efficient methods for the conservation of sunlight is photosynthesis. For this purpose, the higher green plants, algae, and bacteria contain special pigments that use water and CO2 to form organic molecules. These photosynthetic organisms contain the photo-elements chlorophyll a, b, d, and f, and a series of electron carrier redox reactions (Blankenship et al. 2011). The thylakoid membrane of plastids acts as a photo-current producer in the presence of potassium ferrocyanide. The cell surface (1 cm2) produced maximum electric power, 24 mW, at 625 nm of red light. The thylakoid membrane immobilized with MWCNTs acts as an anode with MWCNTs as a cathode, which produced the maximum current density, 38 mA/cm2. The maximum electric power produced at this current density is 5.3 mW/cm2 (Calkins et al. 2013). The effect of CNTs on chlorophyll f and d was more than that on chlorophyll a and b: it enhanced the absorption ability of far-red and infrared light (700–750 nm) and also enhanced the ability of photo-convertors (Voloshin et al. 2015). The CNTs were synthetic NPs that penetrate into the biological matrix and have multifunctional properties such as water uptake and conduction for electricity in biological systems. MWCNTs were most electro-conductive in BY-2 tobacco cells as compared to balsam fir wood at high temperature (Di Giacomo et al. 2013; Leslie et al. 2014).\nIt was investigated whether CNTs had a positive effect on photosystem I of cyanobacteria by enhancing the ability of conversion of light into current. The MWCNTs were non-encroaching because a carboxylate pyrene derivative formed the fixed covalent structure of photosystem I (PS I). The PS I was ascribed as the transporter of photo-current to the electrode (MWCNTs) (Ciornii et  al. 2017). MWCNTs have a combined effect on thylakoid, the multi-protein complexes PS I and II, and photo-electrochemical properties. SWCNTs enhanced immobilization of the reaction center of the bacterium Rhodobacter (Rb.) sphaeroides (sp.) and also enhanced the photo-electrochemical activity (Ham et al. 2010; Calkins et al. 2013). MWCNTs significantly enhanced direct transfer of electron in the thylakoid of spinach and of the cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. (Sekar et al. 2014). CNTs enhanced the expression of Arabidopsis aquaporin in tobacco plant and enhanced photosynthetic activity by production of the photo-electric current. It was observed that CNTs activate gene and protein expression of aquaporin in tobacco cells (Khodakovskaya et al. 2012).\n5 Effect of Nanoparticles on Plant Growth and Physiology and on Soil Microbes\n76"

Microorganisms have a key role in recycling of nutrients by decomposition of organic matter (Simonet and Valcarcel 2009; Dinesh et al. 2012). Some microorganisms associate with plant roots; the soil microbial community normally consists of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi (Luongo and Zhang 2010; Santos et al. 2013). The major challenge in the agriculture sector is the conservation of biodiversity and protection of the biomass of these soil microbes. CNTs can change a microbial community by increasing or decreasing the toxins present in organic compounds (Dinesh et  al. 2012). Limited literature is available on the impact of CNTs on soil microbial communities. It has been also reported that CNTs had no significant effect on soil microbes. So, there is a need to thoroughly explore CNT impacts on soil microbes.\nMukherjee et al. (2016) reported that low and high concentrations of CNTs have no adverse effect on soil microbiota. High (10–10,000 mg/kg) and low (10–1,000 mg/ ml) concentrations of CNTs were used to investigate effects on soil microbial community and enzymatic activity, but it was found that CNTs had no visible effect on soil microbes and enzymatic activity, although these high and low CNT concentrations reduced selected species of bacteria. These specific concentrations increased the amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-degrading bacteria. Similarly, when red clover was treated with MWCNTs, the activity of symbiotic microorganisms as nitrogen fixers was slightly increased at 3000 mg/kg MWCNTs (Moll et al. 2016).\nM. Nafees et al.\n77"

There is an urgent need to utilize NPs having great potential to enhance photosynthesis mechanism because minimal attention is being given to this area of research. Biosynthesized NPs should be used: by controlling their size and concentration we can determine the mechanism of toxicity in plants. Modulating these factors, we can reduce transportation, toxicity, and bioavailability to the ecosystem. There is further need to explore the function of NPs beneath plant roots."

However, Professor Norio Taniguchi initially introduced the multidisciplinary science in the year 1974 that covers research as well as technology from chemistry and physics together with biology usually called nanotechnology (Haleemkhan et  al. 2015). Nanotechnology has emerged as one of the important areas of contemporary science that deals with methodology, fabrication, as well as tailoring of materials’ size within 1–100 nm range. In such range, the entire properties of individual atoms or molecules along with their corresponding bulk counterparts undergo drastic transformation that gives rise to a wide range of interesting novel and astonishing physicochemical properties based on their morphology, size, as well as size distribution\nS.

(Miller) Senior Secondary School, Bihar, Patna, India\n88\n(Baker et al. 2013; Ahmed et al. 2016). This is attributable to fact that when the materials’ size reaches to nanoscale, the % atoms existing at the surface of material turn out to be substantial, where the greater surface area of nanomaterials (NMs) results, the role played by small bulk of material (Akhtar et al. 2013). The NMs depict exceptional features owing to their high surface energy, large fraction of surface atoms, diminished imperfections, as well as spatial confinement (Bai et  al. 2009). Apart from this, NMs are advantageous compared to corresponding bulk counterparts because of their surface-enhanced Raman scattering, surface plasmon resonance, surface-enhanced Rayleigh scattering, and surface plasmon light scattering properties. Owing to such possessions, NMs could be exploited as building blocks toward many optoelectronic, electronic, chemical sensing, and biological applications (Wong and Schwaneberg 2003; Ramanavicius et al. 2005; Singh et al. 2018a, b; Pandey et al. 2018).\nA noteworthy field of research in nanotechnology is the fabrication of NMs having distinct shapes as well as sizes and chemical structures including regulated disparities. Since the past two decades, the formation of noble metallic NMs (silver, gold, platinum, and palladium) has been gaining substantial interest owing to a wide range of potential uses like shampoos, detergents, cosmetic products, toothpaste, etc. (Kim and Song 2010). Table 6.1 summarizes the potential uses of silver, gold, platinum, and palladium as noble metallic NMs. Such valuable metallic NMs are produced as a result of either top to bottom or bottom to up techniques. Figure 6.1 summarizes the top to bottom and bottom to up approaches for the fabrication of metallic NMs. In top to bottom strategy, production of metal NMs is carried out as a reduction of appropriate bulk compounds into nano-size by employing different physical/chemical approaches (Mittal et  al. 2013). In this method,\nS. P. Singh et al.\n89\noutwardly precise apparatuses are employed so as to cut and mill for shaping the substances to anticipated order. Many physical fabrication approaches such as lithography, pyrolysis, thermolysis, etc., are included in this group (Li et al. 1999; Tsai et al. 2004; Shubin et al. 2012). The main limitation associated with top to down method is the inadequacy of the surface assembly of metal NMs that exhibit a substantial impact upon their physical as well as surface chemistry characteristics (Treguer et  al. 1998). Additional drawback involves requirement of mammoth energy for maintaining the high magnitude of pressure and temperature during such fabrication process (Li et al. 1999; Treguer et al. 1998). However, the bottom\n6 Recent Trends and Advancement Toward Phyto-mediated Fabrication of Noble…\n90\nto top technique involves the fabrication of metallic NMs primarily because of gathering of the atoms/molecules or the bunches (Thakkar et al. 2010). Such primarily produced metallic NMs then consequently undergo clustering, which lead to ultimate material by means of chemical/green chemistry approaches. This technique facilitates to achieve cost- effective metal NMs having lower surface imperfection with more homogeneous chemical composition. This method is normally exploited toward wet fabrication processes such as chemical, electrochemical, sonochemical, and polyol reduction. Remarkably, these wet fabrication processes are shown to be economical toward bulk production of NMs. Nevertheless, these approaches are also found to depict limitations like wide exploitation of toxic compounds, nonpolar organic solvents, and many stabilizing as well as nonnatural capping agents, thereby preventing their uses in the clinical as well as biomedical field. In addition, the chemically synthesized NMs by this approach led to severe environmental problems including biological systems (Xiong et  al. 2005; Nemamcha et al. 2006; Pritchard et al. 2010; Gangula et al. 2011; Yang et al. 2013; Mizukoshi et al. 2010; Devi et al. 2016). Considering these, there is a need to introduce green chemistry strategy as simple, comparatively reproducible, and ecofriendly alternative over fabrication of NMs. The green chemistry encompasses the exploitation of a set of ideologies that decrease or get rid of the use/formation of detrimental substances in the design, production, as well as application of chemical products. Greener fabrication of NMs exhibits improvement as compared to physical/chemical approaches for being eco-friendly, simple, eye-catching, inexpensive, as well as comparatively reproducible. It has the ability to often produce more stable NMs. In this route, the biomolecules like proteins, terpenes, metabolites, etc., of biological systems play a role as reducing, capping, as well as stabilizing agents toward the fabrication of NMs with discrete shape and size. A critical review of the literature reveals that several biological systems like microorganisms and plants including human cells can translate metallic ions into metal or metal oxide NMs (Patete et  al. 2011; Makarov et  al. 2014; Mohammadinejad et  al. 2016). Among biological systems, microbes like bacterial, cyanobacterial, fungal, and viral species/strains including actinomycetes are recognized as potential platform for the fabrication of metallic NMs either intra- or extracellularly (Narayanan and Sakthivel 2010). The microbe-based NM production rate is sluggish and results in merely restricted number of sizes as well as shapes over plant- based substances. In this context, binary function of phytochemicals as reducing and stabilizing agents (inexpensive), easy accessibility, the economical cultivation, simple process with requirement of normal pressure as well as temperature (economical), lack of complex as well as multistage processes such as isolation of microbes, culturing, maintenance, etc., biocompatibility of plant extracts (appropriate toward medicinal application), lesser or no contamination (environmental friendly along with safe toward human therapeutic application), and faster fabrication of NMs together with the ability to easily scale up bulk production of NMs make plant systems as eye-catching route for the NM fabrication together with metal/metal oxide over other biological systems (Shankar et al. 2004a; Iravani 2011; Dhillon et al. 2012; Dauthal and Mukhopadhyay 2016; Mohammadinejad et  al. 2016). Overall, the\nS. P. Singh et al.\n91\npotential of plant system as bio-factory for the production of NMs is not only an underexplored but also a profitable strategy (Harris and Bali 2008; Thakkar et al. 2010; Iravani 2011). Furthermore, plant system is found to be rich in a wide variety of phytochemicals/biomolecules. Nevertheless, their potential is yet to be completely exploited under full control for fabricating NMs. Interestingly, it is feasible for the fabrication of metallic NMs at commercial level with the help of plant tissue culture methodologies coupled with optimizing the downstream processing (Jha et al. 2009). This chapter provides an insight toward the recent trends and advances of phyto-mediated synthesis of noble metallic NMs (silver, gold, platinum, and palladium)."

The foremost limitation of intracellular approach involves the dissimilarities in reducing as well as stabilizing the ability of phytochemicals/biomolecules present in various portions of plant system, which leads to the production of extremely polydisperse metallic NMs of varied morphologies. Also, the tedious recovery of metallic NMs from plant biomass along with little commercial feasibility of plant biomass-mediated fabrication of metallic NMs has diminished the potential of this route.\nIn contrast, the extracellular fabrication of metallic NMs turns out to be an attractive strategy owing to effortless downstream processing as well as scaling up. The extracellular approach of metallic NM fabrication employing plant extracts is more common than intracellular approach because of its potential in various commercial\n6 Recent Trends and Advancement Toward Phyto-mediated Fabrication of Noble…\n92\nuses. Usually, the exploitation of plant extract is found to assist the formation of NMs with highly energetic favorable spherical shape as well as more reactive fcc structure. Interestingly, the spherical shape and desired growth together with (111) plane facilitate the reactivity of NMs toward many industrial uses. This fact advocates that plant extract-based reduction is a regulated equilibrium process, which controls the formation of NMs up to particular shape as well as structure, thereby revealing the significance of this route. Nevertheless, it is extremely challenging to reproduce metallic NMs having monodispersity with definite surface morphology because of definitely varying phytochemical components along with structure of\nS. P. Singh et al.\n93\nplants from diverse origins (Ahmed et  al. 2014). Besides, there is often more possibility for the presence of contaminations with plant biomasses/agricultural wastes. Thus, it is extremely problematic for the synthesis of metallic NMs having desired size as well as morphology. However, such desired metallic NMs could be fabricated merely as a result of exploitation of particular phytochemical/biomolecule derived from specific portion of plant biomass/living plants. This must be followed when the focus is to fabricate metallic NMs with high monodispersity as well as desired surface morphology. Several investigators have found the biosynthesis of metallic NMs using plant extracts with their promising uses in various fields (Niraimathi et al. 2013; Seralathan et al. 2014).\nThe fabrication of metallic NMs using plant extract is linked with the issue of varied phytochemical composition (Ahmed et al. 2014). As a result, it is extremely challenging to forecast the precise mechanism of metallic NM production employing plant extracts. Nevertheless, there are few investigations which forecasted the function of polyphenols as well as flavonoids toward the formation and stabilization of metallic NMs (Basha et al. 2010; Tamuly et al. 2014). Considering this, it is essential to recognize the exact phytoconstituents accountable toward production of NM. Therefore, investigators are concentrating on the isolation of specific antioxidant phytoconstituents for formation of metallic NMs. To date, merely limited studies have been carried out concerning phytoconstituents that are straightforwardly exploited toward the production of metallic NMs (Kasthuri et al. 2009a, b; Basha et al. 2010; Safaepour et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2010; Govindaraju et al. 2011; Leonard et al. 2011; Ahmed et al. 2014; Durai et al. 2014; Iram et al. 2014; Tamuly et al. 2014)."

For instance, Shankar et  al.

Shankar et al. (2004b) also successfully carried out the phyto- fabrication of triangular gold nanoprisms as a result of reaction between lemongrass leaf extract and aqueous AuCl4− ions.

It makes up our surroundings along with all the nonliving and living things like the water covering most of the earth’s surface, the air we breathe, the soil, the animals and plants near us, the insects, and much more. Living things such as human beings constantly interact with each other and with their environment and try to adapt themselves as per its conditions in order to survive, forming an ecosystem  – a functional unit of environment (Health & Science 2011). Since several years, scientists have been carefully analyzing this interaction and examining the different ways in which the humans affect their environment. Human beings are playing with natural environment to make their own lives’ comfortable. As we know, every coin has two sides, and a rose has also a thorn: the same is true with modernization. There is no doubt that modern techniques play a significant role in making humans’ lives easy, but they are also associated with major drawbacks that affect our environment badly. Scientists have observed increasing cases of air and water pollution, acid rains, deforestation, change in climate such as global warming, and many other problems which are dangerous not only to the earth but also to ourselves (Fact Monster 2017). Figure 7.1 shows the effect of human activities on the environment.

Global management of environment firstly requires the thorough investigation of various pollutants that are contaminating the air, water, food, soil, etc., which ultimately pose greater ecological threats, and then to find and adopt ways to eliminate these pollutants completely in the environment (Koedrith et al. 2015). Air pollutants originate from various sources such as power plants, refineries, laboratory and industrial processes, vehicle emissions, etc. Sulfur and nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, etc. are some of the major air contaminants. Water and soil pollutants are generally categorized as either radioactive elements (such as tritium), or microbiological (such as coliform) or inorganic compounds (like arsenic), or synthetic organic elements (like pesticides, herbicides, weedicides, etc.). Some volatile organic compounds like benzene also contribute in increasing water and soil pollution. Nowadays, food safety and biothreats are other major concerns gaining much attention (Singh 2017). Figure 7.2 specifies the various ways needed to be adopted in order to deal with these several environmental contaminants.\nStrict regulations have been imposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) on the concentrations of various air and water contaminants present in the environment. However, traditional detection and monitoring techniques (like different chromatographic techniques (Justino et al. 2017; Lang et al. 2016;\nS. Gupta and V. Kakkar\n109\nHassani et  al. 2017) are complex, time-intensive, and costly and require skilled labor and proper laboratory facilities with existing limitations in analytical and sampling methods (Ho et  al. 2005; Looney and Falta 2000; Koedrith et  al. 2015). Moreover, these conventional techniques also lack the efficiency when used for in situ measurements essential in emergency situations such as in the cases of acute poisoning, epidemics, or accidental release of biothreats or pesticides (Arduini et al. 2013; Guo et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2014). Thus, in order to overcome the magnification of various environmental issues, there is urgent need of highly sensitive, rapid, cost-effective, miniaturized, portable, and easy-to-operate techniques and devices that can detect and monitor various contaminants responsible for the destruction of ecosystem (Zhang et al. 2014; Guo et al. 2017; Arduini et al. 2013). Advancements in nanotechnology and biosensing techniques have made it possible to design such devices that can achieve all the aforesaid objectives. The analytical performance such as limit of detection, sensitivity, and specificity, especially for in situ applications, has been improved to a greater extent with the development of smart and rapid biosensors employing various nanocomposites or nanomaterials to detect distinct environmental pollutants (Maduraiveeran and Jin 2017; Zhao et al. 2013).\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter describe the various available biosensing techniques and explore their potential for the monitoring and detection of environmental pollutants.\n7 Development of Environmental Biosensors for Detection, Monitoring, and Assessment\n110"

This process allows the detection of substrates, products, inhibitors, and modulators of the catalytic reaction. Such biosensors can operate in either direct mode or indirect mode. Direct mode involves the monitoring of concentrations of analytes and products formed during enzymatic reactions, whereas indirect mode monitors the enzyme inhibition by the analyte (Nigam and Shukla 2015; Rebollar-Pérez et al. 2016). For the detection of various environmental pollutants, indirect mode is more favorable. For the successful biosensor design, immobilization of enzyme on the solid surface is one of the crucial steps. Immobilized enzymatic biosensors are more advantageous in comparison with the free enzyme-based sensors as they are rapid, require minimal amounts of sample, and are more sensitive as interference by the differential mode is less in these biosensors (Vargas-Bernal et al. 2012; Nigam and Shukla 2015).\nWhole-Cell Based Biosensors\nWhole cells (fungi, yeast, bacteria, or eukaryotic cells) can also be used as biorecognition element as they are better sources of enzymatic activities than isolated enzymes (Salvador et al. 2007; Gutiérrez et al. 2015). Whole-cell-based biosensors, like yeast biosensors, microbial biosensors, etc. utilize the immobilization techniques in order to immobilize the cells on transducer electrode. Such sensors are useful especially when detection of noncommercially available or expensive enzymes is needed (Ahmed et al. 2014; Hashemi Goradel et al. 2018).\nGenosensors\nIn these types of biosensors, bio-recognition component is a class of small biomolecules or biopolymers known as nucleic acids. Nucleic acids include DNA and RNA which are very large and complex forms of organic molecules and contain the genetic information and code of an organism. These are composed of nucleotides and are essential to all known forms of life (Antonio Blanco 2017). The working of DNA-based biosensors relies on the principle of hybridization of complementary strands of DNA in a highly specific manner. Selection of probe and immobilization plays a significant role in the construction of a genosensor (Hashemi Goradel et al. 2018). Genosensors have a wide range of applications in various fields like in medical diagnostics for the detection of genetic diseases, in forensic medicine, in environmental monitoring to control food and water contamination, for the detection of various pathogens, and so on (Valle 2011; Orozco et al. 2016).\nS. Gupta and V. Kakkar\n113\nAptasensors\nAptasensors are also DNA-based sensors in which selected DNA plays the role of a highly specific receptor of chemical or biological species (Hashemi Goradel et al. 2018). Aptasensors use aptamer, an artificial nucleic acid ligand, as bio-recognition agent. Aptamers can be generated against proteins, amino acids, drugs, and other molecules (O’sullivan 2002). The utilization of aptamers in biosensors for the detection of biomolecules has many advantages when compared with the use of antibodies due to the chemical stability, cost-effectiveness, and smaller size of aptamers (Lim et al. 2010).\nGenosensors and aptasensors are the affinity-based DNA biosensors in which a DNA probe is used to capture an analyte or target. The other category of DNA biosensors based on the catalytic capability of DNA is termed as catalytic-based DNA biosensors. DNAzymes and aptazymes fall under this category of DNA-based biosensors (Hashemi Goradel et al. 2018). DNAzymes are not found in nature and are basically catalytically active DNA molecules that are obtained and isolated via in vitro selection (Zhou et al. 2017). Aptazymes are ligand-activated self-cleaving ribozymes containing integrated aptamer domains and generated by combining DNAzymes, used for chemically modifying nucleic acids, and aptamers, required for binding a broad range of molecules (Zhou et al. 2017; Tang et al. 2017; Hashemi Goradel et al. 2018).\nBiomimetic Biosensors\nIn these biosensors, non-biological receptors are used as bio-recognition element as these receptors have the capability of mimicking the behavior of natural biomolecules. Biomimetic biosensors can be used to analyze the sense of taste, an indispensable perception of human sensory organ. Sense of taste refers to the five basic tastes including bitterness, sourness, sweetness, umami, and saltiness (Lu et  al. 2017). These biosensors also find applications in medical diagnostics, in monitoring environment and food safety, etc. (Kozitsina et al. 2018; Huffman et al. 2017)."

      "text" : "The transducer is an imperative part of a biosensor since it is responsible for the conversion of a biological or biochemical response into an analyzable and measurable electrical signal. Selection of a transducer for a particular application is crucial because appropriate transducers have a dramatic role in providing the optimum detection with high sensitivity and specificity (Salvador et  al. 2007). Different transduction mechanisms are available for designing a biosensor, and according to these signal transduction principles, biosensors can be classified in the following ways:\n7 Development of Environmental Biosensors for Detection, Monitoring, and Assessment\n114\nElectrochemical Biosensors\nThe electrochemical transducers are one of the most developed biosensors available in the literature (Rebollar-Pérez et al. 2016). An electrochemical biosensor exploits the various physicochemical properties of electroactive substances and detects these properties in order to realize the bio-recognition so as to provide a measurable signal such as electrical voltage, current, impedance, or superficial charge (VargasBernal et  al. 2012). Depending on the measured electrical signal and mode of electrical measurement, electrochemical biosensors can be subdivided into different categories such as potentiometric (measurement of voltage), amperometric (measurement of current), chronoamperometric, conductometric, impedimetric (resistive, capacitative), coulometric, and field-effect transistors (Vargas-Bernal et  al."

      "text" : "In chronoamperometric transduction technique, the working electrode potential is stepped which produces the current as a function of time by using faradaic processes. This technique is useful for analyzing the kinetics of chemical reactions, for monitoring the adsorption and diffusion processes, and for measuring protein and protease activity (El Harrad and Amine 2017). Conductometric technique depends on the current produced by ions in solution, while impedimetric transduction refers to the measurement of impedance (voltage as a function of the current). The performance of both these biosensing methods is highly influenced by a sensing layer placed between the two electrodes (Salvador et al. 2007). Field-Effect Transistor (FET) based Biosensor mechanism is based on the measurement of current which is varied due to the potentiometric effect at a gate electrode (Guiseppi-Elie and Lingerfelt 2005). Coulometric biosensing principle is based on the exhaustive electrolysis of analyte by which we can determine the unknown analyte concentration in a solution. This is done by converting the analyte completely from one oxidation state to another (Chemicool Dictionary 2017; David Harvey 2019).\nOptical Biosensors\nOptical biosensors rely on the principle of detecting the alterations in various optical properties such as adsorption, reflectance, refractive index, scattering of light, absorbance, luminescence (bioluminescence, chemiluminescence), fluorescence, etc. (Mishra et al. 2017). Optical techniques can be used for the quantification of an optical spectrum and for interpreting the changes in a mechanical measure and are required for overall biological or chemical analysis (Fortin 2009). The detection of analyte is usually done by employing electromagnetic radiations, like ultraviolet (UV), infrared (IR), or other radiations (Hashemi Goradel et al. 2018).\nS. Gupta and V. Kakkar\n115\nPiezoelectric Biosensors\nPiezoelectricity is an electrical effect caused by the variations in the material strain (Fortin 2009). Piezoelectric biosensors are sensitive to changes in density, mass, or viscosity of samples in the vicinity of its active surface (Hashemi Goradel et  al. 2018). Acoustic wave biosensors employ the piezoelectric transduction mechanism for the detection of biomolecules. Such sensors are based on an oscillating crystal resonating at the fundamental frequency. The bio-recognition element needed to interact selectively with the target analyte is coated as a layer on the crystal element, and when the binding of analyte on sensing surface takes place, the mass of crystal changes which eventually changes the resonance frequency (Monošík et al. 2012). Such biosensors are easy to operate and offer label-free on-line analysis at affordable costs. Cantilever biosensors are the other emerging class of mass-sensitive biosensors that can achieve lower limit of detections when compared with conventional methods (Salvador et al. 2007).\nThermometric Biosensors\nQuantification of the release of thermal energy or the evolution and absorption of heat during a biochemical reaction is the fundamental principle of thermometric biosensors (Monošík et al. 2012; Hashemi Goradel et al. 2018). In these biosensors, immobilized enzyme or cell is directly attached to a thermistor, and the resistance of transducer changes as a result of the temperature variations in reaction medium (Salvador et al. 2007; Monošík et al. 2012).\nMagnetic Biosensors\nMagnetic biosensors utilize magnetic particles (such as paramagnetic or superparamagnetic particles or crystals) for detecting biological interactions (Nabaei et al. 2018). The size of these particles ranges from micro- to nanometers, and their surfaces are modified and functionalized in order to recognize and identify specific biomolecules by measuring the variations in magnetic properties (magneto-optical properties, resistance, etc.) or by analyzing magnetically induced effects such as coil inductance alterations, Hall effect, giant magnetoresistance (GMR), etc. (Monošík et al. 2012; Li and Kosel 2013; Rife et al. 2003)."

Such pollutants in environment can be categorized into two groups: organic and inorganic compounds. Organic pollutants include pesticides, bisphenol A, surfactants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, hormones, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates, polychlorinated biphenyls, phenols, dioxins, antibiotics, alkanes, and toxins. Inorganic phosphates, metals, and nitrate are the types of inorganic pollutants. In recent years, various biosensors including genosensors, aptasensors, immunosensors, and enzymatic biosensors employing different transduction mechanisms (Monošík et al. 2012) as mentioned in the previous section have been reported for the monitoring and detection of several environmental pollutants (Rebollar-Pérez et al. 2016).

These pesticides are dangerous to health as they can cause respiratory and immunological problems, nervous system disorders, and even cancers due to their carcinogenic nature (Sassolas et al. 2012).

The metallic nanoparticles are becoming increasingly important due to their potential application in many fields. Thus using nanotechnology may extend service life, limit the potential for environmental damage, and reduce failure rates. The present chapter focuses on providing an overview and a discussion of metallic nanoparticle synthesis by various biological and non-biological ways. Therefore, a green, nontoxic way of synthesizing metallic nanoparticles is needed in order to allow them to be used in a wider range of industries. This could potentially be achieved by using biological methods. This review will focus on how material science and biology can work together to create a green way of synthesizing metal nanoparticles for a wide range of uses."

Since the early 19th century, plant extracts have been known to have the ability to reduce MNPs, but the mechanism involved was not well understood. Recently, in medical science, MNPs synthesized using green technology have attracted a great deal of interest. Magnetic nanoparticles synthesized using green technologies over chemical-based methods have several advantages, i.e., more eco-friendly, easily scaled up, cost-effective, and comparatively require\nS.

In the synthesis of MNPs, plant extracts may act as both stabilizing and reducing agents which directly influence the characteristics of nanoparticles (NPs). Different plant extracts contain different phytoconstituents like catechins, flavonoids, polyphenols, enzymes, alkaloids, vitamins, and functional groups, i.e., plant pigments, polysaccharide, tannins, which are responsible for bioreduction process of metal salts to MNPs. Bioreduction process typically involves simple mixing of aqueous extract with aqueous metallic salt solution, and reaction is carried out at room temperature. The biological synthesis of MNPs involves microorganisms and is considered as bottom-up approach. In this process nanoparticle formation occurs due to oxidation of metal ions occurs in presence of biomolecules i.e. sugars, enzymes, proteins secreted by microorganisms. However, the complete mechanism for synthesis of metallic nanoparticles is not well explored due to the fact that a different microorganism interacts differently with metal ions. Thus the formation of nanoparticles by biochemical processing,\n8 Nano-Based Materials and Their Synthesis\n130\nenvironmental factors, and its interaction ultimately determine the formation, size, and morphology of the nanoparticle."

      "text" : "The use of different parts of plant or plant extracts for synthesis of silver nanoparticles has drawn attention, due to its economical, rapid, eco-friendly, non- pathogenic, and a single step technique for the biosynthesis processes. The stabilization and reduction of silver metal ions by combination of biomolecules of plant extract, i.e., saponins, proteins, polysaccharides, amino acids, phenolics, enzymes, vitamins, tannins, terpenoids, and alkaloids, are already established to have medicinal values and are environmentally benign.\nVarious plant extracts are reported to facilitate synthesis of nanoparticles, as mentioned in Table  8.1. Various MNP types (of different metals) were achieved using GS methodology. This is an indication of high reducing potentials of plant phytochemicals that neutralize uni- or multivalent metallic cations (Mn+) into neutral atoms (Mo) for MNP synthesis. This might be due to the failure of the plant biomolecules to reduce metal cations with lower reduction potentials. Thus screening of plant biomolecules having high electron-donating capacity can be one of the efficient options for making GS a common modality of MNP synthesis. The innumerable angiospermic plant species are being used as remedies for diseases and also as a part of our diet. Therefore, during plant selection, important technical aspects, such as availability, socioeconomic importance, edibility, ethnobotanical background apart from the reducing nature of selected plant species.

Chaudhary et al.\n131\nto synthesized extra- and intracellular MNPs given in Table 8.2. A biological procedure for MNP synthesis has been informed using bacterial biomass, supernatant, and derived constituents. Among the several methodologies, extracellular synthesis of MNPs has received much attention because it removes the downstream processing process which is required for the recovery of MNPs in intracellular methodologies. Moreover, metal-resistant genes, proteins, enzymes, cofactors, and organic substance\n8 Nano-Based Materials and Their Synthesis\n132\nS. Chaudhary et al.\n133\n8 Nano-Based Materials and Their Synthesis\n134\nS. Chaudhary et al.\n135\nplay significant roles by working as reducing agents. Moreover, these provide natural topping to synthesize MNPs, thus avoiding the accumulation with and increasing stability of MNPs. In recent research, bacteria, including Pseudomonas deceptionensis (Jo et al. 2015), Weissella oryzae (Singh et al. 2015), Bacillus methylotrophicus (Wang et al. 2015), Brevibacterium frigoritolerans (Singh et al. 2016), and Bhargavaea indica (Singh et al. 2015), have been explored for synthesis of Ag and Au NPs. Similar potential for producing NPs has been showed by using several Bacillus and other species, including B. licheniformis, B. amyloliquefaciens, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Listeria monocytogenes, B. subtilis, and Streptomyces anulatus. Various genera of microorganisms have been reported for metal nanoparticle synthesis, including Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Escherichia, Enterobacter, Aeromonas, Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas, Weissella, Rhodobacter, Rhodococcus, Brevibacterium, Streptomyces, Trichoderma, Desulfovibrio, Sargassum, Shewanella, Plectonemaboryanum, Rhodopseudomonas, Pyrobaculum, etc. These investigations suggest that the main mechanism of the synthesis of nanoparticles using bacteria depends on enzymes, for instance, the nitrate reductase enzyme was found to be responsible for silver nanoparticle synthesis in B. licheniformis (Singh et al. 2016).\nRather than using bacteria, mycosynthesis is a straightforward approach for achieving stable and easy biological nanoparticle synthesis. Most fungi containing important metabolites with higher bioaccumulation ability and simple downstream processing are easy to culture for the efficient, low-cost production of nanoparticles. Moreover, compared with bacteria, fungi have higher tolerances to, and uptake competences for, metals, particularly in terms of the high wall-binding capability of metal salts with fungal biomass for the high-yield production of nanoparticles. Three possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain the mycosynthesis of metal nanoparticles: nitrate reductase action; electron shuttle quinones; or both. Fungal enzymes, such as the reductase enzymes from Penicillium species and Fusarium oxysporum, nitrate reductase, and /-NADPH-dependent reductases, were found to have a significant role in nanoparticle synthesis, similar to the mechanism found in bacteria. The synthesis of nanoparticles using actinomycetes has not been well explored, even though actinomycete-mediated nanoparticles have good monodispersity and stability and significant biocidal activities against various pathogens. The synthesis of silver, copper, and zinc nanoparticles using Streptomyces sp. has demonstrated that the reductase enzyme from Streptomyces sp. has a vital role in the reduction of metal salts. Similar to other microorganisms, yeasts have also been widely investigated for the extracellular synthesis of the nanoparticles on a large scale, with straightforward downstream processing. Furthermore, virus-mediated synthesis of nanoparticles is also possible. Viruses can be used to synthesize nanowires with functional components that are assembled for various applications, such as battery electrodes, photovoltaic devices, and super capacitors. Nanoparticles are slow with low productivity, and the recovery of nanoparticles requires downstream processing. Furthermore, problems related to microorganism-based synthesis for nanoparticles also include the complex steps, such as microbial sampling, isolation, culturing, and maintenance.\n8 Nano-Based Materials and Their Synthesis\n136"

      "text" : "In today’s world the type of material used in a device plays a significant role. The conventional materials like metals, polymers and ceramics have their limitations. Therefore the use of composites is introduced in various applications. In composites two or more materials are combined to increase the property of the material. This approach is further increased by introducing one of the components in the composite at nanoscale level (Hussain et al. 2006). Such a composite is called nanocomposite. Nanocomposites are multiphase solid materials in which one of its parts has dimensions in nanometre series (i.e. 109  m) (Roy et  al. 1986). Because of the increase in the area of surface and the effect of quantum at such a small scale, it’s mechanical, electrical, chemical and other properties get improved. Nanocomposites are different from the conventional composite materials. In conventional composite materials, reinforcements are added to the base in order to increase its properties, e.g. SiC when added to the aluminium alloy, its hardness and tensile strength increase (Gupta et  al. 2018). But nanocomposites are different from the conventional composites due to the fact that it contains exceptionally high aspect ratio. It is known as the material of the present era because of the property and design uniqueness which is not found in the traditional form of composites. There are still many areas in nanocomposites which are to be understood (Schmidt et al. 2002); on the other hand, it is to be noted that the first research was carried out in 1992\nS. Bharti · V.

For understanding the structure-property relationship, the area/volume ratio of reinforcement materials which is present in the synthesis of nanocomposites is very crucial. There found the opportunity to use the spinning CNTs into the products of composites (Dalton et al. 2003) which opens the way for the use of CNTs in the nanocomposites. In these days nanocomposites seem to provide the new technology to the industry along with its eco-friendly nature (Choa et  al. 2003).

Various recent reports are present which show recent development in the characterization, properties, preparation and crystallization behaviour of the matrix and layered nanocomposites (Ray and Bousmina 2005; Pandey et al. 2005). Ceramics has high thermal and chemical stability along with good wear resistance. But they are brittle in nature which limits its commercial use in the industry. Due to this reason, ceramic matrix nanocomposites come to existence which help to enhance its properties. A significant work on ceramic matrix nanocomposites (CMNC), primarily on the Al2O3/SiC system, is done by Niihara. The use of high-strength nanofibre in ceramic matrices helps the preparation of advanced nanocomposites which results in high toughness and superior failure properties as compared to the rapid failure of ceramic materials (She et al. 2000). Similarly metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNC) are the materials which contain the alloy matrix or ductile metal in which the nanosized reinforcement is entrenched. These materials increase the properties, e.g. ductility and toughness, and help to compensate the limitation of each other. Hence metal matrix nanocomposites are appropriate for the manufacturing of materials with more service temperature abilities and more strength in shear/ compression practices. MMNC show potential for their use in areas such as aerospace and automobile industries (Tjong and Wang 2004). Due to the easy process of manufacturing polymer materials and due to its properties, they are widely used in the industry. However, they have the limitations of having low modulus and strength as compared to metals or ceramics.\nS. Bharti et al.\n143\nThe addition of reinforcement to polymer resins results in great improvement of its biodegradability. There are incredible rewards for the use of nanocomposites, and hence worldwide attention is given to them.

Henri Braconnot, a French pharmacist and chemist, first discovered chitin in 1811. It is a linear polymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) linked by β-(1 → 4) bond, and chitosan is the deacetylated form of chitin. The main dissimilarity between chitin and chitosan is that in the latter acyl groups are absent which are attached by the amide bond in the chain of chitin. The free amines in the chitosan polymer act as functional group. The reactivity and solubility of the chitosan polymer are better than chitin and nontoxic in nature. Practically chitosan is β-(1 → 4)-linked D-glucosamine (GlcN) along with few GlcNAc. The physicochemical and functional properties of chitosan can be modified by changing the degree of deacetylation (DD), derivatization, and chemical hydrolysis (depolymerization) of the polymer (Halder and Mondal 2018). Chitosan is water insoluble but soluble in acidic pH. This is due to the fact that at low pH most amino groups transformed into protonated form and the positive charge reacts with water to solubilize (Sorlier et al. 2001).

Chitosan has a special property to control over the discharge of the active mediator and eliminate the hazardous solvents while constructing the particles in aqueous condition (Sheldon 2007). It is a very useful property to make immobilized enzymes. It is a polyamine comprising of free amino groups which are freely available for cross-linking with multivalent ions. The reactive hydroxyl groups exert a better enzyme coupling effectiveness in adsorption and covalent bonding of enzyme immobilization methods (Cao et  al. 2012). At the absorption site of enzyme, the residual time increases because of chitosan’s mucoadhesive character. Owing to its membrane-forming ability, low immunogenicity, good adhesion property, and hydrophobicity, chitosan is a potential immobilization matrix which provides excellent stability of the immobilized biocatalyst (de Moura et  al. 2008). Chitosan is also used in immobilization techniques because of its unique characteristics like enhanced resistance in degradation of chemical and elimination of metal ion disturbances to enzyme (Yang et al. 2010). It also can act in numerous shapes and forms. For example, in nuclease immobilization cross-linked with bifunctional glutaraldehyde with chitosan provides the support through interaction of amino group with the aldehyde groups. Chitosan acts through other functional groups like phenols, thiols, and imidazoles."

When a particle size reduces in nanometers, their properties and behavior (e.g., melting point, chemical reactivity, fluorescence, electrical conductivity, magnetic permeability, etc.) change from those at high scales, known as quantum effects, and they can imprison their electrons. The unique properties of nanoparticles are higher surface/volume ratio and melting temperature which provides tremendous driving force for diffusion. Due to size-dependent properties of nanoparticles, surface plasmon resonance is observed in some metal particles. It is used as enzyme immobilization because of its higher permeability properties through barriers (e.g., biological membrane, blood-brain barrier) and improved biocompatibility and some drug or active materials can be encapsulated, entrapped, adsorbed, or attached in micromo-\nS.

Due to its high surface to volume ratio, it is encouraging for enzyme immobilization. Nanoparticles on biocatalytic system provide elevated retention activity, as enzymes attached to the particle surface make them available for substrates. Numerous inorganic materials such as nanogold and graphene are used as matrices for immobilization of enzymes. Not only that, various biopolymeric supports are widely used for this purpose such as starch, agarose, cellulose, gelatin, albumin, chitosan, etc. (Katchalski-Katzir and Kraemer 2000; Lozinsky et al. 2003; Salemi 2010).

Polymer supports can be very effective because of its improved properties like reusability and thermal stability. The layer of polymer plays an essential role for protecting the active sites of enzyme in the reaction mixture. Various polymers having different functional groups are used as matrix for enzyme immobilization. For example, tyrosinase immobilized via –NH and C=O groups on nylon 66 and via –NH group of polyaniline alpha-amylase is immobilized (Ashly et al. 2011).\n10 Appraisal of Chitosan-Based Nanomaterials in Enzyme Immobilization…\n170\nBiopolymers\nBesides synthetic polymer, biopolymers are also used as an alternative matrix material for enzyme immobilization.

For various advantages like availability, abundance, and simple process in synthesis, these materials play an essential role as support for enzyme immobilization. The biopolymers have various special properties like biocompatibility, nontoxicity, and high affinity to proteins. Biopolymer reduces the structural deformation and properties of enzyme and helps to maintain high catalytic activity. Moreover, biopolymers are less expensive and therefore decreases the cost of immobilization process (Horchani et al. 2012; Vijayaraghavan et al. 2009; Homaei et al. 2013; Krajewska 2004).\nAlginates act as biopolymeric supports for its capability for gelation by using calcium and sodium ions and also for production of capsules which is capable of immobilization of single or multiple enzymes (Hwang and Gu 2013; Coradin et al. 2003). So, alginates are used for entrapment and encapsulation methods. But due to some limitations such as diffusional limitations and mechanical stability, its application is hampered. Immobilization of lipase through entrapment in calcium alginate beads and polyphenol oxidase encapsulated in copper alginate beads shows fine catalytic activity but poor reusability. Agarose is widely used as support because of its heteropolysaccharide chain composed of β-D-galactose and 3,6-anhydroalpha-L-galactose linked by glycosidic bonds. It has high gelation capability like alginates. It is used as capsules, beads, and fibers, leading great attention in industries. Agarose beads were used for entrapment of alpha-amylase and increase five times reusability of biocatalyst (Ball and Morell 2003; Delattre et al. 2011).

In the last century the Russian scientist Elie Metchnikoff delivered the concept of consumption of live microorganisms for health benefits (Gordon 2008). Generally probiotics are nonpathogenic live microorganisms which exert health beneficial effects when consumed in sufficient amounts. There are various health-promoting properties of probiotics, like (a) improves immune system in which it will supply, (b) maintains the natural gut microflora, (c) increases the lactose tolerance, (d) decreases cholesterol level, (e) exerts anti-carcinogenic properties, (f) inhibits pathogen by obstructing them to adhere the activation sites, (g) provides available supply of nutrient, and (f) removes toxin and its receptors (Prakash et al. 2011; Sullivan and Nord 2005). The various functions of probiotics assist in the decrease of the gene expression related with colonic cancer, prevent acute diarrhea, reduce the abdominal pain, defend the assault of pouchitis, and decrease the chance of ulcerative colitis and necrotizing enterocolitis. Probiotics can prevent or reduce the intestinal diseases such as (a) infectious diarrhea, (b) antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), (c) irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and (d) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera were employed as probiotic product (Hoffmann et  al. 2013). Probiotic microorganisms belong to the genus Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Propionibacterium, and certain yeasts like S. boulardii. Probiotics can exert their effect through various mechanisms. With the gut bacteria, probiotics can interact through three different portions such as epithelial layer, mucus layer, and GALT or gut-associated lymphoid tissue (Johansson et  al. 2011). Probiotics act on mucus layer and intestinal layer and make team with gut microbiota for the interference of pathogenic microorganisms through increases of the production of SCFA, blocking the adhesion of pathogens to lumen. Moreover, it has also produced some toxin like bacteriocin. Probiotics also enhance the barrier functions of Paneth cells, colonocytes, goblet cells, and enterocytes to increase the production of mucin, defensin, and IgA (Quevrain et al. 2016; Hong et al. 2011). It also acts upon M cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells to regulate cytokine production and Treg responses as well as some receptors situated on epithelium such as toll-like, C-type lectin, Nod-like and RIG-I-like receptors, etc. Some probiotics bacteria like Lactobacillus can exert their effects of immunomodulation through enhancing the production of some peptides (Bouskra et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2014)."

There are many obstacles until or unless the probiotics bacteria reach the target portion. Therefore, the protection in the passage of digestive system should be given to probiotics through encapsulation (Ramos et al. 2018). Encapsulation of probiotics provides improved survivality of the organism in the digestive system and provides protection from acidic condition, high oxygen levels, throughout the gastrointestinal passage. The most essential advantages of encapsulation are the following: (1) increase the adherence to mucosal tissue of the intestine, (2) enhance the resistance of bacteria, and (3) keep the cell viable for a long time (Chandramouli et al. 2004; Ramos et al. 2018)."

There are mainly three types of technique for encapsulation, these are (1) spray drying (Burgain et al. 2011), (2) extrusion (de Vos et al. 2010; Rokka and Rantamäki 2010), and (3) emulsion (Heidebach et al. 2012)."

Similarly survival rate of Bifidobacterium breve is reasonably good (6.6 ± 0.5  log cfu/mL) in immobilized state in alginate- chitosan after 1 hour in simulated gastric fluid (Cook et al. 2011). Saccharomyces boulardii yeast cells were encapsulated in chitosan and dextran sulfate which protect it from acidic condition in simulated gastric fluid (Thomas et al. 2014; Shori 2017). Gandomi et al. (2016) successfully encapsulated probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG incorporated in chitosan-alginate with inulin and examine their survival effect under stimulated gastric fluid and through storage of apple juice. The storage study was done during storage at 25 and 4 °C for 90 days. After the 90 days, the free bacterial survival diminished to 13.6%, but encapsulated L. rhamnosus provides 4.5-fold improved survival rate than free cells. Sensory scores revealed that encapsulation bringing the improvement of all characteristics of probiotics. This study advocated that probiotic encapsulation enhanced the bacteria survival rate both during storage of apple juice and in stimulated GI fluid without any adverse effect. Two probiotics bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were microencapsulated in calcium alginate-chitosan and Eudragit S 100 nanoparticles (Ansari et al. 2017). In the study free cells (unencapsulated), single coated (only with chitosan), and double-coated beads (chitosan and Eudragit nanoparticles) were applied in gastric juice without pepsin at pH 1.55 and in intestinal juice with 1% bile sat at pH 7.5. The outcome of the study showed that free bacterial counts diminished significantly (P < 0.001). The rate of decrease of free L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus was significantly faster than single- and double-coated formation of encapsulated probiotics. Due to the lack of strength of single chitosan-coated beads under pH 1.55, the counts reduced 5-log and 4-log of L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, respectively. But double-coated beads showed more viability of bacteria than that of single coated. Therefore, this study proved that encapsulation with chitosan and Eudragit S 100 nanoparticles showed improved survivability of L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus probiotics in the acidic environment of stomach. Kim et al. (2017) successfully encapsulated probiotics bacteria L. acidophilus through ionic gelation method and examine the encapsulated probiotics in stimulated gastric condition and storage. At first L. acidophilus encapsulated in biocompatible and biodegradable capsules constructed by ionic gelation between chitosan (CS) and phytic acid (PA). To increase the stability of capsules, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and starch were utilized. After 2 hours in acidic condition (pH 1.5, stimulated gastric fluid), the cells of L. acidophilus decreased only 0.64 log CFU/g. Among them, PA-CS-CaCO3 capsules are more stable than other two capsules in pH 1.5 and 2.0. This study proved that encapsulation provides more viability and storage capacity of probiotics bacteria.

Different types of nanocarriers, for example, quantum dots and metal oxides have shown adequate benefits over conventional detections, tagging of intracellular, and image of the target site. Nanotechnology has also provided many routes which enable increased detection of target cells. Proteins and DNA are used over a point for care of tool.

New detection systems were developed by researchers that are based on the electrochemical method, with a test of gold-enhanced nanoformulation conjugation of magnetic beads. This technique is very sensitive and specific for recognition of the DNA sequences of hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Hanaee et al. 2007). Electric potential of immunosensors increases with an increase in the amount of HBV (Tang et al. 2004). The study provides support that immunosensors can be used in the future as a detection system for hepatitis B virus. Gold nanoparticles are a preferred delivery system for immunosensors because of their compatibility with antibodies. Nanosized gold protein chips were created to detect and analyze antibodies of hepatitis B and C at the same time. Formulation of gold nanoparticles\n11 Nano-Based Drug Delivery Tools for Personalized Nanomedicine\n194\nprovides evenness and stability.

Gold nanoparticles detect MTB strands by DNA and RNA screening. MTB can be detected within few hours by nanoparticle probe (Veigas et al. 2010). Detection of MTB is based on pattern of color change due to aggregation of nanoparticles. The culture of MTB was important to analyze and detect bacterial strains. DNA fragments of MTB are broken down by electrochemical biosensors and are labeled by gold nanoparticles (Wang et al. 2013).\nNanotechnology is emerging as an advanced technique for the treatment of bone inflammation. Acton initiates as metallic nanoparticles offer a good surface for osteoblasts to connect to the bone. Metallic nanoparticles enable the growing of osteoblasts in a specific time interval and are helpful in successful osteo- regeneration. Nanocomposite materials induced specific protein for bone regrowth. Nanoformulated hydroxyapatite, the ceramic component of the bone, shows an increase in production of osteoblast (Tran and Webster 2009). Nanocomposites with carbon nanotubes also exhibit increasing osteoblast formation. Osteointegration process is accomplished in nanotubes by preventing the competition with other types of cells."

It is not only crucial for survival of living organisms but also drinking, domestic purposes (like cooking, washing and cleaning, etc.), and industrial as well as agricultural usages, e.g., irrigation for food production. In present scenario, several anthropogenic activities like revolutionary industrialization and urbanization, climate change, as well as the advanced agricultural practices have put massive strain on water resources including significant deterioration in water quality with increased water pollution and water crisis (Alcamo et al. 2017). Approximately, 844 million people lack basic drinking water facility, and 2 billion people drink fecal polluted water (WHO 2017). Also, it is anticipated that world’s population will enhance up to approximately 2.9 billion by 2050 (Rockström 2003). Scarcity of freshwater is also because of the use of water sources toward domestic, industry, as well as irrigation purposes globally (Rockström 2003). Pollution of surface as well as groundwater resources is an additional reason toward decreased freshwater availability. Mostly, in developing countries, surface water is polluted by industrial and domestic wastewater containing microbial agents (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) with rich source of metals (toxic at above certain concentration) like plumbing (Zn, Pb, Cu, Al, etc.), cosmetics (Fe, Cu, Zn, etc.), pesticides (Hg, Zn, Cu, etc.), detergents (Fe, etc.), and pharmaceuticals (Ag, Fe, Al, etc.). Furthermore, As, Hg, Pb,\nA. K. Singh Department of Biotech and Genome, School of Life Sciences, Mahatma Gandhi Central University, Motihari, Bihar, India\nP.

Pollutants in water not only cause waterborne diseases but also result in potable water crisis. It has been estimated that relatively 50% of the world’s population will live in water-stressed areas by 2025 (WHO 2017). Thus, there is urgent need to develop economical as well as stable materials together with innovative approaches by water industries so as to yield the freshwater in abundant quantities. There are various physical and chemical strategies like chemical precipitation, oxidation or reduction, filtration, ion exchange, evaporation and electrochemical treatment, reverse osmosis, etc., with the help of which one can get rid of the contaminants like heavy metals present in the water. However, the majority of these approaches turn out to be unsuccessful with heavy metals concentrations <100 mg/l (Ahluwalia and Goyal 2007). Biological treatment systems like activated sludge as well as biological trickling filters are not capable to eliminate vast range of increasing contaminants. Moreover, the majority of these contaminants are found to be soluble in the effluent (Amin et al. 2017). Considering these, it is obvious that conventional water or wastewater treatment strategies are found to be inefficient toward yielding sufficient harmless water owing to enhancing need of water together with strict health guidelines as well as newly emerged pollutants/contaminants. Therefore, nanotechnology-based multifunctional as well as extremely competent approaches are found to come up with solutions of water or wastewater treatments, which require no vast infrastructures/centralized systems (Amin et  al. 2017). Nanotechnology is found to be efficient toward solving aforementioned water issues concerning quality and quantity (Bottero et al. 2006). Among advanced water treatment systems, nanoparticles like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as well as dendrimers are playing important role for the development of improved treatment strategies (Porwal and Sharma 2016; Obare and Meyer 2004).\nNanotechnology is a technology-based science in diverse directions and deals with the processing, deformation, amalgamation, and separation of materials by molecules or atoms (Ardelean 2015). Nanotechnology has induced and heralded a new industrial revolution mainly due to their biocompatibility (Sharma et al. 2016). In today’s scenario, nanoscience due to the extraordinary properties of nanosized materials has become the thirst area for researchers. These nanosized materials are intervening macro and atomic or molecular level materials (Singh et al. 2018, 2019; Pandey et al. 2019; Rani et al. 2020 ). The unrestricted application of these nanoparticles in diverse field of science has boost their demand, and to meet the enhanced demand in a short time, researchers have utilized various physical and chemical methods to synthesize nanoparticles like arc-discharging liquid, lithography, laser ablation, gas phase deposition, ball milling (Blosi et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2006a, b), microemulsion, electrochemical deposition, coprecipitation sonochemical, and heat decomposition process (Chatterjee et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2012; Ramyadevi et al. 2012; Nakamura et al. 2007; Park et al. 2007). These methods produce metallic as well as other nanoparticles of diverse size and shape with numerous applications like agriculture, food processing, packaging, clinical diagnostics, wastewater treatment, and environmental remediation (Shan et  al. 2009; Macaskie et  al. 2010; Bradley et al. 2011; Zambrano-Zaragoza et al. 2011). But these environmentally\nA. K. Singh and P. Porwal\n203\nunfriendly methods of nanoparticle synthesis give rise to environmental hazards and biohazard (Singh et al. 2016, 2017; Rawat et al. 2018; Du et al. 2018). Thus, there is an urgent need to develop alternate approaches/methods for synthesis of nanoparticles that are eco-friendly and cost-effective and pose negligible negative effect on human health and can be exploited at commercial scale. Therefore, green synthesis of nanoparticles is an attractive strategy in current scenario, which is gaining huge importance owing to its nontoxicity, exploitation of renewable sources of energy, consumption of lesser energy, and operability at low temperatures with environment- friendly procedures over traditional approaches (Sharma et al. 2016). Green synthesis of nanoparticles involves biological systems like plant or microorganisms (like bacteria and fungi), which are responsible for the transformation of metal salts into nanoparticles by playing the role of reducing, stabilizing, and capping agents. The biosynthesis of nanomaterial exemplifies a link between nanotechnology and biotechnology. Among various applications of nanoparticles, the treatment of wastewater/contaminated water using nanobiotechnology is gaining tremendous attention globally in current scenario. This is owing to their simplicity, economic feasibility, and disinfection efficacy."

      "text" : "Generally, the fabrication of nanoparticles can be categorized into two, i.e., “topdown” and “bottom-up” approaches. In top-down approach, any chemical or physical method is used to convert bulk material into nanosized particles, while bottom-up approach utilizes any biological or chemical method to transform into nanoparticles from atom/molecules through a series of step (Fig. 12.1). Nanotechnologist mostly prefers bottom-up approach as nanoparticle synthesized by this is more homogenous in structural and chemical composition and the chances of imperfections are also minimized. Although the physical, chemical, and mechanical methods are the predominant conventional methods for nanoparticle synthesis, currently the biological methods are becoming more popular because of their several advantages over conventional methods (Fig. 12.2). Normally, nanoparticles are of two types, i.e., organic (include carbon nanoparticles) and inorganic nanoparticles; they comprise of metal nanoparticles like Ag, Pt, Au, and Pd magnetic and semiconductor nanoparticles like TiO2, SiO2, and ZnO2. Green synthesis of nanoparticles using different biomass like bacteria, algae, fungi, yeast, viruses, actinomycetes, plants and plant parts, pure or commercially available biomolecules, and biological waste materials is widely employed as a potential platform for fabrication of metallic nanoparticles (Mittal et al. 2013; Sharma et al. 2015). Mostly, a metal precursor is involved in the biosynthesis of nanoparticles, which is reduced or transformed either intracellularly or extracellularly using biological extract/biochemicals as a source of reductant present in the biomass (Asmathunisha and Kathiresan 2013). The extra-\n12 Nanotechnology as Potential and Innovative Platform Toward Wastewater…\n204\ncellular approach exploits plant/food extracts (downstream processing) for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles that produce highly energetic and more reactive spherical shape structure, while intracellular approach involves dissimilarities in reducing as well as stabilizing ability of phytochemicals present in different parts of the plants that are responsible to produce extremely disperse polymetallic nanoparticles of heterogeneous morphology. So, extracellular approach is desired over intracellular. Actual mechanism is yet to be established for the nanoparticle synthesis. However, scientists have proposed a hypothetical mechanism of nanoparticle synthesis (Fig. 12.3) based on the results obtained from specific biomass utilized (Velusamy et  al. 2016). Furthermore, plant-mediated approach is favored over microbial-based nanoparticle synthesis because of single-step method for biosynthesis (takes less time), nontoxic, economical, and eco-friendly process (Kavitha et al. 2013; Kumar and Yadav 2009). Due to rich biodiversity, plants are considered as warehouse for the nanoparticles synthesis, and their potential is yet to be completely exploited (Table 12.1).

Nanomaterials as an adsorbent are used in several forms such as absorptive, catalytic, catalytic membrane, bioactive nanoparticles, polymeric as well as nanocomposite membrane, etc., for treatment of wastewater. Nanometal oxides such as iron oxides like ferrous oxide, TiO2, and Al2O3 are used as adsorbents for heavy metals and radio nuclides (Mayo et al. 2007). Owing to the low toxicity and chemical stability, TiO2 nanoparticles are extensively employed as decontaminating and disinfecting agents, which remain stable throughout the process of decontamination (Savage and Diallo 2005). Sharma et al. (2018) reported that nanocomposite (TiO2–Fe2O3) can be used as an active microbial disinfectant that can eradicate E. coli through photocatalytic activity. Silver nanocatalyst N-doped TiO2 was used for the degradation of microbial contaminants (Prachi et al. 2013). Nano iron hydroxide and zinc oxide adsorbent permit adsorption of arsenic from drinking water and wastewater (Aredes et al. 2012). Nanotechnology also contributes in the field of agriculture by protecting the plants and enhancing their growth, e.g., colloidal solution of ZnO nanoparticles were used as a fertilizer (Sabir et  al. 2014), silica nanoparticles (plant nanobiotechnology) as a bio-insecticides, vector for gene delivery, pesticide delivery (mesoporous silica), protects quenching of active reagent (Baeza et al. 2015).

Oil core made of a neutral lipid, covered by monolayer of amphiphilic lipid, makes lipid emulsion, whereas liposomes are bilayer lipid vesicles made of amphiphilic phospholipid having an interior aqueous cavity (Jain 1997). On the other hand, SLNs are designed from solid lipids and stabilized with an aqueous suspension of emulsifying agents. They look a lot like nanoemulsion; the only difference is that liquid lipid is replaced with a solid lipid, hence providing an outstanding opportunity for controlled drug release as solid lipid lowers the movement of encapsulated drug drastically compared to liquid oil phase (Martins et al. 2007). Also, encapsulation in solid lipids improves the stability of incorporated chemically sensitive lipophilic ingredients in contrast to liquid lipids of nanoemulsion. These prospective benefits of physicochemical properties associated with the physical state of the lipid phase are as follows:\n(i) Movement of reactive radicals in solid material is slower compared to liquid medium and hence limits the degradation pathways.\n(ii) Phase partition of the API and lipid phase into the solid lipid thus prevents leaching of drugs at the surface of SLN.\n(iii) Enhanced absorption of inadequately absorbed drugs is reported after administration using SLN.\nLarge-scale production of SLNs could be achieved out in a cost-effective and relatively simple manner using high-pressure homogenization technique. Another approach for the production of SLNs is microemulsions or simply suspending liquid lipid in a solution of surfactant with stirring and sonication. SLNs made using various methods are present in suspension form; hence storing for prolonged period of time showed instability due to hydrolysis reactions. However conversion of SLNs into dry powder which can be reconstituted in order to improve stability of SLNs, with the help of lyophilization or spray drying, is an excellent way (Sinha et al. 2010). SLNs provide an excellent opportunity as an advanced drug carrier for oral delivery, topical administration, pulmonary administration, parenteral administration, gene delivery and potential adjuvant for vaccines. In a nutshell, they propose an extremely versatile platform for second- and third-order targeting of drugs.\nThe major advantages associated by SLNs are as follows:\n(a) Suitable for controlled drug release and drug targeting. (b) Suitable for delivery of both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. (c) Reduced toxicity compared to polymeric nanoparticles as SLNs are made of\nbiocompatible lipids.\nA. K. Jain and S. Thareja\n223\n(d) Provide protection to labile drugs from chemical, photochemical and oxidative degradation. (e) Water-based technology (organic solvents can be avoided).

Few problems associated with SLNs such as crystallinity and low entrapment have been overcome by nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) (Patlolla et al. 2010).

The core of the SLN comprises of the lipid; this core itself determines pharmaceutical properties of the particles such as drug stability and drug release.\nGenerally, two or more lipid combinations are useful because it allows manipulation of encapsulation efficiency and release kinetics and also the physical characteristics, i.e. melting point, crystallinity and polymorphism.

Figure 13.1 provides a graphical illustration of SLN production using hot homogenization method. Generally, hot homogenization method can be used for hydrophobic and poorly soluble drugs.

Usually, higher temperatures produce smaller particle size because of the reduced viscosity of the internal phase. Nevertheless, elevated temperatures fasten up the degradation process of the drug as well as of matrix. Also, homogenization process can be repeated several times. In majority, 3–5 homogenization rounds at 500–1500 bar are enough to obtain the desired size. It should be remembered that the high homogenization pressure or greater number of cycles often results in an increase of the particle size because of the occurrence of particle coalescence due to high kinetic energy of the particles.

Pre-suspension of microparticles is homogenized at or below room temperature; the cavitation forces produced by the homogenization process are strong enough to rupture the particles into solid lipid nanoparticles. Strict control of temperature is required in order to make sure that the lipid remains in the unmolten state even after increase in temperature during homogenization. Initial step is similar to hot homogenization that comprises the dispersing or solubilization of the medicament into the lipid mixture. Second step is rapidly cooling of the melt which leads to uniform pattern of API in the lipid particles. Also, reduced temperatures enhance the delicateness of the lipid and ultimately particle comminution. Figure 13.2 provides a stepwise production of SLNs using cold homogenization method.

Additives like butanol are less preferred with respect to regulatory aspects. The microemulsions show properties of emulsions as well as a real solution. Addition of a microemulsion to water leads to the formation of fine particles and hence could be exploited as method of preparation of SLN (Gasco 1993). Because of the involvement of a dilution step,\n13 Solid Lipid Nanoparticles\n230\nnoticeably inferior concentration of SLN has been produced compared to HPH method. First of all, a hot microemulsion is prepared by stirring 10% molten solid lipid, 15% surfactant and up to 10% of cosurfactant with water. This hot microemulsion is diluted with cold water (1:50) through an especially designed thermostated syringe. The mixture is kept on stirring while dilution which leads to nanoprecipitation of lipids. Figure 13.4 provides a stepwise illustration of production of SLNs using microemulsion-based method. Large-scale production of SLN is possible using microemulsion technique. The microemulsion is produced in a large tank which is heated through a temperature-controlled device. Later on, microemulsion is diluted by transferring it to a cold water tank where lipid precipitation takes place (Carli 1999).

The advantage of membrane contactor method is to manage the size of SLN by a suitable selection of membrane pore size and process parameters as well as it’s scaling-up ability (Rabinarayan and Padilama 2010).

Various gases, i.e. CO2, ethane CH2FCF3 and ammonia, were investigated and tried, but CO2 has proved itself as the best for SCF technique. The principle behind SCF technology is precipitating out of drug or particles by compressed anti-solvent, i.e. supercritical carbon dioxide (Yang and Ciftci 2016). The lipid and drug are dissolved in a solvent; the supercritical fluid, selected to act as anti-solvent to the solutes, is completely immiscible or incompletely soluble with the solvent. The dissolved solid in solvent is sprayed into the flowing SCF and leads to precipitation of solid solute particles (Byrappa et al. 2008).\nAnother method of SLN production using SCF method is considered as “supercritical extraction of emulsions” (SFEE) (Chattopadhyay et al. 2007).

Clearance of particles from the circulation by the\n13 Solid Lipid Nanoparticles\n234\nreticuloendothelial organs is also a size-based phenomenon (Wu et  al. 2012). Formulation-related variables (lipid nature, dispersing medium, surfactant, cosurfactant and other additives) as well as process variables (preparation method, extent of homogenization and sonication, temperature, equipment) are generally referred to as quality constraints. Size determination study of SLNs is carried out by scattering- based sizing techniques like photon correlation spectroscopy and/or laser diffraction. Particle size and morphology, therefore, may affect the entrapment and release kinetics of the therapeutics from the lipid nanoparticles.\nPhoton Correlation Spectroscopy\nPhoton correlation spectroscopy (PCS) or dynamic light scattering (DLS) is the mostly preferred technique to study the particle diameter of solid lipid nanoparticles in a suspension (Obeidat et al. 2010). It measures the fluctuation of the intensity of the scattered light which is caused by particle movement. PCS generally requires a tiny amount of sample, and that does not require any laborious sample preparation. It is nondestructive, faster technique which can determine the size range from 3 to 3000 nm approximately. PCS analyses the Brownian motion or random thermal of the particles in the suspended state in a dispersion medium. Particles in dispersion are irradiated by a laser light, and the changes in the intensity of scattered light are measured after multiple collisions of particles as a function of time. The PCS device has a laser source, which falls on the dispersion in a sample cell (temperature controlled), and scattered light is detected using a photomultiplier. Smaller particles cause high-intensity fluctuations compared to larger particles, because of their high diffusion coefficient. A statistical relationship is applied to correlate the scattering intensity vs time curve to obtain particle diameter and its distribution.\nThe technique gives the particle size, in terms of z-average diameter and polydispersity index (PDI) that is an indicative of the total length of the particle size distribution. The lower PDI is considered to be narrow particle size distribution, i.e. monodisperse suspension. Higher PDI values indicated poor uniformity of size distribution pattern. Most of the scientists recognize PDI values less than 0.3 as optimum values; however, 0.5 value of PDI is also sometimes accepted. Even though PCS is the extensively established technique, it is based on the translational diffusion coefficient D of the particles; hence it is an indirect method for measurement of particle size. Although PCS is a consistent method for analysing particles having tight distribution pattern, it is not recommended for multimodal size distributions. As presence of larger aggregates or microparticles may hinder the movement of nano range particles hence have a noteworthy effect on measurement process. SLN suspension is generally diluted in order to decrease manifold scattering effects. In addition PCS assumes that all the particles are of spherical shape; however, this is of least importance for SLNs but is a matter of concern for other colloidal carriers.\nA. K. Jain and S. Thareja\n235\nLaser Diffraction (LD) Spectroscopy\nLD is an effective tool which has a broader detection range (20 nm–2000 μm). Laser diffraction (LD), which is also known as laser light scattering, can be used alone or in combination with PCS to obtain an entire population of particle size from tiny ones to large particles. LD is depending on the composite phenomenon of Fraunhofer, Mie and Rayleigh scattering from an illuminated particle in dispersion state. Principle behind LD is that once a laser light falls on a sample having suspended particles, the bigger particles scatter light at narrow angles whereas the minor ones at broader angles (Stoye et al. 1998). Nevertheless the technique deficient in precision for particle dispersions has drastically smaller diameter compared to laser wavelength."

In contrast to light scattering-dependent method, individual particles are measured by the Coulter counter and microscope techniques; hence these provide the benefit of a closer straight analysis. In addition, the results generated by PCS and LD could be affected by the anisometric morphology of the particles. Therefore, the data produced by PCS and LD could be corroborated with EM to determine the real size of the SLNs.\nMorphology usually narrates to the external structure and surface pattern of the particle, while ultrastructure narrates to the internal structure of the particle. Ultrastructure indicates the existence and orientation of the different portions of the formulation and nanoparticle as a whole as well as associated structures like micelles, a core-shell structure which may or may not coexist. Generally, spheres have the minimum likely surface area out of other possible shape and, hence, could be stabilized with minimum quantity of surfactant. In addition, sphere particles have the greatest diffusion length and allow the opportunity of sustained and predetermined release of encapsulated therapeutics. In contrast, anisometric shape desires a\n13 Solid Lipid Nanoparticles\n236\nlarger quantity of surfactant for stabilization. It is highly required that the drug is to be entrapped into the surfactant layer or adsorbed onto outer layer.\nElectron Microscopy\nElectron microscopy provides the direct information on the particle shape. However, special concern is possible artefacts which may arise by the sample preparation procedures. For example, solvent removal may influence the particle shape. These techniques utilize the electron beam as an alternative of light to visualize nanoparticles.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) measures electrons sprinkled from the outer layer of the sample to largely create the surface structure, whereas transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measures electrons transmitted through the sample and allows to look beyond the surface. Both techniques have some drawbacks associated with processing conditions (e.g. vacuum, heating) as well drawbacks associated with sample preparation, i.e. dehydration, conductive coating staining, etc.; sometimes changes can be induced within the nanoparticles, while sample preparation and analysis might produce invalid results.\nTEM is also being used to determine the morphology and ultrastructure of SLNs (Friedrich et al. 2010). Sample preparation steps involve negative staining, freezefracture and vitrification to study the nanocarriers by TEM. Negative staining is carried out by utilizing heavy metal salt solutions on to the colloidal lipid dispersions (Blasi et al. 2013; Silva et al. 2011). A tiny droplet of SLN dispersion is kept on a TEM, grid stained with osmium tetroxide, phosphotungstic acid or uranyl acetate. Also, the resulting TEM photomicrographs generally may not be fair representations of the whole SLN population. Mainly TEM techniques provide information of two-dimensional projection of SLN; hence in order to get three-dimensional anisometric particles and to get additional information on the ultrastructure, freezefracture technique is utilized. The TEM micrographs of SLN after coating with uranyl acetate is shown in Fig. 13.7, which shows that SLNs have spherical shape and size from 80 to 200 nm (Li et al. 2006).\nAtomic Force Microscopy\nAtomic force microscopy is a superior method which can be used to study the realistic shape and surface morphology of the SLN. AFM offers few additional advantages compared to TEM and SEM. As vacuum is not required, the sample needs not to be coated by a conductive substance; however, the sample should be immobilized prior to scanning which can be easily done by removal of the aqueous media from SLN dispersion.

Generally, particle clustering occurs slightly for charged particles (high zeta potential) because electrical repulsion takes place between them. Though it is not tightly followed by the systems stabilized with steric stabilizers as adsorption of steric stabilizer around the particles diminishes the zeta potential but prevents aggregation (Müller 1996), zeta potential provides an idea about the amplitude of the electric attraction, or repulsion takes place among SLNs. Generally, greater zeta potential (e.g. more than +30 mV or less than −30 mV) stabilizes the SLN dispersion (Saupe et  al. 2006) which prevents the contact between the particles. Particle cell interactions can also be affected by surface. However, colloidal particles having zeta potential closer to zero can express good long-term stability if they are sterically stabilized with the help of stabilizers (Okonogi and Riangjanapatee 2013). Zeta potential is affected by the pH, type and concentration of ions present; hence, the effect of pH and electrolyte on the stability of SLNs has been studied (Choi et al. 2014).\n13 Solid Lipid Nanoparticles\n238"

To encourage drug solubilization, solubilizers can be added to the lipid melt. More complex lipids rather simple mixtures of mono-, di- and triglycerides and also containing fatty acids of various chain lengths produce crystals with many imperfections allowing space to accommodate the drugs (Westesen and Siekmann 1997).

Drug leakage and modification in the surface charge are likely during lyophilization. Therefore, addition of appropriate cryoprotectant such as mannose, maltose and trehalose (10–15%) is essential before lyophilization (Cavalli et al. 1997). The properties of the redispersed powder are largely affected by the selection of the cryoprotectant.\nAlternatively, spray drying is also another approach used to form powders from SLN dispersions. As heat is required in the process, hence lipids are preferred which have melting points higher than 70 °C. Sometimes it results in particle aggregation.

Because of which, nanotechnology or nanotech or nanoscaled technology is customarily weighed below 0.1 um or 100 nm (so nm scale is equivalent to 10−9 m). Nanoscale science (or nanoscience) investigates the phantasm and properties and also measures the varied responses of materials at various scales including atomic, molecular, and macromolecular levels along with the sizes falling universally in the range of 1–100 nm.\nIn the current scenario which is nowadays preeminently under 5 nm, the materials properties diverge incomparably (i.e., vital role being played by quantum-scale effects) vis-a-vis a bigger particulate scale. Nanotech involves various aspects which include design, manipulation, building, production, and application, which is achieved by regulating the shape and size, formulating the properties, responses, and performance of devices and systems up to < than 100 nm.\nNanotechnology being a branch of science and technology deals with the materials having the dimensional size of the order of nanometer scale. The term nanometer means that the scale unit is having 10−9 m value. These materials have the size less than 100 nm. Nanotech also denotes the manipulation of the matter on supramolecular scale, atomic scale, and molecular scale (Ganji and Kachapi 2015).\nAnother more authenticated and generalized definition of nanotech is imparted by the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) where it includes the manipulations of the element dimensions by measurably varying one of the dimensions from 1 to 100 nm. The basis of the above fact is that the quantum mechanical effects become significant in the quantum realm scale.\nTo conceive this idea of nanotechnology, one should observe the nail of the little finger. The dimensional width of the nail on the little finger is round about 10 million nm; another live example of the nanotechnology is the strand of human hair which is of the range 75,000–100,000 nm in diameter. This term was first coined in the late 1950s of the twentieth century especially around 1959. Being an umbrella phrase that beset all the fields of Science & Engineering at nanometer scale. Nanotech is immensely distinct and multidisciplinary field extending from the novel addendum of conventional physics devices to absolutely a new approach planted on the molecular self-assembly.\nNanotechnology being new was mainly talked by the then physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman in which he stated that “There is plenty of room at the bottom” (Feynman 1992).\nNanotech being an enabling technology is expected to revolutionize the major portions of the industrial sectors. The earliest widespread description of nanotechnology was primarily focused on the particular goal of precise manipulation of atoms and molecules which is required for the fabrication of macroscopic products.\nA. Bhardwaj et al.\n253\nThe NNI states any material to be in the nanotechnology state only if the concerned material fulfills all the conditions as [EPA, US 2007]:\n• Research and technological evolution centered at the atomic, molecular, or macromolecular levels ranging approx. from 1 to 100 nm • Creating and using systems, structures, and devices containing innovative properties and functions due their small or intermediate size • Manipulation and control ability at atomic scale\nNanotech being an appearing technology because of feasibility of put forwarding through going materials and to forge state-of-the-art materials having utterly unique features and functionality instilled with colossal abilities for wider spectrum of applications. Supplemental to its utility in industrial arena, pioneering innovations can be forecasted in various fields like ICT, medical and allied technology, metrology, etc. (Seeman 2003).\nSymbolic utilizations of nanosciences and nanoengineering field can be seen in various arenas like pharmaceuticals, cosmetic products, canned food, chemical engineering, materials with high performance, electronic items, precision mechanics, light energy models, energy generation, and environmental sciences.\nNanoscience (nanotechnology) is the most energized discipline of science and technology as it promises superior health, wealth, defense, and closing ranks between science and fiction. It has grown rapidly over the years and has already gained considerable international and national interest. It has abeyance for making enormous impact on the society, humanity, and ecology apart from their immediate uses in hardware and electronics system (Kumar 2006; Phillips 2006).\nTheir direct and indirect impact would be widespread, and it would give a new boost to various emerging technologies such as information technology, data storage, semiconductor technology, sensors and actuators, pharmaceutical, biomedicine, biotech, chemical industry, aerospace, and automotive industry.\nAs the particle size reduces and reaches the nanoscale regime, the surface area to volume ratio of the particle rapidly increases. The number of atoms on the surface of the particle in this size range will dramatically increase compared to the atoms within the particle. A particle of 5 nm in diameter has nearly 50% of its atoms on the surface compared to the 100 nm particle where less than 5% are surface atoms. This affects the internal structure of the particle including the arrangement of atoms and the electronic configuration, and quantum effects dominate (Ferrari 2007).\nIn the 1980s era, two major discoveries stimulated the growth of nanotechnology in modern era:\n• The first comprised of scanning via tunneling microscope discovery in the year 1981 which put forward the visualization of individual atoms along with their bonds. In year 1989 the above said technique was successfully put into action to maneuver distinctive atoms. Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer who were the developers of the microscope at IBM’s research lab at Zurich got Nobel Prize in\n14 Nanotechnology Applications and Synthesis of Graphene as Nanomaterial…\n254\nthe field of physics in 1986 (Meyyappan 2004; Novoselov et  al. 2004). In the same year, the discovery of analogous atomic force microscope made by them led to the revolution in the field of nanotech. • The second comprised of the discovery of fullerenes in 1985 by Kroto, Smalley, and Curl for which they won the Nobel Prize in the field of chemistry in 1996. C60 was initially not considered in the nanotech field but was then considered with the discovery of graphene tubes (called carbon nanotubes and every now and then known as the buckytubes) with numerous utilizations in the field of electronics (Meng et al. 2012).\nThe nanotech field during the 2000s called for upsurge in scientific, political, and commercial attention that resulted in development and controversy at the same time. The major skepticisms were related to the definitions and utilities of nanotech. In 2001 and 2003, apprehensions surfaced about the feasibility of applications forecasted by supporters of molecular nanotech, which ultimately ended up with a public discussion between Drexler and Smalley. Further the profit-oriented products started to appear with the progression of nanotech in the world. These materials are narrowed down to a wide-scale usage of these nanomaterials without the inclusion of any atomic control of matter (Wang et al. 2012).\nVarious instances of these encompass the usage of nanoparticles of silver as antibiotics, sunscreens composed of nanoparticle components, silica nanoparticles to strengthen carbon fiber, and clothing made of CNTs with stain resilience properties.\nGovernments nowadays have started promoting nanotechnology and invested funds in the research field of nanotech; for example, the USA started with the NNI that gave a size-dependent description of nanotech and facilitated monetary support for explorations and analysis on the nanoscale. Similarly the European Framework Program was established to give a boost in the development of nanotech. The mid- 2000s saw the prospering of innovative and serious scientific concerns in these fields.\nVarious projects evolved for making nanotech road maps based on meticulous maneuvering of matter with discussions on both present and future capacities and goals."

They have standard aspect ratio to be in the range of 3–5. They are manufactured through chemical synthesis after the combination of ligands which are acting as shape-controlling agents bonding to obtain different facets of nanorods of varying strengths. They are majorly implemented in MEMS-based devices and accelerometers (Lakhtakia 2012; Respaud et al. 2016). • Nanocomposite: These are the multiphase solid materials in which one phase is provided with one, two, or three dimensions of less than 100 nm. In some cases more than one phase dimensional size is in nm range, and they are thus embedded in the metal, ceramic, or polymer matrix. • Nanocoatings: These are the nanosized thin films which are applied to the surface of various materials so as to enhance the various characteristic features of the materials such as the corrosion protection, protection against the degradation caused by the water and ice element, frictional minimization, antifouling and antibacterial properties, self-cleaning property, and resistance to heat and radiations along with thermal management. Nanocoatings are used for aerospace, defense, medical, oil, marine, and metallic industries (Kolyadina et al. 2016). • Graphenes: They are nowadays a very attractive material for post-CMOS or silicon electronics because of their high carrier mobility and planar structure, thereby making the integration with the standard technology easier than that of CNTs. Moreover, nowadays the 2D material systems have gained a great amount of attention among various global research communities. They are majorly 2D material with only one-atom thickness (Imperiale et al. 2010). • Thin films: These comprise of the layers of materials having thickness in the range of few nm to several mm.\n14 Nanotechnology Applications and Synthesis of Graphene as Nanomaterial…\n256"

      "text" : "The demand for fast response time devices is increasing tremendeously in the past few decades. With the reduction in the area of devices, the conventional semiconductor devices are not suitable because they tend to exhibit the second-order effects. This leads to the technology scaling of the devices. This leads to shift in the technology and made researchers to search for alternative materials to be used in electronics industry. Out of many materials, graphene and CNT have commanding presence in the electronics industry.\nThere are several areas for applications of graphene due to its properties such as high conductivity. Its large surface area makes it a promising material for batteries and for energy storage applications (Bae et al. 2010), while its transparency, conductivity, and flexibility make it an interesting material for flexible displays and touch screens (Novoselov et al. 2004). Other applications include the use of graphene as a conductive ink, chemical sensor, barrier layer, or heat spreader. Yet, the initial interest in graphene was sparked by its potential for post-silicon optical and electronic applications, due to its high intrinsic mobility, scalability, and observed electric field effect (Novoselov et al. 2004; Schwierz 2010).\nThere is limitation while looking forward for miniaturization of the devices there is limitation for scaling of device technology while following the Moores law (Schaller 1997). The time limit for reaching the limit has been postponed with more innovations in structures and architectures utilized by researchers throughout the world. The limit is about to reach its full restriction when the length of the transistors becomes less than 10 nm.\nAt this duration the potential of graphene as electronic material can be utilized. Thus the research on improving and modifying various techniques related to graphene need to be improved. Since the last decade, there is tremendous research related to problems associated with graphene-based electronics reported by researchers across the globe. There is definitely some more time requirement in the future to fully develop graphene-based transistors so as to replace silicon-based electronics.\nThe structures developed using graphene for logic transistors are probably different than the contemporary MOS structure. This is attributed to the difference in properties of graphene and silicon.\n14 Nanotechnology Applications and Synthesis of Graphene as Nanomaterial…\n258\nBecause of its high mobility, graphene is considered to be an important material for devices that require ultrahigh speed such as analog and digital logic circuits. Use of devices in RF applications with graphene is nowadays very much prevalent. As graphene possesses remarkable optical property of linear dispersion. This property of Dirac electrons drives the use of graphene-based optoelectronic devices in broadband applications. Graphene is known to exhibit high optical damage threshold, and high third-order optical nonlinearities of graphene devices are also implemented in photonic devices. The application of graphene can be further extended to interconnect and to achieve that there is requirement of techniques so as to realize various applications as reviewed. Graphene being an extraordinary material used in the channel of devices is very much useful in highfrequency RF applications. On the basis of available facts, it can be clearly stated that graphene possess ultrahigh mobility that leads to ballistic transport at mm scale, along with large saturation velocity. In addition to high-frequency applications, they are also used in the design of LNA (low-noise amplifier). As it is well known fact that the RF transistors have maximum frequency of oscillation (fmax) and the cutoff frequency (fT). Currently the highest reported cutoff frequency for graphene MOSFET is 427 GHz, and the maximum fT is 45 GHz (Wu et al. 2016). Figure  14.1 describes the cutoff frequency for graphene transistors and other competing transistor types.\nA. Bhardwaj et al.\n259\nThe various improvements in the cutoff frequency are depicted in Table 14.1. The comparison analysis of various characteristics is shown in Table 14.2. Another material that has also found numerous applications in the field of electronics is carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Because of the rapid scaling of electronic devices, the energy consumption is a major cause of concern for researchers (Lin et al. 2011). Most of the researchers are now focusing their concern onto the ultralow-power sensors. Out of most of the sensors, gas sensors for air quality detection consume maximum power when used, so CNTs are used instead for energy- saving process. CNT-based gas sensor devices can detect NO2 with power consumption of less than 50 nW. CNTs are innovative devices with good transistor scalability with growth in performance, and CNTFETs have outstanding current capability. CNTFETs have been extensively used at 32 nm technology and also below 28 nm. As it is well-known that the modern-day wireless receivers have to support a variety of wireless standards working at different frequency bands, thus there is an immediate requirement of power conservation devices. The perfect solution to these problems is the CNTFETs which have transit frequency (fT) in the range of terahertz (THz).

      "text" : "The structure of graphene can be described as a 2D honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms having thickness of one atom. Graphene being an allotropic form of carbon is 2D (two-dimensional). It has a hexagonal lattice packing at the atomic scale. Its structure is similar to other allotropes of carbon, namely, CNTs, graphite, charcoal, and fullerenes (C60 buckminsterfullerene). The aromatic molecule is considered to be of indefinitely large size. The combination of the words graphite and “ene” was first coined by scientist Hanns-Peter Boehm in 1962. It was discovered by Konstantin Novoselov and Andre Geim in 2004 at the University of Manchester (Hancock 2011). Graphene is a layered material with single-atom-thick layer of graphite (McClure 1956; Slonczewski et al. 1958; Wallace 1947). Although its existence is theoretically known for many years, single-atom layer is considered as thermodynamically unstable.\nNovoselov et al. were the initial researchers who experimentally identified the single-atomic-layer structure of graphene. The findings are not in contradiction to the theory as the layer was well supported on the substrate (Novoselov et al. 2004). Also demonstration of high mobility is done experimentally during examination of electrical properties.\nIn 2010, Nobel Prize in physics was awarded for revolutionary experiments on 2D graphene materials. Graphene is a flat monolayer of carbon atoms which are tightly packed in order to achieve honeycomb structural lattice. One carbon atom is covalently bonded with three adjacent carbon atoms as shown in Fig. 14.3 through sp2 hybridization, while the rest of the pz carbon orbitals form an extended electron system (Thakur and Thakur 2015). Due to the unique electronic state of graphene, it possesses appreciable electrical properties.\nA. Bhardwaj et al.\n261\nGraphene has been known for excellent properties that include high mobility (105 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature), high current density (109 A/cm2), high thermal conductivity, and good mechanical properties."

The charge carriers in these materials consisting of several layers are confined naturally in plane. This results in a weak van der Waals interaction between the nanomaterial and its surroundings (Mas-Balleste et al. 2011).\nDue to this reason, 2D nanomaterials are sometimes classified as van der Waals materials. This weak interaction of graphene aids in the isolation of single-layer materials, with thickness of single atomic layer. The single-layer thickness of 2D nanomaterials like graphene makes them a suitable option to help meet the scaling demand requirement of future technology scenarios. These unique properties of graphene have attracted researcher’s interest throughout the research community, thus elevating graphene’s status to that of a true wonder material.\nGraphene is being considered as a wonder material nowadays because of its exhibition of remarkable properties (Burtscher 2005):\n• Electronic properties: Electron mobility possessed by graphene materials is surprisingly very high; the value of mobility reported at room temperature is noted to be around 15,000 cm2 V−1 s−1. • Optical properties: Graphene possess high value of opacity in the case of atomic monolayer; in the initial stages, it is capable of absorption with πα ≈ 2.3% fraction of white light, the portion which is incident on its surface. • Thermal properties: The thermal conductivity of graphene at room temperature is in the range of 4.84 ± 0.44 × 103 to 5.30 ± 0.48 × 103 Wm−1 K−1 (Burtscher 2005). • Mechanical properties: The breaking strength of graphene as compared to that of steel is 200 times more, with a reported tensile modulus (stiffness) of 1 TPa (150,000,000 psi).\n14 Nanotechnology Applications and Synthesis of Graphene as Nanomaterial…\n262\n• Graphene is lighter, harder, stronger, and more flexible than steel.

SWNTs (single-walled nanotubes) are used for sensor applications as well as for the development of FED (field emission displays). • Double electron layer tunneling transistors (DELTTs): The most influencing quantum effect in transistor-like devices is tunneling which signifies that the particle plunges into the barrier which would not have been possible in the real world. They are built with a planar process using conventional semiconductor deposition. DELTT has an insulating barrier between two 2D walls. In this device\nA. Bhardwaj et al.\n263\nthe operation is accomplished by the modulation of 2D-to-2D tunneling between the two coupled quantum wells and doesn’t require lateral depletion or lateral gating. • Resonance tunneling devices (RTDs): These devices are specifically two- terminal devices comprising very high switching speed. RTDs for logic applications include resonant tunneling diode and hybrid devices in which resonant tunneling diodes are incorporated with single- or multi-FETs (RTD-FETs). Although they are not strictly transistor devices as they don’t have a third terminal, these devices are used in addition with transistors to increase the performance of conventional circuits. • Single-electron transistors (SETs): These devices are three-terminal switching devices that transfer the electrons from source to drain. SETs include quantum dots, small conducting materials, as basic building material. • Spin logic devices (SLDs): The category includes a novel device, spin metaloxide- semiconductor field-effect transistor (spin MOSFET). The device possesses a MOS gate structure and contacts having half metallic ferromagnetic (HMF) property for the source and drain. The other variations of the device include property called spin-torque transistor which provides new devices that include spin gain transistor (SGT) and magnetoresistive element (MRE) hybrid hall effect (HHE) devices (Hua-Qiang et al. 2013). • Hybrid hall effect (HHE) devices: This particular class of devices includes single- or multiple-input wires passing over a region consisting of ferromagnetic material. The magnitude of the current in the direction of the input wire is large, and the magnetic field thus generated results in the magnetization of the ferromagnetic element, in right- or left-hand side direction. This direction absolutely depends on the direction of the current flow. • CNT-based field emission devices (FEDs): Field emission devices are basically electron emitters, which emit electrons on application of high electric field. Conventional cathode-ray tube and other electron emitters employ thermionic emission process. In the preceding process, the electron overcomes the work function barrier by thermally heating the cathode. But the field emission is different from the thermionic emission as in this process a very high electric field is applied at the tip of the emitter due to which the surface potential becomes very narrow and the electron tunnels through the barrier potential (Yeole and Padole 2015).\nGraphene being a wonder material can be manufactured with the help of wellequipped and highly advanced environment instilled with the world’s most advanced technology. The synthesis and application of graphene oxide nanosheets for the removal of toxicants from water is as shown below (Khurana et al. 2018):\nFrom the above method shown in Fig. 14.4 for the formation of the graphene material, we define the following steps:\nStep 1: Take some amount of graphite which is a composite of carbon, and add a few ml of sulfuric acid, i.e., H2SO4. A little amount of nitric acid, i.e., HNO3, is also added to the mixture.\n14 Nanotechnology Applications and Synthesis of Graphene as Nanomaterial…\n264\nStep 2: Afterward the slow addition of potassium permanganate, i.e., KMnO4, in the mixture is accomplished which is followed by stirring done at a temperature less than 5 °C, i.e., temp ≤5 °C.

Step 4: Add 50% of HNO3 and subsequently heat for 30 min or half an hour. Step 5: The mixture thus obtained is washed with D.W. till the pH returns to its\nneutral value of 7. This then leads to the formation of graphite oxide.

With the increase in population, universal energy use is expected to escalate in the succeeding 20  years by approximately 40% (Fig. 15.1) and almost two-fold by 2050 (Brinker and Ginger 2011). The worldwide energy demand is expected to remain roughly around 30 TW (terawatt) by the year 2050 and 46 TW (terawatt) by the year 2100 (Sahaym and Norton 2008; Hussein 2015). The most urgent and primary technological challenge our society is encountering these days is meeting the energy needs of the world’s growing population in a geopolitically and environmentally sustainable manner (Lewis and Nocera 2006; Lewis 2007). Since there is a substantial worldwide competition for these limited energy resources, it is likely to have significant social and geopolitical consequences, making energy a security issue for every nation. Energy powers our life. Thus, life requires energy. An essential approach of all life forms is to retain energy. Therefore, subconsciously, every living being always opts for the ways and means of least resistance to energy (Ghernaout et al. 2018).\nToday, the greatest attention in the world is devoted to energy sources because their use is irrevocable. In the present times, the fundamental energy supply for human survival comes primarily from fossil fuels (natural gas, crude oil, and coal). The supplies of traditional fossil fuels are running out at a very rapid pace. The overall potential of fossil fuels accessible on earth is measured at approximately 5.500 MTOE (million tons oil equivalents) with 60% credited to coal, nearly 30%\nN. Raina (*) · P. Sharma · P.

Pathak School of Energy Management, Faculty of Engineering, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India\n272\nto natural gas, and approximately 10% to crude oil (Luther et al. 2015). It is stated that the current petroleum spending is 105 times quicker than that nature has the capacity to generate. Therefore, at this enormous speed of spending, the global fossil fuel reserves are likely to shrink before 2050 (Hussein 2015; Satyanarayana et al. 2011). One of the most imperative concerns for countries world over is dealing with the degrading environment combined with the rising economic baggage of feeding expanding populations. Excessive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in addition to the insufficient fossil fuel supplies are the current global energy problems resulting from increased fossil fuel consumption.\nOil price troble, environmental worries emerging out of the upsurge in global warming, exhausting economies, and dropping reservoir of non-renewable resources have put alternative sources into the limelight. With the aim of enabling an overall sustainable development, there is an urgent requirement to look for alternative, clean energy sources which are renewable and can replace fossil fuels (Deng et al. 2016). Because of the huge energy demand and low future availability of fossil fuels, there is a worldwide drift toward sustainability which is believed to rely heavily on renewable energy resources. Absence of fuel requirement decreases the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) from renewable energy sources. Renewable energy can endow us with light, heat, and electricity devoid of environmental contamination. Solar energy, wind, tide, geothermal energy, etc. are potential renewable resources as they do not get exhausted with continuous usage and are environmentally benign (Deng et al. 2016; Bruce et al. 2008; Panwar et al. 2011).\n“Energy efficiency” fuels the universal sustainable energy domain by incorporating technologies which fulfill the global energy outburst. Many technologies have made handsome strides in notable discipline/s of sustainability era. Nanotechnology is one of them. It is one of the topical technologies worldwide that is drawing immense research by scientists universally. These technologies comprise discovering sustainable energy sources, reducing pollution, furnishing unpolluted drinkable\nN.

However, few have made exponential gains in enhancing energy efficiency. Among them, prominent breakthroughs are still in pipeline in the renewable energy sector that will allow us to sustain our rising desire for energy in order to fulfill growing demands of the ever-increasing world population.\nThe twenty-first century presents mankind with an immense technical challenge which has been the expansion of technologies related to renewable energy resulting from some grave problems related to the utilization of energy and creation of energy from substrates. Renewable energy is poised to play a significant part in the global electricity mix by the year 2030. Going by the Alternative Policy Scenario, renewable energy sector will be supplying over two-thirds of the total electricity globally by that time (IEA 2007). Hence, nanotechnology can be viewed as a novel candidate for clean energy applications since it holds the key for several technological developments within the energy sector especially storage and transmission. Nanotechnology and nanoscience have the competence to offer resolution to quite a lot of these worldwide challenges (Ghernaout et al. 2018; Poinern 2014; Hussain et  al. 2017; Hussein 2016; Quandt and Özdoğan 2010; Santos et  al. 2015). The implementation of nanoscience to “practical” gadget/apparatus is called “nanotechnology” (Kandil 2016). It has the potential to be the basis of the next industrial development. It deals with some of the distinct mechanical, chemical, electrical, and physical parameters that arise due to restructuring matter at the nanometer scale. Materials can present diverse chemical, physical, and biological properties at the “nano” phase than they do at larger dimensions (Mathew et al. 2018). As a matter of fact, every individual present on earth has come across nano-sized particles. Every individual has been vulnerable to nanometer-ranged foreign elements. We draw them in with every breath and consume them with every gulp.\nIt is the science of investigating and exploring the distinctive properties of matter by fabricating new structures at an atomic scale of 1–100 nm. Mathematically, it is the billionth part of a meter (10−9  m) (Alkahtani 2018) in most classifications (Fig.  15.2). It deals with clusters of atoms of 1  nm at least in one dimension. Nanoscience gives materials distinctive properties such as size, nature, and performance, all due to change in their scale.\n15 Efficiency Enhancement of Renewable Energy Systems Using Nanotechnology\n274"

The science of nanotechnology revolves around the basic idea of carrying out nanoscale manipulations and creating nanoscale objects. The origin of the concept is usually related to a discourse at the December 1959 congregation of the American Physical Society by world renowned Nobel laureate and physicist Richard Feynman. Feynman, during his well-known 1959 speech at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) entitled “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom” (Feynman 2012; Khan et al. 2017), asked “What would happen if we could arrange the atoms one by one the way we want them?” (Goddard III et al. 2012; Buzea et al. 2007). His discourse described various stimulating experiments and the infinite possibilities afforded by “tininess.” Since then there have been diverse groundbreaking expansions in this domain such as homeland security, medicine, information technology, energy, environmental science, food safety, transportation, and many others.\nThe term “nanotechnology” was first brought up in history in the late nineteenth century (1867) when James Clerk Maxwell published his primary remarks about this technology and offered potential of maneuvering distinct particles (Zekić et al. 2018; El Saliby et al. 2008). A Japanese scientist of the Tokyo University of Science, named Norio Taniguchi, was the first to use the term “nanotechnology” at a conference in 1974 (Kandil 2016; Aviram 1988). He used the term for describing semiconductor processes (for instance, ion beam milling and thin film deposition) which displayed characteristic control over the nanometer array. He defined “nanotechnology” as mainly consisting of the processing of separation, consolidation, and deformation of materials by one atom or “one molecule”. However, in 1980, Eric Drexler in his first paper on nanotechnology again used the term “nanotechnology” being totally unaware of Taniguchi’s prior use of the same term (Kandil 2016).\nMany “nano” words have showed up in glossary, for instance, nanogram, nanometer, nanorobotics, nanoscience, nanosecond, nanostructure, nanotechnology, nanotube, nanowires, and many more. Some more uncommon words consist of nanoantenna, nanoarrays, nanocavity, nanocrystal, nanoelectronics, nanoencapsulation, nanofibers, nanolithography, nanomagnet, nanoprecursor, nanopatterning, nanoporous, nanoseparation, nanovalve, nanosequencing, nanoscaffolds, etc. Numerous words that are not broadly perceived are used in some esteemed publications."

      "text" : "The world of nanotechnology is ever-evolving. It is showing enormous possibilities in countless fields of science and technology by functioning at an elementary level. It is creating a lot of vigilance nowadays. It is not just a catchphrase but the future\nN. Raina et al.\n275\nof technology since it impacts every sector. It is the combined study of engineering and chemistry fields and is classified as the arrangement, assembly, and application of resources and appliances whose dimensions have been engineered at the nanoscale. Widely, the word “nano” is employed as prefix to illustrate matter, structures, or processes with characteristics coming from nano-sized structures. On the basis of overall shape, these materials can be classified as 0D (quantum dots, nanoclusters, and nanoparticles), 1D (nanotubes and nanorods), 2D (nano-sized thin films), or 3D (nanomaterials) (Khan et al. 2017; Tiwari et al. 2012) (Fig. 15.3).\nNanoscience creates an enormous prospect not only within the intellectual society but also among sponsors, administration, and industry due to its unique ability to engineer elements at an atomic scale. It has created novel equipment/devices with potential relevance in an extensive number of disciplines. Nanoscience and nanotechnology facilitate vast array of technologies that attain abundant and low-cost alternative energy production, efficient energy use, transmission, and storage. This section demystifies the topic for anybody engrossed on how nano-sized molecules and the nanotechnology involved affects our everyday lives. The relevance of nanomaterials is rising in diverse zones (Fig. 15.4), together with public health, agriculture, clothing, medicine, cosmetics, and food owing to their exceptional capability to boost bioavailability and solubility and to safeguard bioactive compounds while they are being prepared and then stored for use (Bajpai et al. 2018). Nanoparticles as coating materials have been the center of attraction over the previous few decades with their exceptional relevance in different spheres (Khezri et  al. 2018). The study of these nanoparticle materials is an important element of nanoscience. It is regarded worldwide as the key technology for innovations and technological advancement in nearly all domains of economy (Table 15.1). Some of the improvements using scientific conception regarding the benefits of controlling materials at nanoscale have resulted into commercially viable products and technologies based on nanomaterials as given below:\n1. Influence of nanotechnology on transportation and sports equipment: Increase in the toughness of lightweight sporting instruments/gadgets, extending from baseball bats, tennis and badminton racquets, hockey sticks, racing bicycles, golf balls/clubs, skis, fly fishing rods and archery arrows, etc. are some of the sporting\n15 Efficiency Enhancement of Renewable Energy Systems Using Nanotechnology\n276\nequipment, whose performance and durability are being enhanced with the assistance of nanotechnology (Nano werk 2013). In automobile sector, nanopolymers are used in paint coatings, lightweight body parts, self-cleaning nanofilms, scratch- and abrasion-resistant coatings, tires, mirrors and glasses, nanofilters for air cleaning, exhaust emission reduction, cooling systems, and many more. In aerospace, it is being applied to engines (improves heat transfer, lubrication) and tires (reduced friction, durability). In marine transport, nanostructured coatings are scratch resistant, and body parts made of nanoclay are light and tough (Mathew et  al. 2018). Nanoscale sensors and instrument may possibly provide cost-effective constant monitoring of the structural integrity and functioning of bridges, tunnels, rails, parking structures, and pavements in due course (National Nanotechnology Initiative 2012). 2. Food safety and as cleaning agent: Nanotechnology has come to light as a scientific development tool to transform the agrifood sector, with the potential to improve global food production, in addition to the nutritional use, quality, and safety of food (Peters et  al. 2016; King et  al. 2018). Nanomaterials have been used to eradicate contaminants (Sun et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2012), as antimicrobials (Kim et al. 2007; Morones et al. 2005) and as antioxidants (Deligiannakis et al. 2012). Besides being used in sensors for detection of pesticides, chemicals, heavy metals, foodborne pathogens and toxins, preservation, and food packaging (Gestal and Zurita 2015; De Francisco and GarcÍA-Estepa 2018), nanotechnology is also used in the removal of pesticides (Yu et al. 2017; Yu and Yang 2017; Krishna et  al. 2018). Food industry includes food nano-preservation (encapsulation, humidity treatment), food nano-functionality (enhancement of physical qualities and nutritive value), and food nano-packaging (intelligent sensing/active antimicrobial/bio-based edible packaging) (Bajpai et al. 2018). Nanomaterials are used as cleaning agents in industrial solvents to remove groundwater contamination\nN. Raina et al.\n277\n(Yunus et  al. 2012). Inexpensive, portable water purification systems using nanoscience can provide universal access to safe water (Pulizzi and Sun 2018; Jassby et al. 2018). Commonly used materials using nanotechnology in water purification systems have been documented (Suthar and Gao 2017). Nano-based films that can be applied to countertops or windows makes it much easier to keep those surfaces clean. Decontamination of industrial sites through environmental remediation by removal of numerous contaminants is another field where nanotechnology is working wonders (Guerra et al. 2018). 3. Medicine and cosmetics: Glucose-sensing tattoos, contact lenses, and skin patches examine diabetics’ blood sugar levels and cautions when its level reaches upper or lower extreme (Aslan et al. 2005). In drug delivery systems, nanoparticles are effective due to site-specific targeting, high drug loading, side effect reduction, controlled and sustained drug release, manipulation of drug particle size, and surface characteristics (Simonazzi et al. 2018). In healthcare sectorinexpensive flexible and durable “electronic skin” sensors are used in robotic\n15 Efficiency Enhancement of Renewable Energy Systems Using Nanotechnology\n278\nsystems and prosthetic limbs. Also nanotechnology helps in the field of visual realities, professional sports and entertainment sector to detect changes in pressure, humidity, and temperature thus enhancing experience (Lu et al. 2018). In wound dressings, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems improve wound healing (Kalashnikova et al. 2015). In bandages, nanopolymers aid in increasing the surface area available to kill the germs, thus increasing the ability of the wound to absorb drug more effectively. New nanoscience-based prevention, detection, and treatment technologies could substantially reduce death and suffering from cancer and other deadly illnesses (National Cancer Institite 2017). Nanomedicine covers a range of uses, including nanomaterials, nanoelectronic biosensors, and molecular nanotechnology (Tan et al. 2016). Sunscreens provide protection from UVA and UVB rays without leaving a white residue on the skin (Lohani et al. 2014). An article “Cosmeceuticals market to 2018” projected that the worldwide cosmeceutical market will get to $42.4 billion by 2018 (Lohani et al. 2014; GBI Research 2013). Cosmetic products that have been successfully used are moisturizer, anti-wrinkle and antiaging creams, and face mask (Khezri et al. 2018). A large number of patents have been filed in this domain, and the income generated out of these market products has been bountiful. 4. In fabric protection, safeguarding wood, paints, and varnishes: Nanoparticles act as protective shield in fabrics against microorganisms and flammability and robustness against ultraviolet radiation (Rivero et al. 2015). Clothing that protects against toxins and pathogens (Bajpai et  al. 2018; Rivero et  al. 2015; Guardian 2014, February 14), seaweed capped zinc oxide nanoparticles having antibacterial and UV protection have been made having antibacterial and UV protection have been made (Pandimurugan and Thambidurai 2017). Nanotechnology-based protective coatings on wood have antimicrobial (Teng et al. 2018), fire-resistant, and chemical-resistant properties saving time, effort, and money. Paints and varnishes avert corrosion and microbial expansion as well as provide insulation (AZo Nano 2017). 5. Areas where nanotechnology has left an indelible mark: High-memory density devices are capable of storing the entire Library of Congress collection on a device of the size of a sugar cube. It improves banknote security with polymer- based ferroelectric memory (Nano Werk 2013). Nanomaterials enhance definite mechanical, physical, and chemical properties in addition to serving as carriers for some active substances, for instance, antioxidants and antimicrobial agents (Amirabad et al. 2018). 6. Electronics and energy sector: It aids in making integrated circuits with features that can be measured on nanometer (nm) scale, thus allowing companies to manufacture computer chips containing billions of transistors that are smaller, cheaper, and faster therefore consuming less power. Currently, flash memory manufacturers use nanolithographics to assemble memory chips as small as 20  nm (UnderstandingNano 2013). Nanotechnology develops clean, inexpensive, renewable power through energy creation, storage, and transmission technologies (Eureka 2018). Energy-efficient, low-emission systems help in reducing energy emissions (Abdin et al. 2018). Nanomaterials as catalyst in cost-effective chemical manufacturing save energy and minimize waste products (Boysen and\nN. Raina et al.\n279\nMuir 2011). Using nanoparticles in soap makes it work better while producing environmentally less harmful by-products. It is moreover being related to oil and gas withdrawal using nanotechnology- empowered gas lift valves in seaward activities or to the application of nanoparticles to sense infinitesimal down-well oil pipeline breaks (National Nanotechnology Initiative 2012). Applied nanotechnology enhances the functionality of traditional construction materials, reduces material carbon emissions, and increases infrastructure durability in addition to numerous other benefits bestowed by nanoscience technology (Oke et al. 2017)."

Energy is possibly influenced in a countless number of means by the spur of nanotechnology which thus has the chance to contribute in several ways to the heterogeneous array of hurdles in this sphere (Ramsden 2018). Replacing leading non-renewable energy sources by renewable forms of energy depends on the expansion of competent technologies. In consistent with prediction by the International Energy Agency (IEA), it will escalate from currently approximately 12,000 MTOE up to more than 18,000 MTOE till 2030 (Luther et al. 2015). Going by the current speed, the yearly consumption of energy will be twice of the present demand (Ampelli et al. 2014) by the year 2050 (Pandey 2018). It has thus established as the mainstream and cost-competitive technology in the renewable energy arena. Renewable energy sources, for instance, solar power, hydropower, bioenergy, and geothermal power/heat, have not remained untouched by the spur of nanotechnology boom. Especially, nanomaterials are progressively playing a dynamic role either by enhancing the efficiency of the energy storage system and conversion route or by upgrading the device design and performance (Chen et al. 2015)."

      "text" : "Energy from sun is a paramount renewable energy source. Since the sun is a changeable energy source which produces energy in a diffused form, therefore organizing incident solar radiations is not an easy task. Given that the solar energy is completely\n15 Efficiency Enhancement of Renewable Energy Systems Using Nanotechnology\n280\nnatural, it is believed to be a clean energy source (Chen 2015). Its creation is quickly becoming an essential source of renewable energy, being evolved as an alternative to conventional supply of energy. Energy sector especially solar energy storage and generation have therefore been significantly benefitted. Decreased manufacturing costs and improved material effectiveness are precisely two of the possible economic advantages that nanotechnology brings to these sectors (Raghav and Dinesh 2016). The most commonly used semiconductor material in generating energy using solar energy is silicon, and some other semiconductor materials are the basic substances of solar energy. At present, roughly 90% of the globally installed solar cells are made using silicon. There are four generations of PV cells which include (a) first-generation crystalline silicon PV (b) second-generation called thin-film PV, (c) third-generation – these are emerging PV, and (d) fourth generation – called high-efficiency PV (single and multi-junction concentrator). Third-generation PV devices are based upon nanocomposites, i.e., nanostructured semiconductors, organic- inorganic hybrid assemblage, as well as molecular assemblies. In addition to these, there is the field of solar thermal energy where the focus is on solar thermal technologies for electricity generation (Ralph Seitz et  al. 2013). Solar thermal energy uses silicon as nanoparticle. Silicon is used in constitution with heavy metal alloys. This segment takes on the application of nanotechnology in the energy-associated processes that deals with the use of radiations from the sun as the source of energy. It can be proficiently used for many practical purposes such as solar cells, solar power plants, solar collectors, seawater desalination, etc. (Hussein 2015). Dye- sensitized solar cells, fuel cells, and solar photovoltaic cells are some other devices under the broad spectrum of systems using solar energy."

      "text" : "In this contemporary period of global awareness for sustainable energy development, countries are searching for viable solutions for energy crisis. Electricity formed from photovoltaic (PV) cells is one such example. These cells allow us to exploit the enormous quantity of energy in the form of radiations that the sun sends toward our planet earth (Wong et al. 2014). A solar photovoltaic cell is a device that converts photons from solar radiations by electrons into electricity (Lewis 2007). By solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity, we mean electricity created through the photovoltaic route, i.e., by the straight conversion of photons from solar radiation into electrical current using semiconductor tools (solar cells). It is a combined physical and chemical phenomenon. However, solar cells are termed photovoltaic whether the supply of light is coming from the sun or an artificial source. The surface of photovoltaics consists of an oxide layer which is conducting and a catalytic platinum layer that straightaway converts light from the sun into electricity. Although, solar energy is abundantly available and is free of cost. Still, just near about 0.04% of the fuel energy out of world’s total primary energy supply is made available by the photovoltaic technology (IEA 2007). Photocatalysis studies are gaining consid-\nN. Raina et al.\n281\nerable attention among researchers these days due to the prospects of higher energy savings and less environmental pollution. Near about 40 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions may be saved per annum, if a distributed solar grid is able to fulfill 1% electricity requirement of the world (Hussein 2015). Also, solar photovoltaic is anticipated to have a lesser LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) compared to coal or natural gas-fired generation world over by 2020 (Bleich and Guimaraes 2016). Among other elements such as silicon or additional material systems like selenium/copper/indium, further development is required in alternative cell types, for instance, polymer solar cells, thin-layer solar cells, or dye solar cells.\nThere are a number of applications making use of energy from sun; photovoltaic (PV) application is the most common one among them. PV market has stretched out considerably since the 1990s. The first-generation PV devices are based upon single or multiple, crystalline p-n junction silicon cells. Presently, PV market is founded on crystalline silicon wafer-based thick solar cells measuring ~150–300 nm. These cells are categorized as the first generation of photovoltaic cells which encompass greater than 86% of the world solar cell market. Current leading market technology, which employs monocrystalline or multicrystalline silicon wafers, scarcely leads to cost decrease through technological development and bulk production. Introducing a thin film layer of 1–2 nm size made of a semiconductor material leads to the introduction of second generation of photovoltaic substances. a-Si has a comparatively higher absorption rate in comparison to crystal silicon making it a viable option for thin film technology in P-V cells. Second generation of solar cells constitutes thin film-based solar cells. The high cost of the conventional photovoltaic cells is the main elementary obstacle to their widespread use. Inkjet printing technology incorporated with devices integrated with particles (e.g., dye-sensitized solar cells or Grätzel cells) present possibly much lower manufacturing price (Bella et al. 2015; Ramsden 2018).\nNanocoatings favor their relevance in PV applications. Multiple reflections thus attained lead to an amplification of the absorption path in turn leading to reduced recombination loss due to decreased absorber layer width. Thus, the energy bandgap of solar cells can be modified. Nanocoatings have valuable self-cleaning features too (Ralph Seitz et al. 2013; Kadırgan 2006). Gold nanoparticles boost the efficiency of PV cells. Fullerenes are widely used as electron acceptors in organic PVs (third generation). Novel fullerene acceptors (e.g., C60 including various organic acceptor materials) are projected to extend to elevated efficiencies. Nanoparticles (e.g., metal particles, metal oxide particles, or carbon-based nanostructures) if added to base fluids like propylene glycol, water, ethylene glycol, etc. augment the thermal conductivity. Crystalline silicon is a brilliant conductor, but it is expensive. The efficiency of energy conversion of roughly 25–30% in a photovoltaic cell is supplied by the crystalline silicon. Alternative conducting materials like titanium oxide are affordable to manufacture. However, in comparison to crystalline silicon, they have even lower conversion efficiency. Nanotechnology can be of immense use in manufacturing complex nanostructured lenses and mirrors to augment collection of solar energy. Aerogels containing nanopores are helpful as thermally insulating and transparent substances to be used as cover materials for solar\n15 Efficiency Enhancement of Renewable Energy Systems Using Nanotechnology\n282\ncollectors. The nanocomposite technology can be seen in numerous energy sector applications and is vital to both energy harvesting and storage market. In siliconbased solar cells, nanocomposites contribute in capturing energy generally in the form of nanowires. Predominantly, nanocomposites can be found in photovoltaic technology (inorganic polymer PV cells or as polymer gel electrolyte in dyesensitized solar cells (DSSC); nanostructured solar cells or quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSC)) (Schueler 2011; Hashim 2011; Kamat 2007). Nanocomposites can also be sited in higher solar transmittance layers on collector glazing (e.g., Ti-Si-O films) and antireflection casing. In solar energy making and transformation, nanocomposites are applied to overcome interaction of electrons and chemicals (catalyst engineering), limits of single materials in solar spectrum (bandgap engineering), and passage of electrons in the material (defect engineering) as well as to trim down prices. These features result in better charge separation and as a result in improved photovoltaic efficiency (Hashim 2011; Kamat 2007)."

      "text" : "PV technology is a combination of conducting polymers or mesoporous metal oxides in addition to an enlarged surface area to augment internal reflections using nanoparticles and therefore makes a solo multi-spectrum layer. One of the economical techniques is to substitute the working fluid with a liquid which includes nanometer- sized molecules called nanofluid. A nanofluid is a colloidal mixture of nanometer-sized substances such as nanofibers, nanotubes, nanoparticles, nanorods, nanowires, or nanosheets in a fluidic system. The base material is a liquid phase, whereas the solid phase contains the nanomaterial. They are used to enhance the heat transfer coefficients, thermal conductivity, viscosity, and diffusivity resulted due to convection. The function of nanotechnology in focusing solar energy like parabolic dish, solar tower, or parabolic trough is because of advanced and novel heat transfer fluids for absorber tubes, e.g., nanocoatings for tubes especially antireflective coatings for collectors (Ralph Seitz et al. 2013). The total market of emerging PV technology involving organic dye cells, CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide) solar cells, and PV cells is expected to jump by 2021 to 7.7 billion US$ illustrating that nanotechnology-based PV market is powerfully associated with the upcoming PV technologies (Ralph Seitz et al. 2013). Better thermal conductivity was reported by Choi in 1995 (Choi et  al. 1995) by using nanofluids on adding nanometer-sized particles to a fluid. According to literature study, the improved thermal conductivity of nanofluids is the chief basis of efficiency rise in solar systems (Raghav and Dinesh 2016). Nanometer-sized electrodes enhance electrical conductivity by lithium inclusion and augment the elevated rate potential. It assists in increasing lithium-ion battery’s capacity, energy and power density, life cycle, and protection. It decreases the specific current density of active elements. It also reduces the volumetric variations and lattice stress and permits high rate of discharge. In case\nN.

As regards cathode, nanostructures are explored frequently as polyanion-based complexes or as transition metal oxides. Nanomaterial cathode electrodes present superior energy storage capacity along with discharge kinetics, superior cyclic stabilities due to an extensive surface area, small distances for mass and charge dispersal, and added liberty for volume alteration along with lithium intercalation and release (Ralph Seitz et al. 2013)."

In this area, indium tin oxide (ITO) commonly used as a transparent electrode can be replaced by several nanoscale materials like metal oxide nanoparticles, CNT, graphene, etc. In solar cells, flat screens, etc., ITO has an additional benefit to be employed as a transparent as well as conductive substance. However, indium is considered as a significant raw material in the solar cell market. Thus, the technologically sound industries are strongly researching for materials in order to substitute indium tin oxide (Ralph Seitz et al. 2013). Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) chiefly put to use nanocoatings, for instance, over transparent (carbon nanotubes/graphene) electrodes (McWilliams 2010). Ductility, wear and tear resistance, and defense against corrosion and erosion are some of the properties bestowed by thermal spray coatings such as chrome oxide, alumina/titania, tungsten carbide, yttria-stabilized zirconia, and nanoceramics (McWilliams 2010). In addition, titanium nanonets containing Li-ion batteries are coated with SiO2 or silicon particles in order to prevent reaction of TiVO2 with Ti+ (Zhou et al. 2011). Ultra-black nanostructured, surface coatings utilized in the solar thermal sector are metal containing nano-sized oxide materials. Solar PV cells are nowadays coated with antireflection surface layer and are known to decrease the surface reflection drastically from 40% to 1% (Ralph Seitz et al. 2013; McWilliams 2010). Metal oxides in solar cells are nowadays substituted by ITO nanoparticles in the medium. Nanocarbon materials (third generation) like carbon nanotubes and graphene are used to enhance the counter electrodes in dyesensitized solar cells by substituting platinum. The effectiveness of photovoltaic cells can be enhanced drastically by employing an intermediary band in between the conduction band and the valence band within the semiconductor. In this manner, energy levels which don’t get placed in the energy bandgap can still be absorbed and converted into current. To achieve desired properties, the energy levels/bandgap of the semiconductor may be reframed by constructing quantum dots to be used in solar cells. Hybrid solar cells (organic-inorganic cell structures) use ZnO nanostructures as electron acceptors. Bad light absorption in thin-film solar cell absorption layers can be resolved by plasmonic metal nanoparticles that use light-scattering\n15 Efficiency Enhancement of Renewable Energy Systems Using Nanotechnology\n284\nand absorption-enhancing layer. Solar cells having nanoparticles made of gold embedded in the plasmonic layer are projected to boost absorption and therefore the efficiency of the cell.\nNanostructures, such as quantum dots, optimally regulate bandgaps of semiconductors to the incident light radiation or emit numerous charge carriers per photon, thus enhancing conversion efficiency. Also this results in better light entrapment, for instance, by averting reflection loss at the front cover from nanostructured antireflection layers or by up- or down-conversion of light wave lengths via special nanostructures, which could facilitate better exploitation of the light spectrum.\nThe phenomenon of solar thermal (conversion of solar energy into heat such as steam and power generation) is commonly used to provide decentralized heat supply in buildings through roof-mounted solar collectors by using parabolic mirrors. The impact of nanotechnology is evident in spheres such as anti-reflection coatings for enhanced energy produce, optimized phase-change stores, and heat exchangers/ carbide layers of collectors, which expand energy incorporation plus thermal and mechanical stability.\nContrary to the silicon wafer technology, thin-layer solar cells provide possibility for savings in the solar cell manufacturing because of material savings, lowtemperature procedures, integrated cell insulation, and an elevated mechanization level in series production. Besides silicon, combination of elements such as copper/ indium/gallium/sulfur/selenium (CIGS cells) as well as III–V semiconductors (e.g., gallium arsenide) is employed, which allow productivity of up to about 20% (Luther et al. 2015).\nDifferent solar cell types can be summarized as below."

Thus, this combines a dye sensitizer (light absorbing matter) by using wide bandgap semiconductor (made up of a nanocrystalline structure) as the photo anode enabling the process of optical absorption and charge separation (Fig. 15.5).

In addition to pure hydrogen, natural gas, methanol, benzene, or biogas may be utilized to run fuel cells. Hydrogen is not as such an energy source but the carrier of atomic energy. Hydrogen fuel cell technologies transpired as the\n15 Efficiency Enhancement of Renewable Energy Systems Using Nanotechnology\n288\ntop promising solutions to sustainable energy and environment (“Bud” Peterson et al. 2010). Nanocoatings as titanium-coated nanotubes are used in hydrogen tanks (Ralph Seitz et al. 2013).\nIn a typical fuel cell, the union of hydrogen (Fig. 15.7) and oxygen molecules produces water. In this process, heat and electricity are released as by-products. This process takes place in an environment-friendly manner, without the release of any detrimental carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, fuel cells can also be produced using methane and methanol. Operability concerns, high cost, and resilience issues are some of the issues if using fuel cells in spite of their enormous utility. Nanotechnology comes to the rescue of fuel cells by resolving some of their limitations. Fuel cells, catalysts, and electrode membranes may be constructed by incorporating nanomaterials. One of the most proficient applications of nanotechnology in the hydrogen energy sector is concerned to the economical storage of hydrogen fuel since storing large volumes of hydrogen fuel is either highly priced or too immense. Nanoblades have been discovered by scientists to be having the capacity of possibly holding huge volumes of hydrogen fuel (G. 2008). In addition to this, it has the possibility of being put inside a nanomaterial, for instance, carbon nanofibers and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (Matteo et al. 2012; Ye et al. 1999; Züttel et al. 2002; Nikitin et al. 2008; Gao et al. 2001; Danilov et al. 2008). These days, carbon nanotube fuel cells are being used to collect hydrogen gas which is considered to be environmentally safe. Since hydrogen gas has the best energy-to-weight ratio in comparison to any other fuel, therefore hydrogen energy is still being used widely in the space vehicles (Hussein 2015). Nanocomposite technology has a high potential to be used in devices for carbon dioxide conversion to hydrocarbon fuels like methanol (Kamat 2007), and nanocomposite sheets make available fresh type of merged hybrid device (Ducharme 2009; Pushparaj et al. 2007).\nN.

This has augmented the ability of the modified fuel cell in comparison to conventional fuel cell with a nafion membrane predominantly at elevated temperatures (Abbaraju et  al. 2008). Using photocatalysis, nanotechnology could be used as a probable tool for the economic production of hydrogen gas using solar energy in an environmentally friendly, clean, and economical manner (Jang et al. 2008). In fuel cells, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) due to their large surface area and thermal conductivity can be inducted into their components and in electro catalyst support system to upgrade its functioning and cut down its cost (Hussein 2015; Zhang et al. 2011)."

Also, the wind is linked to the presence of sun; so long as the sun shines on this planet, the wind subsists on this planet. World wind power market is evaluated at approximately 27 bn $ (billion USD) (Luther et al. 2015).

This process goes on consecutively every day, thus making energy driven from tidal waves a prominent resource of renewable energy (Gillett 2002). Wave- powered devices obtain energy from the surface motion of ocean waves or from pressure oscillations below the surface.\nUsually, energy from water may be regarded as a major resource of renewable energy due to some rational causes. One reason is that slightly more than two-thirds of the land area of the surface of the earth is surrounded with water. The other is that the world is capable of producing approximately 10,000–15,000TWh wave energy on an annual basis. The energy derived from sea waves can be utilized for producing hydrogen.

      "text" : "Human activities are known to affect the quality of potable water. Any water whose quality has been degraded due to human use is wastewater. Wastewater is basically the water that has been already used for domestic purposes, industrial use and commercial or agricultural activities. It can also be a result of run off from surface or storm water or may be inflow from sewer and/or sewer infiltration. Wastewater characteristics depend on its source. Wastewater can be classified as – domestic, municipal and industrial wastewater having its source from households, communities and industrial activities, respectively. The pollutants present in wastewater can be physical, chemical (both organic and inorganic) or biological in nature.\nThe physical pollutants will mainly include the suspended solids, whereas the chemical pollutants will include heavy metals such as lead; mercury; chromium; soluble organic materials like drugs, fruit sugars, soluble proteins, etc.; insoluble organic materials (ammonia, hydrogen sulphide); and emulsions like paints, adhesives and emulsified oils. Biological pollutants may include yeast surplus (from breweries), tissues, skin, hair (from tanneries), etc.\nThe rapidly increasing industrial growth has led to the formation of huge amount of industrial water loaded with toxic pollutants that are hazardous for the environment as well as human health. Industrial wastewater is one of the most important sources of water pollution (Sethi 2018). In this book chapter, we will primarily focus on industrial wastewater. There are a number of industrial activities that are\nS. Maity · D. Sinha National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India\nA. Sarkar (*) Department of Biotechnology & Medical engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India e-mail: sarkara@nitrkl.ac.in\n300\nresponsible for generating industrial wastewater. Some of them include industrial site drainage, cooling waters used in industries such as heat slime, industrial processing waters, water used in hydraulic fracturing, emulsions from paper mills, etc. Battery manufacturing units release heavy metals such as cadmium, chromium, mercury and lead along with oil, grease, silver and zinc. The pollutants discharged by organic chemical manufacturers differ from plant to plant depending upon the variety of products produced. The most common organic compounds released from these units include benzene, chloroform, naphthalene, phenols, toluene and vinyl chloride (Ebrahiem et al. 2017). They may also release metal pollutants like chromium, copper, lead, nickel and zinc. Electric power plants particularly coal-based power stations release metals like mercury, cadmium and lead as well as compounds of nitrogen, arsenic and selenium of significant levels. At times, the wastewater stream may contain fly ash, bottom ash and flue gas (which are transferred from the polluted air to water via means of wet scrubbers). Food processing units may contain certain dissolved organic matter along with high loads of particulate matter and some surfactants (Britz et al. 2006). The cooling waters of iron and steel industries are contaminated with ammonia, cyanide, benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, phenols, cresols and complex organic compounds collectively known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Pollutants in the wastewater may also include hydraulic oils, tallow and even particulate solids. Discharges from paper and pulp manufacturing units include dioxins, furans and phenols. Apart from these, the discharged water also contained lots of sugars and lignocelluloses. Textile dyeing industries effluents contain synthetic and natural dyestuff, guar, wetting agents and dyes (Robinson et al. 2001). Effluents from soap and detergent industries contain complex chemicals, and they also had high levels of zinc and iron in them along with oil and grease. Thus, the industrial wastewater was treated using methods such as dissolved air floatation, chemical coagulation and finally activated sludge process.\nThe characteristics of effluents generated from different industries and manufacturing units differ and so do their treatment technologies. Thus, many treatment technologies had been designed and developed in the past for removal of pollutants from industrial wastewater such as distillation, adsorption, chemical immobilization, aerated lagoons and so on. The characteristics of oil (droplet size, suspension state) are very important to effectively remove it from wastewater. API separators and hydrocyclones can be used in many industries to remove oil. For removal of biodegradable organic materials, methods such as trickling bed filter or activated sludge process were used. If wastewater contains synthetic organic compounds (from paint factories or pharmaceuticals), the advanced oxidation processing, distillation and vitrification can be applied. For wastewaters rich in acids and alkalis, neutralization is the preferred method of treatment. With modernization the type of waste being generated is changing day by day, and so the treatment technologies need to be advanced and efficient enough to effectively remove contaminants from wastewater. Advanced wastewater treatment is comprised of several processes such as reverse osmosis, membrane filtration, chemical coagulation and chemical precipitation depending upon the particular type of effluent produced by the respective industry. Earlier the conventional methods mainly aimed at removing the suspended\nS. Maity et al.\n301\nmaterials present in wastewater and treatment of organic pollutants in it. Recently the focus has shifted to other important contaminants in wastewater such as dissolved solids, heavy metals, toxicants, volatile compounds, solvents, radioactive wastes, etc. so that finally the discharged water after proper treatment can be reused for some other purpose and should not have any negative effect on human health or on the ecosystem.\nWastewater treatment involving traditional methods has become increasingly challenged due to the identification of various other contaminants, rapid population growth and increasing industrial activities. Thus the need for switching toward advanced treatment technologies is the need of the hour, which can remove various probable harmful organic or inorganic compounds or microbial contaminants that cannot be removed effectively and efficiently by using conventional treatment processes. Advanced treatment processes include membrane filtration, nanotechnology, advanced photo-oxidation process, automatic variable filtration (AVF) technology, microbial fuel cells, natural treatment systems, coke oven by-product treatment and many more."

Most of the industries and manufacturing units produce wastewater which has to be treated to reduce the pollutant load in water. This water after treatment can be reused for some other purposes or if released into the environment will have less chances of pollution. Industrial wastewater treatment includes numerous processes that render the wastewater (an undesirable by-product of industries) less polluting. The treatment technology to be used depends on a lot of factors, such as  – composition of the wastewater, type of pollutants in the wastewater, operation costs, etc. The wastewater from textile industries contains impurities that are present in suspended form. They are first coagulated and precipitated in order to generate micro-flocs, and then these micro-flocs were removed by filtration. For removal of COD and colour, simple aerobic treatment is carried out. The dyes present in the wastewater are very difficult to treat by this method because they are organic molecules which are recalcitrant. Hence, they show resistance to aerobic treatment. For colour removal, the technologies developed are classified as physical, chemical and biological (Robinson et al. 2001). The most preferred wastewater treatment technology is biological treatment because it is economical when compared to other methods. Biological treatment methods include fungal decolouration, microbial degradation and adsorption by microbial biomass. Chemical methods involve coagulation, flocculation, floatation, filtration, electro-floatation, electro-kinetic coagulation, conventional oxidation and electrochemical processes. Out of all the existing physical methods,\n16 Wastewater and Industrial Effluent Treatment by Using Nanotechnology\n302\nadsorption is the most preferred method because it does not form any harmful substance. The spent grains released by the breweries usually undergo membrane filtration. Highly suspended solids, bleaching agents and solvents released from paper and pulp industries are subjected to adsorption, sedimentation chemical coagulation, reverse osmosis and advanced coagulation.\nThe wastewater from food industries contains surfactants, dissolved organic matter and particulate load which are treated by dissolved air floatation and gravity oil separators (Britz et al. 2006). Activated sludge treatment method is used to remove oestrogenic hormones that are given out in wastewater from pharmaceutical industries. For most of the biodegradable organic wastes present in wastewater, either activated sludge treatment or trickling bed filter method is used. Heavy metals like iron, lead and zinc, paints and cyanide can be removed by ion exchange or by chemical precipitation. Advanced oxidation process is usually used to treat industrial effluents where they transform toxic organic compounds into biodegradable substances. It is used for treatment of synthetic organic materials like solvents, paints, etc. It can also be used to remove micro-pollutants from wastewater. At times sonolysis has been used to remove chemical contaminants from wastewater which involves acoustic cavitation (Shah 2016). The most widely used adsorbent is activated carbon due to its extensive micro-porous structure and high surface reactivity and adsorption capacity. Membrane separation technologies are used to remove dyes and paints from wastewaters. Simple sedimentation techniques are used to remove most of the solids present in industrial wastewater with the solids obtained as slurry or may be sludge. Oils that float in the industrial effluent can be removed via skimming devices, which is a cheap and dependable method to remove oil, grease and hydrocarbon from wastewater. The effluents from the dairy industry include dissolved sugars and proteins, fats and other additive residues, and it may also contain pathogens from production processes (Britz et al. 2006). The colour and odour from dairy wastewater can be removed by activated carbon treatment. Fats, oils and grease can be removed using enzymatic hydrolysis (Cammarota et al. 2001).\nThe application of traditional and conventional methods of treatment to industrial wastewater is becoming a challenging task since the type and nature of contaminants in the wastewater are changing day by day, and thus their effectiveness and efficiency have become restricted. Thus, new technologies for treatment of industrial effluents must be developed that will have satisfactory efficiency in removing pollutants from wastewater."

The most important nanosorbent for wastewater treatment is carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which is used to treat heavy metals like lead, copper, zinc and cadmium and also organic compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Chen et al. 2007; Li et al. 2003; Lu et al. 2006). Metal-based nanosorbent mainly metal oxides like titanium dioxide, alumina and iron oxide are used for the treatment of heavy metals like lead, mercury, chromium, arsenic, etc. (Sharma et al. 2009).

Devices having different functions are being manufactured using various techniques depending on chemical attractions and can be used for variety of applications rather than the expensive and complex processes previously used to etch electronic circuits (Rakshit et al. 2004; Venere 2005). Molecules might be able to complement or supplement silicon, and in today’s world, instead of traditional electronic components, various devices such as computers, sensors, and so on can use molecules, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins.

      "text" : "One of the major challenges in developing molecular electronics is the better understanding of how electricity is transferred between silicon contacts and molecules in a circuit (Rakshit et al. 2004; Venere 2005). On August 12, 2005, issue of Physical Review Letters, scientists at Purdue University (West Lafayette, IN) reported that they had designed a nanotech simulation tool that explains the flow of current between individual molecules and silicon atoms so that researchers will be able to fabricate “molecular electronic” devices for advanced sensors and future computers (Venere 2005). According to them, this will help the researchers to precisely analyze the changes in electrical conductivity by employing this new simulation tool. These changes in electrical conductivity depend on how molecules are linked to silicon, information that is highly critical for designing the devices properly. In order to show the flow of current, they have used the tool called buckminsterfullerenes, or “buckyballs,” named after architect R. Buckminster Fuller. A buckyball molecule, shown in Fig. 17.2, consists of 60 carbon atoms and is a soccer-ball-shaped molecule with a width of about 1 nm, which is approximately 10 atoms wide. They have predicted the flow of electricity for the three ways in which buckyballs and silicon can be connected. Figure 17.1 shows the geometrical structures with the experimental and theoretical results of all the three scenarios. In the first scenario, there is no chemical bond, and the buckyball is simply sitting on top of the silicon as shown in Fig. 17.1a. In the next scenario (Fig. 17.1b), heating or annealing of silicon has been done in order to connect the molecule to the silicon. And in the third scenario, a natural defect subsisting in silicon has been considered in which the buckyball is resting inside a tiny pit, as shown in Fig. 17.1c. This model precisely plotted the conduction and voltage changes in the three types of connections, and it was seen that the predictions agreed with actual data obtained by the experiments performed by different researchers in laboratories for measuring the current flow alterations (Liang and Ghosh 2005).\nBuckyballs are also being explored for improving the (magnetic resonance imaging) MRI’s ability for the detection of brain tumors. They can also be employed for destroying these tumor cells by delivering the payloads of radiation. Experiments on rats have been performed and have shown the MRI detection sensitivity has been increased by at least 40-fold with the buckyballs being packed with MRI contrast metal gadolinium. A modified version of buckyballs utilizing a fluorescent metal atom called terbium has also been created by the scientists for guiding the surgeons in removing the tumors with high precision and for those cancer cells that have been missed by surgeons; another metal named lutetium can be added that can provide a lethal dose of radiation to these cells. For the successful testing in humans, this research still requires few more years (Amiji 2008). The “buckyball” concept is now almost over a decade old and has created much excitement among the researchers because of its potential in different applications, but as a commercial product, it is still in its infancy. Another geometry similar to buckyballs but tubular in shape came into existence in 1991 by a Japanese physicist “Sumio Iijima” and has more practical implementations than buckyballs (ETHW 2017). Such tubular\nS. Gupta et al.\n317\nstructures, known as nanotubes, consist of carbon atoms or molecules in the form of tubes or even tubes-within-tubes. Due to the hollow-shaped geometries of both the balls and tubes, as shown in Fig. 17.2, they can be used for drug-delivery application, as carriers for drugs or other chemicals. These structures made of carbon atoms have also found applications in the field of electronics for demonstrating the various electronics components such as transistors, tiny wires, etc. (ETHW 2015). Nanotubes have been added to the batteries in order to increase their surface area, and light-emitting nanotubes are being used in the field of telecommunication. Further, nanotubes are also being used for interacting with nerve cells by sending signals to them."

Nanotubes have gained much fame due to their versatile properties and have considered as one among the\n17 Biomolecular and Cellular Manipulation and Detection (Nanofluidics and Micro…\n318\nmost versatile materials ever discovered. They can be cylindrical in shape with open ends or can be a close-ended geometry as shown in Fig.  17.2b, c, respectively. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have high strength and density features when compared to steel, are better conductors than copper, can be used as a replacement of silicon in semiconductor chip industry, and can serve as a surface for the growth of cells, if deposited on transparent plastic in the form of thin films. Due to these remarkable characteristics, nanotubes have found applications in almost every field ranging from designing the elevator cables to lift the payloads into Earth orbit to the miniaturized computers or chips that are even smaller than human cells. In May 2006, the researchers at Rice University and University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) highlighted the electrical interface capability of nanotube films between various biomedical instruments or prosthetic devices and living tissues, in a paper published in Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (Liopo et al. 2006). They have reported that the electrical communication between these two entities has been\nS. Gupta et al.\n319\nmade possible through a transparent conductive layer designed by them by stimulating the cells. Neurons that had been cultured from experimental rats and neuroblastoma cells mainly utilized in test-tube experiments are the two different cell types employed by the researchers’ group in their experiments. Both the types of cells have been placed on single-walled carbon nanotubes’ (SWNTs) mats seeded on flexible transparent plastic sheets and having the thickness equivalent to ten layers. An important neural protein has been absorbed by the nanotubes forming a roughly textured carpet for the readily growth of nerves on them. Through these SWNTs, electrical pulses were transmitted and individual cells’ responses were recorded by a miniaturized electrode located next to these cells using a microscope. The researchers have also studied the effect of various types of SWNTs on the development and growth of neuroblastoma cells. They have compared the cells that were cultured on unaltered native CNTs and using traditional tissue culture plastic to the cells that were placed on functionalized SWNTs’ mats. Functionalization of SWNTs indicates adhering of the surfaces of CNTs with additional molecules in order to improve the CNTs’ electrical properties for proper growth of cells. It was seen that native CNTs resulted in better attachment of neuron and supports the growth well. Next step in the research is to make the attachment of neurons better so that they can communicate in an improved manner leading to superior biocompatibility of these surfaces. This can be done by finding an updated way of functionalizing the nanotubes (Liopo et al. 2006; Bourzac 2006).\nIf CNTs are able to record the continuing electrical activity in cells with high sensitivity, then a device for performing the things like prosthetic control can be designed using them to both deliver and sense stimuli to the cells (Jain 2013). Thus, nanotubes are a good hope for stimulating or replacing the damaged or missing nerve cells in the spinal cord, brain, and eye. Cochlear implant in the people with severe hearing disability is one of the practically implemented applications of neural prosthetics. In this, the electrodes are utilized that can respond to the sound and can transmit the electrical signals directly to the disabled person’s brain. Retinal prosthetic concept has also gained much popularity which will help restore the vision of blind people (Bourzac 2006).\nIn 2016, Usmani et al. in their study have shown that CNTs have the potential as a nervous system prosthesis and can support nerve fiber growth (Usmani et  al. 2016). Thus, they can provide a functional reconnection and help in bridging the segregated neural explants. Biocompatible material has been used for in vivo applications, and its implantation in the small rodents’ brain has not caused large scars and, thus, did not result in a noticeable immune response unlike the traditional electrodes that caused scarring and inflammation (Amiji 2008)."

In March 2005, researchers from University of California, Los Angeles, USA, and Nanomix, Inc., USA, reported the demonstration of an intact biological system interaction with a nanoelectronic device for the first time claiming that this achievement could ultimately be helpful in an artificial eye creation (Artukovic et al. 2005). They tried to overcome the issue of complex hierarchy in biosystems, as organisms are made up of multiple cells and cell membranes comprise tiny objects such as individual proteins located at different distances, by maintaining the interaction of individual nanotubes with individual proteins and interaction of nanotube networks with multiple cell membranes. They had utilized a field-effect transistor (FET) made up of nanotube network with the cell membrane of a bacterium named Halobacterium salinarum (Liz Kalaugher 2005). Bacteriorhodopsin, a protein having a light-sensitive membrane, was present in the cell membrane, and metal electrodes’ connected dense network of CNTs was at the heart of the transistor. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique had been employed for growing the CNT network FET onto a substrate, and the cell membrane was deposited on this substrate for connecting the components. A silicon chip was then placed on top of a 5-nm-thick cell membrane layer, and rhodopsin dipoles’ orientation in the membrane layer was altered by applying an electrical potential to the upper chip. The electrical properties of FET were tested with the different orientations of neighboring dipoles, and it was seen that bacteriorhodopsin’s electric dipole remained intact and FET operation was retained. Transfer characteristics of FET had shown that bacteriorhodopsin’s dipole lies about two-thirds of the way from the exterior of the cell to the inside of the membrane. In order to calculate the effect of this dipole on nanotubes, a simple electrostatic model as shown in Fig. 17.3a was used by the researchers. In this model, rhodopsin molecules form a constant dipole density line above a nanotube and with density equivalent to “π”; a charge density denoted by “λ = −rπ/d2” has been induced by the line of dipoles as mentioned in Fig. 17.3b. Thus, with the knowledge of both the dipole-moment of bacteriorhodopsin and the induced charge, one can calculate the distance of dipoles from the nanotubes. Conclusively, the researchers have successfully demonstrated that it is possible to directly connect the living cells with the nanoelectronic devices and such nanodevices can be used as an investigative tool in various applications (Bradley et al. 2005).\nFurther, the response of such electronic device can be utilized to understand various crucial aspects of the biological system like the distribution of charge within the proteins and so on. The scientists have justified their vision of an artificial eye in which the photon-to-electron conversion is required and which can be achieved by using a light-absorbing molecular layer coupled to neurons attached to an electronic device. These nanoelectronic devices also have the potential to directly connect and manipulate living cells leading to the possibility of detection and modification of different bioprocesses at the cellular level. Thus, nanobioelectronics can achieve the breakthroughs in the field of “cellectronics” (Liz Kalaugher 2005).\nS. Gupta et al.\n321"

The results can be read and interpreted from the chip instantly, thus will help in expediting the drug development.\nThe technique of growing the living cells on a transistor array is better than the traditional methods in which the cells need to be destroyed in order to analyze their\n17 Biomolecular and Cellular Manipulation and Detection (Nanofluidics and Micro…\n322\ninner workings. For example, a patch-clamp electrode is required to facilitate the interpretation of movement results of ion stream into and out of the cell while analyzing the consequences of different drugs on a cell’s serotonin levels. This technique of using patch-clamp electrode will gradually kill and destroy the cell, and thus the sample can be used only up to a few hours. Contrastingly, the method employed by Max Planck researchers maintains the usefulness of sample and celltransistor interface as long as nutrients are provided to the cell. In this technique, firstly the transistor gate is located which has been placed on each living cell directly below the serotonin receptors, and when the serotonin is passed through the receptor’s ion channel, the voltage potential at the gate of the transistor is varied (John Wiley & Sons 2007; Johnson 2007). Then, a computer-controlled monitoring circuitry has been used to record the activity of change in voltage potential which ultimately modulates the transistor’s source-drain current. The researchers finally proved the concept and have evaluated that this interface is able to explain the dosage/effect relationship of various drugs on serotonin and the use of computer control circuitry will automatically lead to the automation of such bioelectronics devices consisting of batteries for drug discovery tests. The next step in their research is to design the general and more-universal test setups and techniques for various applications requiring the harnessing of living cells like detection of different toxins (John Wiley & Sons 2007).\nAccording to scientists, this research, involving studying the electrical interfacing between living cells and semiconductors, will provide a platform for different applications and will be used as a basis for the development and acceleration in the fields of medical prosthetics, neurocomputation, biosensors, and brain research (Johnson 2007)."

In the recent years, nanomedicine (an application of nanobiotechnology) has evolved much by focusing on the development of different types of nanoparticles for drug delivery (Hood 2004; Freitas 2005). Cancer nanomedicine is aiming to cover a wide range of applications from imaging and diagnosing to treating cancers with targeted therapies. Cantilevers, nanopores, nanotubes, quantum dots, nanoshells, dendrimers, nanobombs, and nanowires are some of the tools of nanotechnology having applications in the treatment of different cancers (Pathak and Katiyar 2007; Misra et al. 2010; Azad 2015; Sahoo et al. 2017). Among these, the nanobombs hold great promise as a therapeutic agent for killing cancer cells. An advantage over other carbon nanotube treatments being considered by scientists is that with nanobombs, the nanoparticles injected into the body are also destroyed along with the cancer cells (ScienceDaily 2005; OSUCCC-James 2015). In 2015, researchers at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, USA, have reported the development of nanobombs that can burst after swelling when exposed to nearinfrared (NIR) laser light. These bomb-like nanoparticles might help in overcoming a biological barrier that has blocked the development of agents such as microRNAs required for the outright killing of cancer cells or for stalling their growth. These agents perform these operations by varying the activity, i.e., the expression, of genes in cancer cells (Wang et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2015)."

This exogenous therapeutic low-intensity ultrasound (US) irradiation causes the elevation in temperature, and the endogenous acidic environment around/within tumor results in low pH value. In response to variation in temperature and pH, this dualresponsive system produces and adsorbs the CO2 bubbles due to the presence of L-arginine (LA) and hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticle (HMSN) carriers. Depending upon the increase in temperature and reduction in pH value, CO2 bubbles will be released quickly by a dual-responsive CO2 release system. Then, before dissolution, these bubbles will explode timely as a result of triggering action performed by the therapeutic ultrasound waves. Destruction of blood vessels within panc-1 tumor and instant necrosis of panc-1 cells have been induced by the related bio-effects, such as mechanical effects, cavitation, shock waves, and so on, as a result of the explosion of CO2 bubbles. Consequently, the growth of panc-1 solid tumor will be inhibited and also the normal organs will not be affected much, thereby, minimizing the side effects to these organs.

Quantum mechanical effects are considerably important at nanoscales; thus these nanostructures at such a scale are also known as “quantum wires” (ScienceDaily). The remarkable properties of these nanowires have enabled them to be used in various applications (UnderstandingNano). One such nanowire is molecular nanowire which is designed by repeating the organic or inorganic molecular units. In 2007, researchers at Yale Institute for Nanoscience and Quantum Engineering, USA, published a novel approach for synthesizing the nanowires (YaleUniversity 2007). The integration of these nanostructures directly with the MEMS (microelectronic systems) has been made possible for the first time by this approach. The technique used by the researchers involved the plugging into the biochemical system of cells electronically. A tried-and-true process of wet-etch lithography on silicon-on-insulator wafers available commercially has been used in order to overcome the various hurdles associated with the synthesis of NWs. The nanowires synthesized with this novel technique are structurally stable and have the\nS. Gupta et al.\ncapability of detecting the antibodies or other biomolecules with high sensitivity at affordable costs, thus possessing the potential of revolutionizing the medical diagnostic and therapeutic fields. These NW sensors (Fig. 17.5) with label-free reagents can also sense the live cellular immune response on real-time basis unlike traditional assays which usually takes hours to detect the response of cells of immune system (YaleUniversity 2007). This advancement in nanotechnology has speeded up the diagnostic field as a fully automatic sensor platform for the detection of cellular and molecular arrays can be thought of due to the possibility of seamless integration of this approach with CMOS technology (Stern et al. 2007).\nEnhancements in the development of nanomaterials have made it feasible to directly interconnect the living cells with the external world, thus allowing the probing and manipulation of various biological processes occurring across the cell membranes, inside the whole cells, or between the neighboring cells. These nanostructures can act as interfaces between the outer world and inside body mechanism apart from functioning either at the vicinity of a biomolecule’s surface or inside a cell. In 2007, a report was published in Journal of the American Chemical Society in which the authors have highlighted the signal-carrying ability of silicon nanowires (Si NWs) to the living cells (Kim et al. 2007). They have demonstrated that as the cells grow, Si NWs having dimensions in the range of 1–100 nm can directly penetrate into them without causing any damage. The interface capability of Si NWs for carrying out the transmission of signals will help in connecting the prosthetics to the living tissues electronically and also for developing the biosensors (Kim et al. 2007).\nRapid progression in various fields like nanotechnology, molecular biology, microfluidics, biosensors, VLSI, etc. has empowered the integration of all such processes on a single platform for POC (point-of-care) detection and management of various diseases so as to pacify their consequences and to prevent the situations of epidemics and pandemics. Lab-on-chip is one of the state-of-the-art technologies that have been developed owing to the possibility of easy integration of all the above mentioned interdisciplinary fields (Gupta et  al. 2016). Further, current\n328\nresearch scenario has entered into an era where collaboration of these diversified fields has made it feasible to mimic a whole organ on a chip.

The size of this chip ranges from millimeters to a few square centimeters (Volpatti and Yetisen 2014).\nLoC technology has several advantages compared with conventional techniques such as minimal sample requirement, rapid analysis time, ease of use, minimized exposure to hazardous materials, and reduced waste generation (Soutter 2019). LoCs are capable of analyzing metabolites, molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, cells, and viruses. It can perform fluidic processes, sensing, analysis, and separation of biochemical samples.

      "text" : "In today’s contemporary manufacturing industry, there is rising demand of high productivity with low cost along with improved quality. In order to achieve the present production rate demand and challenge of cost competitiveness across the global markets, material removal rate should be enhanced. Increased material removal rate demands higher values of cutting parameters, i.e. speed, depth of cut and feed rate, which carry a great risk of tool wear and failure due to enormous heat generation and friction at cutting zone between chip and tool (Bruni et al. 2006). Plastic deformation also tends to deteriorate the surface integrity which is an important property in evaluation of productivity of machining processes (Davim et  al. 2008). Chip flowing over the tool surface tends to carry the major portion of heat, and some portion is conducted by tool itself; thus reducing the temperature at cutting zone will largely enhance tool life and surface integrity and reduce tool deterioration (Dudzinski et al. 2004). Thus cutting fluids in modern industry act as an accessory in reducing the shear zone temperature by reducing chip tool contact length and improving the thermal conductivity at interface which greatly optimizes the cutting parameters and improved tool life (Vieira et al. 2001). Primary function of cutting fluid used in conventional machining is to simultaneously cool and lubricate the cutting zone thereby decreasing the coefficient of friction which in turn reduces the cutting forces required for conventional machining operations like turning, drilling, milling and grinding (Adler et al. 2006).\nHowever issues related to excessive and conventional use of mineral oil-based cutting fluids have been debated by the researchers lately which involves disposal of toxic mineral oils in soil and water, and improper handling of mineral oil-based\nR.

Raina School of Mechanical Engineering, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu & Kashmir, India\n334\ncutting by machine operators may cause various health hazards and results in degradation of health of the operator (Soković and Mijanović 2001). Shashidhara and Jayaram (2010) estimated 80% of total health problems are caused due to mineral oil-based cutting fluids. Purchasing cost of cutting fluids includes 7–17% of total machining cost (Klocke and Eisenblätter 1997). European Union almost consumes annually 320  Mt of cutting fluids during machining processes out of which two thirds of used fluid has to be disposed (Lawal et al. 2013). Shokrani et al. (2012) estimated non-biodegradable mineral oil-based cutting fluid increases disposal cost fourfold the purchasing cost which also includes physical and chemical treatment cost required before disposing them.\nDue to increased disposal, treatment cost and health and environmental problems, researchers are now investing their interest discovering biodegradable vegetable and esoteric oil (Tschätsch and Reichelt 2009). These vegetable and ester oils have biodegradability of 90–95% and have environmental compatibility in terms of biodegradability, toxicity, safe disposal and additives (Kodali and Nivens 2001; Pop et al. 2008). These vegetable oils provide a vast range of rheological properties in terms of flash point, viscosity index and low volatility. Debnath et al. (2014) listed out detailed developments in biodegradable vegetable-based cutting fluids and their influence on cutting parameters along with reduction in ecological and economical complications which were found in mineral oils. Simultaneously researchers are more focused on achieving more clean production by improving the methods cutting fluid applications at cutting zone (Fratila 2009). Dry machining can never be one solution to the problem as it affects tool life badly (Diniz and Micaroni 2002). So more convenient ways of near-dry machining (MQL) are now being adapted to minimize the use of cutting fluids. Sharma et al. (2009) talk about more such lubrication techniques (cryogenic cooling, MQL, flood and high-pressure cooling) during conventional machining processes which lead to clean and sustainable manufacturing. Lawal et al. (2013) in his research compared vegetable oil-based MQL lubrication technique and conventional flood lubrication and concluded that MQL with vegetable oil-based lubrication has better results than other conventional techniques in terms of process parameters and cost.\nWith technological advancements in manufacturing industry, nano-cutting fluids are now being imposed which profitably meet the challenge of heat dissipation during machining by providing stability and improved thermal conductivity to base oil at wide range of temperatures. These nano additives can be classified into metallic, non-metallic and nanofibres with diameter range up to 100 nm which are dispersed in base cutting oil (Chol and Estman 1995). Experimental research (Sharma et al. 2015b, 2016; Su et al. 2016) reveals these nanoparticles dispersed in base oil easily penetrate into cutting zones, and due to their heat extraction and friction reduction properties, they reduce too wear and cutting forces. MWCNT (multiwall carbon nanotubes) (Sharma et al. 2019), Al2O3 (aluminium oxide) (Arumugam et al. 2018), ZnO (zinc oxide) (Battez et  al. 2008) and MoS2 (molybdenum disulphide) (Rajendhran et al. 2018) are some of the nanoparticles which have improved thermal and tribological properties. Due to enhanced machining performance, addition of nanoparticles has minimized the use of cutting fluids, saving the environment and\nR. Anand et al.\n335\ndecreasing the cost of production.

Researches have shown that on reducing the cutting, temperature will increase tool life and reduce the tool wear (Khan and Ahmed 2008). Cutting fluids are thus applied to carry away the heat from the cutting tool and workpiece interface thereby reducing the temperature which is critical for tool wear. 7–17% of the total cost of machining is acquired by the cutting fluid alone (Klocke and Eisenblätter 1997). Several techniques have been developed to increase the efficiency of cutting fluid and enhance the machining process by environmentfriendly means.\nAlong with the improvement in the conventional cooling techniques and reduction in temperature rise, researchers have focused on environmental problems like disposability, toxicity, misting, staining and self-cleanliness involved using cutting fluids."

Cryogenic cooling is an environmentally friendly and efficient way of maintaining a safe working temperature well below the critical or softening temperature of tool (Dhar et al. 2002). Thus reduction in temperature results in reduced flank and crater wear thereby improving the product quality and productivity. Cryogenic cooling is more predominant at lower cutting speed due to more effective penetration of cryogen between chip and tool interface (Khan and Ahmed 2008). Its cooling capability decreases with increase in cutting speed due to obstruction in penetration of cryogen in hot chip tool interface. Turning with carbide inserts with liquid nitrogen cryogenic cooling, it was observed that tool life improves which attributes to reduction in notching, abrasion, adhesion and diffusion type of wear."

Vegetable oils which can be edible and nonedible and which differ in geographical and tropical regions of the world can be used as bio-lubricants. Main emphasis nowadays is laid on nonedible vegetable oils which are considered as unused crops (Atabani et al. 2013). Principal component of these vegetable oils is triacylglycerols which constitute 98% composition followed by diglycerols and fatty acids (Rudnick 2005). This triglyceride structure is responsible for structural stability and high viscosity at high machining temperatures."

High viscosity measures more resistance to flow, and less viscous lubricant has less resistance to flow (Mobarak et al. 2014). Long carbon chain length, compact branched and saturated structure enhance the viscosity of the oil (Knothe and Steidley 2005; Rudnick 2005). There are various modification techniques through which viscosity of the vegetable oils can be improved to sustain viscous properties at higher machining temperatures. Presence of one double bond will increase the viscosity of oil, whereas presence of two or more double bonds will decrease the viscosity (Rodrigues et  al. 2006). Epoxidized soybean oil possesses high viscosity at extreme cutting temperatures than other vegetable oils (Ting and Chen 2011)."

Generally vegetable oils possess high viscosity index than mineral oils.

Thus lubricants with low flash point are more suitable for machining at low temperatures (Benchaita and Lockwood 1993). If lubricant doesn’t possess low pour point property, the lubricant will cease to flow at low temperature and will increase friction and wear during machining. For most of the vegetable oil pour point is lower than −10 °C which results in poor flow of oil at low temperatures due to bending and continuous stacking of triglyceride structure and formation of macro- crystals (Asadauskas and Erhan 1999; Quinchia et  al. 2012; Rhee et  al. 1995). These crystal structures and strong intermolecular bonding sometimes cease the ability of oil to flow at low temperatures which attributes to loss in kinetic energy due to self- stacking (Erhan et al. 2006). Oils that have more unsaturated fatty chains will have lower pour points; rapeseed oil (−21 °C) has lower pour point than olive oil (−10 °C) due to increased unsaturated fatty chains which restricts the formation of packed crystals during cooling (Gryglewicz et al. 2003)."

A lubricant should possess high oxidative stability as low oxidation stability may lead to polymerization which increases viscosity and degrades the functional properties of lubricant on machining (Asadauskas et  al. 1996; Lal and Carrick 1994; Suda et  al. 2002). Critical factor that influences the oxidation stability is the presence of polyunsaturated compounds in the molecular chains which can easily react with oxygen from oxides, peroxides and acids (Wu et al. 2000). Thus the higher is the unsaturation, the more is the chance of oxidation (Fox and Stachowiak 2007). Removal of β-CH group allows the formation of carboxylic acid which deteriorates the quality of lubricating oil (Zulkifli et al. 2014).\nR.

Two-step method works well with oxide nanoparticles and metallic nanoparticles as well (Manna 2012). Al2O3/water and TiO2/water nanofluids were prepared using two-step method of nanofluid preparation (Chon et al. 2005; Haghighi et al. 2013; Li et al. 2008; Murshed et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2009). Li et al. (2008) using two-step method prepared Cu/water fluid to check the influence of pH value and surfactant addition on thermal conductivity. By two-step method, preparation of nanofluids on mass scale is possible which has already increased the rate production in industries; however problem of transportation and storage cannot be avoided in this process (Yu et al. 2012). Formation of agglomerates due to high surface energy of nanoparticles is also a major disadvantage of two-step method which is further improved by onestep method in preparation of nanofluids (Mohammed et al. 2011).

In this method of preparation, problem of storage and transportation is ward off, and agglomeration of nanoparticles is minimized which enhances the stability of nanoparticles (Li et  al. 2009). In one-step process, nanofluid is directly prepared by physical vapour deposition (PVD) technique or by condensation technique known as VEROS (vacuum evaporation onto a running oil substrate) (Akoh et al. 1978). Eastman et al. (1996) directly dispersed the vapours of condensed metal to nanoparticles in the base fluid thereby modifying the VEROS technique of onestep method. Direct evaporation and condensation of one-step method developed by Choi et  al. (2002) provides enhanced stability and largely controls the size of nanoparticles. Lo et al.

Nanoparticles produced are of polygonal,\n18 Bio-Based Nano-Lubricants for Sustainable Manufacturing\n346\nsquare, circular and needle-like shape. Later on Chang and Kao (Chang and Kao 2007) modified this technique and improved the nanoparticle synthesis both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Stability is hence susceptibility of nanoparticles to agglomerate due to high surface energy which not only blocks microchannels but also influence thermophysical properties like thermal conductivity, density and viscosity with time (Ghadimi et al. 2011). Rate of agglomeration depends on the frequency of collision and probability of cohesion during collision due to Brownian motion. Stability of nanoparticles is the basic requirement for its wide application and utilization. Stability of nanofluids depends on preparation method, type of base fluids, sonication time and added surfactants. Stability is achieved when electrostatic repulsive forces between the nanoparticles are higher than attractive forces (Missana and Adell 2000; Popa et al. 2010). Agglomeration is generally reduced by steric and electrostatic mechanisms. In steric stabilization mechanism, additives like surfactants are added which form a protective layer over the nanoparticle and cease its ability to agglomerate or collide with other nanoparticle (Zhu et al. 2007). In electrostatic stabilization adsorption of ions create an ionic layer over the nanoparticle surface which enhances the repulsive forces between nanoparticles thereby increasing the stability of nanofluid (Mukherjee and Paria 2013) (Fig. 18.2)."

Attempts to reduce the use of cutting fluid in machining are turning out to be a good alternative than flood and dry machining. MQL drilling is found out more promising than dry and wet conditions for low aspect ratio, and with further modifications in supply and cutting fluid, high aspect ratios can be achieved by Mathew and Vijayaraghavan (2017). Nam et al. (2011) studied the characteristics of nanofluid micro-drilling using MQL on aluminium 6061. Varying the concentration of nanodiamonds and type of base fluid, it\nR. Anand et al.\n347\nwas observed that nanodiamond-enriched MQL improves the quality of holes and lubrication which attributes to rolling, ball bearing and cooling characteristics of nanoparticles. Furthermore 1% of nanodiamond was more effective in reduction of torque and thrust forces than 2% of nanodiamond. Huang et al. (2016) analysed the micro-drilling operation with different drilling conditions. It was concluded that applying nanodiamonds in vegetable oil with MQL reduces the machining zone temperature due to improved heat transfer rate by nanoparticles. Application of nanoparticles also reduces the burr around the holes improving the quality of holes. Addition of nanoparticles reduces forces and torque required for drilling thereby improving the tool life of drill. Nam et  al. (2015) conducted 25 experiments by multi-optimization techniques (RSM and GA) and deduced that minimum thrust, and torque forces at high spindle speed were obtained at 2 vol% of nanodiamonds in conventional oil. Considering same parameters (drill diameter, spindle speed, feed direction and concentration), Chai et al. (2016) dispersed MWCNT in hydrogenated oil using surfactants. TEM and FTR results analysis shows increase in thermal conductivity with some abrupt changes at different temperatures. 9.8% increase in thermal conductivity by adding 100 ppm nanoparticles at 50 °C was the highest observed value. Chatha et al. (2016) investigated influence of Al2O3 mixed nanofluid (1.5 vol%) on drilling 6063 aluminium with HSS tool. Addition of nanoparticles showed better machining results in terms of surface roughness, cutting speed and thrust forces as compared to dry, flood and pure MQL conditions due to their enhanced lubricating and cooling characteristics. Furthermore increase in number of holes drilled and reduction in chip contact length were observed with nanofluid MQL machining than dry and pure MQL machining. Garg et al. (2016) performed computational modelling using different techniques (ANFIS and GP), and relation\n18 Bio-Based Nano-Lubricants for Sustainable Manufacturing\n348\nbetween feed rate, drill diameter and MRR was established. For lower values of torque and thrust forces, drill diameter was critical parameter.\nMosleh et  al. (2017) experimentally compared performance of nanodiamond (ND) and molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) in alcohol-based lubricant under extreme pressure test. Results showed that addition of MoS2 increases load-carrying capacity by 16% and increases service life of tool by 25%; on the other hand, dispersion of nanodiamond in base oil reduced the service life and has unfavourable response on tribological and lubrication properties of nanofluid. There is increase in tool life with addition of MoS2 by 25%, while ND mixed nanofluid deteriorates both lubrication and tribological properties. Addition of TiO2 nanoparticles increases heat transfer and lowers the drilling temperature at interface as compared to dry and base fluids (Salimi-Yasar et  al. 2017). Nam and Lee (2018) investigated influence of nanodiamonds in vegetable oil on machinability of titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V). Results showed that nanodiamonds (35 nm) at low feed rate (10 mm) penetrate deep into drilling zones and provide ball-bearing effect which reduces the thrust force and torque required.

Addition of MWCNT improved the surface roughness and microcracks. ANN model developed produces surface roughness close to actual value with minimum error of 0.88–9.3% and hence can be used to record surface finish values before machining.\nVasu and Kumar (2011) experimentally studied the influence of adding Al2O3 nanoparticles with emulsifier as base fluid on machining steel EN-31 workpiece. 20–30% reduction in machining temperature was observed at wheel workpiece interface.

Furthermore ball bearing and\n18 Bio-Based Nano-Lubricants for Sustainable Manufacturing\n352\nrolling mechanisms of nanoparticles effectively enhance lubricating and cooling conditions at cutting zone.\nMao et al. (2013b) also investigated influence of air pressure and nozzle angle during machining with Al2O3 nanofluids. Spraying parameter (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 MPa) pressure with nozzle direction and spraying distance 20, 40 and 60 mm were used experimentally. It was observed that optimized parameters can be obtained with nozzle set at 15° with horizontal than tangential or directly towards wheel.\nPrabhu and Vinayagam (2013) investigated effect of grinding glass with SWCNT using water as base fluid in MQL system of lubrication. Electrolytic process technique (ELID) was used with metal-bonded diamond grinding wheel for machining. Reduction in surface roughness and microcracks from 0.3758 to 0.1791 μm and 2.88 to 1.58 was calculated with atomic force microscopy.\nMao et al. (2013a) concluded that higher concentration (1, 3, 5 vol%) of Al2O3 nanoparticles reduces grinding forces (2.32, 2.19, 2.12 N/mm). It was further investigated that oil-based MoS2 require lower grinding force than water-based nanofluid in MQL-based nanofluid machining.\nLi et al. (2013) studied surface heat generation on the surface of three workpiece (45 steel, 2Cr13, zirconia ceramics) through numerical simulation. Grinding operation was performed under three lubricating conditions: dry, flood cooling and oilbased pure MQL and MQL with CNT nanoparticles. It was observed that CNT nanofluid with MQL effectively reduces the surface temperature than any other mode of lubrication thereby enhancing the surface quality and minimizing the burns on the surface of grinding wheel. Addition of surfactant (SDBS) reduced the chance of agglomeration and enhanced cooling and lubrication properties of the nanofluid.\nJia et al. (2014) experimentally investigated influence of machining with nanofluid of MoS2, PCD (polycrystalline diamond) and ZrO2 nanoparticles using MQL technique. Results were compared with dry, water-based flood cooling, pure MQL using soybean oil and nanoparticle with mixed MQL. It was observed that tangential forces decreased by 45.88% in pure MQL grinding, 62.34% in nanofluid-based MQL and 69.33% in flood grinding. Furthermore it was observed that MoS2 forms a physical layer of molybdenum trioxide on the surface which reduces the loadcarrying capacity at the grinding zone.\nWang et al. (2014) studied the relationship between crack formation and surface morphology of the workpiece (quenched 45 steel) using MoS2 nanofluid-based MQL technique through mathematical model. Bump height reduces with increase in speed and with increase in number of cracks, whereas when a number of cracks reduce with increase in peripheral speed, the bump height increases with increasing crack length. Experimental values were smaller than simulated values which attributes to cooling and lubrication effects of nanoparticles.\nManojKumar and Ghosh (2015) investigated performance of MWCNT mixed nanofluid in machining of AISI 52100 steel using small amount of cutting fluid lubrication (SQL). Results of dry, oil-based flood lubrication, oil-based SQL and nanofluid mixed SQL were compared. It was observed that enhanced thermal conductivity which improved chip morphology and minimum coefficient of friction (0.07) was recorded with 1  vol% of MWCNT.  G-ratio improved with MWCNT\nR. Anand et al.\n353\nnanofluid, and results of surface roughness were comparable with flood lubrication using SQL.\nMao et al. (2014a) performed grinding of AISI 52100 steel with nanofluid using MQL technique. Canola oil as cutting fluid, dry, deionized water, Al2O3 with MQL and MoS2 with MQL were used for experiments. It was observed that MQL with nanofluid due to their rolling and sliding properties at grinding zone reduce the frictional coefficient and grinding forces thereby improving the surface finish of the workpiece than any other mode of lubrication.\nZhang et al. (2015c) compared performance of different lubricating oils (soybean oil, rapeseed oil, palm oil) in grinding 45 steel workpiece using MoS2 (2 wt%) nanofluid-based MQL. Addition of MoS2 in soybean oil enhanced viscosity which further improved lubrication properties of base fluid reducing grinding forces and grinding energy. Adding CNT, MoS2 and ZrO2 nanoparticles at different concentrations, each (1, 2, 3 wt%) (Zhang et al. 2015b) concluded that 2 vol% of CNT showed best cooling effect due to its higher conductivity than any other concentration of nanoparticles. Using same experimental conditions (Zhang et al. 2015a), compared grinding energy of MoS2, CNT and ZrO2 in colza oil as base fluid. MoS2 with jet MQL recorded 32.7% J/mm3 less specific grinding energy than that of CNT and ZrO2.\nZhang et  al. (2016) experimentally investigated the influence of nanofluids (MoS2, CNT, MoS2-CNT) with different concentrations (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 vol%). Increasing the surface roughness resulted in increase in surface roughness value from 2% to 12%. Furthermore lowest G-ratio was observed with MoS2-CNT which attributes to physical collaboration of both nanoparticles in lubrication mechanism.\nSetti et al. (2015) analysed the influence of Al2O3 and CuO nanofluids on machining titanium alloy with MQL technique. Considerable reduction in coefficient of friction and cutting temperature was observed with water-based Al2O3 nanofluid than with CuO-based cutting fluid. Chip morphology also revealed about cooling and antiwear and self-cleaning lotus effect of nanoparticles.\nSinha et  al. (2017) experimentally analysed the performance of nanofluids (Ag, ZnO) while machining Inconel 718 using considerably small amount of cutting fluid using SQL. Significant reduction in grinding forces, wear and small frictional coefficient was recorded with use of ZnO nanoparticle with improved surface finish on machined workpiece. This attributes to better lubricity and spreading ability of ZnO nanoparticles.\nWang et al. (2017b) compared the performance of Al2O3 at different concentrations (0.5–4 vol%) using MQL technique in grinding nickel-based alloy. Minimum contact angle (45°) for maximum lubricity and spreadability was observed at 2  vol%. Best tribological properties of nanofluid were obtained with 2  vol% of Al2O3; increase in concentration reduces the surface quality of workpiece. 24.3% reduction in force ratio and 34.1% reduction in grinding energy than pure MQL has been observed. Wang et  al. (2017a) further added different nanoparticles (MoS2, SiO2, ND, CNT, Al2O3, ZrO2) in palm oil as base fluid. Al2O3 provided best antifriction property by reducing frictional coefficient by 20% and w-ratio by 65%. Improved lubrication properties on addition of nanoparticles attribute to formation\n18 Bio-Based Nano-Lubricants for Sustainable Manufacturing\n354\nof tribofilm and polishing effect at wear zones and sliding surfaces. Li et al. (2017) using same setup and conditions as Wang et al. (2017a) experimentally analysed physical properties of different nanoparticles in grinding nickel alloy. Increase in concentration by volume of nanoparticles (up to 2  vol%) increases thermal heat transfer and viscosity of nanofluid. CNT with 2 vol% concentration records the lowest temperature (108°), and SiO2 records lowest grinding force ratio. Furthermore lower contact angle will improve lubrication effect (Table 18.3)."

      "text" : "Krishna et al. (2010) experimentally studied the influence of mixing nanosolid suspensions of nanoboric acid in coconut oil and SAE-40 oil in machining AISI 1040. Turning operation was conducted on lathe with carbide inserts. It was recorded that flow rate of 10 ml/min and 0.5% concentration of nanoboric acid with coconut oil shows better performance in terms of heat transfer, tool wear and surface finish than nanoboric acid suspension in SAE-40 oil. With increase in concentration (up to 0.5 wt%) of nanoparticles, thermal conductivity increases, and due to reduced friction, there is a reduction in cutting temperature as well.\nYan et al. (2011) on mixing different concentrations of nanosolids MoS2, Cu, CuO (1, 3, 5, 10, 20 wt%) and graphite fibre (0.2, 0.5, 1, 3, 5 wt%) in calcium-based greases in turning of RB-SiC ceramic, established that due to formation of thin tribolayer direct contact between tool and workpiece were significantly reduced. 10 wt% of copper nanoparticles in grease produces best surface finish and minimum tool wear which attributes to higher microplasticity of cu nanoparticles than others.\nKhandekar et  al. (2012) experimentally studied the effect of adding Al2O3 nanoparticles in turning AISI 4340 steel under dry, flood and nano-enriched servocut base fluid. Addition of 1% of Al2O3 enhances wettability of cutting fluid which enhances heat transfer property of cutting fluid. Enhanced heat dissipation and cooling characteristics of nano-enriched cutting fluid reduce cutting forces and tool wear during machining.\nAmrita et  al. (2013) experimentally investigated the influence of adding nanographite at different concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 0.5 wt%) in turning AISI 1040. Cutting fluid was supplied under different conditions of dry, flood and mist (5, 10, 15 ml/min) at different air pressures. With increase in pressure, droplet size of aerosol decreases which enhance lubrication and cooling property of cutting fluid. 15 ml/min and 0.5 wt% of Al2O3 decrease tool wear by 94.04% and 75.24% than dry and flood lubrication, respectively, for carbide tool. 71.92% reduction in tool wear was observed in case of HSS steel tool as compared to flood lubrication. Furthermore 76.25% and 56.98% reduction in cutting forces in case of carbide tool and 84.02% and 77.76% reduction in HSS steel was observed as compared to dry and flood machining.\nSrikiran et al. (2014) investigated the influence of nanographite mixed cutting fluid in machining AISI 1040 steel using carbide insert. Cutting forces increase by\nR.

Anand et al.\n361\n1.08 times when diameter of the nanographite decreased from (70–90  nm) to (5–10 nm) which attributes to increase in frictional resistance due to sliding and sticking phenomenon that increases cutting forces. Smaller size of nanoparticles results in increased surface roughness due to continuous rubbing, increase in temperature and tool chatter which degrades the surface quality of workpiece.\nChan et al. (2013) experimentally studied that surface properties and waviness of the workpiece can be enhanced by 19% and 22% with use of nano-droplet-enriched cutting fluid (NDCF). NDCF reduces the thrust forces by 26% and increases cutting to thrust force ratio reducing viscosity which can further improve surface roughness.\nSaravanakumar et al. (2014) investigated the performance of silver nanoparticlesenriched cutting fluid in turning. It was experimentally observed that with addition of silver nanoparticles, there is reduction in cutting forces by 8.8% and surface roughness by 7.5% as compared to conventional fluids used for machining. Formation of a tribofilm with use of silver nanoparticles reduces the coefficient of friction and tends to increase tool life by bringing down the cutting temperature.\nAmrita et al. (2014a) investigated different parameters in machining AISI1040 steel with uncoated carbide tool on addition of nMoS2 (nano molybdenum sulphide), NBA (nanoboric acid) and FNG (functionalized nanographite). Addition of surfactant (SDBS) enhanced the stability of nanoparticles in base fluid. MQL technique with and without application of nanofluids provided better cutting performance than dry machining. nMoS2-enriched cutting fluid significantly reduces surface roughness, wear and cutting forces compared to other nanofluids. NBA considerably reduces cutting temperature at the machining zone.\nSayuti et al. (2014b) designed his experiments using Taguchi method with different process parameters during turning of AISI 4140 hardened steel using SiO2 nanoparticles. Using fuzzy logic and Taguchi analysis minimum surface roughness and tool wear was achieved by 0.5 wt% of SiO2 at 30° and 60°, respectively. Increase in concentration degrades surface finish and increases tool wear.\nPadmini et al. (2015) mixed nMoS2 and boric acid (H3BO3) in sesame oil and coconut oil separately. The samples were then analysed under different lubricating conditions. Using MQL-based lubrication system with nano enrichment of both MoS2 and boric acid, cutting forces and surface roughness were reduced up to 82% and 37% as compared to dry machining. nMoS2 effectively reduces interface temperature of 37% and 31% in coconut and sesame oil, respectively.\nPadmini et al. (2016) investigated influence of adding nMoS2 in coconut, sesame and canola oil at different concentrations in turning of AISI 1040 steel. It was recorded that 0.5 wt% of MoS2 effectively reduces cutting forces, surface roughness and tool wear by 37%, 39% and 44% as compared to dry machining. Furthermore nMoS2 forms a fullerene-like nanofilm interface which results in reducing coefficient of friction.\nAmrita et al. (2014b) investigated the influence of adding nanographite 0.3 wt% in water-soluble oil. AISI 1040 steel was turned using different lubrication techniques: dry, flood, pure fluid with MQL and nano-enriched cutting fluid, and results were compared experimentally. It was observed that mist application of nanofluid due to formation of fine aerosols enhances the cutting condition by bringing down\n18 Bio-Based Nano-Lubricants for Sustainable Manufacturing\n362\ninterface temperature and reducing the tool wear. 54% reduction in cutting temperature, 25% in tool wear and 71% in surface roughness were observed as compared to flood lubrication.\nGupta et  al. (2016) investigated influence of nMQL during turning in CNC machine using cubic boron nitride inserts. Al2O3, MoS2 and graphite were mixed in vegetable oil for experimentation. After performing 29 experiments and optimization through ANOVA, it was recorded that cutting speed, cooling condition and feed rate contribute 40.20%, 36.50% and 20.13% and are significant parameters. Furthermore it was observed that graphite effectively reduce the cutting temperature as compared to other nanoparticles due to formation of lamellar structure between machining interfaces.\nSu et al. (2016) investigated experimentally the performance of graphite-LB2000 and graphite-PriEco6000 nanofluids under different lubricating conditions. Experiments were conducted on turning AISI 1045 annealed carbon steel with uncoated carbide insert under dry, MQL and MQL with graphite-oil mixture. It was observed that MQL with graphite-enriched LB2000 nanofluid shows better performance than graphite-enriched PriEco6000 in terms of reduction in machining temperature and cutting forces.\nAli et al. (2017) studied influence of surfactant (SDBS w) in nano-enriched mixture of Al2O3 and soluble oil at different concentrations (0.1, 0.4, 0.6  wt%). Increasing the concentration of nanoparticles surface roughness of the workpiece reduces. Feed rate was calculated as most significant factor using ANOVA analysis.\nRaju et al. (2017) investigated the performance of MWCNT (2 vol%) with distilled water. Machining with MWCNT reduces tool wear by 40% and cutting forces by 5–8% in comparison with base fluid and dry machining, respectively. Furthermore presence of nanoparticles reduced the contact angle by 33.33% as compared to conventional fluid which enhances the wear resistance capability of cutting fluid.\nBehera et al. (2017) experimentally compared the spreading coefficient of different surfactants (CTAB, SDS, Tween-20, PVP) on cutting tool surface. Reduction in tangential force (29.72%), coefficient of friction (7.25%) and feed force (19.39%) were observed with Tween-20-NF compared to dry and other surfactant-rich nanomachining. Reduction of about 33.35% in chip tool interface was observed with Tween-20 NF compared to dry environment.\nHegab et al. (2018b) experimentally observed the performance of MWCNT-rich nanofluid on turning titanium alloy by varying cutting speeds. Using ANOVA analysis it was recorded that MWCNT-rich nanofluid gave better results in power consumption and flank wear than base fluid alone. Significant improvement on cutting temperature, cooling and wetting characteristics of base fluid was observed by using MWCNT. Continuing their work Hegab et al. (2018a) studied the effect of turning with nano-enriched cutting fluid on chip morphology and tool wear on machining Inconel 718. MWCNT and Al2O3 have been used to enhance the lubrication properties of base fluid. Less deformation in chip and enhancement in interface bonding of tool and chip were observed which attributes to increase in shear angle and superior cooling characteristics of cutting fluid.\nR. Anand et al.\n363\nSartori et al. (2018) observed the cooling and lubrication characteristics of solid lubricants (graphite and PTFE) using MQL technique on turning Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Reduction in crater and nose wear was observed due to improved dynamic viscosity of solid lubricant-assisted MQL-MQC (Table 18.4)."

      "text" : "Park et al. (2011) experimentally analysed the effect of nano-enhanced lubrication in ball milling AISI 1045 steel workpiece using MQL technique. Nanographene (xGnP) particles were mixed with vegetable oil, and experiment was conducted in vertical milling machine under dry, flood, water-soluble mineral oil, units cooltube 200 (vegetable oil) and xGnP nanoparticle in vegetable oil with MQL. 0.1 wt% and 1 μm diameter are regarded as optimum concentration and size of nanoparticle for enhanced cutting performance as compared to 1 wt% and 15 μm. The layered structure of nanographene reduces coefficient of friction significantly.\nSarhan et  al. (2012) investigated the effect of SiO2 nano-enriched milling of AA6061-T6 alloy using MQL. It was observed that SiO2 mixed with mineral oil improved milling performance in terms of specific power, cutting forces and coefficient of friction as compared to base fluid alone which attributes to sliding and rolling action of nano SiO2. Using same setup (Sayuti et al. 2013a) studied the effect of concentration, nozzle angle and cutting temperature. Using ANOVA analysis minimum cutting force was observed with 0.2 wt% SiO2 and 60° nozzle angle, and minimum cutting temperature was observed with 15° nozzle angle at 2 bar air pressure. Surface roughness can be minimized with high concentration of nanoparticles and with 30° nozzle angle.\nSayuti et al. (2013b) studied the influence of carbon anion-enriched nanofluid on machining aerospace aluminium alloy (duralumin Al-2017-T4) using vertical milling machine. 0%, 0.5%, 1% and 1.5 wt% concentrations of carbon anion were used during machining, and it was observed that 21.99% and 46.32% reduction in cutting forces and surface roughness can be obtained by nano-enriched cutting fluid as compared to conventional oil lubrication. Higher concentration of nanoparticles reduced cutting forces and improved surface quality. Sayuti et al. (2014a) concluded that addition of SiO2 improves the surface morphology during milling and reduces the thermal deformation of workpiece which attributes to the rolling action and formation of thin tribofilm that improves surface quality and conductivity.\nRahmati et al. (2014) analysed the milling performance on aluminium alloy and recorded improvement in surface finish by 3.87% with 0.5 wt% MoS2-enriched cutting fluid as compared to conventional oil. With further increase in concentration of nanoparticles, surface finish deteriorates. FESEM and XRD were used to study surface morphology.\nNajiha et  al. (2015) analysed the performance of water-mixed nanoparticles (TiO2) and compared the results with that of conventional oil-mixed nanoparticles. It was observed that both techniques produce almost same results for tool wear,\n18 Bio-Based Nano-Lubricants for Sustainable Manufacturing\n364\nTa bl\ne 18\n.4\nL ite\nra tu\nre r\nev ie\nw o\nf M\nQ L\n-a ss\nis te\nd tu\nrn in\ng w\nith n\nan op\nar tic\nle s\nA ut\nho r\nB as\ne flu\nid N\nan op\nar tic\nle s\nW or\nkp ie\nce\nm at\ner ia\nl\nPa ra\nm et\ner s\nM od\ne of\nlu\nbr ic\nat io\nn Pr\noc es\ns fin\ndi ng s C ut tin g sp ee d D ep th o f cu t Fe ed r at e\nK ri\nsh na\ne t a l.

Using same setup (Najiha and Rahman 2016) compared the wear phenomenon for TiO2-enriched water and conventional oil using MQL technique. Adhesion and abrasion wear were found to be major tool wear phenomenon in all three cases of lubrication (flood, MQL with vegetable oil, and MQL with water) which were comparable in all three modes of lubrication. Furthermore it was observed that due to cooling effect and high latent heat produced by water-based MQL, edge fracture and edge chipping were not seen. Varying concentrations of nanoparticles (0.5, 2.5, 4.5 wt%) of TiO2 in same setup (Najiha et al. 2016) recorded minimum tool wear at 2.5 vol% compared to other lubricating conditions. Experimental results were then compared with those of three-level fuzzy logic system.\nKim et  al. (2016) compared four different lubrication techniques (dry, flood, MQL with hBN in vegetable oil with and without chilly CO2 gas in end milling of Ti-6Al-4V alloy). 0.1 wt% of hBN provided enhanced milling performance than other lubrication techniques. Cooling and lubrication effect of both chilly CO2 gas and hBN effectively reduce surface roughness, chip adhesion of machined surface and tool wear.\nMuthusamy et al. (2016) analysed the wear analysis on milling of AISI 304 with TiO2 mixed ethylene glycol nanofluid with different concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 vol%). Milling AISI 304 steel with tin-coated carbide tool using TiO2 mixed nanofluid increase tool life (54.9 min) as compared to water-soluble coolant (32.67 min). Enhanced tool life was obtained with 1 vol% of TiO2 at all cutting speeds. It was observed from results shown by EDX and ESM that a layer formation by embedment of nanoparticles from nanofluid acts as a protective layer for cutting tool.\nLv et al. (2018) studied the effect of hybrid nanoparticles graphene dioxide and silicon dioxide (GO and SiO2) in water-based MQL lubrication technique at varying concentrations of both. On end milling of AISI 304, it was observed that addition of 0.02:0.05% of GO:SiO2 in water resulted in reduced tool wear, with improved surface finish and tool life. SiO2 and GO nanoparticles penetrate into the pits of the friction region thereby forming a smooth surface which enhances the rolling effect of SiO2 and slipping of GO sheets thereby forming a thin protective layer which distributes stress concentration and separates the sliding pairs minimizing wear (Table 18.5)."

      "text" : "Progression in genetic engineering has led to propagation of gigantic diversity of bioactives which demands effective means of carriers for intracellular delivery in order to achieve specific objectives such as selective tumor targeting, genetic vaccination, regenerative medicine, and treatment of functional loss. Generally, these biologics are prone to enzymatic degradation and deactivation. Hence, immense arrangement of efforts has been made to develop nanometric size vehicles which could not only deliver the medicaments to the desired site of action but also protect for unwanted degradation. In this regard, nanoparticles have been shown great promise as a delivery vehicle for smaller molecules, plus large bioactives, i.e., proteins, peptides, vaccines, or nucleotides by either restricted or tissue-specific delivery. In addition, formulation scientists are fascinated about nanocarriers as a delivery vehicles as proportion of quantity of surface atoms or molecules to the total count of atoms or molecules enhanced drastically hence effective surface area multiplied exponentially (Hadjipanayis et al. 2010). Further, nanoparticles are in great number and could access regions of poor access such as injured tissues, tumor cells, inflamed organs, etc. due to their tiny size (Jong and Borm 2008). Nanotechnology concentrates on encapsulating drugs in bio-friendly nanocomposites, i.e., polymeric nanoparticles, nanoliposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, micellar systems, and bioconjugates. A schematic diagram of different varieties of nanocarriers used for delivery of bioactives is depicted in Fig. 19.1. These carriers are usually explored to enhance oral bioavailability, to sustain medicament release\nA. K. Jain (*) School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, GGV Central University, Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, India\nU. Gupta Department of Pharmacy, Central University of Rajasthan, Kishangarh, Rajasthan, India\n382\nin desired organ, to dissolve the therapeutics for intravascular administration, to enhance the drug stability against enzyme-mediated degradation, and to achieve targeted (cellular/organ) delivery of drugs. In addition, the release of encapsulated cargo from nanocarriers can be controlled in the organ of interest in order to produce desired therapeutic level for desired period of time to generate maximum therapeutic benefits. Usually, nanoparticles have shown greater cellular uptake compared to microparticles (Desai et al. 1996). Several important human disorderrelated diseases have demonstrated significant improvement after treatment of protein-/peptide-loaded nanocarriers (Yu et al. 2016). Macromolecules have large size, high hydrophilicity and susceptibility to physical and chemical degradation, structural fragility, and complexity; hence, these characteristics strongly affect pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior in  vivo. Moreover, development processes such as higher temperature, exposure to organic solvents, etc. additionally compromise the stability of these macromolecules. To overcome all these challenges, extraordinary efforts are made to incorporate therapeutics in hydrogels, micellar systems, nanocapsules, nanoemulsions, nanoliposomes, and niosomes. Afterward, surface modification of these carriers by specific ligands was explored with an aim to deliver protein therapeutics into the organs of interest in active form. Nanomedicines approved by FDA are enlisted as per variety of carrier/material used in development of the formulation (Table  19.1). The key objective of\nA. K. Jain and U.

      "text" : "Liposomes are made of phospholipid bilayer enclosing aqueous cavity which could encapsulate small molecular weight drugs, peptides, proteins, and nucleotides (Yousefi et al. 2009; Patel et al. 2011). Usually, they have a particle size from 25 nm to several micrometers as per the number of bilayers present in the liposomes. Liposomes are proved to be versatile carriers because they offer flexibility in terms of vesicle size, surface charge, bilayer composition, and encapsulation ability which also make these carriers useful for delivery of bioactives. Lipid combination made of distearoyl phosphatidylcholine, dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, and cholesterol (Anderson et al. 1999); a blend of phosphatidylcholine, castor oil, and polyethylene glycol attached to distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (Song et al. 1996); and a blend of distearoyl phosphatidylglycerol, distearoyl phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol (Rezler et al. 2007) are usually used for the preparation of liposomes. Usually aqueous compartment contains hydrophilic agents, whereas lipophilic drugs are inserted into the lipid bilayer (Patel et  al. 2009). Bioactives which are prone to degradation are prepared using reverse-phase evaporation process which bypasses unwanted exposure of/to harmful solvents. Liposomes having nano size range can also prolong the release of entrapped bioactives, warranting sustained effect at the site of interest. Pulmonary delivery of insulin is achieved via liposomes which has shown number of advantages as an alternative to insulin injection such as sustained blood glucose levels with a higher pharmacological bioavailability compared to dry powder inhalation (Bi et al. 2008). Further, Bak proteins and voltagedependent anionic channel (VDAC) were loaded into the liposomes and produce apoptosis into mammalian cells through cytochrome C and caspase activation (Liguori et al. 2008).\nRemoval of liposomes from blood circulation takes place in a size-dependent manner through membrane fusion actions and interactions with specific serum proteins (opsonins). Despite the fact that cell surface receptors cannot detect liposome directly as a foreign particle, they identify liposomes via cellular and serum proteins that are adhered to liposomal surface (Ishida et al. 2002). Circulation time of liposomes can be enhanced, and also macrophage uptake can be reduced by means of PEGylation which provides anti-opsonizing properties to the liposomes, once it is decorated on the exterior surface by forming a hydrophilic layer of polymer, hence sheltering the charge associated with liposome surface. Usually, RES cells identify and react with liposomes through opsonins, but hydrophilicity of PEG layer helps in escaping the liposomes. Kedar et  al. (1994) have significantly enhanced survival\nA. K. Jain and U. Gupta\n389\ntime of mice with metastatic carcinoma (earlier subjected to cyclophosphamide chemotherapy) was enhanced by two to six times followed by treatment with SSL-IL-2 compared to IL-2 even after lower doses and fewer administrations compared to plain interleukin-2 (IL-2). Enhanced cellular translocation of TAT peptide (transactivator of transcription of human immunodeficiency virus) was reported by incorporating it into the liposomes (Carsten et al. 2004). Dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) and guanidinium-cholesterol cationic lipid liposomes successfully entrapped the β-galactosidase enzyme and the anti-cytokeratin8 (K8) antibody and enhanced cellular delivery of β-galactosidase devoid of any negotiation in its activity (Chatin et al. 2015). In recent time, the applicability of bilosomes as a viable approach for oral administration of larger peptides and proteins along with associated biopharmaceutical challenges has been reviewed by Ahmad et al. (2017).\nNiosomes are spontaneously gathered non-ionic surfactants vesicles generally made of alkyl or dialkyl polyglycerol ether class surfactants are (Malhotra and Jain 1994). Lamellar structures fashioned by mingling cholesterol and non-ionic surfactant and followed by hydration which leads to closed bilayer vesicle upon providing some energy such as physical agitation. Such bilayer structures are spontaneous arrangement of surfactant in such a way that allows hydrophilic heads to remain exposed to the aqueous phase while lipophilic tails acquaint themselves with the lipid phase. Niosomes are extensively investigated as a cheaper substitute of liposomes however is of synthetic origin. These vesicles as a carrier systems are closely having similar physical characteristics, in vitro release behavior, as well as in vivo behavior to the liposomes. These carriers not only have maximum advantages of liposomes, but also the economy, enhanced stability, and flexibility in storage conditions make them as ideal alternatives to phospholipids vesicles. Cholesterol is used to facilitate vesicle preparation, which are less leaky. Additionally, stabilizers could also be added to avoid aggregation of niosomes by repulsive, steric, or electrostatic effect. Theoretically niosome formation necessitates the existence of a specific type of amphiphile which possesses an aqueous head and a liphophilic tail and aqueous solvent. The lipophilic unit may consist of one or two alkyl or perfluoroalkyl moieties or, in certain cases, a single steroidal group usually from C12 to C18. Unit chain alkyl as lipophilic tail is more toxic compared to respective dialkylether chain although the ester-based surfactants are chemically somewhat unstable compared to ether-type surfactants. C16EO5 (polyoxyethylene cetyl ether) or C18EO5 (polyoxyethylene stearyl ether) surfactants are mainly utilized for synthesis of polyhedral vesicles. Various aspects manipulating the formation of niosomes are as follows: nature of surfactants, membrane composition, nature of encapsulated drug, and hydration temperature which is responsible for shape and size of the niosomes. The perfect condition for hydration is favored to be above the gel-to-liquid phase transition temperature of the system. The following are applications of niosomes: delivery of anti-cancer drugs, i.e., doxorubicin, paclitaxel, methotrexate; delivery of peptide drugs, i.e., insulin, oligonucleotide; ophthalmic drug delivery; and also transdermal drug delivery. Niosomes demonstrated greater stability to both temperature and oxidation in contrast to the major components of liposomes, i.e., phospholipids, hence are easy to handle without any serious precautions to be taken\n19 Nanomaterials Used for Delivery of Bioactives\n390\nin storage (Fang et al. 2001). The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is therapeutically utilized for the management of Alzheimer’s disease however unable to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) similar to other endogenous peptides; hence, its parenteral delivery is restricted. The entrapment of VIP in glucose decorated niosomes significantly enhances brain transport of peptide compared to control niosomes (up to 86%, in 5 min) (Biswal et al. 2008). Niosomes containing ethanol showed elastic behavior, hence increasing the intracellular translocation and greater stability of the Tat-GFP fusion protein against chemical degradation (Manosroi et  al. 2011). Niosomes were used as a transporter of insulin and demonstrated noteworthy plasma glucose-lowering effect which continued for prolonged period of time (Khaksa et al. 2000). Further niosomes are also used as adjuvant for oral vaccination which demonstrated significant enhancement of antibody levels after encapsulation of ovalbumin into niosomes and shown better immune response compared to Freund’s complete adjuvant (FCA), in the BALB/c mice (Rentel et al. 1999)."

As per the method used for their preparation, nanoparticles, nanospheres, or nanocapsules could be produced. Contrasting to nanospheres in which drugs are dispersed in polymer matrix, nanocapsules are vesicular systems in which the drug exits as a core in an aqueous or oily cavity which is covered by coating of polymer; hence, they are “reservoir” system. Nanoparticles not necessarily exhibit size-dependent characteristics which alter greatly in fine particles or bulk materials. The drug/bioactive may be solubilized, dispersed, encapsulated, or adhered to a nanoparticle matrix. A supplementary trustworthy technique to increase the stability of bioactives is encapsulation into a nanoparticle, which protects it from the non-friendly atmosphere inside the biological system and improves the delivery at the site of action (Niven et al. 1994). Encapsulated bioactives were released from the nanoparticles by different mechanisms, i.e., diffusion, erosion, swelling, or polymer degradation. Nanoparticles provide an appropriate way of transporting low molecular weight therapeutics, plus larger bioactives, i.e., proteins, peptides, or genes through localized or targeted delivery to the desired organ. Nanotechnology concentrates on encapsulating therapeutics in biocompatible nanocomposites, i.e., nanoparticles, nanocapsules, micellar systems, and nanoconjugates. These carriers could be utilized to offer targeted drug delivery (cellular/ tissue) in order to enhance oral bioavailability, to prolong drug/gene response at the desired site, to dissolve drugs for IV administration, and to stabilize therapeutic agents against enzymatic degradation. Additionally, the release of an entrapped material from nanoparticles to attain wanted therapeutic response in target site for\nA. K. Jain and U. Gupta\n391\nnecessary extent should be managed. Nanoparticles have comparatively higher intracellular uptake than microparticles. Polymeric nanoparticles hold remarkable assurance for the efficient cure of disorders as they have marvelous physicochemical characteristics, i.e., size, surface charge, hydrophilicity, and lipophilicity, hence considered as prospective carriers for bioactives, i.e., vaccines, peptides, anticancer drugs, genes, etc. Eventually, nanoparticles offer numerous advantages compared to free drug, such as protection from unwanted reactions with biological moieties and breakdown, improving the absorption into a desired organ (tumors), and escalating the pharmacokinetics of the therapeutics. Additionally, rate of medicament release from nanoparticles can be amended effortlessly to match up desired therapeutic levels into target organ for desired period of time. Once designed properly, nanoparticles can serve as a model delivery vehicle by preferentially picked up by cancer cells or tumor mass and also avoids early degradation of medicament during its transport. Further, intracellular delivery of the associated agents could be accomplished by engulfment through endocytosis/phagocytosis of nanoparticles. Moreover, characteristics of a polymer could be easily altered; nanoparticles comprise of a versatile carrier system that can be modified to synthesize the nanoparticles which are capable to cross through the biological obstacles and transport the load into the cells and/or intracellular space. As per the rate and extent of prolonged and controlled release of the incorporated protein, various natural and/or artificial polymers have been explored for the formulation of nanoparticles, i.e., chitosan, dextran, starch, albumin, gelatin, 2-methoxyethyl vinyl ether, copolymer of maleic anhydride and cyanoacrylates, poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), PEG-PLA block copolymers, and poly(n-hexadecyl cyanoacrylate) (Soppimath et al. 2001; Solaro and Chiellini 2006; Rytting et al. 2008; Solaro 2008; Duan et al. 2009). A list of polymers which are frequently used for development of nanoparticles as protein carriers is shown in Table 19.2. Out of different techniques reported for the development of polymeric nanoparticles, majority of them reports\n19 Nanomaterials Used for Delivery of Bioactives\n392\ntwo key steps: the first step is emulsion formation, and the second is solvent evaporation or gelation/precipitation of polymer or polymerization. A schematic demonstration of commonly used techniques for development of polymeric nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 19.2. Great attention has been given to biodegradable polymers which are self- eliminating, hence overcoming the concern of surgical removal of carrier system. Permeation of insulin and tetanus toxoid were increased through oral and nasal mucosa by encapsulating it into PEG and chitosan-coated PLA/ PLGA nanoparticles, respectively (Vila et  al. 2002). Nanoparticles composed of biodegradable polymers poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and blend of PLA and PLGA not only protected insulin from proteolytic degradation into the GI tract but also fruitfully decrease plasma sugar concentration after oral administration to diabetic rats (Damge et al. 2007). Higher toxoid levels were observed in the blood stream and lymph nodes with PEGylated nanoparticles containing tetanus toxoid after\nA. K. Jain and U. Gupta\n393\nnasal and oral administration to rats (Vila et  al. 2005). Previously, our research group has established the usefulness of starch nanoparticles for nasal delivery of insulin (Jain et al. 2008) which showed superior hypoglcemic response compared to nasal insulin solution (Fig. 19.3). One of the approaches which is widely used for protein delivery by conjugation with various nanocarriers is receptor-mediated endocytosis (vide infra). In this regard, our research group previously tested the in vivo efficacy of vitamin B12 (VB12) coupled dextran nanoparticles after oral administration of VB12 coupled dextran NPs containing insulin (Fig.  19.4). We have also demonstrated the prevalence of VB12-mediated RME uptake of NPs by co-administering the large excess of VB12 to saturate the receptors 1 h prior to dosing of VB12-conjugated nanocarriers (Chalasani et  al. 2007). Carboxymethyl-βcyclodextrin-decorated chitosan (CMCD-g-CS) nanoparticles showed higher in vitro release profile of BSA in simulated intestinal fluid compared to gastric fluid (Song et al. 2017). Conjugation of cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) to the surface of the 15 nm chitosan nanoparticles (prepared by nanoemulsion method) was carried out and tested in Caco-2 cell line for translocation of insulin across the cell monolayer and found to be effective with 15–19% increase in insulin levels (Barbari et  al. 2017). An exhaustive inventory of nanomedicines which are granted FDA approval and are classified as per type of carrier/material utilized in production of the nano formulation is shown in Table 19.1.\n19 Nanomaterials Used for Delivery of Bioactives\n394"

      "heading" : "19.3.2 Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs)",
      "text" : "SLNs are composed of solid lipids which are stabilized by means of surfactants in an aqueous suspension. They hold close resemblance to nanoemulsion; the only difference is that liquid lipid is substituted with a solid lipid. This replacement of oils with solid lipids controls drug release in an outstanding style, since solid lipid lowers mobility of drug significantly, as compared to oil phase (Martins et al. 2007). SLNs have gained attention in the last few years as carrier system for macromolecules (Marcato and Duran 2008). SLNs are coupled with few advantages and at the same time circumvent some drawbacks of many different carriers such as nanoparticles, liposome, ethosomes, and lipid emulsion.\nThe advantages offered by SLNs include:\n(i) They have drug targeting and controlled drug release ability. (ii) Protection of labile drugs against photochemical, chemical, and oxidative\ndegradation. (iii) Limited toxicity compared to polymeric nanoparticles, as SLNs are made of physiological and biocompatible lipids. (iv) Equally suitable for both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. (v) Bypass exposure of macromolecules to non-friendly hydrophobic solvents. (vi) SLNs are useful for delivery of macromolecules through various routes such as\noral, pulmonary, intravenous, ophthalmic, and dermal (Garcia-Fuentes et al. 2003; Hou et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2008; Joshi and Muller 2009).\nA. K. Jain and U. Gupta\n395\nDelivery of macromolecules particularly proteins, peptides, and genes might face problems pertaining to their entrapment, as most of them have hydrophobic moieties that show adsorbing behavior onto surfaces (e.g., plastic and glass). This tendency could explain the ways to discrete losses in the amount of bioactives which reaches to the site of action (Duncan et al. 1995).\nMainly researchers described three models for incorporation of drugs or bioactives into the SLNs (Muller et al. 2000; Mehnert and Mader 2001), namely, (i) the drug-enriched shell model, (ii) the homogeneous matrix model, and (iii) the drugenriched core model. These three models have different formulation composition such as chemical composition of the lipid, bioactive, and surfactants, along with the production method. Contrasting to most of the microsphere and nanoparticle which are made of polymers, SLN preparation techniques avoid potentially toxic organic solvents which may deteriorate bioactives. In addition, under prominent conditions, SLNs can be produced to entrap a huge variety of drugs and emerge to accomplish the desires of optimum nanocarriers (Muller et al. 1995; Wissing et al. 2004). The synthesis of SLN depends on solidification of dispersed phase. As a result, due to hydrophilic nature of bioactives, they have shown poor entrapment into the lipophilic material of SLN that tends to distribute into the aqueous phase during the course, which is promoted by the utilization of emulsifier (surfactants) and stabilizers. Solid lipid nanoparticles are usually prepared by solid lipid nanoparticles by hot homogenization technique (Fig.  19.5). Also, SLN can demonstrate partial\n19 Nanomaterials Used for Delivery of Bioactives\n396\nentrapment owing to drug leakage during storage. In the last few decades, researchers have continuously publicized encouraging results regarding encapsulation of bioactives in SLNs. Numerous peptides such as somatostatin, lysozyme, LHRH, insulin, malaria antigens, calcitonin, and HBsAg have been encapsulated into the SLNs and studied for their stability, in vitro drug release kinetics, and in vivo performance (Table 19.3).\nVarious strategies have been explored to load macromolecules in liganddecorated SLNs to enhance oral bioavailability and showed protein activity via both caveolae- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Fan et al. 2014). However, mucus was an obstacle to the translocation of SLNs. The absolute bioavailability of peptides was improved by 2.45 to 1.98 times compared to unmodified SLNs, suggesting their effectiveness in oral bioavailability enhancement of proteins. In another report, the gonadorelin (a model peptide) was incorporated into the SLN developed by solvent diffusion technique and evaluated for various parameters. (Hu et al. 2004). Lysozyme (a model peptide) was solubilized into the melted lipid phase, and it remained intact during the course of the process without diminishing its activity and found solubilitydependent entrapment efficiency of the peptide in the hydrophobic phase (Almeida et  al. 1997). In another study, physiochemical stability, intracellular uptake by Caco-2 cells, and in vitro cytotoxicity of beta-carotene (BC) SLNs were evaluated and found minimum cytotoxicity of SLNs particularly after dilution (≥10 times) (Yi et al. 2014). Goppert and Muller (2005) studied adsorption pattern of human plasma protein on the outermost layer of SLNs after IV injection and found SLN as a potential targeted drug delivery formulation."

Pore size and pore structure could be altered by ease by selection of surfactant and co-assembly conditions. Higher porous surface along with huge effective surface area of Mesoporus silica nanoparticles (MSN), hence MSN are being exploited as potential nanocarriers for bioactive molecules. Dimension, shape, and surface functionalization of MSN control the release rate of encapsulated bioactives. FITCcytochrome C was effectively delivered into the HeLa cells after encapsulation into the MSN through a diffusion-mediated process. Also, it was demonstrated by confocal images that FITC-cytochrome C effectively runs away from the endosomal degradation pathways (Tan et al. 2004; Lu et al. 2007). These cellular uptake and endosomal breakout processes of MSNs are energy dependent, whereas surface modification of MSNs by amine and guanidinium makes them able to infiltrate into the cells by a clathrin- and covalent-free pathway (Xing et al. 2005; Slowing et al. 2006). Prasetyanto et al. (2016) published a straightforward approach to encapsulate a highly cytotoxic protein by encapsulating into the organosilica matrices which disintegrate while contact to a chemical response and demonstrated successful cellular delivery into the C6 glioma cells. Alternatively, ligands and antibodies govern the cellular translocation of MSNs by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, MSNs have been coated with release retarding agents such as chitosanPEG copolymers, to modulate the release rate of entrapped material (Tan et  al. 2004; Lu et al. 2007). Encapsulation efficiency of OVA (ovalbumin) was multiplied by 2.5-fold after surface modification of NPs with positively charged amine because of electrostatic interaction. Amino group modified the zeta potential of the particle from negativity toward positivity (Mahony et  al. 2013). Amino-modified silica nanospheres along with photoluminescent CaF2:Tm,Yb nanocrystals have shown higher protein loading and prolonged release of the encapsulated cargo and showed usefulness in cell uptake of bioactives (Li et al. 2017). Besides its use as a delivery vehicle, MSNs were investigated as an immune booster which elicit immune response even at smaller OVA levels. These NPs are synthesized under controlled conditions allowing the modification of pore shape and surface groups (Vallet-Regi et  al. 2007), which could be later on conjugated with various mAb structures. Larger pores offer chances for higher loading of mAbs. Surface-functionalized MSN has been encapsulated with a mAb against tumor cell surface protein and administered to mice with melanoma (Lei et al. 2010). The administration of particle-encapsulated mAb demonstrated enhanced suppression of tumor enlargement when compared to pure mAb injection. Findings suggest that encapsulation of mAb into MSN did not change the therapeutics effect or immunological potential, however and by assisting prolonged release of antibody results in enhancement of the half-life of the mAb at the tumor tissue. Mice with malignant mesotheliomas treated with intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (DOX) encapsulated into the MSNs which were attached to mesothelin- specific antibody (Macura et al. 2013). The surface-decorated MSN were shown higher effectiveness compared to plain DOX at lower dose level hence able to significantly diminish the undesired effects\nA. K. Jain and U. Gupta\n399\nof DOX. MSN were also attached to antibody directed against epidermal growth factor in order to treat lung cancer cells, with cytotoxic drug pyrrolidone-2, and demonstrated a 38% reduction in tumor growth with low systemic toxicity (Sundarraj et al. 2014). Also, silica nanospheres composed of vacant core pooled with pH-sensitive chitosan transported encapsulated protein into breast cancer cells through targeting antibody ErbB2 and found higher levels in tumors because of lower local pH at tumors (pH  4.0 Vs physiological pH) upon administration to mouse model (Deng et al. 2011)"

Also, gold NPs were covalently conjugated with protein antigens without any chemical interactions and acted as adjuvant in order to produce a vaccine for cancer immunotherapy. Five nm gold nanoparticles were utilized for protein delivery by treating Balb/c mouse with OVA and AUNPs and were found to be highly effective in producing anti-OVA IgG antibodies (Tang et al. 2013).

In vivo delivery of macromolecules is emerging importance day by day particularly after latest advancement in recombinant technology which leads to commercial supply of huge variety of therapeutically effective macromolecules. The survival of these agents in the biological environment is of vital importance due to possible denaturation or enzymatic degradation in the absence of an ideal carrier. The selected carrier must provide the complete protection and should be able to translocate the cargo as per desired needs. Hence, it is critically important to design a suitable carrier of appropriate size, composition, and surface behavior as well as biocompatible. Out of the huge range of the carriers studied, nanocarriers emerged as an outstanding choice during the last decades for their successful therapeutic effects through oral, pulmonary, buccal, nasal, as well as parenteral routes.\nBecause of the biocompatible nature of lipids utilized in synthesis of nanoliposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles, these carriers are proved to be more safe than other types of nanocarriers. Moreover, lipid-based carriers serve as strong immunological adjuvants, capable of eliciting cellular and humoral response against a range of infectious agents related to human disease. However, generally they show considerable instability because of inadequate shelf-life and shorter half time. Indeed, because of high stability of polymeric nanoparticles over other nanocarriers, they emerged as promising carriers of bioactives to meet specific requirements. In addition, surface decoration of these nanoparticles with specific ligands RES uptake can be drastically decreased which is a key constraint with these carriers. On the other hand, synthesis of polymeric nanocarriers generally involves use of organic solvents which could have deleterious effect on macromolecules. Therefore, these drawbacks could be beaten by the picking up protein friendly method for particle synthesis by employment of self-assembling water-soluble polymers.\nA. K. Jain and U. Gupta\n401"

Broccoli phytochemicals are loaded with polyphenols, glucosinolates (GLs), vitamin C, carotene, folic acid, and fibers (Conaway et al. 2001; Mahn and Reyes 2011). These constituents enhance antioxidant activities and stimulate phase-2 detoxification enzymes (Tang et  al. 2006; Qazi et al. 2010). Broccoli-loaded gold nanoparticles (B-Au NPs) were synthesized and were analyzed against some cancerous cells, such as MDA-MB-231, SkBr3, and T47D cells of breast carcinoma, PC-3 cells of prostate carcinoma, and U266 cells of myeloma to evaluate the anti-cancerous activity (Khoobchandani et al. 2013). The findings revealed that the conjugated B-Au NPs possessed excellent anti-cancerous effects against breast carcinoma, prostate carcinoma and myeloma cells."

A previous study reported the synthesis of gold-quercetin nanoparticles (GQ NPs) and its anticancer activity against liver carcinoma (Ren et al. 2017). The GQ NPs regulated abnormal proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration in liver cancer cells, and subsequently inhibited cancer progression. GQ NPs encouraged apoptosis in liver carcinoma cells by activation of caspases (3, 9) and expression of cytochrome c (Cyto-c). The study showed that GQ  NPs impair the caspase/Cyto-c pathway, obstruct NF-κB/COX-2 and Akt/ERK1/2, and suppress AP-2β/hTERT signaling pathways."

Curcumin is a natural bioactive polyphenolic constituent, found in turmeric, with properties to inhibit proliferation and metastasis in a wide range of cancers (Joe et al. 2004). However, poor solubility in water has limited the systemic bioavailability of curcumin when administered orally. To overcome the solubility and bioavailability restrictions of curcumin, it was loaded on various types of nanoparticles. Methoxy polyethylene glycol (mPEG) and polycaprolactone (PCL) co-polymers enhanced the anticancerous activity of curcumin with efficient loading capability and sustainable release in A549 cells of lung epithelial carcinoma. This curcumin-loaded nanoparticle effectively enters into lung carcinoma A549 cells and interacts with the nucleus to encourage apoptosis (Yin et  al. 2013). Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid curcumin\nA.

PLGA-CUR NPs conjugated with epidermoid growth factor receptor were targeted to GE11 peptides in breast carcinoma cells in vitro and in a tumorous mice model. It extended the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in MCF-7 cells of breast carcinoma and reduced the phosphoinositide-3 kinase pathway, suppressed tumor growth, suppressed cancer cell proliferation, and improved drug clearance from the circulation (Jin et al. 2017). Curcumin-loaded magnetic nanoparticles were also significantly taken up in MDA-MB-231 cells of human epithelial breast carcinoma. These nanoparticles showed strong anticancer activity via strong penetration power into the cell by endocytosis (Yallapu et al. 2012). The uploaded curcumin magnetic nanoparticles exhibited strong magnetic resonance properties and potentially enhanced the anticancer targeting capacity of curcumin.\nNano-curcumin effectively decreased the level of miRNA-21, β-catenin, and the expression of E6/E7 HPV oncoproteins in a mouse cervical cancer model (Zaman et  al. 2016). Also, curcumin-loaded silica nanoparticles (Dinda et  al. 2012) and curcumin-loaded folate-modified chitosan nanoparticles (Esfandiarpour-Boroujeni et al. 2017) have significant anticancer effect against HepG2 cells of hepatocellular carcinoma and MCF-7 cells of breast carcinoma, respectively.\n20.2.1.4 Selaginella doederleinii Leaf Nanoparticles\nSelaginella doederleinii Hieron possesses several bioactive phytochemicals and has been extensively used in traditional herbal medicine for curing rheumatoid arthritis and various cancers, specifically lung cancer, cervical cancer, choriocarcinoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Abdille et al. 2005; Ishii et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2015). Selaginella leaf extract nanoparticles (SDNPs) reduced the viability of lung carcinoma A549 cells and were least toxic to normal Chang liver cells (Syaefudin et al. 2016). The findings revealed the apoptotic potential of SDNPs and the targeted drug delivery system without affecting the normal Chang cells.\nA.

Thymoquinone is one of the major active phyto-constituents present in Nigella sativa and possesses various pharmacological properties: antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, antipyretic, hypoglycemic, analgesic, and antioxidant (Ali and Blunden 2003). Previous studies reported the anticancer and antimutagenic activity of thymoquinone in Caco-2, HT-29, HCT-116, DLD-1, and LoVo cancerous cells (GaliMuhtasib et  al. 2006). The encapsulated thymoquinone (TQ) nanoparticles (TQ NPs) were synthesized with the help of biodegradable polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) (less than 50 nm in size) and significantly enhanced anticancer efficacy by increasing bioavailability and solubility (Bhattacharya et al. 2015) of TQ. In vitro study in MCF-7 cells of breast carcinoma and in vivo tumorbearing mice demonstrated that PEG-TQ NPs enhance miR-34a, repress Rac1 mRNA protein expression, prevent cell migration, and hinder angiogenesis. TQ loaded with modified molecular micelles, PLGA nanoparticles, and chitosan myristic acid nanogel exhibited more antioxidant and antiproliferative effectiveness at low doses with controlled release as compared with pure TQ against MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 of breast carcinoma (Ganea et al. 2010; Dehghani et al. 2015). These findings showed that TQ NP have a more potent apoptotic effect than pure TQ."

The anticancer activity of HK-MPEG/PCL showed reduced tumor growth and apoptotic induction in a cancer nude mouse model and prevented angiogenesis (Cheng et al. 2016). Another study on honokiol-loaded co-polymer synthesized with folate and polyethyleneimine nanoparticles (HK NPs) significantly prevented metastasis, proliferation, tumor growth, angiogenesis, and cell-cycle progression (Gou et al. 2010).

Silibinin encourages apoptosis via inhibiting cell-cycle progression, preventing proliferation, impairs angiogenesis, and enhancing immune stimulation in several cancers (Mateen et al. 2010; Nejati-Koshki et al. 2012; Surai 2015). Some previous studies demonstrated that silibinin arrested the cancer cycle and inhibited the growth, progression, and angiogenesis of tumorous cells (Singh et  al. 2006; Liang et  al. 2014). Silibinin-loaded nanoparticles with PLGA-PEG co-polymer were synthesized to evaluate the anticancer potential and expression of the hTERT gene in T47D cells of breast carcinoma and A549 cells of lung carcinoma. The findings showed that hTERT expression more efficiently reduced the cell viability of both cancerous cells with the increasing concentrations of nano-silibinin as compared to the pure silibinin (Ebrahimnezhad et  al.  2013; Amirsaadat et al. 2017). The silibinin-loaded phosphatidylcholine lipid nanoparticles significantly reduced the growth and angiogenesis of breast carcinoma (Xu et al. 2013).

Besides their lipophilic nature, the bioactivity of essential oil also depends on different functional groups (nature and position), volatility, and molecular weight of compounds. Acetate-derived methyl groups and double-bonded benzene ring of eugenol, safrole, and limonene actively take part in knockdown of different enzymes and fumigant toxicity of Spodoptera litura, Callosobruchus chinensis, Tribolium castaneum, and other storage insects. Lower  solubility, higher  volatility and oxidation tendency, are the major problem in practical application of essential oil for post harvest pest management. These problems may be effectively resolved to a greater extent by nanoencapsulated essential oil-based pesticides (nanopesticides) or nanoformulated essential oil. Christofoli et  al. (2015) reported on Zanthoxylum rhombifolium essential oil loaded nanospheres against Bemisia tabaci.",

Droplets may get associated with each other without interfering their original size, and this process is known as flocculation. In addition, a number of nano-droplets may come across each other and form a large droplet by the process known as coalescence. However, for effective commercial applications, it is necessary to avoid nanodroplet aggregation as much as possible. For this, attractive forces, viz., hydrophobic and van der Waals forces, may be compensated by the repulsive forces, viz., electrostatic and steric actions between the nano-droplets. In addition, the decreased nanoparticle size is correlated with reduction of nano-droplet aggregation (Degner et al. 2014). According to McClements (2004), along homogenization, differences in soluble phases and emulsifier concentration and types are the governing factors regulating the size of the droplets.",

Moreover, soluble ions released from metallic nanoparticles appear be the main cause of ecotoxicity (Aruoja et al. 2009). Green plants are also affected by metallic nanoparticles as these particles enter into the plant by various means such as stomata, cuts or wounds, and through the roots. Zn and ZnO nanoparticles negatively affect the growth of Raphanus sativus (radish), Brassica napus (rape), and Lolium perenne (ryegrass) (Lin and Xing 2007).

NPs have promising application in the field of nanofertilizer, nanopesticide, nanoherbicide, nanosensor and as a delivery system for the sustained release of agrochemicals (Mishra et al. 2017; Koul et al. 2018; Singh et al. 2018; Tripathi et al. 2018; Vishwakarma et al. 2018). It was of thought that NPs could be used for boosting the agricultural economic growth in the near future (Sabourin and Ayande 2015). But, unregulated use of NPs has threw the ecosystems at the brink of risk caused by toxicity of these NPs (Hong et al. 2014). Although NPs have gained the rapid attention of plant scientists during the recent few years, their fates in relation to sustainable agriculture are still unexplored. Despite of achievements in the field of NPs in agronomy, their role is still in a topsy-turvy stage (Yang et al. 2017). Different types of plants behave NPs differently. Also, same plant behaves different NPs differently. The response of NPs on plants as well as microbes depends upon the nature and concentration of NPs, nature of coating material, nature of growth media, mode of application, part of the plants, and even stage of plant development (Yang et al. 2017). As most of the NPs are made up of heavy metals, their elevated concentration in the biological systems could be detrimental to both aboveground and belowground flora as well. Yang et al. (2017) have concluded the interaction of NPs with plants and microbes in their review.",

TiO2 NPs were absorbed by the Triticum aestivum, Brassica napus, and Arabidopsis thaliana but did not affect their germination and root elongation (Larue et al. 2011). Despite enormous researches carried out on NP-plant interaction, no clear conclusion has been made till date. NPs are reported to play positive, negative, as well as neutral roles on plant growth.

The outcome of the study showed that free bacterial counts diminished significantly (P < 0.001). The rate of decrease of free L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus was significantly faster than single- and double-coated formation of encapsulated probiotics. Due to the lack of strength of single chitosan-coated beads under pH 1.55, the counts reduced 5-log and 4-log of L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, respectively.

Kim et al. (2017) successfully encapsulated probiotics bacteria L. acidophilus through ionic gelation method and examine the encapsulated probiotics in stimulated gastric condition and storage. At first L. acidophilus encapsulated in biocompatible and biodegradable capsules constructed by ionic gelation between chitosan (CS) and phytic acid (PA). To increase the stability of capsules, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and starch were utilized. After 2 hours in acidic condition (pH 1.5, stimulated gastric fluid), the cells of L. acidophilus decreased only 0.64 log CFU/g. Among them, PA-CS-CaCO3 capsules are more stable than other two capsules in pH 1.5 and 2.0. This study proved that encapsulation provides more viability and storage capacity of probiotics bacteria. Likewise, Ebrahimnejad et al. (2017) demonstrated that nanoencapsulation of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus in chitosan endorse good probiotic viability and stability in intestinal juice.",
