      "text" : "Microtubules (MTs) are long structures cytoskeleton spreading between cell membrane and nucleus. Mts play a vital role in cell division, maintenance of cells and for motor proteins. MTs are hollow cylinder of protofilaments (PFs) which are series of proteins also known as tubline dimers and good for manufacturing and designing electronic nano devices. In cylindrical form, these dimers may be in radially or in straight position like\n* Aly R.

Each dimer behaves like a dipole. They exist in intrinsic electric field as a giant dipole with negatively charged end. They show instability behaviour in non-neuronal cells i.e. polymerization or depolymerization and stable in neuronal cells. They respond in managing storage and transduction of information in brain (Alam and Belacem 2016).\nIn other words, MTs behave like traffic road for motor proteins and nonlinear in nature. Whereas weak covalent bonds lie in all nonlinear biological systems and strong in linear models. Nonlinear models explained through nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDEs) having solutions in the form of solitary waves (Seadawy and Alamri 2018; Arnous et al. 2017; Ahmad et al. 2020; Ehab 2016; Abdullah et al. 2017; Dianchen et al. 2018a, b; Ali et al. 2018a, b; Khater et al. 2006). Solitons are the solitary waves expressing propagation of waves with nonlinearity and dispersion in continuous media. Solitons are stable in reference to conserve their shape energy after collision. They are the solutions of weakly NLPDE describing physical system. Soliton appear as power decays within a continuous wave is said to be dark soliton and standard beam is bright soliton (Zayed and Alurrfi 2015; Iqbal et al. 2019; Seadawy et al. 2020, 2020; Ablowitz and Segur 1981).\nNLPDEs have been used in mathematics, fluid mechanics and so many different physical systems. There is no general technique to solve NLPDEs, however every equation is to be taken as an individual problem. There are many nonlinear physical phenomena such as optical fibers, chemical kinematics, plasma physics, chemical physics, geochemistry which shows nonlinear behaviour in engineering and science fields. In recent years, in order to find out exact or approximately solutions the study of NLPDEs is on its peak with the help of different methods (Seadawy 2018; Seadawy and El-Rashidy 2018; Seadawy 2017; Seadawy and El-Rashidy 2016; Seadawy 2017; Helal and Seadawy 2012; Khater et al. 2006; Seadawy 2011, 2016, 2015). Some of these methods are Jacobi elliptic function method (Dai and Zhang 2006), the generalized projective Riccati equation method (Zayed and Alurrfi 2015), F-expansion method (Ren and Zhang 2006), the generalized (G�∕G)-expansion method (Younis and Rizvi 2015), exp(−ϕ(x))function method (Yaşar and Seadawy 2020), trigonometric series function (Zhang 2008), first integral (Bekir and Unsal 2012; Ekici et al. 2016), modified extended tanh function method (Younis et  al. 2015), inverse scattering (Ablowitz and Segur 1981), extended trial equation scheme (Ekici et al. 2016), rational function method (Lee 2009) and last but not least Hirota bilinear method (Liu et  al. 2019; Yang et  al. 2019). The objective of this paper is to use Hirota bilinear method and the extended (G�∕G)-expansion method to discuss soliton interaction and other solitary wave solutions respectively for describing the model of MTs (Zayed and Alurrfi 2015; Alam and Belacem 2016). The model of MTs showing nonlinear dynamics as nano bioelectronics transmission is given by (Alam and Belacem 2016)\nwhere m is the mass of the dimer, u(x, t) is the traveling wave, l is the MT length, r is the viscosity coefficient, E is magnitude of intrinsic field and A, B are parameters. The physical detail of this equation was discussed by Zekovic et al. (2014) which is omitted here. The exact solution of Eq. (1) with the help of Jacobi elliptic method, have been already studied by Zekovic.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sect.  2, Hirota bilinear method is used to study soliton interaction (1-soliton transformation; two-, three-soltion interaction ) for\n(1)mutt(x, t) − kl2uxx(x, t) − qE − Au(x, t) + Bu3(x, t) + rut(x, t) = 0\nInteraction properties of soliton molecules and Painleve…\n1 3\nPage 3 of 15 329\nMTs model, in Sect. 3, some new solitary wave solutions are obtained by G ′\nG -expansion\nscheme, in Sect. 4, we discuss the integrability of MTs model through Painleve anlysis, in Sect. 5, we discuss results and discussion and at the end, we present conclusion."

Alam and Belgacem investigated the same model through the exp(− (x))-expansion method and obtained kink type solutions (Alam and Belacem 2016).

We also gave graphical representations of all these solutions by presenting 3D graphs, contour plots, density plots and 2D graphs. Moreover, these methods are direct, effective and can be used for any other NLEEs. These solutions play an important role in the study of nonlinear physical phenomena. Furthermore, we have checked the integrability of MTs by using Painleve analysis."

We also implemented the extended (G�∕G)-expansion method to obtain soliton solutions of various types. We obtained bell shaped, kink type, W shaped soliton and many other solitary wave solutions. At the end, we checked integrability of the model through Painleve analysis and found that this model is not completely integrable. To the best of our knowledge, no one studied MTs model for multiple soliton, soliton molecules with the aid of extended (G�∕G) -expansion method and Painleve analysis. So we can say that all of our results are new and novel."
