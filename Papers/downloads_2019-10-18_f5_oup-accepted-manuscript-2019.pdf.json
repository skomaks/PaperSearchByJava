      "heading" : "INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "The aortic arch with a common origin of the innominate and left carotid artery (CILCA) is commonly known, and thus far reported in the literature, as the misnomer ‘bovine arch’ [1]. It represents the second most common arch configuration in the population following the standard pattern that consists in a brachiocephalic trunk, a left common carotid and a left subclavian artery originating from the aortic arch [2]. A less common variant, defined as ‘type 2 bovine arch’ [3], occurs when the left common carotid artery originates directly from the innominate artery rather than as a common trunk (Fig. 1).\nThe prevalence of the CILCA arch in the general population is 13.6%, with relevant difference among ethnicities, being more frequent in African populations (i.e. 26.8%) and less frequent in Asiatic populations (i.e. 7.5%) [2]. The real prevalence of this configuration, however, is likely to be underestimated, being CILCA arch largely unreported in radiological studies [4, 5] because of the presumed negligible consequences of this finding.\nThe clinical relevance of the CILCA arch has become apparent in planning surgical and endovascular procedures involving the aortic arch [6, 7]. Its reputation as a benign anatomical variant has been ultimately shattered by further studies [3, 4, 8, 9] that identified the CILCA arch as a potential marker for thoracic aortic disease (TAD). In fact, controversial data are available regarding the association between a CILCA arch and a TAD [10, 11], and the prognostic value of this configuration remains to be established [10]. Also, the mechanisms potentially underlying the development of TAD in subjects with a CILCA arch represent a largely unaddressed issue [9].\nThe aim of this work was to perform a systematic review of the literature on the association between CILCA arch and TAD, and assess the value of this anatomical variant as a determinant of pathological derangements of the aortic wall."

I2 values of 25%, 50% and 75% were considered as representing low, medium and high heterogeneity, respectively [13].\nConsidering the heterogeneity in patient populations of the different studies, the random-effects model was used as the model of choice. The combined ORs and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and reported in the Forest plot. The risk of potential publication bias was evaluated by visually inspecting the Funnel plot and performing the Egger test [14].\nThe pooled proportion of TAD among patients with and without CILCA arch with the respective 95% CIs was calculated using a proportion meta-analysis random-effects model.\nTwo-sided P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant."

Three studies reported on the same case series from the Yale University [4, 16, 18], and therefore only one of these [16] was included in the meta-analysis.\nAmong the type of aortic disease, 1 study included only aortic aneurysm [8], 4 studies [3, 4, 16, 17] reported both on aneurysm and dissections, and 2 of them included also aortic rupture and intramural haematoma [4, 16], and 5 focused only on dissections [9–11, 15, 18].\nAnatomical subvariants type 1 and type 2 CILCA were considered only in 2 studies [3, 10], and one of them reported a prevalence of type 2 CILCA in patients with TAD [3].\nTwo manuscripts from the same group [4, 16] reported an earlier onset of TAD in CILCA arch patients, who also underwent initial aortic operation at a younger age, compared to patients without CILCA, and were less frequently affected with cardiovascular risk factors, like hypertension. Also, the presence of a bicuspid valve, which is well-established to be associated with ascending aortopathy and often coexists with the CILCA arch,\nFigure 2: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) chart. aText not in English, reviews, commentaries, case reports, studies exclusively reporting other arch anomalies, studies exclusively reporting interventional and surgical implications of common origin of the innominate and left carotid artery. bCommon origin of the innominate and left carotid artery prevalence in thoracic aortic disease was not analysed, lacking outcome of interest, insufficient or unextractable data.\nR EV\nIE W\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ejcts/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/ejcts/ezz277/5588529 by guest on 18 O ctober 2019\nwas not found to be a confounding factor for the association between CILCA arch and TAD in the same studies (P = 0.72 and P = 0.119, respectively) [4, 16].\nRegarding the location of the aortic disease, the arch was found to be the most common site for both aneurysm development (P = 0.003) [8], and entry tears formation in dissections [18, 19] (P = 0.043 and P < 0.001, respectively).\nFinally, from a prognostic point of view, CILCA arch was found to be associated with an increased risk of mortality [10], and adverse neurological events in patients with aortic dissections [18, 19].\nEight studies [3, 8–11, 15–17] reported adequate information for the quantitative analysis, and their characteristics are reported in Table 1. The number of events considered for evaluating the risk difference of developing TAD in CILCA versus non-CILCA arches is reported in Table 2.\nThe proportion of TAD among patients with CILCA arch was higher [41.5% (28.1–56.4)] than the proportion in subjects with standard arch configuration [34.0% (20.1–51.4)].\nThe Forest plot is reported in Fig. 3.

      "heading" : "DISCUSSION",
      "text" : "Our work provides evidence to identify the CILCA arch variant as a risk factor for the development of TAD. Hence, our findings warrant a heightened awareness of the predictive relevance of this anatomical variant, which mandates a consistent citation of the presence of a CILCA arch in diagnostic imaging reports [4]. Also, a specific surveillance protocol should be established for patients presenting with a CILCA arch, in order to possibly prevent the development of TAD complications in a timely manner [16]. In this respect, the suggested prognostic value of this anatomical configuration [10, 18, 19] may dictate a specific treatment algorithm in patients with aortic dissections [9], and an early treatment in patients with aortic aneurysm [8], as for subjects with connective tissue disorders.\nThe predisposing mechanism by which a CILCA arch is prone to TAD development remains to be identified, and deserves further studies. Current pathophysiological hypotheses include genetical defects (i.e. deletion in chromosome 22q11) [20], embryological derangements [21] and ill-defined haemodynamic mechanisms [9, 15, 22].\nSpecifically, it was proposed that the aortic wall may be weaken as a result of congenital structural defects [20] or altered neural cell migration [21], but more recent histological studies failed to find any relevant mechanical and failure properties that may entail an increased risk of aortic rupture in CILCA arch [23, 24].\nAccording to another hypothesis, the relatively greater diameter of the arch vessels may alter the local flow haemodynamics, leading to an increased wall shear stress, with the inherent detrimental effects on the aortic wall [9, 15]. In fact, it is likely that other peculiar geometric features of the CILCA arch, consistent with other anatomical configurations particularly prevalent in patients with TAD [25], entail a local biomechanical environment that adversely affects the aortic wall properties and its integrity. Yet, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the onset of aneurysm and dissections are different, and the proposed\nTable 1: Eligible studies and their descriptive characteristics\nAuthors Country Patients with CILCA/TAD (%) Age Gender M/F (%) Type of TAD Type I/type II CILCA in TAD (%)\nMalone et al.

Notably, different studies reported a trend towards an increased risk of post-TEVAR mortality [9, 10] and complications, namely retrograde dissection [9, 26], in patients with CILCA arch. Hence, specific studies on the impact of the CICLA configuration on TEVAR planning appear warranted.\nFinally, the matter of the nomenclature of the CILCA arch remains, in our opinion, an incompletely resolved issue. The recent STORAGE guidelines [1] recommend abandoning the term ‘bovine’, and suggest the use of a descriptive terminology. This approach, however, on one hand appears unpractical in scientific reports, considering the word count restraints adopted by peerreviewed journals, and particularly for titles and abstracts. On the other hand, it may hamper the establishment of the CILCA arch as a specific anatomical configuration with a peculiar prognostic relevance, and jeopardize the desired consistency in scientific citation."
