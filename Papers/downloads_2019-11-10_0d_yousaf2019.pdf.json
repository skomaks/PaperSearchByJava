The prepared n-CuO-pNiO-n-ZnO nanoparticles and their hybrids with rGO were characterized by various characterization techniques. Structural, optical and morphological characterization was done by X-rays diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), UV–Visible spectroscopy etc. It was found that the developed hetero-structure is composed by pNiO as cubic, n-CuO as monoclinic and n-ZnO as hexagonal crystal structure. Formation of heterojunction is confirmed by current-voltage (I-V) measurement. The optical bandgap energy of heterojunction was around 1.6 eV which made this system active in both UV and Visible light region. Photocatalytic degradation efficiency was examined using methylene blue and it showed prominent enhancement as compared to pure metal oxides. This excellent efficiency was attributed due to efficient charge carrier separation which leads to inhibit recombination rate at photocatalyst interface. Moreover, photocatalytic activity was increased meaningfully up to 70% by graphene based n-CuO-p-NiO-n-ZnO. This excellent increment in activity was due to large surface area offered by graphene which caused adsorption of dye molecules and helped in transfer of electrons to metal conduction band."

      "text" : "Now-a-days, the increase in environmental pollution is becoming a serious issue along with many other common issues worldwide. Water pollution is one of the major types of environmental pollution. The aquatic pollution contains a variety of pollutants. Each type of pollutant needs a different strategy to overcome. There are three main types of water pollutants. These are pathogens, heavy metals and organic compounds. Researchers have been attracted to develop materials for treatment of various industrial wastes that contain a number of organic pollutants such as dyes etc. These pollutants are damaging our environment and aquatic life badly. Various methods being used to treat industrial and household water such as reverse osmosis, electrochemical, coagulation, ozonolysis, ion exchange and membrane processes etc. [1,2]. Among all of these methods use of semiconductor photocatalyst is considered to be a green and effective way to degrade pollutants. Nickel oxide nanomaterials belong to such class of\nsemiconductor materials which are extensively used for electro-catalytic oxidation, super-capacitor, energy production, dye sensitized solar cells, fuel cells, hydrogen evolution reactions, in-vitro cytotoxicity, antibacterial and photocatalytic applications [3–6]. Photocatalytic performance of a photocatalyst can be tailored by tuning its band gap energy, superficial region and ability to setup photogenerated electrons and holes. Nickel oxide is a p-type semiconductor and shows extraordinary optical, electrical and photocatalytic applications [7]. Fazlali et al. synthesized nickel oxide nanoparticles and studied effect of morphology on photocatalytic activity. They found that spherical, uniform, homogeneous and highly mono-disperse particles shows> 80% degradation under UV illumination [8]. A number of such metals and metal oxide photocatalysts are available that only show response in UV region due to high bandgap [9–11]. In order to lower the bandgap and electron-hole recombination various strategies were adopted such as metal or nonmetal ion doping and formation of solid solution. Among all of these strategies, the formation of solid solution with phase\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.352 Received 17 May 2019; Received in revised form 29 May 2019; Accepted 31 May 2019\n∗ Corresponding author. ∗∗ Corresponding author.

Due to high band gap energy nickel oxide will only absorb a narrow region of sunlight spectrum and remaining spectrum of light will remains useless. In addition, improvement in nickel oxide nanoparticles can be made by making its composites along with other materials [12–18]. Zhang et al. synthesize ZnO/NiO nanocomposite and found that, composite effectively completely degraded dye within 3 h with band gap equals to 3.0 eV. Various Cu and Ni based binary heterojunction nanocomposites were also synthesized and characterized [19,20]. High catalytic activity of NiO/ZnO nanocomposite was due to formation of p-n heterojunction [21]. Chen et al. synthesized TiO2MnO2 biphasic nanocomposite with photocatalytic response in UV region [22]. NiO/TiO2 was synthesized by Faisal et al. [23]. Alsheri et al. fabricated NiO/SnO2 nanomaterial that showed promising photocatalytic activity in UV region due to formation of p-n heterojunction with bandgap 3.52 [24]. NiO/γAl2O3 exhibited up to 85% degradation [16]. Although, single heterojunction systems are good, however they suffer for various problems. These problems can be addressed by double heterojunction system approach. There are several reports on double heterojunction systems found in the literature. For example, Wang et al. fabricated and studied photocatalytic activity of ZnO/ZnWO4/WO3. It was found that the proposed double heterojunction system exhibit better performance. As major part of solar radiations coming to earth is visible light therefore we need such a catalyst that is active in whole spectrum of solar light. Juma et al. [25] synthesized and characterized n-CuO-p-NiO-n-ZnO ternary nanocomposite. They found that bandgap energy of synthesized compound was 1.68 eV that made it suitable for degradation activity. Graphene is a 2D material with extremely high surface area and many other extraordinary features. It has been reported for a wide range of applications including tailoring the photocatalytic activity of metal oxide semiconductors. This high surface area of graphene enhances its ability to adsorb targeted molecules and also acts as an electrical contact between semiconductor photocatalyst. Graphene, being highly conducting in nature, is responsible to transfer the photo-excited electrons in conduction band of oxides of metals [26,27]. Pham et al. synthesized nickel incorporated titanium dioxide/ graphene oxide nanocomposite and found an excellent photocatalyst due to narrowing of band gap energy [28]. NiO is a p-type semiconductor and CuO and ZnO is n-type semiconductor. When these are taken in contact with each other, it results in the formation of double pn heterojunction. This heterojunction will create an internal electric field, known as depletion region, along the interface. When this heterojunction is illuminated to light energy, electrons will be transfer to n-region of junction and holes will transfer to p-region. Due to this reason, electron hole recombination will be reduced and in other terms photocatalytic efficiency will be increases.\nIn the present study, synthesis and photocatalytic activity of pure nCuO, p-NiO, n-ZnO, n-CuO-p-NiO-n-ZnO and their hybrids with rGO was studied. Significant enhancement in photocatalytic activity was observed in graphene based n-CuO-p-NiO-n-ZnO heterojunction due to adsorption of dye molecules on the surface of Graphene and easy transfer of electrons to metal conduction band. This study has not been reported earlier according to the best of our knowledge."

XRD diffraction patterns are presented in Fig. 2. The peaks at 2θ=35.6°, 38.93°, 48.51°, 53.44°, 59.2°, 61.74°, 65.48° and 68.32° are assigned to (ī11), (111), (2̅02), (020), (202), (ī13), (022) and (220) lattice planes (JCPDS no. 00-001-1117) of monoclinic crystalline structure of n-CuO. Diffraction peaks at 2θ=37.21°, 43.23° and 62.82° were due to (111), (200) and (220) lattice planes of Cubic crystalline structure of p-NiO (JCPDS no. 01-078- 0423).

In the case nCuO-p-NiO-n-ZnO, peaks at 2θ=38.73° and 66.27° are due to (111) and (022) lattice planes of CuO, whereas peaks at 2θ=42.94° and 62.61° correspond to (200) and (220) lattice planes of NiO, while peaks at 2θ=31.82°, 34.28°, 36.12°, 47.38°, 56.46°, 62.61°, 66.27°, 67.85° and 68.96° relates to the lattice planes of ZnO respectively. The crystallite size of pure n-CuO, p-NiO, n-ZnO and CuO, NiO, ZnO in ternary nanocomposite were calculated by using Debye-Sherrer equation [32]\n(2).\n=D Kλ βcosθ (2)\nIn this equation “D” is crystallite size, “K” is Sherrer's constant and equal to 0.9, “λ” is wavelength of X-rays used during experiment and corresponded to CuKα 1.5406 Å, “θ” is Bragg's angle while “β” is full width at half maxima (FWHM). According to Debye-Sherrer method, crystallite size of n-CuO was 6.52 nm and 14.64 nm, p-NiO was 14.62 and 7.6 nm and n-ZnO was 23.30 and 30.4 nm in pure and composite respectively.\nSimilarly, the crystallite size of pure n-CuO, p-NiO, n-ZnO and CuO, NiO, ZnO in double heterojunction was also calculated by WilliamsonHall plot method using eq.

Through the intercept of straight line, crystallite size is calculated whereas slope gives the value of microstrain as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. According to Williamson-Hall plot method, crystallite size of pure n-CuO was 5.09 nm, pure p-NiO was 16.49 nm and pure n-ZnO was 28.70 nm. Crystallite size of CuO was 12.29 nm; NiO was 6.18 nm and ZnO 27.42 nm in double heterojunction respectively as given in Table 1. In comparison of crystallite size calculated from two different methods, it was found that both methods give almost the same results while Scherer method gives slightly larger size. It was due to presence of different geometries of particles. On the other hand CuO showed negative microstrain that corresponded to shrinkage of its lattice whereas lattice strain in ZnO crystal lattice was much higher in pure and double heterojunction. Microstrain in CuO crystal lattice was calculated to be −0.00921 and −0.00212 in pure and double heterojunction respectively [34]. The irregularity in the crystal system was calculated in terms of dislocation density by using equation number 5 [35,36].\n=δ D 1 2 (5)\nThe lowest values of dislocation density represent regularity in crystal system.

Reduction of GO to rGO can simply checked by matching the position of absorption maximum peaks of GO and rGO. Graphite oxide showed maximum absorption peak at 228 nm which arose due to π to π* transition of aromatic carbon frame and a weak shoulder peak at 304 nm is due to n- π* transition of C˭˭˭O bond [43]. UV–Visible spectrum of rGO showed absorption maximum peak at 268 nm, the red shifting of maximum absorption peak confirmed the reduction of GO to rGO [44]."

The direct and indirect bandgap of p-NiO was 2.78 eV and 3.35 eV respectively [47,48] as given in Fig. 7 (b).

The photocatalytic activity of pure n-CuO, p-NiO and n-ZnO photocatalysts was also conducted under the same conditions. Fig. 13 showed the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue by prepared different photocatalysts materials. MB did not degrade without photocatalyst either under light or in dark. The photocatalytic degradation of MB was very poor in the presence of p-NiO as compared to that of n-CuO-p-NiO-nZnO/rGO nano-hybrids. This is because the bandgap energy of NiO is quite high i.e. 3.35 eV. This bandgap correspond to UV light [50–52]. Similar case was with CuO nanoparticles [53,54]. ZnO showed very weak photocatalytic response [55]. Photocatalytic activity of n-CuO-pNiO-n-ZnO double heterojunction is better than that of pure n-CuO, pNiO and n-ZnO. This increased in photocatalytic activity was attributed due to lowering of bandgap energy up to 1.6 eV. After addition of rGO, the photocatalytic degradation efficiency increased further. This increased photocatalytic activity by rGO may be attributed to the following reasons. The first reason is that, the rGO provided a larger surface area to get adsorbed the MB molecules by π to π stacking [56]. The rGO sheets have significantly low Fermi levels. Therefore the graphene could play a vital role in controlling the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs. The combined effect of rGO and double hetero-junction increased the photocatalytic activity of the prepared nano-hybrids. Fig. 13(e) showed the progress of photo degradation of MB for n-CuO-p-NiO-n-ZnO/rGO. It can be noticed that the intensity of\nthe absorption peaks at 664 nm decreased with irradiation time. It was also observed that the peaks almost disappeared when the photocatalytic degradation for MB was passed out for 60min. In order to make a supplementary investigation on photocatalytic process, the kinetic performance of photocatalytic degradation was also carried out. The kinetic process of photo-catalysis is described by pseudo-first-order reaction equation [57,58].\n= C C ln Kto t (7)\nIn this equation, “C0” is concentration of MB at time t= 0 and “Ct” is concentration of MB at time t= t, “k” is the rate constant and is expressed in unit min−1. The appropriate results of photocatalytic MB\ndegradation are shown in Fig. 14 and Table 2. It can be seen from the results that the n-CuO-p-NiO-n-ZnO/rGO has the fastest rate constant (k= 0.0176 min−1)."

      "text" : "In order to detect the main reactive species and predict photocatalytic reaction mechanism, the trapping experiments were executed throughout the photocatalytic process for the degradation of methylene blue. In the study, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 2-propanol, silver nitrate and ascorbic acid were used as hole (h+), hydroxyl radical (∗OH), electrons (e−) [59] and superoxide anion radical scavenger (∗O2−2) respectively [60]. The variation of MB degradation by CuONiO-ZnO/rGO composite with different scavenges are presented in\nFig. 15. When 0.01 g of EDTA as h+ scavenger was added, the photocatalytic activity of composite was 10%, indicating that h+ was involved in the photocatalytic process. Moreover, the photodegradation\nof MB was also reserved to 8.7%, when 0.01 g of silver nitrate was added as e− scavenger, telling that e− was also the noticeable active species for the degradation of MB. In addition, when the 2-propanol as ∗OH scavenger was added into the system, the degradation of MB was also depressed to 10%, indicating that ∗OH was also involved in the photocatalytic process However, when ascorbic acid as ∗O2−2 scavenger was added into the reaction system, the photocatalytic activity of n-CuO-p-NiO-n-ZnO/rGO composite for degradation of MB was not obviously changed, denoting that .O2−2 had very small or no contribution to the photodegradation of MB. The above results exposed that the photogenerated hole (h+), hydroxyl radical (*OH) and electrons (e−) were the main reactive species for the degradation of MB during the degradation reaction.\nScheme 1, shows proposed photocatalytic degradation mechanism\nbased on experimental results. It is well known fact that rGO behaves as a photosensitizers as well as is liable for the greater absorption in visible region in semiconductor photocatalysis. Due to this universal property of rGO, photocatalytic performance further increases. The conduction band edge and valence band edge energy of CuO, NiO and ZnO is calculated by equations (8) and (9) [61].\n= − −E X E 1 2 ECB e g (8)\nECB=EVB - Eg (9)\nIn these equations, “EVB” is the valence band edge potential, “ECB” is the conduction band edge potentials, “X” is the electronegativity (CuO is 6.0, NiO is 5.0 and ZnO is 5.9), “Ee” is the energy of free electrons on the basis of Hydrogen scale (4.5 eV) and “Eg” is the optical band gap energy (CuO is 3.09 eV, NiO is 3.35 eV and ZnO is 2.94 eV). By using above stated equatons, “EVB” for CuO, NiO and ZnO was 3.055 eV, 2.89 eV and 2.19 and “ECB” for CuO, NiO and ZnO was −0.003, −0.04 eV and −1.17eV, respectively. The photocatalytic activity is because of creation of double p-n-junction between n-type CuO, p-type NiO and n-type ZnO. Based on the schematic, this p-n hetero-junction forms the electrons and holes in p-NiO and n-ZnO and n-CuO. When photocatalyst was exposed to visible light, photo-excitation of electrons takes place. The interfacial contact between metal oxides is responsible for transfer of photogenerated electrons from more negative conduction band of NiO to less negative conduction band of CuO and ZnO. Similarly, transmission of photogenerated holes from more positive valence band of CuO and ZnO to less positive valence band of NiO takes place. These result in separation of e−-h+ efficiently across the heterojunction. The transmitted electrons from conduction band of NiO to conduction band of CuO and ZnO are not able to produce superoxide anion radicle from dissolved oxygen due to more positive conduction band edge energy of CuO and ZnO than reduction potential of O2 to *O2−2. However, these electrons could yield hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which on exposure to light and electrons degraded to ∗OH radicals. These highly oxidizing ∗OH radicals degraded dye molecules to CO2 and H2O. In contrast photogenerated holes in valence band of NiO are also unable to create ∗OH radicals from OH− anion and water because of more positive reduction potential of H2O to ∗OH and OH− to ∗OH radical. So these are only responsible for directly degradation of organic pollutant. The overall reaction mechanism is given in equation\n(10)–(18) [62].\n− − − − − +\n→ − − − − − + − +\nn CuO p NiO n ZnO/rGO hv\nn CuO p NiO n ZnO(e h )cb vb (10)\n→ − −NiO(e ) CuO(e )cb cb (11)\n→ − −NiO(e ) ZnO(e )cb cb (12)\n→ + +CuO(h ) NiO(h )vb vb (13)\n→ + +ZnO(h ) NiO(h )vb vb (14)\n+ + → − +CuO(e ) H O H Ocb 2 2 2 (15)\n+ + → − +ZnO(e ) H O H Ocb 2 2 2 (16)\n+ + → + − −H O e hv O H OH2 2 * (17)\n+ + → +O H h organic pollutants Degradation products(CO and H O)* 2 2\n(18)\nTherefore, It could be concluded that ∗OH radical and holes behaves as main active species during photocatalytic degradation process. Furthermore, Table 1 shows the percent degradation and rate constant values."

      "text" : "In this work, we have fabricated n-CuO-p-NiO-n-ZnO double heterojunction by using co-precipitation approach and exposed them as active photocatalyst for removal of organic pollutant from contaminated water under visible light irradiation. Structural and morphological characterization was done by XRD, FTIR and UV–Visible spectroscopy. XRD results confirmed the formation of CuO (crystallized in monoclinic unit cell), NiO (crystallized in Cubic unit cell) and ZnO (crystalized in hexagonal unit cell) phases in triphase composite. Futher XRD results are supported by FTIR data. UV–Visible spectroscopic analysis expressed the absorption peaks for Zn-O, Ni-O and Cu-O bond in ternary composite. Bandgap energy of heterojunction is red shifted to 1.6 eV that corresponds to visible light. This heterojunction showed superior photocatalytic activity than those of pure n-CuO, p-NiO and nZnO nanoparticles by four folds. n-CuO-p-NiO-n-ZnO heterojunction yielded 40% degradation within 60min under visible light. However, Graphene based n-CuO-p-NiO-n-ZnO heterojunction gives 70%\nScheme 1. Schematic illustration of degradation of methylene blue by graphene based photocatalyst.\ndegradation within 60min under visible light. Various scavengers were used to detect active species in degradation experiment. It was found that electrons, holes and hydroxyl radicles have significant effect on photocatalysis whereas superoxide radicles are not directly or indirectly influencing Photocatalysis. These promising results opened a new avenue for researchers to work in semiconductor based photocatalysts."

The prepared n-CuO-pNiO-n-ZnO nanoparticles and their hybrids with rGO were characterized by various characterization techniques. Structural, optical and morphological characterization was done by X-rays diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), UV–Visible spectroscopy etc. It was found that the developed hetero-structure is composed by pNiO as cubic, n-CuO as monoclinic and n-ZnO as hexagonal crystal structure. Formation of heterojunction is confirmed by current-voltage (I-V) measurement. The optical bandgap energy of heterojunction was around 1.6 eV which made this system active in both UV and Visible light region. Photocatalytic degradation efficiency was examined using methylene blue and it showed prominent enhancement as compared to pure metal oxides. This excellent efficiency was attributed due to efficient charge carrier separation which leads to inhibit recombination rate at photocatalyst interface. Moreover, photocatalytic activity was increased meaningfully up to 70% by graphene based n-CuO-p-NiO-n-ZnO. This excellent increment in activity was due to large surface area offered by graphene which caused adsorption of dye molecules and helped in transfer of electrons to metal",
