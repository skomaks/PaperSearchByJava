This study demonstrated the application of curcumin capped gold loaded poly (lactic-coglycolic acid) nanoparticles (CAu-PLGA Nps) for the inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy by preserving myocardial functions of Wister rat model. Rat models were arbitrarily divided into five groups and observation period was 10 weeks; 1. Control 2. Enalopril (EP), an hypertropic agent induced group 3. EP and Curcumin (C) 4. EP and Curcumin capped gold (CAu) Nps and 5. EP and CAu-PLGA Nps injected group. CAu-PLGA Nps was first synthesized from double emulsion-solvent evaporation method and were characterized by its adoptable techniques such as FT-IR, XRD, SEM and TEM analysis. These analyses demonstrate the encapsulation of curcumin capped gold nanoparticles into PLGA there confirms the successful synthesis of CAu-PLGA Nps. Animals studies illustrates that the CAu-PLGA Nps has significantly produced cardiac anti-hypertrophy and drug delivery when compared to the other groups. CAu-PLGA Nps exhibit increased survival rate, improved cardiac functions like cardiac systolic and diastolic function, maintaining heart weight and left ventricle pressure at the controlled level. Beneficiary activities of CAu-PLGA Nps were associated with its cardiovascular functions like anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, controls cardiomycete growth, increased drug delivery, prevents accumulation of cholesterol and prevents myocardial infarction."

      "text" : "Physiological or pathophysiological events like over exerted exercise, hypertension, and increased stress are the main induced factors of cardiac hypertrophy of human beings [1]. Further, natural disasters, motor vehicle accidents, anomalous anger, abnormal weather condition, infections, air pollution also triggers cardiac hypertrophy thereby provokes heart attack [2]. Nearly 31% of deaths in globe caused by cardiovascular disease which interprets that more people lost lives by cardiac disease and stands as first cause for global death of people [3].\nA significant percentage of death by cardiac hypertrophy occurred during maternity of women [4]. Despite progresses in medical care, various natural and synthetic materials or drugs accommodates to reduce cardiac hypertrophy [5–7]. In current circumstances, many researchers attempted analytical investigations to avoid or reduce cardiac hypertrophy by employing significant properties on human cardiac system with biocompatibility. Hence increasing interests on research on natural products associated with minimal side effects, non-toxic and biocompatible has been widely explored for pharmaceutical applications especially for cardiac anti-hypertrophy [8].

All rights reserved.\nT\nproducts like Green tea, Garlic, European elder, Cranberry, Golden seal, Hawthorn have been effectively used to design cardiovascular drugs with unfortunate various minimal side effects like risk of bleeding, dieresis etc. which sometimes exceeds its benefits [9–14].\nNatural products with polyphenolic component are the appealing material for anti-cardiac hypertrophy due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, drug carrier activity, nought side effects and their role to act as reducing enlargement of heart muscles [15,16]. Among the various natural products with polyphenolic moiety, Curcumin have become more prominent as anti-cardiac hypertrophy drug. Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound that exerts a diferuloylmethane which is the main constitutent of Curcuma longa, commonly called as turmeric that has been widely used in many countries to treat regarding inflammatory diseases [17,18]. Literature studies reports that Curcumin evidences its treatment in medical field due to their promising features that anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial activities etc. [19–21]. These factors generated its appliance to treat cancer, inflammatory disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, wound healing and cardiac hypertrophy [22–27]. Though it has attractive medicinal properties, it also accumulates restricted pharmacological attributes such as poor water solubility i.e. hydrophobic nature, low bioavailability, low aqueous solubility at specific conditions, rapid metabolism, and expressive hydrolysis in basic medium and light instability [28]. Physicochemical limitations of curcumin can be conquered to increase its functional ability by binding or loading with nanocarriers such as liposomes [29], cyclodextrins [30], chitosan [31], peptides [32], lipids [33], polymer like poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) [34], polylactic acid (PLA) [35], polycaprolactone [36] and also inorganic nanoparticles like silver [37], selenium [38], platinum [39], iron oxide [40], cerium oxide [41] etc. have been reported especially to enhance beneficial effects in multiple pathological conditions to treat cardiovascular diseases.\nGold nanoparticles (Au Nps) is an emerging anti-cardiac hypertrophy drug with biocompatible nature, good electrical conductivity, chemical stability and low toxicity [42]. Au Nps has been widely used in medical field for drug delivery, tissue engineering, anticancer, photothermal theraphy, gene delivery, biosensor, bioimaging, since it can bind easily with a variety of organic compounds [43]. Moreover, it assesses tunable physical and chemical properties, destroys pathogens thereby increases the efficiency of drugs. Therapeutic applications of metal (e.g., Au, Ag, etc.,) nanoparticles are mainly attributed for its characteristic features i.e. the gold core is inert, prepared functionalization, photophysical properties which triggers drug release at the targeted place. Encapsulation of drugs with polymer loaded Au Nps has been widely studied nowadays as nanocarrier to enhance therapeutic ability of drugs [44]. Traditional polymers applied for drug delivery such as polyethylene glycol, polyacrylates, polysiloxanes accumulates certain drawbacks like non-biodegradable and low solubility [45]. These paved the way for biodegradable, biocompatible, in-vivo degradative synthetic polymers like poly (lacto-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polyanhydrides, polyethylene glycol since natural polymers like chitosan, hydroxyapatites has downside effects [46]. Among many biodegradable polymeric materials, PLGA received payable attention towards medical field because of its unique physical, chemical, mechanical and biological properties such as biocompatibility, renewability, process capability, sustained release of drugs, practiceable surface modification of drugs, targeting specific organs, protecting drugs from degradation and extreme biodegrability in aqueous medium [47]. It has been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicine Agency for its usage in biomedical, clinical, drug delivery and injury management system [48]. It has been successful studied for the delivery of proteins, peptides and plasmid DNA [49]. Moreover, PLGA loaded with nanostructures improves its biological efficiencies like increased drug entrapment and cellular penetration. Many reports deal with the synthesis of PLGA nanostructures by evaporation method, emulsification, precipitation and solvent evaporation protocols [50]. In\nthe current study, curcumin capped gold loaded Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (CAu-PLGA Nps) has been developed as efficient curcumin drug carrier for improved cardiac anti-hypertrophy activity by enhancing its solubility and bioavailability compared to its original state with a rat model of induced cardiac hypertrophy."

Similarly stock solution of HAuCl4 of concentration 10mM was prepared using Milli-Q water. Preparation of curcumin capped gold nanoparticles (CAu Nps) was carried out using different concentrations of curcumin varying from 0.25mM to 2mM with the intervals of 0.25mM and HAuCl4 varying from 0.5mM to 4mM with the intervals of 0.5mM to find the optimum concentration for high efficient capping of curcumin. In this procedure, about 0.5 mM solution of HAuCl4 was added dropwise with simultaneous stirring to 0.25mM curcumin solution which was diluted using Milli-Q water by maintaining the pH of 8 using NaOH solution. The reaction mixture was allowed to stirring for about 3–4 h until the solution colour turns from yellow to red. After that, the solution was allowed to stand for one day at room temperature followed by centrifugation at a speed of 15,000 rpm at a temperature of 25 °C. The formed particles was washed many times with acetone followed by water to remove any unreacted curcumin. Finally purified Cu-CAu Np was dried at room temperature and stored in a dessicator to avoid interacting with moisture content and for further use."

      "text" : "The phase purity of the incorporated components and nano-crystallinity of the prepared samples were examined using XRD analytical technique. The successful formation of crystalline Au and Curcumin demonstrates its XRD pattern (Fig. 1Aa and b) with the nature of semi crystalline nature. The peaks characteristic of curcumin is clearly visible in the case of CAu Nps (Fig. 1Ac) and new peaks at 2θ value of 38.3°, 44.4° and 64.2° corresponds to (111) (200) (220) Bragg reflection planes are characteristic of cubic Au, confirms the binding of curcumin with Au. The crystallite size determined for the highly intense peak using Scherrer's equation is 43 nm. Crystallinity nature and intensity is highly decreased in CAu-PLGA Nps (Fig. 1Ac) due to the encapsulation of amorphous PLGA with CAu Nps thereby decreases the crystalline property. This ascertains the successful and efficient loading of CAu with PLGA nanoparticles. FT-IR analysis was performed to find the capping of gold and successive conjugation of PLGA with the CAu Nps. Fig. 1B shows the FT-IR spectra of curcumin, CAu Nps and CAu-PLGA Nps. The spectrum of curcumin shows three characteristic bands at 1382, 1237 and 961 cm−1 which are attributed to bending vibrations of the –OH group of two phenolic groups and an enolic moiety respectively. Disappearance of these three bands in the case of CAu Nps spectrum confirms the binding of gold at these active sites. This confirms that phenolic –OH moiety of curcumin reduces HAuCl4 to Au0. Moreover, it stabilizes the Au nanoparticles by performing as a capping agent. A new peak at 630 cm−1 could be assigned to the interaction of Au with the oxygen of curcumin. Similarly, appearance of peak\ncharacteristic of ester linkage at 1759 cm−1 in CAu-PLGA Nps spectrum substantiates the effective loading or conjugating of curcumin with PLGA. All three samples shows common bands or peaks at around 775 and 1420 cm−1 corresponds to the double bond in-plane bending vibrations of the heptadiene chain of curcumin. Moreover, aromatic –C=C-C vibration and CH3 vibration appeared at 1020 and 1445 cm−1. These common peaks indicate that there is no interaction of alkadiene chain and aromatic ring with Au as well as PLGA. Hence it confirms the presence of curcumin as a capping agent and interaction of only phenolic groups with Au and PLGA nanoparticles."

      "text" : "Thermal study of the prepared samples was carried out to examine the binding of both Au and PLGA with curcumin. All three samples shows only endothermic peaks. In the TGA curve of curcumin (Fig. 2), there is no significant weight loss upto 100 °C and a gradual decrease in weight upto 200 °C due to the adsorption of moisture content. After 300 °C, decomposition of curcumin occurs and completely decomposed at 600 °C. Thermogram of CAu Nps almost similar to the decomposition path of curcumin whereas there in no complete decomposition due to\nthe binding of Au Nps whose thermal stability is above 1000 °C. Similarly TGA curve of CAu-PLGA Nps also shows a rapid decrease in weight after 250 °C. This may accumulate due to the decomposition of PLGA since it has low thermal stability. At the end of 600 °C, there is no matter left behind for curcumin means that 100% weight loss, but in the case of CAu Nps and CAu-PLGA shows only about 80% and 90% weight loss due to the remaining matter of gold particles.\nUV–Vis spectral analysis also carried out to add evidence for the successful preparation of the CAu Nps and CAu-PLGA Nps. UV–Vis spectrum (Fig. 2B) exhibit the characteristic peak of CAu Nps at about 555 nm which coincidence well the reported literature [56]. After the encapsulation of CAu Nps into PLGA, the intensity of the prepared nanoparticles is highly decreased due to the polymeric nature of PLGA.

No one rat was affected in the control group during the observation period. EP injected group was\nrapidly affected almost 70% (4–6) leaded to transience. Treatment with curcumin alone exhibit 50% of the group affected but (3–6) reduced the mortality of about 20% from the cardiac hypertension induced by EP. But the survival rate of CAu NPs treated group has been increased to 66% which is highly comparable with 30% survival rate of EP treated group and also attributed to the cause that gold nanoparticles acts as proficient drug carrier and also increases curcumin availability to treat affected heart. In the case of CAu-PLGA NPs treated group enormously increased the survival rate of about 85% (5–6), extremely significant in contrast to other groups. This illustrates the efficient encapsulation of CAu NPs by PLGA thereby increases its solubility. Moreover, PLGA slowly releases the drug thereby increases curcumin probation period which attributes for the effectiveness of CAu-PLGA NPs to perform as enhanced cardiac anti-hypertrophy drug.\nExtent of cardiac hypertrophy can be examined from the heart weight of tested animals. Fig. 4 (B) illustrates the chart regarding HW/ BW ratio of tested groups. Negligible change only observed in the case\nof control group which means that the tested animal is in consistent health condition during the observation period. Stimulation of cardiac hypertrophy by EP can be confirmed from increase in HW/BW to about 15%. Provision of curcumin demonstrates only 8% increase which explains its activity to reduce the cardiac toxicity by EP. This proves that the curcumin can act as an efficient cardiac anti-hypertrophy drug as\nreported in literature that it suppresses oxidative stress by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Employment of CAu Nps and CAuPLGA Nps further reduces the increase in HW/BW ratio. This attributes the capping of curcumin with Au and encapsulation with PLGA brings the curcumin to the right target due to the presence of anionic charge in CAu-PLGA Nps and also increases the contribution of drug availability\nand solubility. Fig. 5A and B represents the images of heart and cross sections of myocardium stained by H & E. Images of heart also illustrates that the heart weight increased after injected with EP. Increase of heart weight is prohibited after treatment of curcumin loaded samples. Alteration of histological architecture is not observed in the control group. EP injected group shows alteration and degenerated in myocardium and also represent necrosis i.e. death of cells which means that EP induces cardiac hypertrophy. Curcumin treated group shows slight improvement than EP group. But the combined effect of CAu Nps shows enhanced histological structure without any significant alteration than curcumin alone. Improved histological architecture is observed for CAu-PLGA Nps as like the structure of control group without any alterations which implies that it acted efficiently to reduce cardiac hypertrophy. Cross sectional area (CSA) of the group tested by CAu-PLGA Nps is almost comparable with the control group (Fig. 5C) as like the results obtained for HW/BW ratio."

From the images, it is clearly understood that EP injected group shows increase in both LVES and LVED (Fig. 6B) than the control group which represents that the induction of cardiac hypertrophy. After the injection of curcumin, a slight improvement in reducing the cardiac hypertrophy is observed from the decrease of LVES and LVED values than the EP group. LVES\nand LVED values of CAu Nps and CAu-PLGA Nps coincide well with the values of control group. This relates to the efficient effect of prepared nanoparticles on inhibiting the cardiac hypertrophy. Similarly, systolic function of cardiac such as LVEF and LVFS decreased well for the EP group (Fig. 6C) due to enhancement of cardiac toxicity. But the treatment with CAu-PLGA Nps shows improved systolic function as represented by its LVEF and LVFS values which agrees well with the control group. For supplementary information to support the performance of CAu-PLGA Nps on inhibiting cardiac hypertrophy, hemodynamic analysis also performed and its parameters is represented in Table 1. Rise of LVEDP and fall of LVSP values of EP group than control group illustrates the creation of cardiac toxicity. Curcumin, CAu Nps and CAu-PLGA Nps treated groups demonstrates that the fall of LVEDP and elevation of LVSP than EP group because of their recital against cardiac toxicity. Analogous to this, maximum and minimum of LV pressure parameters also related to the performance of prepared polymeric nanoparticles as approximating control group."

Similarly Fig. 7 (A&B) represents the secretion of cortisol and aldosterone hormones. EP produced a higher hormone secretion but after the treatment with curcumin, CAu Nps and CAu-PLGA Nps successively controlled the hormone level as lipke in control group. Increase of hormone level leads to the failure of heart functions by the failure performance of left ventricle. Hence the prepared polymeric Nps controls the myocyte death thereby prevents the cystolic control from entering into the systemic circulation. CAu-PLGA nanoparticles treated group exhibit greater anti-cardiac activity which can be attributed to the phenomena that enhanced permeability, functional flexibility and retention properties of Au Nps at the targeted affected area [57–59]. Similarly, PLGA polymers induces drug release and transport effectually at the concerned part of cardiac."

CAu-PLGA Nps enables drug delivery in a maximum and controlled manner thereby enhanced therapeutic efficiency. Loading of CAu with PLGA nanoparticles through phenolic bond increases its stability was confirmed by FT-IR studies. Characterization techniques suggested the nanosize range is from 50 to 80 nm of Au nanoparticles and proves the synthesis of CAuPLGA Nps by successful encapsulation protocol. Animal studies data suggests that the CAu-PLGA Nps produced improved survival rate, HW/ BW ratio and CSA at the suitable level, absence of alteration and degeneration of myocardium observed by histological studies, maintained LVES, LVED, LVEF and LVFS levels observed by echocardiographic analysis and preventing increase of enzymes and hormone levels. As ememplified in this report, CAu-PLGA Nps played a critical role in protecting animal model from cardiovascular dysfunction like cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac toxicity and heart failure. This function is accomplished by its anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant properties. Structural modification of curcumin with PLGA increased its bioavailability by circumventing poor absorption and controlling rapid metabolism which proves that CAu-PLGA Nps has been found to be effective and non-toxic cardiac anti-hypertrophy drug with maximum delivery of drug."

This study demonstrated the application of curcumin capped gold loaded poly (lactic-coglycolic acid) nanoparticles (CAu-PLGA Nps) for the inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy by preserving myocardial functions of Wister rat model. Rat models were arbitrarily divided into five groups and observation period was 10 weeks; 1. Control 2. Enalopril (EP), an hypertropic agent induced group 3. EP and Curcumin (C) 4. EP and Curcumin capped gold (CAu) Nps and 5. EP and CAu-PLGA Nps injected group. CAu-PLGA Nps was first synthesized from double emulsion-solvent evaporation method and were characterized by its adoptable techniques such as FT-IR, XRD, SEM and TEM analysis. These analyses demonstrate the encapsulation of curcumin capped gold nanoparticles into PLGA there confirms the successful synthesis of CAu-PLGA Nps. Animals studies illustrates that the CAu-PLGA Nps has significantly produced cardiac anti-hypertrophy and drug delivery when compared to the other groups. CAu-PLGA Nps exhibit increased survival rate, improved cardiac functions like cardiac systolic and diastolic function, maintaining heart weight and left ventricle pressure at the controlled level. Beneficiary activities of CAu-PLGA Nps were associated with its cardiovascular functions like anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, controls cardiomycete growth, increased drug delivery, prevents accumulation of cholesterol and prevents myocardial infarction.",
