      "text" : "Mucosal drug administration has several advantages compared with the more invasive parenteral route. This is particularly the case for local treatment of, for example, infections, pain and dryness, minimizing the systemic side-effects. Also in cases of systemic treatment, several advantages can be identified, such as lower risk, lower cost, usually less pain and less need for qualified healthcare workers to carry out the injections. On the downside, the robust mucosal barrier usually reduces the bioavailability.\nMicro- and nanoparticles in the size range of from around 150 nm up to 6 μm can be used to deliver drugs to the mucosal membranes of various organs.

Increased residence time on the mucosal membrane – mucoadhesion – can also increase the bioavailability of systemically acting drugs, by increasing the time available for drug absorption. This strategy may be even more promising if the formulation is mucopenetrating, thereby bringing the drug in close proximity to the cellular epithelial membrane (Figure 5.1). The particles can even be surface modified to target particular cell types or transporters of the mucosal membrane. Once the absorption site is reached, the particles can be engulfed while still containing the active ingredient, or release the drug to be absorbed separately. If the particles contain excipients affecting the cell membrane, an increased permeability may be achieved. The risk is unwanted toxic effects. Increased absorption is advantageous in the case of systemic treatment, while the opposite is true for local treatment.\nThe core material, size and coating of micro- and nanoparticles will govern their behaviour. With detailed knowledge of this relationship, particles can be designed to match the desired outcome. This chapter will present the most common and promising in vitro and ex vivo methods of testing and estimating the in vivo behaviour of these small formulations, giving examples of different types of particles and systems along the way. A distinction will be made between mucoadhesion and bioadhesion, where mucoadhesion is preferred when the interaction between particles and the surface is directly related to mucus or mucin."

      "heading" : "5.2 Background and Theory",
      "text" : "All mucosal membranes are covered by a mucus layer, to which the large glycoprotein mucin gives structure and determines the viscoelastic properties. Generally, mucins can be divided into two categories: cell-associated mucins that range between 100 and 500 nm in length and are anchored to the membrane by a transmembrane domain, and secreted mucins that are up to several microns long and more loosely attached to the membrane [1]. Mucus governs the permeability of particles into the epithelium via two main mechanisms: size filtering and interaction filtering (Figure 5.2). These mechanisms are mainly regulated by the physicochemical properties of the mucus, such as pore size, viscoelasticity, pH, charge and ionic strength [2].\nCharacterization of Bioadhesion, Mucin-interactions and Mucosal Permeability 173\nThe mucus layer is crucial for protecting the membrane, and functions as a barrier for micro- and nanoparticles. The trapping of particles in the mucus obstructs their diffusion towards the underlying epithelial cell layer. The mucosal membranes also have rinsing or cleansing mechanisms, reducing the residence time of trapped particles. A particle trapped in mucus (i.e., a mucoadhesive particle) will therefore have an extended, yet limited, residence time, which will vary between the different administration sites.\nOne mechanism responsible for mucoadhesion is non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or ionic interactions, although extensive work has also been put into exploiting the covalent disulfide bonds provided by thiolated polymers [4]. A dry particle can attract water from the underlying mucosa, leading to adhesion by capillary forces. However, this mechanism requires that the formulation is initially dry, which is not always the case. Eventually, the formulation will be fully hydrated and these forces diminish. Entanglements are possible, after the diffusion of hydrated polymer chains on the particle surface into the mucin network. A trapped formulation should release the drug to allow drug diffusion towards the epithelial cell membrane. Another strategy is to exploit mucopenetrating particles.\nThe inspiration for mucopenetrating particles can be found in nature, more specifically by looking towards mucopenetrating viruses. These viruses are characterized by a hydrophilic surface, yet overall neutral charge, avoiding blockage by hydrophobic and ionic interactions. The size is ∼100 nm, avoiding steric blockade. Mucopenetration can thus be achieved by careful surface engineering, alternatively by PEGylating [5]. Another strategy is to associate the particles with mucolytic substances, such as N-acetyl-cysteine or trypsin, yielding active mucopenetrating systems [6].\nEpithelial tissues are characterized by abundant cell junctions, such as tight junctions, limiting paracellular transport. Therefore, a particle may not reach further than the epithelial cell membrane, where the drug is subsequently released. Components of the particle can exert an effect on the cell membrane though, increasing the permeability of, among others, the drug. Permeation enhancers like cell-penetrating peptides have been included in\n174 Characterization of Pharmaceutical Nano- and Microsystems\nparticles to exploit this. Cationic substances (like chitosan) and amphiphilic substances also possess this trait, typically weakening tight junctions. This can lead to unintentional toxicity or systemic side-effects if neglected, illustrating the necessity of thorough testing to control the interaction with cell membranes in addition to mucoadhesion and mucopenetration. Additionally, excipients like Poloxamer/Pluronic® possibly inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) [7]. Functionalized nanoparticles targeting a transporter (e.g., PepT1) can overconcentrate a poorly absorbed drug on the membrane surface, increasing the absorption [8].\nEven intact particles can be absorbed into cells of the epithelial layer, intentionally or unintentionally from the formulator’s point of view. Although nanoparticles will usually be too big for para- or transcellular transport, endocytosis has been demonstrated. M-cells are immune cells of the intestinal mucosa and have a unique ability to perform endocytosis of nanoparticles, particularly after a receptor–ligand interaction. On the basolateral side, the M-cells are co-localized with lymphocytes, thereby delivering their cargo mostly to the lymphatic circulation, before entering the blood circulation via the thoracic duct. Although this capacity is limited, first pass hepatic metabolism is greatly reduced."

      "text" : "The oral cavity can be used for both local and systemic drug delivery via the buccal route. The oral mucosa is composed of a layer of water, mucin and other proteins with a thickness of 70–100 μm [10]. Saliva is continuously produced and bathes the oral cavity and is also effective in flushing harmful substances away. The buccal and the sublingual route of administration are effective in overcoming first pass metabolism (successfully used for delivery of nitroglycerin) and also when a fast response is an advantage. Local administration of nano- and microparticles could be an advantage for treating diseases in the oral cavity, such as oral mucositis, xerostomia, periodontitis and cancer, but also for preventing dental caries. One of the big challenges when formulating new drug delivery systems for local drug delivery is the flow of saliva, which could be as high as 1–3 ml/min when stimulated [11]. This leads to short residence time for the administration system in the mouth, and hence also for the drug. This leads to reduced efficacy.\nOne successful formulation for local administration to the oral cavity is based on microspheres and is commercially available under the trade name Arestin®. Arestin® is used for treating periodontitis and is a dry powder of microspheres composed of poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) and the antibiotic minocycline [25]. The powder is placed in the periodontal pocket with a device. The drug is then slowly released in the periodontal pocket. The success of this formulation is mainly based on the mucoadhesive\n176 Characterization of Pharmaceutical Nano- and Microsystems\nproperties of the microspheres but also the limited flow of saliva in the periodontal pocket.\nOral-lynTM is a new oral-based systemic delivery of insulin for uptake through the buccal mucosa. In 2005 it was approved for treatment of Type 2 diabetes in Ecuador, and some years later in several other countries. Recombinant insulin is formulated with the patented technology RapidMist® as aerosolized micelles with a size of 6 μm [26]. The drug is administered with an asthma-like inhaler. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have also been developed for intra-oral delivery of the anti-emetic agent domperidone [27]. The NLCs showed successful delivery of domperidone through the buccal mucosa in an ex-vivo test and were confirmed non-toxic to TR146 buccal cells (Table 5.2)."

      "text" : "Oral drug administration has some drawbacks despite the huge surface area available for absorption, such as a harsh chemical and enzymatic-degrading environment including first-pass hepatic metabolism, a tight cellular barrier, and fast hydration of formulations. The mucus layer of the gastrointestinal tract is thick, 30–400 μm, causing an unstirred water layer, and the mucus turnover time is 24–48 hours. On a positive note, the constant absorption of water generates a drag towards the cellular epithelial layer for other particles as well.\nWhen lopinavir, used for the treatment of HIV infections, was formulated in glyceryl behenate-based solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) of 230 nm, the AUC increased about two-fold in rats compared with a drug solution [40]. The demonstrated reason was targeting and uptake by the lymphatic circulation, reducing first-pass hepatic metabolism. SLNs taken up into the lymphatic circulation also gained direct access to HIV reservoir sites, an additional advantage [40, 41].\nWhen PEGylated neutral PLGA-based nanoparticles of 200 nm displayed RGD molecules (the tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp) at their surface, the particles concentrated in M-cells due to β1 integrin targeting. When the particles were loaded with the model antigen ovalbumin and orally administered to mice, an immunoglobulin G (IgG) response was induced, demonstrating the potential for mucosal immunization [42]."

      "text" : "The airways are composed of a gradually thinning columnar epithelium populated by ciliated cells with a layer of mucus on top that collectively form the mucociliary escalator [43]. The airways subdivide roughly 16–17 times before the alveoli are reached. The mucociliary apparatus serve as a mechanical barrier by trapping particulates in the surface liquid and clearing them off the bronchial tree by ciliary action [44]. The rheological properties of the mucus may show variations from patient to patient, but also day to day, and appear to be an attribute of both healthy and diseased respiratory tract. If mucus becomes too thick, for example in severe bronchitis or cystic fibrosis where the sputum viscosity can be more than 100 000 times that of water, patients experience great difficulty in mucus clearance, resulting in bacterial overgrowth [1].\nCFBE41o- A cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cell line developed by virus transformation. The cell line expresses tight junctions, but does not produce mucus. Native human mucus, obtained from tracheal tubes of patients undergoing elective surgery, was used as a supplement and the uptake of nanoparticles was dramatically reduced in the presence of mucus. The compatibility of CFBE41o- cells with the human mucus was confirmed.

To overcome this, mucus-permeable lipid-core nanocapsules (LNCs) were developed. Ciprofloxacin-loaded LNCs with a mean size of 180 nm showed increased drug permeation by 50% through mucus [45]. Administration of nanoparticles (NPs) with a high antibiotic load capable of penetrating the tight mesh of biofilm/mucus can be an advent to overcome the treatment challenges. Biodegradable and biocompatible polymer PLGA nanoparticles loaded with ciprofloxacin showed promising effects against cystic fibroses Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection [46].\nOptimization of particle characteristics for deposition in the deep regions of the lung after inhalation is the key challenge in delivery to the lungs [43]. Particles in the range of 1–5 μm are ideal for deposition in the alveoli. One successful formulation on the market is the inhalable insulin AFREZZA® from the company MannKind. AFREZZA® is composed of recombinant human insulin mixed with the excipient fumaryl diketopiperazine (FDKP). Insulin powder particles are adsorbed onto uniform-sized (approximately 2 μm) carrier Technosphere particles, which contain mostly crystallized FDKP. Upon inhalation, the Technosphere particles carry the insulin into the alveoli where they dissolve [47]. The Technosphere insulin is a form of short-acting human insulin to be taken by oral inhaler with meals [48].\nPourusina et al. prepared porous inhalable parathyroid hormone (1–34)-loaded microparticles suitable for pulmonary delivery by using leucine and hydroxy propyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) in water to preserve the parathyroid hormone (1–34) stability for spray freeze-drying [49]. siRNA (small interfering RNA) has great potential in the treatment of a variety of lung diseases, and has been formulated for dry powder inhalation by use of TPP-dendrimer nanocarriers [50]."

      "text" : "Particulate drug delivery to the nose can improve local or systemic effects, especially advantageous in relation to mucosal vaccination [51] and as an alternative to parenteral protein and peptide administration [52]. The reason for the latter is mainly accredited to the lower enzymatic activity, avoidance of first-pass hepatic metabolism and less restrictive tight junctions. The mucus gel layer is relatively thin (5–10 μm), but constantly moved due to beating cilia, significantly reducing the residence time to approximately 15–20 minutes [6, 53]. It is important that the formulation is not cilia-toxic nor irritating, posing some restrictions on type of formulations and excipients.\nAnother intriguing anatomical feature of the nasal mucosa is the olfactory epithelium, with neuronal bundles passing into the central nervous system (CNS) [53]. This direct nose-to-brain delivery of drugs was exploited by Gao et al. for delivering vasoactive intestinal peptide across the blood–brain barrier [54]. The brain bioavailability in mice increased when the neuroprotective peptide was incorporated into poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles, 100–120 nm in size, and increased even further when the nanoparticles were modified with the ligand wheatgerm agglutinin. The spatial memory in ethylcholine aziridium-treated rats improved correspondingly.\n182 Characterization of Pharmaceutical Nano- and Microsystems"

      "text" : "Drug delivery to the eye, primarily for local treatment, is a very challenging task due to the anatomical structure of the eye with both hydrophilic and lipophilic features. In addition, the continuous secretion of tear liquid and drainage through the lacrimal tract also lead to rapid dilution and clearance of the drug [55]. This leads to the necessity of administering the formulation several times a day. The mucus layer of the eye is very thin at around 0.02–0.05 μm [22]. When the tear film is included, the thickness is around 6–7 μm [23].\nOne successful formulation that has been on the market for many years for lowering the pressure of the eye is Blocadren depot®. This formulation can be administered only once a day. The success of this formulation is thought to be the polymer gellan gum being able to react with ions in the tear liquid in situ, thereby increasing the viscosity of the formulation and as such the retention time, but also the mucoadhesive properties of the polymer itself [56].\nInulin-based micelles have been investigated for improved delivery of corticosteroids to the posterior eye-segment. The micelles showed improved permeation over corneal epithelial cells due to enhanced permeation activity of the formulation. Also, the micelles showed strong mucoadhesive properties [57].\nNanoemulsions composed of peanut oil, Tween 80 and Cremophor EL and co-surfactants have been loaded with acetazolamide and investigated for use in the treatment of glaucoma. The nanoemulsion was combined with different in situ forming gelling systems in which the gellan/xanthan gum was the most stable formulation with sustained release of the drug. In vivo trials on albino rabbits showed that the new formulation was superior to products present on the market. This was probably due to both the mucoadhesive properties of the formulation and the enhanced permeation due to the surfactants [58]."

      "text" : "The non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium lining the vaginal mucosa is covered by a discontinuous layer of fluid that protects the underlying tissues. Even though it is referred to as mucosal tissue, the vagina does not have secretory glands, and the fluid bathing the vaginal mucosa comprises mainly cervical mucus and a mix of other upper genital tract fluids, vaginal tissue transudates and secretions from vestibular glands [59]. Estrogen stimulates the epithelial cells to secrete glycogen, which is digested by Lactobacillus vaginalis inhabiting the vagina to produce lactic acid and maintain a low pH, thereby preventing infections by other microorganisms. The vaginal fluid typically has a pH around 3.5–4.5 in healthy women of reproductive age [24]. Its composition, volume, pH and rheological properties are affected by age, the stage in the menstrual cycle, and sexual arousal, thus influencing the release pattern and efficacy of a drug delivery system administered into the vagina [60]. Due to the self-cleansing action of the vaginal tract, the residence times of dosage forms and delivery systems will be reduced unless they are specially adapted to increase the residence time. Mucopenetrating PEGylated liposomes of 180 nm containing interferon alpha-2b were designed to provide localized therapy of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaginal infections [61].\nVivaGel® (SPL7013, astodrimer sodium) from Starpharma is an antimicrobial dendrimer formulated into a mucoadhesive gel that has just recently obtained regulatory\nCharacterization of Bioadhesion, Mucin-interactions and Mucosal Permeability 183\napproval in the EU for topical treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and to reduce recurrence. Since April 2019 VivaGel® has been available as OTC in Australia, where it is marketed under the brand-name Fleurstat BVgel by Aspen Pharmacare. VivaGel® is further being launched worldwide by Mundipharma under the brand-name Betadine BVgel. VivaGel® has also demonstrated efficacy against human immunodeficiency virus and herpes simplex virus in vitro and animal models [62], and is expected to proceed into clinical trials for additional indications. The general concept of one type of nanocarrier in a mucoadhesive gel is frequently seen in development of formulations for vaginal delivery.\nPreventing sexual transmission is significant in the fight against HIV, and the use of vaginal or rectal microbicides for topical pre-exposure prophylaxis is being extensively investigated [63]. Polymeric nanoparticles (mean diameter of 170–200 nm) based on poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) or PLGA have been designed to deliver dapivirine, one of the most promising microbicide drug candidates [64]. It was shown that cell-associated levels of dapivirine provided by nanocarriers were significantly higher (up to nearly 30-fold) in different immune cells compared with the free drug. In addition it was correlated with moderately enhanced in vitro activity against HIV infection in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and a co-culture model of DCs and CD4+ T-cells. Another strategy for developing topical anti-HIV microbicides involves combining two or more antiretroviral drugs in one medical product. PLGA nanoparticles were loaded with efavirenz, and the nanoparticles were incorporated into a fast dissolving film together with free tenofavir [65]. A dual system provides flexibility with respect to pharmacokinetics."

In general, the cell model should form an epithelial-like structure or a monolayer with tight junctions, and secrete mucus. Table 5.2 represents examples of different cell-lines that have been used in studies of nano- and microparticles, classified according to which mucosal membranes they are mimicking. Also some commercially available cell-based tissue models (MucilAir™ from Epithelex, and EpiVaginal™ from MatTeck Corp.) are included. The list is not meant to be exhaustive.\nIn addition to cell-monolayers of mono-cultures, co-cultures of two or more cell-lines have been proposed to more closely resemble tissue. Probably the most sophisticated cellular system simulating the gastrointestinal tract so far consists of a triple co-culture model comprising Caco-2, HT29-MTX and Raji B cells (Figure 5.5), for example [67–69]. Caco-2 monolayers are extensively used as a simple model of the intestinal barrier. The contribution of HT29 clones was demonstrated for dextran-PEGylated microparticles, when the internalization of the encapsulated substance increased due to a favorable effect of\nCharacterization of Bioadhesion, Mucin-interactions and Mucosal Permeability 187\nmucoadhesion. Also, enhanced permeability of insulin encapsulated in multilayered polymeric nanoparticles was more accurately predicted when mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells were included, compared with excised intestinal mucosa of rats. The human Burkitt’s lymphoma Raji B line is included in order to model the human follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) expressing M-cells. Including these cells into the co-culture increased the transport of fluorescent PEGylated PLGA-based nanoparticles containing ovalbumin. The transport increased further when the nanoparticles were RGD-labelled, due to interactions between the RGD ligand and the β1 intregrins detected at the apical surface of the M-like cells in the co-culture. This co-localization was further confirmed in vivo in mice after M-cell staining with rhodamine labelled UEA-1 Lectin [42]. The transport of both free and nanoencapsulated insulin increased when the triple co-culture model was used to study the uptake mechanisms and permeability of chitosan/albumin-coated alginate/dextran sulfate nanoparticles for enhanced oral delivery of insulin.\nAnother interesting cell-based model is the dual-chamber model, which has been developed as an in vitro model to study heterosexual transmission of pathogens and the protective effects of microbicides [70]. The model consists of a tight epithelial cell layer of cervical-vaginal cells (e.g., CaSki, HEC-1A, ME-180) grown on a Transwell® insert, and a basal chamber containing sub-epithelial target cells, such as IL-2 stimulated PBMCs which are sub-epithelial target cells for HIV-1 (Figure 5.6). The dual-chamber model is also interesting for studying the protection efficiency of a vaginally applied microbicide formulations against sexually transmitted infections, and may have an unexploited potential as a formulation screening tool."

Mucus has, for example, been scraped off from the small intestinal tissues of freshly slaughtered pigs. Cervico-vaginal mucus has been collected from cow and humans, broncho-alveolar mucus from horse, and tracheal mucus from humans. However, it has been demonstrated that the removal of mucus from its physiological environment can modify its characteristics; it was not possible to obtain a model mucus system with equivalent rheological properties to natural mucus by rehydration of a commercially available dried crude gastric porcine mucin [73].\nThe type of mucus, any reconstitution or purification steps have been found to influence the results, for example, for mucopenetration of particles. Unfortunately, no validated method for these critical steps exists. Therefore, it becomes challenging to produce a model able to fully mimic physiological mucus, and the differences between native and reconstituted mucus can lead to variations in the resulting drug permeability. Nevertheless, mucus is often used in models to increase the biological relevance of a barrier (Figure 5.7). Used for ranking formulations relative to each other within one laboratory, this can provide quite useful insights."

For example, when a Caco-2 monolayer was incubated with multilayered polymeric nanoparticles containing insulin, the TEER values dropped to about 50–60% after 4 hours, as opposed to 20% and 27% when Caco-2/HT29 and excised intestinal rat tissue was used, respectively [77]. An MTT test was also conducted.\nMucoadhesive chitosan nanoparticles were improved for wet conditions by conjugating hydrocaffeic acid, after inspiration from mussels, which adhere to almost any surface. Incubation with Caco-2 cells grown on Transwell®s caused a transient opening of monolayer tight junctions, which was monitored using TEER; the transport of 4 kDa FITC-dextran increased three-fold. TEER values returned to normal after removal of the nanoparticles, and the cell viability of non-confluent Caco-2 cells was stable, as monitored with MTT [78].\nFurther evidence for the influence of chitosan-based nanoparticles on monolayers were provided by fluorescent staining of the ZO-1 protein involved in the regulation of tight junctions [79]. After incubating a Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-culture with the nanoparticles, the ZO-1 protein became segmented and discontinuous, which correlated with higher permeability of the encapsulated FITC insulin across the cell monolayer, as well as across fresh rat ileum mucosal tissue using an Ussing chamber system, and correlated further with blood glucose drops in vivo in rats. The MTT assay revealed no effect on cell viability.\nAlso when trimethyl chitosan encapsulated insulin with a polymeric dissociable coating was incubated with a HT29-MTX monolayer, the TEER values displayed a transient drop correlating with improved insulin transport across the same monolayer. This was reflected in a segmented and discontinuous staining of claudin-4, another protein associated with tight junctions.

This cantilever deflection is converted into an electrical signal to produce the image. Another working mode of AFM is so-called force spectroscopy. In force measurements, the cantilever approaches and retracts the surface in a vertical direction; during this movement, the deflection of the cantilever is measured as a function of distance to the surface. In addition, the tip of the cantilever can be functionalized with molecules of interest in order to measure the interaction with different samples.

The adsorption of material to the sensor surface (piezoelectric quartz crystal with diverse coatings) causes changes in its mass, monitored as changes in resonance frequency of the quartz crystal. In quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), simultaneous measurement of dissipation factor provides information about the structural changes of a layer occurring during the adsorption process. From these changes it is possible to learn about kinetics of the adsorption process, calculate mass/thickness of the adjacent layer and its viscoelastic properties. Consequently, the QCM-D technique is a very useful tool for assessment of nano- and microparticle interactions with biological compounds. A mass sensitivity of around 0.5 ng/cm2 enables accurate quantification of adsorbent.\nMucoadhesion of nano- and microparticles can be evaluated with QCM by using mucinmodified sensors. The QCM sensor with a proper surface chemistry (i.e., gold-coated quartz crystal functionalized with carboxylic acid groups, enabling efficient mucin immobilization) is covered by a layer of mucin (i.e., porcine gastric mucin, bovine submaxillary mucin) until a stable resonance frequency signal is established [84]. Then the mucin-modified sensor is exposed to the particles of interest and changes in frequency/dissipation are recorded. This method has been used to assess the mucoadhesive properties of various polymers (chitosan, polyallylamine hydrochloride, hyaluronic acid), as well as chitosan-coated polycaprolactone nanoparticles loaded with curcumin and other polysaccharide-based nanoparticles for oral drug delivery [85–87]. By additional recording of different overtones of the oscillating system (harmonic frequencies), information from different penetration depths within a deposited film can be collected. A similar overtones response is an indication for penetration of the particles within the mucin film, while different overtones suggest superficial adsorption on the mucin surface [85]. Oh et al. investigated the mucoadhesion and mucus permeability of thiolated chitosan particles as a function of pH (4 and 6.8) [88]. Due to the chitosan particle adsorption onto the surface, the mass of a sensor increased, followed by a decrease in frequency and increase in dissipation. Changes in dissipation without initial spreading of overtones indicate chitosan permeation into mucin films.\n192 Characterization of Pharmaceutical Nano- and Microsystems\nQCM is also an important tool in bioadhesion measurements. It is often used to study the interactions between the particles for drug delivery and model biological membranes composed of lipid bilayers. Paiva et al. studied the interaction of different anaesthetics with liposomal membrane models, showing that the anaesthetics have a fluidizing effect on the model membranes [89]."

When a polymer and mucin is mixed, the viscosity of the combined sample could be either higher, lower, or the same as the sum of the viscosity of the two components alone. Both higher or lower viscosity could indicate attractive forces either due to enhanced entanglements or hydrogen bonding, or simply due to phase separation [90].\nThe easiest approach to determine a polymer’s mucoadhesive properties is to measure the viscoelastic properties of the polymer in solution, the mucin in solution, and a mixture of the two components by steady shear measurements. The mucoadhesive properties can then be estimated by the equation:\nηb = ηt − ηm − ηp\nwhere ηb is the bioadhesion parameter, ηt is the viscosity of the mixture, ηm is the viscosity of mucin, and ηp is the viscosity of the polymer [91].\nAnother approach is to do a frequency sweep in the viscoelastic region, measure G′ and G′′ of each component, and then compare with the measured values of each component of the mixture [4]. Even though very simple, few studies have been conducted using rheology to estimate the mucoadhesive properties of micro- and nanoparticles. In one study the mucoadhesive potential of thiolated particles was estimated by mixing the particles with mucin collected from urinary bladder, and the interactions were measured by investigating how the dynamic viscosity of the samples changed after addition of mucin [4]. In another study, the mucoadhesive potential of nanoparticles of poly-acrylic acid grafted with papain, an enzyme able to cleave linkages of mucin, was studied by investigating the breakdown of mucus [92]. The particles were mixed with pig gastric mucus. If the particles were successfully adhered and entrapped in the mucus layer, the viscosity of the sample decreased due to the breakdown of mucin and hence the mucoadhesive potential was verified.\nRheology could in theory be used to distinguish between mucoadhesion due to entanglements and hydrogen bonding by adding urea. If the interaction is due to hydrogen bonding, the viscosity would decrease when urea is added [93]."

The results showed high scattering intensity at pH 2 and 4 and low scattering intensity at pH 1 and 7 (Figure 5.8). This is due to the different conformation of mucin chains at different pH values, with the mucin chains\nCharacterization of Bioadhesion, Mucin-interactions and Mucosal Permeability 193\nbeing contracted at pH 1, and also the connectivity within the network. The stronger the associations and higher degree of connectivity, the stronger is the scattering intensity. The samples also showed shear thinning behaviour, with the exception of the sample prepared at pH 7.

A possible drawback could be that the concentration of both the particles and the mucin must be high enough to get reliable rheology measurements."

After incubation, the fluorescence was measured both directly on the surfaces and in the supernatants after first gently washing one time and then again after gently washing a second time, to distinguish high initial adhesion from long-lasting adhesion. Alginate-coated liposomes achieved a high specific (genuine) mucin interaction. The positively charged uncoated liposomes achieved the highest initial mucoadhesion.

The M-cells are specialized cells particularly able to perform endocytosis by phagocytosis, but even enterocytes can perform pinocytosis of particles smaller than ∼100 nm. The mechanisms are micropinocytosis, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, caveolae-dependent endocytosis, or clathrin and caveolae-independent endocytosis. Targeting specific lectin receptors expressed on enterocytes and M-cells with, for example, glycoproteins, lectins, mannose, fucose, or galactose, might increase endocytosis. Ligands like folic acid, albumin and RGD peptide might induce caveolin-mediated endocytosis, while ligands like transferrin and mannose might induce clathrin-mediated endocytosis [111].\nSize and zeta potential of nanoparticles will also influence which uptake mechanisms will dominate, in addition to the speed of endocytosis and the subsequent fate of the endocytosed particles (i.e., lysis or exocytosis) [53].\nCellular uptake studies are often performed by incubating the tissue model with fluorescent formulations, followed by imaging using CLSM. Cellular structures like nuclei\n198 Characterization of Pharmaceutical Nano- and Microsystems\nand actin cytoskeleton may be stained using, for example, DAPI or NucBlue® (for live, unfixed cells) or fluorescent antibodies.

Tissue samples were embedded in a cryostat medium and 10 μm cross-sections sliced using a cryostat. Fluorescence from FITC-insulin and RBITC-alginate was co-localized, indicating that insulin remained with the nanostructure [77]. CLSM images were also used to reveal that the cellular uptake of a hydrophobic fluorescent dye, Nile red, was higher in HT29-MTX\nCharacterization of Bioadhesion, Mucin-interactions and Mucosal Permeability 199\nmonolayers than Caco-2 monolayers, when the favourable bioadhesive properties of encapsulation in dextran-pegylated microparticles encapsulation were exploited [112].\nFor quantification of uptake, cells can be trypsinized after various time periods, washed and recovered by centrifugation before subjected to flow cytometry. Cells that received no particle treatment serve as control samples. This technique was used to assess rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cellular uptake of liposomes containing rhodamine-labeled (red) lipids [113] and FITC-labelled insulin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (∼150 nm) in Caco-2 cells [114]. In the latter study, cell viability was also checked before flow cytometry was performed.\nIt was shown that the use of liposomes, and especially chitosan-coated liposomes, increased the cellular uptake of alendronate in Caco-2 cells, which correlated with enhanced oral bioavailability of alendronate in rats [115]. In this study, Caco-2 cells were incubated with free, liposomal and chitosan-coated liposomal alendronate, and the drug uptake was quantified by HPLC analysis of the supernatant after cell washing and lysis. The amount of drug uptake was expressed per amount of protein as determined by Bradford protein assay.\nLichtenstein et al. found that silver and iron oxide nanoparticles of similar size coated with poly(acrylic acid) mostly localized in the cytosol of cells, with only a minor fraction found in vesicles [28]. The cellular uptake was visualized with transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of fixed and cut monolayers. Ion beam microscopy of fixed monolayers was also conducted to provide information on intracellular concentration and distribution down to the single cell level. Silver and iron quantification using atomic absorption spectroscopy after cell lysis revealed comparable cellular uptake in Caco-2 cells, and a slight increase in silver uptake when Raji-B lymphocytes were included.\nIt should be noticed that the endocytic pathways work simultaneously in cells. Therefore, cellular regulatory mechanisms may compensate for deliberate inhibition of certain endocytic pathways by upregulating other endocytic pathways. Inhibition of clathrin and caveolae mediated endocytosis can, for example, lead to increased levels of micropinocytosis. The data interpretation of translocation of particles into cells can therefore be difficult. The biocompatibility of the treatment should always be monitored, for example by TEER, MTT or dehydrogenase activity.\nTable 5.3 gives an overview of selected literature studying the most relevant mechanisms for nano- and microparticle uptake into epithelial cell layers; different inhibitors and pathway markers have been used.

More commonly, however, only the translocation of the encapsulated drug/marker is monitored.\nLichtenstein and coworkers studied the impact of size, shape and coating on the potential for nanoparticles to penetrate cell membranes and epithelial barriers [28]. If the coating\n202 Characterization of Pharmaceutical Nano- and Microsystems\nwas lost after cellular uptake, the translocation may be determined by the core material, as demonstrated for silver and iron oxide nanoparticles of similar size, coating and charge. The internalized amount was comparable, but only iron oxide nanoparticles additionally passed the epithelial cell layer.\nThe transport of FITC salmon calcitonin across excised rat duodenum mucosa without Peyer’s patches was studied and found to increase when the drug was encapsulated in SLNs [106]. The permeation increased even further when the nanoparticles were modified with peptide ligands, either for goblet cell targeting or a cell-penetrating peptide. The in vitro transcellular transport correlated with the increased drug bioavailability in rats.\nLiu and coworkers showed that when trimethyl chitosan particles were coated with a dissociable mucus-inert hydrophilic coating, the transepithelial transport of encapsulated FITC-insulin across a HT29-MTX monolayer increased [60]. The beneficial effect of the coating was confirmed in diabetic rats, where pHPMA-coated NPs generated a hypoglycemic response after oral administration, and increased the relative bioavailability 2.8-fold compared with uncoated TMC-based NPs. The advantageous use of goblet cell-targeting modification was confirmed with nanoparticles of trimethyl chitosan containing micellar insulin, by an increased transport of FITC insulin across a Caco-2/HT29-MTX monolayer, as well as through excised rat ileum mucosal tissue [77]. Removal of mucus by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) treatment increased the permeation of nanoencapsulated micellar insulin, as opposed to plain micellar insulin. Blood glucose levels in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats following oral administration decreased in accordance with the result from the transport experiments.\nAfter demonstrating that PEG chain length (2000 vs. 3000 vs. 5000 Da) and core material (PLA vs. PLGA) hardly affected the cellular uptake and intracellular itinerary of nanoparticles in Caco-2 cells, Song and coworkers evaluated the transcellular transport of the incorporated model drug curcumin [118]. Curcumin has low stability, poor water solubility and bioavailability, and they found that the transport of the payload was highest when the PEG chain length was high (5000 Da) and PLA was used as core material, which was attributed to the higher drug loading capacity and slower drug release. Even so, the favorable effect of increasing the PEG chain length was also demonstrated for PEGylated nanostructured lipid carriers (∼200 nm) for ocular use [119]. A PEG chain length of 2000–10 000 Da was found to be optimal for the transcorneal permeation of encapsulated ciprofloxacin, while the carbon chain length of phospholipids did not affect penetration. Coating the lipid carriers with chitosan also increased the permeation compared with free drug in solution. However, PEGylated carriers were reported to be more capable of reaching the deeper ocular tissues in vivo.\nThe transcellular permeation of nanoparticles, as opposed to only encapsulated drug, was also demonstrated by Garinot et al.

The enhanced transport of PEGylated PLGA-based nanoparticles through an in vitro model of a co-culture of Caco-2 with human FAE (follicle-associated epithelium) as compared with monocultures of Caco-2 cells was demonstrated by measuring the number of transported nanoparticles with flow cytometry of basolateral solutions.

    "abstractText" : "Mucosal drug administration has several advantages compared with the more invasive parenteral route. This is particularly the case for local treatment of, for example, infections, pain and dryness, minimizing the systemic side-effects. Also in cases of systemic treatment, several advantages can be identified, such as lower risk, lower cost, usually less pain and less need for qualified healthcare workers to carry out the injections. On the downside, the robust mucosal barrier usually reduces the bioavailability. Microand nanoparticles in the size range of from around 150 nm up to 6 μm can be used to deliver drugs to the mucosal membranes of various organs. The drug may be protected against chemical and enzymatic degradation inside a particle. The effect of",
