      "text" : "Glucose monitoring is of great importance in many fields, including clinical diagnostics, food analysis, and biotechnology [1–3]. In particular, the blood glucose monitoring for clinical diagnosis and treatment of diabetes has greatly promoted the development of many glucose analytical methods [4,5]. Over the past years, a number of various approaches have been developed to detect glucose such as chromatography, colorimetry, fluorescence and electrochemical methods [6–9]. Among them, the electrochemical methods are one of the most promising techniques because of its high sensitivity, good selectivity and without complex preliminary separation process [10,11]. Conventionally, the glucose oxidase based glucose sensors exhibit high sensitivity and selectivity. However, due to the intrinsic feature of enzymes, the activity of the glucose oxidase can be easily affected by environment factors, including humidity, temperature, pH value, organic reagents and toxic chemicals [12–15]. Therefore, great effort has been paid to the establishment of nonenzymatic glucose sensors with the advantages of low cost and high stability.\nWith the rapid development of nanomaterials and nanofabrication technology in the past decades, various inorganic complexes have been\nemployed as the electrocatalysts for glucose electro-oxidization. Previous researches mainly focused on the use of noble metals such as Au and Pt [16,17] and their metal complexes such as Pt-CuO [18] and AuRu [19] modified electrodes. These noble metals as electrocatalysts for glucose electro-oxidization showed high electrocatalytic activities and good sensitivity. However, there are some critical issues with noble metal based glucose sensors. The unbalanced distribution and the high cost of noble metal resources drastically limit their commercial applications. Apart from this, they faced with the problems that they are susceptible to the contamination of chemisorbed intermediates and adsorbed chloride ions [20]. The aforementioned problems with noble metal based glucose sensors have facilitated the concentration on the utilization of easily available and low cost metal and their metal oxide materials such as Co3O4, NiO, Cu and CuO [21–24] for the construction of nonenzymatic glucose sensors. Among these various metal and metal oxides, Co3O4 is an important transition metal oxide and magnetic ptype semiconductor. Despite the relatively poor electrical conductivity of pure Co3O4, Co3O4-based nanocomposites have acquired extensively research interest due to their chemical stable, low cost and relatively good electrocatalytic properties [25–30]. NiO is kind of common-seen and bargain-priced material. NiO has been considered as an effective\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2019.02.049 Received 30 November 2018; Received in revised form 31 January 2019; Accepted 26 February 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author.

However, NiO-based nonenzymatic sensors show low durability due to gradual dissolution and detachment of the catalyst from substrates [33]. Therefore, many researchers recently focused on the modification of NiO with support materials such as metal oxides and carbon materials to acquire a satisfying catalytic performance [34–36]. Since the mechanism of a nonenzymatic glucose sensor is based on the direct oxidation of glucose by high valence metal ions on the electrode, more exposed electrocatalytic active sites of electrode material should be highly favorable for the enhanced performance of sensors [37]. Therefore, combining NiO with Co3O4 as the electrode material may be an effective approach to tackle their respective adverse impact and thus to enhance the overall catalytic performance for nonenzymatic sensors.\nHerein, in this paper, Co3O4-NiO nano-needles were prepared using a simple two-step method. The morphology and structure of as-prepared nanocomposite were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and amperometry experiment showed that the Co3O4-NiO nanocomposites exhibited higher electro-oxidation toward glucose as compared to Co3O4 nanomaterials (Scheme 1). It demonstrated that the proposed nanocomposites provide a promising matrix for glucose sensor applications."

      "text" : "Fig. 1a and b show the SEM and TEM images of the synthesized Co3O4-NiO (sample P3). It could be found that the nanocomposites exhibit uniform geometric size with high porosity. The average length and diameter of the nano-needles are about 465 and 25 nm, respectively. In HRTEM image (Fig. 1c), lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.287 nm and 0.212 nm are observed, corresponding to the (220) plane of Co3O4 and the (200) face of NiO, respectively. The corresponding elemental mapping images (Fig. 1d–g) and the EDX spectra (Fig. 1h) of as-synthesized samples indicated that these Co3O4NiO nanocomposites are mainly consisted of Co, Ni and O elements. The powder XRD measurements were used to investigate the crystal structure and phase purity of the obtained samples. As shown in Fig. 1i, the Co3O4 nanoparticles display characteristic peaks at 18.1°, 31.3°, 36.9°, 44.8°, 55.8°, 59.4°, 65.3°, and 76.4°, which are corresponding to the (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), (440) and (620) crystal planes. These peaks are corroborated with standard patterns of Co3O4 (JCPDS 42-1467) [38]. The NiO nanoparticles exhibited the characteristic diffraction peaks at 38.2°, 43.3°, 63.4°, 75.4° and 79.3°, which are in good agreement with (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes of NiO in cubic lattice (JCPDS 71-1179) [39,40]. The XRD spectrum of the prepared Co3O4-NiO composites matches the spectrum of Co3O4 nanoparticles and NiO nanoparticles. However, it is difficult to find the typical peaks of NiO in the Co3O4-NiO composites, which might be attributed to the relatively low content and poor crystallinity of NiO. No other impurity phases observed from the XRD analysis ensured the structural purity of the prepared samples.\nXPS was further analyzing the element information of the Co3O4NiO nanocomposite. As shown in Fig. 2a, the XPS survey spectrum of as-synthesized Co3O4-NiO indicates that these Co3O4-NiO nanocomposites are mainly consisted of Co, Ni and O elements. The XPS survey spectrum of Ni 2p exhibits two contributions, 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, located at 855.2 eV and 873.5 eV respectively (Fig. 2b), confirming the\npresence of NiO species in the product [41]. Besides, the two typical binding energy peaks of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 at 794.6 and 780.3 eV with a separation of 14.3 eV, respectively (Fig. 2c), are assigned to (Co2+/Co3+) [42]. The O 1 s peak at 531.3 eV is related to hydroxyl group, and the peak at 529.7 eV is ascribed to lattice oxygen (Fig. 4d)."

      "text" : "To investigate the electrocatalytic activity of as-synthesized Co3O4NiO nanocomposite toward glucose oxidation, Co3O4-NiO nano-needles were dispersed in Nafion/ethanol solution and modified onto GCE. Fig.\nS2 shows the electrochemical behavior of different samples (P1-P4 GCEs) in a 0.4 mM glucose solution. It illustrates that the oxidation and reduction peaks of the sample P3 GCE (the weight ratio of Co3O4 and NiO is 100:9) is higher than those of other modified GCEs under the same conditions. Thus, P3 material is chosen as the target material and the Co3O4-NiO/GCE represent P3 GCE in the following discussion. The electrochemical behaviors of bare GCE, NiO/GCE, Co3O4/GCE and Co3O4-NiO/GCE were analyzed by using CV technique in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte in the potential range of 0.2 to 0.7 V. As shown in Fig. 3A, the bare GCE showed no noticeable catalytic effects toward the glucose electro-oxidation in current alkaline medium. While NiO/GCE and\nCo3O4/GCE have revealed weak redox peaks owing to the presence of metal catalysts. Previous studies have revealed that there are two redox reactions for Co3O4/GCE in NaOH solution [43–45]. One pair of redox peak can be assigned to the reversible reaction between Co3O4 and CoOOH, while the other pair of redox peak can be assigned to the reversible reaction between CoOOH and CoO2. The reactions can be schematically expressed as follows:\n+ + +Co O OH H O 3CoOOH e3 4 – 2 (1)\n+ + +CoOOH OH CoO H O e– 2 2 (2)\n+ +2CoO glucose 2CoOOH gluconolactone2 (3)\nIn addition, previous results also point out that, the redox peak current for reaction (2) is much stronger than redox peak for reaction (1). In certain cases, two reduction reaction can't be separated thoroughly due to the overlapping of reduction peaks, and the peak for reaction from Co3O4/CoOOH can't be clearly observed [28,46]. Therefore, It is acceptable that the peak potential of CoOOH/CoO2 (peak for reaction (2)) is usually applied for subsequent amperometric detection. For the Co3O4/GCE in the figure, our result has exhibited the prompt current Ipa (anode peak) of 21 μA at 0.58 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is ascribed to the peak for reaction from CoOOH/CoO2. For the Co3O4NiO/GCE in the presence of 0.4 mM glucose, a dramatic prompt Ipa prompt currents Ipa is 50 μA at 0.52 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is much higher as compared to the Co3O4/GCE and NiO/GCE, probably owing to the higher catalytic activity of composite nano-needles through the synergetic effects of NiO and Co3O4 [47,48]. This redox peak is an integrated redox couple owing to the integration of redox couple of NiO/ NiOOH and CoOOH/CoO2 because these two redox couples show similar reaction potentials. The electrocatalysis process of glucose is irreversible. And the reactions can be presumably proposed according to the following:\n+ +2CoO glucose 2CoOOH gluconolactone2 (4)\n+ +2NiOOH glucose 2NiO gluconolactone (5)\nFig. 3B shows the CVs of Co3O4-NiO/GCE using different concentration of glucose. The concentration of glucose varies from 0 to 4.8 mM caused the obvious increase of Ipa with increasing glucose concentration. It demonstrates that glucose can be easily oxidized on the surface of cobalt‑nickel oxides over a wide concentration window which guaranteeing its amperometric glucose sensing applications. Moreover, the electrokinetics involved in the proposed electrode was examined by different scan rates. Fig. 4A displays the CVs of Co3O4NiO/GCE in the presence of 0.4 mM glucose at different scan rates ranging from 10 to 100 mV s−1 in 0.1 M NaOH solution. With the increase of the scan rates, the Epa and Epc (cathode peak potential) were slightly shifted to positive and negative values, respectively. Furthermore, Fig. 4B displays that both Ipa and Ipc (cathode peak current) were\nproportional to the square root of the scan rate, with the high correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9989 (Ipa) and 0.9941 (Ipc) respectively, suggesting that this electrocatalytic process is controlled by the diffusion of glucose to the electrolyte/electrode interface, thus depending on the concentration of glucose in solution."

Fig. S3 displays the influence of the applied potential on the current response of Co3O4-NiO modified GCE toward 0.1 mM glucose in a range from 0.40 to 0.60 V. It can be seen that the maximum current response is obtained when the potential is 0.55 V. Thus, the potential of 0.55 V was chosen as the optimum applied potential in the following experiments."

      "text" : "Amperometric analysis was used to study the analytical performance of the proposed glucose sensor due to its high sensitivity, convective mass transport and rapid detection toward the oxidation of glucose. Fig. 5A showed the typical amperometric responses of Co3O4NiO/GCE on the successive step-wise addition of glucose into the stirring NaOH solution. When a certain concentration of glucose was added at a regular time intervals of 50 s into above solution, a rapid current increment can be observed. The corresponding calibration curves of the proposed Co3O4-NiO/GCE sensor are described in Fig. 5B, which displays two linear response from 1 μM to 3.4 mM (correlation coefficient R2 = 0.9916) and 3.4 mM to 12.2 mM (correlation coefficient R2 = 0.9922). The above two linear ranges can be explained by the different diffusion rates of reaction products under the different glucose concentrations. When in low concentration of glucose, the oxidation products can quickly leave away from the surface of electrode. Nevertheless, the high concentrations of glucose obstruct the diffusion of the gluconolactone. As a result, lower oxidation peak current is detected in the high concentration range and relatively higher oxidation current existed in low concentration of glucose. The limit of detection (LOD) of the Co3O4-NiO nanocomposite based sensor was estimated to be 0.81 μM and the sensitivity is calculated to be 62 mA·M−1·cm−2 (S/"

The stability of the glucose sensor was investigated by analysis the current responses periodically. The modified electrodes were stored at room temperature, and the current response measurements were performed with 1 mM glucose at an interval of every 3 days. Fig. 6B displays the investigation results, the current response remains at about 92% of its initial value, demonstrating high stability of the designed glucose sensor. The above results demonstrate that the fabricated sensor system has relatively good reproducibility and longtime stability. Selectivity test is an important parameter for glucose sensors, electroactive species such as ascorbic acid (AA), acetaminophen (AP) and uric acid (UA) commonly coexist in human serum, although the\nconcentration of these electroactive species are much lower than glucose. In this work, the anti-interference ability of the proposed sensor for quantitative detection of glucose was tested using 0.1 mM AA, 0.1 mM AP and 0.1 mM UA (Fig. 7). Firstly, a clear current response could be observed when 0.1 mM glucose was added to electrolyte solution. While the successive injection of AA, AP and UA to the system, the current response exhibited no appreciable changes. When 0.1 mM glucose was added to the system again, an obvious current response appeared, suggesting that the proposed glucose sensor embodies a good anti-interference property."

    "abstractText" : "In this paper, needle-like Co3O4-NiO nanocomposites with excellent electrocatalytic activity were served as electrode matrix for constructing novel electrochemical glucose sensor. The Co3O4-NiO nanocomposites were synthesized via a simple two-step procedure, showing a uniform geometric size with average length and diameter about 465 and 25 nm, respectively. The Co3O4-NiO composites exhibited random distributed nano-needles were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy. In addition, the needle-like Co3O4-NiO nanocomposites were used as an electrode material for constructing nonenzymatic electrochemical glucose sensor and their electrocatalytic performances were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and amperometry techniques. The sensor exhibited a wide linear response in the 1 μM to 3.4 mM and 3.4 mM to 12.2 mM glucose concentration ranges, a low detection limit of 0.81 μM and a high sensitivity of 62 mA M−1 cm−2 (S/N = 3). Furthermore, the prepared sensor was utilized to detect the glucose levels in human serum, and satisfactory results were obtained. It demonstrated that needlelike Co3O4-NiO nanocomposites are promising materials in practical electrochemical sensing.",
