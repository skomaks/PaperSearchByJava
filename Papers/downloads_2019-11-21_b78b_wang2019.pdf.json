MoO3 precursor is firstly reduced to MoO3−x nanoparticles mediated by N2 molecules excited by electrons emission from hot tungsten filaments. Graphene nanoflakes are then grown on the MoO3−x nanoparticles in a high-flow-rate CH4 environment through the surface conversion of hydrocarbon radicals to benzene. The results indicate that the MoO3−x nanoparticles are mainly composed of Mo4O11 and MoO2 phases and they are covered by the graphene nanoflakes formed via surface growth. This new hybrid structure emits the ultraviolet, blue, green, red and infrared light and the photoluminescence of MoO3−x nanoparticles is quenched by the graphene nanoflakes. The generation of prevailing photoluminescence bands is interpreted by the three mechanisms including the near band edge emission, the transition between two bands and the inter-valence charge transfer transition, which indicates that the intermediate band formed within the bandgap by electrons from oxygen vacancies may cause the emission. The observed photoluminescence quenching of MoO3−x nanoparticles originates from the transfer of electrons from MoO3−x nanoparticles to graphene nanoflakes under electric field formed in the MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake interface. These results not only provide further insights into the rich surface properties of graphene/molybdenum oxide hybrid structures but also contribute to the design and synthesis of new materials and the development of next-generation graphene-based optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "As new advanced functional nanomaterials, hybrids of graphene and molybdenum oxides (MoO3 and MoO2) have attracted much recent attention due to possible rich synergistic effects and a promising range of applications. To date, substantial efforts have been made to study the electrochemical properties of graphene/molybdenum oxide hybrid structures for their potential applications in energy storage devices and other fields [1–9]. MoO3 is a superior semiconducting material with a bandgap of ~3.2 eV, which makes them promising for diverse applications in photocatalysis and optoelectronic devices [10–12]. However, there are no studies to focus on the photoluminescence (PL) properties of graphene/molybdenum oxide hybrid structures, which limit their\napplications in the area of optoelectronics. In this work, we aim to fabricate advanced hybrid structures of molybdenum oxides and graphene and study their optical properties.\nGraphene/MoO3 and graphene/MoO2 hybrid nanomaterials have been successfully synthesized by hydrothermal, electrochemical deposition and other wet chemical methods [1,5–9]. However, MoO3 and MoO2 are stoichiometric molybdenum oxides. Thus the PL properties of the hybrid graphene/molybdenum oxide structures are difficult to tune due to the complexity of modifying the electronic structure of graphene [13]. Molybdenum oxides are broadly represented by crystalline compounds including stoichiometric MoO3 and MoO2 as well as and substoichiometric MoO3−x (2 < x < 3) [10]. This causes us to question if MoO3-x nanomaterials could be used for better tunability of PL emission\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.02.183 Received 6 September 2018; Received in revised form 23 November 2018; Accepted 19 February 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author at: School of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, PR China.

All rights reserved.\nT\nin the hybrid structures with graphene-based materials? MoO3-x, including Mo18O52, Mo17O47, Mo9O26, Mo4O11, etc. [14], is the product of reduction of MoO3, and it has a high carrier concentration due to the generation of oxygen vacancies. These materials also exhibit some fascinating physical properties such as high specific capacity and surface plasmon resonance at near-infrared region [15,16]. Specifically, recent studies indicate that the bandgap of MoO3−x can be tuned by varying the mixture of Mo6+, Mo5+ and Mo4+ ionic states in molybdenum oxides [17,18]. This indicates that the PL properties of MoO3−x nanomaterials can be tuned by controlling the growth conditions.\nGraphene is a layer-structured sp2 carbon material and exhibits excellent properties, promising for a broad range of applications in the areas of sensors, micro-supercapacitors, nanomedicine, and other areas [19–21]. However, zero bandgap of graphene limits its applications in optoelectronics. Compared to graphene, graphene nanoflakes have a narrow bandgap (< 0.2 eV) [22] and more edges and surfaces. As a result, they can be easily decorated by suitable functional groups, which is favourable for diverse applications based on PL properties [23].\nConsidering potentially complementary PL properties of MoO3−x nanomaterials and graphene nanoflakes, we design the MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake hybrid structure shown in Fig. 1(a). Due to the higher work function of MoO3−x (~ 6.0 eV) than that of graphene nanoflakes (~4.0 eV) [24,25], the electrons move from the nanoflakes to the supporting MoO3-x nanoparticles. According to the band diagram of the hybrid structure presented in Fig. 1(b), when the hybrid structure is irradiated by ultraviolet light, the electron-hole pairs are generated in MoO3−x. Similar to ZnO/graphene hybrid structures [26], photo-generated electrons can be transferred from the conduction band of MoO3-x to the graphene nanoflake. This electron transfer may modify (e.g., quench) the PL of MoO3-x nanoparticles. As such, the MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake hybrid structures can be regarded as alternative new materials of next-generation optoelectronic nanodevices, potentially surpassing the ZnO/graphene hybrid structures [27].\nIn this paper, an unconventional method was used to fabricate the MoO3-x/graphene nanoflake hybrid structures via surface growth, i.e., MoO3−x nanoparticles were prepared in hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) system using low-cost MoO3 powder and N2, followed by the surface growth of graphene nanoflakes on the MoO3−x nanoparticles via the surface conversion of hydrocarbon radicals formed by CH4 in HFCVD system. This method is based on the effective reduction of MoO3 by excited N2 molecules. Depending on the emission of electrons from tungsten filaments at high temperature, N2 molecules are excited through electron-impact collisions [28] and then react with MoO3 [29], which leads to the reduction of MoO3. Moreover, only lowcost, non-toxic N2 and CH4 gases were used in the process of fabricating the MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake hybrid structures; as such this method can be regarded as a promising environment-benign synthesis route compared to wet chemistry and other common approaches. Furthermore, the PL properties of MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake hybrid\nstructures are studied at room temperature, and the mechanisms of PL emission in the hybrid structures are analyzed."

      "text" : "The synthesis of MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake hybrid structure was carried out in HFCVD system described in details elsewhere [30]. Briefly, the heating system is made of the three coiled tungsten filaments in the CVD chamber, which are used to heat the substrate, evaporate MoO3 and decompose reactive gas. The temperature of the filaments can be adjusted through the change of AC current. The substrate temperature is monitored by a thermal couple and can be adjusted through changing AC current and distance between filaments and substrate.\nDuring experiments, MoO3−x nanomaterials were firstly grown on Si substrate deposited with ~20 nm gold thin film in the N2 environment and then graphene nanoflakes were grown on MoO3−x samples in the CH4 environment. When MoO3−x nanomaterials were synthesized, a 3mm thick heat-resistant board below the filaments about 10mm was used to hold Si substrate and MoO3 powder. Like a synthesis of MoSe2 in Ref. [30], MoO3 powder was placed around the Si substrate. After the CVD chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 2 Pa, N2 was inlet into the chamber at a flow rate of 50 sccm. Once the pressure in the chamber was stabilized at ~2×103 Pa, the filaments were heated. Due to the short distance between the filaments and substrate, the substrate was heated quickly to ~700 °C. At this temperature, the MoO3−x nanomaterials were grown for 5 and 7min, respectively.\nSimilarly, the graphene nanoflakes were grown in the CH4 environment. In the synthesis process of graphene nanoflakes, the MoO3−x sample was placed on a molybdenum holder about 8mm below the filaments. The flow rate of CH4 was 70 sccm, and the pressure in the chamber was retained at ~2×103 Pa. Under this pressure, the graphene nanoflakes were grown at ~950 °C for 7 and 9min, respectively. The typical and efficient growth conditions are presented in Table 1.\nThe surface structure and composition analyses of MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake nanomaterials were carried out in S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), FEI Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope (TEM), TTRAX3 X-ray diffractometer (XRD), HR 800 micro-Raman spectroscopy using 532 nm line of semiconductor laser, and ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) using Al Kα X-ray source, respectively. Furthermore, the PL properties were studied at room temperature in Horiba Scientific Labram HR evolution Raman spectrometer under the excitation of 325 nm line of He-Cd laser, which the power of the laser was set to 6.8 mW."

      "text" : "The surface and section morphologies of samples A–D are presented in Fig. 2. Both the surface and section FESEM images indicate that the samples A and B are composed of nanoparticles and the samples C and D are composed of nanoparticles and nanoflakes. Furthermore, Fig. 2(c) and (d) present that the nanoparticles are covered by the nanoflakes.\nThe surface composition of samples A–D is observed from Raman spectra outlined in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the peaks at about 127, 983 and 985 cm−1 are attributed to the Raman scattering of Mo4O11 [31,32], and the peaks at ~210, 423 and 489 cm−1 result from the Raman scattering of MoO2 [33,34], respectively. These Raman peaks indicate that the samples A and B are composed of Mo4O11 and MoO2. The peaks at 240 and 853 cm−1 are related to the Raman scattering of MoO3 [33,35], which address that there is the residual MoO3 in the samples A and B. For the peak at about 872 cm−1, it is attributed to the\nvibration of Mo-O-Mo bond on surfaces of polymerized molybdenum oxide species [36]. As for two peaks at ~395 and 829 cm−1, their origin is not clear, which may be related to the deformation of MoeO bonds [10]. Fig. 3(a) demonstrates that MoO3 is indeed reduced into MoO3−x (i.e., Mo4O11, x=0.15) by N2 and MoO3-x is further reduced into MoO2.\nThe Raman spectra of samples C and D in Fig. 3(b) reveal the peaks related to carbon. The peaks at about 1344, 1581 and 2691 cm−1 feature the D, G and 2D Raman peaks of graphene nanoflakes [37,38], which evidence the formation of graphene in the samples C and D. The appearance of peak at about 127 cm−1 related Mo4O11 indicates the growth of graphene nanoflakes on the MoO3-x nanoparticles (NPs), i.e., the MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake hybrid structure is formed.\nIn addition to Raman analysis, the surface composition of samples A-D is analyzed by the XRD patterns in Fig. 4. The XRD patterns in Fig. 4(a) indicates that the samples A and B are composed of MoO2 and Mo4O11 phases, which are evidenced by the diffraction peaks of MoO2 at ~26.0°, 37°, 53.1° and 53.6° (JCPDS: 32-0671) and the diffraction peaks of Mo4O11 at about 32.9°, 38.2° and 40.4° (JCPDS: 13-0142), respectively. In Fig. 4(a), the weak peaks at about 56.3° and 58.7° are attributed to the diffraction of MoO3 (JCPDS: 21-0569) and Mo (JCPDS: 42-1120), respectively. These two weak peaks demonstrate that the samples A and B are mixed with a small quantity of residual MoO3 and reduced Mo.\nThe XRD patterns in Fig. 4(b) indicate that the samples C and D contain MoO3-x phases and MoeC alloy phases. The MoO3-x phases are confirmed by the XRD peaks of Mo17O47 at the peaks at about 28.3°–30.3° (JCPDS: 13-0345) and the XRD peaks of Mo4O11 at ~ 32.9°,\n38.2° and 41.9° (JCPDS: 13-0142), respectively. The MoeC alloy phases are evidenced by the XRD peaks of Mo2C at ~ 34.4°, 39.5° and 43.6° (JCPDS: 45-1013) and the XRD peaks of (Mo, C) and (Mo, C, O) alloys at about 37.8° and 52.2° (JCPDS: 20-0748 and 21-0565), respectively. In Fig. 4(b), the weak peak at ~43.0° is related to the diffraction of MoO3 (JCPDS: 21-0569), which indicates that there is a few of residual MoO3 in the samples C and D.\nCompared with the Raman spectra, the XRD patterns in Fig. 4(b) do not show the peaks related to pure carbon, which results from the think graphene nanoflakes in the samples.\nThe surface microstructures and composition of MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake hybrid structures are further analyzed using the surface microanalysis instruments including high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and XPS, which evidence the reduction of MoO3 and the formation of MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake hybrid structures via surface growth. The HRTEM images in Fig. 5(b) and (c) indicate that sample B is crystalline structure. As shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c), we measured the widths of 5 layer crystal planes using Digital Micrograph software and obtain the lattice spaces of ~0.24 and 0.34 nm, which approach to the lattice space of MoO3 (0.23 nm) and MoO2 (0.34 nm) [39,40], respectively. These data indicate that MoO3 is reduced and the sample B is composed of MoO3−x NPs.\nThe HRTEM images in Fig. 6 demonstrate the crystalline structure of graphene nanoflakes and the wrapping of graphene nanoflakes on\nMoO3−x NPs. Fig. 6(a) features the surface growth of graphene nanoflakes. The interfaces between graphene nanoflakes and MoO3−x NPs in Fig. 6(b) and (c) indicate the formation of MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake hybrid structure.\nLike Fig. 5, we measured the widths of 5 layer crystal planes using Digital Micrograph software. According to the width values in Fig. 6(b) and (c), the lattice spaces are ~0.25, 0.36 and 0.23 nm, respectively. These lattice spaces approach to the lattice space (0.27 nm) of Mo4O11 (020) and the lattice space (0.23 nm) of Mo2C (401) [JCPDS: 13-0142, 45-1013], respectively. The lattice space of 0.35 nm approaches the interlayer space (0.34 nm) of carbon onions obtained by Lian et al. [41]. These lattice spaces fully evidence that the graphene nanoflakes are grown on the MoO3−x NPs, i.e., the MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake hybrid structure is formed.\nThe binding states of elements from the XPS spectra of samples A and C are addressed in Figs. 7 and 8. The XPS spectrum of sample A in Fig. 7 presents the Mo 3d, O 1 s and C 1 s peaks at ~234.5, 531.4 and 285.0 eV, respectively. Here the appearance of C 1 s XPS peak results from the contamination of the XPS system [42]. For the XPS spectrum of sample C in Fig. 7, it exhibits the C 1 s and O 1 s XPS peaks at ~ 285.0 and 533.0 eV, respectively.\nThe high-resolution Mo 3d, C1s and O1s peaks are shown in Fig. 8. After Shirley background subtraction, the XPS peaks are fitted using the standard XPS analyzing software and they are presented in Fig. 8. The Mo 3d XPS spectrum in Fig. 8(a) presents a series of peaks related to\nMo. Among these peaks, the weak peak at ~228.4 eV is related to Mo 3d5/2 [33], the peaks at ~229.6 eV is attributed to Mo4+ 3d5/2 [8], the peaks at ~231.7 and 234.9 eV originate from Mo5+ 3d5/2 and Mo5+ 3d3/2 [43], and the peaks at ~232.9 and 236.1 eV result from the Mo6+ 3d5/2 and Mo6+ 3d3/2 [31,43], respectively. The two peaks in Fig. 8(b) locate at ~530.8 and 532.1 eV, which are attributed to MoeO and CeO bonds [7,33], respectively. The formation of CeO groups in sample A may result from small sample contamination. For the C 1 s and O1 XPS spectra of sample C in Fig. 8(c) and (d), the peaks at ~284.7 and 285.3 eV are attributed to sp2 and sp3 carbon, and the peaks at 531.8 and 533.1 eV results from CeO and CeOH groups [44–46], respectively. The appearance of CeO and CeOH groups in sample C may be related to the weak absorption of O2 and water molecules in the air."

Simultaneously, the gold film on the Si substrate is molten to form Au NPs [47], which promote the absorption of MoO3 molecules on the substrate. In other words, some MoO3 molecules are absorbed on the surfaces of Au NPs in the process of heating the substrate. When the filaments are heated to a specific temperature, electrons emit from the hot filaments and locate near the filaments. As a result, these electrons collide with the N2 molecules near the filaments to excite them [28],\n+ → + ∗e N N e2 2 (1)\nSince the excited N2 molecules are highly active, they easily react with other molecules [29]. Thus, there are following possible reactions\nto occur in a gas environment,\n+ → + ∗8MoO N 2Mo O 2NO3 2 4 11 (2)\nHowever Mo4O11 is metastable, it is further reduced to MoO2 [48],\n+ → + ∗2Mo O 3 N 8MoO 6NO4 11 2 2 (3)\nFurthermore, some MoO2 molecules is reduced by NO into Mo,\n+ → +MoO 2NO Mo 2NO2 2 (4)\nAfter the Mo4O11 and MoO2 molecules deposit on the substrate, a reaction occurs on the surfaces of Au NPs [48],\n+ →MoO 3MoO Mo O2 3 4 11 (5)\nThe reactions (4) and (5) indicate that MoO2 is exhausted to form Mo and Mo4O11. However, some MoO3 molecules result in the formation of a small quantity of Mo. Of course, it is impossible for MoO3 to be reduced completely, i.e., there is residual MoO3. Thus the samples A and B are composed of Mo4O11 and MoO2, but they are mixed with a small quantity of MoO3 and Mo, which are confirmed by the XRD and\nXPS results."

      "text" : "During the growth of graphene nanoflakes, CH4 is introduced into the chamber before heating the filaments, i.e., some CH4 molecules are absorbed on MoO3−x NPs when the substrate is heated. Due to high substrate temperature (~950 °C), the following surface reactions probably occur on the MoO3−x NPs, which are similar to the reduction of chromium oxide by methane [49]. The proposed surface reactions are,\n→ +CH C H4 2 (6)\n+ → +2Mo O 22H 8Mo 22H O4 11 2 2 (7)\n+ →2Mo C Mo C2 (8)\nThe formation of Mo2C is evidenced by the XRD and TEM results. Simultaneously, the high temperature of filaments (~2000 °C) re-\nsults in decomposition of CH4, which forms hydrocarbon radicals and atomic hydrogen. For example,\n→ +CH CH H4 3 (9)\nUnder the temperature gradient between filaments and substrate, the hydrocarbon radicals and H atoms diffuse towards the substrate. When the density of hydrocarbon radicals around the surfaces of MoO3−x NPs is high enough, they highly-likely form benzene molecules through surface conversion mechanism of hydrocarbon radicals to benzene [50],\n→ →CH C H C Hx y2 6 6 (10)\nThe benzene molecules then further form graphene nanosheets through a polymerization reaction on the surfaces of MoO3−x NPs. The\ndifference in the thermal expansion coefficient between the graphene and MoO3−x nanoparticle results in stress in the graphene nanosheets, which causes the fracture of graphene nanosheets [44]. Under stress, the cracks of graphene nanosheets bend upward to form the oriented graphene nanoflakes via surface growth [51], which are addressed by Fig. 2.\nFrom Table 1, the flow rate of CH4 is 70 sccm, which means that some hydrocarbon radicals quickly reach the surfaces of MoO3−x NPs. Therefore, the graphene nanoflakes form very fast on the surfaces of MoO3-x NPs to hinder the absorption of hydrocarbon radicals on the surfaces of MoO3−x NPs. As a result, the reactions (6)–(8) end quickly and the carbon atoms form the amorphous carbon layers on the surfaces of MoO3-x NPs, which are confirmed by Fig. 6(b) and (c).\nThe above surface analyses indicate that the formation of graphene nanoflakes results from the surface conversion mechanism of hydrocarbon radicals to benzene. In the process of conversion, there are some carbon atoms to form on the carbon nanoflake surfaces. The incorporation of these carbon atoms in the surface layers of graphene nanoflakes leads to the disorder in the graphene nanoflakes. Thus, Fig. 6(a) exhibits the amorphous structure in the graphene nanoflakes."

      "text" : "Fig. 4(b) shows weak peaks of MoO3−x compared to MoeC alloys, which is related to instability of MoO3−x phases. Because the MoO3−x phases are the intermediate products in the reduction process of MoO3 [48], they are further reduced to Mo and then react with C to form the MoeC alloys during the growth of graphene nanofalkes. Thus the MoO3−x phases are reduced in the hybrid nanomaterials. Whether can the MoO3-x phases be improved? We prepared the samples using different conditions and the results are shown in supporting information (SI). Compared with Fig. 4(a), Fig. S2(a) in SI does not show the XRD peaks of MoO2, which means that the MoO3−x phases are improved under the low N2 flow rate conditions. In other words, the MoO3−x phases can be controlled by varying the flow rate of N2. To avoid any further reduction of MoO3−x, the graphene nanoflakes are firstly grown on the Au/Si substrates, and then the MoO3−x flakes are grown on the graphene under low flow rates of N2. As we expected, Fig.S3 and S(4) in SI indicate that the MoO3−x phases can be made more abundant through the growth of MoO3−x films on the graphene nanoflakes under conditions of low flow rates of N2."

Moreover, the intensity of PL bands of samples C and D is lower than the intensity of PL bands of samples A and B, which indicates that the photoluminescence of MoO3-x NPs is quenched by graphene nanoflakes."

      "heading" : "3.3.1. Generation of PL bands",
      "text" : "The emission of different PL bands from samples A and B is related\nto the electronic structure of MoO3−x. Dieterle et al. [52] studied its electronic structure and they proposed that the valence band is formed by O 2p-π orbitals and the conduction band is generated by overlapping of Mo 4d and 5 s bands. However, the d band of the Mo5+ defect with oxygen vacancy (Mo5+ is evidenced by Fig. 8) is split by the crystal field into a non-degenerated dz2 and a triply degenerated (dxy, dxz, and dyz) sub-bands.\nAccording to the band structure of MoO3−x, the UV PL band (387 nm) is related to the bandgap, which can be attributed to near band edge emission due to free exciton recombination [18,52]. The\nenergy difference between the two sub-bands is 2.48 eV [50]. Thus, the transition between Mo5+ dxz and dyz sub-bands can emit the green PL band (504 nm), and Inzani et al. accept that the green PL band originates from the transition between Mo5+ dxz and dyz sub-bands [18]. From the band structure of MoO3-x [52], it is difficult for the electrons on the valence band to be excited to the dxz band using the 325 nm line of He-Cd laser. What electrons are excited to emit the green PL band? The studies of Vasilopoulou et al. [24] indicate that the electrons from the oxygen vacancies are partially transferred to MoeMo (with d-d character) bands and further form an immediate band within the bandgap. In other words, the electrons in the immediate band are easily excited to the dxz band by the 325 nm line of He-Cd laser. Thus the green PL emission can be attributed to the transition between Mo5+ dxz and dyz sub-bands. Also, the optical bandgap of MoO2 films changes from 2.38 to 2.53 eV depending on their thickness [53], the green PL emission is related to the transition between the conductor and valence bands of MoO2. The red PL (632 nm) emission is associated with the intervalence charge transfer transition. The results of Dieterle et al. [52] indicate that the intervalence charge transfer transition of Mo5+–O–Mo6+→Mo6+–O–Mo5+ results in an absorption band at ~2.0 eV, thus the generation of red PL band is attributed to the intervalence charge transfer transition of defect centers. For the IR PL (747 nm) emission, it is related to the transition between the immediate and valence bands [14]. From the analyses, the immediate band within the bandgap plays important roles in the process of PL emission.\nWhen the samples C and D are irradiated by the laser, both the\nMoO3−x NPs and graphene nanoflakes generate PL emission. The generation of PL bands from the MoO3−x NPs is interpreted in the above segment. For the generation of PL bands from graphene nanoflakes, it was studied in the early works [44,45]. The UV and blue PL bands at ~380 and 448 nm are generated from the hydrocarbon radials terminated on the edges of graphene nanoflakes. The green and red PL bands at ~516 and 630 nm are attributed to the transition of electrons between π* and π bands of different sp2 carbon clusters of graphene nanoflakes. The IR PL band at ~755 nm is related to the transition between π* band and O defect level in the sp2 carbon clusters. The detail discussion can refer to Refs. [44] and [45]."

      "text" : "Since the MoO3−x NPs and graphene nanoflakes simultaneously generate PL emission under irradiation of light, the PL intensity of samples C and D should be stronger than the PL intensity of the samples A and B, while Fig. 8 exhibits that the PL intensity of the samples C and D is lowered. This means that the photoluminescence of MoO3−x NPs is quenched by graphene nanoflakes, which relates to the electronic structure of MoO3−x NP/graphene nanoflake interfaces presented in Fig. 1(b). Due to the higher work function of MoO3−x than graphene nanoflake [24,25], electrons transfer from graphene nanoflakes to MoO3−x NPs [54]. As a result, an electric field is formed in the MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake interface. When the samples C and D are irradiated by the laser, most of the light is absorbed by the MoO3−x NPs due to low absorption of graphene for light [55]. As a consequence, the electrons on the valence band of MoO3−x NPs and the immediate band are excited to the conduction band, which are shown in Fig. 1(b). Under the electric field formed in the interface, the excited electrons can partially penetrate the MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake interface layer to come in the conduction band of graphene nanoflakes, and then they transit to the valence band of graphene nanoflake to recombine with the holes on the valence band of the MoO3−x nanoparticle. For the electrons which do not penetrate the MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake interface layer, they are used to generate the weak PL emission through the transition. It is the reason that the photoluminescence of the MoO3−x NPs is quenched by the graphene nanoflakes."

      "text" : "From Fig. 9, the PL intensity of samples is weak, which is related to\nshort acquisition time in a wave band during PL measurement. In SI, Fig. S5 shows the PL spectra of samples obtained in different acquisition time and the results indicate that the PL intensity is improved with the acquisition time. Compared with other PL materials such as ZnO, the PL intensity of MoO3−x nanomaterials is indeed weak. Specific mechanisms for the improvement of the PL properties of MoO3−x nanomaterials require further studies."

      "text" : "According to the above analyses on the PL properties, the PL quenching of MoO3−x NPs results from the transfer of electrons from MoO3−x NPs to graphene nanoflakes. In other words, the MoO3−x/ graphene nanoflake hybrid structures can provide electrons under irradiation of light. Thus it can contribute to the development of nextgeneration graphene-based solar cells. Moreover, the PL quenching features the increase of carrier density, which can tune the properties of surface plasmonic resonance of MoO3-x nanomaterials [10]. Thus, the MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake hybrid structures can be used as the materials tuning the plasmonic devices. According to the above mechanism of PL quenching, the PL quenching of MoO3−x NPs implies that the density of holes is increased, i.e., the catalytic activity is improved [56]. Thus, the MoO3−x NP/graphene nanoflake hybrid structures can be used as the advanced photocatalysts."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusion",
      "text" : "An unconventional method was used to fabricate the MoO3−x/ graphene nanoflake hybrid structures in HFCVD system. The surface structure and composition of hybrid structures were characterized using a series of advanced instruments including SEM, high-resolution TEM, XRD, XPS and Raman spectroscope. The formation of MoO3−x NPs results from the reduction of MoO3 by excited N2 molecules due to the collision of electrons emitted from hot tungsten filaments. The growth of graphene nanoflakes on the MoO3−x NPs is related to the surface conversion of hydrocarbon radicals to benzene at a high flow rate of CH4. The PL properties of MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake hybrid nanomaterials were studied at room temperature, which indicates that they generate the UV, blue, green, red and IR PL bands and the photoluminescence of MoO3−x NPs is quenched by the graphene nanoflakes. The generation of different PL bands of MoO3−x NPs is attributed to the near band edge emission, the transition between Mo5+ dxz and dyz subbands, the intervalence electron transfer transition and the recombination of electrons on the immediate band with the holes on the valence band. The PL bands of graphene nanoflakes are related to the hydrocarbon radicals terminated on the edges of graphene nanoflakes and the sp2 carbon clusters in the graphene nanoflakes. The PL quenching of MoO3−x NPs originates from the transfer of electrons from MoO3−x NPs to graphene nanoflakes under the electric field formed in the MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake interfaces. These results not only provide further insights into the rich properties of graphene/molybdenum oxide hybrid structures but also contribute to the design and synthesis of new materials and the development of next-generation graphene-based optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices."

    "abstractText" : "An unconventional method based on hot filament chemical vapor deposition system is used to fabricate MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake hybrid structures via surface growth. MoO3 precursor is firstly reduced to MoO3−x nanoparticles mediated by N2 molecules excited by electrons emission from hot tungsten filaments. Graphene nanoflakes are then grown on the MoO3−x nanoparticles in a high-flow-rate CH4 environment through the surface conversion of hydrocarbon radicals to benzene. The results indicate that the MoO3−x nanoparticles are mainly composed of Mo4O11 and MoO2 phases and they are covered by the graphene nanoflakes formed via surface growth. This new hybrid structure emits the ultraviolet, blue, green, red and infrared light and the photoluminescence of MoO3−x nanoparticles is quenched by the graphene nanoflakes. The generation of prevailing photoluminescence bands is interpreted by the three mechanisms including the near band edge emission, the transition between two bands and the inter-valence charge transfer transition, which indicates that the intermediate band formed within the bandgap by electrons from oxygen vacancies may cause the emission. The observed photoluminescence quenching of MoO3−x nanoparticles originates from the transfer of electrons from MoO3−x nanoparticles to graphene nanoflakes under electric field formed in the MoO3−x/graphene nanoflake interface. These results not only provide further insights into the rich surface properties of graphene/molybdenum oxide hybrid structures but also contribute to the design and synthesis of new materials and the development of next-generation graphene-based optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.",
