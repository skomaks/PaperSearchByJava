      "text" : "The rapid development of mobile and portable electronics, from smartphones to electric vehicles, demands smaller and lighter energy-storage devices with yet higher energy densities and power outputs. Generally, these devices comprise two electrodes (cathode and anode) that are separated electronically by a separator and an ionically conducting electrolyte. Because the electrochemical reactions occur at the electrode/electrolyte interface, tunability of both ion and electron conductivity is critical [1]. In addition, materials for next-generation energy-storage devices must also satisfy other key design criteria, including fast charge-carrier transport, large specific surface area, high chemical stability, and excellent tolerance to volumetric expansion/contraction [2]. Over the past two decades, advances in nanotechnology have significantly improved the specific capacity, rate capability, and long-term stability of energy-storage devices [3]. For example, reducing the feature size of active materials and combining them with functional frameworks has dramatically improved overall ionic and electronic conductivity due to shortened diffusion lengths and increased reaction surface area [4,5]. Nevertheless, current composite electrodes still struggle with relatively weak mechanical binding, nanoparticle agglomeration, poor component contact, and fracture/delamination during cycling due to large volume change [6]. As research has expanded in this area, scientists have looked beyond traditional nanomaterials (e.g., carbon- or silicon-based nanomaterials, metallic nanostructures) to improve the performance of these devices.\nHydrogels are an emerging material platform for electrochemical devices that have attracted significant fundamental and applied interest. Hydrogels are 3D networks of crosslinked polymer chains that readily imbibe water and swell without dissolving [7,8]. Due to their highly tunable mechanical, thermodynamic, and transport properties, hydrogels have significant applications in diverse areas such as tissue engineering [9,10], drug delivery [11,12], water purification [13–17],\nTrends in Chemistry, June 2019, Vol. 1, No. 3 10.1016/j.trechm.2019.03.005 335 © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\nand biomedical engineering [18–22]. Gelation chemistry provides a versatile approach to the rational design of hydrogels to meet the demanding requirements of electrodes, conductive binders, and electrolytes in energy-storage devices through building block tailoring, topological structure adjustment [23], and functional additive integration (Figure 1). With the remarkable tunability of each element, hydrogels are capable of providing high ionic conductivity, electronic conductivity [24], electrochemical activity [25], structuralflexibility [26], and electrolyte permeability [2] to improve energy-storage device performance. In this minireview, we discuss the unique ways in which hydrogelshavebeen employed askey materials inenergy-storage devices, such asalkalimetal batteries and supercapacitors. Recent progress on hydrogel-based tunable architectures, conductive nanostructures, 3D frameworks, and multifunctional materials is summarized with examples to reveal their vital role in next-generation energy-storage devices."

(B) Crosslinking hydrogel in the presence of functional materials that can be coated by hydrogel through in situ crosslinking. (C) Nanostructured hydrogel-derived inorganic frameworks by carbonization (top) and sintering (bottom).\n(Figure 2A) [27]. The primary factors affecting hydrogel gelation include monomer/polymer functional-group and backbone chemistry, crosslinking-agent chemistry and density, functional additives, and synthesis environment (e.g., temperature, pH, ionic strength) [28,29]. Typically, hydrogels are synthesized in an aqueous electrolyte that can be an acid, alkaline, or neutral solution, where desired salts [e.g., sulfuric acid (H2SO4), potassium hydroxide (KOH), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) for supercapacitors] are dissolved in water as the solvent [24]. The resulting gels contain highly polar functional groups (e.g., -OH, -COOH, -COO , -CONH2) that strongly interact with water molecules to promote aqueous solubility [18]. The degree of swelling is determined largely by the balance between the increased entropy due to mixing the polymer with a solution and the elastic retractive force resulting from the reduction in the number of possible chain conformations as the polymer network swells [30]. In the case of ionic gels containing charged functional groups, electrostatic interactions also contribute significantly to gel swelling (i.e., Donnan equilibrium). The highly tailorable synthesis and the abundance of potential postsynthetic modifications of hydrogels enables a variety of applications in energy-storage devices with favorable properties including electrochemical stability, ionic/ electronic conductivity, and mechanical strength.\nIn addition to ionically conductive hydrogels that are often used as electrolytes due to their high ionic conductivity stemming from high water content, electronically conductive hydrogels with hierarchical pores enable mixed ionic and electronic conductors (MIECs). Electronically conducting polymers are conjugated molecules with backbone chains containing alternating single and double bonds. Typically, undoped conjugated polymers are semiconductors or insulators with very low conductivities (from 10 5 to 10 10 S cm 1). However, doping (even at very low levels) enables significantly increased electronic conductivities (from 1 to 10 4 S cm 1) [31]. Figure 2B shows an exemplary synthesis process for a conductive hydrogel electrode for batteries where electronically conductive polymers are dissolved in an aqueous electrolyte together with functional nanomaterials (active electrode particles). Following hydrogel synthesis, the functional nanomaterials are embedded in the crosslinked hydrogels. Depending on the application, the hydrogel is then dried and swollen by a desired liquid electrolyte (e.g., organic electrolyte). In these conductive hydrogels, electronically conductive polymer chains are crosslinked to enable a continuous electron transport pathway. Meanwhile, the hierarchical\nTrends in Chemistry, June 2019, Vol. 1, No. 3 337\nhydrophilic pores facilitate ion diffusion and liquid transport. Therefore, the functional nanoparticles embedded in the hydrogel matrix have access to both electrons (e ) and ions (A+) that are highly favorable for redox reactions in most of the electrodes for energy-storage systems.\nHydrogels can also be used as precursors or templates. Owing to their hierarchically porous structure, hydrogels are excellent templates for the fabrication of 3D interconnected inorganic frameworks by pyrolysis, thermal annealing, or other thermal methods. Figure 2C provides two representative examples utilizing hydrogels as a precursor. Hydrophilic polymer chains are crosslinked in aqueous solution along with nanoparticles or precursors, such as active electrode precursors [e.g., lithium sulfate (Li2SO4)] [32,33] or metal-oxide salts {e.g., lithium nitrate (LiNO3), lanthanum(III) nitrate hexahydrate [La(NO3)3] 6H2O} [34,35]. In the case of carbon frameworks, a crosslinked hydrogel is heat treated under an inert or a reducing atmosphere such as argon (Ar), nitrogen (N2), or Ar/N2 + hydrogen (H2) [32,33]. Since the polymers are a carbon source, heat treatment of the hydrogel in reducing environment results in a 3D hierarchically porous carbon framework where functional nanomaterials are embedded as shown at the top of Figure 2C [32,33]. 3D porous metal-oxide or ceramic frameworks can be derived via heat treatment of hydrogels in an oxidizing atmosphere [34,35]. During hydrogel synthesis, metal ions can be uniformly mixed and stabilized within a covalently crosslinked polymer network [36]. Thehydrogels containing precursors are then typically dried and heat treated in an oxidizing atmosphere (often in ambient air) as shown at the bottom of Figure 2C. The oxide framework can be made with a conventional solid-state electrolyte as well as electrode materials for batteries, which can be synthesized in an oxidizing atmosphere [e.g., lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2)] or in a reducing atmosphere [e.g., lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4)] [34,35,37].\nFabrication methods are not limited to the examples introduced in this section. One can modify the aforementioned synthetic processes to produce a variety of hydrogels for energy-storage applications, such as incorporating block copolymers [38], forming interpenetrating polymer networks [39], changing the level of doping or concentration of charge carriers [40,41], or adjusting crosslinking density [42]. Overall, gelation chemistry and various synthetic approaches provide significant opportunity to rationally design hydrogels to meet the demanding requirements of energy-storage devices."

      "text" : "Hydrogels as Electrolytes A primary application for hydrogels in energy-storage devices is as the ionically conducting electrolyte. Due to their high ionic conductivity and dimensional stability, various energy-storage devices have utilized hydrogel electrolytes, including supercapacitors and batteries. For example, Wang and colleagues reported a chemically crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel electrolyte for supercapacitors [43]. Prior tohydrogel-basedelectrolytes, commercial separators [e.g.,polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP)] suffered from limited ionic conductivity [44]. Here, however, the PVA hydrogel electrolyte exhibited ahigh ionicconductivity of8.2 10 2 S cm 1, close to that ofa typicalaqueous H2SO4 electrolyte ( 10 1 S cm 1) (Figure 3A) [43]. Recently, hydrogel electrolytes were also employed in batteries [45,46]. For example, Li and colleagues reported a hierarchical polymer electrolyte fabricated by grafting polyacrylamide (PAM) onto gelatin chains that filled in a polyacrylonitrile (PAN)nanofibermatrix (Figure3B) [45].Theresulting ionicconductivity (1.76 10 2 S cm 1) is significantly greater than those of conventional zinc-ion gel electrolytes (10 3 10 8 S cm 1) and close to those of liquid electrolytes (10 1 10 2 S cm 1) [47,48]. In addition to high ionic conductivity, hydrogels exhibit highly tunable mechanical properties (e.g., elasticity, flexibility) that can improve the performance of energy-storage devices. Lopez and colleagues fabricated highly elastic hydrogel electrolytes via a double-network design [46]. In this design, covalent crosslinks provide\n338 Trends in Chemistry, June 2019, Vol. 1, No. 3\n(A)\n(C)\n(E) (F) (H)\n(G)\n(D)\n(B)\nPolypyrrole\nCuPcTs\nTetrafunc onal groups\nCycle\nDi sc\nha rg\ne ca\npa ci\nty (m\nAh /g\n)\n0 0\n10 20 30 40\n40\n80\n120\n160\n200\n50\n0.2 C 0.5C 0.5C\n1 C 2 C\n5 C 10 C\n20 C 30 C\nC·LFP control C·LFP/C·PPy\nAnionic monomer\nCa onic monomer\nChemical crosslinking\n(S1) PVA-H2SO4 mixed solu on\n(S2) PVA-H2SO4 chemical hydrogel\n: Gela n chain\nGela n K2S2O6\n: Acrylamide : PAM chain : PAN fiber\nS rred at 80°C S rred at 40°C\nPAN membrane\nHPE\nHeated at 60°C\nFigure 3.

The resulting solid polymer electrolyte shows a high ionic conductivity that is several orders higher than conventional lithium-ion polymer electrolytes with a high resilience that is comparable with that of Kevlar-based polymer electrolytes [49].\nTo enhance hydrogel ionic conductivity further, ionizable functional groups are often introduced into the polymer network, typically referred to as polyelectrolyte (either positively or negatively charged), polyampholyte (both positively and negatively charged), or zwitterionic (with monomers possessing both positively and negatively charged groups) networks. Figure 3C shows a cartoon structure of polyampholyte hydrogel that was polymerized by both cationic and anionic monomers creating a network containing oppositely charged functional groups [41]. Due to electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, the polyampholyte hydrogel exhibits selfhealing and mechanical stability. In addition, the existing counter ions (along with high water retention) in charged polymers enable a high conductivity. Zwitterions have also been used to synthesize a hydrogel electrolyte where the polymers have separate positively and negatively charged groups (Figure 3D) [50].\nHydrogels as Electrodes and Binders To be suitable for electrodes or binders in batteries and supercapacitors, both ionic and electronic conductivity are required to facilitate the transport of all species involved in the electrochemical reactions. To achieve this end, hydrogels may be synthesized via crosslinking conductive monomers/polymers, such that electron transport occurs along the conductive polymer chains while ions are conducted through the liquid electrolyte within the hydrogel meshes [51]. Shi and colleagues reported a conductive hydrogel binder for lithium-ion batteries [52]. As shown in Figure 3E, the 3D hierarchical structure of the conductive hydrogel network provides continuous electron conduction pathways through the interconnected conductive polymer chains. Meanwhile, the water- and ion-rich meshes of the hydrogel facilitate the diffusion of ions (Figure 3F). Conductive hydrogel binders can perform as both ionic and electronic conductors, improving the rate performance of lithium-ion batteries up to 30C (i.e., 30 times of discharge in 1 h) (Figure 3G). In addition to improved charge transport, the 3D porous nanostructure and improved elasticity of the hydrogel binder can accommodate volume changes of active materials during charge/discharge exhibiting long-term cycling stability.\nThrough rational selection of crosslinking agent type and density, unique morphologies and electrochemical properties can be obtained. Wang and coworkers reported nanostructured conductive hydrogels with polypyrrole (PPy) as the conductive polymer and a disk-shaped liquid crystal [i.e., copper phthalocyanine-3,40,400,4000-tetra sulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (CuPcTs)] that functions as a dopant and crosslinking agent (Figure 3H) [42]. Due to the steric and electrostatic interaction between PPy and CuPcTs, PPy favorably forms 1D chains. However, these 1D chains are crosslinked by CuPcTs (CuPcTs-doped PPy), further forming a 3D interconnected hydrogel. CuPcTs-doped PPy shows more than two orders of magnitude enhancement in conductivity (7.8 S cm 1) compared with that of pure PPy (7 10 2 S cm 1). The dopant CuPcTs not only crosslinks 1D PPy chains but also enhances interchain charge transport between 1D chains leading to significantly enhanced conductivity.\nAlthough the high elasticity and mechanical strength of hydrogels have enabled their use in flexible devices, the mechanical and electrochemical properties often conflict with each other. Regarding the electrochemical performance, the hydrogel-based materials demonstrated limited better performance compared with conventional materials. To further improve hydrogel-based materials, deep understanding of phase structure is required. In particular, the\n340 Trends in Chemistry, June 2019, Vol. 1, No. 3\nproperties of MIEC hydrogels are complicated to evaluate since the ionic and electronic conduction and the electrochemical properties in the hydrogel can be studied only empirically by measuring cell performance. For future studies, advanced characterization is required to elucidate the exact mechanism of ionic and electronic conduction in the polymer, liquid, or polymer–liquid interphase."

      "text" : "Inorganic nanomaterials (e.g., conductive carbon or oxide nanoparticles) have been widely used in energy-storage devices, especially as composite electrode materials. However, typical mixing of nanoparticles with base materials such as polymers often results in agglomeration of nanoparticles and, consequently, decreased surface area and connectivity. To address this issue, previous studies modified the fabrication process of the composite materials, such as electric-field alignment of nanoparticles [53], the ice-templating method [54], or using highaspect-ratio (1D or 2D) nanofillers [55]. Despite these improvements, the most effective way is to form a 3D network of the desired materials. Hydrogels have a 3D interconnected nano/ microstructure with water imbibed within the hydrogel matrix that can dissolve precursors. Recent studies show that various 3D inorganic frameworks can be derived from the heat treatment of a mixture of a hydrogel with functional materials or precursors; this demonstrates significant advantages over conventional discrete particles of lower dimension.\nElectrode materials have been prepared by heat treatment of a hydrogel to form uniformly distributed active materials in the carbon framework. For the cathode material of a lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery, Zhang and colleagues fabricated an N,P-codoped carbon framework from a hydrogel [32]. In their work, prefabricated Li2SO4 nanoparticles with carbon (Li2SO4/C) were mixed with phytic acid-doped polyaniline (P-PANI). After in situ polymerization, the hydrogel was coated on a substrate followed by heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere (Figure 4A). As a result of the carbothermic reduction of Li2SO4 and carbonization of P-PANI, a hierarchically porous carbon framework was obtained where Li2S nanoparticles are embedded; the 3D hierarchical structure enables exceptional ion and electron transport (Figure 4B). In addition to providing a carbon source, P-PANI also functions as source for N and P dopants. Importantly, N,P doping can improve the electrochemical reaction kinetics and reduce undesired dissolution of polysulfides through the strong interaction between S and P. For the anode material of a lithium-ion battery, Shi and colleagues developed Sn-Fe alloys in a 3D carbon framework (Sn-Fe@C framework) from a double-network nanostructured hydrogel [33]. Figure 4C shows the fabrication process that includes metal salts dissolved in the hydrogel, freeze drying to form an aerogel, and pyrolysis at high temperature. The ternary product of the Sn, Fe, and C elements is well distributed over each 1D nanodendrite building unit in the entire 3D hierarchical Sn-Fe@C framework, leading to enhanced cycling stability, reversible capacity, and rate capability (Figure 4D).\nMetal-oxide frameworks have also been prepared for several energy-storage devices. Bae and coworkers developed a facile method to fabricate 3D Li0.35La0.55TiO3 (LLTO) ceramic frameworks for composite polymer electrolytes [34]. Conventional particle-based composite polymer electrolytes suffer from agglomeration of particles that leads to low ionic conductivity. Here, however, the 3D interconnected ceramic framework formed a continuous ion-conducting pathway without agglomeration of particles (Figure 4E). The 3D hydrogel framework containing evenly distributed metal-salts precursors resulted in LLTO nanoframeworks with an interconnected structure (left image of Figure 4F). The composite electrolyte with 3D framework shows a bicontinuous structure of LLTO and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) leading to high lithium-ion conductivity ( 10 4 S cm 1 at room temperature) (right image of Figure 4F).

      "text" : "Hydrogels have incredible tunability through modification of functional groups and the incorporation of functional materials [27,56,57]. Thus, hydrogels can be synthesized that possess important features including stimulus responsiveness [58–61], self-healing [62,63], and extreme flexibility [64–68] and stretchability [69,70]. Over the past few years, functional hydrogels have been investigated to address the failure modes of energy-storage devices (e.g., lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors) that remain prevalent [71–73]. Recently, thermal runaway associated with these devices was addressed using a thermoresponsive polymer with a sol–gel or phase transition at the relevant temperature [74–78]. For example, Yu and colleagues introduced a new electrolyte based on a thermoplastic elastomer with a reversible sol–gel transition [79]. This thermoresponsive Pluronic-based electrolyte inhibits ion transport by transitioning to a gel above a tunable operating temperature, triggering shutdown to protect the device (Figure 5A). The transition temperature can be adjusted by tuning the concentration and average molecular weight of the polymer to meet specific device requirements. Cyclic voltammetry measurements of supercapacitors using this electrolyte demonstrate high and stable capacitance with excellent reversibility, suggesting its practicality in lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells.\nSimilar to the above sol–gel transition mechanism, Bao and coworkers reported a reversible thermoresponsive polymer that could incorporate into electrodes to prevent thermal runaway [80]. When the battery is overheated, the current collector (coated with a thin thermoresponsive polymer) increases resistance by separating conductive particles via the expansion of polymer matrix (Figure 5B). On cooling, the battery resumes normal function as the polymer shrinks to recover conductive pathways. The designs incorporated with polymer gels provide a reliable strategy toachieve safer, improvedperformance.Conductive, interpenetratingnetworkhydrogels that are extremely sensitive to changes in temperature were developed by Yu and coworkers [81]. This interpenetrating network inhibited the aggregation of polymer particles and provides continuous conduction pathways for electron transport, thus achieving high electrical conductivity.\nIn addition to stimulus responsiveness, self-healing hydrogels are also attractive for electrochemical energy-storage devices [82–86]. A hybrid hydrogel comprising metal-ligand supramolecules and PPy was reported with efficient self-healing behavior at room temperature without any external stimulus [87]. Figure 5C demonstrates that the combination of dynamic intermolecular interaction and coordination can drive the reassembly of supramolecules to self-heal cracks. Here, the lightbulb can light again when the circuit is reestablished, owing to the dynamic assembly or disassembly of the supramolecular matrix. Another work from Zhiand coworkers reported an electrolyte comprising polyacrylic acid dual crosslinked by hydrogen bonding and vinyl hybrid silica nanoparticles (VSNPsPAA), which also exhibits self-healing properties [88]. This self-healing feature is due to the formation of abundant reversible intermolecular hydrogen bond crosslinks. The broken hydrogen bonds recombine through the coordination of carboxyl groups on the PAA polymer chains. A facile supercapacitor made from this new hydrogel electrolyte provides a hint for future portable and wearable energy-storage devices. Overall, self-healing of hydrogel potentially enhances stability, increases lifetime, and reduces the safety hazards associated with energy-storage devices [63,88].\nTo enable next-generationwearable and portableenergy-storage electronics, significant research effort has been expended toward the development of scalable methods of fabricating selfstanding and flexible electrode-based hydrogels [1,25,89–91].

      "text" : "Functional hydrogels are an emerging class of materials that exhibit several unique advantages over conventional nanomaterials. Importantly, hydrogels exhibit well-formed interconnected networks with enhanced connectivity, high surface area, and mechanical strength. Due to strong interaction with water molecules, hydrogels also have high retention capacity for aqueous electrolytes, often affording high ionic conductivity. Besides facilitating charge/mass transport, interconnected polymers with hierarchical pores can also accommodate large volume changes of the active material in the electrode during the charge/discharge process. It is also possible for hydrogels to be used as templates for the fabrication of a versatile suite of inorganic frameworks. Additionally, an abundant selection of polymers, dopants, and functional components can be incorporated into hydrogels to satisfy a wide variety of design needs.\nSeveral key challenges remain for hydrogel materials to be optimized for energy-storage devices (see Outstanding Questions). While hydrogels function as aqueous electrolytes, the electrochemical reaction is limited since the stable voltage window is constrained. In addition, the use of water as a solvent inhibits a wide range of operational temperatures. Improvement of electrochemical properties along with higher mechanical stability remains to be fully investigated. Fundamental understanding of hydrogels is also required, including surface-chemistry effects on charge transport and electrochemical kinetics at the hybrid interface of polymer, electrolyte, and inorganic materials. With the development of novel gelation strategies and advanced functional elements, we anticipate that hydrogel-based materials will play an even greater role in energy-storage applications in thenear future (Figure 6).Thecombination of these properties (Figure 6) can provide further opportunities for portable, wearable, and clinical innovations. Ultimately, advances in hydrogel materials should aim to achieve optimal designs to solve the performance, cost, and ecofriendliness challenges in next-generation energy-storage technologies."

    "abstractText" : "The diversity of hydrogel materials allows them to be used as various components in energy-storage systems, including electrodes, functional binders, and electrolytes. Functional hydrogels are an attractive material platform for energy-storage technologies. Thus, the development of hydrogels with enhanced physicochemical properties (e.g., improved mechanical strength, flexibility, and charge transport) offers new opportunities for next-generation batteries and supercapacitors. Armed with a deeper understanding of gelation chemistry, researchers have made significant strides toward fabricating hydrogels that are stimulus responsive, self-healing, and highly stretchable. In this short review, we highlight how hydrogels have been integrated into batteries and supercapacitors and provide exciting examples that demonstrate the versatility of hydrogels; namely, tailorable architectures, conductive nanostructures, 3D frameworks, and multifunctionalities. It is anticipated that creative and combinatorial approaches used in the design of functional hydrogels will continue to yield materials with great potential in the field of energy storage.",
