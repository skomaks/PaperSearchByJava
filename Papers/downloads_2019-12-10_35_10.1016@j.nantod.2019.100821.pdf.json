Recent advances in nanowire-based bioelectronics [4], which can reach critical biological length scales of a few tens of nanometers, represent attractive candidates for next-generation cell electrophysiology tools that enable parallel and long-term detection of intracellular activity with high spatial resolution.\nThe first work describing nanowire-enabled intracellular probes for electrogenic cells was achieved by the synthesis of nonlinear kinked nanowires, with a point-like field-effect transistor (FET) synthetically encoded at the tip [6]. Modification of the surfaces of the kinked nanowire FET probes with phospholipid bilayers yielded spontaneous insertion through the cell membrane of beating cardiomyocytes and subsequent intracellular action potential recording with an average peak amplitude of ∼80 mV as expected for these cells. To provide deterministic control over probe–cell interactions, kinked nanowire FETs have also been fabricated on the tip of free-standing probes that can be manipulated in 3D [7]. Significantly, simultaneous nanowire FET and patch-clamp recording from the same beating cardiomyocytes showed that the kinked\nobes could drive high-resolution brain-machine interfaces, Nano\nnanowire probes recorded the same absolute intracellular signals as the standard of electrophysiology without any correction factors, thus opening up new capabilities in terms of spatial resolution and biomimetic cellular targeting. However, the kinked nanowire syn-\nFig. 1.

These nanowires typically ave a height of a few micrometers, a diameter of tens to hunreds of nanometers. When cells are cultured on top of electrode rrays, the plasma membrane deforms and wraps around elecrode, creating a tight junction at the interface [10]. Intracellular ccess can then be achieved by controlled membrane disruption, uch as electroporation in which the application of voltage/current ulses at the nanowire tips transiently disrupt the local membrane atch [11,12]. Typically, the measured action potential amplitude s significantly increased immediately following electroporation, nd gradually decreases over time as the membrane reseals. The op-down processes used to fabricate vertical nanowire arrays re intrinsically scalable and can be integrated with complemenary metal-oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to enable parallel n vitro recording from thousands of connected cardiomyocytes nd neurons [13,14]. Nevertheless, these studies also have limiations, including (i) the intracellular potentials are much lower han the signals expected for true intracellular recording, (ii) the ignal-to-noise ratio depends on the electrochemical impedance f the fabricated metal nanowires, and (iii) the positions of the anowires relative to the cultured cells cannot be manipulated. dditionally, the 2D substrate-based nanowire array platforms are ot compatible with minimally-invasive 3D in vivo recording.\nPlease cite this article as: A. Zhang, Y. Zhao, S.S. You et al., Nanowire pr Today, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nantod.2019.100821\nTo address the limitations of synthesized kinked nanowire evices and fabricated vertical nanowire arrays, we have recently eveloped a scalable approach to U-shaped silicon nanowire arrays Fig. 1a (iv)) [15]. The approach combines previous advances\ny the ultrasmall U-shaped nanowire transistor probes has demonstrated minimal anowire probe arrays could enable network-level parallel recording in vitro or in\nin deterministic shape-controlled nanowire transfer [16] with spatially defined semiconductor-to-metal transformation [17] to realize scalable nanowire FET probe arrays with controllable tip geometry and sensor size. Significantly, these new scalable probes enable parallel recording of intracellular action potentials from primary neurons.\nThe silicon nanowires, with length-to-width ratio of more than 3000, are as flexible as cooked noodles. After bottom-up synthesis, they typically have disordered arrangement and orientations on the growth substrate. To incorporate them into functional device arrays that read intracellular electrical activities, we first patterned a silicon wafer with U-shaped polymer trenches, and then ‘comb’ the nanowires over the trenches [16]. In addition to removing tangles from the nanowire hair, the combing process forces the nanowires to conform to the designed U-shaped trenches, thus forming an array of ‘hairpin’-like U-shaped nanoscale devices. The center of each U-shaped nanowire, which points upward from the wafer surface, is defined as a small FET recorder by controlled semiconductor-to-metal transformation of the nanowire arms [17], and can be inserted into the targeted neurons and cardiac cells for intracellular recording of signals up to or exceeding 100 mV which is comparable to the quality of those obtained with the patch-clamp electrodes. In addition, the cell-membrane mimicking phospholipid bilayer coating on the surfaces of the U-shaped nanowires allowed repeated insertion into multiple cells in parallel without causing damage.\nDuring the development of the nanowire probes, we also compared many different curvatures of the U-shaped nanowire probe\nobes could drive high-resolution brain-machine interfaces, Nano\ntips by varying systematically the top-down fabricated U-shaped trenches as well as different sizes of the FET devices. Importantly, this demonstrated a strong correlation between probes with smaller curvature/FET sizes, ease of internalization and larger\nING ModelN t al. /\nr r t i [ u c\ne p t a s m t (\na e i e r i F a L t s i c i s i a o f u n n i b\nA\ne a\nR\n[\n[\n[ [\n[\n[\n[\n[ [ [\n[\n[\n[ [\nnanoscience and emerging nanotechnologies, including ground-breaking advances at the boundary between nanoelectronics and medicine as well as the developing the first three-dimensional nanoelectronic arrays that can be seamlessly integrated into the brain.

These findings are consistent with the eported results demonstrating that the cell membrane curvaure induced by tight interfacing with smaller nanostructures can nduce activation of endocytosis and related biological pathways 18], indicating that using nanoscale topography to enhance device ptake is critical for developing tools that faithfully capture intraellular action potential features.\nTaking advantage of the parallel fabrication approach, we also xplored different configurations of the device arrays: for examle, having multiple nanowire devices on a single probe arm such hat it is possible to read from multiple locations in a single cell, s well as ten of the probes that record signals from adjacent cells imultaneously to study signal propagation between cells. These odifications have the potential to make better tools for decoding he communication within and between complex neuron networks Fig. 1b).\nThe human brain contains about 86 billion neurons, and they re wired into complex circuits to process information conveyed by lectrical signals. To study a large number of neurons in the brain via ntracellular recording, the conventional method of patch-clamp lectrode is limited by its large micrometer tip size, and it can only ead from a few neurons at a time. Recent advances in nanowire ntracellular probes have achieved parallel fabrication of nanowire ET arrays, thereby addressing the long-standing challenge of scalble intracellular electrical recording with minimal invasiveness. ooking into the future, this deterministic nanowire-based fabricaion strategy could be incorporated into other platforms [19–21], uch as syringe-injectable mesh electronics [19], for multi-site 3D n vivo measurements. Two key challenges for the in vivo appliations are the difficulty to achieve tight membrane/nanowire nterfaces and long-term stability of the intracellular recording. We uggest that future studies exploring either (1) chemical anchorng via surface functionalization with groups that can bind to the ctin cytoskeletal [22] or (2) physical anchoring using modulation f nanowire morphology [23] to increase the physical detachment orce could improve the stability of the intracellular device configration. Stable recording and interrogation of the same individual eurons in the neuron networks promises to help decipher complex eurological disorders [2], which develop over time, thus drivng advanced BMIs with higher resolution, and perhaps eventually ringing ‘cyborgs’ to reality.\ncknowledgements\nC.M.L. acknowledges support from the Air Force Office of Scintific Research (FA9550-18-1-0469, FA9550-19-1-0246).
