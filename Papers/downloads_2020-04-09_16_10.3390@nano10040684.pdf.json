      "text" : "Contamination of the aquatic environments due to the industrial effluents of several products, is considered to be a global challenge. Varied industries including silk, wool, leather, cotton,\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 684; doi:10.3390/nano10040684 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nand paper discharge enormous amounts of hazardous organic water-coloring agents (dyes) in water. The continuous discharge of water–soluble organic dyes, even at low concentrations, into the aquatic system is extremely harmful and dangerous for human beings [1–3]. Acute exposure to methylene blue (MB) for instance, can cause increased heart rate, vomiting, shock, cyanosis, jaundice and quadriplegia, and irritation to the skin in humans [4]. Methylene blue (MB), one of the common basic water-soluble dyes, is used for dyeing leather, cotton, printing, calico, tannin, as well as for medicinal purposes [5]. On the other hand, contamination via malachite green (MG), a common cationic dye, was reported to cause carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and teratogenicity [6]. Several methods with tunable operation conditions were proposed to purify water from organic dyes, including biological treatment, adsorption, coagulation, or precipitation. Among them techniques based on adsorption processes are most frequently used and preferred because of their effectiveness, low cost, and simplicity [7,8]. In general, adsorption of different water contaminates (heavy metals, dyes, anions, and drug residuals) using low-cost materials is a prosperous approach toward a sustainable and green-oriented future. Therefore, different clay-based adsorbents such as kaolin [9], smectite [10], raw and acid-activated bentonite [11], fibrous clay minerals [12], and red mud [13] were used to remove MB from polluted water. On the other hand, bentonite [14], halloysite nanotubes [15], natural zeolite [16], and neem sawdust [17] were used for MG uptake. Moreover, those low-cost natural materials can be further used to prepare composite sorbents with enhanced properties; one of the desired properties of the sorbent is the possibility of its easy separation using contactless magnetic forces. To achieve that the mineral phase can be used to form composite with magnetically active phase, like magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (MNP). MNP are characterized by high surface area, biocompatibility, great number of active sites, and fast adsorbent separation from solution through magnetic field [18]. After the application of magnetic field to separate the adsorbent, varied desorbing agents can be used to remove the attached pollutants from magnetic nanoparticles and therefore MNP can be reused [19]. The synthetic MNP-coated natural and waste materials were applied significantly in the decontamination of organic pollutants [19,20]. Serpentine (SP, Mg3Si2O5(OH)4) is formed by the alteration of Mg–rich silicate minerals such as pyroxene and olivine, producing the three common silicate minerals chrysotile, antigorite, and lizardite. Structurally, SP has an octahedral brucite sheet and two silica tetrahedral sheets. In addition to magnesium and silicon, aluminum, iron, and nickel can be included in the SP composition. Although serpentine is widely distributed in Egypt, eco-friendly, wide-ranging composition, and low-cost, its potential environmental applications related to the removal of hazardous species from waters and wastewaters were not considered. Recently, exfoliation of the 2:1 layered structure of SP by H2O2 resulted in facilitating the grafting of the cationic surfactant in its structure, which frequently improved the adsorption capacity of SP for Cr(VI) and fluoride [21]. The aim of this work is to synthesize a composite of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and H2O2–activated serpentine (MNP/SP) for the removal of cationic dyes (MB and MG) from contaminated aqueous solutions. The effect of different parameters on the uptake capability and the adsorption mechanism were investigated. Finally, kinetics and equilibrium studies were interpreted in the current study."

Based on the R2 values, the pseudo second-order equation (R2 > 0.99) fitted well with the MB and MG adsorption processes as compared to the pseudo first-order (R2 < 0.95). Moreover, the calculated qe obtained from the pseudo-second order fitting is very close with the experimental qe values confirming the validity of this model in fitting the MG and MB data. The fitting with the intra-particle diffusion model is shown in Figures S2 and S3. During all periods of interaction times, the plot was divided into three lines. The first sharp line could be linked to the external mass transfer of MG and MB from\nthe contaminated solution to the external active sites of the MNP/SP composite [38]. The lines 2 and 3 reflected the control of pore-diffusion and saturation stages, respectively [30]. The non-linear plots of the pseudo first-order and the pseudo second-order kinetic models of MB and MG are presented in Figure S3 and the obtained parameters are listed in Table S2."

      "text" : "Based on Langmuir assumption, MB and MG adsorption occurs at similar active sites of the prepared MNB/SP composite. The qmax and b parameters of Langmuir model were calculated from the relation between of Ce/qe and Ce (Figure S4) and the results are given in Table S3. The dimensionless separation factor (Rs) of the Langmuir isotherm model was determined from the following equation [38].\nRs = 1\n1 + kL C0 (5)\nThe calculated Rs values are in the range 0.05–0.09 for MB and MG indicating favorable adsorption processes of both dyes. According to Freundlich equation, uptake of MB and MG takes place at heterogeneous active sites forming more than one layer (multilayer) onto the MNP/SP surface. Indeed, apart from monolayer formation governed by electrostatic interactions, some part of the dyes can be adsorbed by π–π interactions between the dyes molecules [36]. The parameters of Freundlich model (KF and n) were determined (cf. Table S3) from the linear relation between log qe versus log Ce (Figure S4). The relation between Ce and qe was used in fitting the MB and MG experimental data to the non-linear forms of Langmuir and Freundlich models and the obtained parameters are given in Table S2. Based on R2 values determined for the two models (cf. Table S3), it can be concluded that adsorption of MB and MG dyes can be fitted using both of them. The most important outcome that can be derived from all the above presented and discussed results is that the removal efficiency of the composite is almost equal for both dyes. Considering the molecular weight of MB (319.9 mol g−1) and MG (364.9 mol g−1), we can suggest that specific sites are responsible for the adsorption. Comparing the molecular structures (cf. Figure 1), it can be also suggested that the size and chemical differences does not affect the interactions involved in adsorption, since adsorption is driven by the interactions of the terminal amine groups located on the edges of the dyes molecules, thus equally accessible for both dyes regardless of their molecular sizes.\n3.6. Comparison of the MNP/SP Adsorbent with Other Studies\nTable 1 collects the values of maximum adsorption capacities of MB and MG by the as-synthesized MNP/SP of this study as compared to natural and modified materials. Based on the qmax values of MB (201 mg g−1) and MG (218 mg g−1), the MNP/SP sorbent is measured as a promising composite for the removal of the selected cationic organic dyes (MB and MG) from the contaminated solutions."

With increasing the solution temperature to 60 ◦C, the adsorbed amounts decreased to 70 and 73 mg g−1 for MB and MG, respectively. The observed decrease testifies to the exothermic nature of adsorption processes occurring during uptakes of the dyes [45]."

      "heading" : "3.8. Effect of Salinity on MB and MG Adsorption",
      "text" : "Dyeing method is associated with increasing salt concentration and therefore, the ionic strength effect on the MG and MB adsorption onto the MNP/SP was investigated. It was observed that with an increase in the salt concentration from 0.2 to 1.2 g L−1, the removed amounts were decreased from 88 to 73 mg g−1 in case of MG and from 84 to 71 mg g−1 in case of MB (Figure 5c). This may be due to the screening effect of salt ions, which resulted in suppressing the electrostatic attractions between MNP/SP adsorbent and the dyes molecules [46]. Furthermore, this decrease in the uptake values can be related to the occupation of some MNP/SP active sites by sodium ions."

      "text" : "Possibility of the multiple use of any sorbent is one of the most important issues determining the possibility of its real use in adsorption-based industrial processes [47–52]. Herein, five adsorption/ desorption cycles were run to evaluate the possibility of regeneration and reusing of the synthesized composite sorbent. The results are presented in Figure 5d. As it can be seen the regenerated sorbent maintained high sorption retention effectiveness after five cycles toward both dyes. The adsorption capacity of the sorbent after four adsorption/desorption cycles is 73% and 78% for MB and MG, respectively. The decrease of sorption capacities for all the samples can be linked with two possible factors: (i) Irreversible adsorption of some amount of the dyes that could not be desorbed using 0.5 NaOH and (ii) gradual elimination of porosity and surface chemistry upon processing (including water-driven processes occurring during sorption cycles and NaOH-driven during desorption cycles). Nevertheless, the observed retention of adsorption effectiveness toward MB and MG after five cycles clearly showed the applicability of the obtained sorbent."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "A new composite of activated serpentine and magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles was successfully fabricated, characterized, and tested as adsorbent of two cationic dyes (methylene blue and malachite green). The sorbent exhibited the maximum adsorption uptake at pH = 8. Kinetic data revealed that the equilibrium was reached after 120 min of shaking time and the adsorption rate followed the pseudo second-order kinetic model. The obtained sorbent could adsorb as much as 162 mg g−1 of MB and 176 mg g−1 of MG. The sorbent could be easily regenerated using diluted NaOH solution and reused many times while maintaining over 70% effectiveness after five adsorption cycles. This study clearly shows that serpentine-derived composite materials can be successfully used for fast, efficient, and cost-effective adsorptive removal of hazardous dyes from waters and wastewaters. Moreover, the interactions with the adsorbent surface occur via the cationic amine functionalities, since the adsorption-desorption capability was found similar for both MB and MG.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/4/684/s1, Figure S1: Effect of contact time (a), fitting the kinetic data with pseudo-first-order (b), pseudo-second-order (c),\nand intra-particle diffusion model (d) on MB uptake; Figure S2: Effect of contact time (a), fitting of the kinetic data with pseudo-first order (b), pseudo-second order (c), and intra-particle diffusion model (d) on MG uptake; Figure S3: The non-linear plots of the pseudo-first order and the pseudo-second order kinetic models of MB and MG adsorption onto MNP/SP composite; Figure S4: Linear Langmuir fitting (a,b), linear Freundlich fitting (c,d), and the non-linear fitting using Langmuir and Freundlich models (e,f)., Table S1: Kinetics models for dye adsorption by MNP/SP composite; Table S2: Fitting the kinetic data with different kinetic models; Table S3: Parameters of isotherms models for MB and MG uptake by MNP/SP adsorbent.\nAuthor Contributions: M.K.S.: methodology, writing—original draft; M.B.: writing—review and editing; I.A.: review and editing; D.A.G.: writing—review and editing.

    "abstractText" : "A widely distributed mineral, serpentine, obtained from Wadi Ghadir (Eastern Desert in Egypt) was studied as a potential naturally and abundantly available source for the synthesis of an efficient adsorbent for aquatic remediation applications. A novel nanocomposite was synthesized after the exfoliation of the layered structure of serpentine by hydrogen peroxide treatment (serpentine (SP)), followed by decoration with magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (MNP). The goal behind the utilization of the latter phase was to increase the environmental remediation capability and to incorporate magnetic properties at the final adsorbent, toward a better separation after the use. The fabricated composite (MNP/SP) was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The composite’s potential adsorption application toward the removal of two cationic dyes, methylene blue (MB) and malachite green (MG), was investigated. The observed adsorption kinetics was fast, and the highest uptake was observed at pH = 8, with the capacities to reach 162 and 176 mg g−1 for MB and MG, respectively, values significantly higher than various other materials tested against these two cationic dyes. Compared to hydrogen peroxide-treated serpentine, the removal efficiency of the composite was higher by 157 and 127% for MB and MG, respectively. The MB and MG were adsorbed because of the favorable electrostatic interactions between MNP/SP active sites and the cationic dyes. The close value capacities suggest that the difference in chemistry of the two dyes does not affect the interactions, with the later occurring via the dyes’ amine functionalities. With increasing ionic strength, the adsorption of the studied basic dyes was slightly decreased, suggesting only partial antagonistic ion effect. The sorbent can be easily regenerated and reused without significant deterioration of its adsorption efficiency, which makes MNP/SP a promising adsorbent for the removal of hazardous pollutants from aquatic environments.",
