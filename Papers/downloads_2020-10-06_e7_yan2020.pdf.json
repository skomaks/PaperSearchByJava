Thus, PEEK implant with multi-function (osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and bacteria-killing) is essential to solve this problem. Herein, copper oxide microspheres (μCuO) decorated with silver nanoparticles (nAg) were constructed on porous PEEK surface via silk fibroin. In vitro studies highlighted the pH controlled release ability of this coating. It liberated a high dose of Cu 2 + and Ag + at low pH environment (pH 5.0), leading to 99.99% killing of planktonic bacteria and complete eradication of sessile bacteria, avoiding biofilm formation. Under physiological environment (pH 7.4), a lower amount of leaked metal ions induced promoted ALP production, collagen secretion, and calcium deposition, as well as NO production, which indicated potentiated osteogenesis and angiogenesis. In vivo results displayed the highest new bone volume around, and the appearance of new bone inside porous structure of, PEEK implant with this coating in rabbit tibia, signified the abilities of this coating to promote bone regeneration and osseointegration. Our study established solid support for implants with this coating to be a successful bone defect repair solution.\nStatement of Significance\nIn this study, CuO/Ag micro/nano particles were incorporated into the porous surface of PEEK through polydopamine and silk fibroin layers. The design of this coating conferred pH-controlled release behavior to Cu 2 + and Ag + . High dose of metal ions were released at pH 5.0, which presented synergistic antibacterial ability and killed 99.99% of planktonic bacteria. Low concentration of metal ions were controlled by this coating at physiological environment, which potentiated osteodifferentiation of Ad-MSC in vitro and led to complete integration of implant with bone tissue in vivo .\n© 2020 Acta Materialia Inc.

The autograft ad been considered the standard of bone graft replacement, and llograft is alternative to autograft. However, natural bone grafts nd implants have several limitations such as disease transfer, imited availability and reproducibility, donor scarcity, and host mmune rejection [1] . These worries led the researchers incline to-\nards using synthetic bone grafting. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK),\na [ r m l P t e o s f w\ng a s b b e e d P a p a s e i g r b o a m p T\ne T s [ a i a p c t d o a w o b\ni t t c c e fi o r b e c\nk l e a b s p t n b t (\np p t a f d v\n2\n2 m\nt b h a m 1 f t\ns m c μ n t\n2\n[ a i w t w 1 a 7\n2\nu m m a m\nsemi-crystalline polymer, is a promising alternative materials 2] . Compared with titanium alloys and other alloys, PEEK shows obust chemical resistance. Therefore there is no concerns about\netal ions released by degradation and corrosion, which may ead to systemic allergic or aseptic loosening [3] . Additionally,\nEEK possesses relatively lower elastic modulus which is similar o cortical bone, minimizing the stress shielding effect [4] . Howver, PEEK possesses inherent bioinertness, leading to insufficient sseointegration and implant-associated infection, which are conidered to be the major factor of implant failure [5] . Therefore, urther surface modifications are desirable to endow PEEK material\nith more biological properties.\nMany strategies have been carried out to ensure stable interation between bone tissue and PEEK implant as it is regarded s the prerequisite for long-term clinical success of implants [6] , uch as blending of bioactive components into, or coating with ioactive materials onto, PEEK implants [7 –9] . Nevertheless, the lended PEEK composites involve a trade-off in mechanical proprties in exchange for their increased bioactivity or need expensive quipment, and the bioactive coating on PEEK substrate will break own due to the poor binding. Alternatively, the sulfonation of EEK material to produce porous structure has been reported to be\nsimple and reliable way to enhance osseointegration of PEEK im-\nlant [10] . Nevertheless, it cannot balance implant’s osteogenesis nd antibacterial capability, lack of which may lead to secondary urgery or even amputation and death. Thus, our previously study mployed the combination of silver and gentamicin to assure mplant’s bacteria-killing capacity [4] . However, the usage of entamicin may elicit antibiotic resistance, which is now a serious isk to public health with more than 70% of hospital acquired\nacterial infections being resistant to one or more of the antibitics [11] . What’s worse, the current slow pace of antimicrobial gent development cannot catch up with the increasing number of\nultidrug-resistant bacteria [12] , which may put the world in the\nosition to face an epidemic of untreatable bacterial infections. his motivates the requirement for non-antibiotic alternatives.\nCopper, a well-known antimicrobial material, displayed synrgistic antimicrobial activities when combined with silver [13] . heir synergistic effect has been proved to be effective against reistant bacteria, which may account for increased cell permeability 14 , 15] . Hence, copper was chosen to substitute for gentamicin nd combine with silver. Their combination will not only qualify mplant with bactericidal capacity but also endow osteogenesis nd osseointegration ability to implant. The enhanced osteogenesis\nerformance is supposed to originate from the inherent nature of opper to accelerate bone regeneration by maturation of collagen hrough lysyl oxidase crosslinking and by inducing osteogenic ifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) [11] . Morever, appropriate concentration of silver, which is relatively low, lso possesses osteogenesis stimulation effect [16 , 17] . However,\nhether copper and silver are bactericidal or osteogenic depends\nn their concentration, making the dosage level of metal ions to e critical in balancing osteogenesis and bacteria-killing.\nSilk fibroin (SF), a biocompatible material, possesses different soelectric points (p I ) for different parts of its backbone, leading to he variation of electric charge and molecular conformation with he change of pH. This feature of SF could exert a pH-responsive ontrolled release of metal ions, consequently achieving low oncentration of metal ions for osteogenesis under physiological nvironment and high concentration of metal ions needed for ef-\ncient bacterial killing at low pH environment. This characteristic f coating could help implant achieve a fast and large amount elease of metal ions only at when and where bacteria appear, as acteria metabolism produces organic acid and acidifies their local nvironment [18] . Therefore, SF was chosen to be the carrier to ontrol the release of metal ions.\nw\nHowever, the two performances of osteogenesis and bacteriailling may not be able to guarantee rapid osseointegration and\nong term stability of implants, as blood vessels not only transport ssential oxygen and nutrients but also delivery osteogenic cells nd factors to the region of bone defect [19] . Furthermore, it has\neen reported that accelerated angiogenesis can lead to earlier oseointegration [20] . Thereby, equipping implants with angiogenic otential would be beneficial to the integration between bone issue and implants. Fortunately, the copper chosen before can ot only strengthen osteogenesis and bacterial killing capability, ut also promotes angiogenesis by artificially mimicking hypoxia hrough stabilizing the structure of hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1 α) which in turn stimulating the secretion of VEGF [21] . In this study, we therefore designed a three-dimension (3D) orous microstructure into PEEK surface first. Then dopamine was olymerized on the surface of PEEK as a bridge for the introducion of copper and silver loaded SF. This designation was aimed to chieve the rapid osseointegration of PEEK implants even in the ace of the bacterial infection, which can result in successful bone\nefect repair. In vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out to erify our hypothesis.\n. Materials and methods\n.1. Preparation of Ag nanoparticles decorated porous CuO\nicrospheres (μCuO/nAg)\nThe process of μCuO/nAg production is listed in Fig. 1 a. Firstly, he porous copper oxide microspheres (μCuO) were prepared y a hydrothermal method. Specifically, 2.57 g of copper nitrate ydrate Cu(NO 3 ) 2 • 3H 2 O was mixed with 80 mL of ethanol, 60 mL mmonia-water and 20 mL of sodium hydroxide (1 mM). This\nixture was transferred into a hydrothermal reactor and heated at 30 °C for 4 h. After that, μCuO were collected by centrifugation ollowed by washing three times with deionized (DI) water and hen dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The produced μCuO were added into 2 mg/mL dopamine olution (10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH = 8.5; Aladdin) with CuSO 4 (5 M) and H 2 O 2 (19.6 mM) and kept stirring for 2 h, followed by entrifuging at 80 0 0 rpm to collect polydopamine (PDA) coated CuO. Then the collected microspheres were added into silver\nitrate solution (10 mM, 30 mL) and kept stirring for 6 h. After hat, μCuO/nAg could be collected through centrifugation.\n.2. Preparation of silk fibroin solution\nSilk fibroin solution was prepared as previously described 22] . Briefly, silkworm cocoons were cut into pieces, boiled in an queous solution with 0.02 M Na 2 CO 3 for 30 min, and then rinsed n DI water. After drying at room temperature, the silk fibroin\nas dissolved into LiBr solution (9.3 M) at 60 °C till the soluion become transparent and amber in color. Then, this solution\nas dialyzed against DI water using dialysis bags (MEMBRA-CEL,\n2,0 0 0–14,0 0 0 MWCO) under stirring for 48 h before centrifuging t 80 0 0 rpm for 20 min to remove the impurities, thus yielding a -8% (w/v) silk fibroin solution.\n.3. Surface functionalization of PEEK\nMedical grade PEEK (KetaSpire, Solvay, Belgium) material was sed in this study. It was purchased in rod shape and then was\nachined into disc shape with dimension of 15 mm × 1.5 m for in vitro studies while rod shape with 2 mm in diameter nd 6 mm in length for animal evaluation. All the samples were\nechanically polished up to 20 0 0 grits and then ultrasonically ashed in acetone and ethanol.\nd a\n2\nb p S w c a\nA\nW g b\n2\nt t c t w b t\ns 2 d a\n2\n( p f e a\nThe surface modification strategy for PEEK is depicted in Fig. 1 b. PEEK material was treated with concentrated sulfuric acid (95–98 wt. %, Aldrich Chemical Corp) for 5 min under ultrasonic agitation followed by hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C for 4 h (labeled as SP). Then samples were immersed into 2 mg/mL dopamine solution (10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH = 8.5) under constant vibration at 37 °C for 12 h. After that, silk fibroin solution (5% w/v) with μCuO or μCuO/nAg was spun onto samples three times, followed by the coating of another three silk layers. The sample incorporated with μCuO was labeled as SP-CuO while the sample incorporated with μCuO/nAg was labeled SP-CuO/Ag.\n2.4. Surface characterization\nField-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) was utilized to observe the surface morphology and microstructure of coatings. For compositional analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos, UK) was employed. For surface hydrophilicity, SL200B contact angle system (Kino, USA) was utilized.\n2.5. Cu 2 + and Ag + release into phosphate buffer solution (PBS)\nTo investigate the release behavior of Cu 2 + and Ag + into PBS, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-MS, Agilent 7700, USA) was utilized to measure the concentration of ions in the solution. Briefly, specimens (SP-CuO and SP-CuO/Ag) were immersed into 2 mL of PBS with different pH (pH = 7.4, 5.0) at 37 °C for 28 days. At predetermined time points, the entire volume of solution was collected and samples were refilled with fresh PBS. The concentration of Cu 2 + and Ag + in the collected solution was determined by ICP-MS.\nTo further explore pH responsive release of metal ions, samples were immersed in 2 ml of PBS with pH of 7.4 in the first week and then immersed in PBS with pH of 5.0 for another seven days. The solution was collected and refilled at predetermined time points and the concentration of metal ions was determined by ICP-MS.\n2.6. Bacteria culture and inoculation\nGram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli ( E. coli , ATCC 25922) and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus , ATCC, 25923) were used and incubated in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 37 °C overnight. The overnight-grown bacteria were adjusted into a concentration of 1.0 × 10 6 colony forming units (CFU)/mL and then cultured with\nifferent sam ples for predesigned time periods. All experiments nd measurements were carried out in triplicate.\n.7. Antibacterial rate\nTo assess the antibacterial rate of samples, the number of viable acteria was quantified by the plate-counting method after samles incubated with 1 mL of bacterial suspension in LB medium. pecifically, samples were incubated with E. coli in LB medium\nith different pH values (7.4 and 5.0) for 6 h, while samples were ultured with S. aureus in medium with pH 7.4 for 24 h. Then the ntibacterial rate was calculated by the following formula:\nntibacterial rate ( % ) = A − B A ∗ 100% ,\nhere A is the average number of bacteria colonies on the control roup (PEEK samples, CFU/mL) while B is the average number of acteria colonies on the experimental samples.\n.8. Microbial viability assay\nThe viability of E. coli adhered to the samples was assessed by he Microbial Viability Assay Kit-WST (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) o determine their anti-adhesion ability. Briefly, samples were ultured with E. coli in LB medium with pH 7.4 or 5.0 for 6 h, then hey were taken out and washed with fresh PBS before incubating\nith LB medium which contains 5% of WST-8 reagent. After incu-\nated at 37 °C for 2 h, the absorbance of the solution was read at he wavelength of 450 nm by a microplate reader (Bio-RAD, USA).\nTo evaluate the ability of anti-attachment against S. aureus , amples were incubated with S. aureus in medium with pH 7.4 for 4 h. Then the number of viable bacteria adhered to samples was etermined by plate-counting method after samples rinsed in PBS nd ultrasonically for 10 min.\n.9. SEM observation of bacteria morphology\nAfter cultured with bacteria in LB medium with different pH 7.4 and 5.0) for 6 h for anti-adherent assay or in medium with H 5.0 for 7 d for anti-biofilm assay, samples were rinsed in PBS or three times before fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and graded thanol. Then SEM was employed to observe the morphology of dhered bacteria.\n2\nb a i t N i o M n g\na P m i\n2\nc a i s t b w e\n2\na f s T B 8 l a\n2\nh c l p t d α a α P s\n2\nfi d s w T\n1 c a w a m\n2 c\ne ( H a t w w w\nw o a a c ( q S d t n a r a a c\n2\nr P p t R S R u p g a\n2\nm w S a S t p h l t t\n.10. Membrane permeability measurement\nPropidium iodide is a fluorescent intercalating agent that can e used to stain cell. Since it is not membrane-permeable, it is lso commonly used to monitor membrane integrity. In brief, after ncubated with samples in LB medium with pH 5.0 for 6 h, baceria were collected by centrifugation and transferred into 0.85%\naCl solution which contain 3 μL/mL PI. These mixtures were kept n dark at room temperature for 15 min, followed by measurement\nf fluorescent intensity by a microplate reader (SPECTRAMAX\n5, MD, China) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 630\nm. The obtained intensities were normalized to that of PEEK roup.\nThe concentration of leaked protein in the bacteria suspension lso can be an indicator of membrane permeability. Pierce BCA rotein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA) was utilized to deter-\nine the concentration of protein in the suspension after bacteria\nncubated with samples in PBS with pH 5.0 for 6 h.\n.11. Intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)\nDCFH-DA is the most widely used probe for detecting intraellular oxidative stress. To detect the production of ROS, it was dded into bacteria suspension in the concentration of 10 mM and ncubated in dark condition for 30 min after bacteria cultured with amples for 6 h. This suspension was collected and centrifuged o harvest bacteria, then the same volume of PBS was added into\nacteria pellets. The fluorescent intensity of this new solution\nas determined by a microplate reader in fluorescent mode with\nxcitation at 488 nm and emission at 525 nm.\n.12. Measurement of Cu and Ag uptake\nAfter cultured with samples in LB medium at pH 5.0 for 6 h, 100-μL aliquot of bacteria suspension was spread on agar plates or bacteria counting while the rest of it was washed in EDTA olution (1 mM) followed by three-times washing in DI water. hen bacteria were harvested and digested in HNO 3 solution (GR,\neijing Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China) overnight before kept at\n0 °C for 30 min. Then they were diluted with DI water and anayzed by ICP-MS to determine the concentration of metal ions. The mount of metal ions was normalized to the number of bacteria.\n.13. Cell culture\nThe adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSC) and uman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used and\nultured in α-minimum essential medium ( α-MEM) and endotheial cell medium (ECM), respectively. Both cells were used at the\nassages of 3 to 5 in this study, and Ad-MSC were seeded at he density of 20,0 0 0 cells/cm 2 while HUVEC were seeded at the ensity of 40,0 0 0 cells/cm 2 . For osteogenic assays, a cocktail of\n-MEM with osteogenic factors (dexamethasone, ascorbic acid nd β-glycerophosphate) was used while the 1:1 mixture of -MEM and ECM were used for coculture system. In addition, all EEK samples were sterilized by UV light with half hour for each ide.\n.14. Adhesion and proliferation of Ad-MSC and HUVEC\nCells were seeded on samples in a 24-plate for 12 h before xed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde at 4 °C overnight. After ehydrating in graded ethanol, samples were coated with gold by mall ion sputtering device (KYKY, China, SBC-12). Then samples\nere observed under SEM to analyze cell adhesion morphology.\no evaluate cell proliferation, samples incubated with Ad-MSC for\n, 3 and 5 d or incubated with HUVEC for 1 and 3 d, then the ulture medium with 10% of MTT (Beyotime, China) was added nd incubated at 37 °C at each time point. 4 h later, the medium as replaced by the same volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), nd the absorbance of this solution was read at 570 nm through a\nicroplate reader.\n.15. Angiogenic and osteogenic differentiation of monocultured and ocultured cells\nThe angiogenic differentiation performance of HUVEC was stimated by the production of NO. The griess reagent system Promega, USA) was utilized to quantify the release of NO after\nUVEC cultured with samples for 24 h. In brief, cells were lysed, nd 50 μL of lysed cell solution was incubated with the reagent ill a purple/magenta color appeared. Its absorbance was measured\nithin 30 min in a plate reader at 520 nm, and the amount of NO as calculated based on the prepared standard curve constructed ith sodium nitrate.\nFor the osteogenic differentiation assessment of Ad-MSC, they ere seeded on samples for monoculture or seeded with HUVEC\nn samples for coculture. After incubation for 7 d, BCIP/NBT lkaline phosphatase color development kit (Beyotime, China) and lkaline phosphatase assay kit (Beyotime, China) were used to haracterize the qualitative and quantitative of alkaline phosphate ALP) expression, respectively. After 14 d, collagen expression was ualitatively imaged after samples stained with 0.1% solution of irius Red (Sigma, USA) in saturated picric acid, then samples were estained by destaining solution (0.2 M NaOH/methanol 1:1) and heir absorbances were measured with a microplate reader at 570 m. The extracellular matrix (ECM) mineralization was evaluated fter 21 days’ incubation. Specifically, qualitative analysis was caried out by staining with Alizarin Red S (ARS, Sigma; 2%, pH = 4.3) t 4 °C, and quantitative analysis was performed by measuring the bsorbance of calcium dissolving solution (10% cetylpyridinium hloride).\n.16. Gene expression analysis\nThe expression of osteo-related genes were analyzed by the eal-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTCR). After incubated with samples for 7 and 14 days, Ad-MSC ellets were lysed with TRIzol reagent (TIANGEN BIOTECH, China) o collect RNA pellets and they were converted to cDNA using a evertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher, USA). ubsequently, the produced cDNA was amplified by an ABI 7500 T-PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, USA), and primers (5 ′ -3 ′ ) sed in this study are listed in Table S1. The relative mRNA exression level of each gene was normalized with the housekeeping ene18S rRNA and determined by the cycle threshold (Ct) value ccording to the Ct method.\n.17. Animal model\nThe bone repairing ability of samples was assessed in a tibia odel in adult New Zealand white rabbit. This animal surgery as authorized by Ethics Committee of Peking University Health\ncience Center, and the surgical procedures were performed in ccordance with Experimental Animal Ethics Branch (LA2019019). ix 3-month-old New Zealand Rabbits were randomly assigned o PEEK, SP-CuO, and SP-CuO/Ag groups. After anesthesia with entobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg, intravenous injection), three oles (2-mm in diameter, 6 mm in depth) were drilled in the eft and right tibia of rabbits, then samples were placed into he defects. The wound was closed with sutures in layers. Afer the operation, the rabbits were housed in separate cages in\ns w s w\nP b r u r o s p t e f o h p 5 o f a r r w p c ( c w r a m p r b m a c a a m s β t t c o C u r c s o o a\n3\na i b s s\nan environmentally-controlled animal-care laboratory. Rabbits were sacrificed after 6 and 12 weeks, and their tibias were collected and fixed in 10% neutral formalin buffer for 24 h at room temperature.\n2.18. Micro computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis\nMicro-CT (Inveon MM CT; Siemens, Germany) was applied to analysis the newly formed bone around implants, and it was performed at 80 kV. After scanning, the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) models were reconstructed using Inveon Research Workplace software (Siemens, Germany), and the bone mineral density (BMD) and bone volume over total volume (BV/TV) were determined at the same time.\n2.19. Histological evaluation\nAfter fixation in 10% neutral formalin buffer, the tibias were rinsed in DI water before dehydrated in graded ethanol, then embedded in methylmethacrylate. Afterward, the embedded samples were cut along its vertical axis into sections with a thickness of 200 μm, followed by grinding into thickness of 20 μm. Two sections were made for each specimen. One section was observed using SEM, the other section was stained with methylene blue and acid fuchsine and captured by optical microscope.\n2.20. Statistically analysis\nAt least three samples were used for each data point, and the results were presented as mean ± standard deviations. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to measure the statistically significant difference ( p ) among groups, and p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Preparation and characterization of implant coating\nTo achieve rapid osseointegration of implant even in the face of bacterial infection, a well-designed coating was constructed on the surface of PEEK ( Fig. 1 ). A three dimensional (3D) porous structure appeared on the surface of PEEK after sulfuric acid treatment and most of these pores were between 1.0 and 3.0 μm in diameter ( Fig. 2 a), which is beneficial to bone regeneration and implant stability [10 , 23] . Then pre-produced μCuO and μCuO/nAg were incorporated onto this porous surface under the assistance of silk fibroin, these incorporated microparticles were scattered on this surface and coated by silk fibroin. The μCuO exhibited a flower-like porous structure with a wide range of diameter from 0.5 to 4 μm, and they are composed of thin nanosheets protruding from the core (Fig. S1a). This flower like structure contains higher surface area, and it contributes to high loading capacity of silver nanoparticles (nAg). Thus, nAg were in situ grown from porous μCuO via PDA. The resulted particles showed the existence of nanoparticles on their surface (Fig. S1b, d), and these nanoparticles were analyzed by EDS and were identified to be silver nanoparticles (Fig. S1c), verified the successful upload of nAg. On the other hand, the successful deposition of PDA and silk fibroin was confirmed by XPS analysis ( Fig. 2 c). The appearance of C-N group on the high resolution C 1s spectra of SP-PDA samples indicates the successful deposition of polydopamine ( Fig. 2 c 3 ). Meanwhile, the increased concentration of nitrogen element, from 2.79% to 6.15% ( Fig. 2 d), can ascribe to the higher content of nitrogen element in polydopamine, which further reveals the existence of polydopamine. On the other hand, the higher concentration of nitrogen element in CuO/Ag coating coincides with the rich nitrogen characteristic of\nilk fibroin, verifying the existence of silk fibroin. However, there\nere no peaks of silver and copper, which may ascribe to the hielding effect of silk fibroin. Collectively, this designed coating\nas successfully constructed on the surface of PEEK.\nThe incorporated μCuO/nAg were anchored on the surface of EEK via silk fibroin, they can only exert influences to cells and acteria through the release of metal ions. Thus, a pH-responsive elease behavior was designed to this coating in order to avoid nnecessary premature elution of metal ions, which is able to elief the concern about silver toxicity and inhibit the emergence f bacterial resistance. This characteristic was tested by immersing amples into solution with different pH values for varying time eriod. The released copper and silver ions were measured and heir release profiles were displayed in Fig. 3 a, c. At physiological nvironment (pH 7.4), the lowest amount of metal ions leaked rom CuO/Ag coating for both Cu 2 + and Ag + . With the decrease f pH value, the release amount of metal ions increased, and the\nighest amount of metal ions were eluted from SP-CuO/Ag samles at the lowest pH value (5.0), which were 40 μg for Cu 2 + and μg for Ag + . To further verify the pH-controlled release ability f this coating, samples were kept at physiological environment or 7 days first, and then immersed into solution with pH 5.0 for nother 7 days. The CuO/Ag coating displayed a slow and steady elease behavior for both Cu 2 + and Ag + at pH 7.4, and the release ate dramatically increased once samples were exposed to solution\nith pH 5.0 ( Fig. 3 b, d). Taking together, it is evidently that a\nH-responsive release ability was successfully endowed to this oating. This can attribute to the unique properties of silk fibroin Fig. 3 e). It consists of heavy (H) and light (L)-chain. The H-chain ontains hydrophobic repetitive parts, N-terminus, and C-terminus\nith different isoelectric points (p I ), which are 3.8, 4.6 and 10.5, espectively [24] . This feature endows silk fibroin with electronegtivity at physiological pH (7.4), thus attracting positively charged\netal ions through electrostatic interaction. When environment\nH decreases, the protonation degree of silk fibroin is enhanced, educing the amount of negative charge. This causes imbalance etween negative and positive charge, inducing the release of\netal ions. On the other hand, pH-induced conformation change lso can affect the release of metal ions. Silk fibroin is an extended onformation at pH 7.4 because of the repulsive interactions mong its negatively charged backbones [24] . Thus silk fibroin is ble to expose its negatively charged groups to positively charged\netal ions. However, the decrease of pH will mitigate the repulive interactions and facilitate the transition from random coil to\n-sheet structure, which is tighter and more compact. This leads o fewer negatively charged groups getting exposed, resulting in he release of metal ions. In addition, the decrease of pH also an promote the release of metal ions because of the accelerated xygen dependent dissolution of metal ions from particles [25] . ollectively, these factors assure the slow release of Cu 2 + and Ag + nder physiological environment and the faster and larger amount elease of metal ions under lower pH environment. Thus, this oating could inhibit unnecessary premature elution of metal ions o as to alleviate the toxicity of Ag + and impede the emergence f bacterial resistance. Meanwhile, a fast and large amount release f metal ions can be achieved at when and where bacteria appear, s bacterial metabolism acidifies their local environment.\n.2. In Vitro Antibacterial Evaluation\nAs implant-associated infections are the result of bacteria dhesion to an implant and subsequent biofilm formation at the mplantation site [26] , the antibacterial abilities were evaluated\ny short-term antibacterial test and long-term anti-biofilm asessment. Fig. 4 a showed the activities of bacteria adhered on ample, which were lowest in SP-CuO/Ag group at both pH 7.4\nT b r r w e i o l o b i s p i b a r i a e t e b s a and 5.0. Meanwhile, the SEM images demonstrated the same results. Fig. 4 i displayed that compared with PEEK and SP-CuO samples, much fewer bacteria inhabited on the surface of SPCuO/Ag sample when cultured at pH 7.4, and no bacteria dwelled onto SP-CuO/Ag sample when cultured at pH 5.0. These results indicated SP-CuO/Ag sample possesses the strongest anti-bacterial adhesion ability, which can hinder the formation of biofilm. However, the suspending bacteria may adhere to neighbor tissue and form biofilm, which is remarkably resistant to both the immune response and systemic antibiotic therapies [27] , leading to osteomyelitis that is notoriously difficult-to-treat with treatment failure rates up to 20–30% [11] . Therefore, it appears necessary for implants to kill planktonic bacteria to block any pathways of biofilm forming. The number of viable bacteria in the suspension was lowest in SP-CuO/Ag group, whereas its antibacterial rate was the highest ( Fig. 4 b, c), indicating the stronger bacteria-killing ability of SP-CuO/Ag samples compare with SP-CuO and PEEK samples. What’s noteworthy, when bacterial incubated with SP-CuO/Ag samples at pH 5.0, the number of viable bacteria reached the bottom that was 1.4 × 10 4 CFU, 10 4 fold lower than that cultured at pH 7.4 ( Fig. 4 c). Consistently, the antibacterial rate under lower pH condition (pH = 5.0) was higher than that under physiological environment. For SP-CuO/Ag group, the antibacterial rates at pH 5.0 and 7.4 were 99.99% and 75.62%, respectively. These results can be ascribed to the direct and indirect effects of pH variation. he variation of pH can indirectly influence the growth of bacteria y affecting the release of metal ions, thus stimulating the pHesponsive bactericidal effect of samples. Fig. 3 displayed that the elease amount of both Cu 2 + and Ag + were increased significantly ith the decrease of pH value, thus leading to stronger bactericidal ffect. On the other hand, the change of pH value could directly nhibit bacterial growth. As displayed in Fig. 4 a, c, the number f both adherent and planktonic bacteria in PEEK group was a ittle bit lower at pH 5.0 than that at pH 7.4. Actually, the chosen f E. coli as experimental bacteria to evaluate the pH-responsive actericidal effect of samples was based on the fact that E. coli s more resistant to external pH variation than S. aureus [28 , 29] , o as to minimize the effect of pH variation on bacteria-killing erformance. The results showed that the direct bacterial growth nhibition effect of pH variation was significantly smaller than the acteria-killing ability of SP-CuO/Ag sample at pH 5.0, as pH varition in PEEK group reduced 40.74% of bacterial but led to 99.99% eduction of bacteria number in SP-CuO/Ag group. Taken together, t shows that SP-CuO/Ag sample possesses effective pH-responsive ntibacterial ability. As the existence of bacteria acidifies their local nvironment [30] , it is fair to say a CuO/Ag coating with bacteriariggered self-defensive ability was constructed. This coating could radicate the inhabitation of bacteria and kill 99.99% of planktonic acteria immediately after bacteria acidify their local environment, o as to avoid the formation of biofilm. To further verify the nti-biofilm capacity, bacteria were cultured with samples for\ng F i i w t o ( f d c d o i p c l a a e o e s s t c o e t a F h S a P r 7 days. Fig. 4 j displayed that a biofilm was formed on the surface of PEEK sample and lots of bacteria resided upon SP-CuO sample, while only a few bacteria scattered upon SP-CuO/Ag sample with distorted or even broken shape. The magnified images further demonstrated the damaged morphologies of bacteria. Fig. 4 k 1 presented the distorted morphology of bacteria that adhered on SPCuO sample while Fig. 4 k 2 clearly exhibited the broken membrane of bacteria that adhered on SP-CuO/Ag sample. This proved the extraordinary effect of SP-CuO/Ag samples against bacterial infection, which can guarantee the victory of host cells in the “race to the surface” [31] . It’s noticeable that SP-CuO/Ag sample killed 99.99% of bacteria. The difference in antibacterial ability between SP-CuO group and SP-CuO/Ag group indicated that the combination of copper and silver should be able to enhance bacteria-killing capability. Copper and silver were reported to kill bacteria through different pathways. Specifically, copper can impair bacterial membrane functions through lipid peroxidation, while silver will coordinate with particular sites of membrane leading to compromised integrity of bacterial membrane or disruption of bacterial electron transport chain activity [32 –34] . Also, both of them can increase intracellular ROS but copper tends to elevate the production of ROS through catalyzing Fenton chemistry and hydroxyl radical formation, while silver mainly depletes antioxidant reserves thus resulting in increased intracellular ROS [35 –37] . As to the dysfunction of protein, copper can oxidase the amino acid side chain in protein causing inactivity, while silver can displace with metal ions leading to inhibition of protein activity [38 , 39] . Therefore, we postulated that the combination of copper and silver would exhibit synergistic antibacterial capability, which could result in severer disruption of membrane/protein and enhanced accumulation of intracellular ROS. To verify these hypotheses, the membrane integrity was monitored through direct and indirect assays, and the intracellular ROS level was measured. As depicted in Fig. 4 d, the SP-CuO/Ag group possessed higher PI intensity than SP-CuO group, directly indicates more serious damage to bacterial membrane in SP-CuO/Ag roup. Meanwhile, indirect assays further confirmed this result. ig. 4 e demonstrated that much higher protein leakage appeared n SP-CuO/Ag group rather than SP-CuO group, while much higher ntracellular copper and silver concentration in SP-CuO/Ag group as illustrated in Fig. 4 g, h. As to the intracellular ROS level, he combination of copper and silver imposed significant effect n it, elevating the intracellular ROS level by thousands of times Fig. 4 f). These results perfectly validated our hypothesis and rom which a more detailed bacteria-killing mechanism could be educed ( Fig. 5 ). Taken these results together, we reason that the ombination of copper and silver could cause severer membrane isruption than copper alone, which can lead to a higher amount f protein leakage and a higher concentration of intracellular metal ons. Boosted intracellular accumulation of ROS and more serious rotein dysfunction would happen because of the elevated conentration of intracellular metal ions. These together would finally ead to stronger antibacterial ability. In addition, the antibacterial bility of SP-CuO/Ag sample against E. coli can be applied to S. ureus - more prevalent source of implant infection. To some xtent, the thick wall of S. aureus would undermine the ability f copper and silver to get inside bacteria, but that would not xert significant influence on the antibacterial ability of SP-CuO/Ag ample to E. coli and S. aureus . Because copper and silver can detroy the membrane structure of S. aureus through silver binding o thiol-group of the membrane and lipid peroxidation elicited by opper [32 , 40 , 41] . Besides that, they also can kill bacteria through ther different pathways, i.e.: ROS production, protein dysfunction, nzyme inactivation, and DNA damage, all of which are applicable o different bacteria, including S. aureus . The results of SP-CuO/Ag gainst S. aureus further proved these statements. As depicted in ig. S2, after cultured with S. aureus in medium at pH 7.4 for 24 , SP-CuO/Ag sample killed 99.99% of planktonic S. aureus . Besides, P-CuO/Ag sample significantly inhibited the adhesion of S. aureus s the number of S. aureus adhered on SP-CuO/Ag sample and EEK sample were around 600 CFU/cm 2 and 3.7 × 10 7 CFU/cm 2 , espectively.\n3\nm m S e s t ( c p t t f A i o i s s q p ( b a i\nd n d i r a D m d b o c g t g t o C 7 p g d\nt c v t o d g p r c C e A a a\nt T a a C o\n3\nt p s p o H o c w r s m d p o E i N t\nm c p e f d s ( g ( i r a a\n3\np o t t s t h l s l t a o g W a\n.3. Adhesion, proliferation, and osteodifferentiation of Ad-MSC\nCell adhesion and proliferation were assessed as it is fundaental of osseointegration [42] . SEM was used to observe the orphology of cells. After cultured for 12 h, cells adhered upon P-CuO and SP-CuO/Ag samples displayed a polygonal shape with xtended filopodia to sense the substrate while cells on PEEK urface exhibited more spreading morphology ( Fig. 6 a). However, he proliferation of cells showed best results on SP-CuO sample Fig. 6 b), revealing facilitated cell proliferation by the incorporated opper. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference about cell roliferation between SP-CuO and SP-CuO/Ag samples, indicating he existence of silver did not impose toxicity to cell proliferaion. Apart from that, the combination of copper and silver even acilitated the osteogenesis of cells compare with CuO coating.\nfter cultivation for 7 d, ALP activity, which plays a major role\nn bone mineralization and serve as a phenotypic marker for\nsteoblast cells, was highest in SP-CuO/Ag group ( Fig. 6 d), and\nts staining images displayed the deepest blue color and largest taining area in SP-CuO/Ag group ( Fig. 6 c), which means the trongest expression of ALP in SP-CuO/Ag group. Consistently,\nualitative and quantitative of collagen secretion and calcium deosition highlighted the osteogenesis ability of SP-CuO/Ag sample Fig. 6 e, f, g, h). Largest staining area and deepest red color for oth Sirius red and ARS staining appeared on SP-CuO/Ag sample, nd the quantitative results were in accordance with the staining mages.\nTo further investigate the osteodifferentiation of Ad-MSC on ifferent sam ples, the expression of some osteo-specific markers eed to be measured as cells tend to express various biomarkers in ifferent stages of differentiation. Generally, there are three stages\nn the osteodifferentiation of MSC: proliferation, matrix matuation, and matrix mineralization [43] . Accelerated cell growth nd enhanced ALP expression happened during the first stage.\nuring the second stage, the secretion of collagen type I (COL I) atrix, which is the major component of extracellular matrix and ominate protein source of the organic part of bone [44] , would e heightened. The third stage is featured by facilitated production f the extracellular protein, OCN, and subsequent deposition of alcium phosphate mineral [45] . Therefore, the expression level of enes that encoding ALP, COL I, and osteocalcin (OCN) were quanitated by RT-PCR ( Fig. 6 i). The expression of ALP in SP-CuO/Ag roup was half of that in PEEK group at day 7, and was upregulate o be four-fold of that in PEEK group at day 14. The expression f COL I demonstrated the same pattern. Ad-MSC cultured on SPuO/Ag demonstrated the lowest level of COL I expression at day , which increased to be the highest at day 14. As to OCN, its exression level in SP-CuO/Ag group slightly fell behind that of PEEK roup at day 7, whereas it caught up and became the highest at ay 14.\nConcluded from these results, it is evidently that the combinaion of copper and silver could potentiate the osteogenesis of cells ompare with SP-CuO group, indicating that the incorporated siler could stimulate osteogenesis. Actually, many studies reported hat silver nanoparticles did facilitate osteogeneic differentiation f stem cells at an appropriate concentration [46 –48] . It was ocumented to account for the exposure of nAg to cells, trigering the upregulated expression of cbfa1 or mitogen-activated rotein kinase (MAPK) [49 , 50] , both of which are involved in the egulation of osteoblast differentiation. In addition, the effect of opper on the enhanced osteodifferentiation cannot be ignored. opper has been proved to promote cell proliferation and differntiation at relative low concentration (0.1 mM/6.4 μg/mL) [51] .\nfter incubated at physiological environment for 28 d, the release mount of Cu 2 + from SP-CuO/Ag samples was only 0.85 μg/mL, nd it could be even lower when cultured with cells because of\np\nhe barrier effect of extracellular matrix secreted by cells [48] . his low concentration of Cu 2 + will not exert adverse effect to cell ctivities and conversely would be beneficial to cell proliferation nd osteodifferentiation. Together, these solidly support that the uO/Ag coated PEEK sample can elevate cell proliferation and steogenesis.\n.4. Adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of HUVEC\nIt has been reported that accelerated angiogenesis can lead o earlier osseointegration through the delivery of osteogenic recursors to, and direct formation of bone on, the implant urface [20] . Therefore, the angiogenesis performances of samles were evaluated. SEM was applied to observe the adhesion f cells ( Fig. 7 a). It showed that a relatively spherical shape of\nUVEC appeared on the surface of PEEK, and the cells adhere n SP-CuO sample became somehow elongated. Meanwhile, the ounterparts on SP-CuO/Ag sample manifested flat morphology\nith lamellipodia stretching out to sense the substrate. These esults together disclose the preference of HUVEC to SP-CuO/Ag ample. The following proliferation activity was evaluated by MTT\nethod. The PEEK sample exhibited the highest cell activity at\nay 1, whereas both SP-CuO and SP-CuO/Ag groups caught up and resented superior cell activity at day 3 ( Fig. 7 b). The production f NO, a mediator of angiogenesis, was measured as it can drive Cs differentiate towards mature blood vessels [52] . As depicted\nn Fig. 7 c, there was no significant difference in the production of\nO between SP-CuO/Ag group and SP-CuO group, which was more\nhan twice as much as that of the PEEK group.\nGiven these findings, the employment of silver did not underine the angiogenesis potential of HUVEC, and the utilization of opper did favor the angiogenesis of HUVEC. In fact, it was reorted that copper can induce angiogenesis through activating an xtracellular target (perhaps pro-angiogenic cytokine) [53] . Apart rom that, copper was believed to elicit angiogenesis through en-\nocellular pathway. Specifically, copper can strengthen the hypoxia timulus by stabilizing the structure of hypoxia inducible factor-1 α HIF-1 α), in turn inducing the transcription of vascular endothelial rowth factor (VEGF), activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase eNOS), and increasing the release of NO [21 , 54] , eventually leadng to angiogenesis. Taken together, thanks to the controlled slow elease of metal ions, the CuO/Ag coating will not attenuate the ngiogenesis potential of HUVEC in spite of the existence of nAg nd conversely promote the angiogenesis of HUVEC.\n.5. Osteogenesis of Ad-MSC when cocultured with HUVEC\nTo more closely represent the real environment of bone healing rocess, Ad-MSC and HUVEC were cocultured on samples and the steogenesis performance were determined. In this coculture sysem, SP-CuO/Ag samples exhibited the highest capacity to promote he osteodifferentiation of cells, followed by SP-CuO and PEEK amples. What’s notably, the coculture system per se, which allows he complete crosstalk between Ad-MSC and HUVEC, profoundly eightened the osteogenic activity of cells, whereas abolished their ater mineralization. In detail, the staining images of ALP expresion and collagen secretion in coculture system presented much arger stain area with deeper color in comparison to the monoculure of Ad-MSC ( Fig. 6 c, e). Consistently, after incubated for 7 days nd 14 days, the quantitative results manifested a 20-fold increase\nf ALP activity and a 3-fold increase of collagen secretion in all roups of coculture compared with that of monoculture ( Fig. 6 d, f).\nhat’s surprisingly, there was no calcium deposition on samples\nt all after cells cocultured for 21 days (data not shown).\nThese results seems contradictory, but they can be well exlained. The facilitated osteogenic performance in coculture system\nw a t r i f p b p t b V s\nr t s\n3\ns t a w p w p i b 3 a\nq t a t c C ( o t m S r l a t t A i b w b o m A f i a t i i t c as believed to be originated from the direct cell-cell interaction nd paracrine effects between Ad-MSC and HUVEC. It was reported hat the expression of VEGF by MSC can somehow activate ECs and esult in the significant up-regulation of BMP-2 and NO expression n ECs, which subsequently induce strengthened osteogenic diferentiation of MSC [55] . Also, Ren et al believed that osteoblasts roduce high level of slit homolog 3 protein (SLIT3), increasing one formation by acting indirectly as an angiogenic factor to romote the growth of a subtype of vascular endothelium [56] . On he other hand, the inhibitory effect on calcium deposition should e imputed to the suppression of osterix (OSX) expression by HUEC, therefore arresting MSC differentiation at a pre-osteoblastic tage, avoiding mineral deposition within vessels [57] . Taken together, it is undoubtedly that SP-CuO/Ag samples emain their ability to potentiate osteogenesis in coculture sysem, thus it is reasonable to expect that SP-CuO/Ag implant can timulate the bone formation and lead to osseointegration in vivo . .6. In vivo studies Considering the in vitro performances of CuO/Ag coated amples, which potentiated osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and anibacterial ability, it was expected to facilitate new bone formation nd osseointegration in vivo . An established rabbit tibia model as used to examine the bone formation and osseointegration erformances of implants with constructed coatings. Micro-CT as employed to evaluate the new bone formation around imlants through the observation of 3D remodeling images and axial mages of all groups. The formation of new bone was indicated y red arrows in axial images and it is clearly to conclude from D remodeling images that highest volume of new bone formed round SP-CuO/Ag implant at both 6 and 12 weeks ( Fig. 8 a). The uantitative results were consistent with that, which showed that he bone volume fraction (BV/TV) was highest in SP-CuO/Ag group nd compromised in SP-CuO group but still slightly higher than hat of PEEK group at both 6 and 12 weeks ( Fig. 8 b). Additionally, ompared with PEEK group, the BMD also was increased by SPuO implant, and it was further heightened by SP-CuO/Ag implant Fig. 8 c). Clearly, SP-CuO/Ag implant exerted more positive effect n new bone formation than PEEK and SP-CuO implants did. As o the integration between bone and implants, it was evaluated by ethylene blue and acid fuchsine staining of hard tissue slices and EM observation of hard tissue slices. According to the staining esults ( Fig. 9 ), after implantation for 6 weeks, there was a thick ayer of fibrous connective tissue surrounding the PEEK implant nd separating it from bone tissue, whereas the fibrous connective issue around the SP-CuO implant was narrowed and that around he SP-CuO/Ag implant became discontinuous and much thinner. fter implantation for 12 weeks, the fibrous tissue between PEEK mplant and bone tissue was narrowed and replaced by new one. Surprisingly, the fibrous tissue around SP-CuO/Ag implants as completely replaced by newly formed bone, and some new one appeared inside some of the pore structure, indicating the sseointegration of SP-CuO/Ag implant. The SEM and elemental apping images of hard tissue slices corroborated that results. s displayed in Fig. S3, after implantation for 6 weeks, a layer ull of carbon, which is fibrous connective tissue, separated PEEK mplant from bone tissue. However, this layer around SP-CuO nd SP-CuO/Ag implants were narrowed. At 12-week time point, his layer around PEEK implant reduced into a small gap, and t disappeared for SP-CuO/Ag implant. Furthermore, the optical mages of stained hard tissue slices can be used to evaluate the ribological characterization of surface coating, as implants will onfront the mechanical stresses that come from body movements\ni c r w S s t\ni m b c a c n b r e b o f a\n4\no i l C w 5 s b b t c\nD\nt d t\nD\nc t\nA\nK 2 (\nS\nf\nR\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\nn animal study. As displayed in Fig. 9 , the morphologies of surface oatings were clear, and the coatings of SP-CuO/Ag implants were elatively integrated after implanted into rabbits’ tibia for 6 and 12\neeks. Moreover, there was no sign of coating peeling off from the\nP-CuO/Ag implant even after implanted for 12 weeks. These reults indicated coatings on SP-CuO/Ag implants are strong enough o resist mechanical stresses that come from animal movements.\nTaken together, the coating constructed on SP-CuO/Ag implant s strong enough to resist mechanical stresses come from animal\novements, thus it can perform its bio-functions during the entire\none healing process. Moreover, SP-CuO/Ag implant is the best hoice to achieve rapid osseointegration in comparison with PEEK nd SP-CuO implants. It partly stems from the incorporation of opper as which possesses inherent significant bone regeneration ature [11] . The combination of silver also can accelerate new one formation and osseointegration through cellular behavior egulation which was elaborated previously. Moreover, Ruizhong t al stated that silver nanoparticles can stimulate fracture healing y attracting MSC, eliciting proliferation of MSC, and inducing steogenic differentiation of MSC [50] . Hence, it is expectable or SP-CuO/Ag implant to become a successful implant that can chieve rapid osseointegration.\n. Conclusion\nIn this study, a pH-response coating with controlled release f copper and silver was constructed upon porous PEEK surface\nn order to achieve bone defect repair. The in vitro studies highighted the osteogenic and angiogenic abilities of the silk-based\nuO/Ag coatings, and its bacteria-triggered antibacterial capacity as stressed as the number of viable bacteria in medium with pH .0 was 10 4 fold lower than that in medium with pH 7.4. In vivo tudies showed higher volume of new bone around, and better one-implant integration of, the CuO/Ag coated implant. These enefit the success of bone defect repair after the implantation of he CuO/Ag functionalized implant, leading it to be a promising oating in the future clinic application.\nata availability statement\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in his article or supplementary information files.

    "abstractText" : "Polyetheretherketone has been widely used for bone defect repair, whereas failures may happen due to implant loosening and infection. Thus, PEEK implant with multi-function (osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and bacteria-killing) is essential to solve this problem. Herein, copper oxide microspheres (μCuO) decorated with silver nanoparticles (nAg) were constructed on porous PEEK surface via silk fibroin. In vitro studies highlighted the pH controlled release ability of this coating. It liberated a high dose of Cu 2 + and Ag + at low pH environment (pH 5.0), leading to 99.99% killing of planktonic bacteria and complete eradication of sessile bacteria, avoiding biofilm formation. Under physiological environment (pH 7.4), a lower amount of leaked metal ions induced promoted ALP production, collagen secretion, and calcium deposition, as well as NO production, which indicated potentiated osteogenesis and angiogenesis. In vivo results displayed the highest new bone volume around, and the appearance of new bone inside porous structure of, PEEK implant with this coating in rabbit tibia, signified the abilities of this coating to promote bone regeneration and osseointegration. Our study established solid support for implants with this coating to be a successful bone defect repair solution. Statement of Significance In this study, CuO/Ag micro/nano particles were incorporated into the porous surface of PEEK through polydopamine and silk fibroin layers. The design of this coating conferred pH-controlled release behavior to Cu 2 + and Ag + . High dose of metal ions were released at pH 5.0, which presented synergistic antibacterial ability and killed 99.99% of planktonic bacteria. Low concentration of metal ions were controlled by this coating at physiological environment, which potentiated osteodifferentiation of Ad-MSC in vitro and led to complete integration of implant with bone tissue in vivo . © 2020 Acta Materialia Inc.
