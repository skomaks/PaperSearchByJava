Considering adsorbent and photocatalytic materials as the main reliable candidates still are encountering with struggles because of many challenges that restrict their large-scale application. This review comprehensively considered the recent advanced materials water treatment methods which involve to magnetic, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene (G), graphene oxide (GO), (Graphene) quantum dots, carbon nanorods, carbon nano-onions, and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), zeolite, silica and clay-based nanomaterials. The adsorption and photocatalytic properties of these nanomaterials introduced them as highly potent option for heavy metal ions and organic dyes removal and photocatalytic degradation. High specific surface area in conjugation with presenting higher kinetics of adsorption and decomposition are the main characteristics of these materials which make them appropriate to treat wastewater even in ultralow concentration of the pollutants. Considering the mechanistic aspects of the adsorption and photocatalytic decomposition process, challenges and opportunities were other subjects that have been highlighted for the discussed nanomaterials. In term of the adsorption approaches, the mechanism of adsorptions and their influence on the maximum adsorption capacity were discussed and also for photocatalyst approach the radical active spices and their role in kinetic and efficiency of the organic pollutant decomposition were provided a deep discussion.\n© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

      "text" : "The paradigm shifts away from the bulky to the nanomaterials in recent decades, which has been caused to the great advancements of nanotechnology in developing of nanomaterials which with their nanoscale sizes have opened a new horizon to their many industrial and environmental applications such as water treatment and pollutants removal. Researches attention toward the nanotechnology originated from the many physicochemical properties of the materials which could not be obtained from the bulk phase, and this issue makes many advantages to their usage in many fields of sciences especially in dye and heavy metal ions removal [1e5]. Unfortunately, plethora of reports that prove their\nna).\ndangerous effects on human health and their control still remained as a challenge especially few diseases directly relate to the water sources. Many studies showed that, dye pollutants significantly enhance the risk of esthetic aspects of the water sources which potentially compromise the aquatics and plants ecosystems [6,7]. Moreover, the human society encounters and also struggles with massive volume of the pollutants that threat environment and many ecosystems. Elimination of the biofouling film on various marine surfaces remains as a challenge because of high cost of the antifouling conventional coating materials [8,9]. Recent major concerns concentrated on the facts that how we can solve the environment pollutants using nanomaterials with taking into account the safety issues. Basically, the pollutants penetration in freshwater sources could be as an environmental challenge that many expensive conventional protocols should be carried out for their eliminations. High cost, disability of the conventional refining methods in removal of the heavy metals, elimination of biofouling,\nand dye-based pollutants are the main problems which seem struggling, and it needs to be solved these challenges urgently. Therefore, developing a green approach that solves the potential toxicity of nanomaterial and also eliminates the pollutants have been as an interesting field which attracted a lot of attentions of researchers in all over of the world because the green nanomaterials with numerous benefits not only are more efficient (in that the conventional methods do not) but also implementation of the green and available sources, good stability, low final cost of the refining, and and so on could replace previous expensive/lowefficient old methods [10,11]. Principally, green sources of the nanomaterials (e. g. natural locust bean gum-based hydrogels) with adsorption and photocatalytic properties make them safer and their methods of preparation in the most cases are easy [12e14]. Many experimental results, showed the effect of the dispersion degree of nanomaterials in their toxicity. For these reasons, in recent years, many efforts have been carried out for synthesis and developing the solid safe nanomaterials [15]. In this approach, researchers have tried to overcome to the agglomeration issue and degree of dispersion as parameters which control their physiochemical properties and especially their cytotoxicity. The separation of the nanomaterials after refining process of the pollutants from the clean phase, could be carried out by using various methods, but using a magnetic nanomaterial which supply the possibility of induced external control of separation after refining have been reported [16]. For instance, iron oxide nanomaterials and their derivatives which could be prepared bymicrowave ultrasonic, solvo/hydrothermal methods. In addition, many chemical synthesis processes can be used for preparing the nanomaterials such as solgel, reverse microemulsion, and coprecipitation [17,18]. The water treatment process is the main aims of the refining process which they suffer from the low efficiency, high energy and cost, and complicated process of treatment convince many researchers to develop nanomaterials-based treatment methods. Among mentioned methods, the precipitation process could be performed in large scalable method for removal of heavy metals, for example, chromium and so on. [19]. Recently, natural environment and ecosystem encounter with heavy metals and industrial dyes, and their toxic and harmful effects do not cover for anyone. The heavy metals which mainly consist on Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Hg, and Cr ions vastly detected in different kinds of water and soil sources that their presence thoroughly relate to many industrial activities of humankind [20e22]. The results of studies implicated that the dyes as other types of toxic materials which have extreme biotoxicity, carcinogenic andmutagenic effects, threating the life of many types of aquatics [22]. Therefore, the technology of absorbing or removal process of heavy metals and dyes not only is urgent but also changes the deplorable condition of many types of aquatic animals in water sources. Based on the recent literature, it has been discussed that magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) such as iron oxide and their derivatives have potential capability in removal and absorption of the heavy metals from the water sources which their ability about removal of the Pb, As, and other types of heavymetal ions are very hopeful and satisfactory [19]. Carbon nanomaterials are other types of adsorbents and photocatalysts which indicate high efficiency of water treatments because of high specific surface area and various morphologies. In despite of nanomaterials good ability in absorption process, low absorption capacity restricts their largescale applications. For instance, dissolution in acidic media for many years had been remained as an unsolved challenge but in recent years using many polymeric derivatives of the iron oxide nanoparticles which avoid their dissolution in acidic media and increase their absorption capacity because of increasing in specific surface area could eliminate this limitation. Because the high risk of desorption in adsorption approach, the photocatalytic approach\nhas been developed to overcoming this hurdle. So, the photodegradation process as one of the mechanisms for water source remediation recently attracted many attentions because of solving ability of desorption problems, higher reaction efficiency, low risk of toxicity, and high kinetics of photochemical reactions under visible irradiation. Therefore, this review discusses comprehensively the types of the nanomaterials and their interfacial modification effect on specific parameters that play a vital role in removal, absorption and degradation features, and focuses on their synthetic and modification methods. Different factors could affect the absorption and photodegradation mechanism, capacity and stability of these types of materials which should be mentioned to their optimum condition of absorption. Finally, the future prospective and conclusion which show the reliability of these types of materials were presented. Fig. 1 schematically represents the family of materials which have been discussed in this review."

      "text" : "2.1. Magnetic iron oxideebased nanoparticles\nAs a non-toxic, recyclable, reusable and easy-to-synthesis nanomaterials, the MNPs are pioneer in great physiochemical properties for absorption and removal of pollutants in which the easy separation after removal process using an external induced magnetic field make them unique in comparison with other types of nanomaterials [23,24]. MNPs recently have beenwidely used as a potential catalytic support material because of their magnetic behaviors which allows them to separate from the reaction batch without using any advance methods of the separation such as extractions centrifugation or filtration methods. For this reason, they could reduce the cost of the removal and catalytic process significantly and increase the efficiency of the process. Besides, there has been argued that the possibility of MNPs covalent binding interaction between their surface and catalysts is another plausible method. This issuewhich basically decrease theMNPs dispersibility in the reaction environments and could influence indirectly on the purity and efficacy of the reaction. In this regard, MNPs recently have been widely used as supports materials for organic materials synthesis [25]. In addition, with good controlling in MNPs and their surface modification and chemistry they have potential of usage as agents for bioimaging, delivery, therapy, and other biological and biomedical applications [23,26]. Metal oxide nanostructures are one of the most widely investigated MNPs. Metal oxide nanomaterial and nanostructures with semiconductor, insulator and metallic properties illustrated great potential of applications in vast types of electronic usage. Materials such as Fe2O3, MnO3, NiO2, Co3O4, and many broad types of magnetic materials characterization reported using easy and simple methods. Among them Fe2O3 and its derivatives (a-Fe2O3 and g-Fe2O3) have wide usage and are more common that other magnetic nanomaterials [27]. Fe3O4 types of materials with spinel, fcc, and hcp structure show the superparamagnetism properties [28,29]. Even more than this, the low cytotoxicity and biocompatibility make them as appropriate option for biological applications such as tissue engineering, therapy, and bioimaging applications [23,30e33]. The superparamagnetic properties of the Fe2O3 and its derivatives make it possible to develop a core-shell nanomaterial with unique capabilities. Hence Fe2O3 have been selected as core of the core-shell approaches, and the shell can be the arbitrary materials. Dar and Shivashankar [27] and Radu [34] et al. evaluated the temperature effect on the formation of Fe3O4, g-Fe2O3, and a-Fe2O3 nanoparticles through annealing method from 200 to 600 C. The single crystalline analysis and size of the particles from 30 to 65 nm have been proved for the particles using HRTEM images method. Two types of the\ncrystalline planes (222) and (311) were detected to the particles which were related to the crystal lattice sizes 2.4 and 2.5 Å. In addition, for g-Fe2O3, results showed the 4.8 Å and 2.5 Å were related to the (111) and (311) planes, respectively. For a-Fe2O3, the single plane (012) appeared in 3.6 Å crystal lattice. Magnetic behavior of the nanoparticles showed the ferrimagnetic properties with saturation magnetization equal to ~70 emu/g for all of the samples at 25 C. Their results indicated non-magnetic properties for hematite with saturation magnetization equal to ~0.9 emu/g at 25 C [27]. In accordance with recent reports, the saturation magnetization amount for ferrimagnetic Fe2O3 based on their crystal phase is 74.1 emu/g and 64.7 emu/g for magnetite and maghemite [35]. The magnetite was formed at 370 C for 30 min, whereas the maghemite could be formed at a temperature higher than 200 C [35]. And it should be noted that the hematite phase can form at temperature highre than 400 C (see Fig. 2).\nAdsorption of solute spices form the liquid phase is a technique that can be controlled by phase transfer process. The phase transfer process which depends on the enrichment of absorbate on the surface of a solid can be changed in various microenvironmental conditions. Many parameters can play a role in this process such as the solid surface wettability [36], the viscosity of the liquid phase, the net charge of the solid surface, the nature of the absorbate, the\nmechanism of the absorption, and so on [37]. Using solid-state absorbents with high absorption capacity have been as major challenge of the researches for removal of the heavy metals and dyes. In this context, many important parameters are that should be discussed by researchers which they directly influence on the mechanism of the absorption and subsequently the capacity of absorbent. Therefore, the physical and chemical absorption as two main and critical adsorption mechanisms influence on the removal mechanism and amount of heavymetal ions, dyes as absorbates are the core of this field which attracted much attentions. In chemical mechanism model, many types of strong interactions are being postulated which include the coordination interaction between absorbent and solute spices, chemical covalent, and acid-base bonding, whereas in physical approach, the electrostatic forces between absorbent and absorbate or other weak interaction such as Van der Waals interactions are the base of the separations [21]. Basically, although the nature of the heavy metal ions or dyes directly influences on the absorption capacity gradually, and the absorbent and their mechanism of absorption should be appropriately designed based on the absorbate physiochemical properties and provide the absorption optimum condition [38]. Adsorption process as a fundamental phenomenon plays a key role in removal process of pollutants because of their superior\nproperties to make a condition of absorption to obtain a low energy consumption, easy, and ability to scale-up progress. All of these parameters are related to the reversibility of the adsorbents to regeneration and reusing the process [20]. In this respect, the specific surface area plays a significant role because that controls the time of absorption and its kinetics to achieve adsorption equilibrium. Therefore, the capacity of absorption as one of the main factors should be calculated to the adsorbates. Based on several reports, there are many models of absorption which in proportion to the absorption condition could estimate the parameters of absorption. Among them, the Langmuir isotherm is one of the reliable and successful models generally has been used for calculating the capacity of adsorption and also the mechanism. Another model is the Freundlich isotherm that commonly has been used for gas absorption on the solid substrate, but many reports proved reliability of this model for the liquid phase under specific condition. In accordance with the Langmuir isotherm model, the absorption process is monolayer and the surface saturates after monolayer absorption process which comprised from first, pseudo first- or pseudo second-order of the absorption kinetic. Fundamentally, the kinetics of adsorption which considers the amount of adsorbate concentration during adsorption process in versus of\ntime and depends on many factors such as surface functional groups, wettability state, specific surface area, and so on that have been controlled by interaction between adsorbent and adsorbate. Although the monolayer adsorption could potentially restrict the maximum adsorption capacity, developing adsorbents which could remove the heavy metals and dyes in multilayer adsorption mechanism directly depends on isotherm of adsorption. Unfortunately, for many types of materials the adsorption occurs monolayer. The only condition for overcoming this hurdle is increasing the surface area of the adsorbent. On one hand, increasing in specific surface area could cause monolayer adsorption. On the other hand, because of the high amount of adsorption sites dyemolecules and heavy metals ions could adsorb without limitation in adsorption [39]. As mentioned previously, high porosity and specific surface area is one of the most important characteristics of the adsorbent materials which up to now many types of materials and composite have been reported with these properties. The reduced graphene oxide (RGO) [40], synthetic zeolite [41], and active carbon [42] are the groups of materials that can play as potent materials for adsorbent applications because of high specific surface area. Although, the mixture of these materials and MNPs can decrease the specific surface area of the composite, whereas for the\ncombination of materials such as clay and zeolites with low surface area MNPs would enhance that [40,42e47]. Therefore, considering the specific surface area after composition with magnetic particles is urgent and could reveal many points about the adsorption capacity [48e50]. The role of dispersion degree in specific surface area is irrevocable and recently in many reports, this issue has comprehensively been considered. For example, Mohebrad et al. [51] considered the specific surface area effect of the microbial electrochemical system of the whey cheese on protein removal efficiency. Up to now, vast range of the nanomaterials which composited with MNPs is used as substrates for removal of the blue dye. The activated montmorillonite [52], carbon [53e55], silica [56], rectorite [57], zeolite [58], graphene [59], graphene oxide (GO) [60,61], carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [62], and halloysite nanotubes [63] are the broad family of materials with high specific surface area, and the high capability of application in dyes and heavy metal ions removal. Mechanism of absorption on the zeolites is on the base of the ion exchange ability between solid surface and liquid phase. The superhydrophobic Fe2O3 nanorod is another magnetic option which could be used for oil wastes from the water sources removal [64]."

      "text" : "Zeolites are one of the highly porous materials which have great potential of application as adsorbent of many types of pollutants because of their capability in high absorption capacity and efficient treatments of pollutants. Generally, zeolites can be categorized to main synthetic and natural types which their application in water treatment have been reported so far. Based on many reports, natural zeolites (e. g. clinoptilolite) and synthetic types did not show similar behavior in absorption of heavy metals because of their difference in physiochemical properties such as their surface porosity, purity, and their chemical stability [65]. Meanwhile, for the zeolites which composited with Fe3O4 MNPs, the synthetic and natural types showed significant absorption [41,43,66]. The presence of the magnetic nanomaterials makes it possible that the cytotoxicity of these types of materials greatly have been decreased. Moreover, the biocompatibility is other property of these materials that makes them suitable for biological application [67]. The removal of the dye pollutants are the other applications of the zeolites and Fe2O3 MNPs composites which in accordance with the reports they have been tested to removal of the malachite green dye from the water media which is one of the most harmful type of the dye pollutants that its presence in water sources can cause too many carcinogenesis and other kind of the fractures in aquatics [68,69]. The recent study about the removal of malachite green dye showed the strong pH dependency (pH ¼ 8.0) of absorption. In this pH, the maximum absorption capacity was obtained that was equal to 13.8 mg/g at first dye concentration equal 80 mg/L, and in addition, the contact time between dye and adsorbent was estimated equal one hour at 6 C. It should be noted that, maximum adsorption from water medium on adsorbent after reaching to the equilibrium of adsorption and desorption. Typically, this unit defined as mg/g of adsorbate over nanomaterial as adsorbent. Usually, many factors such as specific surface area, wettability of the adsorbent, surface functional group, size of nanomaterials and their morphology are the associating things that play a role in the maximum amount of nanomaterial adsorption capacity. The results indicated that the process of adsorption not only is exothermic but also were carried out spontaneously which relate to the fly ash zeolitic structure [69]. Moreover, in another report, Jain et al. in communication to the fly ash absorption potential abilities\nstudied magnetic nanocomposites with fly ash [69] in 3:1 wt ratio. The composite saturation magnetization was analyzed which was equal to 19.9 emu g-1. This composition indicated the good capacity of absorption for heavy metal ions as Zn2þ<Cd2þ<Pb2þ. More study about the mechanism of adsorption revealed that the capacity of adsorption could be affected by ions electronegativity which for Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Zn2þ was equal with 2.33, 1.69, and 1.65, respectively. Another factor which plays a role in adsorption process is the ions radii which were 1.21, 0.97, and 0.74 Å for Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Zn2þ, respectively which could be interpreted by hard soft acid-base theory [69,70]. Pizarro et al. [49] in a study which considered the composition of nanomagnetite and zeolite reported high adsorption capacity for removal of arsenic ions. Their results indicated that amount of the adsorbed arsenic ions depends on average size of nanomagnetite (50 nm) which composited by natural zeolite. They noted that the monodentate and bidentate coordination binding between arsenic ions and Fe atoms not only cause high absorption capacity but also make the complex highly stable against desorption of the ions. In should be noted that the magneticinduced effect of the nanoparticles can be as other structural parameter that can help to high adsorption capacity [49]. These types of the magnetic zeolite composites were considered by Yuan et al. [71] to removing the Pb2þ ions through 120 min were obtained for the contact time and adsorption process to achieve the equilibrium. The capacity of adsorption was determined equal to 196.8 mg/g under the condition that Fe3O4 particles had 5% of the zeolitic adsorbent. The surface optimum physiochemical properties can play a significant role in Pb2þ adsorption process which have been considered by magnetic composition of chitosan/clinoptilolite zeolite [72]. Among many parameters, pH, temperature, concentration of adsorbate, and adsorbent are the main parameters that should be optimized for obtaining maximum adsorption. For chitosan/clinoptilolite magnetic nanocomposite, the optimum of these parameters were 4.0e6.0 20 C-60 C, 10e90 mg/L 0.2e1.0 g/L, respectively. The maximum amount for adsorption capacity of Pb2þ on chitosan/ clinoptilolite magnetic nanocomposite was 124.955 mg/g which was obtained at 5.49, 60 C, 89.08 mg/L of adsorbate, 0.48 g/L of adsorbent, respectively. Many reports indicated the presence of the many types of heavy metal ions in water sources which convince researcher to develop special adsorbents family with capability of simultaneous adsorption. In this respect, in on study, the simultaneous adsorption process of metal ions consists of Pb2þ, Cu2þ, Cr6þ, and Cd2þ using magnetic Fe3O4/mesoporous silica-based nanocomposite has been considered. Analysis of kinetics showed that adsorption cab be modeled with pseudo second-order, whereas the ions were adsorbed monolayer in which their isotherm of adsorption can be considered with Langmuir model. Based on this model, the maximum adsorption capacities were obtained equal to 127.24, 125.80, 115.60, and 114.08 mg.g 1 for Pb2þ, Cu2þ, Cr6þ and Cd2þ, respectively (Fig. 3) [73].\nMetal organic frameworks (MOFs) recently have been the major attention in various fields. These types of materials show great reliability for being used in water remediation because the high specific surface area, high surface free energy, ability to provide broad range of the surface area, and ability to engage in various functionalization based on their surface features for removal applications. In this communication, the Fe3O4/SiO2/Zr MOF magnetic adsorbent was applied to removal of the Pb2þ, methyl orange, and methylene blue dyes. This adsorbent shows the capacity of adsorption equal to 102.2, 219 and 128 mg/g, respectively [74]. The presence of MOF has a significant effect on\nthe capacity of adsorption. By the mean that the maximum adsorption capacity was rose up to 248 mg/g at pH 10 after 100 min at 25 C [56]."

      "text" : "Most of the published records have been dedicated to application of clay-based materials for removal of dyes, nutrients, and heavy metal ions. There are broad range of the clays such as montmorillonite, kaolinite, sepiolite, bentonite, and sericite which are in the center of the researchers' attentions because of their lowcost, high specific surface area, high chemical stability in broad range of pH and so on; for example, the montmorillonite large surface area potentially provides high capacity of adsorption in comparison with other alike. Many reports attributed to the fact that the heavy metal ions can be removed from liquid media using montmorillonite during the ion exchange mechanism and also adsorption process. The two main interactions are responsible to the adsorption process which involve electrostatic attractions and hydrogen bonding that could be formed between metal ions and surface sites and also between edge of montmorillonite surface [58,75]. For the talc (one another type of clay) surface, the adsorption mechanism is different because basically the talc surface divides into two non-polar ‘faces’ and polar ‘edges’ of the structure. Therefore, metal ions can potentially adsorb on negatively charged sites of the talc surface [76e78]. In this respect, Kalantari et al. [77] evaluated the capability of the magnetic Fe3O4/ talc-based nanocomposites as highly potent option for removal application of Cu2þ, Pb2þ, and Ni2þ. For these ions, although the\ninitial concentration was set at 100, 92, and 270 mg/L, the removal of the ions time were 120 s and also the adsorption capacity was determined equal to 74.62, 21.05, and 33.33 mg/g for Pb2þ, Cu2þ, and Ni2þ, respectively. In another study, Dong et al. [79] studied a novel nanocomposite which formed from hydroxyapatite/magnetite to evaluate its removal effect on Pb2þ ions (Fig. 4). They reported the peak adsorption capacity for this nanocomposite was 598.8 mg/g, in which the adsorption isotherm followed the Langmuir model.\nThe simultaneous removal of the heavy metal ions was considered by Yan et al. [44] for Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Cu2þ using Fe3O4/ bentonite as adsorbent which combined each other in 1.44:1 ratio of Fe3O4 to bentonite. They found that the equilibrium of adsorption process was achieved after 30 min, and the adsorption capacities measured and that were equal to 81.5, 21.7, and 19.6 mg/g for Pb2þ, Cd2þ, and Cu2þ, respectively."

      "text" : "As a commercial adsorbent, the activated carbon has been widely applied for many applications in various fields and also the removal of the heavy metals, dyes, and harmful nutrients. In recent years, the removal of contaminations in ppm and ppb concentration attracted a lot of attentions because of the harmful effect of the heavy metals even in the ppb level of concentrations [19,80]. In this respect, Yao et al. [81] considered the removal properties of the magnetic composition of the iron oxide/activated carbon for removal of Pb2þ ions. High specific surface area\nfor iron oxide/activated carbon which was 678.3 m2/g of the adsorbent and maximum adsorption capacity equal to 19.37 mg/g obtained great removal at pH ¼ 6. The mesoporous Fe2O3@C has another interesting encapsulate properties which makes it as appropriate option for removal of the arsenic ions. Moreover, the fast adsorption process of arsenic ions implies on the fact that the rate of adsorption can be fitted to pseudo second-order kinetics. In addition, the excellent reusability of this adsorbent proves its great chemical stability in the whole range of pH [82]. Increasing in temperature of the preparation of the composite causes great enhancement in absorption and saturation equilibrium of Fe2O3@C-300 and Fe2O3@C-500. For the samples, the reported capacity of adsorption were equal to ~19.3 and 29.4 mg.g 1 for As3þ ions and 8.0 and 17.9 mg.g 1 for As5þ ions [82]. The results indicated the different interactions between adsorbents and arsenic ions which rely on different absorption mechanism and subsequently different adsorption capacity. Moreover, the fast adsorption after 10 min of the 98% of As3þ which was in 5 ppm shows the remarkable kinetics of this type of adsorbents. The kinetics of adsorption was fitted on pseudo second-order model (Fig. 5) [82]. The capability of matrix to eliminate As3þ ions from the liquid media was considered which just in ~1.4 mg.g-1 at 25 C saturation capacity was measured. But the incorporation process which involves loading 52 wt% iron oxides on carbon during pyrolysis process at 300 and 500 C, significant adsorption was obtained to the samples which were equal to ~27.7 and 18.1 mg.g 1 for As3þ, respectively. The stable mono or/and bidentate coordination between iron oxide and ions are the main mechanism of the adsorption. The adsorption of As5þ on the carbon matrix and the Fe2O3@C-T encapsulates also showed the same results [82]."

      "text" : "The remarkable electrical and thermal properties of the carbonbased nanomaterial based on latest publications have introduced them as highly potent candidates for many electronic and other biological and biomedical applications [83]. Moreover, many other useful properties of these nanomaterials increase their capability of usage for water remediation because the large specific surface area, great ability for their surface chemical and physical modification and functionalization and so on. [84,85]. Most of the CNT's water treatment application was reported for heavy metals elimination [86]. In term of structural view, the CNTs can be found in twomains categorize of the single-walled CNTs and the multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) [87] which they differ on the number of the walls and the diameters [88,89]. CNTs as materials with high specific surface area exhibit significant adsorption capability of elimination many types of the heavy metals such Mn7þ, Tlþ, Cu2þ, Pb2þ, Cr6þ, and so on. [90e94]. The internal and external active sites of the CNTs potentially enhance their ability for these applications. In order for improving the capacity of adsorption for CNTs (removal of heavy metals) plausibly functional groups can be made during the functionalization process, in which they are carboxylic acids (eCOOH), amines (eNH2), hydroxyl (eOH) and so on. The functionalization process go through chemical and thermal methods and can be found even in omnipresent literatures [95]. For instance, in this process, the oxidant agents and materials can be used for improving the number and types of functional groups [96]. In this respect, recently, Mohamed et al. [97] demonstrated a functionalization method of CNTs for removal of Hg2þ. They reported allyl triphenyl phosphonium bromide and glycerol as a preoxidized agent in batch condition and pH of the adsorption of Hg2þ was set in 5.5 in which after 28 min of contact time in the peak adsorption\nwas observed also based on Freundlich isotherm model, and the maximum adsorption capacity was 186.97 mg$g 1. The adsorption kinetics for this type of adsorbent followed the pseudo secondorder. Although, the comprehensive consideration of carbon-based nanomaterial and their ability in removal application for heavy\nmetals were reviewed by Xu et al. [98]. In another argument, the combination of the CNTs with other materials could also give great composites with high ability of adsorption. In this communication, Zhan et al. [99] developed an amino-functionalized Fe3O4/carboxylic MWCNTs using solvothermal synthetic method. Observed\nappropriate efficiency in removal of the Cu2þ ions were resulted for the synergistic effect which originated from CNTs and the amino groups simultaneous present. in addition, they reported the adsorption capacity for Cu2þ was 30.49 mg$g 1 in which the isotherm of the adsorption satisfied by Langmuir model. In addition, the presence of the external induced magnetic field from the magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles could play an helpful role to increase the separation capacity. Despite of CNTs, successful removal functionality of the heavy metals, their applications could be limited because of some challenges that they encountered with. The first issue related to the final cost of separation which CNTs higher cost causes higher cost of separation. Second, dispersion problem of the CNTs which still remain as an unsolved challenge. Although many different methods been proposed for dispersion such as using ultrasonic waves, surfactant agents, and polymeric materials. But their dispersion in large-scale could restrict their usage in this field. Moreover, the separation process of the CNTs after adsorption process is another challenge which makes a risk of their pollution in water media and most importantly, they are potentially toxic and this aspect of the issue is under debate [95]."

      "text" : "Graphene is one of the most important and applicable 2D materials in which its great potential of application in water remediation, well understood at recent literatures through exceptional features in that, can be found just in this category. Because of the exceptional physiochemical properties such as mechanical, stiffness, electrical, thermal, optical and more especially high specific surface area are the characteristics of the G and its derivatives that make them as pioneer of the many applications such as water remediation and heavy metal adsorption from the wastewater sources [95]. GO and RGO are the two main derivatives of the G which is the base of many materials to obtain high capacity of adsorption of heavy metals during the water remediation process. The presence of the functional groups which mainly are the hydroxyl (-OH), carboxyl (-COOH), epoxide and carbonyl functional groups not only make the G sheets more hydrophilic to disperse in aqueous media but also make great potential for functionalization and composition of these types of materials and the MNPs [100]. Similar to the G, the RGO with eOH, eCOOH functional groups\ncould be modified easier than GO because of the mild oxidation condition and their easy dispersibility in water media [101]. The structure of the G and RGO for many years have been considered and finally their negative charges which could be related to the presence of the oxygen-containing functional groups and also the hydrophilic nature of the sheets are the main reasons for appropriate adsorption capacity of heavy metals (Fig. 6) [102].\nThe water remediation and heavy metal removal application of the G-, GO-, and RGO-based materials recently have been reported by many researchers. For example, Wang et al. [103] evaluated the factors that can play a role in heavy metal removal. These parameters were pH, concentration of the adsorbent, contact time of absorbate and adsorbent, temperature, and presence of the coexisting ions that may disrupt the removal process. Their results demonstrated that the monolayer adsorption fitted suitably with Langmuir isotherm and the kinetic of adsorption can be considered by pseudo second-order model. In accordance with their results, the capacity of adsorption for Zn2þ was more than 246 mg$g 1, which shows appropriate adsorption of Zn2þ by GO. In another study, Zhao et al. [104] developed ultrathin layers of the GO nanosheets using Hummers method. Their results indicated that the great adsorption could be obtained for the heavy metal ions removal such as Cd2þ and Co2þ. Interestingly, pH-dependent nature of the oxygen-contained functional groups which regulates the net charge of the GO sheets, the adsorption process extremely should be depended on pH. The adsorption capacities less or more could be affected by pH and for the Cd2þ and Co2þ were 106.3 and 68.2 mg$g 1, respectively. As mentioned previously, after dispersion of the G, GO, and RGO in water media, their separation is so difficult and needs many complicated separation processes which ended up with expensive costs. In this respect, Arshad et al. [105] developed as novel G-based adsorbent using calcium alginate which was embedded to GO and was reduced by polyethylenimine, and the adsorption capacity obtained for Pb2þ, Hg2þ, and Cd2þwere 602, 374, 181 mg$g 1, respectively which could be fitted on the Langmuir isotherm because of the monolayer adsorption of the ions. Moreover, they considered the kinetics of adsorption and results showed that the pseudo second-order kinetics could explain as well for this type of adsorbent. The functionalizing process of the calcium alginate plays a significant role in adsorption process and\nause negative charge on their surfaces.

The time of adsorption as one of the most important factors in commercialization process plays a significant role which is in order of the ~0.5e2.0 h. This time is too long, and it could limit the industrial and large-scale application of the nanomaterials in removal process. Therefore, increasing in kinetics of adsorption could be urgent."

The photocatalytic treatment mechanistically involves\nfour main interfacial and molecular mechanism. First, is contaminant (dyes, pigments, or other types of the organic molecules) diffusion process from the aqueous phase to the the photocatalyst interface; second, adsorption of dye molecules on the surface; third, oxidation of absorbed contaminants with radical spices; forth, desorption of the reaction products. In contrast to the adsorption approach that uses the adsorption mechanisms for removal of the dyes and heavy metals, pollutants have been degraded during some radical types of the reactions in presence of the photocatalysts in the photocatalytic approach. In this section, the types and mechanism of the photodegradation process comprehensively were discussed."

      "text" : "Basically, in this process, the highly active radical spices such as hydroxyl radicals (OH ) during a photocatalytic condition were generated and under the condition that the organic pollutants are in direct contact with these spices, they were degraded efficiently [146,147]. In accordance with the photocatalytic degradation phenomenon, this process has several benefits in comparison with the\nadsorption approach. First, it is about the concentration of the pollutants, in which these types of removal can significantly carry out, whereas in adsorption approach, removal in ultralow concentration removal of the heavy metals of dyes still remained as a challenge [148]. Enhanced adsorption and consecutive photocatalytic degradation phenomenon of dyes possibly encountered with several problem. Photocatalyst deactivation (i.e. loss of photocatalyst active sites) is a gradual process which associated with considerable decline in the removal efficiency of dyes and get worse as by-products increased just because of partial oxidation of organic compounds. In this context, one of the problems is that simply related to intermediate products accumulation on the nanomaterial surface which through physical blocking of active\nFig. 9.

The Elsevier. CNTs, carbon nanotubes.\nsites put limitation on photon accessibility to the catalyst surface. When this process is repeated several times, nanomaterial loses their efficiency and functionality [149]. Even in the case of the wide-gap semiconductors (e. g. TiO2), it had been revealed that presence of some functional groups such as surface hydroxyl groups, for the formation of the photo-induced oxygen vacancies resulted in higher regeneration in comparison with photocatalysts with low hydroxyl group. Interestingly, for regeneration of active sites in semiconductors, it would be enough to expose nanomaterials to UV light and H2O(g)-rich atmosphere simultaneously [150]. Keeping the humidity content for stabilizing efficacy of photodegradation in the reactor possibly would be enough to continuously rehydrate the photocatalyst surface [151].

Oxygen injection causes production of more radicals for the degradation of toxic hydrocarbon species [152]. The schematic representation of\nthe photocatalytic process of the organic pollutants' degradation on the silver-ZnO-MWCNT as a photoactive catalyst was depicted in Fig. 8. In this process, the hole-electron formation after incident the light photons could generate a charge transfer in photocatalyst\nwhich facilitates the formation of the O 2- radicals. The generated radicals could degrade the organic pollutants.\nThe advanced oxidation process of the organic pollutants refers to the procedures that uses from the sunlight and ultra-violet irradiations. In addition, the ozonation process on wet aqueous media are the other categories of the chemical degradation of the pollutants [153]."

      "heading" : "3.2. CNT-based photocatalysts",
      "text" : "In recent years, the CNT-based composites showed great reliability to use as photocatalysts for removal of the organic pollutants because of their potential ability to functionalize and develope composites with better physiochemical properties. The functionalization not only could enhance the specific surface area for CNTs with increasing in dispersibility, but also make it possible for dyes to interact more efficiently with photocatalytic sites [154e157]. For example, Si/Al@Fe/MWCNT which coated with ferrocene groups showed appropriate photocatalytic activity for photodegradation process of methyl orange, methyl blue orange G, and acid orange 7. All parameters that can play a role in photocatalytic degradation were evaluated, and the pH, time of reaction, concentration of H2O2, amount of catalyst, and temperature were the parameters which potentially control the efficiency of photodegradation process [158]. In this respect, recent development of novel type of CNTs/TiO2/AgNPs/surfactant photocatalyst was synthesized and was applied for removal of the methyl blue dye contamination. In accordance with results, the presence of the CNT in nanocomposite could increase the electronic behavior of TiO2, and the presence of AgNPs could increase the stability of photocatalyst during the formation of the hole-electron pairs and reduce the band gap of the photocatalyst (<2.25 eV). Another effect of AgNPs is enhancement of the specific surface area of the photocatalyst which could facilitate the degradation process. The results proved the presence of the OH radical which plays an important role in degradation. The maximum photorefraction efficiency for each dye was calculated as\nfollows: 32.9%, 63.7%, 75.6%, and 99.9% for acid orange 7, orange G, methyl blue, and methyl orange, respectively after exposure time equal to 140 min [155]. The influence of the CNTs diameter on the photocatalytic activity was evaluated for enhancing the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants under microwave condition. CNTs with various diameters. The different size range of CNTs (10e20, 20e40 and 40e60 nm). The results showed that after just seven minutes 100% of the methyl orange dye was degraded by CNTs with 10e20 nm in diameter under the 25 mg/L of dye concentration and also 1.2 g/L of the CNT dosage. The smaller diameter not only increases the specific surface area but also can increase the gap of the CNTs (Fig. 9) [159].\n3.3. Carbon nanorodebased photocatalysts\nCarbon nanorods with high specific surface area recently attracted a lot of attention in photodegradation of dye pollutants removal. Reports showed the facts that the superoxide pathway of the dye degradation under sunlight condition has sufficiently done. Recently Bhati et al. [160] developed water-soluble graphitic hollow carbon nanorods for MB degradation which their results showed rapid dye degradation after 120 min.\n3.4. GO and RGO and quantum dotebased photocatalysts\nAs one of the reliable catalysts, the GO and RGO-based materials and their derivatives show great potential application in removal of the organic contaminants with photodegradation process. Frommechanistic view of the issue, the G and RGO-based photocatalysts have the same mechanism of the degradation which discussed for the CNTs [161e164]. This part of the review discusses the materials and mechanism of decomposition of dye contaminates in water media. Recently, Mohamed et al. [165] developed an MnFe2O4/GO with sol-gel synthesis method. They reported a spindle-like nanostructure which showed appropriate photocatalytic activity to degrade methylene blue dye in water\nmedia under visible light condition. In accoradnce with the results, this type of photocatalyst could decompose the methylene blue in 1 g/L of dosage in lesser than 30 min under the condition that the concentration of the dye was 10 mg/L. They estimated that the rate constant of photodegradation process was 0.037 min 1. Another semiconductor which shows great potential of photodegradation if it combines with RGO is CdS. Using gamma-ray radiation method, the CdS/RGO photocatalyst was synthesized for removal of the Rhodamine B. The results show more than 93% of degradation efficiency under visible light condition (Fig. 10) [166].\nThe combination of TiO2 and CdS with RGO and also ZnO microwires and nanowires are another strategy for obtaining better photodegradation efficiency of organic dyes [167]. In this communication, TiO2-CdS/RGO which prepared in solvothermal method has been applied for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue. Because of high specific surface area of TiO2-CdS/ RGO (109.7 m2/g) in comparison with bare TiO2-CdS with 67 m2/g and also 53 m2/g for CdS photocatalytic degradation reaction progress had higher rate which the more kinetic of removal could be related to the presence of RGO. The kinetic measurements of\nphotocatalyst showed the 97.5%, 94.0%, and 78.5% of reaction efficiency for TiO2-CdS/RGO, TiO2-CdS and bare CdS, respectively, which run in 20 min under visible light. The synergetic influence of RGO has been as the main reason for increasing in reaction efficiency [168]. The magnetic photocatalysts could decompose the organic pollutants as well as the magnetic adsorbents. Therefore, CuFe2O4/GO which is prepared by hydrothermal synthetic method indicated great capability in photodegradation of dyes. Considering more details through mechanistic events showed that the presence of O$2 spices which were generated from the hole-electron separation could be as the main reason for dye decomposition even after five times of reusability test (Fig. 11) [169].\nRecently the quantum dots providemany biological applications because of their photoluminescence properties and also their ability for surface functionalization is another advantage for them. Their photocatalytic capabilities would be good because if their green nature. In this respect, Das et al. [170] reported that this type of materials has ability for using in label-free detection of the Fe3þ and ascorbic acid detection and also highly efficient (~99.5%) photocatalytic degradation of MB dye after 130 min."

In this respect, the photocatalytic performance of a 3D composite based on carbon nano-onion which is functionalized with ZnO was considered by Seung to study the photocatalytic degradation of 2,4-dinitrophenol. Their results showed 92% efficiency of photodegradation after 140min under visible light. High charge-separation efficiency is the main reason for great photocatalytic activity [171].\n3.6. Graphene dotebased photocatalysts\nGraphene quantum dots have recently presented wide range of applications, for eaxmple, bioimaging, light-emitting devices, and photocatalysis because of high active area and great optical and physiochemical properties. They are environmentally friendly and highly robust for using in harsh UV and visible light irradiation condition. Recent reports showed evidences that proves the graphene dots photocatalytic capabilities. For example, Dengyu et al. [172] developed a heterojunction composite of the graphene dot and TiO2 nanoparticles for removal of the MO dye. Their results indicated that quantum dotebased heterojunctions can remarkably represent the fast recombination of electron-hole pairs whichmake their photocatalytic activities more possible (Fig. 12).\nA brief comparison between carbon-based photocatalysts shows that the morphology could be as one of the main criterions for obtaining an efficient photocatalyst. The size andmorphology of the carbon-based photocatalysts directly influence on efficiency of hole-electron pairs and subsequently on photocatalytic efficiency and kinetics. These types of the photocatalysts have several advantages in comparison with other nanomaterials for photocatalytic applications. First, they are green and environmentally safe. Therefore, the photocatalysts separation process does not require, whereas adsorption approaches essentially requires to adsorbent separation because of their toxic nature. Second, they have greater specific surface area which makes it possible to better interaction between dye molecules and the photocatalyst interface. Third, their light absorption area depends on nanoparticles size. Therefore, combining these nanomaterials in various sizes could enhance their light absorption and quantum yield and subsequently the efficiency of electron-hole separation. In contrast to these facts, they have some disadvantages. One of the most important problems that this photocatalysts are struggling with, is\ntheir low stability against harsh chemical medium which was produced during photodegradation. Production the radical spices could potentially change the photocatalyst surface and subsequently their photocatalytic activity. Table 2 obviously shows that although the reaction efficiency of the photodegradation is high, the longtime of the reaction could restrict their applications. Moreover, this approach could not be used for removal of heavy metals. A brief comparison between photocatalyst and adsorption approach shows that these approaches suffer from low kinetics of adsorption and photodegradation. According to this fact, developing materials with high kinetics of removal could be valuable."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusion and prospective",
      "text" : "In this review, broad summary advanced materials with adsorption and photocatalytic application of water treatment were discussed in detail. Still, there are abundant efforts for finding materials which be able to treat the water sources are ongoing, and many researchers are developing new types of the materials with high specific surface area and photocatalytic properties. Magnetic, carbon based (G, GO, RGO, CNTs, QDs), silica, zeolites and other types of the materials recently were showed great potential of application in these field. On the other hand, the adsorbent and photocatalytic materials are the main reliable candidates still struggling with many challenges that restrict their large-scale application. High specific surface area and kinetics of adsorption and decomposition are the main characteristics of these materials which make them suitable to treat wastewater even in ultralow concentration of the pollutants. The interfacial and morphological properties of the adsorbents during adsorption heavy metals and organic dyes are the key parameters for the adsorption approach, whereas for photodegradation approach goes beyond the mentioned points like the kinetic of photocatalytic reaction, holeelectron separation efficiency, active radical spices formation and light absorption ability of the photocatalysts play important roles. As far as we know, the adsorption approach encounters with risk of desorption of adsorbate spices during removal process which this challenge has mostly been observed to nonmagnetic nanomaterials because of the long-time adsorption. For Fe2O3-based magnetic adsorbents because the possibility of short-time external induced separation processes the risk of desorption is low, whereas for clay, zeolite, silica and carbon nanomaterials, the risk of desorption is higher than the standards. In addition, in one hand, short time of hole-electron pairs of photocatalyst limits the concentration of the\nradical spices. On the other hand, low kinetic of photocatalytic reaction which mainly relates to low concentration of the radical spices increases the time of photodegradation. Because of mentioned challenges that these types of the materials are straggling with, designing a family of materials with dual adsorption and photocatalytic properties would be facilitate and still it is remained under debates. QDs with great optical and morphological properties could be as reliable options in large-scale water treatment applications because they can represent dual adsorption and photocatalytic features. These capabilities which mainly result from their ultralow size of the particles, represent great absorption capacity as an adsorbent and visible light sensitive property for photocatalytic degradation. The time of treating that refers to the contact time between contaminants and adsorbent (photocatalyst) is an important and characteristic parameter which influences on the commercialization process of these novel methods of water remediation. The surface area, surface wettability state which relates to the surface free energy and morphology, functional groups, methods of modification are the parameters could potentially influence on the treating time. In fact, the surface wettability state could play a significant role; likewise mentioned previously the superhydrophobic photocatalysts were developed for increasing the efficiency of photodegradation reactions. These types of the surfaces and materials not only could increase the adsorption capacity but also can facilitate the enrichment process of the organic dyes or pollutants on the surface. The superhydrophobic materials with localizing effect on dye molecules which facilitates their diffusion from themedium to the substrate could decrease the time of adsorption and photodegradation significantly. Many types of the self-cleaning superhydrophobic surfaces recently were reported in literatures which have mentioned to this fact that the organic, hydrophobic and lipid molecules could be self-cleaned on TiO2-based superhydrophobic surfaces because of the light sensitive properties of the TiO2. This subject turn on many thoughts in the minds by the mean that superhydrophobic materials not only could increase the rate of adsorption of organic materials at the interface but also during photodegradation process could remove them efficiently. Moreover, photocatalytic materials essentially need to bestow on the condition which the electron-hole separation was carried out significantly. The doping, functionalization, composing with other photocatalyst materials and changing in their crystallinity are themain strategies for this aim. Low solubility in harsh chemical condition under irradiation is another desired property that controls the photocatalytic activity. Another one is the band gap of the semiconductor materials which may improve their light absorption and quantum efficiency. Therefore, considering the types of the nanomaterials and their physiochemical properties effect on adsorption and photocatalytic decomposition process could help us to design better materials for water treatment applications.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThere is no conflict to declare."

This review comprehensively considered the recent advanced materials water treatment methods which involve to magnetic, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene (G), graphene oxide (GO), (Graphene) quantum dots, carbon nanorods, carbon nano-onions, and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), zeolite, silica and clay-based nanomaterials. The adsorption and photocatalytic properties of these nanomaterials introduced them as highly potent option for heavy metal ions and organic dyes removal and photocatalytic degradation. High specific surface area in conjugation with presenting higher kinetics of adsorption and decomposition are the main characteristics of these materials which make them appropriate to treat wastewater even in ultralow concentration of the pollutants. Considering the mechanistic aspects of the adsorption and photocatalytic decomposition process, challenges and opportunities were other subjects that have been highlighted for the discussed nanomaterials. In term of the adsorption approaches, the mechanism of adsorptions and their influence on the maximum adsorption capacity were discussed and also for photocatalyst approach the radical active spices and their role in kinetic and efficiency of the organic pollutant decomposition were provided a deep",
