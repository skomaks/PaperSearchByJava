The results showed that the application of MHA/NHA effectively increased soil pH and decreased soil available Cu content, and showed the highest increasing effects on the activities of urease, catalase and acid phosphatase.

Additionally, the relative abundance of potential plant growth promoting bacteria increased with the addition of MHA/NHA, which was confirmed by the characteristics (the ability of producing indole acetic acid and siderophore) of bacterial strains. These results suggested that these dominate bacterial populations with significant changes may be regarded as the biomarkers for the recovery of soil ecological environment, which provides a theoretical basis for the ecological evaluation of MHA/NHA.\n© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Large areas of soil were polluted by heavy metal elements, such as copper (Cu), because of frequent mining activities, which caused serious damages to soil ecosystems (Alvarenga et al., 2012). In the past decades, a variety of conventional and novel technologies have been proposed to remediate heavy metal-contaminated soils, including chemical precipitation, electrochemical treatment, ionexchange, oxidation/reduction and so on (Zou et al., 2016). However, these technologies have been limited in practical application, mainly due to many disadvantages such as high cost, complexity and secondary pollution. (Sun et al., 2013). Therefore, the combination of in-situ chemical immobilization and phytoremediation has been suggested as an economical and effective method for the remediating of heavy metal-contaminated agricultural soils (Liang et al., 2013).\nThe objective of immobilization is to decrease bioavailability of soil heavy metals rather than the total amount (Fernandez-Caliani and Barba-Brioso, 2010). As an important component of soil ecosystem, microorganisms are more sensitive to soil disturbance than animals and plants (Giller et al., 2009). It was confirmed that the microbial community structure and soil enzyme activity could directly reflect the toxicity of heavy metals, which is beneficial to the evaluation of remediation methods (Kumpiene et al., 2006). Therefore, the mechanism of soil microbial community composition responding to immobilization remediation based on the amendments application, has attracted increasing attention in recent years (Baker et al., 2011; Bertocchi et al., 2006; Dell'Anno et al., 2003). For instance, Sun et al. (2016) found that the application of various amounts of sepiolite decreased the content of soil available cadmium, and significantly increased soil microbial biomass and diversity. Additionally, Giovanni et al. (2014) found that iron containing amendment could promote the abundance, diversity and enzyme activity of soil microbial community in arsenic- and lead-contaminated soils. With the development of nanotechnology, a variety of micro-/nano-materials have been widely used in immobilization due to its small particle size and special chemical reactivity (Xing et al., 2016). Previous studies have shown that nano silver could be efficiently used as amendment, pesticide and herbicide; however, this compound has been shown to be have strongly cytotoxic and genetically toxic to nitrifying bacteria (Choi and Hu, 2008; Samarajeewa et al., 2017). The addition of various concentrations of sodium alginate-modified nanoscale zero-valent iron increased soil enzyme activities and bacterial community diversity which indicates the recovery of metabolic function to some extent (Huang et al., 2016).\nMicro-/nano-hydroxyapatite (MHA/NHA) can effectively affect the bioavailability and geochemical stability of soil heavy metals due to its special chemical reactivity and small surface area (Cui et al., 2013; Xing et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2010). Besides, both MHA and NHA were efficient in decreasing the accumulation of heavymetals such as Cu by pakchoi (Brassica chinensis L.), andMHA\nwas superior to NHA in immobilization of heavy metals (Li et al., 2014). Pot experiments indicated that the capacity of lead absorption by plant from the soil could be significantly reduced by the application of NHA and biochar (Yang et al., 2016). Additionally, the total Cu uptake of ryegrass was significantly decreased with the increasing application of NHA in a greenhouse pot experiment (Sun et al., 2018). To date, the mechanism of soil microorganisms responding to the application of MHA/NHA is little studied. Wei et al. (2016) found that the soil bacterial diversity and community structure were both altered under the application of NHA in an ewaste-contaminated soil. Particularly, the percentage of Stenotrophomonas sp. and Bacteroides increased during the experiment. Moreover, Cui et al. (2018) suggested that the soil microbial community composition varied with the hydroxyapatite of different sizes, and Chloroflexi is sensitive to repair materials. However, the response of the biomarkers to the application of MHA/NHA has not been studied during the immobilization process, which was considered a very important part for the ecological evaluation of MHA/NHA.\nThe key to in-situ immobilization remediation is to select suitable amendment. Presently, different amendments such as calcium-silicon materials, phosphorus-containing materials, clay mineral materials, micro-/nanomaterials and so on, have been used in the remediation of heavy metals-polluted soils (Gray et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2009; Zhou and Haynes, 2010). Three typical representative of calcium-silicon and phosphorous-containing immobilization amendments, alkaline slag, lime and apatite, have beenwidely used owing to its alleviation of soil acidity and antagonistic effect on heavymetals (Gray et al., 2006; Mignardi et al., 2012). Therefore, three traditional amendments were selected as the control materials for NHA and MHA in this study. The purposes of the present study were as follows: i) to study the difference of the bacteria abundance and their diversity patterns under the treatment of MHA, NHA and other conventional immobilized amendments (AS, L and AP) for three years with 16S rDNA sequencing technology; ii) to identify the biomarkers for different bacterial communities following MHA and NHA application; and iii) to provide a theoretical basis for the establishment of an ecological evaluation system for MHA and NHA."

      "text" : "The experiment of this study is carried out in Guixi, Jiangxi Province, China (117 1203500E, 28 1904400N). Surrounding farmland is suffering from Cu pollution because farmers use wastewater contaminated with heavy metals from discharge and atmospheric deposition (Xu et al., 2017), resulting in a Cu concentration higher than second grade requirement of soil environmental quality standards of China (GB 15618-1995).\nThree replicates were set up for in-situ field experiments and\nthe plots were arranged randomly. Every experimental plot occupied 6m2 (2m 3m), and was separated from each other by the same plastic plates. The treatments of two micro-/nano-materials and three classical immobilized amendments were applied: (1) 1.0% micro-hydroxyapatite (MHA) (w/w, based on the weight of the 17 cm depth surface soil, approximately 11.1 ton ha 1), (2) 1.0% nano-hydroxyapatite (NHA), (3) 0.5% alkali residue (AS), (4) 0.2% lime (L), (5) 1% apatite (AP), and (6) the control without any amendments (CK). The doses selected in this experiment were set up according to the data of our previous experiments. The details of the amendments were shown in Table S1. On December 26, 2012, the soil and the test amendments above were completely blended with a harrow, and then irrigated fully by tap water. Elsholtzia splendens (E. splendens), a perennial Cu tolerant plant, was used for phytoremediation (70 plants per plot) and cultured at a 30-cm spacing in each plot on April 26 in 2013, 2014, and 2015. The test immobilized amendments were only added in 2012, whereas the test plant E. splendens was collected in every December during the study period (from 2012 to 2015)."

To prevent contamination, 75% alcohol was used to clean the soil auger, then completely rinsed with sterile water after sampling from different plots. The soil cores from each replicate plot were composited together as a mixed sample. These collected soil samples were filtered through a mesh (2mm) to separate fronds, roots and stones. The resulting soil samples were then separated into two subsamples. One was kept at 4 C to examine soil chemical properties, soil enzyme activities, and isolate plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB). Another was kept at 80 C for total bacterial DNA extraction."

The contents of soil organic matter, total and available nitrogen (N), phosphate (P) and potassium (K) were measured following the method described by Xu et al. (2017). Total Cu concentrations of the soil were evaluated by a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Hitachi Model Z-2000, Japan) after the soil samples were digested with mixed acid (HNO3: HF: HClO4¼1: 2: 1) on a hot plate. Digestion process includes 1 h of 120 C, then 2 h of 200 C, and a final 240 C until the end. In order to confirm the accuracy of the data, certified soil reference material (GBW07405, National Research Center for Certified Reference Materials, China) was used. The concentration of the bioavailable Cu was denoted by 0.01mol L 1 CaCl2 extracting solution at a (w/v) ratio of 1: 5 of soil to CaCl2 solution. The extracting process was carried out by shaking the extracting mixture for 2 h at 25 C. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10min, and then decanted and filtered through a filter of 0.45 mm.

For the sake of the acquiring total culturable bacteria, 10-fold serially diluted soil suspensions were cultured onto a LB (1/5-strength) medium. To prevent fungi growth, 10mg USP-grade fungicidin (Amresco, USA) was added into 1 L autoclaved media and incubated at 28 C for 7 d. After that, 50 single colonies were randomly selected from each treatment. A total of 300 strains were obtained for qualitative determination of biological characteristics after separation and purification. The ability of the soil bacteria to produce indole acetic acid (IAA) and siderophores was determined according to the methods described in Zhang et al. (2012).\n2.6.

The barcode and primer were cut off and the chimeras were checked by the USEARCH tool (6.1.544) (Edgar, 2010) using the RDP Gold database for reference. Next, obtained 16S rRNA high-quality sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the Closed-reference OTU selection method and the Greengene database for reference in QIIME (gg_13_5 version) (McDonald et al., 2012). 16,000 sequences were subsampled from each sample before further analysis to compare the differences between soil bacterial communities.\nThe Chao 1, Shannon and Simpson's diversity indices were used to evaluate alpha-diversity of different bacterial community. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was used to analyze betadiversity based on the calculated Bray-Curtis distance for different treatments, which was performed in ape library of the R software package (version 3.1.2) (Paradis et al., 2004). The contribution rate of different environmental variables on the bacterial communities was determined by Redundancy analysis (RDA) using vegan library of R software. The variables of the environment significantly related to the RDA model (P< 0.05) were selected. The percentages of variance explained by each factor were determined by canonical variation partitioning (Sun et al., 2016). The correlation between microbial community and environmental variables was calculated by the Mantel test in R software. The Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated to evaluate the potential relationship between the diversity of bacterial community and soil chemical property with IBM Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) Statistics for windows (Version 21) (Hauke and Kossowski, 2011). Statistical differences between the different treatments were analyzed using ANOVA, andmultiple comparisons of means were performed by Tukey's honest significance difference test at 95% confidence interval."

      "text" : "After application of the amendments and with the continuous growth of E. splendens, no significant differences were observed in the total Cu content. However, the soil pH value was significantly increased, and the available Cu (extracted with CaCl2) concentration significantly decreased (Table 1), which was same as our previous studies (Xu et al., 2017). The lowest available Cu content was\nidentified in the treatment of MHA, followed by NHA, which means that the immobilization effects of MHA and NHA were better than other classical amendments and that MHA is superior to NHA, which agrees with the conclusion of Li et al. (2014). Considering the crucial influence of pH on the bioavailability of heavy metals in the soil, it is possible to reduce the availability of heavy metals by enhancing the soil pH value through co-remediation with the amendments combined with plant cover (Antoniadis and Golia, 2015). During the three-year experimental period, E. splendens grew only in the amended soils. The growth of plants can increase the amount of litter and influence the soil structure, further leading to the enrichment of soil organic matter (Gunina et al., 2015). Thus, the organic matter content increased significantly after three years of remediation. Additionally, there were no significant changes observed between different treatments in terms of the total N and K, but the application of AP, MHA and NHA could lead to the significantly increased concentration of total P, which could mainly be due to the presence of phosphorus in the three amendments (Xu et al., 2017). Meanwhile, all amendments significantly increased the content of available N, P and K compared to CK."

In this study, the activities of urease, catalase and acid phosphatase were significantly increased by the application of the five test amendments (P< 0.05) (Fig. 1), especially phosphorus-containing materials (AP, MHA and NHA), and were negatively correlated with the concentration of available Cu. Soil enzyme are easily influenced by the environment are catalysts for most soil transformation processes (Yang et al., 2013). The strengthening effects of amendments on the activities of soil enzyme in this study could be attributed to decreased available Cu content that resulted from the amendments application. It was also reported by Wei et al. (2016) that the application of NHA in heavy metal-contaminated soil increased acid phosphatase activity. Therefore, the application of MHA and NHA were most efficient in alleviating the toxicity of Cu and increasing the activity of soil microorganisms."

      "text" : "Bacterial abundancewas evaluated by qPCR analysis of 16S rRNA genes. The results of qPCR revealed significant difference between\nthe amended soils and the control (Fig. 2a). The highest bacterial abundance existed in the AP and AS treatments (4.12 1010 and 3.94 1010 copies g 1 soil, respectively), which were more than two times that of the control. Additionally, the bacterial abundance in the different treatments was closely correlated with the biomass of E. splendens; plant growth could effectively increase the nutrient supply for microorganism growth (Xu et al., 2017). These results indicate that all the amendments were effective in alleviating the toxicity of copper soil, increasing bacterial biomass and restoring the soil ecological function.\nDissimilarity analysis was used to compare the beta-diversity between the different treatments on the basis of the Bray-Curtis distance (Fig. 2b). The data show that there was no significant difference between the amended treatments. On the contrary, the differences between amended treatments and CK were significant (P< 0.05). It strongly implicate that the difference between amended soils and CK is greater than that among the amended treatments. In addition, the same conclusion can be obtained from the results of PCoA (Fig. S1). The amended treatments were distant from CK (P< 0.05, Fig. S1), indicating that the application of all the amendments greatly influenced the microbial community structure. However, the amended treatments were closer to each other than to the unamended control, which may be explained by the addition of amendments once for three years, and the same plants were cultured throughout the entire period.\nThe unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA) was used to calculate the phylogenetic relationship among different bacterial communities (Fig. 2c). At the similarity level of 90%, all the samples were mainly classified into two groups in which one included samples treated with the different test amendments and the other was the control (Fig. 2c). The AS- and Ltreated samples were clustered together with the MHA-treated samples. Moreover, the data from the three replicates was very closely related to each other. The results indicate the soil bacterial community structure varied greatly with the amendments application, which were consistent with the results of dissimilarity analysis and PCoA. The relative abundance of soil bacteria at the phylum level was provided in Fig. 2c. Some microorganisms were favored, such as Proteobacteria (including Alpha-, Beta-, delta- and Gemma-proteobacteria), Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, AD3, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes, were the six most dominant phyla of bacterial community, accounting for 85e93% of 16S rDNA gene sequences in each treatment. In addition, Gemma-proteobacteria (27.49%) was the most abundant class in the control but significantly decreased in the amended treatments (4.80e10.68%). In contrast, the amount of Beta-proteobacteria was only 2.67% in the control, but it was significantly increased in the treatments (11.70e26.35%).\nChao 1, Shannon and Simpson's diversity indices were regarded ideal for diversity analysis (de Almeida Fernandes et al., 2018). The indices achieved from deep sequencing and the number of observed OTUs are shown in Table 2. The alpha-diversity of the bacterial community in test amendments treated soil was revealed\nbased on the indices. Significant variations were observed between the treated soil and the control. Compared to CK, both the diversity indices and the number of OTUs increased significantly in the amended treatments, indicating that the application of amendments improved the soil environment and increased the richness of microbial community. Moreover, the diversity indices of bacterial communities from the AP- and AS- treated soil were significantly higher than the other amendments treated soil (P< 0.05), implying that MHA and NHA are inferior to the classical materials in increasing the richness of the bacterial community."

These sequences were assigned by QIIME software and then compared with the NCBI database. OTUs with relative abundance more than 1% were considered to be the dominant populations. According to the deep sequencing data, there were 30 dominant OTUs in total. Proteobacteria (17 of 30 dominant OTUs) and Acidobacteria (8 of 30 dominant OTUs) were identified the most dominant phyla in the soil (Fig. 3), which were frequent phyla found in heavy metalspolluted soil (Gołębiewski et al., 2014), and may be important in immobilization. Among these 30 dominant OTUs, the relative abundances of 19 OTUs (denote by red stars in Fig. 3) in the amended-treatments is significantly different from CK (P< 0.05) will be further analyzed.\nThe results showed that some microbial populations had a preference for the acid or alkaline environment (acidophilic or alkaliphilic). OTU225556 (the most abundant OTU in amended soils) belonged to AD3 with significantly higher relative abundance in the test amendments treated soil than the control (P< 0.05), especially in theMHA and NHA treatments (Fig. 3). This OTU closely related to Caldalkalibacillus sp. (Fig. 3, Table S5), belonging to a class of alkaliphilic bacteria (Xue et al., 2006). On the contrary, the relative abundances of OTU141364 (the most abundant OTU in CK) and OTU4062895 (closely related to Acidobacterium capsulatum) (Table S5) significantly decreased in the treatments with the amendments compared to the control (Fig. 3). The relative abundances of OTU509622 and OTU4361862 (most closely related to Acidibacter ferrireducens) (Table S5) also decreased after the application of amendments (P< 0.05), especially in the MHA and NHA treatments. These two species were found in acid mine drainage (AMD), were categorized as acidophiles (Falag an and Johnson, 2014). AMD is very acidic and it contains a large number of heavy metals harmful to the surrounding water and soil environment (Wan et al., 2009). The relative abundances of alkaliphilic bacteria increased in amended soil, whereas the relative abundance of acidophilic bacteria decreased. In addition, the relative abundance of these OTUs were significantly correlated with soil pH and the\nl communities under different treatments.\navailable Cu content (P< 0.05) (Table S2), suggesting that the risk of leaching heavy metals was reduced by application of the amendments, especially MHA and NHA.\nMoreover, some microbial populations responded passively to the application of the amendments. The relative abundances of OTU113467 (affiliated with Azospirillum sp.), OTU589233 (most closely related to Chondromyces sp., belonging to Myxococcales order taxa), OTU1057310 and OTU1059748 (most closely related to Thermosinus carboxydivorans) (Table S5) decreased significantly in the amended treatments (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3), and have a significant negative correlation with soil pH (P< 0.05) (Table S2). The Azospirillum sp. and Myxococcales were identified as denitrifying bacteria (de Almeida Fernandes et al., 2018), and the abundance of denitrifying bacteria was positively related to the amount of heavy metals in soil (Guo et al., 2014). Therefore, the reduction of OTU abundance may be related to the decrease in available Cu, which indicates the mitigation of soil toxicity. Besides, Thermosinus carboxydivorans belongs to WPS-2 (phylum), which was reported as the dominant bacteria in red soil; its abundance was positively correlated with the degree of Cu stress (Li et al., 2016). The decrease in WPS-2 abundance may be a response to the lower available Cu content in the soil caused by the application of the amendments.\nObviously, the alteration of available Cu content and soil pH are greatly influenced by chemical processes, such as precipitation reactions, redox reactions and so on. Soil bacteria can also immobilize heavy metals through redox reactions. For example, OTU816092 (affiliated with Thiodictyon sp.) (Table S5) belonged to\niron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB), and OTU588703 and OTU590693 (most closely related to Geobacter bemidjiensis) (Table S5) belonged to iron-reducing bacteria (FeRB); these are abundant and frequently monitored groups of microbial communities in AMD (Walton and Johnson, 1992). FeOB could establish a low cell surface pH to effectively inhibit the precipitation of FeIII mineral on the cell surface, which is the mainmechanism for photoferrotrophs (Hegler et al., 2010). The relative abundance of FeOB was significantly decreased after the application of the amendments, implying that the possibility of leaching heavy metals was reduced. Besides, FeRB plays key roles in carbon cycling and biogeochemical transformations that can be utilized for environmental bioremediation (Luef et al., 2013). Thus, the increase in FeRB is beneficial for environmental remediation, suggesting that bacteria could also participate in the immobilization effect with the amendments.\nThe relative abundance of OTU940737 (most closely related to Acidovorax sp.) increased greatly in the amended treatments (P< 0.05) (Fig. 3, Table S5). This genus is characterized by the production of promoting substances for plant growth and tolerance to multiple heavy metals (Pereira and Castro, 2004). Moreover, the relative abundance of OTU1033018, OTU1060517 (most closely related to Massilia sp.) and OTU654742 (most closely related to Sphingomonas sp.) (Table S5) also increased significantly in amended soils (P< 0.05) (Fig. 3), especially in the MHA and NHA treatments, and have a positive correlation with the plant biomass (Table S2), It has been reported that Massilia sp. and Sphingomonas sp. were the dominant genera in the soil polluted by heavy metal\n(Hong et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). The strains isolated from these two genera are reported to produce plant growth-promoting substances, such as IAA, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase, siderophores, acyl-homoserine lactones and so on (Chimwamurombe et al., 2016).\nOTU151729, OTU636026, OTU215700 and OTU302530 (most closely associated with Acidobacterium ailaaui and Granulicella sp. respectively) (Table S5) belonged to Koribacteraceae (family), which has been reported to be a useful indicator of soil degradation. (Soman et al., 2017). The relative abundance of all the four OTUs decreased in the soils amended with phosphorus-containing materials (AP, MHA and NHA). Moreover, Jenkins et al. (2017) reported the significant decrease of the abundance of Koribacteraceae after a year of biochar amendment in soil. Therefore, the results indicate that the application of phosphorus-containing amendments, especially MHA and NHA, may alleviate soil degradation.\nPrevious studies have shown that MHA/NHA has been extensively used to immobilize soil heavymetals (Cui et al., 2013, 2018; Li et al., 2014; Xing et al., 2016). However, as a component of soil ecosystem, the response of microorganisms to immobilization is critical for the ecological evaluation of amendments (Zhou et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015). In the present study, the bacterial community structures were altered by the application of MHA/NHA. Specifically, the relative abundance of alkaliphilic bacteria (Caldalkalibacillus sp.), FeRB (Geobacter bemidjiensis), and PGPB (Acidovorax sp., Massilia sp. and Sphingomonas sp.) increased with the amendments. Additionally, the relative abundances of acidophiles (Acidobacterium capsulatum and Acidibacter ferrireducens), denitrifying bacteria (Azospirillum sp. and Myxococcales), Cu-sensitive bacteria (WPS-2), FeOB (Thiodictyon sp.) and the indicator of soil degradation decreased after the application of MHA/NHA. In the process of remediation, the significant changes of these dominant bacterial populations are accompanied by the improvement of soil properties. Therefore, these dominant microbial flora can be regarded as the biomarkers for the recovery of contaminated soil. In addition, it can be quickly understand whether the ecological environment has been improved or not by focusing on the changes of the biomarkers. Moreover, the discovery of these biomarkers will be meaningful for the ecological evaluation of MHA/NHA, and also provide theoretical support for the establishment of the evaluation system of MHA/NHA."

      "text" : "Bacterial community structure is greatly influenced by the environment (Horner-Devine et al., 2004). The result of RDA\nshowed that 55.57% changes of bacterial communities in soil could be explained by environmental factors (Fig. 4a). Of these factors, soil pH was revealed as the most important environmental factor. This variable explained 10.6% of the variation in bacterial community composition (Fig. 4b) and had the closest correlation with bacterial communities in theMantel test (Table S4). Meanwhile, soil pH was positively correlated with the diversity of bacterial community (Table S3). Therefore, soil pH is the most important environmental driving factor of the variation in bacterial community, which is consistent with many other reports (P erez-de-Mora et al., 2006; Anderson et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2016).\nBesides soil pH, the concentration of available Cu, the planting of E. splendens and the content of available nutrient substrates also contributed great significance to the changes of bacterial community (Fig. 4b). The microbial composition was different under the different levels of heavy metals-pollution, which revealed the great effect of the amount of soil heavy metals on the bacterial community (Zhang et al., 2012). In addition, the soil bacterial community structures affected by the application of different amendments were similar to each other in this study, which was consistent with P erez-de-Mora et al. (2006). This might be due to the plant rhizosphere effects on soil physicochemical properties and soil microbes.\nMoreover, the bacterial community change caused by the nutrient substrates could be due to the shift in predominant microbial life-history strategies. In this study, the relative abundance of Acidobacteria, belonging to the oligotrophic (or K-selected) group (Fierer et al., 2007), displayed a negative correlation with available N content (r¼ 0.585, P¼ 0.011). And the relative abundance of Betaproteobacteria increased along with the increase in available N content (r¼ 0.711, P¼ 0.001), which is expected for members of the copiotrophic (or r-selected) group (Fierer et al., 2007). It is worth noting that plant biomass and soil nutrition were also positively correlated with bacterial diversity, but the correlationwas less than that for soil pH. Therefore, the application of amendments and the cultivation of E. splendens mainly affected the bacterial community structure by improving soil pH and nutrients."

To confirm this result, 300 bacterial strains were isolated (50 bacterial isolates per treatment) and purified on the same medium. Effects of the different amendments on the ratio of IAA- and siderophore-producing bacteria from the soil are shown in Fig. 5. The percentage of IAA-producing bacteria from the amended soils was significantly higher (ranging from 54% to 82%) than the control\nvironmental factors. (B) The percentages of variance explained by each environmental unity by Mantel test were shown. ACu, available copper; AN, available nitrogen; AP:\n(38%). In addition, a significantly higher proportion of IAAproducing bacteria from the calcium-containing materials (AS and L) treated soils was observed (78% and 82%, respectively) than that from the phosphorus-containingmaterials (AP, MHA and NHA) (ranging from 54% to 64%). In the phosphorus-containing material treatment groups, the percentage of IAA-producing bacteria in MHA treatment was slightly higher than the other two treatments (Fig. 5). Moreover, the distribution of siderophore-producing bacteria in different treatments also followed the same rule. The results confirmed that the relative abundance of potential PGPB (such as Acidovorax sp., Massilia sp. and Sphingomonas sp.) increased in the amended soils. It has been demonstrated that slow growth and low biomass for hyperaccumulators limit their efficiency of phytoremediation, but IAA- and siderophore-producing bacteria can promote plant growth (Rajkumar et al., 2012). Therefore, the application of MHA and NHA and the three conventional amendments may improve the biomass of plant and soil ecological environment by increasing the proportion of PGPB."

Therefore, these dominate bacterial populations with significant changes may be regarded as the biomarkers for the recovery of soil ecological environment, which provides a theoretical basis for the ecological evaluation of MHA/NHA.\nDeclarations of interest\nNone."
