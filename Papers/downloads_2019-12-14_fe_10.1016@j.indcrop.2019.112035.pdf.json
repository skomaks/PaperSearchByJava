CMF with average microfibers diameter of 3.5 μmwere produced by conventional alkaline and bleaching treatments with a yield of around 36 %. CNF with average nanofibrils diameter of 2.5 nm were isolated from CMF by a combination of TEMPO-oxidation and mechanical disintegration processes. The morphology and physico-chemical properties of raw Juncus plant stems, CMF, TEMPO-oxidized CMF (T-CMF) and CNF were evaluated using several characterization techniques. It was found that the applied chemical treatments were effective in producing pure CMF and CNF materials having typical cellulose I structure, high crystallinity and good thermal stability. The as-extracted CNF were utilized to develop CNF-reinforced PVA nanocomposite films, and their transparency, thermal stability and mechanical properties were investigated and compared with the CMF and T-CMF reinforced PVA composite materials. It was found that the PVA nanocomposite material containing 5 wt% CNF exhibited a tensile modulus and strength of 3.3 GPa and 110 MPa, respectively, which are higher than those observed for neat PVA and PVA composites reinforced with 5 wt% CMF or T-CMF (modulus of 1.9 and 3.1 GPa and strength of 52 and 97 MPa, respectively). In contrast to CMF and T-CMF reinforced PVA composites, that displayed a reduced optical transmittance (ca. 57–70 % at 600 nm), the CNF-reinforced PVA nanocomposite material maintained the same transmittance of the neat PVA film (ca. 90 % at 600 nm), suggesting the good dispersion of CNF at the nanometric scale. These newly developed CNF could be considered as a potential nanofiller candidate for the preparation of PVA-based nanocomposite materials of high transparency and good mechanical properties."

      "text" : "Natural fibers have gained increasing attention in the field of biodegradable composite materials owing to their abundance, lightweight, low-price, recyclability, biodegradability and environmentally friendly character (Belouadah et al., 2015; Morais et al., 2013; Sanjay et al., 2018; Vijay et al., 2019). Additionally, these materials present interesting mechanical and physical properties that have led several industries such as automotive, building and packaging to develop new composite materials containing natural fibers, in particular, lignocellulosic fibers. These are mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin and pectin, while cellulose being the main load-\nbearing component (Belouadah et al., 2015; Vijay et al., 2019). Cellulose is a homopolymer having a linear-chain composed of the repetition of anhydro-D-glucose units and has the general formula of (C6H10O5)n. Each unit contracts numerous intra and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, thus making ordered domains, which are linked together by “amorphous” domains, thus creating the fibril structure (Tayeb et al., 2018; Tayeb and Tayeb, 2019). The semi-crystalline nature of the fibrils confers them with high strength and modulus (Iwamoto et al., 2009; Saito et al., 2013). Hence, the production of fibers with high mechanical properties is achieved by eliminating noncellulosic components via various extraction processes (Belouadah et al., 2015). The obtained cellulosic fibers may have various\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.112035 Received 24 July 2019; Received in revised form 1 December 2019; Accepted 5 December 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author.

Cellulose microfibers (CMF) obtained from bleaching and alkali treatment of the cellulose source have a diameter generally of several micrometers (El Achaby et al., 2018d). CMF comprise in their cell wall cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) having a diameter of 2−20 nm and a length of few microns. CNF are extracted from CMF via a high-shear mechanical treatment. Nowadays, both CMF and CNF have been widely used as fillers in polymers in order to obtain composite materials with good quality, excellent properties and cost ratio (Sanjay et al., 2018). Although wood and cotton are the most known resources for cellulosic fibers extraction, industries are steadily looking for alternative resources to meet their demand for cellulose-based materials. In this context, the identification of new natural fibers abundant in nature, with favorable properties, is highly relevant (Belouadah et al., 2015). Up to date, several alternative sources to wood and cotton have been investigated, including annual plants such as alfa (Stipa tenacissima) and miscanthus fibers (El Achaby et al., 2018b, d; Kassab et al., 2019c), agro-industrial waste such as sugarcane bagasse, sunflower oil cake and vine shoots (El Achaby et al., 2018a, 2017; Kassab et al., 2019a, b), and marine biomass such as red algae (Bettaieb et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016; El Achaby et al., 2018c).\nJuncus effusus L, rush or smmar in Arabic, is a widespread plant belonging to Juncaceae family with about 200 species, growing in different environmental conditions, especially in wet places (lakes, rivers, ponds, mountain, etc.). The Juncus plant is in the form of a tuft of grass consisting of hollow cylindrical rods of 1 m in height and 4–8 mm in diameter containing a white spongy material. It is generally used to produce mats, baskets and other handicrafts (Hamza et al., 2013; Naili et al., 2017), while the roots and marrow parts have been used as medicinal plants in oriental medicine (Maache et al., 2017). In terms of composition, Juncus stems contains mainly 40 wt% of cellulose, 21 wt% of hemicelluloses and 29 wt% of lignin (Naili et al., 2017). Moreover, the large amount of cellulose in the Juncus stems makes it a potential source of reinforcing fibers for the composites. Therefore, it is important to develop effective strategies to value these fibers in order to make products with high added value. Recently, Hamza et al. have studied the possibility of using Juncus fibers or rush stems as a substitute for commercial fibers in building materials. They extracted Tunisian Juncus fibers by alkalization with 2.5 % of NaOH, followed by a mechanical treatment and then soaked in a 1 % acetic acid solution. Juncus fibers were found to improve the flexural strength of plasterbased composites compared to commercial plant fibers (Hamza et al., 2013). Naili et al. isolated Juncus fibers via a hot alkali treatment with a solution of 8 % NaOH, sodium hypochlorite and sodium dithionite, reaching high tensile strength and elastic modulus values (Naili et al., 2017). Maache et al. have studied the properties of Juncus effesus plant from Algeria in order to evaluate their possibility to be used as reinforcement in biocomposite materials (Maache et al., 2017).\nIn this work, cellulose microfibers (CMF), TEMPO oxidized cellulose microfibers (T-CMF), and cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) were extracted from raw Juncus plant; with the aim to develop new cellulosic derivatives to be used in composite applications and other potential applications. The CMF were prepared by alkali and bleaching treatments of raw Juncus plant, T-CMF were prepared by TEMPO-mediated oxidation of CMF, and CNF were prepared by mechanical disintegration from TCMF. The as-produced CMF, T-CMF and CNF were characterized in terms of their physico-chemical properties, and then used as reinforcing fillers for polymer nanocomposites development, using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a polymeric matrix. PVA was selected since it is a highly crystalline polymer, hydrophilic, miscible, biocompatible, non-toxic, biodegradable and has a good film-forming ability, while containing a massive hydroxyl groups on its macromolecular chains, which can be a source of hydrogen bonds with cellulose (Dai et al., 2019; El Achaby et al., 2018c)."

      "text" : "The raw Juncus plant (R-Junc) stems used in this work were collected from the province of Settat, Morocco. The collected R-Junc stems of about 125 cm in length were cut into 2−4 cm small fibers, and then they were ground using a home coffee mill (Step1, Fig. 1). The PVA polymer (47,000 MW, 98.0–98.8 mol% hydrolysis) and all the analytical grade chemicals used for extraction, purification and treatment of R-Junc cellulosic fibers were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and used without further purification.\n2.2. Treatment of R-Junc stems and extraction of cellulose microfibers (CMF)\nThe ground R-Junc were prewashed with distilled water, under mechanical stirring for 1 h at 60 °C, and then they were treated two times with 4 wt% NaOH solution at 80 °C for 2 h under mechanical stirring, resulting in alkali-treated Juncus fibers (A-Junc) (Step2, Fig. 1). Then, the as-obtained A-Junc fibers were subjected to a bleaching treatment using a solution made up of equal parts (v:v) of acetate buffer (pH 4.8) (27 g NaOH and 75 mL glacial acetic acid, diluted to 1 L of distilled water) and aqueous sodium chlorite (1.7 wt% NaClO2 in water). This treatment was done three times for 2 h at 80 °C, resulting in pure disintegrated cellulose microfibers (CMF) (Step3, Fig. 1).\n2.3. TEMPO oxidation of CMF and cellulose nanofibrils extraction\nThe obtained CMF were oxidized using TEMPO-mediated oxidation process at room temperature (23 °C), to facilitate their mechanical disintegration into cellulose nanofibrils (CNF). For that, 2 g of NaBr were solubilized in 2 L of distilled water containing a solution of NaClO. The pH of the prepared solution was adjusted to 10 by the addition of 0.1 M HCl before the addition of 320 mg of TEMPO. Then, 20 g of CMF were dispersed in the previous solution and the pH was maintained at 10 by adding 0.5 M NaOH. When no decrease in pH has been observed, the reaction was stopped. The obtained product was separated and thoroughly washed with distilled water, resulting in TEMPO-oxidized cellulose microfibers (T-CMF) (Step 4, Fig. 1). The carboxyl group content was determined at 565.48 μeq/g by the electric conductivity titration method. The obtained T-CMF were stored wet before their mechanical disintegration into CNF, which consisted in several passes\nthrough a microfluidizer M-110EH (maximum pressure 1600 bar, Microfluidics Ind., U.S.A.). A pair of 400 μm/200 μm chambers was used for the first two passes at 750 bar. Then a total of three subsequent passes were made using 200 μm/100 μm chambers at 1500 bar. The choice of pressure has been made according to the following works (Fillat et al., 2018; Sehaqui et al., 2011). This process resulted in the production of CNF in gel form (Step5, Fig. 1). The solid content of the obtained CNF gel was 1.38 wt%.\n2.4. Preparation of composite films\nCMF, T-CMF and CNF derived from R-Junc stems were incorporated into PVA polymer to produce composite materials reinforced with naturally micro-sized cellulose fibers (case of CMF), surface oxidized cellulose fibers (case of T-CMF) and nano-sized cellulose fibers (case of CNF). The composite materials were prepared by the solvent casting technique and the weight fraction of each cellulosic filler was fixed at 5 wt%. For that, PVA powder was dissolved in distilled water for 1 h at 95 °C under mechanical stirring, and then cooled to room temperature. At the same time, an aqueous suspension containing 5 wt% of CMF, T-CMF or CNF was prepared and ultrasonicated for 5 min and added to PVA solution. Afterward, the mixed solution was mechanically stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the obtained mixture was poured onto large petri dishes (120 × 120 mm²) and air-dried in laboratory hood at room temperature for 72 h to evaporate the water, resulting in the production of 80-μm-thick films with high quality, smooth surface and good flexibility. Neat PVA film was also prepared according to the same process but without the addition of cellulosic fibers. The produced composite films were referred as follows: PVA, PVA/CMF, PVA/T-CMF and PVA/CNF for neat PVA film and PVA composite film containing 5 wt% CMF, T-CMF or CNF, respectively."

      "text" : "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HIROX SH 4000 M) was used to evaluate the morphologies of the cellulosic samples and the thickness of PVA-based composite films. For that, the samples were coated by a thin conductive carbon layer to help improve SEM images. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco Dimension ICON) was employed to evaluate the morphology and dimensions of the extracted CNF. An aqueous suspension of approximately 0.01 wt % CNF was dispersed by ultrasonic bath for 15 min and then deposited on a mica sheet for AFM observation. CNF dimensions were measured using Veeco Data Analysis Software. Infrared spectra of all samples were recorded at a spectral width ranging from 4000 to 600 cm−1, using FTIR spectrometry (Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 2000) equipped with ATR accessory. The crystalline structure and the crystallinity index of cellulosic samples were identified by X-ray diffractometer (D2 PHASER diffractometer) using a monochromatic CuK radiation at λ = 1.54056 Å (40 kV, 40 mA) in the range of 2θ = 5-50° with a scanning rate of 2°/min. The crystallinity index (CrI) was calculated according to the Segal equation (Segal et al., 1959): = ×−CrI 100I II am200 200\n. Where I200 is the intensity of the 200-lattice plane at around 2θ = 22.8°, and Iam is the intensity from the amorphous phase at approximately 2θ = 18° (El Achaby et al., 2018b; Segal et al., 1959).\nThe thermal stability was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Discovery TGA from TA instruments). Samples of ca. 5−10 mg were heated to 700 °C under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The optical transmittance level of PVA-based composite films was evaluated by ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy measurements (PerkinElmer LAMBDA 1050 spectrophotometer). The film samples were placed directly in the spectrophotometer test cell, and the air was used as a reference. The optical transmittance of the films was measured in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm. Tensile tests for PVA-based composite films were performed at room temperature using\na universal testing machine (LUDWIG mpk). The specimens were cut in rectangular shapes with 80 mm in length and 10 mm in width. The gauge length was fixed at 30 mm and the crosshead speed was 5 mm/ min. All tests were carried out on a minimum of three samples and the reported results are average values."

      "text" : "3.1. Purification of R-Junc and production of CMF, T-CMF and CNF\nR-Junc stems were converted into pure micro- and nano-cellulosic fibers with different characteristics and dimensions using chemical and mechanical treatments, namely alkali and bleaching treatments followed by mechanical disintegration. Such alkali and bleaching treatments resulted in the production of pure cellulose microfibers (CMF) with a yield of 36 % in comparison to the initial weight of R-Junc stems. The quality of the as-extracted CMF and its extraction yield are comparable to CMF extracted from other well-known bio-sourced materials such as sugarcane bagasse, alfa fibers and miscanthus fibers (El Achaby et al., 2018b, d; El Miri et al., 2015b). This finding suggests that R-Junc plant is a viable and sustainable source for CMF production. The asobtained CMF were successfully converted into cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) in order to obtain nanosized cellulose with a high aspect ratio and large specific area. For that, it was necessary to oxidize the surface of CMF to help the separation of fibers and to facilitate the mechanical disintegration of CNF. To achieve this treatment, CMF were subjected to TEMPO oxidation process, which resulted in TEMPO-oxidized CMF (TCMF). This treatment resulted into the insertion of negatively charged carboxyl groups onto CMF surface, which helps their fibrillation throughout the repulsion mechanism (El-Gendy et al., 2017). The carboxyl groups' content of T-CMF was determined to be 565 μeq/g, confirming that the oxidation process was successfully achieved. At the end, T-CMF suspension was passed several times through a microfluidizer at high pressure to produce a transparent CNF gel with a solid content of 1.38 wt%. The CNF suspension was highly stable compared to CMF and T-CMF suspensions, as shown in Fig. 2."

      "text" : "SEM observations (Fig. 3) were performed to evaluate the morphology, surface features and the dimensions of the R-Junc stems and its chemically treated parts (A-Junc, CMF and T-CMF). SEM image of the transverse section of R-Junc stem is shown in Fig. 3a, confirming the\npreservation of cell structure and the homogenization of cell walls. This later consists of typical xylem tissue made up of primary cells, also called tracheids, with pits located in radial walls (Jiang et al., 2018). The cell wall structure is composed of cellulose fibers connected to each other via lignin, hemicelluloses, pectin and other non-cellulosic materials, playing the role of cement and giving a compact structure to the material (El Achaby et al., 2018a; Jiang et al., 2018; Maache et al., 2017). However, the chemical treatments (alkali and bleaching treatments) led to obvious differences in the morphology (Fig. 3b–d). Following the alkali-treatment, parts of the cementing components are removed, undergoing slight fibrillation of the fiber bundles (Maache et al., 2017; Naili et al., 2017), as shown in Fig. 3b.\nFurthermore, the bleaching treatment was effective in completely removing the hemicelluloses and lignin content, resulting in individual microfibers with a smoother surface and regular diameter (Fig. 3b,c). The average diameter of CMF was determined at 3.5± 1.3 μm, which is smaller than that determined for CMF extracted from other sources using the same chemical treatment (El Achaby et al., 2018a, d; Mikulcová et al., 2018; Oun and Rhim, 2016; Szymanska-Chargot et al., 2017). Moreover, better fibrillation of microfibers was observed in TCMF morphology after the TEMPO oxidation process, which resulted in the formation of gaps between the microfibers due to the insertion of negatively charged carboxylate groups on the microfiber surface (ElGendy et al., 2017). The average diameter of T-CMF was determined at 3.2± 1.2 μm, which is comparable to that measured for CMF (3.5± 1.3 μm) without surface oxidation, confirming that the structure\nof CMF was maintained by the oxidation process."

      "text" : "Due to the nanometric size of the produced CNF, its morphology and dimensions were determined by AFM observations. The obtained highand low-magnification AFM images are shown in Fig. 4, and the average diameter of the extracted CNF was determined by analyzing the height profiles using Veeco Data Analysis Software and reported in Table 1. AFM observation revealed that the extracted CNF consisted of mostly individualized nanosized fibers with an average diameter of about 2.5±1.3 nm and few microns in length, indicating that CNF were successfully obtained with a high aspect ratio. The length could not be determined due to the intrinsic alignment and formation of entangled network of the nanofibrils (El-Gendy et al., 2017).\nIn contrast with the literature, the obtained CNF diameter was smaller compared to CNF extracted from other sources, as summarized in Table 2. CNF diameter depends on several parameters among which the time and intensity of the TEMPO-oxidation process (Van Hai et al., 2018). Besides that, the temperature, pH value, pressure level, chambers size and number of passes in the microfluidizer or homogenizer and the nature of raw material could influence the size of CNF (Table 2). Nevertheless, since TEMPO-oxidation results in individualized fibrils, we can conclude that the CNF in the R-Junc stem are comparable to those of wood, but narrower in comparison to other sources such as cladophore algae having a diameter of the microfibrils\nof 10−20 nm (Štefelová et al., 2017)."

      "text" : "Fig. 5a shows the FTIR spectra of all studied cellulosic samples (RJunc, A-Junc, CMF, T-CMF and CNF). All samples exhibit broadband\nbetween 3515 cm−1 and 3164 cm-1, corresponding to the stretching vibration of hydrogen bond OHe (Belouadah et al., 2015; Maache et al., 2017), which may also refer to the crystalline structure of cellulose Iβ (Naili et al., 2017). Commonly, all samples show the characteristic bands of cellulose structure. For instance, the band at 2895 cm-1 was associated to CH stretching vibration from CH and CH2 in cellulose\n(Belouadah et al., 2015; Maache et al., 2017; Naili et al., 2017). The observed bands at 1414 cm−1 and 1366 cm-1 could be associated to the CH2 symmetric bending groups of cellulose (Belouadah et al., 2015; Maache et al., 2017). In addition, the bands observed in all samples between 1100 cm-1 and 899 cm-1 could be assigned to the presence of βglucosidic ether linkages (CeOCe) related to the vibration modes of anhydro-glucopyranose ring skeleton, and to the β-glycosidic linkages between the anhydroglucose rings in the cellulose (Belouadah et al., 2015; El Achaby et al., 2018c; Maache et al., 2017). The band at 669 cm-1 can be assigned to the out of plane vibrations involving ring structures (Maache et al., 2017). As could be observed in Fig. 5a, the intensity of these bands increased after cellulose purification treatments. For R-Junc, peaks at 1729 cm-1 and at 1251 cm-1 were attributed to the carbonyl C]O stretching of the acetyl groups of lignin and hemicelluloses (Belouadah et al., 2015; El Achaby et al., 2018d; Maache et al., 2017; Naili et al., 2017), and the band at 1242 cm-1 is associated to (−COO) groups of hemicelluloses (Belouadah et al., 2015). However, these bands were not detected in the spectra of the purified cellulosic fibers (CMF, T-CMF and CNF), which confirm the total elimination of lignin and hemicelluloses after treatment of R-Junc (El Achaby et al., 2018d; Mikulcová et al., 2018). Remarkably, the intensity of the band at 1600 cm-1 increased for T-CMF and CNF, indicating the presence of C]O stretching vibration of −COONa, generated from the TEMPO oxidation process (Huang et al., 2018). Therefore, the results of FTIR are in good agreement with the literature, which proves the successful oxidation of CMF and the extraction of CNF."

The XRD patterns of R-Junc, A-Junc, CMF, T-CMF and CNF samples are represented in Fig. 5b, and the calculated CrI is summarized in Table 1. All studied samples showed the main crystalline peaks of cellulose structure I, which is characterized by the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 15.0, 16, 22.5 and 34.7° corresponding to the crystallographic plans of (110), (101), (200) and (004), respectively (Belouadah et al., 2015; El Achaby et al., 2018b; Maache et al., 2017). These results confirm that the R-Junc stems can be classified as a lignocellulosic material and its cellulosic structure was not affected by the applied chemo-mechanical treatments. The crystallinity index was calculated at 47 %, 62 %, 75 %, 81 %, and 64 % for R-Junc, A-Junc, CMF, T-CMF and CNF, respectively (Table 1).\nThe R-Junc stems exhibit a compact structure in which the cellulose fibers are embedded in a matrix of amorphous components such as hemicelluloses and lignin; thus, a relatively low CrI (47 %) is shown. The CrI is gradually increased from 47 % for R-Junc to 75 % for CMF, indicating the successive removal of the amorphous components during the chemical treatment, as confirmed by SEM and FTIR analysis (Figs. 3 and 5a). In addition, it could be observed that the cellulose structure was retained after the introduction of carboxyl groups by TEMPOmediated oxidation. Indeed, T-CMF sample showed a CrI of 81 % which is higher than that measured for CMF, indicating that the T-CMF exhibits a highly ordered crystalline structure (Zhao et al., 2017). After the mechanical disintegration of T-CMF, the as-produced CNF showed a reduced CrI. It was previously confirmed that the mechanical\nprocessing of cellulose can cause damage to crystals, resulting in reduced crystallinity (Xiang et al., 2016). In our case, it was found that the CrI decreased from 81 % for T-CMF to 64 % for CNF, suggesting that further studies should be done in order to optimize the pressure and the number of passes through the microfluidizer to produce CNF with high crystallinity."

The onset temperatures (Tonset) of R-Junc, A-Junc and CMF samples were observed at 215.9, 254.5 and 270.6 °C, and the thermal degradation was performed at one step with a maximum temperature (Tmax) of 322.4, 335.1 and 354.3 °C, respectively. The increased Tonset of CMF is due to the removal of lignin and hemicelluloses that are characterized by low thermal degradation. Similar results have been reported in the literature for CMF extraction from other sources (El Achaby et al., 2018c, d; El Miri et al., 2015b; Meng et al., 2019; Ng et al., 2015; Oun and Rhim, 2016). On the other hand, T-CMF and CNF samples showed reduced thermal stability and the degradation was occurred at two steps with two maximum degradation temperatures (Tmax1 and Tmax2). The Tonset was observed at 211.1 and 204.6 °C for T-CMF and CNF which are lower than that observed for CMF sample, indicating that the surface oxidation of T-CMF and CNF has a clear effect on their thermal degradation. The Tmax1 and Tmax2 were observed at 234.7 and 295.5 °C for T-CMF, and at 235.1 and 286.7 °C for CNF, which are due to the decarbonation of the sodium carboxylate groups introduced during the TEMPO-oxidation, and the degradation of the main cellulose structure, respectively (Fukuzumi et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2018; Isogai et al., 2011). This finding is in accordance with previously reported results (Du et al., 2016; Fukuzumi et al., 2010; Sharma et al., 2017). Further, a char residue at 600 °C of 25.5, 21.5, 10.3, 27.6, 26.7 % for R-Junc, AJunc, CMF, T-CMF and CNF samples was observed. The residual char of cellulosic samples degradation contain carbon residues (Maache et al., 2017). The T-CMF and CNF samples showed the higher carbon residue yield due to the preferred dehydration reaction at low temperature. Moreover, the reduced dimensions of T-CMF and CNF accelerate their decomposition at lower thermal energy (Du et al., 2016).\n3.7.

Neat PVA shows bands at 3290 cm−1, 2987 cm−1, 1478 cm−1, 1088 cm−1, 917 cm−1 and 838 cm−1, assigned to the stretching and bending vibrations of hydroxyl group (−OH), asymmetric stretching vibration of methylene group (CH2), stretching of −CH, rocking of −CH, bending of −CH2 and stretching of CeO, respectively (Bian et al., 2018; El Achaby et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2013; Solikhin and Murayama, 2018). While, the vibrational band observed at 1743 cm−1 corresponds to carbonyl functional bond (C]O) of residual acetate groups remaining after the preparation of PVA from hydrolysis of poly(vinyl acetate) (Mallakpour et al., 2015). The band at approximately 1124 cm-1 corresponds to CeO stretching, and that at about 1780 cm-1 to C]O stretching of the unhydrolyzed ester functional group present in PVA backbone (El Achaby\net al., 2017; Solikhin and Murayama, 2018). FTIR spectra of PVA composite films exhibited in general the same bands as those found in the neat PVA, as shown in Fig. 6a. Owing to the relatively low content of CMF, T-CMF and CNF (5 wt%) within the PVA composite films, all the cellulosic bands were overlapped with those of PVA. Importantly, the FTIR spectra illustrated the presence of CMF, TCMF and CNF demonstrated by some characteristic bands at 1034 cm−1 and 1057 cm-1. These bands were associated with the vibration stretch of CeOH bonds in secondary and primary alcohols of cellulose, respectively. This might demonstrate the expected interaction of hydroxyl groups of PVA matrix with the hydrophilic surfaces of cellulosic fillers (Bian et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2013). Bands at 1566 cm-1 and 1659 cm-1 are observed in all spectra of the tested films, which indicate the presence of HeOHe deformation groups of both PVA and cellulose. However, the inclusion of cellulosic fibers decreased the intensity of those bands, indicating the interfacial interaction between PVA and the fillers (Solikhin and Murayama, 2018).\n3.8. Optical transparency of composite films\nFig. 6b illustrates the optical transmittance level of the PVA composite films filled with CMF, T-CMF and CNF. It is well known that the neat PVA film is characterized by a high transparency level in the visible light region (transmittance of 90 %) (El Achaby et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2013). However, the incorporation of micro-cellulosic fillers (CMF and T-CMF) resulted in a clear decrease in the transparency level of PVA composite films, and the large decrease in transparency level is more pronounced for CMF filler (transmittance of 57 %). This may be related to the tendency of CMF to agglomerate within PVA polymer, due to its micrometric scale and its unfunctionalized surface, preventing a good dispersion within PVA polymer (Solikhin and Murayama, 2018). In contrast, a transmittance of 70 % was measured for PVA composite film containing T-CMF filler, demonstrating that the surface functionalization of T-CMF helped their dispersion within PVA polymer, but their micrometric scale could favorize the scattering of the visible light, hence a reduced transparency was observed for PVA/TCMF composite film in comparison to the neat PVA film. Interestingly, the PVA/CNF composite film maintained the same transparency level of the neat PVA film, due to the CNF dispersion at the nanometric scale. Herein, the smaller size of CNF (2.5 nm in diameter) and their functionalized surface (carboxylated surface) helped their good dispersion within PVA matrix throughout a good interfacial interaction between the functionalized surface of CNF and the macromolecular chains of PVA, thus no scattering and/or absorbance difference were found between the neat PVA polymer and PVA/CNF composite (El Miri et al., 2015a; Huang et al., 2018). In this case, the as-developed PVA/CNF composite could be referred as nanocomposite materials. From this data, these newly developed CNF could be considered as a potential candidate as a nanofiller for the preparation of high transparency PVAbased nanocomposite materials.\n3.9. Thermal stability of composite films\nThe thermal degradation behavior of the as-produced PVA composite films was evaluated by TGA/DTG analysis, and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 6c,d. The TGA curves revealed that the thermal decomposition behavior of the PVA composite films is similar to that of the neat PVA film and displays three noticeable weight loss steps. The first degradation step at about 100 °C is related to the evaporation of physically weak and chemically strong bound water (Zhang et al., 2018). While, the second weight loss at around 300 °C is related to the polymer dehydration process and the partly thermal decomposition of the cellulosic fillers, as observed in Fig. 5c,d. Finally, the third weight loss observed at around 430 °C is due to the decomposition of polymer main chains for both structural PVA matrix chains and cellulosic reinforcements with almost no products left (7–8 % of inorganic residue)Ta bl e 2 C ha ra ct er is ti cs of C N F pr ep ar ed\nus in g th e TE\nM PO\n/N aB\nr/ N aC\nlO sy st em\nin w at er\nan d/\nor m ec ha\nni ca l di si nt eg\nra ti on\n.\nSo ur ce\npH T (° C )\nO xi da\nti on\nti m e\nM ic ro fl ui di za ti on\nD ia m et er\n(n m )\nLe ng th (μ m )\nC ar bo\nxy la te\nco nt en t (μ m ol /g\n) R ef er en\nce\nEu ca ly pt us\npu lp\n10 –\nU nt il no\nde cr ea se\nin pH\nw as\nob se rv ed\nM ic ro fl ui di ze r, 1 pa\nss us in g 20\n0 μm\nch am\nbe r at\n70 0 ba\nr, 1 pa\nss us in g 20\n0 μm\nch am\nbe r at\n12 00\nba r, th en\n1 pa\nss us in g 20\n0 μm\n/1 00\nμm ch\nam be\nrs at\n15 00\nba r\n1 ±\n0. 25\n0. 25\n-0 .6 0\n77 8\n(F ill at\net al ., 20\n18 )\nO liv\ne tr ee\npr un\nin g re si du\ne 10\n– U nt il no\nde cr ea se\nin pH\nw as\nob se rv ed\nM ic ro fl ui di ze r, 1 pa\nss us in g 20\n0 μm\nch am\nbe r at\n70 0 ba\nr, 1 pa\nss us in g 20\n0 μm\nch am\nbe r at\n12 00\nba r, th en\n1 pa\nss us in g 20\n0 μm\n/1 00\nμm ch\nam be\nrs at\n15 00\nba r\n2. 35\n± 0. 55\n1- 1. 6\n10 38\n(F ill at\net al ., 20\n18 )\nBl ea ch\ned Ju nc us\nfi be\nrs 10\n25 U nt il no\nde cr ea se\nin pH\nw as\nob se rv ed\nM ic ro fl ui di ze r,\n2 pa\nss es\nus in g 40\n0 μm\n/2 00\nμm ch\nam be\nrs at\n75 0 ba\nr, th en 3 pa ss es us in g 20 0 μm /1 00 μm ch am be rs at 15 00 ba r\n2. 5 ±\n1. 3\nfe w\nm ic ro ns\n56 5\nTh is\nw or\nk\nkr af t pu\nlp 10\n25 –\nTr ea tm\nen t w it h so di um\nch lo ri te\nin ac et at e bu\nff er\nat pH\n4– 5 an\nd ro om\nte m pe\nra tu re\nfo r 2 da\nys 4\n50 0\n13 00\n-1 72\n0 (H\nua ng\net al ., 20\n18 )\nSo ft w oo\nd su lp hi te\npu lp\nfi be\nrs 10\n– –\nM ic ro fl ui di ze r\n5 −\n10 50\n0 23\n00 (S eh\naq ui\net al ., 20\n12 )\nH ar dw\noo d bl ea ch\ned su lp hi te\nce llu\nlo se\npu lp\n– –\n– H om\nog en\niz er , 5 pa\nss es\nus in g 20\n0 μm\n/1 00\nμm ch\nam be\nrs at\n17 24\nba r\n5- 15\n– 10\n63 (O\nny ia nt a et\nal .,\n20 18\na, b)\nSo ft w oo\nd pu\nlp 10\n25 60\nm in\nH om\nog en\niz er , 6 ti m es\nat 80\n0 ba\nr 5- 20\n0. 5- 2\n– (Y\nan g et\nal ., 20\n19 )\nBl ea ch\ned eu\nca ly pt us\nK ra ft\npu lp\n– 60\n48 h\nM ic ro fl ui di ze r,\n15 pa\nss es\nus in g 20\n0 μm\n/8 7 μm\nch am\nbe rs\nat 15\n00 ba\nr 5. 7 ±\n0. 7\nse ve\nra l m ic ro ns\n46 0\n(Q in g et\nal ., 20\n13 )\nTu ni ca te\npu lp\n10 55\n1 h\nH om\nog en\niz er ,1\npa ss\nus in g 40\n0 μm\n/2 00\nμm ch\nam be\nrs at\n92 5 ba\nr, th en\n4 pa\nss es\nus in g 20\n0 μm\n/1 00\nμm ch\nam be\nrs at\n16 00\nba r\n8. 55\n± 3. 37\n2. 04\n± 0. 84\n42 8\n(Z ha\no et\nal ., 20\n17 )\nH ar dw\noo d bl ea ch\ned su lp hi te\nce llu\nlo se\npu lp\n– –\n1 h\nM ic ro fl ui di ze r,\n5 pa\nss es\nus in g 20\n0 μm\n/1 00\nμm ch\nam be\nrs at\n17 24\nba r\n9 ±\n2 –\n50 0–\n15 00\n(O ny\nia nt a et\nal .,\n20 18\na, b)\nBl ea ch\ned Pa\nlm tr ee\n10 4\n12 0 m in\nH om\nog en\niz er , 15\nti m es\nat 60\n00 ba\nr 10\n–1 8\n0. 11\n-0 .1 4\n77 4\n(H am\nou et\nal ., 20\n18 )\nBl ea ch\ned Pa\nlm tr ee\n10 4\n5 m in\nH om\nog en\niz er , 15\nti m es\nat 60\n00 ba\nr 20\n-4 0\n0. 5- 0. 6\n22 1\n(H am\nou et\nal ., 20\n18 )\n(El Achaby et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2013; Mallakpour et al., 2015; Solikhin and Murayama, 2018). The maximum decomposition temperature corresponding to the maximum weight loss (Tmax) of neat PVA and its composites with CMF, T-CMF and CNF was determined from DTG curves at 270, 268, 273 and 277 °C, respectively. Remarkably, a slight shift towards high temperature was observed when T-CMF and CNF were incorporated. This slight increase in the thermal stability of PVA/T-CMF and PVA/CNF composites is due to the interfacial interaction between the PVA macromolecular chains with functionalized surface of T-CMF and CNF fillers, resulting in the restriction of the polymer chains mobility at the PVA-filler interfaces, improving in turn the thermal stability of the resulted PVA composite films.\n3.10. Mechanical properties of PVA composite films\nThe application of the as-developed micro- and nano-cellulose fibers for improving the mechanical properties of polymers was tested in this work. The mechanical properties of the as-prepared PVA composites filled with CMF, T-CMF and CNF were investigated by the tensile tests. Fig. 7a shows the obtained stress-strain curves, from which the young’s modulus, the tensile strength and the elongation at break were evaluated and compared (Fig. 7b–d). The percentage of decrease/increase of these mechanical parameters is illustrated in Table 3. It was found that the young’s modulus, the tensile strength and the elongation at\nbreak were largely decreased when 5 wt% CMF was incorporated. A decrease by 25 %, 28 % and 79 %, respectively, was detected, which is caused by the micrometric size of CMF, their non-homogenous dispersion/distribution and their tendency to agglomerate within PVA polymer, which is consistent with the transparency level mentioned above (Fig. 6b). Thus, PVA composite film with unsmooth surface and low transparency, and with weak physical and chemical interaction between CMF and PVA could be produced with lower mechanical properties with regards to unfilled PVA film (Solikhin and Murayama, 2018). In contrast, a different trend was observed when 5 wt% T-CMF was incorporated. In fact, a remarkable increase of young’s modulus (23 %) and tensile strength (40 %) was determined, while the elongation at break was largely decreased by 82 %. Compared to CMF filler, T-CMF showed a better reinforcing performance due to the surface functionalization of microfibers which provides a better wettability and bonding between the T-CMF surface and the PVA matrix (Vijay et al., 2019).\nInterestingly, the CNF nanofiller demonstrated a high reinforcing ability than that determined for CMF and T-CMF microfillers. For PVA/ CNF composite (or nanocomposite), the young’s modulus, the tensile strength and the elongation at break were simultaneously increased by 37 %, 60 % and 90 %, respectively, compared to neat PVA film. In this case, the reinforcement effect could be attributed to the nanometric scale of CNF, its high aspect ratio and its functionalized surface, which are responsible for a good nanoscale dispersion and strong interfacial\ninteractions between the PVA macromolecular chains and the surface of nanofibrils, thereby allowing a significant improvement of the mechanical properties of the resulted PVA/CNF composite film (Huang et al., 2018; Kwak et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2019)."

      "text" : "Juncus plant has been used, for the first time, for the extraction of micro- and nano-cellulosic fibers having various morphologies and surface functionalities. Cellulose microfibers (CMF) have been produced via an alkali and bleaching treatments of the raw Juncus stems,\nwhich provided 3.5 μm wide microfibers. TEMPO-oxidation of CMF resulted in oxidized CMF (T-CMF) with almost similar morphology, but with a surface functionalized with carboxylate groups. Mechanical disintegration of T-CMF leaded carboxylated CNF with a diameter of only 2.5 nm. In comparison to the crystallinity of raw Juncus stems, all the extracted cellulosic materials (CMF, T-CMF and CNF) displayed a higher crystallinity index as a result of the removal of the amorphous components (e.g., hemicelluloses and lignin), while all samples have the crystalline structure of cellulose I. The small diameter of CNF and its negatively charged surfaces enhance its dispersion in various media. It was found that CNF have excellent colloidal stability in water, in contrast to CMF that flocculate in water. CNF dispersion in PVA matrix resulted in optically transparent composite film suggesting a good dispersion of the CNF nanofiller. Such good dispersion of CNF in the PVA translates into improved mechanical properties in comparison to the properties of neat PVA polymer and PVA composites containing CMF or T-CMF. Tensile strength and modulus of 110 MPa and 3.3 GPa, respectively, were reached for the nanocomposite comprising 5 wt% CNF, and this is much better than the 70 MPa and 2.4 GPa of the neat PVA matrix. These newly developed CNF could be considered as a potential nanofiller candidate for the preparation of PVA-based nanocomposite materials of high transparency and good mechanical properties.\nFunding\nNone.\nAuthor contributions\nZineb Kassab: Collected the data, Performed the analysis, Other contribution.\nSaid Mansouri: Contributed data or analysis tools, Performed the analysis.\nYoussef Tamraoui: Collected the data, Performed the analysis.

    "abstractText" : "With the aim of identifying new, renewable and sustainable sources for the production of bio-nano-materials, cellulose microfibers (CMF) and cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) were successfully produced from the widely available Juncus plant. CMF with average microfibers diameter of 3.5 μmwere produced by conventional alkaline and bleaching treatments with a yield of around 36 %. CNF with average nanofibrils diameter of 2.5 nm were isolated from CMF by a combination of TEMPO-oxidation and mechanical disintegration processes. The morphology and physico-chemical properties of raw Juncus plant stems, CMF, TEMPO-oxidized CMF (T-CMF) and CNF were evaluated using several characterization techniques. It was found that the applied chemical treatments were effective in producing pure CMF and CNF materials having typical cellulose I structure, high crystallinity and good thermal stability. The as-extracted CNF were utilized to develop CNF-reinforced PVA nanocomposite films, and their transparency, thermal stability and mechanical properties were investigated and compared with the CMF and T-CMF reinforced PVA composite materials. It was found that the PVA nanocomposite material containing 5 wt% CNF exhibited a tensile modulus and strength of 3.3 GPa and 110 MPa, respectively, which are higher than those observed for neat PVA and PVA composites reinforced with 5 wt% CMF or T-CMF (modulus of 1.9 and 3.1 GPa and strength of 52 and 97 MPa, respectively). In contrast to CMF and T-CMF reinforced PVA composites, that displayed a reduced optical transmittance (ca. 57–70 % at 600 nm), the CNF-reinforced PVA nanocomposite material maintained the same transmittance of the neat PVA film (ca. 90 % at 600 nm), suggesting the good dispersion of CNF at the nanometric scale. These newly developed CNF could be considered as a potential nanofiller candidate for the preparation of PVA-based nanocomposite materials of high transparency and good mechanical properties.",
