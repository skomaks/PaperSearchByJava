      "text" : "Unconventional properties of low-dimensional water confined in narrow channels have relevance in diverse fields, like materials science, geology, biology, nanotechnology [1] etc. Following the excitement on newly discovered allotropes of carbon, e.g. carbon nanotubes and graphene, these materials have been used as templates to harness and study low dimensional water. The structure and phase behaviour of water inside hydrophobic confinements like carbon nanotubes [2, 3], graphene nano-slits [4], graphene oxide membranes [5] and graphene bi-layers [6], or purely hydrophilic confinements like zeolites [7], nano porous silicates [8] and titania surfaces [9, 10, 11] have been studied.\nOn the other hand, attempts have been made to bring the emerging material system of graphene in contact with another important class of materials, namely transition metal oxides (TMO), which form attractive application possibilities[12, 13, 14, 15]. In particular, graphene supported on TiO2 has been considered in many such applications e.g., gated graphene-on-TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 (STO) field effect transistor has been successfully fabricated and characterized [16, 17]. In such devices ferroelectric-like surface dipoles on TiO2 surface of STO, formed due to off-centric movement of Ti atoms, are found to give rise to large intrinsic polarization which gets probed by graphene [17]. A complete understanding of the synergistic interaction between graphene and TMO is necessary to broaden the potential applications of graphene/TMO heterostructures. Since wet chemical methods are used to synthesize these heterostructures, graphene-TMO interaction is mediated by the water trapped in the process [18]. Water mediated interactions have also been shown to play key roles in diffusion and transport characteristics of guest molecules within narrow confinements, with important implications for microfluidic [19] and drug delivery applications [20]. It is, therefore, crucially important to understand the static and dynamic behaviour of trapped water.\nWe note that the TiO2 surface is polar (hydrophilic) and graphene is non-polar (hydrophobic), giving rise to an asymmetric confinement, the situation being different from the symmetric confinements mostly considered so far [3, 4, 5, 8, 9]. There have been reports [21, 22] on properties of asymmetrically confined water. However, the relaxation dynamics of water within such confinements has remained unexplored to a large extent to the best of our knowledge. Experimentally, a noisy frequencydependent shear response for asymmetrically confined water has been reported [23]. The observed behaviour has been attributed to the competing tendencies of water to wet the hydrophilic surface and de-wet the hydrophobic one. These observations have been supported by theoretical studies primarily focused on the structure of water under such asymmetric confinement [24]. However, the dynamic behaviour at microscopic level within such confinements has not been understood.\nWe employ force-field molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to study the dynamics of water confined in an asymmetric slit geometry, consisting of a graphene over-layer at the TiO2 terminated (001) STO surface at room temperature. We focus on the strong confinement limit where the effects of both confining surfaces are experienced by water molecules in the slit. It is observed that the strongly pinned water layer at the STO surface shields the rest of water in the slit from hydrophilic effects of the surface. The translational and rotational dynamics of water molecules show heterogeneity due to coupling of slow relaxing and strongly pinned hydration layer over STO surface, with faster subsequent water layers.

      "text" : "For modelling water interactions at oxide surfaces it is important to consider polarisation effects. However, polarisable water models have been shown to under-predict transport properties and over-predict orientational order of water in confinement [25], while non-polarisable models yield better results. With charge scaling and proper treatment of electrostatic interactions, rigid models yield correct electrostatic solvation energies, and explicitly accounting for polarization becomes important only for low polar solvents like ethers [26]. In a comparative bench-marking [27] of non-polarisable water models, the TIP4P model has been shown to give the best overall predictions of water properties under different thermodynamic conditions. Hence, we employ the TIP4P-ew [28] water model in which the effects of polarisation are included in an implicit fashion, and we use the shake algorithm [29] to restrain the water bond lengths and bond angles. This model is optimised for use with the Ewald summation technique of treating long range electrostatic interactions, and has been shown to accurately reproduce water properties over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions [30].\nCarbon-carbon and graphene-water interactions are modelled following the prescriptions in [31]. For modelling the STO lattice and STO-water interactions, we use force-field parameters reported in [32]. This set developed from fitting to experimental properties and results of ab-initio calculations, has been shown to accurately predict properties of STO-water interface [32, 33]. Ion-ion interactions in the STO slab follow the Buckingham potential:\nUBH(rij) = Aijexp ( −rij bij ) − Cij r6ij , (1)\nwhile the water-water, water-STO and water-graphene interactions are of the Lennard Jones (LJ) type:\nULJ(rij) = 4 ij [( σij rij )12 − ( σij rij )6] ≡ A ′ r12 − C ′ r6ij .

The entire box is repeated periodically in all three spatial directions.

The graphene layer of same dimensions, placed parallel to the STO surface at a separation h, is equally restrained by a harmonic potential of force constant 1000kJ/mol nm−2, so that during the simulation, the volume of the confinement does not fluctuate widely. Simulations are performed for different values of the confinement width h ranging from 1 nm to 5 nm at constant temperature of 300K and constant volume, using the Gromacs-4.6.5 software package [34] .\nAtomic pair A′ij(kJmol −1 Å12) C ′ij(kJmol −1Å6) Sr-Ow 816491.0 0.00 Ti-Ow 54262.9 0.00 OslbOw 2479730 3502.40 C - Ow 1104288.91 998.39\nWithin nanometre size confinements, the effective volume accessible to water molecules is smaller than the total available geometric volume .

      "text" : "Structure of confined water– We start with the density profile of water in this asymmetric nanoconfinement on which our dynamical studies have been carried out. Perpendicular to the surface of a single graphene or STO, water molecules show density variations which extend up to a distance of thrice the molecular diameter (∼ 1 nm) from the surface (Figure 2(a)). We primarily focus on the confinement where the two confining surfaces are separated by twice this distance or less. This we define as the strong confinement limit, as the effects of the asymmetry of the confining surfaces are expected to be strong for such slits. Figure 2(b) shows density profiles of water in 1 nm wide symmetric (graphene-graphene and STO-STO) and asymmetric (STO-graphene) nano-slits. It is observed that two symmetrically placed graphene walls repel water molecules to create a double peaked structure of water, while two symmetric STO walls create two strongly adsorbed layers in their vicinity. When one of the STO walls is replaced by graphene, the density in the layer close to graphene (LG, between z0 and z1) gets depleted compared to that in the symmetric graphene confinement. As a result, an additional layer appears in the middle (LM, between z1 and z2), along with a strongly adsorbed layer (LS, between z2 and z3) near STO surface, similar to that in the symmetric STO confinement. In effect, the hydrophobicity of graphene gets enhanced by the proximity of STO. At the same time, the hydrophilicity of STO wall gets screened by the adsorbed water layer in its vicinity as observed earlier for water on metal surface [35]. This makes the slit effectively hydrophobic, bounded by the hydrated STO and the graphene surface.\nStrong orientational ordering is observed in LS as shown in the inset of Figure 2(b). The dipole moment vectors of water molecules within this layer tend to align preferentially at angles of θ = 0o, 110o and 150o to the STO surface normal. In LM the preferred orientation is θ = 60o, while in LG no preferred orientation of the water molecules is observed. Having an understanding of the structure, we next probe the translational and rotational dynamical properties of the water layers.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\npt ed\nM an\nip t\nDynamics of Water Trapped in Transition metal oxide-Graphene Nano-confinement6\nTime Correlation functions – The dynamics of water layers are characterized through the analysis of various time correlation functions Cξ(t) ( ξ = T and R for translation and rotation, respectively). Let us first consider the residence time, defined through the correlation function,\nCT (t) =\n〈 1\nNl(t0) N∑ i=1 ( t0+t∏ t′=t0 Θi(t ′) )〉 t0 , (3)\nwhere Θi(t ′) = 1 if za ≤ zi(t′) < zb and 0, otherwise. za and zb define the lower and upper boundaries of the water layer (see Figure 2(b)) along the z direction while zi is the z coordinate of the ith water molecule. Nl(t0) = ∑N i=1 Θi(t0) is the number of molecules in the layer at a time origin t0, and 〈· · ·〉t0 represents an average over several time origins in the equilibrated portion of the trajectory. CT (t) as defined in (3), gives the probability that a water molecule stays in a given layer for a time length t, and its decay rate gives the mean residence time of water molecules in the layer. The rotational relaxation of water molecules within each water layer is captured through the second order orientation time correlation given by:\nCR(t) = (4)〈 1\nNl(t) N∑ i=1\n{ P2 [ûi(t0) · ûi(t0 + t)]\nt0+t∏ t′=t0 Θi(t ′) }〉 t0 ,\nwhere P2 is the second Legendre polynomial and ûi(t) is the unit vector parallel to the dipole moment vector of the ith water molecule. In (4), Nl(t) = ∑N i=1 ∏t0+t t′=t0 Θi(t ′),\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep ed\nM\na\nDynamics of Water Trapped in Transition metal oxide-Graphene Nano-confinement7\nis the number of water molecules that remains within the water layer throughout the time interval t0 to t0 + t. The decay time of CR(t) gives the reorientation time of the water molecules for a given layer.\nFigure 3(a) shows plots of survival probability CT (t) for water layers LS, LM and LG. For LS, CT (t) shows slow decay with stretched exponential dependence of the form CT (t) ∼ A0 exp([−t/τ0]β), where τ0 is an effective time constant and β = 0.27. The mean residence time given by τTS = ∫∞ 0 dt exp([−t/τ0]β), is of the order of ten nanoseconds. Similar behaviour has been observed for interfacial water layers in TiO2 nanopores [36, 37, 38]. CT (t) for LM and LG shows exponential decay C(t) ∼ A exp(−t/τ) (cf. inset Figure 3(a)). The average residence times for LM and LG are τ T M ≈ 10ps and τTG ≈ 7ps, respectively, three orders of magnitude faster than LS. The reorientation time correlation CR(t), (Figure 3(b)) exhibits an initial fast sub-picosecond decay, followed by much slower decay with a decay time of order of several picoseconds [39, 40] for all layers. This fast decay time corresponds to librations of the water dipole moment vector about a fixed direction. Beyond the libration time, the behaviour of CR(t) in all the water layers is best fitted to a stretched exponential dependence of the form CR(t) ∼ A0 exp([−t/τ0]β), with β = 0.14, 0.61, 0.59 for LS, LM and LG respectively. The observed long time orientation relaxation times are τ R S ≈ 45 ps for LS, τ R M ≈ 7.3 ps for LM and τ R G ≈ 6.1 ps for LG. Such non-exponential decay has been ascribed to the presence of a broad distribution of orientation times [41, 42]. Thus the rotational and translational relaxation times of LG and LM are quite comparable and both are significantly smaller than those of LS. This difference in time scales suggests that water molecules in LM layer cannot penetrate the LS layer. The water pinned to STO surface screens its hydrophilic effects from the rest of the water layers.\nAs the slit is made smaller it is observed that the residence time of water molecules in LG decreases sharply (Figure 3(c) closed symbols). An opposite behavior is observed for water in a symmetric graphene-graphene confinement, where the residence time close to the graphene layer is seen to increase with decreasing confinement (Figure 3(c) open symbols). The reduction in water residence time in LG as the slit width reduces for the asymmetric slit, is indicative of the increased tendency of water to dewet the hydrophobic surface due to interaction with the hydrophilic one in proximity. This dynamically signals enhanced hydrophobicity of the graphene surface in the vicinity of the hydrophilic STO surface, in agreement to the structural data. The reorientation time of water molecules in LG is less affected as the width varies, shown in Figure 3(d).\nThe relaxation dynamics may also be visualized via the self part of the translational and rotational van Hove density auto-correlation function (self-vHf) [43]. The self-vHf gives the probability of finding a particle at a distance |ξ| after a time ∆t, given that the particle is at the origin at time t = 0. For a two dimensional water layer, the self-vHf can be written as [44]:\nGξ(ξ, za, zb,∆t) =\n〈( 1\nNl(∆t) ) ×\nN∑ i=1\n{ δ(ξ − |~ξi(t0 + ∆t)− ~ξi(t0)|)\nt0+∆t∏ t′=t0 Θi(t ′) }〉 t0\n(5)\nwhere Gξ = (GT , GR) for translation and rotation respectively. za and zb define the\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep te\nM a\nus cr\nip t\nDynamics of Water Trapped in Transition metal oxide-Graphene Nano-confinement8\nboundaries of the water layer (see Figure 2(b)). For the translational self-vHf, ~ξi = ~r i ‖ is the projection of the particle positions on a plane parallel to the water layer. GT is measurable via neutron scattering experiments [43]. In (5), Nl(∆t) and Θi(t\n′) have the same meaning as defined in (3) and (4). For rotational degrees of freedom, the\nrotational trajectory is defined as [45]; ~ξi = ~φi(t) ≡ ∫ t0+t t0 δ~φi(t ′)dt′, where δ~φi(t) represents the displacement of the particle in the rotation space over a time interval δt, and has magnitude cos−1[ûi(t) · ûi(t+δt)] and direction ûi(t)× ûi(t+δt), with ûi(t) being the unit vector parallel to the ith water molecule dipole moment vector. The coarse graining time δt is chosen to be greater than the libration time of the water molecules.\nWe report Gξ at two representative times ∆t = τ ξ l /2 (intermediate) and ∆t = τ ξ l (long time), where τ ξl is the residence time or the rotational relaxation time for the lth water layer. Gξ is expected to be Gaussian for a normal liquid. The data for Gξ (ξ = R, T ) for different layers exhibit deviations from this normal behaviour as shown in Figure 4(a-b) for LS, 4(c-d) for LM and 4(e-f) for LG. In the translation space for LS, GT shows a double Gaussian behaviour, with a secondary peak at r/σ ≈ 1 (Figure 4(a)), where σ is the Lennard-Jones radius of the oxygen atom of the TIP4P water model. This indicates the existence of strongly pinned water molecules within the layer, which mainly vibrate about fixed positions and perform nearest neighbour jumps over long times. Similar conclusions have been reached for dynamics of glass forming liquids [46]. The rotational self-vHf for LS shows an initial Gaussian decay\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\npt ed\nM\nDynamics of Water Trapped in Transition metal oxide-Graphene Nano-confinement9\nfollowed by a tail part which is best fitted to exponential (Figure 4(b)). For LM, both GT and GR exhibit an initial Gaussian decay, followed by an exponential tail, as shown in Figure 4(c) and 4(d) respectively. A similar behaviour of GT and GR is observed for LG, as seen in Figure 4(e) and 4(f).\nTo quantify the behaviour of Gs(r, za, zb,∆t), for a given observation time ∆t, we fit lnGs(r, za, zb,∆t) ∼ −r2 for r < rc and lnGs(r, za, zb,∆t) ∼ −r + C0 for r > rc. The value of rc represents the displacement beyond which the self-vHf shows an exponential tail for a given ∆t. rc is expected to increase as ∆t increases, with the system approaching the diffusive regime. As shown in Figure 4(g) rc saturates as ∆t increases for both LM and LG. Similarly we fit lnGR(φ, za, zb,∆t) ∼ −φ\n2 for φ < φc and lnGR(φ, za, zb,∆t) ∼ −φ + c0 for φ > φc. φc represents the rotational displacement beyond which the rotational self-vHf is no longer Gaussian for a given ∆t. Figure 4(h) shows the dependence of φc on ∆t for LS, LM, and LG. As found for rc, the value of φc is observed to saturate as ∆t increases. These observations suggest that that the deviation from normal Gaussian behaviour persists till the residence time in both LM and LG.\nWe evaluate the in-plane translational and rotational mean squared displacement (MSD) of water molecules within each of the water layers, given by:〈\n∆ξ2(t) 〉\n= (6)〈 1\nNl(t) Nl∑ i=1\n{ |∆~ξi(t)|2\nt0+∆t∏ t′=t0 Θi(t ′) }〉 t0 .\nFor translational motion |∆~ξi(t)|2 = |∆~ri||(t)| 2 = |xi(t0 + t) − xi(t0)|2 + |yi(t0 + t) − yi(t0)|2, with xi and yi being the coordinates of the ith water molecule, and for rotational motion, |∆~ξi(t)|2 = |∆~φi(t)|2. The diffusion coefficient is given by Dξ = limt→∞ 〈 ∆ξ2(t) 〉 /4t. As before only water molecules that remain within the layer throughout the time interval t0 to t0 +t are considered. As shown in Figure 5(a), the translational mean square displacements for water molecules in each of the layers shows a linear dependence on time, with the diffusion coefficient in LS = 1.48× 10 −5 nm2/ps, two orders of magnitude less than the diffusion coefficients for LM and LG (1.31 × 10−3 nm2/ps and 2.41 × 10−3 nm2/ps respectively). The rotational MSD is less affected by the asymmetric confinement, and depends linearly on time (Figure 5(b)), with the rotational diffusion coefficient of the same order of magnitude for all the water layers (0.022 rad2/ps, 0.027rad2/ps and 0.046rad2/ps for LS, LM and LG respectively).\nDynamic heterogeneity – The self-vHf shows non-Gaussian behaviour, contrary to that expected for Fickian diffusion. Such non-Gaussian Brownian diffusion is considered an indication of dynamic heterogeneity [47], as discussed for super-cooled liquids and colloids [48, 49], and for intercalated water droplets close to critical temperature [5]. In order to have insights the dynamic heterogeneity, we probe each layer individually. Since the slowest relaxation is observed in translational motion, we focus on the translational degrees of freedom.\nFirst we probe the in-plane density distribution. For this, each layer is partitioned into a grid of square cells each of sides 1.5 Å, and the average density of water within each cell is evaluated for different time widows, T1 from 0 to 0.01 ns, and T2 from 5 to 5.01 ns after equilibration. T1 and T2 are taken sufficiently far apart from each\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan u\ncr ip\nt\nDynamics of Water Trapped in Transition metal oxide-Graphene Nano-confinement10\nother at temporal separation comparable to the slowest time scale in the system. The averaging time (10 ps) for the in-plane density is chosen to be of the order of the mean residence time of water molecules in the fast relaxing LM and LG layers. A similar choice of timescales has been has been used to study water dynamic heterogeneity at the surfaces of proteins [50], oxides [51] and metal electrodes [52]. Figure 6 shows plots of in-plane density profiles of each layer for the two different time windows considered. For both time windows, the in-plane density profiles are observed to be qualitatively similar.

Water molecules in LM tend to follow the disordered regions in LS, (see encircled regions in the Figure 6b). Theres is only a weak structural in-homogeneity in LG . Further insights to dynamic heterogeneity may be obtained from the distribution of local residence times of the water molecules. As before, we partition each water layer into a 2 dimensional grid, with each grid cell having a width of 5 Å.The grid size is larger than than that used in calculating the in-plane density profile and is so chosen as to have a number of water molecules for reasonable statistics. The local residence time correlation function for water within a grid cell υi in a given layer can be expressed as:\nCυiT (t) =\n〈 1\nNl(t0) N∑ i=1 ( t0+t∏ t′=t0 Θi(t ′)ζ(υi, t ′) )〉 t0 , (7)\nwhere ζ(υi, t ′) = 1 if the ith water molecule is located inside the grid cell, and zero otherwise, Θi(t ′) = 1 if za ≤ zi(t′) < zb and 0, otherwise. For each initial time t0, CυiT (t) is computed till it decays to zero.For LS this typically ∼ 10 ns and ∼ 20 ps for LM and LG. The quantity is averaged over 5000 initial times separated by 1 ps after equilibration.The time windows are adequate and not too small as to get unnecessary fluctuations due to poor averaging nor too large as to smooth out the data. The local residence time is defined from the time constant of an exponential fit to CυiT (t) data. The local residence times τl(x, y, z) is related to the effective free energy as: τl(x, y, z) ∝ 1υ exp (−βF (x, y, z)), where β = 1/kBT with kB the Boltzmann constant, and F (x, y, z) the effective free energy. τd is the time scale associated with particle translational diffusion, given by τd = 1/υ = d\n2/D, where D is the diffusion coefficient obtained from the MSD data for different layers, and d is the mean particle separation. We can thus express the free energy as: F (x, y, z) ∝ − 1β ln ( τl τd ) . Similarly, in the\nrotational space the free energy may be expressed as F (cosθ) ∝ − 1β ln ( τP (cosθ)\nτR\n) ,\nwhere τP (cosθ) is the persistence time for a given orientation cosθ, while τR is the mean rotational diffusion time estimated from the MSD data.\nFigure 7(a) shows the effective free energy landscapes in translational space for LS, LM and LG. The free energy landscape of LS is characterized by peaks and deep wells, imposed by the strong pinning of water molecules at hydrophilic STO surface (leftmost panel Figure 7(a)). The free energy profile in LM, has partial imprints\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nan us\ncr\nip\nt\nDynamics of Water Trapped in Transition metal oxide-Graphene Nano-confinement12\nFigure 6.

Many of the peaks in the free energy profile in LM (dotted circle) correspond to the wells of the profile in LS (solid circle), and vice-versa. The partial imprint confirms the screening of the hydrophilic surface by slow water layer in LS over STO. The regions where the slow and pinned water molecules in LS reside, is avoided by the water molecules in LM. This is consistent with the lateral density distribution of water molecules in each layer, shown in Figure 6(c). The effective free energy landscape is more homogeneous in LG (rightmost panel Figure 7(a)).\nThe heterogeneous dynamics is further evidenced by the distribution of local minima in the free energy landscape, Fmin, of LS, LM and LG (cf. Figure 7(b)). This distribution reflects the roughness of the energy landscape. The distribution is broad for LS, in agreement with the stretched exponential decay of CT (t). The broadening may be understood from the mobile defects observed in Figure 6(a). The double peak in the translational self-vHf (Figure 4(a)) can be assigned to two different relaxations at two distinct sites. Pining leads to overall slow relaxation in the layer. In comparison, the distributions are found to be relatively sharper for LM and LG. The distributions\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\np\nM\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nDynamics of Water Trapped in Transition metal oxide-Graphene Nano-confinement13\n.\nin LM is broader than in LG. The broadening can be taken as induced by that experienced in LS and also cause for dynamic heterogeneity. The distribution in LG is broader compared to the case of water molecules in symmetric graphene-graphene nano-slit. Physically, within the asymmetric nano-slit, water molecules experience a very different potential as they migrate from one layer to another and this introduces dynamic heterogeneity in the system.\nFigure 7(c) shows the free energy profiles in the orientation space for the different water layers, estimated from the persistence time data. For LS, four minima are observed, indicating four different adsorption modes of water molecules to the STO surface; θ = 0o: water dipole moment pointing perpendicular to the STO surface, and dipole moment vector oriented at : θ = 70o, θ = 1100 and θ = 1500, to the surface normal. The most prominent orientation, θ = 0o defines the mode in which water molecules form two hydrogen bonds with surface oxygen atoms. The proximity to LS, results in LM having a preferred orientation of θ = 60\no to the surface normal. For LG, the free energy profile is flat, with no preferred orientations of the molecules.\nComparison with other cases – Finally it is worth contrasting the dynamical behaviour of water trapped within asymmetric nano confinement to the other cases, to highlight the uniqueness of the asymmetric confinement.

Moreover, we consider the self-vHfs. We compare our data for the asymmetric confinement case with those of water within symmetric (graphene-graphene) nano confinements as well as close to single STO and single graphene surface. This comparison is summarized in Table 4. In bulk water as well as for water contact layer on a single graphene surface, the residence times of water molecules are comparable and the self-vHf both in translation and rotation are normal Gaussian. However, water molecules in the adsorbed layer on a single STO surface show different behaviour. Here, the residence time increases by two orders of magnitude compared to bulk water, the self-vHf in translation is double Gaussian and that in rotation shows an exponential tail. In 1 nm wide symmetric confinement of two graphene surfaces, the residence time increases by an order of magnitude compared to the single graphene or bulk case, and the self-vHfs for both translation and rotation are Gaussian. In the 1 nm wide asymmetric confinement the layer adjacent to STO (LS) is dynamically similar to the single STO case in terms of residence time and self-vHfs. However, LM and LG layers have an order of magnitude smaller residence times compared to the symmetric case.The time scale for these layers are similar to the bulk water and that in the vicinity of a single graphene layer. The faster time scales are due to attraction by the hydrophilic STO layer. The self-vHfs in LG and LG are quite different compared to the layer adjacent to single graphene or bulk, despite having similar residence times. The self-vHfs have linear tails for LG and LM.\nTable 4.

We investigate the behaviour of a bio-molecule, namely oleic acid, within the slit. We consider a 3% w/w oleic acid water mixture [53], within 2 nm wide STO-graphene, and 2 nm wide STO-STO nano slits. The oleic acid is modeled via\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep ed\nM\nan\nus cr\nip t\nDynamics of Water Trapped in Transition metal oxide-Graphene Nano-confinement15\nall-atom force field parameters taken from the GROMOS 54A7 [54] force field, and its interaction parameters with STO and graphene are calculated via the LorentzBerthelot mixing rules. The simulations are carried out at a constant volume, and the temperature is kept fixed using the Nose-Hoover thermostat. Each simulation consists of a 20 ns equilibration, followed by a 20 ns production run during which system snapshots are saved at intervals of 2 ps.\n.\nFigure 8 (a) and (b) show the equilibrium transverse density profiles of water, and the oleic acid (COO−) head group within the STO-graphene and the STO-STO nano slits respectively. It is evident from these plots that the density of the head group is strongly modulated by the water density, with the oleic acid tending to reside where the water density is least. Within the STO-graphene nano-slit, this causes the oleic acid to preferentially reside closer to the the hydrophobic surface (Figure 8 (a)), and to avoid the hydrophilic surface on which pining may occur. For the STO-STO slit the head group of the oleic acid molecules tend to reside close to each of the confining surfaces as shown in Figure 8 (b). The effect of different confinement is dramatic in the the mean squared displacement as shown in Figure 8 (c). There is a sharp increase in mobility of oleic acid within the STO-graphene slit, compared to the STOSTO slit. The self diffusion coefficient of the oleic acid within the STO-graphene slit is 1.05×10−4 nm2/ps an order of magnitude higher than in STO-STO nano-slit.Diffusion through nano-channels has been identified as the major rate limiting step during drug release [20].\nTiO2 is known to be a bio-compatible material [55] and has been suggested for\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\npt d\nM\nip t\nDynamics of Water Trapped in Transition metal oxide-Graphene Nano-confinement16\nuse in drug delivery. Typical drug molecules have a polar moiety which interacts with strongly hydrophilic polar TiO2 surface. This hinders the mobility of drug molecules through TiO2 nanopores and thereby, limiting its use for drug delivery.Although graphene is not bio-compatible, there are bio-compatible hydrophobic materials like cellulose, which lack the mechanical strength needed for long term implants [56]. It may be possible to impart mechanical support by overlaying such material over TiO2 surface suitable for implantable drug delivery devices [57]. For this, however, one needs to check if the fluid properties remain similar in the any asymmetric confinement. To investigate this, we carry out Grand Canonical Monte-Carlo (GCMC) simulations, followed by MD simulations, of a simplified model system consisting of a Lennard Jones liquid confined by two structureless walls, using the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) [58] .\nThe interaction between the LJ particles are modelled by the 12-6 LJ potential:\nU12−6(rij) = 4 pp [( σ r )12 − ( σrij )6] where rij is the distance between particle i and j, pp is the potential well depth and σ is the distance of zero potential. The Lennard Jones parameters are chosen to mimic TIP4P-ew water model, with pp = 0.16 k cal/mol, σ = 3.16 Å and particle mass m = 18.01 g/mol. Interactions between particles and the walls are modelled by the 9-3 LJ potential [59], U9−3(zij) =\n4 wp [ 2 15 ( σ r )9 − ( σrij )3] where zij is the distance of the particle from the wall, wp is the depth of the wall-particle potential. The ratio wp/ pp is set to 3.0, for one wall and 0.25 for the other wall. Clearly the walls are asymmetric in their interaction with the LJ particles. A cutoff value of 3.5σ is used for all interactions. Five random configurations are chosen from the equilibrated GCMC trajectories and investigated by MD to extract the MSD data.\nOur simulations yield a similar density profile (Fig. 8(d)) as in the all atom MD simulations of water in STO-graphene nano slit. The mean square displacement as a function of time for each of the liquid layers is shown in the inset of Figure 8(d). It is observed that the fluid layer adjacent to the strongly attracting wall (L1) remains relatively immobile while mobility in L2 in L2 and L3 are comparable and much higher than that of L1. The similarity between the two results suggests the behaviour of the water under the asymmetric confinement to be general. Hence, over-layer of biocompatible hydrophobic material on TiO2 may provide adequate support, and high mobility of drug molecules necessary for implantable drug delivery devices."

The resultant asymmetric, strong confinement produces square ice-like crystallites of water pinned at TiO2 surface and drives enhanced hydrophobicity of graphene via the proximity effect to the hydrophilic TiO2 surface. This importantly brings in dynamic heterogeneity, both in translational and rotational degrees of freedom, due to coupling between the slow relaxing, strongly adsorbed water layer at the hydrophilic oxide surface, and faster relaxation of subsequent water layers. The heterogeneity is signalled in ruggedness of the effective free energy landscapes. We discuss possible implications of our findings in drug delivery.",
