      "text" : "Heart failure (HF) is a multifaceted disorder with complex pathophysiology representing the end stage of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). It is known as a syndrome in which the heart dysfunction leads to a mismatch between blood supply and demand of the organs. HF represents a major leading cause of hospitalization and health care burden, and have a high prevalence and annually growing incidence with high morbidity and mortality worldwide.1,2 The American Heart Association/ American Colleges of Cardiology (ACC/AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) have recommended several biomarkers and guidelines for the diagnosis/prognosis and treatments of HF patients.3–6\nNevertheless, with the growing complexity and heterogeneity observed in HF progression, delineation of more reliable biomarkers with higher specificity and sensitivity for the early diagnosis and molecular monitoring of the disease state, and for having an accurate expectation of prognosis with sufficiently predictive precision is still urgent to optimize treatment options and decline mortality.7\nBesides high sensitivity and specificity, the ideal and implementable biomarker must meet several key criteria. It needs to be readily accessible; a biomarker must be ideally detected in easily reachable body fluids, such as plasma/serum, saliva, and urine. It must be changed in the relevant disease and can differentiate between patients and healthy subjects. The half-life of biomarkers should be relatively long in the body fluids, which warrants the predictability of detection. The expression levels and patterns of biomarkers must closely associate with the extent of pathologic\nconditions. The other important criteria are the robust reliability and reproducibility: the detection and quantification methods should be rapid, accurate, sensitive, and inexpensive, without particular need for equipment or instrument, which are essential for point-of-care and wide-spread popularization. The biomarkers must be consistent at different times and in various circumstances, and data from biomarker assays must be easily interpreted.8\nIn recent years, circulating exosomes and their contents have emerged as novel biomarkers because of the relatively easy and fast collection and measurement as well as diverse but tissue- or cell-specific biological and pathological functions. Of note, there has been an exponential growth in exosome-related research in the field of cardiovascular biology (Figure 1), and accumulating investigations have focused on the potential of exosomes as non-invasive clinical biomarkers.9 Exosomes are involved in intercellular communication between both proximal and distant cells under not only physiological conditions, such as cardiac growth, development, and angiogenesis, but also diverse pathological states, including atherosclerosis, cardiac remodeling, and heart failure (HF).10 Exosomes-mediated cellular cross-talk relies on their ability to deliver biological information from cell to cell. Notably, the cargo content of exosomes reflects disease state, thus serves as unique opportunities for biomarker discovery and development of non-invasive prognostics/diagnostics once assayed in biological fluids such as urine and serum/ plasma.11,12 microRNAs (miRs), one of the most important functional cargo of exosomes, are master regulators of the genome,13 which are often dysregulated in pathological conditions.14,15\nTheir selective packaging and intercellular delivery by\nexponentially risen. Graphical representation of publications\nindexed by PubMed over time,\ncontaining the search terms (a) “Exosome” and “Cardiovascular” and (b) “Exosome” and “microRNA” and “Cardiovascular”\nexosomes have excited deeper investigation of exosomal miRs (Exo-miRs), both as biomarkers and therapeutic agents.16–19 Changes of miRs content of circulating exosomes have been witnessed to be specifically associated with progression and state of pathological conditions, therefore making Exo-miRs promising biomarker candidates for diagnostic and prognostic monitoring of disease.16,17\nExo-miR is an emerging field and far less is generally known in comparison to exosomes (Figure 1). A growing body of preclinical and clinical evidence shows the potential of circulating Exo-miRs as the functional biomarker in CVDs,16,17 and the present review highlights those reported for diagnosis, prognosis, and outcome prediction in patients with HF. To this end, we will explain the feasibility of exosomes as clinical biomarkers, discuss the priority of circulating Exo-miRs over non-exosomal ones as a clinical biomarker, and then outline reported Exo-miRs having the biomarker potential in HF patients, together with their mechanisms of action."

      "heading" : "1.1 | Exosome biogenesis and function",
      "text" : "Exosomes are lipid bilayer extracellular vesicles with diameters starting from 30 nm and ranging up to 100 nm20 or 120 nm,21 generated by nearly all cell-types through the exocytosis of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane. Exosome biogenesis starts once a part of the plasma membrane buds into the cell to form an early endosome that transforms into late endosomes called MVBs filled with many intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). During this process, surface and transmembrane proteins located on the plasma membrane are incorporated into the invaginating membrane, while the cytosolic components are engulfed and enclosed within the ILVs. Upon fusion with the plasma membrane, MVBs release the ILVs into the extracellular space, referred to as the exosome.22,23 The exosome release is mainly controlled under regulation of intercellular trafficking of MVBs to the plasma membrane by endocytosis-associated proteins; the Rab small GTPase family members like Rab11, Rab35, and Rab27a/b and lipid raft complexes.24–26 Moreover, the docking and fusion of MVBs to the plasma membrane is facilitated by SNARE (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-fusion-protein-attachment-protein-receptor) and VAMP (v-SNAREs like VAMP7 and VAMP2) proteins, allowing for the release of exosomes outside of the cell.27 The exosome release may be constitutive or promoted by stimuli, such as elevated intracellular calcium, thermal and oxidative stresses, DNA damage,\nthrombin, hypoxia, extracellular ATP, cytokines, and LPS,28–31 under an adjustive mechanism by which cells regulates their internal stress states and the extracellular environment.32\nThe exosome release is an important secreted fashion of contact between cells. Exosomes carry specific surface markers, such as CD63 and CD81, and transport a wide range of biologically active cargo consisting of cellspecific proteins, lipids, and genetic materials, to the target cells. Possible outcomes following the exosome release include: (a) their capture by neighboring cells or reabsorption by their secretory cells; (b) their remote relocation, recognition by a cell, and fusion with its cell membrane; and (c) their entrance into the circulating fluid and movement to other organs. Indeed, exosomes act locally via autocrine and paracrine signaling or enter the blood circulation and travel to distant cells, acting on recipient cells through receptor ligand-binding in which transmembrane proteins of exosomes interact directly with the signaling receptors of target cells33; fusion with the plasma membrane of recipient cells and deliver their contents into their cytosol; and internalization into the recipient cells via clathrin- or caveolin-dependent endocytosis34,35 as well as macropinocytosis- or phagocytosismediated uptake.36,37 Thereby, exosomes participate in cell-to-cell communication by a complex intercellular exchange of genetic information and/or regulation of certain gene expressions, changing function and behavior of recipient cells.38\nNoteworthy, exosomes released into bodily fluids are the major mediators of intercellular communications.38\nOf note, the success of biological functions of exosomes is highly mediated by the effective transfer of genetic materials such as DNA, miRs, long noncoding RNAs, mRNAs, and ribosomal RNA.39,40 Of these, miRs are known to be the most abundant in human plasma-derived exosomal RNA species, accounting for over 50% of all exosomal RNA.41"

      "text" : "The miRs are regulatory noncoding-RNAs (18–25 nucleotides) originating from either intronic or exonic regions of the genome in the eukaryote cells. In the nucleus, a miR gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase II into long primary miR (pri-miR) that is cleaved by type III endonuclease DROSHA to produce 70–80 nucleotides precursor miR (pre-miR) with stem-loop structure. Pre-miRs are then transported to the cytoplasm, mediated by the nuclear export system the RanGTPase/Exportin5. In the cytoplasm, pre-miRs are further cleaved by another\nRNase III enzyme (Dicer) into two separate miRs structured as the RNA duplex ( 22 nucleotides), commonly termed the mature and passenger (or *strand) miR. While the passenger miR is often degraded, mature duplex miRs incorporate into the miR-induced silencing complex (miRISC) and guide RISC to target mRNA. One mature single-stranded miR remains in the complex, and under the action of RISC and Argonaute proteins, miR binds to complementary sequences in the 3 0 untranslated region\nof mRNA and suppress the expression through either inhibiting translation initiation or inducing mRNA degradation.42\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are, at least, four potential mechanisms for sorting cytosolic miRs into exosomes, however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. The first potential mechanism is by ceramide/neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2)dependent pathway, in which nSMase2 hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to sphingolipid ceramide that facilitates the process from endosomal vesicle formation to the transportation of miRs into exosomes.43–46 The second one is by EXOmotifs/SUMOylated hnRNP-dependent pathway. In this way, the short and specific sequence motifs (EXOmotifs) in miRs have been suggested to guide the transport of miRs to exosomes. Indeed, EXOmotifs can assist heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1) to detect and bind to specific miRs, while sumoylation regulates the rate of this binding.46,47 The third potential mechanism is by the 30- terminal miR sequence-dependent pathway.46,48 It has been found that 30-terminal adenylated miRs dominate the parental cells, whereas 30-terminal uridylated ones dominate the exosomes, suggesting the 30-terminal miR sequence as a possible player in packaging miRs into exosomes.48 The last potential mechanism is via the miRISC-related pathway.46,49–51 Mature miR can interact with assembly proteins to form a complex called miRISC. The miRISC consists of miR, miR-targeted mRNA, GW182, and AGO2 (miR effector protein). Any alteration in one of the miRISC components has been found to influence the sorting of miRs into exosomes. For instance, a middle domain in AGO2 protein mediates interaction with adenine (A) and uracil (U) at the phosphorylated 50-terminal of miRs that are enriched in exosomes compared to miRs without U or A at their 50-terminal.51 Another finding supporting the role of miRISC in miR packaging is that GW182, the main component of miRISC, can be localized in exosomes.49\nEventually, once miRs are packed into exosomes, they can undergo unidirectional transfer between cells, resulting in the establishment of an intercellular trafficking network, which, in turn, elicits transient or persistent phenotypic changes of recipient cells."

      "text" : "The release of exosomes into the body fluid circulation represents a solid foundation for their extraction and analysis. Exosomes can be isolated from cell culture supernatant or bodily fluids by several techniques with varying weaknesses and strengths, including differential ultracentrifugation,52 gel (size) exclusion chromatography,53–55 the polymer precipitation method, immune affinity capture method,56,57 the microfluidic chip method,58 and Optiprep™ density gradient method.59 Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages and may be dictated by the sample source and the intended use of exosomes. Among these, ultracentrifugation is the most commonly used gold standard method to purify exosomes. Although the method is simple and suitable for large-volume samples, it has some drawbacks including the unstable recovery rate, labor-intensive, time-consuming, and requiring high-cost laboratory equipment, making it limit for clinical use. Moreover, the disadvantages of repeated centrifugation, which may damage the vesicle membrane, limit its application.60 Nowadays, commercially available kits have been emerged to enrich exosomes, including ExoQuick (System Bioscience),61 the Total Exosome Isolation kit (Invitrogen),62 Exospin (Cell Guidance System).63 They are primarily size based precipitation methods with greatly shortening operation time less than 2 hr, and have been proven to be efficient, reliable, and reproducible when compared with other methods. With ExoQuick method, exosomes can be isolated in a one-step precipitation protocol, which has been found to be as efficient as ultracentrifugation in isolating serum exosomes for Exo-miR profiling.64\nThere are several criteria used for exosome characterization, including size, morphology, flotation density, and the presence of exosomal marker proteins, such as ALIX, TSG101, flotillin 1, HSP70, CD9, CD63, and CD81.65 The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles has published recommendations for the characterization of exosome.65 Typically, the presence of exosomes in a particular source can be confirmed by either: (a) the detection of at least three exosome markers such as CD63, CD9, and CD81 or (b) observation of a cup-shaped morphology under negative-staining electron microscopy.65\nSince exosomes are generated in the endosomal pathway, antibodies targeting markers associated with this pathway are useful to identify exosomes. These include the tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, and CD81), TSG101, CD326/ EPCAM, and AIP1/ALIX.65 Additionally, the characterization of single vesicles by size is used to demonstrate the degree of homogeneity in the sample. In addition, electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis are\nrecommended to be employed for analyzing the uniformity of size distribution.66,67\nDespite the aforementioned available approaches, the ideal characterization of exosomes is still a field in flux and regular updates to the recommendations are expected.68 During the last years, an interesting approach using surface plasmon resonance in combination with antibody microarrays specific to exosome membrane proteins of extracellular domains has been developed to quantitatively detect and characterize cell-specific exosomes without purification or enrichment. Notably, it can represent an easy, efficient, and novel method for the detection and monitoring of exosomes, thus creating an avenue to advance biomarker applications of exosomes.69\nFurther, to improve standard techniques, the EV-TRACK knowledgebase has been recently developed,70 which enables the researchers to deposit methodological parameters (e.g., source of exosomes, protein markers, and centrifugal force) into a central repository, in favor of an exosome metric, which quantifies the strength of their method."

      "heading" : "1.4 | Limitations and advantages of exosomes as clinical biomarkers",
      "text" : "To facilitate the clinical use of exosomes, efficient and cost–benefit isolation and characterization methods are essential. Of note, the lack of techniques to rapidly isolate, purify, quantitate, and identify exosomes are the main drawbacks limiting the clinical application of exosomes. Recent established technical advances not only may be able to mitigate these drawbacks and facilitate exosome research but also can make exosomal prognostic/diagnostic more cost-efficient.53,59,68,71–74 However, additional challenges are the consistency and reproducibility of the product lots as well as inadequate standardization and quality control across study groups. Therefore, much more investigations are required for vigorous validation of these approaches to be successfully implemented in clinical diagnosis/prognosis.\nNonetheless, exosomes are widely considered to have strong potential to contain valuable biomarkers for experimental and clinical applications. The components and biogenesis of exosomes are strongly directed procedures that are affected by various activating stimuli and stress signals that reflect changes in the environmental conditions. By delivering biologically active cellular constituents from the donor to the recipient cells, exosomes play unique functions in proximal and distant intercellular communication under both normal and pathological conditions in the body, suggesting that exosomes and their biologically active cargos can provide prognostic/\ndiagnostic information in various pathophysiological conditions, such as CVDs.75–77 Using exosomes as the source for biomarker development might have several advantages when compared to other existing strategies.\nExosomal content is selectively packaged with proteins and genetic materials that can mirror the cellular origin and its physiological/pathological states, as a “signature” or “fingerprint” of the donor cell, and also can change the function and behavior of recipient cells.76,78–83 In terms of type and concentration, exosomes are also specific,84–86 which shows they can reflect an individual's health status.87 This specificity enables the analysis of low-abundance molecules of interest in a less complex environment.78,88\nMoreover, exosomes are readily available in various bodily fluids, including saliva,89–91 nasal secretions,92 urine,93,94 breast milk,89,95 serum/plasma,89,96 ascites, seminal fluid,97 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, amniotic fluid,93 synovial fluid,98 and cerebrospinal fluid.33,99 Of note, Easy accessibility of exosomes through the collection of minimally invasive (such as blood) or noninvasive (such as urine and saliva) samples enables the prevention of repetitive invasive procedures, such as excision tissue biopsy, as well as the avoidance of sampling limitations100 and possible difficulties in obtaining real samples101; providing the decreased patient pain and inconvenience as well as the lower cost and higher speed of analysis. This can points toward their being as an ideal source for clinical biomarkers.90,102,103 Notably, compared with biomarkers detected in conventional specimens such as serum or urine, exosomal biomarkers provide comparable or higher specificity and sensitivity ascribed to their excellent stability. Particularly, exosomal-based biomarkers like Exo-miRs from easily accessible biofluids are the best source compared to non-exosomal, cell-free, or whole unfractionated miR samples and would be very suitable for clinical applications.104,105"

      "text" : "Nowadays, circulating miRs hold great promise as a new class of diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for predicting cardiovascular diseases such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and HF. This is largely based on their capacity to discriminate normal and diseased cells.106 At the same time, their higher stability compared to proteins and other nucleic acids, both in the circulation and in fixed tissues makes them especially wellsuited to sampling and analysis.107 Notably, the exosomal reservoir of circulating miRs has added advantages as\nbiomarkers over and above “free” circulating miRs,104 as discussed in the following paragraphs.\nThe biological function is a primary requirement for a candidate biomarker. Circulating miRs, which are detected in most body fluids such as saliva, breast milk, urine, and serum/plasma, can be released from diverse cell types as a result of passive or active secretion. The miRs can be accidentally and freely released secondary to the passive leakage from the damaged and apoptotic/ necrotic cells, and therefore lack biological function. By contrast, in active secretion, the release of miRs is directed via extracellular vesicles like exosomes or via a protein-miR complex like lipoproteins and Argonaute protein, in which circulating miRs can exert important biological activities.108,109 Of note, miRs in exosomes are selectively transferred into cells in distant organs and actively modulate signaling in recipient cells.110,111 Moreover, circulating exosomes from many cell types may contain similar surface proteins to the cell from which they are derived, enabling recognition of their source, while it is a major challenge to determine the cell origin of a specific free miR in the circulation under (patho) physiological conditions.112,113\nNotably, circulating Exo-miRs have higher sensitivity and specificity, the two important indices for biomarkers. It has been shown that the majority of miRs detectable in the serum and saliva is concentrated in circulating exosomes, allowing for more sensitive tests than those in the serum.90 Besides, circulating Exo-miRs are representative of miRs profile of the parental cells and can differentiate patients from healthy subjects. Notably, alterations in circulating levels of Exo-miRs are correlated with the disease progression as well as with certain biological or pathological stages in patients with CVD, whereas circulating free miRs have failed to show a correlation.114 Blood levels of free miRs can be affected by several factors that negatively influence their specificity and sensitivity. In addition to ethnicity, lifestyle, sex, and inflammatory conditions115–118; free miRs may also show remarkable variations between sample types including plasma, serum, and whole blood.119 Interestingly, ExomiRs effectively circumvent such limitations because of their stable expression. The stable expression of Exo-miRs and their resistance to the influence of external factors that might affect their expression,120 along with the development and application of high-throughput sequencing technology for measuring the expression profiles of miRs,121 greatly enhance the specificity and sensitivity of Exo-miRs-based biomarkers.\nIn case of stability that is an important determinant factor for a biomarker candidate, the lipid bilayer membrane of exosomes serves as a shield that prevents RNase degradation and thus Exo-miRs provide a stable source of\ncirculating miRs.122 Such stability exhibits that Exo-miRs are long-lived in biological fluids77,123 and can, therefore, provide attractive biomarkers with high sensitivity. In terms of storage, exosomes show a high in vitro integrity and resistant to storage handling. Importantly, Exo-miRs are stable for a long-term (5 years) at −20 C, unaffected for 2 weeks at 4 C, and resistant to multiple freeze–thaw cycles.124 Thus, exosomes, as a source of miRs, are efficient tools for the storage and recovery of miRs under conditions that normally degrade free miRs.125\nIn conclusion, because of the relatively easy and fast collection and measurement as well as the high specificity and sensitivity, circulating Exo-miRs have growingly received great attention for their non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic potentials in various heart diseases such as HF.106"

      "text" : "IN HF\nThe diagnosis/prognosis of heart failure is often difficult, and biomarkers together with other clinical studies can contribute to the diagnosis. Echocardiography is a useful component of diagnosis, but in the acute setting, it may not always be possible to obtain an echocardiogram, particularly out of hours. The cardiac natriuretic peptides (BNP and NTproBNP) are the most extensively studied biomarkers with cardinal significance in HF which are routinely used in clinical practice. As a result of myocardial stretch, the B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) gene is induced and prohormone proBNP is expressed. This is cleaved to the biologically active BNP and the biologically inert but stable N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP). However, it should be noted that there are many other causes of raised natriuretic peptides in addition to HF, including non-cardiac causes such as age, anemia, and renal failure which decrease the specificity of natriuretic peptides for diagnosis of HF.7 Additionally, in some clinical trials, it has been found that the measurement of BNP cannot conclusively affect hospital mortality rates or have no apparent effects on clinical outcomes, making its prognostic value debatable.126\nThus, the search for new biomarkers of HF remains a large and growing enterprise.\nIn recent years, circulating Exo-miRs have successfully gained huge interest for their diagnostic and prognostic potentials in heart diseases.10,106,127 Importantly, the transportation of cardiac-specific miRs in exosomes can be rapidly detected in plasma, holding great potential as specific diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for predicting the risk of the development of heart\ndiseases.10,128 Of note, exosomes can mediate communications among cardiac cells, including cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.129,130 This function is essential to support myocardium with oxygen and nutrients in normal heart, and in turn, maintain heart homeostasis structural integrity. Upon pathological stimuli, the secreted exosomes from cardiac cells will positively and negatively impact the function of neighbored cells.131 Although the investigation of circulating ExomiRs as the biomarker for heart diseases is still in its infancy, it has been evidenced that cardiac-specific circulating Exo-miRs are differentially regulated in the failing heart, suggesting their potential complementary role in the diagnosis and prognosis of HF. In the following sections, we discuss the current knowledge about circulating Exo-miRs as prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers in HF (Table 1)."

      "text" : "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the main cause of acute heart failure (AHF) that presents a serious pathophysiological state of DCM.140 Currently, DCMassociated AHF (DCM-AHF) is mainly diagnosed by echocardiographic data and clinical biochemical parameters, such as BNP. Echocardiographic data are employed to evaluate whether pathogenesis is mainly due to DCM, whereas the alteration of BNP levels can assist to determine whether a patient with DCM is in the dangerous state of AHF. However, the data from echocardiographic examination and biochemical assessment of BNP are neither specific nor cost–benefit for the diagnosis of DCMAHF.141\nmiR-92b-5p has been found to cause cardiac disease by reducing the expression of short stature homeobox 2 (Shox2) transcription factor that controls the development and function of the cardiac conduction.142,143 A clinical study showed that the serum level of Exo-miR92b-5p is significantly increased in DCM-AHF patients.139 Importantly, the Exo-miR-92b-5p level in the serum was found to distinguish DCM-AHF patients from healthy subjects with high sensitivity and moderate specificity, which can compensate for the low specificity of BNP.139 Data from echocardiographic indices demonstrate that the serum level of Exo-miR-92b-5p is conversely associated with the left ventricular fraction shortening (LVFS) and left ventricular ejection fraction\n(LVEF), implying a negative correlation of Exo-miR-92b5p expression with the function of the left ventricle. The Exo-miR-92b-5p level was also found to be directly correlated with the left atrial diameter (LAD), left ventricular diastolic diameters (LVDD), and systolic diameters (LVSD), indicating that its expression is positively associated with dilation of the left ventricle.139 Importantly, the differential level of serum Exo-miR-92b-5p was shown to be specific to HF patients, as analysis of patients with or without diabetes mellitus and renal failure indicated that neither diabetes mellitus nor renal failure affected the expression of serum Exo-miR-92b-5p.139\nSimilarly, another study was also shown that the serum level of Exo-miR-92b-5p is significantly increased in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients.138\nThe levels of the serum Exo-miR-92b-5p could discriminate HFrEF patients from healthy subjects with high sensitivity and specificity.138 Analysis of echocardiographic data revealed that the serum level of Exo-miR-92b-5p is negatively correlated with the function of the left ventricle, whereas it is positively correlated with dilation of the left ventricle.138 Moreover, the increased plasma level of Exo-miR-92b was also found to define a score with high sensitivity and specificity for the discrimination of patients with the HFrEF relative to the healthy controls. Of note, the Exo-miR-92b score was indicated to associate with increased serum levels of natriuretic peptides as well as dilatation of the left ventricle and left atrium.134 Taken together, these reports represent the serum level of ExomiR-92b-5p as a potential biomarker for DCM-AHF and HFrEF diagnosis."

      "text" : "Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PCM) is the life-threatening pregnancy-correlated cardiomyopathy in previously healthy women, leading to PCM-mediated acute AHF (PCM-HF) characterized by a sudden onset of HF in the last month of pregnancy and/or in the first months postpartum.144 HF is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation.145,146 An important director of such chronic inflammation is a feed-forward loop including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which induces inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, and these cytokines, in turn, activate NF-κB.146 miR-146a was found to be a cardiomyocyte-enriched miR that controls cell survival and plays as a central regulatory component of the inflammatory hub.132 Inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), were shown to increase the expression of miR-146a\nin cardiomyocytes.132 In response to inflammation, the miR-146a expression is increased, and then the induced miR-146a, in a negative feedback loop, targets the inflammatory mediators and alleviates inflammation.132,147\nmiR-146a is also known to increase cardiomyocytes' survival and protect them against oxidant stress thus mediate a cardiomyocyte-protective activity.148,149 miR-146a is secreted into circulation by damaged cardiomyocytes and can be detected in serum or circulating exosomes.132 Of note, the plasma level of miR-146a has been shown to be increased in patients with PCM-AHF, but not in patients with DCM suffering a similar degree of HF and pregnancy-matched healthy controls.135 miR-146a was also found to be higher in cardiac tissue from PCM patients compared with that from DCM patients.135\nTherefore, as PCM and DCM patients with similar degrees of HF display similar increases in NT-proBNP, miR-146a may serve as a specific biomarker for the diagnosis of PCM in patients.135 Another clinical study indicates that there is a significantly higher level of miR-146a in circulating and cardiac-derived exosomes than in plasma of HF patients when compared to healthy controls.132 Taken together, these primary findings can help to develop circulating Exo-miR-146a as a specific biomarker to distinguish PCM patients who have a good potential for recovery from PCM patients with preexisting\nheart disease (i.e., DCM or genetic forms of HF) who have a much lower recovery potential and are more likely to require heart transplantation or assist device support."

      "text" : "Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common cause of valvular heart disease called mitral valve prolapse (MVP), with a prevalence of 3% in the adult population. Histological abnormalities, referred to as myxomatous alterations, involve fragmentation and disruption of elastin fibers and the collagen within the valves.150 MMVD is a major risk factor for chronic HF (MMVD-CHF). Although most MVP events are benign, ruptured chordae or poor coaptation of the valve leaflets can cause mitral regurgitation, cardiac enlargement, and contractile dysfunction.\nMMVD in dogs closely resembles MVP in humans with respect to structural and functional consequences, making this canine disease an attractive preclinical model.151 It was reported that the plasma levels of ExomiR-181c and Exo-miR-495 are significantly increased in dogs with MMVD-CHF compared to MMVD and normal dogs, revealing a role in initiation, progression, or\nconsequence of CHF.152 miR-181c is known to regulate mitochondrial gene expression in cardiomyocytes. miR181c overexpression causes an elevated generation of mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase, which is correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction, elevated production of reactive oxygen species, elevated oxygen consumption in cardiomyocytes, as well as reduced LVEF.153,154 Moreover, miR-181c can promote mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death by targeting the Bcl-2 gene, an apoptosis regulator.155,156 miR-495 was also found to be upregulated with heart disease, particularly in advanced disease with HF.157,158 Overexpression of miR-495 has been demonstrated to induce DNA synthesis and proliferation in cardiomyocytes.157 The proliferation-promoting impact of miR-495 is consistent with cardiac hypertrophy detected in advanced heart diseases with cardiac remodeling.152 Given the remarkable elevation in MMVDCHF, Exo-miR-181c and Exo-miR-495 may provide a potential biomarker to help to monitor the progression to active CHF in patients at risk for developing CHF.152"

      "text" : "Pathological cardiac remodeling is responsible for the progression toward HF. It is an elevation in ventricular volume in response to cardiac injury following MI. This process is defined as the post-infarct ventricular remodeling, which leads to pathological alterations in the architecture and function of ventricular, with associated enlargement of the left ventricular chamber and a reduction in LVEF. Ventricular dysfunction provides a prediction value to HF and increased mortality.165,166 A critical aspect to be noted is that the incidence of ventricular dysfunction has a poor prognosis. Around 50% of patients with the diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction will die within 5 years. Moreover, 40% of patients die within 1 year after hospitalization for heart failure.167 A considerable part of deaths correlated with cardiac dysfunction results from sudden death,168 showing that it is not a guarantee of a good prognosis if a patient has no symptom.\nCardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, the most prevalent cardiac cells, play a critical role in the remodeling process after MI. Ventricular remodeling typically features cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis and myocardial fibrosis.71 Myocardial injury promotes cardiomyocyte death and destroys the vasculature, thereby leading to several effects to induce repair and maintain cardiac integrity, including cardiac fibrosis which affects the architecture and the structure of the heart resulting in cardiac remodeling. Collagen secreting myofibroblasts are known to mainly mediate fibrosis. These cells not only are a regulating and secreting cell type but also participate in maintaining the extracellular environment of cardiomyocytes. Notably, it has been shown that exosome-mediated crosstalk between cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts is involved to create fibrosis during cardiac remodeling in HF.130,169 Of note, some reports show that circulating Exo-miRs can associate with the left ventricular remodeling after MI, through the impact on cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis, thus presenting valuable prognostic biomarkers for cardiac remodeling in HF patients.\nCirculating Exo-miRs and cardiomyocyte injury Injured cardiomyocytes have been found to secrete exosomes enriched with cardiac-specific miRs, and there is evidence suggesting that Exo-miRs may represent functional mediators in heart disease.170,171 It has been shown that the expression of miR-34 family members is increased\nin the cardiac cells in response to AMI and systemic injection of anti-miR-34 significantly inhibits cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in a mouse model of AMI.163 Moreover, the expression of miR-34a and miR-194 can be directly induced by the tumor suppressor p53,172,173 which has been shown to result in the induction of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a mouse model of AMI.164 Of note, Matusmoto et al. reported that the plasma levels of p53-responsive miR-194 and miR34a in circulating exosomes of post-AMI patients with FH were significantly associated with LVEF and “left ventricular end-diastolic dimension” measured 1 year after AMI onset, as clinical parameters of cardiac remodeling. This finding suggests the potential of exosomal miR-194 and miR-34a as a prognostic biomarker for the prediction of left ventricular remodeling after the convalescent stage of AMI.136\nCirculating Exo-miRs and cardiac fibrosis A hallmark feature of ventricular remodeling is cardiac fibrosis characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix and fibrosis formation, occurring through the secretion of collagen I, collagen III, and fibronectin by myofibroblasts.174 Cardiac fibrosis is an independent and predictive risk factor of morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiac dysfunction and/or HF.133,175–177 A cohort study in HF patients indicated that levels of miR425 and miR-744 in the plasma exosomes are decreased during the development of HF and contribute to the pathogenesis of myocardial fibrosis.137 The experimental study revealed that the reduction of miR-425 and miR744 leads to overexpression of collagen 1 and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), which causes fibrogenesis of cardiac fibroblasts.137 In mechanism, miR-744 and miR-425 were found to suppress TGF-β178 and TGF-β receptor137 expression, respectively, via targeting 30 UTR. TGF-β is a major contributor to the cardiac fibrosis, and myocardial TGF-β synthesis is markedly and consistently upregulated in animal models of heart failure. TGF-β binding to the receptor results in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, and then promotes collagen formation and fibrogenesis, through inducing expression of collagen I and α-SMA in myofibroblasts.179 These findings indicate that plasma levels of Exo-miR-425 and Exo-miR744 may present a valuable prognostic biomarker to predict cardiac fibrosis and ventricular dysfunction in patients with HF137; however, further experimental and proof-of-concept studies are needed to confirm that."

      "heading" : "5 | CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE",
      "text" : "Currently, the search for new biomarkers of heart diseases remains a large and increasing enterprise. New\nsurrogate markers for heart diseases should be specific, sensitive, accurate, quickly detectable, and noninvasively collected from easily accessible body fluids. Exosomes are nanovesicles that can be isolated from nearly all body fluids. Those secreted by a damaged or diseased heart can exhibit alterations in the miRs' profile that may reflect the cellular origin and (patho) physiological state, as a “signature” or “fingerprint” of the donor cell. These characteristics exhibit that circulating Exo-miRs better reflect the cellular processes correlated with the pathogenesis of heart disease. With respect to HF, the transportation of cardiac-specific miRs in exosomes can be rapidly detected and measured, holding great potential for specific diagnosis/ prognosis and outcome prediction. Due to such feasibility of the implementation, circulating Exo-miRs have successfully gained huge interests for their diagnostic and prognostic potentials in HF.\nThe present review of preclinical and clinical studies can conclude that circulating Exo-miRs represent emerging biomarkers for HF. Of note, the serum level of ExomiR-92b-5p may discriminate DCM-AHF and HFrEF patients from healthy subjects with high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, elevated levels of serum Exo-miR146a may distinguish PCM patients who have a good potential for recovery from PCM patients with preexisting heart disease who have a much lower recovery potential and are more likely to require heart transplantation or assist device support. Further, circulating Exo-miR-181c and Exo-miR-495 may serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis of MMVD mediated CHF. Besides, in the sera of post-AMI patients who developed HF within 1 year of AMI onset, coordinately increased levels of three exosomal p53-responsive miRs (Exo-miR-192, Exo-miR-194, and Exo-miR-34a) may serve as predictors for future progression of HF. Of these, circulating Exo-miR-194 or ExomiR-34a, along with Exo-miR-425 or Exo-miR-744, may provide prognostic value for prediction of cardiac fibrosis and left ventricular dysfunction after the convalescent stage of AMI in HF patients.\nAccordingly, the Exo-miRs biomarkers could provide important diagnostic and prognostic values for better management of HF. However, Exo-miR research in the field of heart disease is still in its infancy and relatively few studies have been conducted on HF issues to date, but holds promise. Notably, more in-depth research is warranted for further understanding the changes of ExomiRs profile of cardiac cells in various regions of the myocardium upon HF and the role of cell type-specific Exo-miRs at the time of myocardium injury. Before they can be used in clinical practice, more prospective, largescale, multi-centered clinical trials are needed to confirm diagnostic and prognostic values of circulating Exo-miRs\nfor HF. Undoubtedly, the emergence of Exo-miR-based biomarkers in the context of HF will herald a new chapter in clinical diagnosis/prognosis setting.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST We wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.\nORCID Amir A.
