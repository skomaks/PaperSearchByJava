The XRD and XPS results are in good agreement and confirmed the formation of Co3O4eCuO nanocomposite by wet chemical method. To date, the performance of hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline for the composite catalyst is comparable or superior to cobalt oxide based HER electro-catalysts. The HER catalyst exhibits the lowest Tafel slope of 65 mVdec 1 for the cobalt-based catalysts in alkaline media. A current density of 10 mA/cm2 is achieved at a potential of 0.288 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The mixed transition metal oxide Co3O4eCuO based HER electro-catalyst is highly stable and durable. The EIS results demonstrates that HER is highly favorable on the Co3O4eCuO due to the relatively small charge transfer resistance (173.20 Ohm) and higher capacitance values (1.97 mF).\n© 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

      "text" : "Hydrogen being a neat and the potential renewable energy resource has been considered as a promising alternative to replace the fossil fuels [1e4]. The electrochemical water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen in an electrolyzer is the\ndu.pk (Z.H. Ibupoto).\nons LLC. Published by Els\nmost exciting technology to produce high purity molecular hydrogen [5e10]. Despite the advantageous features of water electrolysis for hydrogen production, still, it is limited by the poor performance of non-precious catalysts and high scarcity of the noble catalysts [2,11]. To date, platinum (Pt) is only up to the mark catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but its high cost and low abundance do not allow it for the\nevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\nwidespread applications [12,13]. To replace Pt, transition metal-based compounds including metal sulfides [13e18], selenides [19,20], phosphides [21e23], nitrides [24,25], carbides [26,27], oxides [28], and metal alloys [29,30] have been employed due to their low cost and earth abundant nature. Also, different recent works on the hydrogen production are reported recently [31e36], Moreover, the industrial catalysts such as nickel (Ni) and stainless steel are also frequently used as water reduction and oxidation in alkaline media [37]. It is proved that nickel is not a perfect HER catalyst because of its high overpotential approximately and large Tafel slope values [37,38]. Importantly, nickel is carcinogenic substance reported elsewhere. Also, a wide range of active and stable non-noble metal based HER catalysts in alkaline media are reported [39e46]. In order to achieve performance like Pt from nonprecious catalysts is still at an early stage since a single nonprecious catalyst is lacking either due to the absence of high activity or stability issues [47e50].\nSince few decades, transition metal oxides are found promising oxygen evolution reaction OER catalysts in alkaline solution [51]. Recently, transition metal oxides are combined with noble metals to enhance the HER activity in alkaline media. Heterostructured electrocatalyst can be designed at the nano- or micro levels [52e57]. However, pristine transition metal oxides are known as poor catalysts for HER due to their high unsuitable hydrogen adsorption energy. Moreover, perovskite oxide shows a remarkable effectiveness for HER electrocatalyst that is active and stable in alkaline media. The most recent achievements of perovskite oxide for the electrocatalysis enhanced the functionality and provide a possible future research direction for double perovskites [53]. But the metal oxides based on earth abundant materials are of great interest to materialize for large scale and practical applications, thus more investigations are needed to improve their functional properties. In the present research hypothesis, a small incorporation of the copper concentration into the Co3O4 nanowires precursor brought a significant enhancement in the catalytic activity due to the possible decreases in the hydrogen adsorption energy and an enhanced conductivity.\nHerein, we report for the first time a new class of composite namely Co3O4eCuO nanostructure exhibiting an excellent HER activity and good stability in alkaline media. The structural and composition characterization are carried out by various analytical techniques such as SEM, EDS, XRD, and XPS. The composite catalyst is mainly composed of Co3O4 and CuO and no other impurity is detected. This electro-catalyst achieved a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at a potential of 0.288 V vs RHE in alkaline media."

      "text" : "Cobalt chloride hexahydrate, copper chloride dihydrate, 20% Pt/C, 85% potassium hydroxide KOH, fluorine-doped tin oxide FTO and urea of 99.5% purity were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Stockholm, Sweden. In a typical synthesis, 2.37 g of cobalt chloride hexahydrate, 1.20 g of copper chloride dihydrate and 0.6 g of urea were dissolved in 100 mL of the deionized water. The solution was stirred for 20 min until a\nhomogeneous solution is obtained. Then FTO substrate was sonicated in acetone and washed several times with the deionized water. The cleaned FTO substrates were coated with a colloidal seed solution of cobalt chloride by a dip coating method. The dip coating was done gently and the FTO seed coated substrates were annealed at 130 C for 25 min in order to firm binding of seed particles. The seed layered FTO substrates were vertically dipped into the growth solution by exposing the seed-coated FTO facets towards the growth solution. Then samples in the growth solution were covered with the aluminum foil and kept in a preheated electric oven for 5 h at 90 C. Afterward, the samples were taken out and washed several times with the deionized in order to remove unwanted particles from the surface of the nanostructured material grown on the FTO substrates. The samples were annealed at 500 C for 4 h in order to convert the hydroxide phase into composite oxide nanostructures. The same method was used for the collection of powder of mixed transition metal oxide nanostructures. Pristine Co3O4 nanostructures were also prepared by the same method without the addition of copper salt. The synthesis of pristine CuO nanostructures was carried out by the mixing of copper chloride and urea in 100 mL of the deionized water. The FTO substratewas seededwith CuO nanoparticles andwas hanged vertically in the precursor’s the solution at 90 C for 5 h. Then a black layer on the FTOwas found and it indicated the presence of CuO. Likewise, CuO nano-powder was collected by filtration. The morphological features of the nanostructured material were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi model H-800 at an accelerating voltage of 3 kV, while Philips powder X-ray diffraction technique was used to determine the crystalline structure, phase, and purity, and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) technique was used for composition analysis of the as-prepared samples. The electrochemical characterizationwas performed in 1MKOH at room temperature. A catalyst ink of various materials was prepared by dispersing 10 mg powder of each catalyst into 2.5 mL of the deionizedwater and 0.5 mL of 5% Nafion. Prior to the surface modification, the cleaning of glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was done through polishing with 0.05 mm alumina powder and then rubbed with silica and washed several times with the deionized water. The deposition of 10 mL of the catalyst ink on the clean GCE was done via drop casting method. The modified GCE as working electrode, a platinum wire as a counter electrode and silver-silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) saturated with 3M KCl as a reference electrodewas configured into three electrode electrochemical cells. The reference electrode Ag/AgCl was calibrated using 15% hydrogen gas in Argon then bubbled into the 1M KOH electrolyte. The counter Pt electrode and reference electrodeswere connectedwith the two probe multi-meter and potential was recorded. Linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry were used to evaluate the catalytic response and durability of the catalyst. The chronopotentiometry was uses to investigate the stability of electrocatalyst at a constant current density of 10 mA/cm2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was conducted for the investigation of the HER kinetics in a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at an amplitude of 10mV and onset potential of 0.3 V vs RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) in 1M KOH electrolyte. All the potentials are reported into RHE without iR\ndrop. All the experiments were performed at room temperature."

      "text" : "The structural and compositional characterization of various nanostructured materials\nScanning electron microscopy was employed to explore the morphological features of various nanostructured materials. Fig. 1a and b shows the leaf-like features of the CuO nanostructures at different magnifications. The thickness of each leaf is a few hundred nm and they are uniform in distribution on the FTO glass substrate. Fig. 1c and d shows the Co3O4\nnanowires at different magnifications, the length of each nanowire was few microns, and the average diameter of each nanowire is approximately 200 nme500 nm. But the nanowires are not well oriented and randomly distributed on the FTO substrate as clearly seen from Fig. 1c and d. Fig. 1e and f shows the structural features of composite Co3O4eCuO and it exhibited a nanowire like structure. The top surface of the nanowire is very thin and sharp due to the incorporation of copper metal atoms into the cobalt oxide nanowire. The length of the nanowires is several microns and the average diameter is around 100 nme300 nm. The SEM results of the mixed transition metal oxide are clearly indicating that the self-assembly of nanoparticles turned into a nanowire morphology. The sharpness of nanowire for the composite material has more surface area which provide more contact\nifications a-b. pure CuO, c-d. pure Co3O4, e-f. Co3O4eCuO\narea with the electrolyte and thus it accelerates the HER kinetics. The SEM study was carried out on the composite catalyst after stability and durability experiment as shown in S1. It can be seen that composite catalyst has tendency to retain the morphology and a slight top surface of the nanowires is etched due to alkaline nature of the electrolyte. The elemental composition of each sample was investigated by the energy dispersive spectroscopy. The elemental mapping of the pristine CuO and Co3O4 was also carried out as shown in the supplementary data in Figs. S2 and S3. In the CuO sample, the Cu and O are the main components derived from the CuO and in a sample of the Co3O4, Co and O are inherently visible. In both samples, Sn is involved from the FTO substrate. Fig. 2a shows the elemental mapping of Co3O4eCuO samples and it indicates the uniform distribution of Co, O, and Cu in the nanowire morphology. The contribution of Sn is also visible, and it is coming from the FTO substrate. The relative amount of Co, O, and Cu is presented in the EDS spectrum as shown in Fig. 2b. Importantly, the amount of Co and Cu in the composite\nFig. 2 e EDS elemental mapping a Co3O4eCuO compos\nmaterial has shown significant role in the HER process and it opens the gate way for the development of functional catalysts based on the CueCo systems.\nThe crystal structure of various nanostructured materials on the FTO substrate was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 3aec describe the diffraction patterns of the CuO, Co3O4, and composite Co3O4eCuO at 2q range of 10e80 . All the materials exhibit sharp peaks, which indicate their high crystalline quality. Four different diffraction patterns are also identified for the FTO substrate as shown in Fig. 3aec. The diffraction patterns of pure CuO are well matched to the standard JCPDS card no.96-900-8962 and the material exhibits monoclinic phase. The Co3O4 nanowire reflection peaks are in good agreement with the standard JCPDS card no.96-900-5890 and it has a cubic phase. Themixed transition metal oxide sample has shown well-resolved diffraction patterns for both Co3O4 and CuO and they are fully supported by the standard JCPDS cards of pristine Co3O4 and CuO cases. The incorporation of CuO into the Co3O4\nite oxide, b EDS spectrum. Co3O4eCuO composite.\nnanowires has shown the suppression of intensity for the reflection peaks of cobalt oxide which might induce the defects in the crystal structure of composite materials, and they could be responsible for the favorable HER process. No other impurity was found in all the samples.\nThe XPS characterization was carried out on the composite Co3O4eCuO sample. Thewide scan survey spectra confirm the presence of Co, Cu, and O in the sample as shown in Fig. 4a. The Co2p XPS spectrum is shown in Fig. 4b that indicates the satellite peaks at the binding energies of 795.06 eV and 779.68 eV related to Co2p3/2, and Co2p1/2, respectively. The spin-orbit energy difference between them is 15 eV which is indexed to the Co2þ valence state [58]. Fig. 4c shows two peaks at binding energies of 529.66 eV which is the characteristic peak for the metal-oxygen bonds and another peak at 531.01 eV that is attributed to the presence of surface oxygen vacancies [59,60]. Fig. 4d shows the oxidation states of the Cu investigated by the high-resolution Cu2p spectrum that contains shake-up satellite peaks which confirms the typical features of CuO [61e64]. Further, the existence of CuO in the composite sample is verified by the binding energies of the Cu2p3/2 and the Cu2p1/2measured at 933.66 eV and 953.65 eV, respectively [62e66]. The XPS results revealed that the composite is successfully obtained and that it is completely in good agreement with the XRD results. Furthermore, XPS technique was used to investigate the composition of the pristine cobalt oxide and CuO as shown in S4 and it confirms the presence of Co, Cu and O as main elements and no other element was detected. No, any other impurity was found in the sample during the XPS characterization. Based on the XPS\nresults, it is confirmed that incorporation of Cu into the Co3O4 nanowires has tune its electronic properties, thus HER activity is strongly increased.\nHER activity of the newly developed composite Co3O4eCuO electro-catalyst\nHER activity of the Co3O4eCuO mixed transition metal oxide was evaluated in an alkaline solution. Various catalysts were deposited on the GCE and it was configured into the electrochemical cell as a working electrode. The performance of the mixed transition metal oxide was compared with that of the pristine Co3O4 and CuO and noble catalyst 20% Pt/C. Linear sweep voltammetry was used to record the HER polarization curves at a scan rate of 5mV/s. CuO is not active for HER due to its high over-potential, but the Co3O4 has shown poor HER activity. However, composite Co3O4eCuO has shown significant enhancement in the HER activity at the low potential that is close to the noble Pt/C catalyst as shown in Fig. 5a. A current density of 10 mA/cm2 is achieved at the potential of 0.288 V vs RHE which is very comparable to the recently reported CoO based catalysts [67].\nThe HER mechanism on the surface of the metal oxide proceeds through either VolmereHeyrovsky or VolmereTafel mechanism in alkaline media [68].\n*þH2Oþe #H*þOH *þH2Oþe #H*þOH (Volmer reaction: Discharge step 1\nH*þH2Oþe # H2þOH (Heyrovsky: Desorption step reaction 2\nand 2H* # H2 Tafel: Recombination step, Here * is the active site). 3\nThe Tafel slope values of 120, 40 and 30 mV dec 1 are associated to Volmer reaction, Heyrovsky reaction, and Tafel reaction, respectively.\nIt is proved that the transitionmetal oxides are not suitable catalysts for transforming the H* to H2 due to strong H* adsorption on the O, but relatively weak H* adsorption on metal ion [53,54,57]. However, they have demonstrated very well for the cleavage of OHeH bond in the Volmer step [59,62,55 and 69]. Recently, a publishedwork on CoO nanorods [67] has Tafel slope of 82 mVdec 1. But the proposed catalyst based on composite Co3O4eCuO has smaller Tafel slope value of 65 mVdec 1 as shown in Fig. 5b. It follows that the Volmer Heyrovsky mechanism further confirms that the desorption step (Heyrovsky reaction) is the rate-determining step during the HER process. Similarly, the Co3O4 has shown Heyrovsky Volmer mechanism and exhibited a Tafel slope of 94 mVdec 1 which is comparable to that of reported work [67]. The Pt/C has Tafel slope of 49 mVdec 1 and it follows the VolmereHeyrovsky reaction mechanism. The Tafel slope of GCE and CuO are 328 mVdec 1 and 243mVdec 1, respectively. These are very large in magnitude due to self-resistance offered by the material and the electrode [70,71]. Looking into the consideration of the SEM and the XRD results, it is obvious that the Co3O4eCuO has less intense reflections for cobalt oxide when compared to the pristine Co3O4. This\nsuggests that crystal defects might enhance the HER activity and SEM study has also shown that nanowires of mixedmetal oxide are thinner than the pristine cobalt oxide with large catalytic sites and surface areawhich are in great contact with the electrolyte and favors the active HER process. Additionally, the EDS study confirms that Co is replaced by copper in mixed transition metal oxide sample as shown in Fig. 2b and\nthe presence of Co and Cu in the mixed transition metal oxide synergistically enhance the HER activity. It is true that the content of Co and Cu is low in the mixed sample as shown in Fig. 2b when compared to the amount of Co and Cu in the pristine samples as shown in S2eS3. In the composite sample, some of the cobalt atoms are replaced by copper, thus the presence of two transition metals i, e. cobalt and copper\npossibly generated synergetic effect in the oxide phase, thus superior HER performance is demonstrated. This further emphasizes that the relative amount of Co and Cu in the sample\ncan alter the HER activity which needs to optimize for the development of future generation of HER catalysts. Moreover, the copper concertation in the composite has tendency to\nTable 1 e The fitted values for the elements of equivalent circuit.\nSample Rs (Ohm) Rct (Ohm) CPE (mF)\nCo3O4eCuO 2.82 173.20 1.97 Co3O4 2.04 384.50 0.85 CuO 2.25 656.90 0.35\nlower the adsorption energies of atomic hydrogen [72] and consequently faster HER is demonstrated.\nThe stability of the composite based HER catalyst was evaluated for 3 h via chronopotentiometry as shown in Fig. 6a. The response of catalyst is highly stable, and it showed a negligible potential drop with time. Thus, we assume that this catalyst can be used for widespread applications. In addition, the durability of the Co3O4eCuO catalyst was investigated through cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 10mV/s and after 2000 cycles of CV, the LSV response in terms of potential shift was found to be negligible as shown in Fig. 6b. The considerable stability and durability of composite catalyst gives alternative possibility to replace the precious Pt-based catalysts for hydrogen production.\nTo make a deeper insight on the HER kinetics, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz in 1M KOH solution at the onset potential of 0.3 V RHE and an amplitude of 10 mV. The Nyquist plots and the equivalent circuit (as an inset) are shown in Fig. 7a. Also, the bode plots are developed using same EIS data as shown in Fig. 7b and c. The fitted resistance valuesare summarized in Table 1. This equivalent electric circuit contains the solution resistance (Rs), Faradaic charge-transfer resistance of HER (Rct), and the double-layer capacitance (Cdl). As shown in Fig. 7, the Rct (173.2U) for CuOeCo3O4 is apparently smaller and thehigher Cdl (1.97mF) compared to the pristine CuO andCo3O4 suggesting a decrease in the HER resistance and consequently favorable HER catalytic activity in alkaline solution is demonstrated [73e75]. The performance of the developed electrocatalyst is superior the recently reported HER catalysts in terms of Tafel slope and at low potential of 0.288 V for the current density of 10 mA/cm2 as given in Table S1."

      "text" : "This study indicates that the incorporation of copper into the precursors of Co3O4 nanowires can activate the cobalt oxide material into a highly efficient electro-catalyst toward HER. The composite Co3O4eCuO has performance comparable to the best HER catalysts reported in alkaline media. The addition of copper did not change the morphology of Co3O4, but it tuned the electronic, catalytic sites and consequently excellent HER performance is achieved. The performance of the proposed catalyst in terms of Tafel slope, approximately 65 mVdec 1, and to produce 10 mA/cm2 current density at a low potential of 0.288 V vs RHE are showing an advancement in the catalyst design based on Co3O4 materials for HER. The Co3O4eCuOmaterial has shown a good stability and durability in an alkaline solution. The EIS results have shown that the HER is highly favorable on the Co3O4eCuO surface due to the\nsmaller charge transfer resistance and higher capacitance values. These results provide new horizons for the development of a future generation of high-performance cobalt based electro-catalysts. Also this functional material can be capitalized into diverse energy storage systems."

    "abstractText" : "In this study, we incorporate a copper impurity into (Co3O4) nanowires precursor that turn them into an active catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction in 1M KOH. The XRD and XPS results are in good agreement and confirmed the formation of Co3O4eCuO nanocomposite by wet chemical method. To date, the performance of hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline for the composite catalyst is comparable or superior to cobalt oxide based HER electro-catalysts. The HER catalyst exhibits the lowest Tafel slope of 65 mVdec 1 for the cobalt-based catalysts in alkaline media. A current density of 10 mA/cm is achieved at a potential of 0.288 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The mixed transition metal oxide Co3O4eCuO based HER electro-catalyst is highly stable and durable. The EIS results demonstrates that HER is highly favorable on the Co3O4eCuO due to the relatively small charge transfer resistance (173.20 Ohm) and higher capacitance values (1.97 mF). © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.
