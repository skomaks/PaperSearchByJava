      "text" : "In comparison with their bulk counterparts, two-dimensional (2D) layered nanomaterials have unique physiochemical and structural properties because of their high aspect ratios, quantum-size effects and unusual surface chemistry.1–3 Since the discovery of graphene,4–7 2D layered nanomaterials have received much attention. Especially, the vast library of 2D layered nanomaterials has attracted tremendous interest. The past few decades have witnessed an explosive growth in the scientic research on various 2D layered nanomaterials, including transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),8 graphitic carbon nitride,9–11 hexagonal boron nitride,12 layered double hydroxides,13 silicone,14 germanene,15 2D metals,16 2D metal oxides and sulphides,17,18 transition metal carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides (MXenes),19–22 2D polymers,23 2D metal– organic frameworks (MOFs),24–26 2D covalent-organic frameworks,27,28 2D perovskites,29,30 and others.31,32 A principal reason for the exploration of 2D nanomaterials is that monolayer (ML) materials have increased bandgaps and tunable electronic, optical, catalytic and electrochemical properties. 2D nanomaterials have great prospects for modern nanoscience and nanotechnology, showing wide applications in the optical, electronic, optoelectronic and biomedical elds. The majority of 2D layered nanomaterials are rediscovered and contemporary\nYujiao Sun was born in 1995.

Except for graphene and its counterparts, abundant binary, ternary or complex materials with 2D layered structures are exfoliated to ML or few layers. However, the number of anisotropic layered materials is very limited.\nIn recent years, scientic research interests have turned to 2D monoelemental structures, including layered black phosphorus (BP) and phosphorene and its cousins (arsenene, antimonene, and bismuthene). As a new member of the 2D layered nanomaterial family, group-VA (P, As, Sb, and Bi) nanomaterials with 2D layered monoelemental structures have emerged with increasing interest, strong momentum in their development and great potential applications.37–40 Unlike semimetallic groupIVA (graphene, silicene, germanene, and stanine) and metallic group-IIIA borophene materials, 2D layered group-VA monoelemental nanomaterials are semiconductors with marked and fundamental band gaps, which endow them with a great potential as promising candidates for future nanodevices. The transition from metallic conductors to semiconductors can be regulated by reducing the layer number of materials, accompanied by optical, electronic and electrocatalytic properties different from those of their bulk counterparts. This is an important aspect of the materials, which deserves further investigations. As an emerging star of post-graphene 2D layered nanomaterials, phosphorene and 2D layered BP materials have been largely studied in recent years.41–64 Their tunable direct bandgap, charge-carrier mobility and unique in-plane anisotropic structures render them signicant in a broad range of research elds.\nSince graphene was isolated by Novoselov et al.,4 graphene studies have achieved extraordinary scientic success,5 opening the door to new groups of 2D materials with complementary physical properties to graphene.65,66 Graphene is a semimetal without a band gap, which restrains its practical use in the electronic and optoelectronic elds. In the research of novel 2D materials, generally TMDs are dominant since most of them have a band gap in the range of 1.5–2.5 eV,67 which can be tuned by adjusting the layer number, stress level and chemical functionalization. However, this band gap range is not appropriate\nZejun Sun was born in 1996. Since 2018, she has been a Master's candidate in the College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Qingdao University.

Phosphorene (2D allotrope of BP) suffers from strong reactivity under environment conditions. The exfoliated akes of phosphorene are very oxophilic and can form a hydrophilic BP surface. This process facilitates moisture uptake from air to form phosphoric acid and related species, leading to the degradation of BP akes.69 Hence, the discovery and production of novel 2D materials with proper bandgaps and stability under atmospheric conditions are challenging. Recently, the eld of monoelemental nanomaterials related to 2D layered As, Sb and Bi (few-layer or ML arsenene, antimonene, and bismuthene) has become one of the most developing and popular research elds.70–112 Building on early studies,113–117 currently, there are considerable studies on 2D layered As, Sb, and Bi nanomaterials in the literature, which explore their various synthetic methods, fundamental properties and functional nanostructures for promising applications.\nThe crystallization of heavy pnictogens (As, Sb, and Bi) results in a rhombohedral (b-form) layered structure,118 which is the most stable allotropic of pnictogen elements. Anisotropy is visible on the cleaved crystals. As and Sb have the highest anisotropies of physical properties.39 Rhombohedral structures of As and other pnictogens are related to the structure of BP consisting of puckered, six-membered rings of atoms, but the individual layers are held together by stronger interactions. Different from BP, 2D (As, Sb and Bi) materials do not generate true van der Waals-bonded layered structures. The difference between BP and products with rhombohedral modications (gray As, Sb and metallic Bi) comes from the interactions of the atomic orbitals between individual double layers. The difference between the in-plane and out-of-plane interatomic distance is substantially high, resulting in layered structures with anisotropy.39 The interlayer interactions cause semimetal behavior. The (As, Sb, and Bi) elements with metallic sheen serve as superior conductors. With themost thermodynamically stable rhombohedral structures, pnictogen materials are brittle and easily pulverized. This unique property is suitable for the top-down preparation of few-layer and ML materials through mechanical exfoliation.\nBefore proceeding with this review, here we investigate the recent reviews relative to 2D group-VA nanomaterials. Pumera et al. reported a short review on the structures and properties of 2D monoelemental arsenene, antimonene and bismuthene.39 Ares et al. reported the recent progress on antimonene as a new bidimensional material, focusing on theoretical work and experimental realizations.40 Gablech et al. discussed the development of eld-effect transistor-based sensors using 2D arsenene and antimonene.119 Wang et al. reported a mini-review to summarize the experimental preparation and practical applications of antimonene.120 Zhang et al. explored the theoretical and experimental progress in 2D group-VA semiconductors.37 Ye et al. reviewed bismuth-based photocatalysts for solar photocatalytic carbon dioxide conversion.121 Xu et al. summarized 2D bismuth-based layered materials for energy-\n25714 | J.

With respect to 2D-layer structural As, Sb and Bi materials, there are a rapidly increasing number of publications involving in the emerging and popular research eld of 2D layered group-VA nanomaterials in recent years (Scheme 1), which provide relevant researchers strong motivation and a high necessity for this timely and comprehensive review.\nHerein, this present review comprehensively introduces the state-of-the-art current research in 2D layered group-VA monoelemental nanomaterials beyond BP. This review covers 2D layered (As, Sb, and Bi) nanomaterials, few-layer, their ML counterparts (arsenene, antimonene, and bismuthene) and functionalized nanostructures (hybridization, doping, and functionalization). This review is divided into four sections, mainly including synthetic methods, properties, functional nanostructures and applications. We systematically summarize each section based on both theoretical predictions and experimental studies. We summarize the different synthetic methods for these 2D materials, including mechanical, sonication, electrochemical exfoliation, hydrothermal, solvothermal synthesis, and epitaxial growth. Then, we highlight their unique band structures, carrier transport, mechanical, optical, electronic, thermal and magnetic properties. Moreover, various functional nanostructures are discussed, including different heterostructures, doping, adsorption, hybrid and functionalized nanostructures based on these 2D layeredmaterials. Finally, the broad range of promising applications of these 2D materials is elaborated, including various signicant elds such as catalysis, energy storage, eld-effect transistors, topological spintronic devices, electronic devices, nonlinear photonics, light-emitting devices, gas sensors, thermoelectric materials and\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\n2 3\nO ct\nob er\n2 01\n9.

      "text" : "2.1.1. Mechanical exfoliation. The pnictogens (As, Sb, and Bi) with rhombohedral structures are very brittle, easily pulverized and exfoliated by top-down methods, such as ultrasonication and mechanical operations. Arsenene, antimonene and bismuthene were theoretically predicted,123,124 and examples of their synthesis have been widely reported.39 The Scotchtape method is applied for b-As (rhombohedral) with high anisotropy. Grey Sb was exfoliated down to few layers through mechanical exfoliation.95 Single- or few-layered b-arsenene (antimonene and bismuthene) was prepared through liquidphase exfoliation (LPE) and bottom-up methods.39,40 However, methods for the large-scale preparation of single- and fewlayered pnictogen nanosheets are limited (Table 1).\nShear exfoliation of layered materials in the liquid phase is oen conducted using rotating blades mixers. Even household kitchen blenders can be used when the exfoliation process is conducted in aqueous surfactants, similar to sonication exfoliation. Gusmão et al. applied a shear force mixer to exfoliate nanosheets of rhombohedral layered As, Sb and Bi.70 Bulk\nScheme 2 Schematic illustration of this review, involving synthesis methods, fundamental properties, functional nanostructures and potential applications of 2D layered group-VA nanomaterials beyond black phosphorus.\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\ncrystals of pnictogens were subjected to shear dispersion and exfoliation in the presence of aqueous surfactants (sodium cholate) using two types of kitchen blenders. The liquid-phase shear, turbulence and collisions led to gentle lateral force for self-lubricating exfoliation of the starting materials, followed by centrifugation at low rotational speeds to separate the poorly exfoliated materials in the sediment and the exfoliated nanosheets in the surfactant suspension (supernatant). Aer shear exfoliation, the supernatant was subjected to aqueous washing and centrifugation to achieve pnictogens. The preparation of pnictogens allows the use of kitchen blenders, rendering it a green, accessible and up-scalable method, without the need for purged media and a glove box.\nWang et al. reported a pre-grinding and sonication-assisted LPE to prepare antimonene.78 In the presence of 2-butanol, mortar pre-grinding with a mortar provided shear force along the layer surface to produce large and thin Sb plates that were easily exfoliated into smooth and large-scale antimonene, which avoided long sonication time and antimonene destruction (Fig. 1a). Antimonene was gained aer centrifugation. The low X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak at 23.7 (corresponding to the 003 facet) indicated the successful exfoliation of the bulk Sb crystals into Sb plates through pre-grinding. The diminished peaks from the 003 and 006 facets suggested that the exfoliation occurred along the c-axis to produce antimonene (Fig. 1b). The exfoliated antimonene had a smooth and ake-like morphology in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1c), and its surface was principally enclosed by {001} facets, as proven by the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1d). Its lattice fringes had an interplanar distance of 0.36 nm.104 LPE produced antimonene with a wide layer distribution. Different layered structures of antimonene were gained by centrifugation, with a remarkable Tyndall phenomenon. An increase in centrifugation speed yielded thinner antimonene with a lower yield and higher stability. This tendency was veried by Raman spectra measurements to characterize the 2D materials and provide details of their vibrational and rotational modes. The two peaks observed at 110 and 141.6 cm 1 are due to the Eg and A1g vibration modes of the bulk Sb crystals, respectively (Fig. 1e). Aer pre-grinding into Sb plates, the peaks blue-shied and shied to larger wavenumbers with an increase in the centrifugation speed. This trend indicated that antimonene became ultra-thin. Aer pre-grinding and increasing the centrifugation speed, the peak intensity became weaker and close to that of micro-mechanically exfoliated Sb sheets. Weak peak intensities in Raman signals are due to a reduction in ake thickness. The Raman peaks at 180 and 250 cm 1 result from Sb(III) and (V) oxide, indicating the partial oxidization of the bulk Sb crystals before their preparation.98\nAres et al. prepared few-layered b-antimonene (FL-Sb) akes.92 They started with mechanical exfoliation of freshly cleaved macroscopic Sb crystals by repetitive peeling with adhesive tape, accompanied by transfer of the Sb sheets from adhesive tape to thin layers of viscoelastic polymer. Another transfer was performed by pressing the polymer against SiO2/Si substrates. The tape was not pressed against the substrate, and there was less adhesive. This double-step strategy allowed for\nJ. Mater. Chem.

Then the microcrystalline powder was suspended in an isopropanol– water (4 : 1) mixture, which was sonicated to produce a stable FL-antimonene suspension under ambient conditions. The unexfoliated material was removed through centrifugation to form a stable suspension with a high concentration of FL-bismuthene.97,98 Before sonochemical exfoliation, bulk Bi was rstly grinded into Bi powder in isopropyl alcohol or ethanol. The prepared Bi solution was placed in spiral glass bottle under an ice-bath and probe sonication. The suspension was centrifuged to separate the precipitates and supernatant suspension containing FL-antimonene.\n2D layered As, Sb and Bi nanomaterials with hybrid, doping and functionalized nanostructures were prepared by\n25718 | J.

The lumps were cleaved with a razor blade to remove the outer surface that was contaminated with O2 from the atmosphere. The Sb2Te3 nanosheets extracted by micro-mechanical exfoliation were transferred on a substrate with embedded interdigitated electrodes. Teweldebrhan et al. explored the cleavage of bulk Bi2Te3 into thin crystalline lms.111 Aer mechanical cleavage exfoliation, the thin lm from the crystalline bulk Bi2Te3 was separated to obtain layered counterparts with few atomic planes. Layered black arsenic–phosphorus (b-AsP) materials were mechanically exfoliated into thin akes down to atomic layers.76 Bulk b-AsxP1 x (x: 0–0.83) samples with nominal compositions were prepared by a vapor transport method and exfoliated into akes using Scotch tape.\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\n2 3\nO ct\nob er\n2 01\n9.

Epitaxial growth and mechanical exfoliation with viscoelastic stamps or kitchen blenders, or straightforward LPE have some drawbacks, such as low yields and time-consuming operations. The combination of mortar pre-grinding and sonication-assisted LPE promotes the achievement of smooth and large-scale 2D layered pnictogen materials. The initial pregrinding of bulk crystals provides shear force along layer surfaces to form thin plates. The LPE of plates into smooth large layered materials is conducted, which assists with sonication, and thus long sonication time and destruction of atomically thin layered materials can be avoided. Layered materials with uniform and specic numbers of layers are achieved aer centrifugation treatment. Pnictogen materials with high-quality layered structures promote experimental studies on thicknessdependent bandgaps, which can pave the way for the widespread applications of 2D pnictogen materials in electronics, optoelectronics and smart nanodevices.\n2.1.2. Ultrasonic exfoliation. In the case of 2D layered materials, the quality of materials prepared frommechanical or micromechanical exfoliation is quite limited, restraining their potential applications.95 LPE is very practical due to its ability in yielding large-scale, few-layer or ML 2D materials.132–135 LPE has been used to generate several 2Dmaterials on a large scale, such as few-layer BP.133,136 Generally, bulk crystals are immersed into mixed solvents without surfactants, followed by sonication to generate a stable suspension of micrometer-large, few-layer 2D nanomaterials under ambient conditions. Sonication-assisted LPE has been widely applied to prepare few-layer pnictogen sheets with high productivity and superior properties.\nTian et al. prepared 2D few-layer antimonene in a large quantity by LPE of b-Sb in the mixed (1/1, v/v) solvent of ethanol and N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) without surfactants.85 The pregrinded b-Sb powder was treated by ultrasonic exfoliation at 200 W for 5–6 h. The mixture was centrifuged to remove the unexfoliated Sb. The dark-grey suspension containing few-layer antimonene was collected and centrifuged, followed by rinsing with ethanol and freeze-drying under vacuum. Few-layer antimonene nanoakes were prepared by LPE.87 Bulk Sb was exfoliated in NMP by bath-ultrasonication (40 kHz operating frequency, 100% power) for 4 h. The prepared nanoakes were water-soluble and had lateral dimensions from ten nanometers to micrometers. Sonication (400 W, 24 kHz, 40 min) of Sb crystals in an isopropanol–water (4/1, v/v) mixture without surfactants resulted in a stable suspension of antimonene over\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nweeks under ambient conditions.94 The non-exfoliated materials were removed by centrifugation to form a stable dispersion containing antimonene. Antimonene on the micrometer-scale had high quality and few-layer nanosheet structures. Zhang et al. prepared antimonene nanosheets via LPE assisted with sonication, which was a fast and direct method to prepare a high-quality dispersion of few-layer antimonene.82,94 Due to the on-surface isolation and hypo-toxicity, no surfactant was required upon exfoliation and ultra-pure ethanol was used as the solvent. Sb crystals were ground using an agate mortar into a powder, which was then dispersed in ethanol under stirring, followed by sonication for 3 h to exfoliate the antimonene nanosheets. Aer the dispersion settled to precipitate large grains, the supernatant was centrifuged to collect the antimonene nanosheets.\nBi nanosheets was prepared from Bi powder (200 meshes) by sonication (Fig. 2a).137 Bi powder was added to a glass bottle with 300 mL of pure NMP, followed by ice-bath sonication (70% power, 600W) for 6 h, probe sonication (60% power, 1800W) for 24 h and an additional ice-bath sonication for 6 h. Aer centrifugation, Bi nanosheets were achieved. Bi was easily oxidized to a-Bi2O3 upon exposure to ambient conditions (oxygen and water).138 NMP was used as the solvent during the exfoliation process. NMP is a superior organic solvent for 2D material exfoliation and can prevent the oxidization of Bi atoms. The exfoliated Bi nanosheets had a uniformly distributed lateral dimension (Fig. 2b and c) and an intact lamellar structure aer sonication (Fig. 2d and e). The HRTEM image indicated a lattice spacing of 0.22 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane of Bi. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mappings from the TEM images were in accordance with the Bi morphology at exact locations (Fig. 2f). The crystal structures were characterized by XRD (Fig. 2g). Bi nanosheets are hexagonal nanocrystals without detectable impurity of other phases.139 Upon excitation with a 325 nm laser, Raman peaks were observed at 65.6 and 92 cm 1 (Fig. 2h), corresponding to the Eg and A1g vibration modes of Bi.75,138 A broad absorption regime was observed in the absorption spectra (Fig. 2i), which is in good agreement with the characteristics of Bi nanosheets.97 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements indicated the lamellar Bi sheets had a thickness of 6–12 nm, implying few-layer Bi nanosheet structures.\n2D group-VA pnictogen materials with functional nanostructures were prepared by ultrasonic exfoliation. Huang et al. prepared Bi2S3 nanosheets based on sonication-assisted LPE.106 Bulk Bi2S3 was ground with NMP in an agate mortar. Aer grinding for 40 min, the Bi2S3/NMP suspension was treated by probe sonication (650 W, 3 h), followed by bath sonication (400 W, 48 h) at 5 C. The nal suspension was obtained by centrifugation, and the supernatant suspension containing Bi2S3 nanosheets was gently collected. Wang et al. synthesized smooth and large antimonene with uniform 2D layers using pre-grinding and sonication-assisted LPE.78 The mortar pregrinding provided shear force along the layer surfaces to form large Sb thin plates, which were exfoliated into smooth and large antimonene, avoiding long sonication time and antimonene destruction. Similarly, FL-Sb was prepared via\nJ. Mater. Chem. A, 2019, 7, 25712–25771 | 25719\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\n2 3\nO ct\nob er\n2 01\n9.

Besides, few-layer bismuthene was obtained by sono-chemical exfoliation.97,98 Bulk Bi was ground into Bi powder with isopropanol. The Bi solution was placed in spiral glass bottle and kept under ice-bath and probe sonication. The suspension was centrifuged to collect the supernatant containing bismuthene.\nThe pre-grinding of bulk crystals is important for the production of nanosheets since it rst produces plate structures\nFig. 2 (a) Scheme of the proposed hydrothermal preparation of Bi nanosh (SEM) images.

A, 2019, 7, 25712–25771\nthat are easily transformed into high-quality 2D layered materials. The thinness of the plates formed from pre-grinding improves the efficiency of exfoliation. Thus, the pre-grinding pretreatment of bulk crystals into thin plates before sonication-assisted LPE is suitable for the preparation of 2D layered materials with high-quality, few-layer and ML structures. This strategy promotes the preparation of 2D group-VA pnictogen materials and their counterparts with hybrid, doping and functional nanostructures. Furthermore, both pregrinding and sonication are accompanied with the abundant release of heat, and thus ice-bath sonication or low-temperature\neets.

Organic solvents (NMP, isopropanol, and ethanol) are used as starting materials and stabilizers for the preparation of 2D pnictogen materials.79,84 At a higher sonication power, bulk crystals or powder are broken into smaller (in lateral, height, and thickness) sized 2D materials. Also, an extension in sonication time benets the achievement of fewlayer or ML 2D materials.\n2.1.3. Electrochemical exfoliation. Few-layer pnictogen nanosheets are prepared from bulk crystals based on cathodic exfoliation. This method is simple, economic, environmentally friendly and efficient for the mass production of classic 2D materials, including graphene and TMDs.140–144 Li et al. prepared few-layer Sb nanosheets from bulk Sb crystals through cathodic exfoliation.104 In their experiments,89,104 a two-electrode electrochemical cell was used for exfoliation. An intact small bulk Sb with high purity and crystallinity was connected to the conducting copper wire as the cathode. Bulk Sb as the working electrode was partially placed in electrolyte to avoid electrolysis and contamination of the connected conducting wire. Pt wire (foil) with a size of 0.5 mm served as the counter electrode and the anode, and 0.2–0.5MNa2SO4 aqueous solution served as the supporting electrolyte (Fig. 3a). A direct current potential with a constant voltage of 6 V or 10 V was applied between the Sb and Pt electrodes to drive electrochemical exfoliation. This process was maintained for 1 h to ensure the complete\nFig. 3 Characterization of multilayer antimonene.

Aer centrifugation of the electrolyte containing the exfoliated Sb nanoakes, the sediment was washed through ultrasonication in water. The dispersion was dried at 60 C for 24 h under vacuum and then diluted in NMP.\nThe anions of the supporting electrolyte had little impact on the exfoliation process. Cations with larger (Cs+) or smaller (Li+) sizes compared to the interplanar spacing of Sb crystals reduced the lateral sizes of the nanoakes. In the AFM images of the electrochemically exfoliated few-layer antimonene, the nanoake presented a height of 31.6 nm (Fig. 3b), with smooth surfaces and irregular proles. The nanoake had a lateral size of 10.3 mm and a rigid arrangement of lattice planes (Fig. 3c and d). The inter-distance of lattice fringe was 0.228 nm, in accordance with the (100) interplanar distance of rhombohedral gray Sb.93 The Raman spectra of the multilayer rhombohedral antimonene nanoakes ( 31.6 nm) indicated that the peak positions of Eg and A1 were blue-shied to 113.8 and 150.9 cm\n1, respectively, showing a reduced intensity ratio due to the thickness reduction produced from electrochemical exfoliation (Fig. 3e). The reduced intensity ratio was due to the fast intensity attenuation in the interplanar A1 vibration modes compared to the in-plane Eg vibration modes.93 The XPS spectra (Fig. 3f) had a sharp symmetric photoelectron peak at 528 eV,\nctrode system used for the electrochemical exfoliation of Sb, using bulk ounter electrode and electrolyte, respectively.

The mono-peak implied the non-oxidation feature of few-layer antimonene.\nThe quality of 2D layered pnictogen nanomaterials from mechanical exfoliation is limited, which restricts their largescale applications.95 Multi-layered antimonene nanoribbons were prepared from a plasma-assisted process at room temperature, which became non-continuous and showed a pile of multilayer nanoribbons.96 Few-layered antimonene monocrystalline polygons can be prepared on various substrates via van der Waals epitaxial growth.93 However, the structural variety of the cleaved surface is limited and is hard to handle.145 Epitaxial growth was used to prepare few-layered antimonene;93 however, the scalability of the method needs to be further improved. Electrochemical exfoliation is considered a facile and scalable approach to obtain large-scale nanomaterials. This approach with unique merits over conventional synthetic methods is suitable for the mass generation of 2D materials.146 In contrast to mechanical exfoliation, molecular assembly and chemical vapor deposition, the electrochemical method is inexpensive for mass production and avoids the use of harsh\n25722 | J. Mater. Chem. A, 2019, 7, 25712–25771\nchemicals through electrochemical activation, resulting in simple purication steps. However, electrochemical exfoliation needs to satisfy high requirements for the large-size production of 2D materials, which are realized in the electrochemical exfoliation production of graphene,142 MoS2,147 phosphorene,148 etc. Besides high quality and large-scale production in a costeffective route, the electrochemical exfoliation of 2D layered pnictogen materials is desirable for applications.89,104\n2.1.4. Plasma-assisted process. Tsai et al. explored a plasma-assisted process to obtain multilayer graphene on 4HSiC, showing good electronic properties.149 As a mature technique, the plasma-assisted process was expanded to prepare multilayer germanene on SiGe/Si and multilayer violet phosphorene on InP.150,151 Multilayer arsenene was prepared on InAs via the plasma-assisted process.77 Multilayer arsenene is not actually continuous, similar to a pile of multilayer nanoribbons. Based on the concept of the plasma-assisted process, nitrogen ions are introduced into InAs, and then react with indium and squeeze arsenic atoms out of the surface to produce arsenene layers during thermal treatment. The synthetic process can be\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\n2 3\nO ct\nob er\n2 01\n9.

The crosssectional layer nanostructure was characterized by TEM. SiO2 was deposited on the surface using an electron beam evaporator to protect the thin lm from damage from the focus ion beam during the preparation of the TEM samples. Under high magnication, a heterogeneous structure was clearly observed, which consisted of three parts, including multilayer arsenene, InN and the InAs substrate (Fig. 4a). The (110) interplanar distance ( 0.43 nm) of InAs was consistent with that ( 0.428 nm) of the theoretical atomic models (Fig. 4b). The InN layer resulted from the reaction between nitrogen ions and indium in InAs. Also, the InN layer was strained and served as a buffer layer to match the lattice of multilayer arsenene with that of InAs.\nDiffraction patterns (inset of Fig. 4a) were measured by fast Fourier transform to derive the interplanar distances of multilayer arsenene. Two groups of reciprocal lattice points were selected for computation of the typical interplanar distances of plane groups, which were close to 0.286 and 0.181 nm, corresponding to the (110) and (01 1) interplanar distances (Fig. 4b) of rhombohedral gray As, respectively. The angle between the two lines represents the (110) and (01 1) plane groups in the diffraction patterns, which is close to that between the (110) and (01 1) plane groups in the real lattices, respectively. The top layer was identied as multilayer arsenene. A plasma-assisted process was used to prepare multilayer antimonene on InSb (Fig. 4c and d).96 The multilayer antimonene was non-continuous, similar to a pile of multilayer nanoribbons. The formation mechanism of multilayer antimonene was interpreted as follows. Intrinsic InSb (001) substrate acted as the template, and Sb element acted as the source for multilayer antimonene formation. The InSb substrates were immersed in N2 plasma produced by a radio frequency (13.56 MHz) system with 50–200 W of power for 30– 60 min at 10 1 Torr. Aer plasma immersion, the samples were annealed at 450 C in an N2/H2 (10/1, v/v) atmosphere for 30–60 min. N2 was mixed with H2 to prevent Sb oxidation caused by the leakage of O2. Raman analysis was used to verify the formation of antimonene layers. The surface composition was analyzed by XPS. Spherical-aberration corrected TEM with 0.1 nm resolution of the lattice image was used to observe the layer nanostructure.\nUpon the use of the plasma-assisted process to prepare 2D layered materials, the Eg peak of gray As or Sb appears, which becomes more intense by extending the exposure time. Thus, the thickness of gray As or Sb prepared from the plasmaassisted process can be tuned by altering the exposure time. Also, the nitrogen content (near InAs or InSb surface) increases with an increase in plasma exposure time because of ion accumulation. The content prole is broadened by internal ion diffusion during annealing. The amount of As or Sb atoms squeezed onto the surface increases, forming a thicker gray As or Sb. In experiments, the plasma-assisted process to prepare arsenene/antimonene layers starts from nitrogen plasma immersion with high power, followed by annealing at high temperature for a short time.77,96\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\n2.1.5. Hot-pressing method. Hussain et al. developed a cost-effective mechanical way to produce ultrathin Bi nanosheets (BiNSs) with high crystalline metallic Bi.72 Using large thermos-compression, ultrathin BiNSs were deposited on polished Si substrates from pristine Bi nanoparticles (BiNPs) via a facile hot-pressing method (Fig. 5a). The BiNP dispersion in ethanol was dropped on an Si substrate. Aer drying, the BiNPs were sandwiched between two Si substrates. Then the pair was placed in the middle of steel plates from the hot-press machine. The temperature of the plates increased from room temperature to 150 C. The pressure was increased from atmospheric pressure to 0.54 GPa. The Si substrates were pressed for 30 min at 150 C, followed by natural cooling to room temperature at a constant pressure of 0.54 GPa. A low operation temperature was selected to avoid oxide formation. In any case, postfabrication treatment was not required.\nSmall agglomerates of BiNPs were compressed at optimal temperature and pressure parameters to yield BiNSs. XRD peaks were indexed with the hexagonal crystal structure of Bi (Fig. 5b). The cell parameters were in good agreement with the standard literature values from JCPDS Card no. 05-0519 (Fig. 5c). Also, there was no peak ascribed to the oxidation phase of Bi. The intensities of the (003) and (006) peaks in the BiNSs samples were enhanced compared with the XRD patterns of the raw metal BiNPs. Metals and semimetals are highly crystalline materials that endure abundant plastic deformations and induce microstructure changes. During deformation, the orientation of single crystals changes related to the direction of applied stress. The pronounced reections of the (003) and (006) diffraction peaks are indicative to stress-induced recrystallization of BiNSs along a preferred (001) family of planes. The (012) plane is the dominant crystal phase, carrying bulk features into the nanosheets. XRD implied that the BiNSs were well textured and highly oriented mainly along the (012) phase, consistent with the HRTEM results (Fig. 5f and g) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED, Fig. 5e). The BiNSs were ultrathin and semi-transparent, with a freestanding nature and a thickness of 2.55 nm, showing few atomic layers of Bi. EDS veried the fabrication of pure BiNSs on the Si substrate (Fig. 5h). Fig. 5d illustrates the sheet-like nanostructure of metallic phase Bi. The SAED patterns imply high crystallinity. Fig. 5i shows the HRTEM image of the overlapped D1 area of BiNSs, with the (110) crystal orientation with a fringe spacing of 0.22 nm.\nThe facile fabrication of 2D functional nanomaterials (semimetals, metalloids, polymers and metal oxides) is restricted because of their intrinsic non-layered lattice structures. The methods for the production of 2D structural layered materials mainly include molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth and wet chemical strategies. However, the productivity of MBE growth is hindered by the low accessibility, harsh conditions, special substrate requirements and alteration in intrinsic properties of materials because of interface bonding with the substrate.152 Wet chemical methods involve complex steps and produce nanosheets in small areas.

Thus, exploration of an alternative strategies to gain high-quality and large-area ultrathin nanostructures with clean surfaces out of layered materials is desirable and helps to further studies on fundamental properties and promising applications. Bi is one of versatile layered semimetals with odd electronic properties due to its extraordinary characteristics. Various ultrathin morphologies of Bi (nanobelts, nanoribbons, thin lms and nanosheets) were prepared via the MBE growth and wet chemical methods (Table 1), which show special limitations. Thus, the development of alternative strategies to form ultrathin and large-area BiNSs from high-quality metallic Bi on arbitrary Si substrates is benecial for understanding their fundamental properties. The hot-pressing method is a facile and cost-effective mechanical way to produce ultrathin and large-area nanosheets from highly crystalline metallic Bi. Using large thermos-compression, ultrathin BiNSs were prepared from pristine BiNPs on polished Si substrates.72\n2.1.6. Other top-down methods. Metallic Sb with gray allotrope is considered barely layered based on the viewpoint of 2D layered systems. Actually, Sb is a graphite-like layered material. Sb layers consist of fused, ruffled and six-membered rings.153,154 The nearest and next-nearest Sb atoms can form an irregular octahedral complex, containing three atoms in each double layer slightly closer than three atoms in the next. This close packing forms a high density of 6.7 g cm 3 for gray Sb.154 The weak bonding action between layers has the potential for the top-down production of Sb nanosheets. Similar to graphene, metallic Sb nanosheets have potential as new anode materials with high performance in sodium storage.\nGu et al. proposed a facile strategy for the preparation of freestanding metallic Sb nanosheets through LPE of bulk gray Sb powder in isopropyl alcohol and NaOH solution.71 The metallic Sb nanosheets possessed ultrathin ( 4 nm), foldable features and large aspect ratios. These unique features of Sb nanosheets cause them to behave like graphene, which can be used construct uniform and compacted lms with other nanosheets. The unique ultrathin and large-aspect ratios of Sb nanosheets can serve as building blocks to fabricate uniform and compacted lms with graphene. In hybrid lms composed of metallic Sb nanosheets and graphene with tunable densities, the notorious volume change of metallic Sb is alleviated with the aid of exible graphene. The density of the entire electrode lm is improved by harnessing the high density of Sb nanosheets. The optimized metallic Sb nanosheets–graphene lms exhibit a high volumetric capacity, high-rate capability and superior cycle performance for sodium storage. Wu et al. reported the top-down preparation of inter-connected 2D carbon/ Sb hybrids.103 The interconnected 2D carbon nanosheets with ultrasmall Sb nanodots were embedded homogenously. K3Sb3P2O14 with a lamellar structure was mixed with HCl solution, followed by stirring for 48 h for ion exchange. Aer a repeated exchange process, pure H3Sb3P2O14 crystals were obtained, which were dispersed in water via ultrasonication and stirring. Aer the addition of glucose, the mixture solution was transferred to a Teon-lined autoclave. Aer reaction at 180 C for 10 h, solid products were obtained by ltration and freezing\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\ndry. The products were annealed at 500 C for 1–2 h in Ar/H2 to achieve Sb-NDs 3 CNs. This synthetic process is facile, convenient and suitable for the preparation of other relevant materials. The combination of multi-dimensional and multi-scale nanostructures in electrode materials induces high electron/ion transport kinetics and pronounced integrity of electrode structures upon cycling, which thus provides an efficient pathway to develop advanced electrode materials."

Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on solid substrates is used to form 2D layered pnictogen nanomaterials.75,80,90,91 Antimonene and Bi thin lms can be prepared through MBE as a facile bottom-up method.155–159 Wu et al. explored monolayer (ML) antimonene growth on a 2D layered PdTe2 substrate by MBE (Fig. 6a).91 The substrates for MBE growth of few-layer or ML 2D materials were specically selected. PdTe2 as the substrate for the MBE growth of ML antimonene is due to its crystal periodicity (4.10 Å surface lattice constant), which has a small mismatch (<2.3%) with freestanding antimonene (4.01 Å of the calculated lattice constant). The PdTe2 substrate possesses a chemically stable surface. Sb atoms were fabricated on a PdTe2 surface at 400 K. The distinct well-ordered structure was found through in situ low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). The atomic structure of ML antimonene was detected by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) (Fig. 6b and c). First-principles calculations (FPC) based on density functional theory (DFT) were employed to elucidate the experimental results. Antimonene on PdTe2 substrate was a continuous 2D ML, showing a buckled conformation (Fig. 6d–f). The antimonene layer weakly interacted with the PdTe2 substrate and was quite inert in air. High-quality epitaxial antimonene with a large bandgap and high chemical stability has potential applications in nanoelectronic devices.\nSi substrates were widely used in MBE growth.155–159 The high quality Bi ultrathin lms were grown on Si(111) by MBE. Bi lms have various microstructures, including hexagonal Bi(111) surfaces, lateral growth of semi-metal Bi lms with Bi(001)/ Si(111) interface, and single-crystalline growth of Bi lms on Si(111)-7 7. For the preparation of antimonene, bismuthene, few-layer ultrathin Sb and Bi lms, different solid substrates have been applied for epitaxy growth, such as Si(111),155,157–160 Ag(111),83,161 Ge(111),90 SiC(0001),99 PdTe2,91 Bi2Te3,162 Sb2Te3(111),162 Bi2Se3,163 NbSe2,73 Bi2Te2Se,164 Bi islands,86 oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG),74,116 sapphire and MoS2,80 and 2D-Sb grown under ultrahigh vacuum.90 Sb crystals with ultrahigh purity were evaporated with a Knudsen cell at 2–700 Å min 1. The substrate temperature changed from room temperature to 330 C. The Ge(111) surface was treated by cleaving with an undoped wafer, sonicating in acetone, rinsing with isopropanol and drying under an N2 ow. The substrate was introduced in an ultrahigh vacuum system, followed by annealing at 600–700 C for at least 1 h and ashing >800 C for a few seconds. This process allowed for 2D-Sb epitaxy growth on Ge(111). The single-crystal antimonene lms were grown on the MoS2 surface at a low growth temperature of 200 C by MBE.80\nJ. Mater. Chem.

The results were in well agreement with the theoretical predictions of the lower interface energies between antimonene and MoS2. The selective growth of antimonene on the MoS2 surface was veried on the pre-patterned MoS2/sapphire substrate.\nBi thin lms with a thickness of 6–50 nm were epitaxially grown on an Si(111) substrate in a Varian Gen II MBE growth chamber.75 Before loading into the vacuum system, the Si(111) substrate was briey dipped in a diluted solution of hydrouoric acid to remove the native oxide and passivate the dangling surface bonds with hydrogen. The substrate was loaded into a high vacuum chamber within 20 min to restrict its re-oxidation because it suffered from high-temperature bakes to reduce environmental contamination and remove any remnants of native oxide. Bi growth was initiated under room temperature at 0.2 Å s 1. The 2D growth parameters were optimized by in situ electron microscopy. Thin layers of antimonene were grown on Ag(111) by MBE.83,161 Ag(111) crystals were cleaned via cycles of Ar+ sputtering and annealed under high temperature in a preparation chamber. Sb was deposited on the Ag(111) surface from a homemade Knudson cell. The Ag(111) substrate was held at 375 K during deposition and immediately annealed at 550 K for 1 h.

The further deposition of Sb on the AgSb2 surface alloy yielded an epitaxial Sb layer, which was identied as antimonene with buckled honeycomb structures. Lei et al. prepared bilayer Sb(111) ultrathin lms on 3D topological insulator (TI) Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 surfaces via MBE.162 For the epitaxial growth of few-layer, ML ultrathin Sb and Bi(111) lms, other TI substrates were employed, such as Bi2Te2Se,164 Bi2Se3,163 and NbSe2,73 and Sb(111) thin lms were produced on the Si(111) surface by epitaxial growth.160\nReis et al. prepared bismuthene on an SiC substrate.99 Bismuthene has a Bi honeycomb lattice on the top of the insulating silicon carbide substrate SiC(0001), which acts as a candidate for high-temperature quantum spin Hall materials. Lu et al. reported the nontrivial 2D TI phase of few-layer Bi(110) lms by atomic bucking in self-assembly ultrathin Bi(110).74 A cleaved HOPG was loaded into the STM chamber and annealed overnight at 800 K. Before lm deposition, the HOPG surface was checked using STM.74,116 High-purity Bi was evaporated by a Ta boat and was deposited on the HOPG substrate at 270 K. Bi nanoislands were grown on an MoS2 substrate as the basis for antimonene growth.86 The samples were in situ prepared under ultrahigh vacuum. Nanostructures were grown by rst thermally evaporating Bi onto MoS2 substrates, followed by evaporating Sb.

Different from unstable BP, 2D group-VA materials (arsenene, antimonene, and bismuthene) were predicted to exhibit high stability and superior physical properties. The synthesis of high-quality ML or fewlayer pnictogen nanomaterials has been researched greatly, involving top-down and bottom-up methods. Currently, facile and efficient methods for the preparation of high-quality ML and few-layered 2D pnictogen nanomaterials are still required. Ji et al. designed the growth of 2D antimonene single crystals via van der Waals epitaxy.93 They reported the van der Waals epitaxy of few-layer antimonenemonocrystalline polygons, their atomic microstructure and stability in ambient conditions. The highquality few-layer antimonene monocrystalline polygons were prepared on various (or exible) substrates based on van der Waals epitaxy growth. Antimonene polygons have a buckled rhombohedral atom structure, consistent with the most stable b-phase allotrope, as predicted theoretically. First-principles and molecular dynamic simulation results prove that compared to phosphorene, antimonene is less likely to be oxidized and has higher thermodynamic stability in an O2 atmosphere at room temperature. Antimonene polygons have high electrical conductivity and optical transparency in the visible-light range, indicating their applications in transparent conductive electrodes.\nThe uorophlogopite mica substrate of KMg3(AlSi3O10)F2 with an exposed (001) surface was used for van der Waals epitaxy of few-layer antimonene polygons.93 A two-zone tube furnace with separate temperature controls was used.

The substrate was placed in the downstream area with a temperature of T2 (380 C), and maintained for 1 h. The furnace was cooled to room temperature (Fig. 7a). Mica substrate is suitable for van der Waals epitaxy due to the absence of dangling bonds on its ultra-smooth surface.165–168 The migration energy barrier of Sb atoms on the mica substrate was small, inducing a high migration rate along the mica substrate and fast lateral growth of 2D antimonene polygons (Fig. 7b). The absence of dangling bonds on the substrate surface is critical for the successful growth of antimonene layers. The characteristics of nonvalent Sb were veried by XPS,96 which indicated the absence of chemical bonding between the antimonene layers and mica, consistent with the universal characteristics of van der Waals epitaxy.165 Few-layer antimonene sheets prepared on the substrate exhibited several types of polygonal shapes, such as triangles, hexagons, rhombus and trapezoids (Fig. 7c–f). The well-dened polygons presented high crystallinity. Most of the polygons showed a lateral size of 5–10 mm. The antimonene polygons had a thickness as low as 4 nm (10 atomic layers). A very tiny sheet with a lateral size of 100 nm and a thickness of down to 1 nm were found (Fig. 7g and h), implying ML antimonene characteristics. The crystal growth of layered antimonene on mica was divided into nucleation and lateral growth at different durations (Fig. 7b). In the initial stage, the hot Sb vapor (carried by Ar/H2 gas) was cooled and deposited on themica substrate to form the nuclei. Due to the low migration barrier energy, the adatoms on the mica migrated fast to the edge of the initial nuclei, which grew along the chemically passivated surface into layers. Both\naals epitaxy.

During the growth period, crystal growth was nished in the rst 10 min.\n2.2.3. Chemical vapor deposition. Great challenges still exist in the preparation of scalable 2D structures via a controlled manner. Ultrathin nanoplates (NPs) are preferable for studying the conduction dominated by surface states due to their large surface-to-volume ratios. MBE remains the most effective method for precise layer control, but it is difficult and expensive. Yang et al. explored a vapor–solid method to prepare 2D Sb2Te3 NPs on the SiO2 surface with controllable thickness.169 The growth of high-density single quintuple-layer (QL) Sb2Te3 NPs occurred via the vapor–solid process. This process was extended to other 2D structures in the binary sesquichalcogenide family. High-purity bulk Sb2Te3 pieces were ground into powders and put in a quartz boat located in the center of a furnace (Fig. 8a and b). The SiO2/Si substrate was placed 12 cm downstream from the furnace center. A furnace tube was sealed and pumped down to 15 mTorr and ushed with ultra-pure argon several times before growth to remove oxygen. The furnace was moved to the le and was heated to over 500 C in 10 min, followed by another 10 min heating. Then, 50–100 sccm argon gas was introduced in the tube. The furnace was moved to the right to position the source quartz boat in the furnace center. Evaporation and growth were initiated. The growth was controlled to within 5 min due to the relative fast deposition of Sb2Te3 on the substrate. Then, the furnace was moved away from the source quartz boat and SiO2/Si substrate to initiate quick cooling to room temperature in 30 min.\nIn the case of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the deposition rate is inversely proportional to temperature. To optimize\nFig. 8 (a) Scheme of the furnace used for the vapor–solid synthesis of S growth of Sb2Te3 NPs, including source flow and growth region therma single-QL Sb2Te3 NP and (f) Sb2Te3 NP underneath a single-QL region.

Sharp edges and 120 facets were observed, indicating layerstructural rhombohedral lattice crystals of Sb2Te3.170 AFM was used to measure the ML thickness of the Sb2Te3 NPs. The line proling results implied step heights of 0.921 and 1.063 nm (Fig. 8c–f). Unlike ML graphene containing one atom thickness, a single ve-atom thick QL of Sb2Te3 was 1 nm in Z-thickness. The Ultrathin Sb2Te3 NPs were veried to be a single QL, which meant a preferential epitaxy process for Sb2Te3. This vapor– solid growth for preparing 2D TI nanostructures opens new opportunities in surface-state studies and applications in lowdissipative electronic systems. 2D layered structures of Bi chalcogenide materials were explored by the CVD method.108 Bi2Te3 nanoplates were prepared via vapor-phase growth.108 High-purity Bi2Te3 powder was heated to 500 C in a tube furnace and transformed into vapor phase. Ar gas ow was applied to the vacuum tube furnace, which carried the Bi2Te3 vapor to the end of the furnace, where a substrate was placed. When the temperature at the end of the furnace is lower than the center part, the molecules in the vapor start to deposit on the substrate and form ultrathin triangular or hexagonal nanoplates.\nOrdered and quasi-ordered (Bi, Ag)/Si(111) metastable structures were fabricated by depositing Ag and Bi at a high annealing temperature of 470–500 C.171 Several (Bi, Ag) oneatomic-layer structures on the Si(111) surface were observed by STM. A 2D spin-split metallic layer on a semiconductor surface has some prospects for spintronic applications. The codeposition of Bi and In onto the Si(111)7 7 surface with annealing at 250–550 C induced the formation of ordered (Bi, In)/Si(111) stable structures.172 The Bi–In 2D compound on\nb2Te3 NPs.

Then nanosheets with the Bi2Te2.9Se0.1 nominal stoichiometry were deposited by catalyst-free physical vapor deposition. Denisov et al. prepared a (Bi–In–Na) 2D compound on the Si(111) surface.174 Experiments were conducted using an Omicron STM and LEED operated under ultrahigh vacuum. Aer the samples were rst outgassed at 600 C for several hours, the atomically clean Si(111)7 7 surface was in situ prepared by ashing to 1280 C. Bi was deposited from a commercial cell. The deposition rate of Bi was calibrated by using the Si(111)b-O3 O3-Bi surface (1 ML Bi) as a reference for roomtemperature Bi deposition onto Si(111)7 7, followed by annealing at 500 C. In-deposition was carried out from a tantalum tube. The deposition rate was calibrated by the formation of an Si(111)4 1-In surface containing 1ML of In. Na-deposition was conducted using a commercial chromate dispenser. The deposition rate was calibrated using the Si(111)O3 O3-(Bi, Na) (1/3 ML Na) structure as the reference for the room-temperature deposition of Na onto the Si(111)b-O3 O3-Bi surface.\n2.2.4. Hydrothermal synthesis.

The architecture consisted of 2D corrugated [Sb2O2(OH)]\n+ layers with linear a,u-alkane disulfonate anions residing in the inter-lamellar space. 2D antimony sulde was prepared under hydrothermal conditions.105 The [C8–N4H26]0.5[Sb7S11] structure consisted of innite chains of formula Sb7S11\n2 linked via Sb–Sb bonds into 2D slabs with a thickness of 2.6 Å. In the presence of N,N-bis(3aminopropyl)ethylenediamine, amine and water were mixed with Sb2S3 under stirring to fabricate a slurry with the molar compositions of Sb2S3 : amine : water (1 : 1 : 30). The slurry was sealed in a Teon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 473 K for 3 days, followed by cooling slowly at 1 K min 1. The solid products were collected from ltration, washing and drying treatments.\nPradhan et al. demonstrated a two-step method to construct large disks of 2D Bi2Se3 in the presence of ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and Cl . EDTA served as a complex agent of Bi(III).177 Depending on the growth conditions, the 2D Bi2Se3 crystals had a at or spiral surface. As for the seedmediated growth (Fig. 9a), nucleation seeds were prepared on the right batch. Aer the formation of seeds, the precursor solution in the le batch was kept at a low temperature to restrict early reaction and was slowly injected into the right batch. Consequently, the seeds on right batch grew laterally, and their lateral diameter reached 20–50 mm. The three prominent Raman peaks located at 72, 131 and 174 cm 1 match with the reported A1g, E 2 g and A 2 1g vibrational modes of Bi2Se3, respectively (Fig. 9b).

The XRD peaks match with rhombohedral Bi2Se3 crystals (JCPDS no. 33-0214) (Fig. 9c). The pattern has a strong intensity of {003} family peaks, assigned to a prominent planar crystal facet of {001} planes. In the TEM images (Fig. 9d and e), the crystal structure has hexagonal lattice fringes with a correct lattice spacing of 2.1 Å between the {110} planes.

KI solution was added dropwise, and the pH was adjusted to 5.0, generating a uniform light-yellow suspension. Aer agitation, the mixture was transferred to a Teon-lined stainless steel autoclave that was heated for 6 h at 120 C and then cooled to room temperature. A light-yellow solid powder\nFig. 10 (a) XRD patterns of a-Sb2S3 NSs and c-Sb2S3 produced by annea images and the corresponding electron diffraction patterns taken on a-S Elsevier.\n25730 | J. Mater.

The product was dried for further use. 2D bismuth oxybromide (BiOBr) was prepared and coupled with MoS2 based on a hydrothermal process.178 To fabricate MoS2/ BiOBr, MoS2 was added to a KBr solution under sonication. Bi(NO3)3$5H2O was added to the mixture under stirring for 1 h. The mixtures were transferred to a Teon-lined autoclave and were heated at 160 C for 12 h. The precipitates were collected, followed by washing with water and ethanol. Hybridization of MoS2 with 2D-BiOBr resulted in high photocatalytic activity for the photo-degradation of Reactive Black 5, despite the use of a low-powered energy saving light bulb as the light source.

Solvothermal synthesis. Wang et al. explored the synthesis of 2D amorphous Sb2S3 nanosheets (NSs) via a colloidal chemistry approach. Organic long-chain primary amines and oleylamine were mixed with n-dodecylamine or noctylamine, which acted as so templates to assist the 2D formation of amorphous NSs.100 Oleylamine was mixed with ndodecylamine or n-octylamine, serving as colloidal reaction solution. No sharp XRD peaks were detected due to the lack of long-range order and amorphous (non-crystalline) characteristics of Sb2S3 crystals (Fig. 10a). Broadened peaks indicated the formation of amorphous a-Sb2S3. Aer thermal annealing, aSb2S3 was transformed into crystalline c-Sb2S3. The SEM and TEM images (Fig. 10b–e) showed a-Sb2S3 with a 2D sheet-like morphology. EDS analysis of the a-Sb2S3 NSs revealed an Sb/S composition close to the theoretical stoichiometry of 2 : 3. The electron diffraction and HRTEM results are shown in Fig. 10f. Only a diffraction halo was observed, and no lattice fringe was detectable, verifying the non-crystalline feature of aSb2S3 NSs. In the solvothermal colloidal synthesis, organic amines acted as the so template to dene 2D growth via the coordination of metal cations with amine groups. NSs had distinct 2D features with a thickness of 2–4 nm and dimensions (length width) ranging from several hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers.\nThe solvothermal synthesis of Bi2Se3 nanoplates was explored.108 Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) with high purity was dissolved in ethylene glycol. Bi2O3 powder, selenium powder and EDTA were added to the solution under stirring to form a suspension. The suspension was sealed in a steel autoclave, and heated at 180– 220 C for 24 h. The lateral dimension of the single-crystalline products reached a few tens of micrometers, with a thickness ranging from several to a few tens of nanometers. Bi nanoribbons were prepared from solvothermal synthesis. NaBiO3$2H2O was dissolved in glycerol under stirring and transferred to a Teonlined stainless steel autoclave.109 Aer treatment with a pure N2 gas ow, the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 200 C for 24 h. Aerwards, the black solid product was collected by ltration, followed by washing with ethanol to remove impurities. 2D organic–inorganic bismuth halides (OIBHs) were prepared from a one-pot solvothermal reaction.107 (TMP)1.5[Bi2I7Cl2] (TMP: N,N,N0,N0-tetramethylpiperazine) had mixed halogens and a unique 2D inorganic anion structure.\n2.2.6. High-temperature melting. Wu et al. synthesized a K3BiAs6Se12 single crystal of 2D bismuth selenoarsenate containing crown-shaped anions of [As3Se6]\n3 .179 K3BiAs6Se12 was prepared using the reaction mixture of K2Se3, Bi, As2Se3 and Se powder in a 1 : 1 : 1.5 : 2 molar ratio, which were mixed in an N2-lled glove box and loaded in a glass ampoule. Aer evacuation to 10 3 mbar, the ampoule was ame sealed and placed in a computer-controlled furnace. The mixture was heated to 540 C at 0.5 C min 1, and le for 5 days. The product was cooled to 100 C at 3 C h 1. The product was washed with dry N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) and diethyl ether to form black platelets (40% yield based on Bi). The single crystals were stable\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nin DMF, pure ethanol and dry air for two months. Chung et al. reported 2D super-conductivity in a single crystalline nanohybrid of organic-bismuth cuprate.112 Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy (Bi2212) super-conductor was obtained by self-ux treatment with Birich melts. This nely ground mixture of metal oxide and metal carbonate precursors, with the Bi/Sr/Ca/Cu nominal composition of 2.4 : 2 : 1 : 2 was heated to 1020 C and slowly cooled to 800 C. Excess Bi2O3 was used as a ux for crystal growth.\nLiu et al. prepared Bi4Ti3O12 (BTO) nanosheets through molten salt synthesis (Fig. 11a).180,181 Bi2O3 (TiO2) was used as a Bi (Ti) source. NaCl and KCl were used to provide a high reactive medium. The same molar ratios of Bi2O3 and TiO2 were mixed with NaCl and KCl. Aer grinding for 1 h in a mortar, the mixture was put into a corundum crucible with a lid, which was heated at 800 C for 2 h in a muffle furnace at a ramp rate of 5 C min 1. The products were centrifuged and washed with water and ethyl alcohol to remove residual inorganic salts, followed by drying at 60 C to obtain BTO nanosheets. Bismuth oxychloride (BOC) showed a layered crystal structure with [Bi2O2]\n2+ layers interleaved with two slabs of Cl with BTO (Fig. 11b and c). BTO and BOC grew together to form a composite through a convenient chemical transformation process.182 An in situ chemical transformation was used to form BTO/BOC composites using BTO nanosheets as the substrate and HCl as the chlorine source. The BTO nanosheets were dissolved in HCl solution under stirring to generate a homogeneous suspension. The suspension was stirred for 12 h at room temperature. The products were collected by centrifugation, followed by washing and drying at 60 C in an oven. HCl was used to control the weight ratios of BTO and BOC in the composites.\nXPS spectra were used to describe the surface compositions and chemical states between BTO and BOC (Fig. 11d). The XPS survey spectra evidenced the presence of Bi, Ti and O elements in BOC and BTO/BOC. A new peak of Cl 2p was detected in the BTO/BOC composites. No redundant peak appeared. The Bi 4f peaks were assigned to the characteristic peaks of Bi3+. The binding energies of Bi, Ti and O in the BTO/BOC-3 composites had positive shis compared to the bare BTO, which proved strong interactions at the contact interface between BTO and BOC. In the TEM images (Fig. 11e and f), the BOC NPs with a size of 5–10 nm were well-dispersed on the 2D BTO nanosheet surface without apparent agglomeration. The lattice fringe with an interplanar lattice spacing of 2.72 Å was assigned to the (200) crystal plane of BTO. The lattice fringe of 2.57 Å originated from the (111) crystal plane of BOC (Fig. 11g). EDS peaks for Bi, Ti, O and Cl elements were found in the composites, consistent with the XPS results (Fig. 11h). These results indicated that the BTO/ BOC 2D/0D composites were achieved aer molten salt process and chemical transformation."

Bulk Sb has the same rhombohedral structure as gray As. Among the allotropes, gray Sb is the most stable. Gray Sb and As have typical semimetal characteristics in layered bulk forms. Gray Sb is a layered material. Black Sb is produced upon rapid cooling of Sb vapor, showing an identical structure to red phosphorus. Black Sb has high chemical activity in atmospheric environment. Under vacuum, black Sb can transform easily into stable crystalline gray Sb at 373 K. Explosive Sb oen transforms ercely into gray Sb under mechanical stress or heating. Explosive Sb is probably not an allotrope, but is amixed form. Bulk bismuth (Bi) has only one stable format. Bulk Bi has a natural layered structure, which is a rhombohedral A7-type structure similar to gray As and Sb. In addition, layered Bi has a feature of metallicity.\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nFig. 12 illustrates the stable phases and natural layered crystals. Two stable phases were isolated for P and As, namely the a and b phases. There is only one stable phase for Sb and Bi, namely the b phase. The natural layered crystals of As, Sb and Bi possess the b phase. Derived from bulk phosphorus, As, Sb and Bi, few-layer or ML 2D group-VA nanomaterials are termed phosphorene, arsenene, antimonene and bismuthene. In the case of layered As, Sb, and Bi crystals, arsenene has puckered and buckled ML structures, while antimonene and bismuthene are likely to exhibit buckled forms. The ML structure of 2D group-VA materials is the most stable. Zhang et al. predicted group-VA monolayers with ve typical honeycombs and four non-honeycomb structures (Fig. 12a).118 The average binding energies for all possible group-VA ML congurations are shown in Fig. 12b. Based on the calculations, a-phosphorene with a puckered form is the most stable. In the case of arsenene, antimonene and bismuthene ML allotropes, all their b phases with buckled forms have the lowest energies. The three phases of bismuthene (a, b, and z) have very close average binding energies. The counterpart bulk material of a-phosphorene ML is BP, which is the most stable form for allotropic bulk crystals under standard conditions. Their counterpart bulk materials (barsenene, b-antimonene and b-bismuthene) are b phases (rhombohedral layered As, gray Sb and Bi). Only a and b layered phases were experimentally proved in group-VA bulk crystals. The phonon spectra of free-standing group-VA monolayers with puckered and buckled forms were studied by FPC, acting as a criterion to judge structure stability (Fig. 12c). No obvious imaginary phonon mode was found, demonstrating the kinetic stability of the free-standing group-VA monolayers. Currently, a-/b-phosphorene, b-arsenene, b-antimonene and a-/b-bismuthene have been synthesized and characterized experimentally.\nFPC was used to study the band structures and electronic properties of 2D group-VA materials.183 Especially, the electronic bandgap is an important feature of emerging 2D materials, which guides electronic and optoelectronic applications. Band gaps at different levels of group-VA monolayers for a and b phases can be calculated by theoretical predictions, such as the Perdew–Burke– Ernzerhof (PBE), Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid function, Green's function and screened Coulomb interaction (GW) methods. HSE and GW are reliable in the determination of bandgaps. PBE offers a correct physical picture, consistent with the results from the hybrid density functional theory (DFT) and GW methods. BP belongs to a typical direct-band-gap semiconductor. When BP is thinned to few-layer and ML, it retains a direct band gap.184 The band gap of phosphorene sensitively depends on the layer number (Fig. 13a and b). The fundamental band gaps of semiconductors are dominated by electron–electron interactions. The optical gap of semiconductors can be predicted using the GW method with the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) based on considerable excitonic effects. Group-VA elemental atoms are heavier than the carbon atom. Spin-orbital coupling (SOC) calculations of phosphorene, arsenene, antimonene and bismuthene can be used to evaluate their potential effects on electronic band structures. Zhang et al. predicted an abrupt transition from semimetallic (or metallic) As and Sb bulk crystals to wide-band-gap semiconductor arsenene and antimonene MLs.154\nJ. Mater. Chem.

As predicted, the b phase with a buckled form is the most stable structure among the arsenene, antimonene and bismuthene allotropes.118 Based on FPC, the b phases of arsenene and antimonene monolayers possess 1.76 and 1.65 eV indirect band-gaps at the PBE level. Using the GW method, the calculated results revealed more reliable fundamental bandgaps of arsenene and antimonene, which were predicted to be 2.47 and 2.38 eV, respectively (Fig. 13c).185 The difference between their electronic and optical bandgaps (exciton binding energies) was found to be 0.9 eV for arsenene and 0.8 eV for antimonene. In addition, b-antimonene has a strong SOC effect. The band gap of b-antimonene with SOC is 1.04 eV at the PBE level (1.55 eV at HSE level) in the presence of indirect bandgaps. For the calculated imaginary part of dielectric functions of arsenene and antimonene MLs, optical absorption occurred at 1.6 eV for arsenene and at 1.5 eV for antimonene (Fig. 13d).185\nLayered b-Bi crystals are characterized by small density of states around the Fermi level and had semi-metallic properties.

HSE correction applied to PBE states can increase the direct bandgap to 0.80 eV. When the SOC was included, the fundamental bandgap reduced to 0.32 eV. The band structure transformed from direct bandgap into indirect bandgap.186 Besides the b phase, the a phases of arsenene, antimonene and bismuthene have high thermodynamic stability, regardless of their metastable phases. Aer PBE (HSE) calculations, their band gaps were determined to be 0.77, 0.37 and 0.16 eV (1.66, 1.18 and 0.99 eV), respectively.118 Besides, a-bismuthene had a direct bandgap and transformed into an indirect bandgap semiconductor with the inclusion of SOC, similar to b-bismuthene.186,187 By contrast, the a phases of arsenene, antimonene or bismuthene had smaller bandgaps than the b phases with the most stable states.39,188–199"

The hole mobility along the armchair direction was 640–700 cm2 V 1 s 1 and that along the zig-zag direction reached up to 104 cm2 V 1 s 1. The hole mobility of BP was higher than that of MoS2 (200 cm 2 V 1 s 1),200 beneting from the extremely small deformation potential (0.15 eV). The carrier mobility of BP has strong anisotropic characteristics due to its high anisotropic atomic structures, which result in big differences in effective mass, elastic modulus and deformation potential constant along the armchair and zig-zag directions (Fig. 14a). The high in-plane transport anisotropy of BP distinguishes it from other typical 2D materials, including graphene, silicone and hexagonal boron nitride.

The blue phase is isotropic in thermal expansion. The thermal conductivity in BP was found to be anisotropic due to its orientation-dependent group velocities and phonon relaxation times.214 In terms of theoretical calculations, the thermal conductivities at 300 K were 83.5 and 24.3 W m 1 K 1 along the zig-zag and armchair directions, respectively. Notably, the electronic conductivity along the armchair direction is much larger than that along the zig-zag direction.225 The thermoelectric gure of merit (ZT) depends on both thermal conductivity and electronic conductivity. This feature is highly anisotropic for BP because its ZT value along the armchair direction is larger than that along the zig-zag direction (Fig. 14c). The intrinsic ZT value in phosphorene is rather low, but it increases by means of different improved methods.\nZeraati et al. evaluated the phonon dispersion and lattice thermal conductivity of a-arsenene through rst-principles calculations for anharmonic lattice dynamics and the Boltzmann transport equation for phonons.208 Arsenene has a smaller and more anisotropic thermal conductivity than phosphorene. The room-temperature thermal conductivities of arsenene along zig-zag and armchair directions are 30.4 and 7.8 W m 1 K 1, respectively. Due to the puckered structures of arsenene, its thermal conductivity is mainly provided by longitudinal acoustic phonon modes at a temperature over 100 K. Generally, the buckled structures of group-VA materials suggest the isotropic characteristics of their thermal properties. Antimonene was predicted to hold a low lattice thermal conductivity of 15.1 W m 1 K 1 at 300 K,215 implying a small group velocity, low Debye temperature and large buckling height. By minimizing the sample size and chemical functionalization, thermal conductivity was properly tuned to be smaller.215,216 Nevertheless, the intrinsic thermoelectric gures of merit for antimonene and bismuthene are not high enough, limiting their potential applications. Besides, their intrinsic ZT values can be effectively increased by n- or p-doping.209,217\n25736 | J. Mater. Chem. A, 2019, 7, 25712–25771"

Through FPC, the optical adsorption spectra of BP were predicted.184,226 The calculated absorption spectra are anisotropic. Light is linearly polarized in the armchair and zig-zag directions. At the bandgap, the band edge of the rst absorption peak was found to slightly decrease with an increase in layer thickness in the armchair direction. The optical adsorption peak was detected at 3.14 eV in the ML, which quickly decreased with an increase in thickness in the zig-zag direction. The optical detection of the crystalline orientation and optical activation of anisotropic transport properties were performed by in-plane linear dichroism. As calculated, phosphorene ML absorbed light between 1.1 and 2.8 eV along the armchair direction.226 In the same energy range along the zig-zag direction, phosphorene ML is transparent to light, covering the infrared and partial visiblelight regime. By tuning the number of stacking layers, the polarization energy window was tuned in a wide range, showing potential to fabricate smart optical devices. The optical conductivity tensor of BP was studied using the Kubo formula within a low-energy Hamiltonian.227 This method was used to express physical quantities observed in optical experiments. In terms of the calculated results, the optical conductivity of BP was similar to the optical adsorption spectrum and was sensitive to layer number (Fig. 14d).\nThe optical properties of arsenene, antimonene and bismuthene were studied by calculating their dielectric functions, electron energy loss spectra, absorption coefficients, refractive indices and optical reectivity in a broad energy range.56,79,87,89,92,98,108,228–242 As conrmed, the optical properties of antimonene are suitable for its use in ultraviolet optical nanodevices, micro-electronic devices and solar cells.228 Based on the calculation results, the dielectric functions were negative, namely 5.1–9.0 eV (6.9–8.4 eV) for aantimonene (b-antimonene). The results illustrated its metallic characters in the UV part of electro-magnetic spectra. The electron energy loss spectra indicated the plasmon energy of 9 eV, revealing its metallic behavior based on light refection. The refractive indices were close to 2.3 for a-antimonene and 1.5 for bantimonene at zero energy limit and scaled up to 3.6 in the ultraviolet region. When the magnitude and nature of bandgaps are required to be correctly reproduced, DFT band structure calculations only give supercial information on the optical properties of materials. Before the optical applications of 2D group-VA materials, theoretical predictions are required and oen arise from calculations of dielectric functions based on random phase approximation. Currently, the complex dielectric functions, concomitant refractive indexes, absorption coefficients, electron loss spectra and optical reectivity were reported in the energy range of 0–21 eV.228 The absorption process is expected to start in the infrared part of the spectrum and reach the maximum in the UV region. In the case of b-Sb, when the polarization direction of incident light is out-of-plane, the reectivity in the visible region is high, but absorption is nearly negligible. Based on calculations, bSb is a polarization transparent material.230 Antimonene exhibits promising uses in opto-electronic devices, such as smart solar\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\n2 3\nO ct\nob er\n2 01\n9.

      "text" : "The magnetic properties of layered nanomaterials depend on the volume, surface and step atoms of 2D nanostructures.243 Anisotropic magnetic properties are attractive for memory device applications, where nanomaterials are used as ferromagnets. Isotropic nanostructures of magnetic metals (Fe, Co and Ni) are generally superparamagnetic at room temperature due to nanosized connement effects. An effective strategy to improve magnetic anisotropy is to formmagnetic nanocrystals with structural anisotropy. For 2D layered group-VA nanomaterials, the doping of transition metal atoms (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co) can generate magnetism in a-phosphorene.244–248 Other atoms (H, B, C, O, Si, S, Ge, and Sn) and gas molecules (NO and NO2) can produce magnetic states in arsenene.249–257 Through FPC, the adsorption of NO and NO2 on phosphorene had higher adsorption energies compared with other gas molecules (CO, CO2, NH3, and N2).258 NO and NO2 adsorption led to a magnetic moment of 1 mB. Among the adsorption of different gases on buckled arsenene ML, NOx adsorbents had the largest charge transfer, showing a greater change in conductivity.257 Only the adsorption of NOx produced a magnetic moment of 1 mB. Theoretical calculations indicated that defects affect the electronic properties of 2D layered group-VA materials and produce magnetism in nonmagnetic pristine phosphorene, arsenene and antimonene.259–264 Typical point defects in arsenene and antimonene were studied.263 Most of the defective congurations retained indirect bandgaps with reduced bandgap values, and most of the single vacancy defects possessed magnetic moments due to their dangling bonds.\nAbid et al. reported the magnetic properties of zig-zag arsenene nanoribbons (ZAsNRs).265 The edge magnetism for different magnetic congurations of ZAsNRs was investigated to remove instabilities. A transition was observed from the nonmagnetic to magnetic edge states. An intra-edge antiferromagnetic semiconducting ground state was found. To tune the edge states, strain engineering was applied on the magnetic ground states. At a critical value of compressive strain ( 6%), a transition from magnetic edge states to nonmagnetic ones occurred (Fig. 15a). The geometrical structures and chemical termination of arsenene nanoribbons had obvious effects on their magnetic properties.266 Using the DFTmethod, the normal or one-atom terminated zig-zag nanoribbon was a weak antiferromagnetic semiconductor due to the magnetic interactions between the edge states. In the case of bare ZAsNRs, tensile strain stabilized the antiferromagnetic states with enhanced magnetic moments. Liu et al. evaluated the magnetic properties of arsenene that was functionalized by 3d transition-metal (TM) atoms.267 The pristine arsenene is a nonmagnetic material, but its dilute magnetism can be produced upon chemisorption of TM atoms. Magnetism is mainly due to TM adatoms and magnetic properties can be tuned through moderate external strain.

By studying the magnetic interactions between moments induced by Al and Ga adatoms, p–d exchange-like p–p hybridization in the ferromagnetic states was found.When the distance of Ga–Ga or Al–Al increased, the ferromagnetic interactions were extremely depressed. This phenomenon was explained using the\nJ. Mater. Chem. A, 2019, 7, 25712–25771 | 25737\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\n2 3\nO ct\nob er\n2 01\n9.

Al- or Ga-adsorbed arsenene is a superior candidate for application in spintronic devices. Xu et al. explored the inuence of vacancies and nonmetallic atoms on the magnetic properties of buckled arsenene.269 Because of the formation of one nonbonding p-electron (from dopant C, Si) or a neighboring As atom (around O, Si and vacancies), a doping (C, Si, O, and S) atom and a vacancy induced a magnetic moment of 1.0 mB in buckled arsenene. The magnetic coupling between moments caused by two (C, Si, O, and S) atoms is longrange anti-ferromagnetic. Based on the calculated density of states and spin density distribution, p–p hybridization interactions involve polarized electrons and are responsible for magnetic coupling. Magnetism in buckled arsenene can be engineered via vacancies and substitutional doping of nonmetallic atoms. Kadioglu et al. revealed that point defects modied the magnetic structure of 2D ML structural Bi.270 The interactions between foreign adatoms and bismuthene structures comprised magnetic structures. Localized states in diverse locations of bandgaps and resonant states in the band continua of bismuthene were induced upon the adsorption of different adatoms, which modied its magnetic properties. Dai et al. investigated the magnetic properties of Fe-doped and defecttuned antimonene systems.271 A large magnetic moment was obtained in defect systems. Stable ferromagnetism was obtained in the Fe-doped system. Due to the presence of intrinsic vacancies, Fe-doped antimonene with anti-ferromagnetism order is not suitable for practical applications in spintronics nanodevices."

When an externally compressive strain was applied along the zig-zag direction of phosphorene, its band gap increased and then decreased with an increase in strain (Fig. 15b), suggesting that the bandgap of phosphorene is sensitive to strain.272 The bandgap reached the maximum with a critical tensile strain of 4% in the zig-zag direction. A similar bandgap change was determined under an external strain applied along the armchair direction. Under external strain, the effective mass of phosphorene causes dramatic transformation. The favorable direction of electron transport was switched with applied biaxial strain.273 Electron mobility along the zig-zag direction is much larger than that along the armchair direction, but hole mobility is not sensitive to the applied strain. An applied electric eld tuned the electronic properties of phosphorene. Under an external electric eld, the bandgap of few-layer phosphorene decreased (0.22 eV) with an increase in the electric eld.274 ML phosphorene had a slight decrease (0.08 eV). By applying an external electric eld, a specic band inversion was induced to acquire topological states.275–279 Arsenene and antimonene had an indirect-to-direct bandgap transition under small biaxial strain.154 Under 0–3% biaxial strain, the minimal conduction band of buckled arsenene was retained in the Brillouin zone halfway between the G and M high-symmetry points.

Under tensile strain of 4–12%, arsenene maintained a direct-bandgap characteristic of semiconductors (Fig. 15c).\nThe electronic properties of few-layer or ML allotropes of arsenene, antimonene and bismuthene were studied under different conditions of strain, electric eld and defects by means of theoretical calculations.186,206,230,263,266,280–290 Antimonene has electronic band characteristics similar to that of arsenene under biaxial tensile strain.281 Both arsenene and antimonene have a changing trend from an indirect to a direct bandgap semiconductor. Both of them are strained and present direct band structures. Electronic excitation becomes feasible and has lower phonon energies. The merits of arsenene and antimonene endow them promising applications in optical devices. The electronic band structures of arsenene and antimonene were modulated by strain and strain, resulting in a topological insulator transition.194,291 Theoretical studies suggested that strain drives normal insulators of arsenene and antimonene to novel topological nontrivial 2D materials (Fig. 15e).275 According to theoretical calculations, defects impact the electronic properties of 2D layered group-VA materials to yield magnetism in nonmagnetic pristine phosphorene, arsenene and antimonene.259–264 Scientists have studied the electronic band structures and bias-dependent transport properties of defective phosphorene systems. The bandgap is closed in single-vacancy phosphorene, but it reappears in the divacancy system. Vacancy defects greatly increase the current of phosphorene-based devices. Most defective congurations retain indirect bandgaps with reduced bandgap values. The defects in antimonene cause a transition from an indirect bandgap to a direct bandgap. Most single vacancy defects carry magnetic moments because of their dangling bonds. A single vacancy in antimonene endows it with metallic character. Four divacancies retained the semiconducting characters of antimonene with reduced bandgaps.263,283,292"

The fabrication of stacking van der Waals heterostructures can act as a promising strategy to tune the electronic properties of 2D layered group-VA nanomaterials.\nDifferent from the vertically stacked van der Waals heterostructures, the lateral heterostructures of 2D group-VA nanomaterials are connected in-plane by covalent bonds with atomically clean and sharp interfaces. The lateral heterostructures have potential to regulate the ultimate thickness of heterostructures for electronic and optical device applications. Arsenene and antimonene can be used as building blocks to assemble lateral heterostructures. Compared with pristine As and Sb monolayers, freestanding As/Sb lateral heterostructures with zig-zag interlines and the stitching of As/Sb monolayers inplane have high stability and intrinsic direct energy gaps without modulations.314 Lateral heterostructures (arsenene/BP) were linked by covalent bonds to fabricate a type-II band alignment, which enhanced charge carrier separation spatially.313 High charge carrier mobility oen depends on the width of the building blocks (arsenene and antimonene). 2D group-VA nanomaterials with lateral heterostructures have high electronic and optoelectronic properties, superior to other types of heterostructures. 2D group-VA pnictogen materials can form various hybrid heterostructures by combination with metals,311 semiconductors,237,298 TMDs,236,299–301 2D inorganic nanomaterials,302–305 etc. ML bismuthene underwent metallization upon contact with metal electrodes due to strong interactions.311 ML bismuthene formed an n-type (p-type) Schottky contact with Ir/Ag/Ti (Pt/Al/Au) electrodes. The tunable interfacial properties of ML bismuthene–metal contacts render them promising application as metal electrodes in ML bismuthene devices.\nArsenene (b-As) can form heterostructures with TMDs (WSe2, WS2, MoS2, and MoSe2), showing tunable electronic properties through FPC.236,299–301 Arsenene/MoS2 and arsenene/WSe2 van der Waals heterostructures underwent a transition from type-II to type-I (then from type-I to type-II) under an external electric eld. Engineered arsenene/MoS2 heterostructures consisting of two MLs MoS2 and arsenene had novel electronic and optical conductivity. Arsenene-based heterostructures paired with MoS2 and tetracyano/tetracyano naphtho quinodimethane formed type-II band alignments, which were used as catalysts for photocatalytic water splitting and photovoltaics with high power conversion efficiency ( 20%).309 Wang et al. studied the Sb/GaAs 2D/3D van der Waals heterostructure.237 This unique heterostructure without constraint of lattice matching is suitable for achieving improved electronic and optoelectronic properties. van der Waals interactions are crucial for the stability of Sb/GaAs heterointerfaces. The interfacial coupling strength and band structural characteristics of the heterostructures were affected by interface structures (Fig. 16b). The stable Sb/GaAs heterostructures had a type-II band alignment with small bandgaps of 0.71–1.39 eV compared with the\n25742 | J. Mater. Chem. A, 2019, 7, 25712–25771\nindependent Sb ML and GaAs substrates. Similar to arsenene/ GaS van der Waals heterostructures,298 the Sb/GaAs van der Waals heterostructures had carrier separation and high optical absorption coefficient in the visible-light range. Thus, the Sb/ GaAs heterostructure may be a superior candidate for application in optoelectronic devices, especially solar cells and photocatalysts for water splitting.\nThe suitable electronic structures of a-AsP enabled the generation of perfect type-II semiconductor hetero-junctions with GaN (Fig. 16c), which boosted the separation and transport of photo-generated carriers with the assistance of built-in eld and high mobility.312 a-phase few-layer As–phosphorus alloys were prepared, paving the way to realize black As–phosphorus ML donors. Arsenene/Ca(OH)2 van der Waals heterostructures showed strain-tunable electronic and photocatalytic properties (Fig. 16d).302 Electric eld modulations of band alignments in arsenene/Ca(OH)2 heterobilayers were used for multifunctional device applications.303 The electronic and optical properties of arsenene/C3N van der Waals heterostructures were regulated by an applied vertical strain and external electric eld, showing superior light-harvesting performance.234 By surface charge transfer doping of arsenene/antimonene heterostructures, atomically thin p–n/p–n nanodevices were explored.304 A type-II energy band alignment was produced in O-arsenene/Cs2CO3– antimonene heterostructures, which extended light absorption into the near-infrared region and promoted the spatial separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs."

The electronic structures and properties of 2D group-VA nanomaterials can be altered by dopingmetallic or nonmetallic agents. Compared to traditional substitutional and interstitial doping in a lattice, the deposition of a specic atomic or molecular layer on the surface of 2D group-VA nanomaterials is an efficient strategy, which tunes or optimizes the electronic and magnetic properties for specic applications (Table 2). The physicochemical properties of the doped counterparts depend on the dopant compositions and concentrations. Alkali metals exhibit small electron affinities and transfer electrons to BP as dopants. K was deposited on fewlayer BP via an in situ surface doping technique.315 Based on FPC, the bandgap of phosphorene was tuned by this type of electron doping. With an increase in K doping, the valence band was shied down and the phosphorene bandgap decreased. Few-layer BP was transformed from a semiconductor to a bandinverted semimetal by K doping. To tune the type of dominant charge carriers in BP, Cu was deposited on the surface of BP or intercalated between BP layers.316 The Cu adatoms deposited on BP by sputtering and integrated in eld effect transistors (FETs) induced a shi in threshold voltage. Aer Cu deposition, the BP channel was shied from p-type to n-type at room temperature.\nAccording to FPC, Fe-doped antimonene had tunable electronic and magnetic properties.271 In the Fe-doped system, a large magnetic moment and stable room-temperature\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\n2 3\nO ct\nob er\n2 01\n9.

The simultaneous strong orbital hybridization (p–d) and spin–orbit interaction induced signicant spin splitting around the Fermi level. There was a transformation from narrow band-gap semiconductor to semimetallic material. When two intrinsic vacancies are introduced into Fe-doped antimonene, anti-ferromagnetism order appears, which limits its use in spintronic devices. DFT was used to study the mechanical properties of pristine, Fe-, Ti- and V-doped arsenene.207 By applying uniaxial and biaxial strains on\nFig. 17 (a) Band structures of B-, C-, N-, O- and F-doped arsenene.

Under strain, the magnetic moment abruptly increased to about 2 mB. The emergence of magnetism was reected by the reduction in the interactions between Co and neighboring atoms by strain, causing the spin-splitting of the Co3d states. Upon magnetism transition, modication of the electronic properties of arsenene and antimonene occurred under strain, showing novel half-metallic behaviors. Considering the remarkable charge transfer from adatoms to arsenene, metallic states were found in Li-, Na-, Al-, Co-doped systems, where the Co-doped arsenene had a half-metal property.318\nSubstitutional doping of 3d transition metal (TM) atoms on arsenene or antimonene produced tunable structural, electronic and magnetic properties.256 According to the calculated binding energies, TM-substituted arsenene was robust. Magnetic states were found because of the doping of Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe and Ni. The Sc-/Co-doped arsenene nanosheets had nonmagnetic semiconducting properties. The substitution of As with Ti, Cr and Cu atoms led to a dilute magnetic semiconductor phase (Fig. 17).252 The magnetism of Fe-/Ni-doped arsenene was tuned by adjusting the doping concentration.255 Half-metallic states were found in Ti-, V-, Mn-, Fe- and Ni-doped arsenene and antimonene.319 Spin-polarized semiconducting states occurred with V, Cr, and Fe doping. Ti-, V-, Mn- and Fedoped arsenene nanosheets exhibited ferromagnetic coupling. Cr substitutional doping induced antiferromagnetic coupling under the most stable conguration. TM-substituted arsenene shows potential applications for spintronics and magnetic storage devices. Other types of metallic doping of arsenene involved Sn, Ga, Ge, Li and metal compounds (Cs2CO3),304 presenting tunable structural, electronic and magnetic properties.251,253,320 The high-temperature superconducting, magnetism and magneto-optical effects of hole-doped gray, ML or buckled arsenene were proven under strain conditions.240,321,322 In the case of n- or p-type doping of antimonene, tetrathiafulvalene and tetracyano-quinodimethane served as electron and hole dopants to obtain n- and p-type antimonene semiconductors, respectively, which widen the applications of 2D semiconductors in electronics and optoelectronics.239,323\nThe nonmetallic doping of 2D group-VA nanomaterials was explored. Through FPC investigations on arsenene doped with non-magnetic elements, dopants from groups III, V and VII with odd numbers of valence electrons maintained the semiconducting character of the pristine system, while that (groups IV and VI) with an odd number of valence electrons caused a change in metallic character (Fig. 17).320,324 C-/O-doped systems were spin-polarized and modulated into half-metals by external electric elds. Buckled arsenene with doping of vacancies and nonmetal atoms was thermodynamically stable at room temperature. The substitutional doping of H, F, B, N and P did not produce magnetism in buckled arsenene. Saturation or pairing of valence electrons from the dopants and neighboring As atoms occurred.269 Vacancy and doping of C, Si, O and S induced a magnetic moment of 1.0 mB in buckled arsenene, resulting from one nonbonding valence electron of C and Si or neighboring As atom around O, S and vacancy. The magnetic coupling between magnetic moments induced by two\n25744 | J. Mater. Chem.

Arsenene and antimonene had tunable electronic structures and magnetic properties through impurity doping of H, B, C, N, O, S, Si, P, F, Cl, Br, I, Sb and Se.251,253,325,326 Engineered nanostructures of arsenene and antimonene with metallic or nonmetallic doping have a broad range of applications in electronic, optoelectronic and magnetic devices."

Based on FPC, Chen et al. found that Li-intercalated bilayer arsenene with AB stacking is dynamically stable and is different from the pristine bilayer with AA stacking. Electron–phonon coupling of stable Li-intercalated bilayer arsenene was dominated by low frequency vibrational modes and produced a superconductivity of Tc (8.68 K) with isotropic Eliashberg functions.321 Metal adatoms on arsenene have binding energies larger than the cohesive energies of bulk metals, implying the formation of stable adsorbates. Due to the localized states from adatoms, adsorption systems have various electronic properties, such as metal, half-metal, semiconducting and spin-semiconducting behaviors. The adsorption of Cu, Ag and Au turned semiconducting arsenene into a narrow gap spin-semiconductor (Fig. 18a).318 Arsenene functionalized with metal adatoms acted as spintronics and dilute magnetic semiconductor materials. Yang et al. studied the interface between Co(0001) and ML or bi/tri-layer antimonene with different stacking models.327 Aer contact, a high Schottky barrier was formed. The barrier height was tuned by different Co/antimonene stacking patterns. The Co d and Sb sp orbitals had strong hybridization near EF. Strong chemical bonds formed between Co and antimonene at the interface. The results implied applications in spin diodes and spin FETs based on antimonene. Nonmagnetic metal atoms (Li, Na, Al, Ga, Mg, Ga, Ge, and In) and TM atoms (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) were absorbed onto ML, fewlayer arsenene, antimonene, free-standing As and Sb nanosheets.250,267,268,328 Magnetism was observed for nonmagnetic Al and Ga adatoms adsorbed onto arsenene ML. TM-adsorbed arsenene or antimonene systems are promising candidates for electronic and spintronic devices.\nAdsorption of nonmetal atoms onto 2D group-VA nanomaterial involved adatoms of H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, Cl, As, Se and Sb.250,329 Adatoms produce chemisorption bonds and modify atomic structures and physical properties locally. Some adatoms cause obvious local reconstruction of atomic structures. A majority of adsorbed atoms cause localized states in fundamental bandgaps. Light atom (B, C, N, O, and F) absorbed arsenene nanosheets were studied by FPC.254 Most adatoms prefer to occupy bridge sites on arsenene nanosheets except for C adatom (valley sites). Defect states were detected in the middle gap of the F-adsorbed system. N adatoms caused n-type doping. O adatoms had negligible effects on its electronic structures. B, C, N and F adatoms induced magnetism in arsenene nanosheets. For As-adsorbed ML hexagonal arsenene (hAs) (Fig. 18b),251 its Fermi level crossed the spin-up states, yielding metallic behaviour. Organic molecules can be adsorbed on 2D group-VAmaterials. Using FPC, Gao et al. proved selective organic molecular adsorption control of carrier types in arsenene.330 Tetracyano-quinodimethane (TCNQ) and tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) with electron-withdrawing and donating abilities, respectively, were selected as organic molecules. The donors were adsorbed on the surface of arsenene via a physisorption process. There was a considerable electron transfer from arsenene to TCNQ, yielding p-doped arsenene. However, the electrons transferred from TTF to arsenene are not enough to make effective n-doped arsenene. An additional tensile strain\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nassisted this process. Due to the precise control of carrier types and combination of the p-/n-doped components, p–n junctions can be formed in arsenene-based nanodevices and exhibit applications in transistors and photodetectors.239,323\nThe adsorption of gas molecules onto 2D group-VA nanomaterials refers to various small molecules, including H2, N2, CO2, CO, O2, H2O, NH3, SO2, NO and NO2.250,329,331–335 By rstprinciples spin-polarized density functional calculations, the chemisorption of selected adatoms and physisorption of molecules on two antimonene (or ML arsenene) phases with buckled honeycomb (b-Sb, b-As) and symmetric washboard (wSb, w-As) structures were studied.250,329 Molecules such as H2, O2 and H2O neither formed strong chemical bonds nor dissociated. They were physisorbed with weak binding energies without affecting the properties of antimonene (Fig. 18c). The interactions of molecules with nanomaterials are crucial for hydrogen storage, evaluation reaction and oxidation–deoxidation. Molecules weakly interact with antimonene. The binding energies are weak, showing a predominant van der Waals character. Selected metal and nonmetal adatoms formed strong bonds with antimonene by exchanging electronic charges, causing local reconstructions and defects. Electronic states from adatoms led to a diversity of electronic states, together with high carrier mobility, magnetism (spin-polarized) and halfmetal characters. Some molecules were dissociated at the edges of arsenene ake structures. Constituents were adsorbed to the edge atoms to cause local reconstructions.250\nCO adsorption on pristine antimonene is physical adsorption that is then converted to chemical adsorption aer doping.332 An external electric eld improved the CO gas sensitivity on antimonene to realize CO sensing at room temperature. Adsorption and desorption of CO can be controlled by applying an external electric eld, which is helpful to collect and store CO gas. Gas adsorption of pristine antimonene was studied by FPC, which promoted the exploration of its high-performance gas sensing.335 Atmospheric gas molecules (N2, CO2, O2, and H2O) were weakly adsorbed on antimonene. However, pollutant gas adsorbates (NH3, SO2, NO, and NO2) were physically adsorbed on antimonene, showing stronger adsorption energies and elevated charge transfer due to the contributions of the frontier orbitals of the molecules being closer to the Fermi level and more apparent orbital hybridizations. Due to the moderate physical and chemical adsorption of their atom-doped analogues, appreciable charge transfer and susceptibility of electronic properties, ML antimonene and arsenene may be potential sensing materials for the sensitive detection of pollutant gases.257,331,333,335,336"

The QAH effect is superior to the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect because it can avoid inelastic scattering of two edge electrons located on one side of topological nontrivial materials. This superiority is desirable for electronics and spintronics. Candidates of 2D topological insulators (TIs) with large bandgaps were predicted, such as arsenene functionalized with F, OH and CH3 groups (Fig. 19a).348 Ab initio molecular dynamic simulations implied the thermal stabilities of AsX monolayers at 500 K. The nontrivial topological phase was proven by the topological invariant Z2 and edge states. The topological electronic bandgaps of the AsF ML were modulated by biaxial tensile strain and vertical external electric eld. Pronounced light absorption in the near-infrared and visible range of the solar spectrum was expected for AsH or AsF monolayers, which are attractive for light harvesting. Nontrivial QSH insulators AsX are promising candidates for applications in dissipationless transport devices and photovoltaics. Robust 2D TIs in methyl-functionalized Bi and Sb bilayer lms were predicted by FPC. Me–Bi and Me–Sb had protected Dirac-type topological helical edge states, which are suitable for QSH systems.349 2D TIs with large topological energy gaps are superior platforms for topological phenomena and applications at high temperature.\nEremeev et al. reported a giant Rashba-type spin splitting in 2D electron systems that resided at the Te-terminated surface of Bi tellurohalides.350 BiTeCl semiconductor had an isotropic metallic surface-state band lying in deep inside bulk bandgaps. The giant spin splitting of this band ensured substantial spin asymmetry of inelastic mean free path of quasiparticles with different spin orientations. Amsler et al. developed quasi-2D CuBi nanosheets from ab initio calculations.351 Through predictions, single layers of CuBi were isolated from highpressure bulk CuBi materials. The nanosheets exhibited superior electronic and electrochemical properties. When used as a superconductor, there was a moderate electron–phonon coupling (l ¼ 0.5 and Tc z 1 K). The CuBi nanosheets were readily intercalated with lithium with high diffusibility and applied potential to boost the rate capacity of current electrodes in lithium-ion batteries. Li et al. studied the electronic structures of atomically thin layers of Bi2Ti3 quasi-2D crystals.352 Quintuple layers of Bi2Te3 indicated semiconductors with localized shallow bands. Weak covalent Bi–Te2 interactions in the quintuple layers allowed them to be exfoliated to bi/tri-layer nanosheets. The bi/tri-layer nanosheets of Bi2Te3 are metallic because valence electrons cannot fully occupy valence bands. Arsenene oxide transited its bandgap from an indirect band to a direct one.353 The transition is due to a new (conduction) bottom band, consisting of 4s-orbitals of partial oxidized arsenic (layered AsxOy), p-orbitals of oxygen and unoxidized arsenic. The direct bandgap width was narrowed from the nearinfra to infra region in proportion to the oxygen content. Arsenene oxide (AsO) is a good candidate 2D material with QSH effects. Through ab initio calculations, AsO had high stability, exibility and tunable SOC gaps (Fig. 19b).354 The maximum nontrivial bandgap of AsO reached 89 meV, which was enhanced to 130 meV under biaxial strain. AsO with oxidized\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nsurfaces was stable against surface oxidization and degradation, which is suitable for designing topological quantum devices.\n2D b-phase group-VA binary monolayers (PAs, PSb, PBi, AsSb, AsBi, and SbBi) were explored by means of DFT calculations.355 They were veried to be stable free-standing materials with versatile electronic structures, and had direct or indirect band gaps of 0.90–2.39 eV, as predicted at the HSE06 level with spin-orbital coupling corrections. A linear correlation was explored between the cohesive energy and band gaps of different composites with average ionization energies (AIEs), showing the potential to engineer desirable properties of these 2D materials from the AIEs of component atoms. These 2D binary compounds had extremely small effective masses of carriers and high electronmobility. They exhibited considerable absorption of solar energy and suitable band alignments for photocatalytic water splitting. The in-plane heterostructure could be gained by combining the elemental 2D group-VA monolayers (Sb/Bi, As/P, and As/Sb) or other 2D materials (graphene, WSe2, MoS2, and silicene).355 Binary 2D compounds with various compositions and structures are expected to hold exciting properties, such as semiconductor-topological insulator transition, magnetism and extraordinary sunlight absorbance.

However, despite the tremendous progress on studies of BP-based nanostructures, a key barrier for BP applications is its degradation upon longterm exposure under ambient conditions. The origin of BP degradation is due to POx species generated by reaction between oxygen and lone-pair electrons perpendicular to the BP surface. 2D group-VA pnictogen materials beyond BP such as ML and few-layer As, Sb, and Bi (arsenene, antimonene and bismuthene, respectively) are promising candidates of BP or phosphorene, and have superior physical and chemical properties. Their high charge-carrier mobility, tunable direct bandgap and unique in-plane anisotropic structure give them remarkable applications in a broad range of elds.

In SbNS–graphene, the electrons from a lower work function of graphene (4.43 eV) tend to migrate across the Sb–graphene boundary to a higher work function of SbNS (4.55–4.70 eV),104,360 which increases the electron density at the surface of SbNS. SbNS–graphene had a higher selectivity to formate at a lower overpotential compared with bulk Sb and SbNSs (Fig. 20a). At a potential of 0.96 V (over-potential of 0.87 V), SbNS–graphene delivered the maximal efficiency for its formation (88.5%). SbNS had the maximal efficiency of 84% at 1.06 V. The partial current density for formate from SbNS–graphene was larger than of bulk Sb and SbNSs (Fig. 20b). The current density of SbNS– graphene at 1.07 V was 1.5 (or 16) times higher than that of SbNSs (or bulk Sb). Aer 2D engineering of nanostructures and compositing with graphene, SbNSs were transferred from catalytically inactive materials into an active form. 2Dmosaic Bi nanosheets were utilized for selective ambient electrocatalytic N2 reduction.361 The high electrocatalytic activity of Bi nanosheets is due to sufficient exposure of its edge sites coupled with effective p-orbital electron delocalization in mosaic Bi nanosheets. Their semiconducting feature limits surface electron accessibility and effectively enhances the faradaic efficiency.\nt applied potentials on bulk Sb, SbNSs and SbNS–graphene.

Thin 2D square-shape nanosheets with exposed {001} facets were responsible for their visible-light driven photocatalytic activity. The unique nanostructure offered a suitable diffusion length and self-induced internal static electric eld direction of BiOI, improving the separation efficiency of photoinduced electron–hole pairs in the BiOI nanosheets. Thin 2D nanosheets have a greater percentage of {001} facet exposure. A stronger internal static electric eld is induced, with improved photocatalytic activity.362,363 2D BiOBr was coupled with co-catalyst MoS2 via a hydrothermal process.178 The photoactivity of the hybrid photocatalyst MoS2/BiOBr was studied under irradiation of a 15 W energy-saving light bulb under ambient conditions using Reactive Black 5 (RB5) as the model dye solution (Fig. 20d–f). Aer 3 h of irradiation, the photodegradation of RB5 by BiOBr loaded with 0.2 wt% MoS2 (MoBi-2) was 1.4- and 5.0-fold higher than that of the pristine BiOBr and TiO2. This high photocatalytic performance resulted from the effective migration of the excited electrons from BiOBr to MoS2, which could prolong the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs.\nA layered architecture consisting of 2D corrugated [Sb2O2(OH)]\n+ layers with linear a,u-alkanedisulfonate anions residing in the interlamellar space was used as a Lewis acid catalysst.101 The cationic material had chemical robustness under high acidic aqueous conditions (pH ¼ 1). Upon combination of the robust nature and high density of SbIII sites on the exposed crystal facets, this cationic layered-material was shown to be an efficient and recyclable catalyst for the cyanosilylation of benzaldehyde derivatives with trimethylsilyl cyanide. The Lewis acidity of the SbIII sites catalyzed the ketalization of carbonyl groups under green solvent-free conditions. Based on the superior electronic properties of 2D group-VA nanomaterials, they are predicted to have high photocatalytic capability. Organic–inorganic bismuth halides have tunable electronic structures with potential as the enhanced 2D lightharvesting materials.107 By pairing with MoS2 or a quinodimethane complex, arsenene-based heterostructures formed type-II band alignments, satisfying the requirements of photocatalysts for photocatalytic water splitting.309 Photocatalysis of BP/arsenene LHSs with superior electronic properties was predicted.313 By comparing band-edge positions with redox potentials, b-stacking arsenene/Ca(OH)2 van der Waals heterostructure with strain-tunable electronic and photocatalytic properties is an excellent photocatalyst for water splitting.302 Also, by comparing band-edge positions with the redox potentials of water, the arsenene/GaS van der Waals heterostructure with tunable electronic properties is a good photocatalyst for water splitting.298 Bi4Ti3O12/BiOCl 2D/0D composites exhibited improved photocatalytic capacity for the degradation of the antibiotic tetracycline hydrochloride.180 Their high photocatalytic capacity is due to the matched crystal\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nstructures, suitable energy band structures, and intimate contact interfaces among Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets, ultrane BiOCl NPs and 2D/0D composite nanostructures. Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting was conducted based on the 2D heterostructure of BP/bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) using visible light.364 Their respective band structures with staggered alignment were used for effective charge separation, allowing the reduction and oxidation of water on BP and BiVO4. Heterojunctions of 0D Bi nanodots/2D Bi3NbO7 nanosheets were used for the efficient visible light photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics.365 Semimetal Bi increased the visible light absorption of photocatalysts and promoted the molecular oxygen activation of Bi3NbO7, improving its photocatalytic performance for the degradation of ciprooxacin."

According to theoretical calculations, BP has ultrafast Li-ion diffusion and large capacity for applications in Li-ion batteries.367–370 Li atoms formed strong bonding with P atoms, staying in the cationic state.367 At a high concentration of Li atoms, the phosphorene–Li complex becomes metallic and exhibits high electrical conductivity. The diffusion of Li atoms on phosphorene with a puckered honeycomb nanosheet is extremely anisotropic. Li-diffusion along the armchair direction is almost prohibited, but its diffusion along the zig-zag direction is energetically favorable. The diffusion barrier of Li atoms along the zig-zag direction was 0.08 eV lower in energy than other Li-battery anode materials, such as graphene (0.3 eV) and MoS2 (0.28 eV).371–374 This low energy barrier led to diffusivity of 104 (102) times faster than that in graphene (MoS2). The average voltage of adsorbed Li-atoms is 2.9 V, which is suitable for phosphorene-based Li-ion batteries. Na-diffusion was anisotropic. The diffusion barrier along the zig-zag direction was predicted to be 0.04 eV.375,376 Phosphorene was studied as an anode material for Li-/Na-ion batteries.377–384 The few-layer phosphorene sandwiched between graphene layers was used as a high-capacity anode for Na-ion batteries.378 Hybrid phosphorene–graphene materials had a specic capacity of 2440 mA h g 1 at a current density of 0.05 A g 1. There was 83% capacity retention aer 100 cycles at an operating potential of 0–1.5 V. The large capacity of this anode material is due to the intercalation of Na ions along the zig-zag direction of phosphorene and the formation of Na3P alloys. Owing to their sandwiched structures, phosphorene– graphene hybrids with superior electronic properties are good anode materials for Na-ion batteries. BP-based hybrids were widely applied for energy storage, including Li-/Na-ion batteries, perovskite solar cells and supercapacitors.48,49,51,55,57,59\nAmetallic buckled SbNS–graphene lm exhibited a high rate capability, high volumetric capacity and good cycle performance for Na storage.71 At a current density of 0.1 mA cm 2, the reversible volumetric capacity in the initial cycle reached a high\nJ.

The high exibility of graphene relieved the stress of the notorious volume changes of metallic Sb. Metallic Sb nanosheets are applied in Na-ion batteries. Due to their puckered and buckled structural properties, 2D group-VA materials with low atomic packing factors are favorable for the accommodation of Li and Na atoms. The rich alloy phases of Li3X and Na3X (X: P, As, Sb, and Bi) give high capacities for Li-/Na-ion batteries. The high surface areas of 2D group-VA nanosheets endow a higher capacity and faster ion diffusion as anodes in Li-/Naion batteries. Wu et al. explored interconnected 2D carbon/Sb hybrids as advanced anodes for Na storage.103 Multidimensional and multi-scale hybrid nanostructures promoted the electron-ion transport kinetics for electrode materials, and ensured the integrity of electrode structures upon cycling.

The Na storage and sodiation/ desodiation mechanisms of 2D few-layer antimonene (FLA) were explored.85 FLA had anisotropic volume expansion along the a/b planes and reversible crystalline phase evolution (Sb ! NaSb! Na3Sb) during cycling (Fig. 21). Based on FPC, FLA had a small Na-ion diffusion barrier of 0.14 eV.

It retained a stable capacity of 620 mA g 1 at 0.5C with 99.7% capacity retention from 10 to 150 cycles.

Smooth and large 2D antimonene was produced with uniform and specic number of layers.78 In experiments, the bandgap depending on antimonene thickness was nely tuned to 0.8–1.44 eV. Antimonene acted as a hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells (Fig. 21a–e), which resulted in a signicant improvement in hole extraction and current ( 30%). This work paved the way for the widespread applications of the emerging 2D group-VA nanomaterials with superior electronic properties in optoelectronics. In addition to Na-ion batteries and perovskite solar cells, antimonene was also explored as a new 2D nanomaterial for supercapacitors.81 Antimonene served as an electrode material of supercapacitors. Antimonene improved the energy storage capabilities of carbon electrodes in cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charging. Antimonene presented a capacitance of 1578 F g 1 and a high charging current density of 14 A g 1. Antimonene is an excellent material for energy storage, and due to its competitive energy and power densities of 20 mW h kg 1 and 4.8 kW kg 1, antimonene-based systems have excellent charge storing and cycling capabilities.\nAccording to theoretical predictions, 2D layered group-VA pnictogen materials and pnictogen-containing 2D hybrids have applications in photovoltaics. Arsenene-based heterostructures paired with MoS2 or quinodimethane complex can form type-II band alignments and have a high power conversion efficiency of 20% for photovoltaic solar cells.309 Sb/GaAs van der Waals heterostructures led to the separation of carriers and a high optical absorption coefficient in the visible-light range, implying these heterostructures are candidates for application in optoelectronic devices (solar cells).237 Black arsenic–phosphorus (aAsP) ML has a direct bandgap (1.54 eV) and a mobility of over 1.4 104 cm2 V 1 s 1, indicating that ML a-AsP is a superior donor for application in 2D solar cells. ML a-AsP may be the next material with broad applications in photovoltaic devices.312 An arsenene/C3N van der Waals heterostructure, with a broad absorption range, remarkable visible light absorption and high light harvesting, was expected and functionalized as a photovoltaic component in solar cells.234 2D Sb as a superior candidate as an anode material in Na-ion batteries has a specic capacity of 320 mA h g 1, an open circuit voltage of 1.22 V and a small diffusion barrier of 0.114 eV. Its high capacity and superior Na diffusion properties demonstrate its promise for application in Na–air batteries and supercapacitors.328 Functionalized arsenene (AsH and AsF) MLs had obvious light absorption in the nearinfrared and visible range of the solar spectrum, showing adsorption peaks in the range of 0.45–1.6 eV. This feature is attractive for light harvesting. Nontrivial QSH insulators (AsF, AsOH, and AsCH3) are promising candidates for photovoltaics.348 Partially oxidized arsenene with a tunable direct bandgap has potential in photovoltaic devices.353 Quasi-2D CuBi nanosheet superconductors have tunable electronic properties and moderate electron–phonon coupling (l¼ 0.5 and Tcz 1 K). CuBi nanosheet intercalated with Li shows high ion diffusivity, which can act as a candidate material to boost the rate capacity of current electrodes in Li-ion batteries.351\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019"

      "text" : "2D group-VA semiconductor materials are used as the body terminals of eld-effect transistors (FETs). FETs are indispensable building blocks of modern integrated circuits. Compared with graphene or MoS2 as channel materials of FETs, BP has two main merits, high on/off ratio for effective switching and charge carrier mobility for fast operation. Phosphorene FETs were fabricated based on few-layer phosphorene.44,385 Drain current modulation of FETs is in the order of 105 at room temperature and is four orders of magnitude larger than that in graphene. Their charge carrier mobility reached 1000 cm2 V 1 s 1, which is superior to that of silicon-based devices. Low on-state current and high sub-threshold swing were enhanced by optimizing gate dielectrics.385 Through the encapsulation of few-layer phosphorene between hexagonal boron nitride layers, a sandwiched heterostructure was prepared and used in FETs with ultra-clean interfaces.386 The device exhibited a mobility of 1350 cm2 V 1 s 1 at room temperature and an on–off ratio exceeding 105. The carrier mobility of BP is highly dependent on direction due to its structural anisotropy. A lower effective mass along the armchair direction induces a higher drive current at the same bias. A higher degree of anisotropy enhances the performance of p-type devices. The transport feature of devices depends on transport direction. The transport anisotropy is conducive to the on-state current improvement. There are some limitations in phosphorene FETs, which are attributed to their strong asymmetric ambipolar characteristics, high Schottky barrier and severe surface degradation.\nTo simplify circuit design and save layout area, ambipolar channel materials with both n- and p-type transports are used in complementary metal oxide semiconductor transistor logic circuits. Phosphorene FETs have ambipolar character, but ambipolar behavior is strongly asymmetric and is unfavorable for complementary logic devices. To balance ambipolar behavior, slow hole transport is improved through optimizing device structures, fabrication conditions and ake thickness. By in situ surface functionalization with Cs2CO3, a phosphorene FET was designed to achieve effective modulation of ambipolar behaviour.387 Aer coverage of 0.5 nm Cs2CO3, the on-current in electron regime was close to that in the hole regime, revealing a very symmetric and balanced ambipolar characteristic. With a thickness of Cs2CO3 larger than 10 nm, the electron mobility was distinctly improved, reaching 27 cm2 V 1 s 1, indicating improved electron transport behavior. Differently from BP or phosphorene, other 2D group-VA materials such as buckled arsenene or antimonene are highly stable when exposed to ambient conditions. ML arsenene or antimonene with a wide range of bandgaps has potential for FET applications. The performance of sub-10 nm ML arsenene/antimonene metal oxide semiconductor FETs (MOSFETs) was predicted.124,185 The electron mobility and hole mobility were 635 and 1700 cm2 V 1 s 1 for As (630 and 1737 cm2 V 1 s 1 for Sb), respectively.124 Excellent performance is applicable for ultra-scaled devices in the sub-10 nm scale.\nChen et al. reported an ML-trilayer lateral heterostructurebased FET (Fig. 22a–d).337 A low tunneling barrier and\nJ.

      "text" : "Topological insulators (TIs), as new quantum states of matters, attract much interest due to bulk insulating gaps and topologically protected boundary states. 2D TIs are promising materials compared to 3D TIs for spin transport applications because the edge states of 2D TIs are more robust against back scattering than the surface states of 3D TIs. Due to weak SOC, graphene as the rst predicted 2D TI with QSH effects suffers from deciencies of small bulk gap and low-temperature operation. 2D group-VA monoelemental MLs (phosphorene, arsenene, antimonene and bismuthene) have strong SOC effects over graphene and hold TIs phases under suitable conditions. For few-layer BP, a normal-to-topological phase transition was detected under an applied electric eld along the stacking direction.275 Four-layer phosphorene transformed from a normal insulator into a topological insulator at an electric eld of 0.3 V Å 1. Tunable topological behavior under an electric eld induces QSH effects. By using an in-plane time-periodic laser eld, phosphorene ML may possess Lifshitz transitions compared to topological insulating phases.389 Through FPC, arsenene and antimonene MLs become TIs under appropriate biaxial tensile strain larger than 11.7% (14.5%).194,291 The buckled conguration of arsenene (antimonene) had the capability of enduring large tensile strain of up to 18.4% (18%). The maximum bulk gaps were gained at maximum strain. Arsenene and antimonene are promising candidate materials of 2D TIs to achieve QSH effects.\nFlat honeycomb Sb or Bi ML grown on a ferromagnetic MnO2 layer was predicted, combining large intrinsic QSH and anomalous Hall conductivity.390 Due to proximity effects, h-Sb and h-Bi sheets weremagnetized. The Dirac points were split into different spin channels. There were intrinsic QSH states with large bandgaps of 228 meV for h-Sb and 941 meV for h-Bi. There were nearly quantized anomalous Hall states with a bandgap of 10 meV for h-Sb or h-Bi. This alternative practical method is efficient to obtain quantized intrinsic spin Hall states and anomalousHall conductance states in a single material. TIs are obtained by chemical functionalization of arsenene, antimonene and bismuthene. 2D TIs BiX/SbX (X ¼ H, F, Cl, and Br) MLs were predicted.391 Their large bulk bandgaps (0.32–1.08 eV) are due to the strong spin–orbit interactions of Bi/Sb atoms. BiX MLs with honeycomb structures are stable at high temperature. Thus, 2D TIs BiX/SbX MLs with intriguing features are candidates to develop new quantumdevices operating at room temperature. 2D TIs Bi/Sb/Pb bilayers with methyl-functionalization were predicted.349 Owing to the protected Dirac-type topological helical edge states, 2D TIs have suitable quantum spin Hall properties and a large nontrivial bulk gap of 0.9 eV for room-temperature applications. Antimonene oxide was used as a 2D TI with\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\na bandgap of 117 meV.192 Upon decoration with H and doping of magnetic atoms, Sb(111) MLs had topological properties of quantum spin-quantum anomalous Hall insulators with a bandgap of 53 meV.392 According to tight-binding models, hydrogenated Sb2H ML coated on an LaFeO3 substrate was used to study the topological properties of Sb2H/LaFeO3,393 and exotic quantum spin-quantum anomalous Hall states were observed. The bandgap opened up to 35 meV, which was enlarged by strain and electric elds. The freedom degree of carriers in heterostructures-based 2D TIs is tunable. Thus, 2D TIs have promising applications in electronics and spintronics.\nBismuthene with a bandgap of 0.8 eV is a good candidate as a high-temperature quantum spin Hall materials.99 Bismuthene grown on an SiC (0001) substrate was used as the stabilizer of quasi-2D TIs to form large gaps. Due to the strong on-site SOC, the on-current and intrinsic switching speed were improved in bismuthene/SiC 2D TIs. Ultrathin Sb islands grown on Bi2Te2Se were fabricated to develop Sb few-layer lms as 2D TI materials.164 As predicted for 3–4 bilayer lms, topological edge states emerged by 2D topological phase transition. Non-trivial phase transition and edge states were proven in epitaxial lms based on FPC. The evolution of the topological surface states in Sb(111) ultra-thin lms with 4–30 bilayers was studied.160 With a decrease in thickness, inter-surface coupling degraded the spin polarization of TSS and opened new wavevector-dependent scattering channels to cause spin degenerate states. Märkl et al. reported the successful realization of a-antimonene and predicted engineering multiple topological phases in van der Waals nano-heterostructures.86 Both the hexagonal b-form and rectangular a-form of antimonene were used to build islands on top of TI a-bismuthene. 2D TIs are topologically non-trivial materials in the quantum spin Hall class. Ning et al. provided unambiguous transport evidence for the topological 2D metallic surface states in thinner Bi nanoribbons.109 The free-standing quasi-2D layers of Te2Bi3 crystals were researched as new TIs in spintronic applications.111 Based on ab initio calculations, Wang et al. studied arsenene oxide (AsO) with high stability, exibility and tunable SOC gaps (Fig. 22e–g).354 Compared with pristine and functionalized arsenene, the maximum nontrivial bandgap of AsO was 89 meV, which became 130 meV under biaxial strain. A quantum well was designed by sandwiching 2D AsO between BN sheets. The band topology of AsO was retained with a sizeable bandgap. AsO possesses fully oxidized surfaces that are stable against surface oxidization and degradation. Group-VA 2D sheets are superior 2D TIs with large bulk gaps and have potential applications in 2D quantum spin Hall devices."

Topological edge states may coexist with superconductivity, making the Bi(111)/NbSe2 heterostructure a superior platform for exploring the Majorana fermions. 2D group-VA nanosheets can serve as semiconductor materials due to their high charge-carrier mobility, tunable direct bandgaps and in-plane anisotropic structures.

The superconductivity in organic intercalates of the Bi (2201) phase implied the 2D superconductivity of layered copper oxides. A distinct decrease in shielding fraction and broadening of the superconducting transition were observed aer intercalation of HgI2(pyridine)2, which can be understood based on the enhanced uctuation of 2D superconductors. Through FPC, the superconductivity in Liintercalated bilayer arsenene and hole-doped ML arsenene was studied, which exhibited a Tc of 8.68 K with an isotropic Eliashberg function.321 A small biaxial tensile strain (2%) improved the Tc to 11.22 K due to the increase in the DOS and phonon soening. The almost at top valence band of arsenene is suitable for 2D high-temperature superconductivity. The strain is crucial to enhance the transition temperature (Tc). Buckled honeycomb and symmetric washboard structures of ML arsenene are stable in the freestanding form.250 ML arsenene as a nonmagnetic semiconductor in energy is suitable for electronic applications. Based on calculations, ML arsenene has two phases and semiconducting behavior. When ML arsenene is functionalized with two types of organic molecules (electrophilic acceptors and nucleophilic donors), the interfacial charge transfer between ML arsenene and the acceptor–donor molecules reduces the bandgap of arsenene and leads to p- and n-\nwith and without magnetic field. dI/dV spectra of Bi(111) 1–7 BLs.

Bilayer and trilayer nanosheets are metallic, because valence electrons cannot fully occupy valence bands.352 A mixture of different nanosheets is responsible for the high electric conductivity of atomic thin lms. Besides semiconductor and superconductivity materials, 2D group-VA materials can be used as other advanced electronic materials, such as infrared detectors,310 metal electrodes,311 magnetic storage devices,256 and dissipationless transport devices.348 Lu et al. found the biaxial strain-tunable electronic properties of 2D As/Sb and h-BN/Sb van der Waals heterostructures with an indirect-to-direct gap transition.310 The tunable bandgaps from 1 to 0 eV correspond to a spectrum range from near-infrared to mid-infrared wavelengths, implying the potential applications of antimonene-based heterostructures in infrared detectors and photoelectric devices. The sensitivity of the bandgaps of van der Waals heterojunctions to external strain shows applications in microelectronics, piezoelectric and biomaterials, such as exible, wearable monitors of human body health.394 Theoretical studies revealed the superior interfacial properties of ML bismuthene–metal (Al, Ag, Au, Ir, Ti, and Pt) contacts, which provide guidance for the selection of metal electrodes in ML bismuthene devices.311 Through FPC, magnetic states were achieved for Ti, V, Cr, Mn and Fe doped-ML arsenene, showing uses in spintronics and magnetic storage devices.256 Nontrivial QSH insulators AsX (X ¼ F, OH, and CH3) MLs with obvious light absorption are candidates for room-temperature applications in dissipationless transport devices and photovoltaics.348 Similar to BP, other 2D layered group-VA (As, Sb, and Bi) nanomaterials will receive much attention in forthcoming studies and show signicant uses in transparent electrodes, advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices.50,52,62,63,108"

The FLA-coated microber device operated as an all-optical Kerr switcher with an extinction ratio up to 12 dB. This device operated as a four-wave mixing-based wavelength converter with a conversion efficiency of 63 dB. The modulated high-speed signal at a radio frequency of 18 GHz could be converted with the wavelength conversion device. FLA had a high nonlinear refractive index of up to 10 5 cm2 W 1.89 Because of their long-term stability in ambient conditions and high durability, 2D FLA-based nonlinear photonic devices (optical switchers, Kerr shutters, and beam shapers) can be used in next-generation, high-speed optical communication.

FLA has broadband nonlinear optical responses and potential as superior optical Kerr media with high stability.89,92 The performance of FLA-based devices is superior to its unstable counterpart phosphorene. FLA serves as a nonlinear optical medium for high-speed optical switching and wavelength conversion in optical communication.396,397\nTo employ the saturable absorber (SA) properties of FLA, an FLA-decorated microber was designed as an optical SA, allowing passive mode-locking and Q-switching operations at the telecommunication band.87 The microber had ultra-short pulse generation and all-optical thresholding with long-term stability. According to open-aperture Z-scan laser measurements, FLA is stable and has broadband nonlinear optical responses. In the mode-locking regime, pulses centered at 1.55 mm were detected with a pulse width of 550 fs. The intracavity pulse energy was 60 picojoules. In the Q-switching regime, a tunable pulse repetition rate of 20–50 kHz was obtained. Thus, this microber can serve as an effective optical thresholder to suppress the noise of pulses in transmission systems. The signal-to-noise ratio of the transmitted signals was improved up to 10 dB. These results provide guidance for the applications of 2D group-V monoelemental materials in ultra-short pulse generation and all-optical thresholding with long-term stability. Zhang et al. veried the superior nonlinear absorption properties of b-antimonene sheets, which were studied based on Zscan methods.82 Both saturated absorption and optical limiting were observed. Antimonene had intense saturated absorption and two-photon absorption properties.398 The nonlinear absorption at 1064 nm excitation is slightly better than that at 532 nm excitation. Antimonene is a promising candidate as an SA and optical limitingmaterial, such as invisible infrared laser. Based on the saturable absorption feature of 2D nanomaterials, a passive Q-switched Nd3+ solid-state laser with antimonene as the SA was realized (Fig. 23g).84 Upon 946 and 1064 nm laser emissions of Nd:YAG crystals, the Q-switched pulse widths were 209 and 129 ns and the peak powers were 1.48 and 1.77 W, respectively. Upon the 1342 nm laser emission of Nd:YVO4 crystals, the Q-switched pulse width was 48 ns and the peak power was 28.17 W. Antimonene can be employed as a stable broadband optical modulating device for solid-state lasers and exhibits effective long-wavelength operations.396,397\nFew-layer bismuthene was prepared via sonochemical exfoliation, and its nonlinear optical response in the visible region was studied.97 The nonlinear refractive index of bismuthene was 10 6 cm2 W 1, which was measured based on spatial selfphase modulation. Bismuthene has a direct energy bandgap at 1550 nm. Its saturable absorption properties were studied at the telecommunication band, showing an optical modulation depth of 2.03% and a saturable intensity of 30 MW cm 2. Under the optimal laser parameters, a 652 nm femtosecond (fs) optical pulse centered at 1559 nm was generated.

The PL emission peaks of few-layer phosphorene mainly originated from excitons, implying the lower bounds on its fundamental bandgaps. The key information provided in PL spectra promotes studies on the exciton features and electronic structures in phosphorene. The PL spectra of ML and bi- and trilayer phosphorene were measured at 77 K under the unpolarized photoexcitation of 2.33 eV.402 The PL peak energy matched well with the absorption spectra, verifying the direct bandgap of phosphorene. Defect state-derived near-infrared PL emission was detected in phosphorene.403 With a linear increase in excitation intensity, sublinear increase in PL intensity at 1240 nm was obtained, which veried the defect-based emission of phosphorene. The defect emission was much brighter than the exciton emission at low temperature, and the brightness of the defect emission was retained at room temperature. Bright room-temperature PL emission can serve as a light source for near-infrared optoelectronics.\nThe PL emission of 2D group-VA materials beyond phosphorene was demonstrated.

There are two main factors that cause bandgap opening. One is the quantum connement effect caused by dimensionality reduction, and the other is turbostratic stacking. Multilayer antimonene nanoribbons uniformly distributed on InSb were prepared via a plasma-assisted process and had room-temperature orange PL (Fig. 24).96 Notably, the bandgap opening was induced by the quantum connement effect of the nanoribbon structures and turbostratic stacking of the antimonene layers, including various types of stacking, such as AA stacking.77 Based on the orange PL emission at 610 nm, the bandgap of the multilayer antimonene nanoribbons was 2.03 eV. PL measurements suggested that 2D multilayer arsenene and antimonene nanoribbons with proper band structures have potential use in transistors and light-emitting diodes. Hussain et al. prepared free-standing ultrathin Bi nanosheets (BiNSs) with superior PL (Fig. 24a–d).72 The PL spectra of the BiNSs were measured at room temperature upon excitation of 325 nm and exhibited a sharp peak at 661 nm. This peak vanished upon 532 nm excitation since it came from the second harmonic generation of the 325 nm laser. The PL responses of large-area and high crystalline BiNSsmay be due to the carrier connement effect. The process-dependent crystal defect and dislocation caused the trapping of electrons and excitons in ultrathin BiNSs. Further theoretical and experimental studies are needed to study the PL emission of 2D groupVA elemental materials for their signicant applications, especially in optical sensors, bioimaging, transistors, light-emitting diodes and optoelectronic devices.50,62,89,395,404–408"

The absence of bandgaps for typical 2D materials, such as 2D group-IVA materials, restrains their use in semiconductor devices (gas sensors). 2D group-VA materials with moderate bandgaps of 0.36–2.62 eV have emerging and fascinating physical properties, rendering them superior candidates for gas detection.47,409–411 The adsorption of CO, CO2, NH3, NO and NO2 gas molecules on ML phosphorene was studied by FPC coupled with non-equilibrium Green's functions.258 Compared with graphene and MoS2, phosphorene exhibits stronger adsorption of gas molecules with higher sensitivity and selectivity, implying its potential as an efficient gas sensor. Phosphorene is sensitive to N-containing gas molecules (NO and NO2). There is a dramatic I–V relation change before and aer gas adsorption on phosphorene. The adsorption of gas molecules on phosphorene has signicant transport features and current/resistance changes. By theoretical calculations, the sensing of NO2 gas occurred on few-layer phosphorene-based FETs.409 Through Raman spectroscopy measurements, there was no obvious change in the characteristic peaks before and aer target gas adsorption, implying stable NO2 adsorption on multilayer phosphorene. The limit of detection of the phosphorene-based gas sensor was estimated to be 5 ppb of NO2, showing high sensitivity for gas detection.\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nThe conductance measurements revealed that the sensor had reversible adsorption and desorption of NO2 gas and high recovery aer ushing the sensor device with Ar.\nCho et al. studied the gas-sensing performance of phosphorene, graphene and MoS2.410 Through electrical sensing measurements, the sensitivity of phosphorene was determined to be 20 times higher than that of graphene and MoS2. The excellent performance in response/recovery time, selectivity, molar response factor and adsorption veried that phosphorene is a superior gas sensing material. Besides NO2, phosphorene was sensitive to methanol vapor.411 In the presence of other vapors, the phosphorene-based sensing device was selective for methanol and had long-term stability. Other 2D group-VA nanomaterials were predicted to be gas sensing materials, such as the typical buckled arsenene and antimonene.329,333 Arsenene had high sensitivity to gas molecules.257,331 Liu et al. studied the adsorption of CO, CO2, N2, NH3, NO and NO2 on ML arsenene.257 NOx adsorbents had the largest charge transfer and greater changes in conductivity. The adsorption of NOx led to a magnetic moment of 1 mB. Thus, arsenene is a candidate for NO and NO2 gas sensing. Through FPC, some gases (N2, CO2, O2, H2O, and CO) were weakly adsorbed on antimonene. Other toxic air-pollution gases (NH3, SO2, and NO) can be strongly adsorbed on antimonene, with considerable adsorption energies and elevated charge transfers.335 This is ascribed to the contribution of the frontier orbitals of molecules closer to the Fermi level and apparent orbital hybridization. The moderate adsorption energies, appreciable charge transfer and physical adsorption features of antimonene make a potential pollutant gas sensor to detect NH3, SO2 and NO gases. Antimonene enabled the adsorption and desorption of these gases easily. Antimonene with NO2 activated and chemisorbed can serve as a disposable gas sensor or metal-free catalyst to detect and catalyze NO2 gas.\nThe sensitivity of CO to antimonene was evaluated by FPC.332 CO adsorption on pristine antimonene is physical adsorption and it is converted to chemical adsorption aer its doping with atoms. An external electric eld varying from 0.5 to 0.21 eV Å 1 improves the sensitivity of CO on doped antimonene, which is helpful to realize CO gas sensing at room temperature. The adsorption and desorption of CO molecules on doped antimonene can be controlled via an external electric eld, which is more suitable for gas collection, storage and sensing compared to pristine antimonene. Different types of doped antimonene (Si–Sb, Al–Sb and Co–Sb nanosheets) were explored as potential sensing materials for CO detection. NO2 or SO2 gas had chemisorption on B-doped arsenene and had physisorption on pristine or N-doped arsenene with moderate adsorption energies (Fig. 25a–e).333 When two gas molecules were adsorbed on pristine or doped arsenene, a positive change in electronic properties was detected through the density of states (DOS) analysis. According to the I–V characteristic curves, the conductivity of pristine (N-doped) arsenene was enhanced obviously aer NO2 (SO2) adsorption due to the increase in holecarriers. N-doped arsenene was applied as a new material for SO2 gas sensing. Pristine arsenene has potential application in NO2 gas sensing, showing high sensitivity.\nJ. Mater. Chem.

H2 acted as the charge donor to antimonene, with 10 times higher charge transfer than H2 on phosphorene. The interaction of O2 with antimonene was much stronger than that with phosphorene. Pristine antimonene may suffer from oxidation in ambient conditions especially at elevated temperature. The kinetic barrier for the splitting of O2 molecules on antimonene is low ( 0.4 eV). Different from the donor role of H2O in phosphorene, the acceptor role of H2O on antimonene suppresses the structure degradation of oxidized antimonene by preventing proton transfer between the H2O molecule and O2 species to yield acids.

The ZT value along the armchair direction is much larger than that along the zig-zag direction.420,422–424 By p-/n-doping and orthogonal electric elds, the thermoelectric performance of phosphorene was predicted and improved. The gure of merit ZT reached up to 1.5 along the armchair direction at room temperature.225 The inuence of applied strain on the thermoelectric effect of BP was studied.419,421,425 Upon 5% applied strain along the zig-zag direction of phosphorene, the Seebeck coefcient and electrical conductivity were improved dramatically. Upon 8% applied strain along the armchair direction of phosphorene, the ZT was 2.12 at room temperature.421 High thermoelectric properties of phosphorene were achieved by cutting phosphorene along the armchair and zig-zag directions to form engineered nanostructures.426 The ZT of phosphorene nanoribbons with armchair edges was optimized to be 6.4 at room temperature, indicating their excellent thermoelectric use.\nSandonas et al. reported the thermoelectric properties of puckered phosphorene and arsenene.420 Puckered arsenene had stronger anisotropic thermoelectric responses than phosphorene. Arsenene had moderate n-type doping at 300 K. The ZT of arsenene reached up to 1.0 along the armchair direction. Buckled antimonene had a relatively low thermal conductivity, which was further lowed by chemical functionalization.216 Antimonene may be a potential and excellent thermoelectric material. Cheng et al. investigated the gure of merit, ZT, of buckled and puckered bismuthene at different temperatures.209,217 Based on FPC combined with the Boltzmann transport equation, buckled bismuthene had much larger ZT than its bulk structure.209 Large power factors (S2s) and low thermal conductivity are responsible for the high thermoelectric performance of buckled bismuthene. The ZT of buckled bismuthene reached 2.4 at room temperature and 4.1 at 500 K. Based on theoretical predictions, puckered bismuthene had a high ZT of 6.4 for n-type systems at room temperature.217 ZT distinctly exceeded that of buckled bismuthene with a ZT of 2.4.209 The ZT of the buckled bismuthene was higher than 2.0 in a broad region of temperature and carrier concentration. Puckered bismuthene with low deformation potential constants and excellent thermoelectric features is inherently relative to weak electron-phonon coupling strength.\nSun et al. investigated the thermoelectric transport properties of arsenene featuring puckered and buckled structures.221 The two types of arsenene as indirect bandgap semiconductors had high charge carriermobilities in the range of 40–800 cm2 V 1 s 1. The puckered arsenene had low and anisotropic lattice thermal conductivities of 9.6 W m 1 K 1 in the armchair direction and 30.7Wm 1 K 1 in the zig-zag direction.

According to FPC, puckered arsenene is a good thermoelectric material. Sharma et al. studied the thermoelectric properties of arsenene and antimonene (Fig. 26a and b).220 Both materials had large bandgaps and low lattice thermal conductivities, resulting in large Seebeck coefficients. Compared with arsenene, antimonene has smaller phonon frequencies and group velocities at room temperature, causing sensitive thermoelectric responses. A ZT of up to 0.58 was achieved through moderate n-type doping of 1013 cm 2. The room-temperature ZT of ML bismuth was calculated to be 2.1 for n-type doping and 2.4 for p-type doping (Fig. 26c).209 The maximal ZT of 4.1 was achieved at 500 K. For the distorted bismuth (110) layer, the maximum ZT of 6.4 was achieved for n-type systems, stemming from the weak scattering of electrons.217 The distorted Bi layer maintained a high ZT in a wide temperature and carrier concentration range. Deformation potential constant with electron–phonon scattering strength is the paradigm in the search for high-performance thermoelectric materials. The buckled antimonene had a ZT of 2.15 at room temperature.223 Aer simple biaxial strain engineering, the ZT increased to 2.9 under 3% tensile strain (Fig. 26d), which is attributed to its tunable electronic structures and reduced thermal conductance. Recently, fabricated buckled antimonene was stable in ambient conditions, making it a new candidate for application in thermoelectric devices.

BP has a wide electrochemical cathodic window because it is not highly electrocatalytic for hydrogen evolution. Nevertheless, its anodic window is somewhat limited due to the electrochemical oxidation of BP itself, 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at neutral pH.436 BP shows signicant anisotropic electrochemical properties, with much faster heterogeneous electron transfer at its edge sites compared with its basal plane, similar to that of graphite and MoS2.42 This feature is conducive to the sensing of electroactive biomolecules at the edge plane sites of BP monocrystal electrodes.\nDue to the intrinsic unique properties of BP, including negligible elemental cytotoxicity, high drug-loading potential, long blood circulation time and specic clearance pathways, in\nJ.

Under the irradiation of an 808 nm laser, the dye-modied BP showed strong photothermal therapy and near-infrared imaging in MCF7 breast tumor-bearing nude mice. Besides, the photodynamic theranostics and drug release of BP have been developed towards cancer therapy in vivo,429,430,432,435 similar to other 2D nanomaterials such as 2D boron nanosheets.438 Besides BP, other 2D layered group-VA nanomaterials have been explored for biomedical applications. Recently, Xue et al. reported a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor based on 2D antimonene for the specic label-free detection of clinically relevant biomarkers miRNA-21 and miRNA-155.427 The\n25760 | J.

This biosensor is the rst report that uses antimonene for clinically relevant nucleic acid detection, constituting an extraordinary opportunity to develop lab-on-chip platforms.\nTao et al. developed a photonic drug-delivery platform based on 2D PEGylated antimonene nanosheets that had multiple advantages,439 including excellent photothermal, high drugloading, spatiotemporally controllable drug release triggered by near-infrared light and moderate acidic pH, high accumulation at tumor sites, deep tumor penetration by both extrinsic NIR light and intrinsic pH stimulus, multimodal-imaging and inhibition of tumor growth without side effects and potential degradability, which addressed several key limitations of cancer nanomedicine (Fig. 27b).

Currently, the biomedical applications of 2D layered group-VA pnictogen materials and pnictogencontaining 2D hybrids are still rarely reported, such as some relative studies on antimonene.427,439 The forthcoming biomedical studies of 2D layered group-VA pnictogen materials are rationally driven by the explosive development of their cousin BP or other 2D materials such as graphene, TMDs, MXenes, and MOFs.\nIn recent years, the ultralow and non-toxic properties of BP have facilitated its explosive development in biomedical\nFig. 27 (a) Fabrication of a miRNA sensor integrated with antimonene na antimonene–miRNA hybridization events.

      "text" : "Different from semimetallic group-IVA and metallic group-IIIA materials, 2D layered group-VA monoelemental nanomaterials are semiconductors with a broad range of fundamental bandgaps that can be tuned from 0.36 to 2.62 eV, which give them great potential as promising candidates for application in advanced nanodevices. The recent signicant advances in emerging 2D group-VA materials have aroused numerous scientists to accelerate the discovery of new 2D materials that have many intriguing physiochemical properties, functional structures and important applications. Compared with phosphorene and BP, 2D group-VA pnictogenmonoelemental (As, Sb and Bi) nanomaterials possess superior stability, tunable direct bandgaps, charge-carrier mobility and unique in-plane anisotropic structures, making them superior candidates for efficient applications in extensive research areas. This present review performed a timely and comprehensive overview of the principal theoretical and experimental studies on 2D group-VA nanomaterials beyond BP reported in recent years, focusing on their general synthetic methods, fundamental properties, functionalized nanostructures and potential applications.\nThe synthetic methods for 2D group-VA materials were divided into top-down and bottom-up methods. The top-down methods include mechanical, ultrasonic, electrochemical exfoliation, plasma-assisted process, and hot-pressing method. The bottom-up methods mainly mention molecular beam epitaxy, van der Waals epitaxy, chemical vapor deposition, solvothermal, hydrothermal synthesis, high-temperature melting, etc. Different methods have particular merits towards various research objectives. The large-scale preparation of 2D group-VA materials with high stability against oxidation and degradation is especially crucial for enhancing their physiochemical properties and versatile practical applications. The combination of different methods is considered an effective strategy to prepare high-quality 2D group-VA materials. For the top-down methods, mechanical and electrochemical exfoliations can yield multilayer nanosheets from bulk crystals or powder. Then, ultrasonic\n25762 | J. Mater. Chem. A, 2019, 7, 25712–25771\nexfoliation efficiently transfers multilayer nanosheets into fewor single-layer nanosheets. In the case of the bottom-up methods, molecular beam epitaxy, van der Waals epitaxy and chemical vapor deposition are suitable for the preparation of 2D group-VA pnictogen monoelemental materials, while pnictogen-containing hybrids are oen prepared from solvothermal and hydrothermal synthesis and high-temperature melting. The combination of two bottom-up methods can promote the realization of new 2D group-VA pnictogen hybrids or new heterostructures with unique structures and enhanced properties. The assistance of organic ligands during the preparation process can improve the stability of the products. Thus, future studies should focus on the exploration and improvement of the synthetic methods, mainly considering low-cost, environmentally friendly raw materials, facile manipulation, low-energy-consuming process and high productivity.\nAccording to theoretical predictions and experimental studies, 2D group-VA materials belong to semiconductors and have tunable direct bandgaps, unique in-plane anisotropy and superior carrier transport capability, facilitating their promising applications in advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices. Great efforts have been devoted to the investigations of the mechanical, thermal, optical, magnetic and electronic properties of 2D group-VA materials. These fundamental properties are mentioned, but some challenges still remain. Thus, forthcoming studies need to elucidate the electron structure-relatedmechanisms to improve the present properties of 2D group-VA materials and extend these properties to new research elds. The combination of theoretical models and practical experiments is an indispensable way to explore new 2D group-VA nanostructures, which are expected to gain novel and superior properties. In the case of 2D group-VA pnictogen materials, some signicant properties are still hardly reported, such as photothermal effects and upconversion luminescence properties. Similar to phosphorene and BP,53,54,58,440 these nanomaterials have a wide optical absorption covering the visible-light to infrared regions, implying their excellent thermoelectric properties. They are expected to exhibit photothermal properties for phototherapy. These nanomaterials possess tunable broadband nonlinear optical absorption for application in nonlinear photonic devices and down-conversion PL for light-emission devices.56,395,398 These results imply the potential upconversion luminescence of 2D group-VA pnictogen nanomaterials for bioimaging applications, which need to be further veried in future studies. The forthcoming studies will be rationally driven by the explosive development of other 2D materials, such as BP, graphene, TMDs, MXenes, and MOFs.\n2D group-VA nanomaterials can be further modied to fabricate various functional nanostructures for a wide range of applications. Functional nanostructures mainly involve hybrid heterostructures, doping of atoms and molecules, surface functionalization of 2D group-VA nanomaterials and pnictogencontaining 2D hybrids. Notably, the synergistic interactions between nanomaterials and other 2D or low-dimensional nanomaterials can result in novel and improved physiochemical properties in the resultant hybrid materials. Functional nanostructures consisting of 2D group-VA nanomaterials\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\n2 3\nO ct\nob er\n2 01\n9.

Based on the synergistic enhancement effects between typical 2D graphene (or counterparts) and zerodimensional (0D) noble nanoclusters (or quantum dots), the electronic conductivity of 2D–0D hybrids can be improved efficiently, which have high capability for use in sensors and intelligent electronic devices.441–446 In forthcoming studies, various novel and functionalized nanostructures, such as 2D– 0D, 2D–1D heterostructures and hybrids, will be smartly designed and fabricated based on group-VA nanomaterials. These newly developed heterostructures and hybrids are expected to exhibit novel and synergistically enhanced physiochemical properties for use in advanced nanodevices and intelligent systems.\nAer functional modication, 2D group-VA pnictogen materials-based systems have a broad range of signicant applications involving popular research elds, such as catalysis, energy storage, eld-effect transistors, topological spintronic devices, electronic devices, nonlinear photonics, light emitting devices, gas sensors, thermoelectric materials and biomedicine. These applications are explored based on both theoretical calculations and experimental studies, but the practical performance stabilities and device efficiencies of these systems are still required to be further improved when compared with typical 2D nanomaterials-based systems and commercialized nanodevices. The superior properties of 2D group-VA nanomaterials can be realized by improving their synthetic methods and functional structures. Thus, future studies should focus on rational design schemes and optimized fabrication procedures for advanced functional systems with the use of 2D group-VA pnictogen nanomaterials. The improved systems and devices with high-performance stability and efficiency will receive promising applications in current elds. They will nd new opportunities for applications in other extended and signicant elds, including phototherapy, biomedical imaging, electrochemical sensing, exible and wearable devices, intelligent electronics, and versatile optoelectronics.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."

    "abstractText" : "As an emerging group of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, 2D group-VA layered nanomaterials have been attracting increasing attention in recent years due to their intriguing physiochemical properties and functional structures for broad and promising applications. In contrast to phosphorene and black phosphorus, 2D group-VA pnictogen elemental (As, Sb, and Bi) nanomaterials have tunable direct bandgaps, high stability, charge-carrier mobility and unique in-plane anisotropic structures, giving them great prospects for applications in significant and extensive research areas. In this review, we systematically introduced the recent advances in 2D group-VA nanomaterials beyond black phosphorus. First, the synthesis methods were summarized and grouped into top-down and bottom-up categories. Then, their fundamental properties were described, referring to their band structures and carrier transport as well as mechanical, thermal, optical, magnetic and electronic properties. Subsequently, functional nanostructures were discussed, such as heterostructures, doping, absorption, pnictogencontaining hybrids and surface functionalization. Finally, potential applications were illustrated, involving catalysis, energy storage, field-effect transistors, topological spintronic devices, electronic devices, nonlinear photonics, light-emitting devices, gas sensors, thermoelectric materials and biomedicine. Finally, the current states, challenges and perspectives for the emerging 2D group-VA nanomaterials were discussed rationally. This timely and comprehensive review is attractive for scientists from different research fields and promotes the further development of low-dimensional nanomaterials and functionalized hybrid materials.",
