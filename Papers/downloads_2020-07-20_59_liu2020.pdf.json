Due to their large specific surface areas, exceptional chemical, mechanical, thermal and cost effective characteristics, nanomaterials should be ideal carriers for the immobilization of enzymes. Enzymes immobilized on nano-carriers are more robust and stable, and can be recycled and reused. This review focuses on the nanomaterial immobilized enzymes and their applications. The introduction addresses the advantages of immobilized enzymes and the features of enzyme immobilization nanocarriers. The next section covers carbonaceous nanomaterials used in enzymes immobilization, with subsections on carbon nanotube, graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide. The third section treats metallic nanomaterials for enzymes immobilization, with subsections on metal (gold), metal oxide (titanium dioxide, zinc oxide) and metal hydroxide (layered double hydroxide) nanomaterials.

      "text" : "Enzymes, macromolecular biological catalysts that accelerate biochemical and chemical reactions, have been extensively used in various fields due to their high catalytic efficiency and substrate specificity under mild reaction conditions (mild pH, temperature and pressure) [1]. Nevertheless, their applications are severely limited by the poor stability and reusability properties. The immobilization technique, first developed in 1916 [2], have broadened the applications of enzymes. After immobilization, enzymes are expected to react in harsh environments such as organic solvents, extreme pH and temperature with enhanced catalytic activity and reusability.\nImmobilization method is a key issue for enzymes immobilization, and enzymes are commonly immobilized by entrapment [3,4], adsorption [5], covalent [6,7], and cross-linking [8] methods. Entrapment and adsorption can be assigned as physical immobilization methods, since no covalent interactions are involved between the enzyme molecules and the carriers. Besides, covalent and cross-linking belong to chemical immobilization methods, since enzyme molecules are immobilized on the carriers by covalent bonds. Moreover, carbodiimide coupling technique [7] and glutaraldehyde (GA) crosslinking method [8] are typical for chemical immobilization of enzymes onto nanocarriers.\nBesides immobilization method, immobilization carrier is also a key\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2020.02.005 Received 9 October 2019; Received in revised form 9 December 2019; Accepted 4 February 2020\nAbbreviations: GA, glutaraldehyde; CNTs, carbon nanotubes; G, graphene; GO, graphene oxide; rGO, reduced graphene oxide; SWCNTs, single-walled carbon nanotubes; MWCNTs, multi-walled carbon nanotubes; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; SEM, scanning electron microscopy; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; EDC, l-ethyl-3-(dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide; MWCNTs-COOH, carboxyl-functionalized MWCNTs; CS, chitosan; PVA, polyvinyl alcohol; 2D, two-dimensional; GOD, glucose oxidase; IL, ionic liquid; PFIL, polyethylenimine-functionalized ionic liquid; PVP, polyvinylpyrrolidone; GCE, glassy carbon electrode; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; AFM, atomic force microscopy; OxOx, oxalate oxidase; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentrations; GOCOOH, carboxyl-functionalized GO; PEG, polyethylene glycol; AuNPs, gold nanoparticles; AuNRs, gold nanorods; AuNWs, gold nanowires; CTAB, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide; SIase, sucrose isomerase; EPL, ε-poly-L-lysine; M-TiO2, mesoporous TiO2; SI-EPL-M-TiO2, EPL-M-TiO2 immobilized SIase; ADA, adenosine deaminase; APTES, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane; LDHs, layered double hydroxides; LDHNSs, LDH nanosheets; XRD, X-ray diffraction; HNTs, halloysite nanotubes; MOFs, metal-organic frameworks\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

Nanomaterials are expected to be favorable carriers as they can meet the requirements of immobilization carriers; although some may not be very suitable for enzymes immobilization, as enzymes tend to form aggregates with altered properties. Diverse nanoscaffolds such as particles [10], wires [11], tubes [12], rods [13], sheets [14] and fibers [15] have been reported and applied in enzymes immobilization. Based on element classification, nanomaterials are mainly classified into carbonaceous and metallic ones. In addition, other nanomaterials such as silica-, chitosan- and cellulose-based ones used as enzyme immobilization supports are also reviewed. The applications of nanomaterials in enzymes immobilization and their performances are summarized and evaluated."

      "text" : "CNTs, containing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), are one-dimensional hollow tubes composed of carbon atoms. CNTs exhibit increasing application prospects in enzymes immobilization with their unique electrical, mechanical, and thermal features as well as good biocompatibility. Arc discharge, laser ablation, chemical vapor deposition, and high-pressure carbon monoxide disproportionation have been reported for the synthesis of CNTs [36].\nVia hydrophobic interaction and π-π stacking interaction, laccase was immobilized on MWCNTs for kinetic, thermodynamic and stability study [5]. The immobilized laccase was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Comparing the FTIR spectra of laccase, MWCNTs, and MWCNTs immobilized laccase, the results suggested that hydrophobic interactions play a major role in the adsorption of laccase on MWCNTs. Furthermore, changes in pH have no influence on the immobilization yield of laccase, indicating that the immobilization process is not dependent on electrostatic interactions. After immobilization, laccase exhibited higher Km value, implying lower affinity to substrate, and this might be due to the masstransfer limitations that restrict the accessibility of substrate to the active site. The results of the thermodynamic study indicated that immobilized laccase showed poor stability. This phenomenon may be due to the desorption of laccase from MWCNTs at high temperature. After immobilization, laccase exhibited higher catalytic activity than its initial value even at the ninth cycle and retained 67 % of its initial value after 34 days, suggesting enhanced operational and storage stability.\nFeng’s team conducted some research on the immobilization of enzyme with MWCNTs [38,39], which contributed to the understanding of the activation mechanism of MWCNTs immobilized enzymes [12]. In these studies, lipases were covalently attached to MWCNTs based on carbodiimide coupling technique [38,39]. MWCNTs were first purified with HNO3 and oxidized with the mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3 to introduce carboxyl groups. After activation with L-ethyl-3-\n(dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), lipase was immobilized on the carboxylfunctionalized MWCNTs (MWCNTs-COOH) through acylamide bond (Fig. 1). After immobilization, lipase showed less temperature dependence and higher resolution efficiency. The circular dichroism and FTIR spectra showed the changes of secondary structure of the immobilized lipase, which may result in the decrease of enzymatic activity. However, the catalytic activity of lipase is significantly improved in organic solvent after being attached to MWCNTs. Previous work indicated that the activation of lipase by immobilization is ascribed to the lid opening of the active site [40]. In order to understand the mechanism of lid opening of the immobilized lipase, the molecular model was utilized [12]. The results suggested that the enzyme might be site-specifically immobilized onto a hydrophobic support, thus obtaining enhanced catalytic activity. The performance of kinetic resolution of racemic compounds was also investigated by immobilizing lipase on MWCNTsCOOH through carbodiimide coupling method [41].\nXu et al. prepared MWCNTs immobilized laccase for the biodegradation of diclofenac [17]. MWCNTs were first mixed with chitosan (CS) to obtain CS/MWCNTs gel, which was then mixed with a mixture of tetraethyl orthosilicate, acetic acid and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) for the preparation of PVA/CS/MWCNTs gel. Then based on Schiff base reaction, laccase was immobilized on the amino-rich PVA/CS/MWCNTs gel with the coupling agent of GA (Fig. 2). The performance of PVA/CS/ MWCNTs immobilized laccase was studied and compared with that of PVA/CS immobilized laccase. The immobilized laccase retained 72.7 % of its initial activity after 7 cycles and about 80 % of its initial activity after 30 days. The results of this study showed that the higher the enzyme loading, the higher the removal efficiency of diclofenac. The better stability, reusability and storage stability of the PVA/CS/ MWCNTs immobilized laccase can be attributed to the existence of MWCNTs. MWCNTs may enhance the electron transfer between the enzyme and substrate molecule, consequently improving the catalytic activity of laccase. Based on a similar technique which involves using sodium triphosphate pentabasic instead of PVA, β-glucosidase was immobilized on CS-modified MWCNTs for the application of aroma enhancement in tea extracts. For reusability study, after each cycle, the immobilized β-glucosidase was separated by filtration and washed with incubation buffer, and then the continuous enzymatic reaction was performed by mixing the recovered immobilized enzyme with substrate. The immobilized β-glucosidase retained 72.83 % of its initial activity after 10 cycles [21]. The incomplete recovery of enzyme activity may be due to the substrate diffusional limitations imposed by the considerably high amount of reaction product accumulated on the biocatalyst surfaces and/or the inactivation and desorption of enzyme molecules adsorbed on the nano-carrier surfaces [42]. Laccase was also covalently immobilized on the MWCNTs-COOH based on carbodiimide coupling technique. With good reusability and improved stability, the immobilized laccase was used for Reactive Black 5 decolorization [23]."

      "text" : "G, a single-atom-thick two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb network of carbon atoms, has attracted increasing attentions in diverse rapidly developed fields owing to its high surface area (∼2630 m2 g−1), strong mechanical strength, and extraordinary electrical, thermal and optical features [43]. G seems to be an ideal carrier for enzyme immobilization due to the aforementioned remarkable properties. The huge surface area helps to increase the enzyme loading and the favorable mechanical strength increases the reusability of enzyme. In addition, G immobilized enzymes are mainly applied in biosensors because of the exceptional electrical conductivity of G.\nShan et al. immobilized glucose oxidase (GOD) on G-polyethylenimine-functionalized ionic liquid (G-PFIL) for the preparation of an electrochemical glucose sensor in which G was previously protected with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) [28].

In addition, it is biocompatible for enzyme immobilization and the counter-anion in its film favours electrostatic adsorption of negatively charged GOD. For the first time, with the help of PVP and PFIL, G was used to immobilize GOD as biosensor. The biosensor is superior to the previous one based on CNTs [44], as it showed a wider linearity range from 2 to 14 mM, which ensured the detection of blood sugar.\nGOD was also immobilized on the G-CS film modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for the preparation of electrochemical glucose sensor [27]. CS, rich in amino groups and carried with -NH3+ groups in aqueous solution, can adsorb negatively charged materials. This feature facilitated the electrostatic adsorption of negatively charged GOD on the positively charged G-CS film. The electron transfer resistance was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and the results indicated that GOD was steadily adsorbed into the G-CS film. The good biocompatibility of CS and high surface area and superior conductivity of G resulted in the superb performances (good catalytic activity and stability, wider linearity range, lower detection limit and higher sensitivity) of the biosensor."

      "text" : "Graphene oxide (GO), the precursor of graphene, is considered as an ideal enzyme immobilization carrier due to its ultra-high surface area, exceptional thermal and mechanical properties. Besides, GO possesses substantial oxygen-containing functional groups such as carboxyl, epoxy, and hydroxyl groups, which is favorable for enzyme immobilization. The Brodie, Staudenmaier, Hummers and modified Hummers methods have been reported for the synthesis of GO through the oxidation of graphite [45]. GO immobilized enzymes have shown different catalytic activities when GO nanosupports are prepared by\ndifferent methods [34]. rGO, which lacks surface functional groups, is obtained when GO is reduced to some degree. Enzyme can be electrostatically adsorbed, covalently attached or crosslinked on GO, and hydrophobically adsorbed on rGO. Hermanová et al. prepared the GO immobilized lipase by physical adsorption, covalent attachment and crosslinking, respectively [34].\nHorseradish peroxidase (HRP) and lysozyme were separately immobilized on GO, and the interactions between enzyme molecules and GO were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) [30,31]. The results showed that enzymes were electrostatically adsorbed on the surface of GO due to its rich surface functional groups. In addition, the electrostatic interaction between enzyme molecule and GO severely affected the catalytic activity of immobilized enzyme. Lacking surface functional groups, rGO had little effect on the catalytic behavior of immobilized enzyme as hydrophobic interaction replaced the electrostatic interaction between enzyme molecule and carrier. HRP and oxalate oxidase (OxOx) were separately immobilized on rGO by hydrophobic interaction and the obtained rGO immobilized enzyme showed higher enzyme loading, better stability and higher activity compared with the GO immobilized enzyme [32].\nDuan et al. prepared the GO and rGO immobilized lysozyme-based membrane for antibacterial study [33]. The schematic illustration of immobilizing of lysozyme on GO and rGO is presented in Fig. 3. In this work, GO was prepared by the oxidation of graphite with an improved Hummers method and rGO was prepared by the reduction of GO with ascorbic acid. The lysozyme was immobilized on GO by electrostatic interaction and on rGO by hydrophobic interaction. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of GO and rGO immobilized lysozyme were studied and the results showed that the MIC of rGO immobilized lysozyme is lower than that of GO immobilized lysozyme. This can be explained by the fact that hydrophobic interaction slightly affects lysozyme activity compared with electrostatic interaction, which is\nconsistent with the literature [27]. By carbodiimide coupling method, lipase was covalently immobilized on the carboxyl-functionalized GO (GO-COOH) [14]. During the immobilization process, lipase was also hydrophobically adsorbed on the GO-COOH sheets. In organic environment, the immobilized lipase showed significantly higher catalytic activity compared with the free one. This can be explained by the fact that the hydrophobic interaction made the lid more open, thus exposing more active sites. Trypsin was also immobilized on GO-COOH by carbodiimide coupling method to provide a simple and efficient approach for high throughput protein identification [46].\nXu et al. immobilized cellulase on polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified GO nanosheets to enhance its ionic liquid tolerance in the application of saccharification of lignocellulose [47]. The PEGylated GO was prepared by chemical binding of 4-arm-PEG-NH2 and GO with the help of EDC. Then, using GA as coupling agent, cellulase was covalently immobilized on the PEGylated GO based on Schiff base reaction. The schematic illustration of preparing PEGylated GO-cellulase is presented in Fig. 4. After immobilized on PEGylated GO, cellulase retained 61 % of its initial activity and showed more than 30 times enhancement in\nionic liquid tolerance compared with free cellulase. The immobilized cellulase showed similar Km value compared with the free one, indicating that the immobilized cellulase would exhibit similar performance with the free one. In the presence of pretreatment solution of ionic liquid, the PEGylated GO-cellulase was applied in hydrolysis of rice straw and showed high efficiency. This study provides a one-pot and wash-free method for hydrolyzing lignocellulose."

      "text" : "Among metal nanomaterials, gold nanomaterials are the most extensively used for enzymes immobilization due to their large surface area, good thermal and mechanical stability, ease of functionalization\nas well as favorable biocompatibility. Gold nanomaterials have been synthesized by citrate reduction method, two-phase reduction method, seed-mediated growth method, etc., which have been comprehensively reviewed by Dreaden and coworkers [48]. Enzymes have been immobilized on naked or functionalized gold nanomaterials by chemical adsorption [10], physical adsorption [49], cross-linking [50] or covalent attachment [51]. Besides, gold nanomaterials are always fixed on other nanocarriers for enzyme immobilization [52]. The gold nanomaterial-immobilized enzymes are always applied in biosensors and their performances are listed in Table 2.\nEnzymes can be chemisorbed on gold nanomaterials based on the covalent interactions between gold nanomaterials and the amino or thiol groups of enzyme molecules. Luo et al. fixed HRP on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified gold electrode [10]. In this work, the gold electrode was first deposited with porous chitosan films for the introduction of amino groups. Then, based on the Au-NH2 interactions, AuNPs were self-assembled on the chitosan film. HRP was finally chemisorbed on the surface of AuNPs. The chitosan film and AuNPs provided a friendly environment for enzyme molecules. HRP was firmly immobilized on AuNPs based on the strong interactions between them. These factors resulted in the excellent operational and storage stabilities of the prepared biosensor. HRP was also chemisorbed on colloidal which was self-assembled on the amino-functionalized electrode [59].\nPeriodate-oxidized GOD has been covalently immobilized on cystamine modified AuNPs based on Schiff base reaction between the aldehyde groups of periodate-oxidized GOD and amino groups of cystamine [51,53]. Schiff base reaction is easy to perform and widely used for covalent immobilization of enzymes. Using this immobilization method, aldehyde groups must be introduced on enzyme molecules. Periodate-oxidation is usually used to generate aldehyde groups to ensure the occurrence of Schiff base reactions with the amino-functionalized gold nanomaterials, which may be time-consuming and unfavorable for enzyme activity [60].\nThe carbodiimide coupling method, based on EDC/NHS coupling reaction, was also used for covalent immobilization of enzymes on carboxyl-functionalized gold nanomaterials [55,56]. For the functionalization of gold nanomaterials with carboxyl groups, the modifiers are the acids that contain both carboxyl and thiol groups. Based on the interactions between gold nanomaterials and thiol groups, carboxyl groups are introduced on the surface of gold nanomaterials, which will guarantee the occurrence of EDC/NHS coupling reaction. With this method, GOD was immobilized on AuNPs for the visual detection of glucose [55]. In this literature, synthesized by the citrate reduction method, AuNPs were first carboxyl-functionalized with 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid. After treating with EDC and NHS, the carboxyl groups on the surface of AuNPs and the amino groups of enzyme molecules will form amide bonds to covalently immobilize GOD.\nPhysical adsorption such as electrostatic, hydrophobic or hydrophilic adsorption has been applied in immobilizing enzymes on gold nanomaterials [49,58]. α-Amylase has been immobilized on gold nanorods (AuNRs) by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions for starch catalysis [58]. The AuNRs were prepared by sequential seed mediated growth method in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The surfaces of CTAB-capped AuNRs were positively charged, which would facilitate the electrostatic adsorption of the negatively charged enzyme molecules. Moreover, the cetyl residues from CTAB provided a hydrophobic environment for enzymes, which promoted the hydrophobic adsorption. The immobilized α-amylase showed enhanced storage and thermal stabilities together with extreme pH stability."

      "text" : "With high biocompatibility and large surface area, TiO2 nanomaterials have been used for enzymes immobilization in the applications of biosensor, study of catalytic activity, wastewater treatment, and so on. TiO2 nanomaterials can be synthesized by chemical vapor decomposition, hydrothermal, solvothermal, direct oxidation, and sol-gel methods. By physical adsorption [67], covalent attachment [68] or cross-linking method [69], enzymes have been immobilized on TiO2 nanomaterials.\nSucrose isomerase (SIase) was immobilized on ε-poly-L-lysine-functionalized mesoporous TiO2 (EPL-M-TiO2) by electrostatic adsorption, and the immobilized SIase was used for the kinetic and performance studies of enzyme [70]. The negatively charged M-TiO2 was modified with the polycation biological material EPL, obtaining positively charged EPL-M-TiO2. Thus, negatively charged SIase was electrostatically adsorbed on the positively charged EPL-M-TiO2, obtaining EPL-M-TiO2 immobilized SIase (SI-EPL-M-TiO2). After being functionalized with EPL, EPL-M-TiO2 showed enhanced enzyme loading capacity. SI-EPL-M-TiO2 showed decreased Km, implying increased affinity to substrate. This can be explained as follows: (i) EPL may induce SIase immobilizing on EPL-M-TiO2 directionally, (ii) EPL may make contact between the enzyme active site and the substrate more convenient, and (iii) the product can quickly leave the immobilized enzyme. SI-EPL-M-TiO2 showed enhanced pH, thermal and operational stability. Gao et al. immobilized lipase on the phenylaminopropyl trimethoxysilane functionalized mesoporous TiO2 based on hydrophobic interaction for the synthesis of cinnamyl acetate [71]. The optimum pH of the immobilized lipase was examined to be 7.0, which shifted by 0.5 unit to the acidic region compared with that of the free one. Meanwhile, the optimum temperature of the immobilized lipase was found to be 50 °C, which was similar to that of the free one. In addition, the immobilized lipase showed improved pH and thermal stabilities, and retained about 80 % of its initial catalytic activity after 10 successive runs. The cinnamyl acetate yield reached 96.9 % with 0.75 % of immobilized lipase loading, indicating improved catalytic activity.\nZhuang et al. compared the performances of mesoporous TiO2 microparticles immobilized adenosine deaminase (ADA) prepared with five different methods (Fig. 5) [72]. In the fifth method, TiO2 was first\nmodified with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) for the introduction of amino groups, and activated with GA based on Schiff base reaction. Then adenosine deaminase was covalently attached on the carrier. Finally, with GA, adenosine deaminase was further cross-linked on the carrier, obtaining the immobilized ADA. The immobilized ADA showed best operational stability compared with that prepared with other methods. This may be because GA coupling provides a stabilizing effect for the immobilized enzyme as the multipoint covalent attachment of enzyme onto the carrier. HRP was immobilized on the polydopamine coated TiO2 nanotube arrays for constructing a photoelectrochemical bio-sensing platform [68]. Dopamine was self-polymerized on the surface of TiO2 nanotube to generate the polydopamine coating and the catechol was oxidized to quinone, which facilitated the covalent attachment of enzyme on the surface of polydopamine-modified TiO2 nanotube by the Michael addition or Schiff base reaction."

      "heading" : "3.2.2. ZnO nanomaterials",
      "text" : "ZnO nanomaterials are promising carriers for enzymes immobilization due to their diverse properties such as high biocompatibility, nontoxicity, chemical stability, high specific surface area, and low cost. Solvothermal, hydrothermal, sol-gel, precipitation, physical vapor deposition, and chemical vapor deposition methods have been reported for the synthesis of ZnO nanomaterials. With high isoelectric point of about 9.5, nano-ZnO is positively charged in immobilization solution and suitable for the electrostatic adsorption of enzyme with low isoelectric point that is negatively charged in immobilization solution.\nAhmad et al. demonstrated a novel approach for constructing glucose biosensor based on a single ZnO nanofiber [15]. They prepared ZnO nanofibers through an electrospinning technique and fixed a single nanofiber on a gold electrode with the help of poly(vinyl alcohol). Finally, GOD was electrostatically adsorbed on the single nanofiber. The hydrophobic ZnO nanofiber provided a favorable environment for the immobilized GOD, which resulted in the excellent thermoresistance. Km is determined as 2.19 mM for the immobilized GOD, which is smaller than that of the free one, thus indicating a higher enzymatic activity and a higher affinity to glucose. The biosensor showed satisfactory storage stability, maintaining about 95 % of its original response to glucose after four months. The results suggested that a single ZnO nanofiber is a promising carrier for enzyme immobilization and can be used in various biological applications.\nAs a food additive approved by the Food and Drug Administration, nano-ZnO was used to immobilize α-amylase for catalyzing starch into maltose [73]. Based on the differences in isoelectric points, α-amylase was adsorbed on nano-ZnO via electrostatic interaction, which was also confirmed by FTIR characterization. Effects of pH, temperature and preincubation time on the activity of nano-ZnO immobilized α-amylase were investigated. The pH affected not only the enzyme activity, but also the enzyme-loading amount as α-amylase was immobilized on nano-ZnO by electrostatic interaction. Increase in the optimum temperature and activity stability was evident as the conformational integrity change of the enzyme structure after immobilization. The relative activity of immobilized α-amylase decreased slowly along with the increase of pre-incubation time while free α-amylase decreased rapidly, this is due to the limited mobility after immobilization, which prevents the sudden denaturation of the three-dimensional protein conformation. After immobilization, α-amylase showed increased Km and decreased Vmax, indicating decreased catalytic activity. The thermal stability study indicated that the immobilized α-amylase possessed a better resistance than the free one. Moreover, for thermal stability, the half-life of the biocatalyst is an evaluation criterion of the lifetime. The reusability and storage stability studies showed that immobilized αamylase exhibited about 80 % of its initial activity after 3 runs and about 70 % of its initial activity after a storage period of 30 days. Besides the naked ZnO nanomaterials, the polyethylene glycol- [74] or polyethyleneimine/GA-modified [75] ZnO nanomaterials were alsoFig. 5. Schematic illustration of mesoporous TiO2 immobilized ADA [72].\ndeveloped for enzyme immobilization. The results indicated that nanoZnO is a promising carrier for enzyme immobilization."

      "text" : "Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), a typical metal hydroxide nanomaterial with layered structure, have gained considerable attentions for their applications in catalysis [76], drug delivery [77], wastewater treatment [78] and so on. In recent decades, LDHs appeared as appropriate supports for enzymes immobilization due to their high surface area and biocompatibility [79]. Enzymes can be fixed by electrostatic attraction, ion exchange, van der Waals interaction or hydrogen bonding [80]. Using metal salts as the precursors, LDHs have been easily synthesized by coprecipitation, hydrothermal, or solvothermal methods. Sometimes, LDHs are delaminated into LDH nanosheets (LDHNSs) for utilization.\nPositively charged Ni-Al LDHNSs have been used as supports for the electrostatical adsorption of negatively charged HRP, and the HRP intercalated Ni-Al LDHNSs (HRP-Ni-Al LDHNSs) have been coated on a GCE for the fabrication of enzyme electrode [81]. The Ni-Al LDHs were first prepared by a coprecipitation method and delaminated into Ni-Al LDHNSs in formamide. The HRP-Ni-Al LDHNSs film was characterized by TEM and SEM, and the results showed that the film was uniform and porous with a layered structure and HRP was intercalated between LDHNSs as a monolayer. After being intercalated into Ni-Al LDHNSs, the HRP was proved to retain its native secondary structure which plays a critical role in enzyme activity and catalytic performance. Therefore, LDHNSs may be favorable for protecting the secondary structure of enzyme. The HRP-Ni-Al LDHNSs/GCE showed direct electrochemistry, good electrocatalytic activity and splendid analytical performance. The good stability can be attributed to the numerous hydroxyl groups, positive charges and rigid galleries of LDHNSs. The satisfactory properties of HRP-Ni-Al LDHNSs indicated that LDHNSs are promising matrices for enzymes immobilization and not limited to HRP. The LDHNSs immobilized enzymes may be applied in biocatalysis and biosensors.\nBesides binary LDHs, ternary LDHs, with three kinds of metal salts, were also prepared for enzymes immobilization. In order to enhance the antibacterial ability of lysozyme, three kinds of LDHs including two binary LDHs of MgAl-LDHs and ZnAl-LDHs and a ternary LDHs of ZnMgAl-LDHs have been prepared as the carriers [82]. The structures and morphologies of LDHs and lysozyme@LDHs have been characterized, and the antibacterial abilities of lysozyme@LDHs have been studied and compared with each other. The SEM images showed that ZnMgAl-LDHs exhibit homogeneous flower-like morphology with rough surface which can carry more lysozyme while the TEM images showed that lysozyme fixed more uniformly on the surface of ZnMgAlLDHs than those on MgAl-LDHs or ZnAl-LDHs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the structure of lysozyme@ZnMgAl-LDHs were unchanged and easier for lysozyme immobilizing on ternary LDHs. According to the FTIR spectra, lysozyme was located on the surface of LDHs and the interface concentration of lysozyme on ZnMgAl-LDHs was greater than those on MgAl-LDHs or ZnAl-LDHs. The lysozyme@LDHs exhibited exciting wound healing performance with no toxicity. In addition, the antibacterial study indicated that LDHs could enhance the antibacterial activity of lysozyme.\nLDHs are also coupled with other nanomaterials for the immobilization of enzymes. The precursors of MgAl-LDHs were successively deposited on the surface of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) layer-bylayer and grew into LDHs in situ. By the layer-by-layer deposition and in situ growth method, the flowerlike HNTs@LDHs were synthesized and used to immobilize lysozyme as depicted in Fig. 6 [80]. Lysozyme, labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, was proved to be immobilized on HNTs@LDHs based on fluorescent image. By analysis, the authors concluded that lysozyme was immobilized on HNTs@LDHs by hydrogen-bonding adsorption. The amount of lysozyme immobilized on HNTs@LDHs was examined and compared with that on individual\nHNTs and LDHs. The results showed that HNTs@LDHs carried more lysozyme, which is probably caused by the substantial docking sites provided by the high surface area of HNTs@LDHs. The HNTs@LDHs immobilized lysozyme was used in practical to resist Escherichia coli bacteria and the phenomenon indicated an enhanced antibacterial ability of the immobilized lysozyme. The results indicated that HNTs@ LDHs are promising supports for proteins immobilization, which would show potential applications in various biomedical fields."

An et al. gave a comprehensive review on the use of clay minerals as enzyme immobilization carriers [86]. Zhou and Hartmann reviewed the immobilization of enzymes on ordered mesoporous materials and their applications [89]. Lian et al. reviewed metal-organic frameworks as carriers for enzymes immobilization [90].\nSilica nanomaterials, typically including silica nanoparticles and mesoporous silica materials, could be used nakedly for the adsorption of enzymes [91,92]. Lysozyme molecules were adsorbed on silica nanoparticles with different sizes and their structures and activities were studied. The results indicated that the surface curvature of silica nanoparticle possibly influences the structure and function of the adsorbed lysozyme [91]. Besides, with substantial silanol groups, silica nanomaterials can be easily functionalized with silane blocking agent to introduce functional groups like amino, epoxy, carboxyl, and thiol groups for enzymes immobilization by non-covalent or covalent methods. Mesoporous silica nanomaterials have been prepared and modified with carboxyl or amino groups to immobilize enzymes by covalent attachment [93–95].\nChitosan or cellulose nanomaterials are usually coupled with other materials for enzymes immobilization [96,97]. Chitosan-modified CNTs [17], G [27], and magnetic nanoparticles [61] have been used for enzymes immobilization. For these nanocomposites, CNTs, G, magnetic nanoparticles etc. are used as supports for chitosan which serves as the functional supports for enzymes immobilization. However, this is contrary to the cellulose-based nanocomposites, in which cellulose nanofibers can be used as supports for other nanomaterials but not the functional supports to immobilize enzymes. Mahmoud et al. prepared a novel nanocomposite, namely cellulose nanocrystals supported AuNPs, for the immobilization of cyclodextrin glycosyl transferase [98]. For this nanocomposite, cellulose nanocrystals are used as supports for AuNPs which are further functionalized with thioctic acid to immobilize cyclodextrin glycosyl transferase."

      "text" : "In what field can immobilized enzymes be applied? This depends on the catalytic features of the enzymes. For instances,\ni The enzymes related to diseases have been applied in inhibitor screening.\nIn human bodies, enzymes paly vital roles in maintaining the normal body functions which may be affected by the over-expression of enzymes, thus causing diseases. For example, α-glucosidase, catalyzing the final step in the digestive process of carbohydrates, will result in high postprandial hyperglycemia, and this high postprandial hyperglycemia will worsen type II diabetes. Promisingly, the α-glucosidase inhibitor will suppress the postprandial hyperglycemia, thereby treating type II diabetes. In addition, the over-expression of tyrosinase will cause melanin pigmentation and further hyperpigmentation disorders. In our previous works, α-glucosidase was immobilized on\nmagnetic CS nanocomposites and tyrosinase was immobilized on aminated magnetic nanoparticles, and their inhibitors were screened from natural products using capillary electrophoresis [8,61]. Besides α-glucosidase and tyrosinase, diverse enzymes (thrombin [99], lipase [100], alanine aminotransferase [101], etc.) have been immobilized on nanomaterials for enzyme inhibitor screening.\ni The enzymes for organic pollutants degradation have been applied in wastewater treatment.\nWastewater treatment has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years due to the water crisis. Organic contaminants are always toxic and carcinogenic, so their complete degradation is necessary. Enzymatic degradation is an environmentally friendly method for the treatment of organic pollutants, and in order to improve their stabilities in harsh conditions and make full use of their catalytic activities, enzymes have been immobilized on nanomaterials for wastewater treatment. Various phenoloxidases, such as laccase [102], peroxidase [103] and tyrosinase [104] have been reported for the degradation of dyes and phenolic pollutants. TiO2 nanomaterials are considered as ideal supports for phenoloxidases immobilization because TiO2 immobilized phenoloxidases can combine the photocatalytic activities of TiO2 nanomaterials and the enzymatic catalytic activities of phenoloxidases to degrade dyes and phenolic pollutants [105,106]. In addition, lipase which hydrolyzes oil and fats into long chain fatty acid and glycerol is widely used for treating oily wastewater [107].\ni Based on the physical (electrical, optical) properties of the enzyme substrates or products, nanomaterial immobilized enzymes have been used to detect target compounds.\nThe blood glucose level is a clinical indicator of diabetes and the presence of glucose in urine is a signal of the worsening of diabetes. Therefore, glucose detection is of practical importance. Based on the decrease of the electrocatalytic response of the reduced form of dissolved oxygen, amperometric glucose biosensor was prepared for detecting glucose in human plasma sample [29]. Besides amperometric glucose biosensor, the optical glucose biosensor based on immobilized GOD has been fabricated to detect glucose in human urine sample [55]. In addition, the accurate determination of cholesterol is also necessary since it is an important biomarker relating to a number of clinical and heart disorders. Cholesterol is the substrate of cholesterol oxidase, and the biosensors based on immobilized cholesterol oxidase have been synthesized for the detection of cholesterol in serum samples [11,56]. Besides, the in situ monitoring of hazardous pollutant in wastewater is of vital importance. Based on this, the tyrosinase biosensor was established for in situ monitoring of pyrocatechol. With tyrosinase and oxygen, pyrocatechol was catalyzed to quinone which combined with 3-methyl-2-benothiazolinone hydrazone to form a brown product. By UV/Visible spectrophotometry, the brown product was detected. The tyrosinase biosensor was expected to be a potential device for the determination and quantification of phenols in the environment [7].\ni The enzymes related to production catalysis have been applied in\nindustrial production.\nBased on the catalytic properties, enzymes are expected to be used in a variety industrial applications. For instance, β-amylase, lipase, βgalactosidase, penicillin G amidase, etc., are respectively suitable for the industrial production of maltose, biodiesel, lactosucrose, semi-synthetic penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics, etc. However, their applications are often hindered by poor operational stability and reusability. After immobilization, enzymes have been reportedly used routinely in industrial production and reviewed in the literatures [108,109]. For example, maltose finds a wide range of applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries as it is mildly sweet and does not cause color formation. Therefore, the production of maltose is of vital importance. Chitosan beads immobilized β-amylases were filled in a horizontal rotary column reactor to produce maltose [110]. The molybdenum sulfide nanosheets immobilized β-amylase could be magnificently used for the production of maltose in food and pharmaceutical industries [111]."

      "heading" : "6. Conclusions and prospects",
      "text" : "To date, nanomaterials have been widely used for enzyme immobilization. Nanomaterial immobilized enzymes usually exhibit improved reusability and storage stability. Although the large-scale production of immobilized enzyme is a challenge, we cannot deny that immobilization is an enabling technology that makes biocatalyst practical and commercially available [112]. The immobilized enzymes may show lower affinity to substrates due to the conformational changes of enzyme molecules. The development of porous nanomaterials which can encapsulate enzyme molecules in the pores, may be a promising method. In addition, the separation (ultrafiltration or centrifugation) of nanomaterial immobilized enzymes is laborious and time-consuming, thus a hindrance to the application of nanomaterials in enzyme immobilization. Magnetic nanomaterials are considered more favorable due to their easy separation properties [113]. Therefore, the combination of the nanomaterials that have been summarized in this review with magnetic nanomaterials must be a favorable carrier for enzyme immobilization.\nOwing to their satisfactory properties, nanomaterial immobilized enzymes have been used in various fields. Their applications in inhibitor screening, wastewater treatment, target compound detection, and industrial production, have been reviewed in Section 5. The convenient recovery of the immobilized enzyme with favorable catalytic activity is a key issue for their practical applications. The fabrication of immobilized enzyme reactor, such as packed bed reactor, magnetically stabilized fluidized bed reactor, microchannel reactor, etc., should therefore be a potential method for the manufacture of green and sustainable chemicals [112].\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nAll authors contributed to this paper have been listed.

Due to their large specific surface areas, exceptional chemical, mechanical, thermal and cost effective characteristics, nanomaterials should be ideal carriers for the immobilization of enzymes. Enzymes immobilized on nano-carriers are more robust and stable, and can be recycled and reused. This review focuses on the nanomaterial immobilized enzymes and their applications. The introduction addresses the advantages of immobilized enzymes and the features of enzyme immobilization nanocarriers. The next section covers carbonaceous nanomaterials used in enzymes immobilization, with subsections on carbon nanotube, graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide. The third section treats metallic nanomaterials for enzymes immobilization, with subsections on metal (gold), metal oxide (titanium dioxide, zinc oxide) and metal hydroxide (layered double hydroxide) nanomaterials. Then, the next section summarizes the applications of nanomaterial immobilized enzymes. A concluding section discusses the challenges and prospects of nanomaterial immobilized enzymes.",
