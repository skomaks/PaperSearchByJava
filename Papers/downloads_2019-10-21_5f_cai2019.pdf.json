      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Nanostructured materials are widely applied in clean energy related catalytic reactions including oxidation and decomposition of small molecules (such as H2O, CO2, O2 etc.) [1–6]. In general, the intrinsic activity of catalyst in a specific catalytic reaction critically depends on its material properties [5], including shape, size, composition and internal structure [7–11], which, in principle, are often not independent from each other. As a result, in most situations concomitant variation of these parameters under operation conditions may lead to uncontrolled influence on catalytic behavior, thus performance decay of the catalysts is quite common [12–14]. In addition, during realistic electrochemical process, reaction-driven structural reconstruction is also common for nanostructured catalysts, which often leads to sluggish surface that deteriorates further reaction. Both cases are major barriers of limiting the potential of current catalysts [15]. Once a catalyst has been introduced into an operando condition, where the adsorption of reaction species, etching agents [3] and dissolution of active surface components are able to modify the surface microstructures [16], atomic structures and composition [6]. Reconstructed catalysts possess stable structural features and have attracted researchers to utilize the natural materials\nevolution (from as-prepared materials) as a new strategy for design of desired catalysts [17,18]. It is critically important for the proof of concept in a reaction-driven formation of unique nanostructures.\nThe catalysts with high efficiency are usually accompanied by structural instability. Alternative catalyst design by reaction-driven catalyst evolution is developed to generate newly-formed stable nanostructures from pristine structure. The preserved original strong coordinated state [19–27], highly structural and surface energy [28] are expected to enable the reformed nanostructure exhibiting enhanced catalytic efficiency [29]. However, the reconstructed catalysts may suffer compositional and structural variations [30,31]. For example, Li et al. observed the Pt and Pd layer segregation on nanoporous Au during the oxygen reduction reaction in acid solution [32]. Generally, the most stable material structure favors an exothermic process and often exhibits the lowest energy state. The exothermic structural evolution process was observed by Gilroy et al. who found a structural evolution of Pd from metastable concave icosahedron to a more stable single crystal sphere [33]. Very recently, dealloying-driven surface reconstruction in reaction condition is reported to results in a NiAu@Au core-shell nanostructure with improved catalytic activity [34]. Therefore, we hypothesize that a nanostructure, resulted from reaction-\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.118103 Received 27 March 2019; Received in revised form 15 August 2019; Accepted 18 August 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author. ⁎⁎ Corresponding author at: School of Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610054, China.

As-prepared NiAu nanospindles (NSs) are used as precatalyst, which is then introduced into ammonia borane (AB) hydrolysis condition to initiate the process [35–45]. The structural details have been carefully studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The controllable structural evolution in reaction condition is shown to be highly sensitive to the surface species, interface state, and surrounded mediums. The catalytic performance of NiAu-based nanomaterials is tuned by controlling the surface and interface state. Moreover, through combined x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density function theory (DFT) calculation, we demonstrate that electronic state determine the charge transport efficiency of NiAu-based nanomaterials. Our work demonstrates that catalyst design by considering reactiondriven reconstruction in operando conditions may offer as novel and general strategy for developing high-performance catalysts."

      "heading" : "2. Structural characterizations",
      "text" : "Bimetallic NiAu NSs are synthesized via wet chemical methods in oleylamine (OAm) according to previous work with modification [26]. The morphologies of as-prepared monodispersed NSs are measured by high angle annular dark field (HAADF) modes (Fig. 1a), in which bright and dark contrast correspond to Au and Ni atoms, respectively. High resolution HAADF image in Fig. 1b clearly demonstrates that NiAu NSs are not uniform in composition and Au atoms mainly concentrate as a small cluster attached to one end of the NiAu particle (inset in Fig. 1b). Interestingly, some Au atoms are scattered on Ni sites as single atoms. Those marked Au single atoms (red circles in Fig. 1b) are anchored on Ni along Ni (111). Powders X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern confirms the face-center cubic (FCC) feature of NiAu (Fig. S1) [46,47]. For comparison, monodispersed Ni nanoparticles and Au nanoparticles are\nsynthesized, as shown in Fig. S2. We then demonstrate post-annealing in Ar atmosphere is an effective approach to modify the surface and interface structures of as-prepared NiAu-based NSs, to exhibit additional four typical nanostructures, as summarized in Fig. 1c–f. For clarification, we list the sample structures, prepare conditions, name abbreviations in Table S1. Specifically, at 623 K the as-prepared NiAu NSs (sample A) adapts a reconstruction to transform into a typical NiAu@Au@NiO multilayer core-shell nanostructures (CSNs) (sample B, Fig. 1c), consisting of AuNi core, Au interlayer, and NiO shell. At 673 K, recrystallization continues which lead to a recrystallized NiAu NSs (sample C, Fig. 1d). At higher temperature of 773 K molten Au diffuses on Ni surface, resulting in a reconstruction into to Ni@Au CSNs (sample D, Fig. 1e) and finally at 973 K, NiAu alloy (sample E, Fig. 1f) is formed as demonstrated by homogeneously distributed Ni and Au. Among these Ni-Au-based nanoparticles, low-temperature processed sample B (annealed at 623 K) shows the most interesting multilayer CSNs with oxide shells, as clearly demonstrated by the NiO lattice image in Fig. 1c. Previous experiments have shown that when combined with noble metals, the catalytic performance (AB hydrolysis) of transitional metal can be enhanced [20,23–27], therefore, the disordered Au layer between NiAu-core and NiO-shell in this work is expected to promote the chemical activity of CSNs, benefiting from the large area of contact interface in NiAu@Au@ NiO multilayer CSNs (as demonstrated in next section). On the other hand, higher annealing temperature (> 623 K) cannot lead to the formation of oxide shells for samples C, D, and E (see Fig. 1d–f)."

      "heading" : "3. Dehydrogenation characterization",
      "text" : "Having thoroughly studied the structure of various NiAu-based materials, we use those materials as catalysts for AB hydrolysis, as shown in Figs. 2 and S3. Following reported procedures [48], tiny sodium borohydride (SB) in reaction condition is used to promote the dehydrogenation rate. The hydrolysis reaction is carried out at 298 K in air (details can be found in experimental section). Fig. 2a demonstrates that compared with pure Ni and Au nanoparticles, the as-prepared NiAu\nNSs (sample A) show better dehydrogenation activity, due to accelerated charge transfer from Au to Ni [24]. These results reveal that Au plays important role in determining the dehydrogenation activity for NiAu-based materials. Further experiments indicate that stoichiometry also affect the dehydrogenation activity and the samples with Ni:Au ratio of 10:1 exhibits the highest catalytic activity (Fig. S3b). As compared in Fig. 2b, hydrogen generation rate of those samples is in the following sequence, sample B > sample C > sample A > sample D > sample E. Fig. 2c summarizes the specific mass activity (MA) of series samples with different annealing temperature. MA of sample B is determined to be 132.4 mL·g−1 min−1, which is greatly enhanced compared with sample A (4.4-fold), and sample C (3.3-fold), sample D (6.5-fold), and sample E (13.0-fold), respectively. Meanwhile, catalysts with good activity stability in reaction conditions is also desirable for practical applications. Herein, we have also examined the stability of catalysts, as shown in Figs. 2d and S3a. Sample B shows a stability up high to 240 cycles with 75% efficiency retention (counted in MA). In comparison, the sample A exhibits poor stability with only 15 cycles (Fig. S3a). Thus, this section demonstrates that structural modification can impact the surface chemistry of active site thus leading to performance enhancement for hydrogen generation."

      "heading" : "4. Reaction-driven structure reconstruction",
      "text" : "We studied the structure reconstruction in Fig. 3a using ex-situ HAADF, which clearly demonstrates the catalysts transform from NiAu@Au@NiO multilayer CSNs (sample B) to mesoporous yolk-shell nanostructures (YSNs) (sample G) after 15 cycles of reaction. The newborn YSNs consist of bright Au small yolks, which are surrounded by dark hallow shells of polycrystalline NiO with interspace of 2˜4 nm gap. High-resolution TEM image in Fig. 3b demonstrates polycrystalline feature of the shell, which is composed of NiO nanocrystals with 2˜4 nm in diameter. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) element mapping in Fig. 3c directly confirms the Au yolk and NiO shell. In addition, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and ex-situ XRD (Fig. S5) also confirm that the metallic Ni atoms in original multilayer CSNs change into polycrystalline NiO after 15 cycles.\nIn comparison to the multilayer CSNs to YSNs transformation (e.g. sample B → sample G), we also identify another reconstruction process. For example, we find under similar reaction-driven reconstruction (15 cycles), the as-prepare NiAu NSs (sample A) transform to Au@NiO CSNs with single crystal shell (sample F), as illustrated in Fig. 3e, illustrating a sample A→ sample F transition. Fig. S6 further shows that the surface of sample F is actually made of amorphous instead of crystalline oxide layer. XPS pattern confirms the existence of two oxygen-contained species (Fig. S7), corresponding to the evident amorphous and crystalline layer in Fig. S6b.\nBased on these structural analyses, it is clear that the both as-prepared sample A and 623 K-annealed sample B show distinct structure and morphology evolution/reconstruction, leading to Au-NiO coreshell/yolk-shell, respectively, during reaction (15 cycles). The present results suggest that oxidization of Ni during chemical reaction triggers the formation of mesoporous polycrystalline shell surrounded Au yolk. The reformed YSNs can be attributed by the NiO regrowth and Au aggregation in reaction condition. During this process, the diffusion rate of metallic Ni atoms (from NiAu core to shell) is higher than that of O atoms (from outside to inside), known as Kirkendall effect [16,24]. Therefore, the NiO crystals grow preferentially and form a NiO shell on multilayer CSNs. Besides, Au atom is immiscible in NiO thus is aggregated as yolk during reaction.\nTo understand the effect of structural evolution on the reaction stability, we study the YSNs (sample G) with longer cycles. We show in Fig. S4 the HAADF image for sample G after 240 cycles. It is seen that the typical YSNs is generally preserved, demonstrating a high morphology stability of sample G. Previous works demonstrate that efficient catalysts usually suffer structural corrosion in operando condition [49], leading to catalysts deactivation [24]. However, the present results show the high catalytic activity of multilayer CSNs (sample B) is not only uncompromised by structural reconstruction, which may, on the other hand, even helps to prolong the stability (with 16-fold enhancement, as discussed in next section in Fig. 4a)."

      "heading" : "5. Reconstruction process control",
      "text" : "To further clarify the role of NiO formation in reconstruction of AuNi-based materials in reaction conditions, we conduct experiments to control the Ni diffusion. Ex-situ STEM image and EDS mapping demonstrate that after similar 15 cycles of electrochemical reactions, both 773 K-annealed sample D (Fig. S8) and 973 K-annealed sample E (Fig. S9) preserve their respective original nanostructure features with unoxidized Ni. Combining TEM results from Figs. S8 and S9 and schematics in Fig. 3e, it is reasonable to conclude that controlling the diffusion pathway of Ni/NiO could effectively influence the reconstruction process of Au-NiO for various samples.\nTo confirm this, we use chemically inactive polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as stabilizer to confine the spatial diffusion of surface Ni atoms. We choose the representative 623 K-annealed NiAu@Au@NiO multilayer CSNs (sample B) to demonstrate this process. In contrast to the previously formed Au@NiO YSNs without PVP (sample B → sample G transition), the PVP inclusion tends to reconstruct a stable Au-Ni/NiO NSs (sample H, Fig. S10) after 20 cycles of AB hydrolysis, as sample B→ sample H transition. Detailed structural TEM characterization can be found in Fig. S10a–d. This different reconstruction is attributed to the\nvolume confinement of covered PVP adsorbates and Au atom segregation. In this process (20 cycles), due to the spatial confinement of surface PVP adsorbates, Ni diffusion from inner core to surface is limited, resulting less Ni oxidization for solid NiO formation. Therefore, some Ni atoms remain unoxidized after 20 cycles leading to a mix of solid NiO/ Ni partial in the obtained nanostructure. On the other hand, due to the immiscible nature of Au in oxide NiO matrix, Au atoms tend to segregate away from center of the nanostructure, as demonstrated in Fig. S10a–c. Accordingly, the Au segregation results in the fact that the final morphology of sample H is similar to sample A (see Figs. 1b and 3 e).\nUp to here now we have demonstrated a controlled surfaces and interfaces modification leading to a variety of typical nanostructure patterns for Ni-Au based system. For clarification, we further summarize the structural relationships and processing parameters into Fig. 3e. Obviously, heat treatment can effectively modify the nanostructures of NiAu-based materials by triggering transport of Au or Ni atoms. The reaction-driven reconstruction of NiAu-based materials during hydrogen generation reaction is also sensitive to the modified surface and interface state, leading to the formation of Au@NiO CSNs (sample F) and Au@NiO YSNs (sample G). These two nanostructures show different performance in catalytic reaction (Figs. 2b, d and S3a).\nBesides, the controlled atoms diffusion pathway of Ni and Au (PVPstabilized multilayer CSNs sample B) leads to the formation of Au-Ni/ NiO NSs (sample H), which shows poor catalytic stability (20 cycles) comparing to Au@NiO YSNs (sample G, 240 cycles).\nIn those reconstructed Au-NiO-based materials, the Ni oxidation is the major trigger of reaction-driven reconstruction. Yet, a very interesting question is that both AB and SB hydrolysis are very strong reducing reaction environment (as demonstrated by electrochemical characterization of sample B through AB and SB hydrolysis reactions in Fig. S11), then what is the driven force for the oxidization of Ni to form NiO? To clarify this, we design extra experiment to carrier out the AB hydrolysis in Ar-saturated conditions to exclude the pre-existing oxygen molecular dissolved in the solution. The HAADF image (Fig. S12a) demonstrates that even without oxygen in solution, sample B still transforms into Au@NiO YSNs. XRD pattern (Fig. S12b) confirms the formation of NiO after 20 cycles. These structure features are very similar to the Au@NiO YSNs (sample G) obtained without Ar-saturation, suggesting molecular oxygen in solution is not the source of Ni oxidization. One possible source of oxidization is the water molecular. To verify this, we perform gas chromatography (GC) analysis for the gas products and detect distinctive contribution of oxygen in addition to the hydrogen (Fig. S13), suggesting oxygen evolution from water splitting during the catalytic hydrolysis process. Therefore, water molecular plays important role in supplying oxygen for Ni oxidization in such a highly reduction AB dehydrogenation process and trigger the various structural reconstruction process.\nWe demonstrate that the catalytic performance can be promoted by controlling the structural evolution in operando conditions (Fig. 4). Fig. 4a indicates Au@NiO YSNs (sample G) exhibit the highest stability\nup to 240 cycles comparing to the Au@NiO CSNs (sample F, ca. 16-fold) and Au-Ni/NiO NSs (sample H, ca. 8-fold), demonstrating the advantage of yolk-shell structure in optimizing the interface properties and stability of catalysts. Fig. 4b summarizes the relative MA for various structures. By comparing sample A and sample H, we conclude that the modified Au-NiO sites are more active for AB hydrolysis than Au-Ni sites. Besides, sample G and sample H possess high catalytic activity, which may benefit from the high Au-NiO sites exposure ratio. Moreover, comparison of sample F (Au@NiO CSNs with single crystal shell) and sample G (polycrystalline shell) reveals that the high catalytic activity may also attributed by the mesoporous and polycrystalline structure, which enable sufficient contact of Au-NiO sites and AB molecules. Sample B possesses abundant Ni-Au-NiO contact sites at sublayer, ensuring high exposure ratio of Au-NiO sites. Therefore, the high catalytic activity of sample G can be attributed to the high exposure ratio of Au-NiO sites."

      "heading" : "6. Charge transport state on NiAu-based nanomaterials",
      "text" : "The newborn Au and NiO hybrids play important roles in promoting catalytic activity. The Ni and NiO nanoparticles show similar catalytic activity for AB hydrolysis (Fig. S14), thus the higher catalytic performance of NiAu nanostructure may come from the contribution of Au. Therefore, verifying the electronic states of Au-Ni and Au-NiO are important to understand the mechanism and origin of catalytic behavior of NiAu-based materials for AB hydrolysis. XPS is used to characterize the surface chemistry of NiAu@Au@NiO multilayer CSNs (sample B) and Au@NiO YSNs (sample G). Survey spectrum of YSNs and multilayer CSNs (Fig. 5a) show generally similar compositions. High-resolution Ni\n2p core-level spectra in Fig. 5b show two peaks located at 854.9 eV and 872.8 eV, respectively, corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 of metallic Ni [23]. The Nix+ with higher oxidization state shows ca. 1.2 eV higher binding energy than metallic Ni, consistent with previous observations [50]. Peaks located at around 83.5 eV and 87.5 eV (Fig. 5c) are consistent with Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 [24], respectively. The 0.17 eV blue shift in Au@NiO YSNs demonstrates the strong interaction between Au and Ni. As electronegativity of Ni (1.91) is smaller than that of Au (2.54), hence Au-Ni interaction leads to preferential electron accumulation around Au atoms, highly promoting the charge transport efficiency. The electronegativity difference also explains the red shift of Ni 2p3/2. In addition, O 1s core-level peaks in Fig. 5d also confirm the NiO formation.\nFirst-principle based DFT calculations are further carried out to examine the charge transport on localized area and charge distributions of Au and Ni components for NiAu and Au-NiO nanostructures as shown in Fig. 6. The Bader charge analysis has been applied on the most stable configurations (Au atoms anchor on adjacent FCC sites), i.e. 3Au-Ni (111) (3×3) for NiAu NSs and 3Au-NiO(111) (3× 3) for Au@NiO YSNs, respectively. We then calculate the charge transfer energy for both type of interfaces, and the obtained values are -0.20 eV and -0.375 eV for Au-Ni and Au-NiO interfaces, respectively. The negative values confirm charge transfer existing in both types of Au-Ni and AuNiO interfaces. The fact that Au-NiO interface shows more negative value than that of Au-Ni interface, suggesting the former is more stable. This is also consistent with the observed binding energy shift for both Au 4f and Ni 2p core-level spectra. Thus, both theory and experiment results indicate that Au@NiO YSNs show better charge transfer efficiency. Therefore, combining TEM, XPS and electrochemical characterizations, we demonstrate controllable reaction-driven reconstruction leads to desired nanostructure with enhanced catalytic performance. Particularly, these discoveries show that the point-contacting interfaces of Au-NiO exhibit higher catalytic activity comparing\nto the abundant Ni-Au interfaces (reconstructed Ni@Au CSNs and NiAu alloy), disclosing that highest catalytic activity of NiAu@Au@NiO multilayer CSNs and Au@NiO YSNs originates from the accelerated charge transport coefficient between Au-NiO interfaces."

This modification leads a controllable reaction-driven structural reconstruction process in operando condition during catalytic cycles. Advanced TEM characterization reveals a variety of representative nanostructures which are obtained by controlled interface and surface modification through annealing and catalytic reaction process, including representative core-shell and yolk-shell nanostructures (CSNs and YSNs). The reconstruction of NiAu can effectively modify the charge states between Ni and Au. Therefore, these controlled surface and interface conditions are shown to be critical to affect the catalytic activity and stability for NiAu-based catalysts and reconstructed Au@NiO based YSNs are highly efficient for AB degradation and dehydrogenation. These results demonstrate that catalyst design by considering desirablecontrol of the surface and interface properties of catalysts in operando conditions may offer as novel and general strategy for developing highperformance catalysts.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare."

    "abstractText" : "Catalytic activity of nanostructured materials are closely tied with structure, thus developing nanomaterials with processable structures has arisen as a new strategy for designing high active catalysts. In this work we report the realization of controllable structural evolution of NiAu-based materials in operando conditions. The structure evolution of NiAu catalysts at atomic scale has been characterized by ex-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. The catalytic activity for ammonia borane hydrolysis has promoted for 4.4-fold after adapting structural evolution. The catalytic stability has increased for 16-fold of maintaining 75% activity. This work provides inspiration for emerging catalysts design based on bimetallic nanoparticles with both high performance and durability in a catalytic reaction system.",
