Among the methods of CO2 reduction, the electrochemical method has been widely used due to its mild reaction condition and high reaction efficiency. In the electrochemical reduction system, the CO2 electrocatalyst is the most important part. Although many CO2 electrocatalysts have been developed, efficient catalysts with high activity, selectivity and stability are still lacking. Copper sulfide compound, as a low-toxicity and emerging material, has broad prospects in the field of CO2 reduction due to its unique structural and electrochemical properties. Much progress has been achieved with copper sulfide nanocrystalline and the field is rapidly developing. This paper summarizes the preparation, recent progress in development, and factors affecting the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance with copper sulfide compound as a catalyst. Prospects for future development are also outlined, with the aim of using copper sulfide compound as a highly active and stable electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction.\n92\n93 94\n95 96 97 98 99\n100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110"

      "text" : "Since the industrial revolution, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas have been massively mined and utilized. As non-renewable energy resources, fossil fuels have two fatal flaws. First, the limited reserves cannot meet the growing energy demand, leading to a serious energy crisis. Second, the use of fossil fuels for energy production emits a large amount of CO2 into the atmosphere, causing global environmental problems [1,2], such as global warming, sea level rise, land desertification, etc. For sustainable development, it is extremely urgent to reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Scientists have made many efforts to achieve this goal. Starting from the source, clean and CO2–free renewable energy has been developed to replace the use of fossil fuels for energy production [3–14]. Converting CO2 into value added carbon fuels, including CO, HCOOH/HCOO , CH2O, CH4, CH3OH, H2C2O4/HC2O4 , C2H4, CH3CH2OH and other products through chemical\nmmiyauchi@ceram.titech.ac.jp (\nion and hosting by Elsevier B.V. o\nnt advances in the utilization .nanoms.2019.10.006\nmethods has been utilized to recycle the CO2 [15–20]. Normally, the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can be achieved by photochemical reduction [21–24], electrochemical reduction [25–27], biochemical reduction [28–30] and so on. Electrocatalytic CO2RR has attracted much attention because of its virtues of process controllability, mild reaction environment and high reaction efficiency [31–34]. In addition, renewable energies such as solar energy and wind energy can be used as power sources to conduct electrocatalytic CO2RR, enabling storage and redistribution of the renewable energy, as shown in Fig. 1 [35–37]. Therefore, electro-catalytic CO2RR has become an important research field with a wide application prospect.\nAlthough much progress has been made, some problems still exist with the practical application of electrocatalytic CO2RR, including [32, 33] (1) high reduction potential for CO2 electrochemical conversion; (2) slow kinetics of CO2 electroreduction; (3) low energy conversion efficiency; (4) poor catalytic selectivity; (5) insufficient stability; and (6)\nM.

The key to solving these problems is to develop high performance electrocatalysts with good activity, selectivity, and stability.\nThe electrocatalysts for CO2RR can be classified into two categories: metal catalysts and non-metal catalysts. The non-metal catalysts are mainly carbon-based materials [38–40]. The metal catalysts include metal elements and their associated compounds such as metals, metal alloys, metal oxides and metal complexes [15,32,41–48]. Different metal catalysts result in differences in the activity and selectivity of the CO2RR because of the differences in the adsorption strength of the intermediates. According to the selectivity for final products, the metal catalysts can be further classified into four categories [49–52]: (1) Cd, Hg, Sn, In, Bi, Pb, Pd, etc., which easily produce HCOO intermediate, and form formate as the main product; (2) Au, Ag, Zn, etc., because of the weak CO adsorption capacity, resulting in CO as main reduction product; (3) Ni, Fe, Si, V, Pt, etc., mainly to produce H2 due to the low hydrogen evolution potential; (4) Cu, under different conditions, can produce 16 different carbon-containing compounds, including various multi–carbon products.\nStudies have shown that Cu is the only catalyst that can reduce CO2 to high energy density multi–carbon products and thus has attracted much attention. However, the key step in the C–C bond formation needed for the multi–carbon products induces an extra barrier in the reaction, which causes low activity and poor selectivity. To solve this problem, scientists have conducted much research on ways to improve catalyst performance, the mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2RR, and in other directions. It has been found that the activity and selectivity of Cu catalysts in the reaction process are affected by multiple factors. Hori et al. [53,54] found that different crystal surfaces of Cu could yield different reduction products. He found that the main product of the Cu (111) surface is methane, and the Cu (100) surface is selective for C2 products like ethylene and ethanol. Rcskc et al. [55] found that the catalytic activity and product selectivity of nanoscale Cu particles were much higher than that of bulk metal Cu. Chen et al. [56] investigated the performance of the single atom Cu catalyst, and found it has better performance than other investigated materials. The catalyst morphology also plays an important role. Chorkendorff et al. [57] discovered that Cu electrodes with different surface roughness have different product selectivity for CO2RR. They reported a Cu nanoparticle coated electrode has better selectivity for hydrocarbons than other uncoated electrodes. Also, different morphologies of Cu–based catalysts have been synthesized and studied for electrocatalytic CO2RR such as nanowires [58,59], films [60], microcubes [61], core–shell [62–64], etc. The research results showed that the catalytic performance can be remarkably improved through changing the catalysts’ structure and morphology.\nIn recent years, more and more research has been reported on Cu metal compounds. By introducing other elements into Cu metal electrodes, the resultant different bonding modes with Cu and multiple binding sites for intermediate species will have a great influence on the performance of the catalyst [15,18,65–73]. Sulfur belongs to theⅥ group element and the sulfur compound has excellent optical and electrical\nproperties [74–77]. The bonding form of the S atom is various. For example, S has small electronegativity, easily reacts with the metal element to form an ionic compound, and has the capacity to bond with itself to form a chain-shaped polysulfide ion Sn2 . Due to the various bonding modes of S atoms, the structure of sulfides tends to be diversified and complicated, which means that S is an attractive candidate as a modifier for electrocatalysts. Copper sulfide compounds with different S content, combination and element composition have various phase states, morphologies and crystal structures. It has been widely used in catalysis [19], optoelectronic equipment [78,79], photovoltaic panels [80–82], sensors [83], biomedicine [84,85] and other fields. In the field of electrocatalytic CO2RR, the S atom can effectively suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and significantly influence the absorption and desorption strength of CO2 reduction intermediates [86,87]. For that reason, copper sulfide compounds have promising prospects for improving catalytic activity and product selectivity.\nAt present, there is much research about copper sulfide compound electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Most showed good selectivity and high activity. This paper reviews the recent progress in the utilization of copper sulfide compounds in the field of electrochemical CO2RR. We first introduce several methods for preparing different nanostructures of copper sulfide compounds. Then, we summarize recent reports on the utilization of copper sulfide compounds as electrocatalysts to reduce CO2. We analyze the morphology, size, composition, substrate and other factors which affect the catalytic performance and the reaction mechanism in the electrochemical CO2RR process. Finally, we list the existing problems and make proposals for future research and development.\n2. Preparation methods of copper sulfide compound\nBinary copper sulfide compound, also known as Cu2-xS, is a direct band gap semiconductor nano-material with excellent absorption of visible light, which has a variety of stoichiometric compositions, multiple nanocrystal morphologies, complex crystal structures and valence states [88–91]. Research shows that several phases of Cu2-xS nanocrystal exist, with the value of x from 0 to 1, such as Cu2S (chalcocite), Cu1⋅97S (djurleite), Cu1⋅80S (digenite), Cu1⋅40S (spionkopite), CuS (covelline), etc. [92,93]. Cu2-xS is a typical p-type semiconductor material, which has a large number of Cu holes in the crystal lattice. The bond length of the Cu–Cu bond and the Cu–S bond in Cu2-xS is close to the bond length of the Cu–Cu bond in the metal Cu, and thus exhibits excellent conductivity [94,95]. In particular, CuS has a peculiar crystal structure in which one-third of the copper atoms are coordinated with three sulfur atoms, and the remaining two-thirds of the copper atoms are surrounded by four sulfur atoms to form a tetrahedral structure which exhibits a special superconducting property at 1.63 K [96].\nTernary copper sulfide compound is formed by introducing other metal elements (such as Na, In, Ag, K, etc.) on the basis of Cu2-xS. The Cu atom in the ternary copper sulfide compound generally exists in the form of þ1 valence or in a mixed valence state. The various coordination\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66\n67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 modes make the material have various crystal structures such as a onedimensional chain structure, layer structure, octahedral structure, etc. With the introduction of different elements, the physicochemical properties are different, so it has a very broad application prospect. The synthesis of copper sulfide compounds has been studied for decades. By controlling the reaction temperature, time and environment, copper sulfide nanocrystals with different morphologies and structures can be obtained. The special surface topography endows the material with new and outstanding characteristics, leading to broader application prospects in several fields.\n77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99\n100 101 102"

After high temperature and pressure through external heating, the insoluble matter at normal temperature and pressure will be dissolved and recrystallized to form the target product. The products synthesized by the solvothermal method have the characteristics of high dispersion, small size, uniformity, controllable morphology and low cost.\nZheng et al. [97] reported that high dispersion CuS microspheres were synthesized by the solvothermal method, as shown in Fig. 2. Using [Bmim]2Cu2Cl6 as the precursor and thiourea (TU) as the sulfur source, a series of CuS microspheres with diameters of 2.5–4 μm assembled by nanosheets with thicknesses of 10–15 nm were obtained. Hu et al. [98] synthesized special flower-like CuS nanocrystals using chloride (CuCl2⋅2H2O) as the precursor, TU as the sulfur source and ethylene glycol (C2H6O2) as the solvent. Well-defined products were obtained with good control over size and shape by template and other reaction conditions.\nSaranya et al. [99] found that the final product's morphology directly correlated with the sulfur source under the same reaction condition. For example, they prepared self-assembled CuS nanostructures with TU as the sulfur source and different CuS nanostructures with thioacetamide (TAA) as the sulfur source under the same reaction temperature and time.\n103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112"

The hot injection method separates the nucleation and growth process into two different stages by controlling the reaction temperature, avoiding secondary nucleation and ensuring monodisperse and high-quality nanocrystals.\nLi et al. [101] adopted the hot injection method to prepare high-quality CuS nanocrystals in an oleic acid/liquid paraffin system using copper oxide (CuO) and elemental S as the precursors without inert gas. At first, they mixed CuO, oleic acid and liquid paraffin as precursor A, and then they mixed elemental S and liquid paraffin as precursor B. Then, precursor A and precursor B were stirred and heated to 180 C and 120 C, respectively, until homogeneous solutions were obtained. Finally, precursor B was swiftly injected into precursor A, and CuS nanoparticles were obtained.\nBy controlling the reaction temperature, Olesiak et al. [102] synthesized Cu2S nanorods and accomplished effective regulation of the nanorods’ length. Tao et al. [103] introduced halogen ions (Cl , Br , I ) to regulate the growth of the crystal surface to synthesize special triangular nano-prism CuS by the hot injection method."

      "text" : "The template method is divided into the soft template method and the hard template method. The soft template is formed by the aggregation of surfactant molecules, and the hard template is a rigid template maintained by covalent bond. The template method can effectively regulate the size, morphology, structure, arrangement and other factors of nanomaterials through its structure orientation or spatial limiting action. Due to its highly adjustable morphology and structure, this method is widely used by researchers to prepare nanomaterials with special structures such as nanotubes, nanowires and hollow spheres.\nWu et al. [104] used Cu2O nanospheres as templates to prepare CuS hollow nanospheres through carrying out a sulfurization reaction at 40 C. The formation mechanism of a hollow sphere is proposed and illustrated in Fig. 4a. At first, S2 released by STS reacted with Cu2O on the surface of the sphere to produce CuS, forming the core-shell structure covered with CuS on the surface of the Cu2O. Because the diffusion velocity of Cu2þ is faster than that of S2 in the CuS shell, the production of CuS on the outside of the shell is faster than that on the inside of the shell. As a result, the Cu2O/CuS core-shell structures completely transform to CuS hollow nanospheres (Fig. 4b). Similarly, Sun et al.

Applying copper sulfide compounds to electrochemical CO2RR\nElectrochemical reduction of CO2 belongs to the typical heterogeneous catalytic reaction. The heterogeneous catalytic reaction process can be summarized into three steps, which are: (1) gaseous or liquid reactants adsorbed on the surface of the solid catalyst; (2) reactants like CO2 turn into different intermediate products through the gain or loss of electrons, and reduce to the final reduction products; and (3) desorption of the final reduction products. In the CO2 reduction process, the catalyst's type, size, structure, even different substrates have a great influence on the above three-step reaction process. In the past, copper sulfide compound was commonly used in other catalytic fields such as oxygen evolution reaction (OER), HER, photocatalytic reaction, etc. [19,72,99, 109–117]. In recent years, copper sulfide compound has been continuously selected as a catalyst for electrochemical reduction, especially for CO2 reduction."

      "text" : "Regulating the morphology and structure of the catalyst has always\nbeen one of the hot strategies to optimize the catalytic performance, and has achieved many excellent research results. By regulating the morphology and structure, the physicochemical properties of the promoter can be changed, thereby changing the catalytic activity and selectivity. For example, it can effectively improve the active area of the catalyst [118,119], increase active sites for specific needs [120]#, generate novel and interesting physical phenomena [25,121], change the adsorption strength of the catalyst on the electrolyte or CO2 [19,122], etc.\nFor the copper sulfide compound, the catalyst morphology and structure affecting the performance have been the focus in the\nelectrochemical CO2RR field. Zhu et al. [123] reported the first work on the electrochemical reduction of CO2 using a Cu2S catalyst in an H-cell, as shown in Fig. 7a. After anodization and heat treatment of a copper foam electrode, a Cu2S nanoarray (Fig. 7b) was obtained on the copper foam by electro-deposition in a Na2S aqueous solution. The nanoarray had a nanosheet morphology and a thickness which could be easily controlled by varying the deposition potential and time. The obtained Cu2S/Cu electrode was very efficient in reducing CO2 to HCOOH. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of formic acid production and the reduction current density could reach 85% and 5.3mA/cm2, respectively, at the potential of 2.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl . The selectivity of the Cu2S/Cu electrode to formic acid is much higher than that of the pure Cu electrode without S-doped modification (Fig. 7c). This high selectivity toward formate can be attributed to the surface morphologies with more Cu2S-derived Cu0 catalyst. By changing the morphology and structure, the selectivity to the final\nproduct can be shifted to other single-carbon products. Shao et al. [124] reported a research on the synthesis of hollow CuS (h-CuS) microcubes (Fig. 8a) through the galvanic replacement reaction of the Cu2O microcubes (Fig. 8b) precursor, and used it as an electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction.

This research summarized two points regarding the high performance of catalysts in electrocatalytic CO2RR. One was the special morphology of the nanoarray, which had more exposed active sites and a faster ion and electro transfer rate. In the control experiments, the catalytic activity of the CuS nanowire sample was much lower than that of the nanosheet samples, as shown in Fig. 9d and Fig. 9e. The other was that the presence of S atoms could stabilize the adsorption of the CO2* intermediate, thereby increasing the selectivity of the CH4. In summary, the morphology of the copper sulfide compound has great influence on the activity and selectivity of electrochemical CO2RR. As mentioned above, through different synthetic methods, a variety of different copper sulfide materials with strange morphology can be obtained, such as hollow spheres, flower-like nanocrystals, 26-facet microcages, etc. These special morphologically structured copper sulfide compounds have not been reported for electrochemical CO2RR before, and further research in this field should be conducted in the future."

[125] designed an S–doped Cu2O–derived Cu catalyst. As shown in Fig. 10a, Cu2O was immersed in an ammonium polysulfide solution, and Cu2-xS catalysts with different S content were obtained by controlling the concentration of ammonium polysulfide (0–5000 μM). The content of sulfur caused the morphology change of the copper sulfide catalyst (Fig. 10b). They found that the ability to reduce CO2 to formate was proportional to the S content of the catalysts (Fig. 10c and d). The catalyst with the highest S content of 2.7 atom% showed the largest FE of 75% at 0.8 V vs. RHE and the largest formate current density of 13.9mA/cm2 at 0.9 V vs. RHE. However, this work just simply confirmed the relationship between S content and product selectivity. The special phase states with different composition, like Cu1⋅97S, Cu1⋅80S, and others have not been further synthesized and studied in the CO2RR field.\n132\nFig. 10.

Shinagawa et al. [126] found that the initial particle size of the copper sulfide catalyst positively affected the selectivity of formate from CO2RR. The carbon-supported copper sulfide catalysts were prepared by wet chemistry under He atmosphere. Using TU as the sulfide precursor and simultaneously controlling the concentration of Cu and S precursors in the solution, granular CuS with different particle size (CuS–1 to CuS–4) could be obtained. The experiment proved that the selectivity of the formate product is proportional to the particle size of the CuS catalyst, meaning larger particle size corresponds to higher FEs to formate (Fig. 11)."

The prepared-CuInS2 thin film was used as the photoelectrode in the solar-driven photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 to methanol, and it could occur at 0.54 V vs. the saturated calomel electrode (SCE), with a faradaic efficiency of 97% and stabilization time of 11 h. As the obtained CuInS2 thin film was a p-type semiconductor, the current density in magnitude was larger under illumination than in the dark. The experiment results showed that the combining with the extra element indium and the introduction of an optical field had significant effects on the catalytic performance. In this electrochemical system, they also studied the coverage of pyridine at the CuInS2 thin film photoelectrode [130] and found that the mass transfer resistance resulting from the pyridine adsorption layer slowed down the reduction rate of CO2.\nCopper sulfide compounds have unique photoelectrochemical properties. In the field of electrochemical CO2 reduction, there has been some basic research. The research on the selective reduction of formate is relatively mature, and can obtain higher FE at lower potential. In addition, methane, methanol and other products can be selectively controlled by controlling the morphology, introducing other elements or external field.

      "text" : "On the basis of the above research, scientists have further studied the mechanism in the electrochemical CO2RR by copper sulfide catalysts. Through in situ surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 13a), Phillips et al. [131] found that HCOO* intermediates were not formed during the reduction process, which means that formate was formed by the one-step reaction of physically adsorbed CO2 hydrogenation (Fig. 13b). A strong adsorption peak of CO was found in the infrared spectrum, while no CO was found in the reduction products, indicating that CO was tightly bound to the catalyst's surface. Combined with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, they proposed that this selectivity was due to the stronger binding of the CO intermediate originating from the remaining subsurface S atoms. The adsorbed CO intermediate could be further selectively reduced to formate at other sites.\nThrough the first principle of simulating the process for CuS electrochemical CO2 reduction, García-Muelas et al. [87] explained why sulfur-modified copper catalysts have a strong selectivity to formate. The simulation result can be summarized into three points: (1) the presence of basic sites where CO2 is tethered blocking its dissociation toward CO, (2) the ability of chalcogens to transfer hydrides to CO2, and (3) the effective blocking of unselective paths on the surrounding Cu atoms.\nAlmost at the same time, based on previous studies on S content and formate selectivity, Yeo et al. [86] continued to delve into the role of S in\nthe enhanced formation of formate on SD-Cu [131].\n110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132\n2 Y.

By comparing CO2 catalytic performance with active CuSx, desulfurized CuSx and bare Cu catalysts, they found that the high selectivity toward formate production can be attributed to the effect of S-doped into the Cu catalyst, rather than the surface morphology. By combining DFT calculation s and isotopic labeling operando Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 14), the results showed that the presence of sulfur weakens the *COOH and HCOO* adsorption energies, which suppress the formation of *COOH toward CO and reduce the energy of the potential-limiting step for formate production. Both hence enhance the formation of formate.\nWe can conclude that, for the copper sulfide catalyst, S is the main promoter of the catalytic performance. The doping of the S atom offers different electrochemical properties, increases the electroactive surface area of the material and improves the ion and electron transport rate. From recent research, the S atom has the ability to combine the hydride with the physical CO2 adsorption capability to form formate, and change the adsorption strength of the CO2 reduction reaction intermediate to reduce the energy barrier."

For example, in electrochemical CO2RR, many factors can affect the activity and selectivity of the final products, such as morphology, structure, S ion, Cu vacancy and others, but which of these factors play a crucial role is still not clear. CuS is not stable in the reduction process and can easily convert into CuO or Cu2O. Thus, exactly which material is working in the CO2 reduction process also needs to be figured out. Furthermore, currently, little research has been developed that can reduce CO2 to high energy density multi–carbon products by means of copper sulfide catalyst. These questions are not only obstacles to large-scale application, but also point the direction for further research to find better copper sulfide catalysts.\nBased on current developments and existing problems, it is recommended that further research be carried out from the following five aspects.\nFirst, new synthesis strategies are needed to prepare copper sulfide materials with different special morphologies and crystal structures such as nano-tips, nanoparticles, two dimensional layered structures, etc., to improve the performance of the catalyst.\nSecond, preparation of copper sulfide crystals with different phase states such as Cu1⋅97S, Cu1⋅80S, etc., is needed to explore whether the copper sulfide materials with atypical crystal structure have different performance during electrochemical CO2RR.\nThird, methods for reducing CO2 to high value multi-carbon products by copper sulfide compound catalysts need to be researched.

It is also possible to explore the method of stabilizing S vacancies from another perspective."

    "abstractText" : "Converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into value-added chemicals by CO2 reduction has been considered as a potential way to solve the current energy crisis and environmental problem. Among the methods of CO2 reduction, the electrochemical method has been widely used due to its mild reaction condition and high reaction efficiency. In the electrochemical reduction system, the CO2 electrocatalyst is the most important part. Although many CO2 electrocatalysts have been developed, efficient catalysts with high activity, selectivity and stability are still lacking. Copper sulfide compound, as a low-toxicity and emerging material, has broad prospects in the field of CO2 reduction due to its unique structural and electrochemical properties. Much progress has been achieved with copper sulfide nanocrystalline and the field is rapidly developing. This paper summarizes the preparation, recent progress in development, and factors affecting the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance with copper sulfide compound as a catalyst. Prospects for future development are also outlined, with the aim of using copper sulfide compound as a highly active and stable electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction. 92",
