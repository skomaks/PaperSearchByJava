      "text" : "Proposed in 1994 [1], STimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy has been revolutionizing our capabilities to unravel intracellular structures and interaction dynamics with optical resolution beyond the diffraction limit, while preserving the advantages of fluorescence microscopy, such as high molecular specificity, multi-target visualization ability and low invasiveness to biology systems. Since the first experimentation at the turn of this century [2, 3], STED nanoscopy has gained a series of milestones, pushing the limit of its spatial [4, 5] and temporal resolution [6, 7], sensitivity [8–10], penetration depth [11–13], multiplexing capability [14–19] and compatibility with in vivo investigations [20– 23]. Concurrently with wide commercialization by several companies [24], STED nanoscopy has helped researchers in life science gain new insights in various fields, e.g. membrane lipid mediation [25, 26], synaptic vesicle sorting [7, 27–29], endocytosis dynamics [30] and virus assemble [31, 32].\nHowever, technical limitations still exist before STED nanoscopy becomes a fundamental and widespread workhorse tool for biology research. For example, the current complex architectures motivate efforts for simplification and cost reduction, e.g. developing low-cost laser sources [33–35] and auto-alignment\ndesign [36, 37]. The widely raised concern about photodamage [38] leads to researches on elaborate control of beam exposure [39–41] and chemical synthesis of photostable tags [42, 43]. Moreover, the occurrence of fluorescence background, which impacts both superresolution imaging and quantitative analysis, is encouraging on-going improvements for background suppression [44].\nIn this review, we will introduce the basic principle of STED nanoscopy and discuss the underlying sources of background noise in STED images. Current researches on alleviating the background noise problem will be presented, such as time-gating, anti-Stokes excitation removal, and off-focus incomplete depletion suppression which is particularly critical when imaging dense samples. Besides superresolution imaging, approaches correcting uncorrelated background photons in quantitative fluorescence correlation spectr oscopy combined with STED (STED-FCS) will also be discussed.\nPrinciple of STED nanoscopy and background sources\nIn a confocal setup, the sample is raster-scanned by a diffraction-limited spot formed by focusing a collimated excitation beam, and the fluorescent photons are sequentially registered for a final\nPrinted in the UK\nPB\n1478-3975\n10.1088/1478-3975/ab255c\n5\n1\n12\n5\nJuly\n2019\n2 Y Ma and T Ha reconstructed image. Confocal microscopy plays an important role in modern life science research due to its optical sectioning ability provided by using a small pinhole conjugated to the excitation spot which limits the depth of observation volume [45, 46]. To further improve its resolving ability, the STED nanoscopy introduces a second beam, called STED beam, to decrease the excitation volume by de-exciting the peripheral fluorophores through stimulated emission (figure 1(a)). To avoid affecting the signals from the central region, the STED beam is wave-front modulated into a hollow spot. A classical doughnutshaped spot is generated by inserting a 0–2π vortex phase plate before the objective [27, 47] (figure 1(b), top), while a bottle-shaped STED spot by modulation with a 0 − π binary phase plate can provide us with the axial confinement [3, 48] (figure 1(b), middle). Finally, incoherent superposition of them will lead to superresolution imaging along all three dimensions [49, 50] (figure 1(c), bottom), as widely employed in the commercialized products. The initial implementations of STED nanoscopy used pulsed lasers for both the excitation and STED beam, benefitting from the provided high STED beam intensity which favors the efficient depletion of excited electrons by the excitation pulse [3, 51]. However, this increases the complexity since it requires a pulsed high-power laser for the STED beam (e.g. mode-locking Ti:Sapphire laser) with elaborate synchronization. Continuous-wave STED (CW-STED), which used a high-power CW laser instead for STED, was proposed to mitigate this problem with the additional advantage of easy access to various wavelength [52]. With pulsed excitation, the inhibit factor, defined as the dependence of remaining fluorescence on the STED intensity normalized by the fluorescence in the absence of STED beam exposure, was derived as [53–55] ηP-STED (ISTED) = exp(−τSTED/τf × ISTED/ISAT) (1) for pulsed STED modality, where τSTED is the pulse width of the STED beam, τf is the fluorescence lifetime, and ISAT is the saturation intensity at which the stimulated emission has the same rate as the fluorescent pathway. For a CW-STED scheme [54], ηCW-STED (ISTED) = 1/(1 + ISTED/ISAT). (2) Equations (1) and (2) represent a Gaussian-shaped point spread function (PSF) for a pulsed STED setup, while a Lorentzian-shaped CW-STED PSF, respectively, when a parabolic approximation is applied for describing the geometry of the STED spot near the focus. In both cases, the resolution of STED nanoscopy, indicated by the full width at half maximum (FWHM), follows a square root law in terms of the STED beam intensity [56, 57] d ∼ dc/ » 1 + d2cβISTED/ISAT (3) where dc is the diffraction-limited resolution of confocal microscopy, and β is a constant dependent on the spatiotemporal characteristics of the STED beam. Notably, the Lorentzian shape of the CW-STED PSF shows relatively slow decay around its central peak. Therefore, the CW-STED images are usually contaminated by low-resolution background attributed to the early fluorescence detection from the periphery prior to enough STED light exposure. By compariso n, the pulsed STED provides better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), because the strongly concentrated STED pulse right after the excitation offers more efficient de-excitation. However, since equation (1) is derived under the assumption of ignorable excitation pulse duration and selective fluorescence detection only after the STED pulse [53, 54], in practice the contrast of STED images can still be not as good as predicted due to the detection of the early fluorescence from peripheral region within the interval between the excitation and STED pulse peak. The excitation by the STED beam itself is another potential source of background noise, which is not considered in the derivation of equations (1)–(3). Ideally, the STED beam will only silence the peripheral fluorophores via stimulated emission which can be spectrally blocked afterward. In practice, however, the STED beam can generate photons of higher energy, a process termed as anti-Stokes excitation [58]. Usually, direct excitation by the STED beam is minimized by setting the STED wavelength at the far-red tail of the fluorophore emission spectrum. However, along with increasing the STED power for higher resolution, the anti-Stokes fluorescence may still not be negligible, especially for the 3D-STED case in which additional STED photon flux with elongated profile is applied for axial confinement. Moreover, CW-STED requires 3–5 times higher STED beam power to achieve the same resolution as the pulsed STED modality [52], leading to even stronger STED excitation. Unique to imaging samples with 3D structure, the third kind of fluorescence background results from the off-focus incomplete depletion [44]. In confocal microscopy, the fluorophores in the focal plane always produce the brightest fluorescence, providing optically sectioned images with high SNR. By contrast, in 2D-STED because of the broadening of the STED spot profile, the depletion in the defocused area is not as efficient as in the vicinity of the focal plane, entailing comparable or even more fluorescent photons from the out-of-focus sections [59] (figures 2(a) and (b)). 2D-STED will provide decent image quality when imaging thin samples (figure 2(c)), but will be contaminated by off-focus ghost when the sample has complex 3D structure (figure 2(d)). Consequently, low-resolution background from off-focus planes smearing in the 2D-STED images can be observed [60]. On the other hand, the bottle-shaped Z-STED Phys. Biol. 16 (2019) 051002\n3\nY Ma and T Ha\nspot cannot solely provide optical-sectioned results unaffected by defocused background either, because the Z-STED profile fails to cover the whole excitation volume, leading to the ghost images produced by the excitation side lobes [60]. Further, increasing the STED power for higher resolution usually associates with the decrease in SNR, especially when the residue STED intensity at the center caused by aberration, index mismatch and imperfect alignment results in the loss of in-focus signal. An appropriate combination of the doughnut and bottle-shaped STED spot with high enough power is expected to offer decent 3D-STED images (figure 2(e))."

      "text" : "The gating detection effect on a pulsed STED setup was presented in 2008 [61], and in 2011, the theory underlying g-STED became complete and the experiments demonstrated substantial improvements [55, 62]. In g-STED, the early fluorescent photons are temporally filtered by only counting the photons after a delay time Tg from each start of excitation. The timegating can be realized either by off-line processing on the recording traces from a time-correlated singlephoton counting (TCSPC) module, or by using a realtime gating electronic circuit. Time-gated detection prevents STED images from corruption by the early fluorescence background [57] (figure 3(b)) with more profound effects on CW-STED (figure 3(a)). The inhibit factor for gated CW-STED reads [55, 57] ηgCW-STED (ISTED) = 1/(1 + ISTED/ISAT) × exp(−Tg/τf × ISTED/ISAT). (4) Compared with equation (2), the second term indicates that the time-gated detection act as a spatial filter trimming the Lorentzian CW-STED PSF into Gaussian shape, thus significantly improving the on-off contrast. Additionally, the resolution of gated CW-STED can also be increased by simply employing a longer detection delay Tg, alleviating the photodamage problem intrinsic to the CW-STED scheme. Experimental implementation of gated CWSTED demonstrated a ~40 nm resolution when the STED power of 230 mW and Tg of 1.5 ns was used (figure 3(b), top), achieving similar performance as the pulsed-STED system but with only one tenth of its peak intensity [57]. Time-gating enhances the resolution and contrast, however, at the expense of signal loss. This is because the time-gating blocks the early fluorescence produced from both the central and peripheral sub-regions, although on average more off-center photons are rejected. Therefore, the improvement using g-STED is usually compromised with the existence of shot noise, and furthermore, uncorrelated anti-Stokes background by continuous STED excitation which is less influenced by time-gating. Additionally, rather than\nPhys. Biol. 16 (2019) 051002\n4\nY Ma and T Ha\ndiscarding photons a method analyzing the photons in different time-gates with a multi-image Richardson– Lucy deconvolution algorithm was proposed to mildly improve the SNR of CW-STED images [63]. Instead of using a simple detection time gate, the entire photons from the very central region of the excitation volume can be extracted by careful analysis on the fluorescence dynamics recorded with a TCSPC module, which is proposed as the SPLIT (short for separation of photons by lifetime tuning) method [64]. In the SPLIT scheme with a 2D-STED setup, the excitation region under STED light exposure was ‘split’ into two concentric areas. Due to the radial symmetry of the STED doughnut spot, the fluorescence from each area shows a unique dynamic corresponding to the local average STED beam intensity. A decomposition with phasor analysis on the TCSPC histogram of photon arrival time is applied to extract the signal only from the central sub-region. Notably, the phasor analysis succeeds in distinguishing the dynamic component of the central region not only from that of its neighborhood, but also from the anti-Stokes background which is uncorrelated with the excitation laser cycle and thus lies at the origin in the phasor domain (figures 3(c) and (d)). Exploiting more dynamic components helps to achieve higher resolution, but is practically limited by shot noise which compromises accurate unmixing. The modulation-enhanced STED (M-STED) was proposed to further develop the concept of SPLIT [65]. In M-STED, the fluorescence dynamics are introduced by tuning the STED power within repetitive line scanning, resulting in a time-resolved stack of STED images corresponding to various STED powers. A phasor analysis following the SPLIT approach was used to calculate the final resolution-enhanced image with the removal of early fluorescence and STEDinduced background (figure 3(e)). The M-STED is readily implemented on any STED microscope, and the experiments with a commercial g-STED setup demonstrated its ability to visualize transcription and replication foci in intact nuclei of eukaryotic cells with improved contrast. Moreover, a direct filtering in the phasor domain was recently shown to provide contrast-improved g-STED images, easing the computation complexity compared with using the SPLIT scheme [66]. Anti-stokes STED excitation removal The STED excitation background can be simply eliminated by measuring the STED-induced background with exposure of the only STED beam and subtracting it from the regular STED image (figure 4(a)). Vicidomini et al applied two time gates between\nFigure 2. Illustration of background noise from off-focus incomplete depletion.

Their approach was demonstrated feasible on both the pulsed and CW-STED modality, and was exploited to maintain the image contrast when blueshifting the STED beam with a 3-fold enhancement of STED efficiency (figure 4(b)). Hernandez et al estimated the anti-Stokes fluorescence background in a gated CW-STED setup by appropriately scaling the photons at the tail of the TCSPC recording, disabling the need of measurement when only the STED beam is applied [67] (figure 4(c)). Bordenave et al adopted similar filtering technique, and demonstrated the ability to use STED wavelength at the emission spectra peak of fluorophores [68]. A 10-fold larger stimulated emission cross section was obtained and equally lower STED power was expected to achieve the same resolution, potentially helpful for reducing photobleaching and easing the restriction on the spectrum of applicable fluorophores. Castello et al captured the STED and background image by pixelwise interruption of the excitation beam using an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) synchronized with a high-speed field-programmable gate array (FPGA) [69] (figure 4(d)). Their system has wide versatility, capable of removing STED-induced background on any modality of STED systems. Rather than using synchronous detection, Ronzitti et al modulated the excitation beam with a AOM and extracted the fluorescence signal at the same frequency, which is produced solely by the excitation beam, with a lockin amplifier [70]. This concept of modulated STED (modSTED) was realized with a setup using CW lasers for both fluorescence excitation and STED (figure 4(e)). Notably, the exploration of novel tags for STED use also encourages removing STED excitation background. For example, Hanne et al demonstrated quantum dots enabling repeated STED recordings with >1000 frames and ~50 nm resolution, while the pronounced STED-elicited background problem was solved by acquisition of raw STED images and background collections in line-wise alternation and subsequent subtraction [71] (figure 4(f)). Compared with subtracting the anti-Stokes background afterward, avoiding STED light overexposure which potentially introduces undesired STED-induced\nFigure 3.

This adaptive STED-illumination strategy reduces STED excitation background particularly in 3D-STED images, because it helps to avoid intense exposure to the ultra-long axial crest of the Z-STED profile. As demonstrated, the ghost images flanking the actual structure with the conventional scanning scheme was removed by using DyMIN scanning (figure 4(g)). More importantly, DyMIN lowers the STED light dose up to ~20-fold under common biological imaging conditions, resulting in accordingly brighter images at <30 nm resolution. Suppression of off-focus incomplete depletion background: STEDD, and CH-STED The off-focus incomplete depletion background had been difficult to identify, because it can only be detected in the presence of the excitation beam. Gao et al firstly proposed the stimulated emission double depletion (STEDD) method aiming at suppressing the background noise from both the STED excitation and incomplete depletion in 3D-STED setups [44]. Implemented with a pulsed STED system, the STEDD introduced a second STED pulse (STED2) with a delay of around half of the fluorescence lifetime after the first STED pulse (STED1) of conventional 3D-STED profile (figure 5(a)). Specially, without phase modulation, the STED2 pulse has a Gaussian intensity profile, resulting in the depletion of fluorescence from the central sub-region of the excitation volume. Therefore, the remaining photons after the STED2 pulse in the TCSPC recording are solely from the excitation by the STED1 pulse and off-focus incomplete depletion escaping from the STED2 pulse. An appropriate scaling of the residue fluorescence was subtracted from the g-STED image reconstructed from the TCSPC histogram, leading to sufficient background suppression [72]. The feasibility of the STEDD method was demonstrated on both 3D (figure 5(b)) and live-cell samples with ~60 nm resolution. The 3D-STED scheme, however, is subject to the two following limitations due to the addition of the Z-STED spot: (i) increased undesired STED-excitation background from the crests deep into the defocused areas; (ii) reduced signal caused by the STED intensity residue at the center, because the Z-STED spot is much more susceptive to aberrations and refraction index mismatch compared with XY-STED [73–76]. Correspondingly, the coherent-hybrid STED (CH-STED), was very recently proposed aiming at improving the optical sectioning ability of 2D-STED without introducing Z-STED [60]. In their method, the vortex phase pattern, which is commonly used for generating the doughnut STED spot, was updated with a bi-vortex pattern by adding a π phase shift into the peripheral region on the spatial light modulator (SLM), while maintaining the handedness of the phase gradient. The introduced thin ring of vortex phase distribution results in an elongated and narrowed ver-\nFigure 5. Suppression of off-focus incomplete depletion background. (a) Detailed temporal sequence of fluorescence depletion in STEDD. Fluorescent photons shortly after the first STED1 pulse are mostly from the central region but corrupted with the peripheral background photons escaping depletion or excited by the STED1 pulse. The Gaussian-shaped STED2 pulse with lower power will deplete the photons from the central region, making the peripheral background photons separated and detectable.

High-contrast imaging of complex biological structures, such as mitotic spindles and neuron cell bodies has been demonstrated by CH-STED compatible with a commercial STED system (Abberior Instruments, ‘Expert Line’ gated-STED with ‘easy3D’ module) (figure 5(d)). Uncorrelated background correction in STED-FCS Besides superresolution imaging, the STED nanoscopy has also been combined with FCS to help us study the molecular mobility at the nanometer scale (figure 6(a)). In FCS, the fluorescence signal fluctuations are recorded over time as tagged molecules diffuse in and out of an observation area or volume, of which the auto-correlation function (ACF) is calculated whose amplitude, lagging time and anomaly in shape reflect important information such as diffusion coefficients, concentrations and existence of hindrances. The marriage of FCS to STED has provided us with unprecedented capability of revealing subtle interactions in living systems which otherwise will be overwhelmed due to the limited resolution [25, 77]. Notably, in STED-FCS, it is still critical to remove the background which otherwise renders the conventional FCS model based on Gaussian profile inapplicable. For example, in CW-STED-FCS time-gating is necessary to remove the pedestal background for accurate analysis on diffusion in two-dimensional (2D) systems such as the plasma membrane of living cells [78], as reflected by the correction on the anomaly coefficient after applying a long enough gating delay [55] (figure 6(b), bottom). Moreover, Leutenegger et al proposed a STED-FCS system combined with a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope which provides axial confinement of ~55 nm, enabling observation on the lipid analogs in supported lipid bilayers in the presence of background noise [79]. The observation of nanoscale diffusion in 3D environment by STED-FCS is even more challenging because of the increased off-focus background (figure 6(c), top-left). Identified in the first implementation of STED-FCS [80], the uncorrelated background with respect to the modeled Gaussian-shaped observation volume results in severe overestimation of the particle\nFigure 6.

However, the complex formula form compared with the ACF precludes its wide application. Fortunately, the SPLIT [81] (figure 6(d)) and STEDD [44] method discussed above has been successfully employed in STED-FCS, enabling accurate 3D-FCS analysis even inside living cells. Moreover, researches on corrections of the classical FCS model for suitability with the STED-FCS were also presented [59, 82], providing simple alternatives when hardware modification is impractical."

      "heading" : "Conclusion",
      "text" : "Besides the techniques mentioned above, various computational methods were also intensively utilized for improving the STED image quality against background noise, such as 2D/3D deconvolution [83, 84], rolling-ball background subtraction [85], wavelet decomposition [86] as well as block matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) [87]. A comprehensive comparison of several discussed techniques is shown in table 1. For the subtractionbased techniques, the main limiting factor for imaging speed is the minimum pixel dwell time to achieve robust background estimation against shot noise. The speed of hardware response also needs to be considered (e.g. in modSTED and DyMIN). Many techniques are not limited by the STED modality, while the STEDD principally can only be implemented with pulsed STED. With respect to the system complexity, a TCSPC module inevitably increase the cost, but becomes an essential part for CW-STED and pulsed STED using less expensive nanosecond STED lasers. Elaborate feedback control is needed in DyMIN, while the STEDD is the most complicated due to its requirement of extra beam path and careful timing design. Notably, the only modification of a static phase plate pattern makes CH-STED easy to implement on any setups. Finally, we envision a proper combination of different approaches providing better background suppression under various conditions. The recent ascendant development of parallelization in STED imaging process [88–92] for increased frame rate can also benefit from incorporating the background removal techniques, because the application of array excitation and detection increases background noise from off-focus crosstalk, scattering et al. Moreover, although the discussions in this review focus on the approaches in STED imaging, similar ideas can also be exploited in improving the images by using the reversible saturable optical fluorescent transition (RESOLFT) setups which use reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins for superresolution imaging at much lower intensity [93–95]. In fact, several approaches, such as rate-gated detection [96], MOST (Multiple Off State Transitions) [97] and MoNaLISA (Molecular Nanoscale Live Imaging with Sectioning Ability) [98], have been proposed for improving the RESOLFT image contrast with both point-scanning and wide-field based configurations. With our deepened comprehension of the light–matter interaction underlying the STED imaging process, it should be possible to make the STED nanoscopy more powerful in the future after additional improvements."

However, in practice the unwanted background noise degrades the STED image quality and precludes quantitative analysis. Here, we discuss the underlying sources of the background noise in STED images, and review current approaches to alleviate this problem, such as time-gating, antiStokes excitation removal, and off-focus incomplete depletion suppression. Progress in correcting uncorrelated background photons in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy combined with STED (STED-FCS) will also be discussed. TOPICAL REVIEW 2019",
