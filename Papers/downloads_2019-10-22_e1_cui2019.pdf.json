      "text" : "Similar to the widely studied noble metals like silver, gold and platinum [1,2], noble metal iridium (Ir) at nanoscale also exhibits interesting optical, electronic, magnetic, mechanical and catalytic properties [3,4]. As an element in platinum group (i.e. ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), nano-sized Ir also possess superior stability, catalytic activity and corrosion resistance due to its distinctive electronic structure and large surface area-to-volume ratios [5–11]. Ir nanostructures have been used as catalyst for various reactions. For instance, the development of Shell 405 represented a milestone catalyst to catalyze the decomposition of hydrazine for hydrogen production, providing enough energy and power for launching satellite [12]. Ir nanostructures have also exhibited enzyme-like activity, which overcome the intrinsic drawbacks of natural enzymes including time-consuming, labor-intensive purification/immobilization and low stability to environmental factors [13,14]. It can see that the easy preparation, less costly enzyme mimetics, and superior stability/catalytic activity of Ir nanostructures will open up tremendous prospects in high catalytic efficiency, specificity and selectivity. So far, the catalytic performance of Ir nanostructures has been exploited broadly and used factually while the applications of their optical and electronic properties still face a great challenge ahead.\nThe size, shape/morphology and composition determine the physical and chemical properties of Ir nanostructures. As compared to Ir nanoparticles (NPs) [15] and Ir nanochain-like structures [16], stronger surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance was achieved when depositing Ir nanostructures on the surface of nanopillars with a periodic arrangement [17], in which highly symmetrical distribution of hot spots within the interpillar gaps endows them with superior SERS activity. The luminescence properties of Ir nanostructures are dependent on the interaction of Ir3+ precursor with ligands during their preparation. For instance, fluorescent Ir nanoclusters (NCs) of smaller than 2 nm form after reducing Ir3+ with ligands [18,19]. Also, stable phosphorescent complex generates after coordinating Ir3+ with ligands [20]. It is thus of paramount importance in controlled synthesis of Ir nanostructures to furnish new platform and investigate new properties and promising applications.\nIn this review, we provide a timely summarization and discussion on various synthetic approaches to Ir nanostructures and their unique catalytic, SERS and luminescence properties. Then we systematically summarized their significant applications and developments (e.g. catalysis, optics and biomedicine) with a focus on catalytic applications in catalytic hydrogenation/hydrogen production, fuel cell reactions, tail gas purification, and biomimetic enzymation. Further, we provide insights and perspectives on potential challenges ahead to emerging preparation strategies, physical and chemical properties and promising applications."

      "text" : "The synthetic strategies to Ir nanostructures, such as incipient wetness method developed more than thirty years ago, have attracted much attention due to their extremely high catalytic performance [21]. More synthetic strategies including chemical, photochemical and electrochemical reduction have been developed recently to prepare highly dispersed Ir nanostructures in solutions for obtaining unique optical and electronic properties. Based on\nthermal decomposition strategy, the Ir nanomaterials can be prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, hydrothermal, sonochemical and microwave-assisted synthesis strategies. The Ir nanomaterials can also be prepared using synthetic matrix, such as preparation in ionic liquid and sputtering methods. Different synthetic strategies can affect the morphology and performance of the Ir nanomaterials. Accordingly, we will discuss the various synthesis strategies based on the performance and application of the Ir nanomaterials."

      "heading" : "2.1. Chemical reduction",
      "text" : "Chemical reduction is commonly used to prepare Ir NPs in onepot reactions. It usually involves one-pot synthesis based on successive chemical reduction of reactants in one reactor to obtain expected product without sophisticated processes for separation and purification of intermediate compound. This strategy can shorten the reaction time and improve the utilization rate of reactants. Thiol-functionalized Ir NPs of 2.25–4.25 nm in size were prepared via one-pot synthesis by Ulman et al. using octadecanethiol as stabilizer and H2IrCl6 as precursor via the reduction of lithium triethylborohydride in tetrahydrofuran medium [22]. They were highly crystalline with face-centered cube (fcc) packing and readily prepared under ambient temperature under the necessary protection of inert atmosphere. Also, Ir NPs with the average size of 3 nm were prepared by Urbina et al. via one-pot synthesis through the mild reduction of IrCl3 precursor with ethylene glycol at 100 C [23]. Recently, nanochain-like Ir nanomaterials were further prepared via one-pot synthesis by Sampath et al. under the chemical reduction of IrCl3 precursor with NaBH4 at 80 C while using ascorbic acid as stabilizer [16]. Irregular Ir NPs formed in the initial stage of 5 min and then aggregated and selfassembled into interconnected nanostructures with prolonging the reaction time up to 15 min. The primary particle size was about 3.8 ± 0.3 nm, while the length of the nanochain-like Ir nanomaterials reached to micron level (Fig. 1A). The nanochain-like Ir nanomaterials showed polycrystalline structure (Fig. 1B) and the reflection rings (Fig. 1C) corresponded to {1 1 1}, {2 0 0}, {2 2 0} and {3 1 1} facets of fcc Ir (Fig. 1D). These synthetic processes suggest that the morphology of Ir nanostructures is determined by the reaction conditions including reducing agents and reaction media."

      "heading" : "2.2. Photochemical reduction",
      "text" : "Photochemical reduction is a gentle strategy for photoreductive synthesis of Ir NPs under the irradiation of light, in which organics generate free radicals for reducing Ir3+ precursor to form Ir NPs. Kundu et al. prepared Ir nanostructures with different morphologies photochemically [4] while using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) micellar and 2,7-dihydroxynaphthalene as shape-controlling agent and photosensitizer, respectively. Under UV-irradiation, the hydroxyl compounds and hydroxyl ions undergo hydroxylic cleavage to generate OH in alkaline media [24], which can initiate the reduction of Ir3+ to form Ir0 seeds followed by seeded-growth into larger Ir nanostructures. Meanwhile, the Ir0 seeds can also catalyze the reduction of Ir3+ to accelerate the formation of Ir nanostructures. However, the adsorption of CTAB on the surface of Ir crystal planes may slow down the growth rate of Ir crystallites.\nThe formation of specific shapes mainly depends on both the growth kinetics of Ir (e.g. the supply rate of Ir0 to different crystallographic planes) and the faceting tendency of stabilizing agent [25]. Mostly, spherical Ir NPs formed at a lower concentration of CTAB whereas anisotropic Ir nanostructures were observed at higher concentration of CTAB. For examples, Ir nano-chains, nano-flakes and nano-needles formed at 10 3 M, 10 2 M and 10 1 M CTAB, respectively (Fig. 2). Different concentrations of CTAB can self-assemble micellar templates with varied shapes to facilitate the formation of different shaped Ir nanostructures [26]. When lowering the concentration of CTAB to 10 4 M, only spherical Ir NPs formed.\nThe photoreductive synthesis of Ir NPs was also implemented in a microfluidic process by Köhler et al. [27]. As shown in Fig. 3, Ir3+, 2-hydroxy-40-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone and PVP solutions as respective reaction precursor, photoinitiator and stabilizer were injected separately into different flow tubes and mixed at a suitable location through controlling the flow rates by syringe pumps. Under the irradiation of UV light, photosensitive reaction was triggered to reduce Ir3+ to Ir0. The size and optical property of resulting Ir NPs can be tuned by controlling the flow rate, the molar ratio of precursor to stabilizer, and the irradiation time. This method has advantage in controllable reaction, rapid nucleation rate, and uniform particles distribution."

      "heading" : "2.3. Electrochemical reduction",
      "text" : "Electrochemical formation of nanocrystals involves a redox reaction, in which the dissolved metal cations are discharged, nucleated and grown on the cathode when imposed by an appropriate potential. The electrochemical deposition includes direct current, alternating current, pulsed, and composite electrodeposition. Through adjusting voltage together with current and electrolyte, the size, structure, thickness and components of nanocrystals can form in controlled manner. The electrochemical deposition is carried out under ambient temperature and pressure conditions so as to conserve energy. A better epitaxial growth of atoms can be achieved on single crystal substrate for favorable preparation of single nanocrystals. Seong et al. electrodeposited Ir NPs on single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) film as electrode by chronocoulometry technique using IrCl3 solution as electrolyte [28]. The Ir NPs were homogeneous and uniform with the average particle size of 100–180 nm as observed by the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The surface area of the electrode was increased with the decoration of Ir NPs, and the mass transport process of the reaction solution and local microenvironment were improved. Although the film obtained from electrodeposition may undergo cracking, this issue can be effectively addressed by ultrasound-assisted electrodeposition technique [29,30]. Ultrasound reduced the thickness of the diffusion layer so that the deposited Ir NPs film was thin enough. The cracks of Ir NPs film were thus reduced and the performance of modified electrode was improved."

      "heading" : "2.4. Thermal decomposition",
      "text" : "Thermal decomposition involves a chemical decomposition under high temperature, which breaks the chemical bonds of metal precursor for activating and reducing the precursor to form nanomaterials. As an important thermal decomposition technique, incipient wetness impregnation is carried out sequentially by dispersing precursor in solution, impregnating into porous carrier, penetrating and adsorbing onto its inner surface, and this followed by drying to remove residual liquid and roasting/activating the precursor to form Ir nanostructures. Advantages of incipient wetness impregnation mainly include the improved utilization rate\nof precursor, desirable physical structure provided by carrier, and efficient and uniform distribution of nanomaterials on the inner surface of carrier. The nanostructures with large specific surface, suitable particle size and mechanical strength, and good thermal conductivity can be prepared by this technique as good nanocatalyst.\nKip et al. prepared Ir nanocatalyst in 1986 via incipient wetness impregnation by using porous c-Al2O3 and SiO2 as carriers [21]. The attached catalyst onto the inner surface of carriers with different pore size and internal structure was used to catalyze the decomposition of hydrazine in propulsion satellite systems [31–33]. Ir nanocatalyst can also be prepared by using b-polymorph A (BEA) zeolite as carrier via incipient wetness impregnation for catalyzing the hydrogenation of cellulose to produce sorbitol [34]. To generate Ir nanocatalyst, the carriers was sequentially impregnated by Ir(acac)3 solution, dried for 2 h at 60 C, calcined and activated for 4 h at 300 C, and finally reduced in hydrogen flow (30 cm3/min) for 6 h at 450 C. The same procedure was also used for preparing Ru, Rh and Pd nanocatalysts, which showed their selectivity on the hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellulose to sorbitol paralleled the d-band width of the metals (Ir > Ru > Rh > Pd). The hydrogenation of tetralin can also be catalyzed by Ir nanocatalyst prepared in titania-modified SBA-16 carrier [35]. In spite of incipient wetness impregnation plays a significant role in the preparation of Ir nanocatalyst, there is some drawbacks that cannot be ignored, such as the generation of exhaust gases during the calcination decomposition. The impregnation process can affect the inner surface structure of the carrier, and hence the adsorption performance of carrier against the precursor is affected. The homogeneity and catalytic performance of Ir nanomaterials are restricted by the pore size, porosity and internal specific surface of the carrier. Thus, environmental friendly and highly efficient synthetic strategies are explored in recent years such as microwave-assisted synthesis."

      "heading" : "2.5. Hydrothermal synthesis",
      "text" : "Hydrothermal synthesis refers to the aqueous synthesis of nanocrystals in subcritical and supercritical state under high temperature and high pressure. This synthesis strategy is carried out in a closed system avoiding the environmental pollution resulting from the use of toxic organic solvent. However, the growth of nanocrystals is difficult to be observed because the reaction cannot be terminated opportunely under high pressure of autoclaves and the hysteresis effect from waste heat. Che et al. prepared Ir NPs in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, pH 7.4) under hydrothermal conditions (180 C) in Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave [36]. The basicity of reaction medium is important to obtain the dispersity and stability of nanomaterials (Fig. 4). The well-dispersed Ir NPs formed at pH 7.4–9.4 but aggregated when pH was reduced to less than 6.4. HEPES can adjust the acidity of the reaction system. Meanwhile, HEPES can be used as both reductant and stabilizer for preparing Ir NPs. The two tertiary amines and terminal hydroxyl groups of HEPES reduced the Ir3+ and stabilized the Ir NPs via bonding to Ir NPs so as to prevent their aggregation."

      "text" : "Ultrasonic radiation can propagate in liquid to produce cavitation, which provides a special environment for the rapid growth and formation of nanomaterials [37]. The local tensile stress contributes to the formation of negative pressure in the solution supersaturated with gas. The gas can easily escape the liquid surface to form bubbles, which undergo gradual growth and rupture with the vibration of the medium. The rupture leads to the local\nliquid to produce high temperature, high pressure and shock wave. Roucoux et al. reported the sonochemical synthesis of Ir NPs stabilized by N,N-dimethyl-N-cetyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonium chloride via the reduction of NaBH4 [38]. In aqueous solution, the surfactant monomers associated can form micelles as nanosynthetic template to provide a microenvironment for the formation of Ir NPs. These micelles can maintain the uniform dispersion of Ir NPs. However, sonochemical process can form by-products easily, and shows a limitation for the large-scale industrial produc-\ntion of nanomaterials because of the expensive equipment and serious pollution of sound."

[39], copyright 2010, Wiley-VCH).\nmolecular friction. Once microwave source is off, the reaction is terminated immediately to avoid the hysteresis effect from waste heat. Janiak et al. prepared the microwave-assisted synthesis of Ir NPs by using [Ir6(CO)16] as precursor and 1-butyl-3-methylimida zoliumtetrafluoroborate ([BMIm][BF]4) as reaction media in an argon atmosphere [39]. This is a more efficient process (10 W, 3 min) compared to UV-photolytic (1000 W, 15 min) and conventional thermal decomposition (180–250 C, 6 h). The Ir NPs prepared were more uniform than those prepared photolytic decomposition (Fig. 5). It is the key to use [BMIm][BF]4 with high ionic charge, polarity and dielectric constant because it can absorb microwave energy effectively for rapidly heating the reaction system to facilitate the formation of Ir NPs. With supramolecular network structure, [BMIm][BF]4 can serve as nanosynthetic template for preparation of Ir NPs [40]. It can also provide electrostatic protection for Ir NPs via the formation of a ‘‘protective shell”."

Under the bombardment of the charged ions, the surface of target is atomized, and the resulting neutral atoms are sputtered to the surface of substrate to form nanoparticles or nanofilms. This method can be used to prepare the high melting point metal nanomaterials, and composites one when multiple targeted materials are used at the same time. The particle size distribution of nanomaterials prepared by sputtering method is relatively narrow. Kreyling et al. prepared the Ir aerosol by sputtering method to simulate ultrafine particles and study the toxicological effects of ultrafine particles against organisms [41,42]. Niwa et al. co-sputtered Ir and carbon to form the composite Ir/carbon film electrode [43], in which Ir NPs of 2 nm in size were dispersed evenly across the surface of carbon film. They were applied in the determination of H2O2 and L-glutamate and exhibited high enzyme-like activity. The sputtering method can control the size and morphology of nanoparticles more easily compared with flame method and tube furnace method."

      "text" : "Ionic liquids (ILs) can form extended hydrogen-bond networks in liquid state and display high self-organization at nanomolecular scale. These structural organizations can be sued as ‘‘entropic drivers” for the formation of soluble metal nanoparticles in situ [44]. ILs can be used over large temperature range ( 80 to 400 C) due to their high thermal and chemical stability. They are thus well suited for the thermodynamic controllable preparation of nanomaterials. Because the vapor pressures of ILs are extremely low ( 10 10 Pa at 25 C), environmental pollution caused by solvent evaporation can be avoided in the preparation process of nanomaterials. ILs have large electrochemical window, the electrochemical performance of nanomaterial can be characterized in wide range. They also display high ion density, low viscosity and good dissolving ability for polar and nonpolar substances. Resort to these advantages, ILs can be used as idea stabilizer for green, efficient preparation of nanomaterials [45].\nDupont et al. prepared the irregularly sized spherical (from 1.9 ± 0.4 to 3.6 ± 0.4 nm) and worm-like Ir NPs using [Ir(COD)2]BF4 and [Ir(COD)Cl]2 as precursors in 1-alkyl3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [46] (Fig. 6). The morphology of Ir NPs depended on the type of Ir precursor and the size, volume and nano-region of the hydrogen-bond networks. [Ir(COD)2]BF4 tends to be dissolved and concentrated in the polar regions of ILs, while [Ir(COD)Cl]2 is dissolved preferentially in the non-polar regions of ILs. The structural organization of the ILs can be altered by changing the N-alkyl imidazolium side chain of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium. As such, the spherical and wormlike Ir NPs formed in C1C4I BF4 and C1C10I∙BF4 ILs media while using [Ir(COD)2]BF4 and [Ir(COD)Cl]2 as precursors, respectively.\nAmong the above synthetic strategies, sputtering method fits the preparation of high melting point metal nanofilms as a physical synthetic technique. Incipient wetness impregnation has been widely used in the preparation of metal nanocatalyst as a classical thermal decomposition technique.

      "text" : "With seven electrons in 5d orbital, metal Ir can adsorb some small molecules and react with them to form intermediate compounds to exhibit the catalytic activity. As known, Ir nanomaterials can not only adsorb CO, O2, C2H4, C2H2 and H2 but also catalyze the reactions of oxidation, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, cyclization, isomerization, pyrolysis and hydrogenolysis. Fig. 7 shows the adsorbed state of oxygen on the surface of metal Ir. Firstly, oxygen molecule is absorbed on the Ir surface, and then dissociated into atomic oxygen (Fig. 7B). The dissociation of oxygen molecule takes precedence over defective metal surface, such as the steps, edges, and kinks sites of nanomaterials. The atomic state I is first formed in dissociation, which possesses the highest reactivity. Then it will be further migrated into the Ir atomic layer and forms the atomic state II which displays much smaller reactivity than atomic state I. With the increasing of reaction temperature, atomic state II will enter into more Ir atomic layer to form threedimensional metal oxides which exhibit smallest reactivity comparing with atomic state I and II. This suggests that the catalytic activity of Ir nanomaterials can be adjusted by controlling the adsorbed oxygen atomic state on the surface of metal Ir.\nEarly in 1987, Aramata et al. found that nanosized Ir catalyzed dissolved oxygen to generate various oxygen species in H2SO4 medium. These oxygen species can oxidize methanol at a lower potential, suggesting the high catalytic activity of nanosized Ir [48]. Subsequently, Pt-Ir nanocomposites were prepared for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol and formic acid [49,50]. Pt NPs have an extremely low efficiency of electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid due to a serious poisoning of CO [51]. When doped with Ir, Pt-Ir nanocomposites greatly enhanced tolerance to the concentration of CO. With the increase of Ir content, the electrocatalytic activity of nanocomposites is greatly improved due to their synergistic effects [47]. In addition, Pd-Ir core-shell nanocubes were prepared by Xia et al. to have the average particle size of\n18 nm and the Ir shell thickness of 0.6 nm on Pd nanocubes [52]. With much higher reactivity of Ir for adsorbing oxygencontaining species than Pd, the deposition of Ir onto Pd nanocubes can improve the peroxidase mimic activity effectively. Overall, the catalytic activity of Ir nanomaterials is dependent on the morphology, crystal faces and atoms arrangement [53]. The nanomaterials containing high index planes possess much more catalytic active sites and higher surface energy than those close-packed lowindex facets [54]. The surface energy of different crystal facets follows the order of c{1 1 1} < c{1 0 0} < c{1 1 0} < c{h k l}."

      "heading" : "3.2. SERS activity",
      "text" : "SERS is the amplified Raman scattering of molecules adsorbed on the surface of nanomaterials, which is dependent on the enhanced electromagnetic (EM) induced by the localized surface plasmons and the formation of charge-transfer complexes [55]. The SERS intensity primarily relies on the EM field on the surface of nanomaterials and the ‘‘hot spot” formed between the closely packed nanoparticles (Fig. 8A), and it is amplified extraordinarily with the increase of EM field and ‘‘hot-spot” number. As the interparticle nanogaps decrease, the EM intensity gradually increases, especially for the 1 nm nanogaps between nanoparticles (Fig. 8B). Thus, the SERS performance can be largely improved by controlling the synthesis of metal nanomaterials with targeted nanogaps. Five plasmonic nanogap structures were included for illustration (Fig. 8C). The former three systems formed between the nanoparticles. They are the interparticle nanogaps, nanocrevice gaps and intraparticle nanogaps. The two others are nanogaps between nanoparticles and a flat surface and the nanogaps formed on a flat surface.\nIn 2014, Ir nanochain-like structures were prepared by using IrCl3 and ascorbic acid as precursor and stabilizer, respectively [16]. Under the radiation of visible light, strong EM field enhancements arose at the interparticle junctions in nanoparticle aggregates. The SERS activity of Ir nanochain-like structures was evaluated using 4-mercaptopyridine as the analyte. The detection limit (DL) was calculated to be 0.1 lM. Subsequently, Ir NPs with SERS activity were prepared [15]. The average diameter of the Ir NPs was about 2.5 ± 0.5 nm. When the Ir NPs were concentrated, their particle size grew to around 50 nm and the strong SERS activity was observed between interparticles. The enhancement factor (EF) of the Ir NPs was calculated to be 3.5 105 by using Rhodamine 6G as the probe molecule. It is comparable with that of Au nanostars [56]. The Ir NPs has been successfully applied to the determination of the industrial colorant Sudan Red I with the DL of 0.6 nM. In order to improve the SERS activity of Ir nanomaterials, Kang et al. prepared the Ir-coated Nanopillars by depositing the Ir atomic layer on the surface of nanopillars (hydrogen silsesquioxane) with the periodic arrangement [17]. The nanogap width between interpillars was <10 nm. Thus, the strong EM field generated between interpillars and the hot spots were evenly distributed within the high symmetrically interpillar gaps upon inter-\nf free metal Ir, (B) molecular state, (C) atomic state I, (D) atomic state II, (E) atomic\naction with visible radiation (Fig. 9). This Ir nanostructure exhibited the significant SERS activity equaling to the silver based substrate. The corrosion resistance like gold also endowed the Ir nanomaterials with excellent stability."

      "text" : "Compared with conventional fluorescent proteins and small molecular dyes, noble metal fluorescent nanomaterials reveal controllable fluorescence emission with other superior physiochemical properties such as good stability, large specific surface area, and low biological toxicity [57]. As an alternative to conventional fluorescence dyes, noble metal fluorescent nanomaterials have been exploited to promote the rapid development of optical and electronic equipment, biological imaging and nanomedicine [58,59]. For AuNCs, AgNCs and Au@Ag NCs, their stability and optical performance will decrease upon suffering their aggregation and oxidation. With the excellent corrosion resistance of Ir nanomate-\nrials, fluorescent Ir NCs will exhibit better stability, and thus their exploration will exhibit significant research value in theory and applications. The fluorescent Ir NCs was prepared by Vankayala et al. for the first time [60]. The aqueous solution of Ir3+ precursor was firstly extracted into organic phase via a phase transfer reagent, tetraoctyl ammonium bromide (TOAB). Then dodecylamine and NaBH4 were added successively to stabilize and reduce Ir3+ for preparing Ir NPs. The Ir NPs were further refluxed in the presence of 2,20-binaphthol (BINOL) ligand to prepare fluorescent BINOL-Ir NCs (Fig. 10). The average size of the Ir NCs was about 2 nm and the quantum yield was estimated to be 36%. As shown in Fig. 11, the Ir NCs have three obvious absorbance peaks at 449, 480 and 515 nm. The in vitro cytotoxicity investigation in Hela cells exhibited good biocompatibility, excellent co-localization and distribution throughout cytoplasm region. Hence, they can serve as an efficient intracellular fluorescent marker or nanocarrier for carrying biological molecules and anticancer drugs. In spite of the successful synthesis of fluorescent Ir NCs is exciting, the\npreparation process is quite complex and time-consuming. The use of much toxic organic reagents has also restricted its wide application.\nSubsequently, the fluorescent Ir NCs with blue emission were prepared by a solid-state route [18]. Precursor IrCl3, stabilizer 2- phenylethanethiol (PET) and reducing agent NaBH4 were mixed\ntogether and then ground for 10–15 min to turn yellow. After purified by extracting in toluene and re-dispersed in organic solvents, including toluene, tetrahydrofuran and dichloromethane, the fluorescent Ir NCs of 2 nm in size exhibited three obvious emission peaks at 404, 432 and 460 nm. Although this synthetic strategy was simple and rapid, the fluorescence intensity was much lower\nd NP-3 (Reprinted with permission from Ref. [20], copyright 2014, Wiley-VCH).\ncompared to many other noble metal NCs [61]. Recently, fluorescent Ir NCs of 1.5 nm in size were also prepared in DMF medium [62]. Under 140 C, the DMF was decomposed into CO, methylamine and dimethylamine with reducibility [63], which can adsorb on the surface of Ir3+ and reduced Ir3+ to Ir(0). The MALDI-TOF MS spectrum demonstrated Ir NCs containing 2–7 Ir atoms. The masses of the dominant molecular ions at 500.424, 750.598, 1001.801, 1251.972, 1503.166 and 1754.271 are in accordance with Ir2(CO)[N(CH3)2]2, Ir3(CO)2[N(CH3)2]2(NHCH3), Ir4(CO)3[N(CH3)2]2(NHCH3)2, Ir5(CO)4[N(CH3)2]2(NHCH3)3, Ir6(CO)5[N(CH3)2]2(NHCH3)4 and Ir7(CO)6[N(CH3)2]2(NHCH3)5. Ir NCs show well solubility was in polar solvents [62], and their catalytic activity was evaluated for the methylations of alcohols and anilines using methanol as the source of C1 [19]. Compared with the first two methods, this approach for preparing Ir NCs is more economical, green and simple due to the one-pot synthesis by using only precursor IrCl3 and solvent DMF.\nAs another type of luminescent materials, phosphorescent Ir NPs comprise a stable iridium complex generated by coordinating two pyridine units through the formation of iridium chloridebridged dimer. Based on this coordination reaction, Yang et al. prepared three different phosphorescent Ir NPs (NP-1, NP-2 and NP-3) by crosslinking pyridine blocks to form iridium chloride-bridged dimers in P4VP-b-PEO polymer [20] (Fig. 12). The absorbance bands of 250–350 nm and 400–450 nm were assigned to the spin-allowed intraligand (p-p*) transitions of the C^N ligand and the mixed singlet and triplet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer states, respectively (Fig. 13). The Ir NP-1, NP-2 and NP-3 emitted yellow, red and green phosphorescence under the excitation of 365 nm UV light, and the corresponding maximum emission wavelengths located at 583, 627 and 567 nm, respectively. Their phosphorescence emissions resulted from the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer transitions. The flow cytometry and laser confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that Ir NPs were effectively uptaken by Hela cells and thus used as luminescent probes for studying living cells. Upon the irradiation with visible light for 10 min, the Ir NPs induced the apoptosis of approximately 90% Hela cells caused by the generation of 1O2, suggesting the potential of phosphorescent Ir NPs for photodynamic therapy.\nThe optical and electronic properties of Ir nanomaterials determine their catalytic activity, SERS activity and luminescent performance. The catalytic activity results from the adsorption capacity against small molecules due to the unfilled 5d orbital. The SERS activity derives from the localized surface plasmon resonance of surface conduction electrons of Ir nanomaterials excited by electromagnetic radiation. The spatial confinement of free electrons in Ir NCs results in the molecular-like fluorescence. The metalto-ligand charge-transfer transitions of Ir NPs result in the phosphorescence. As these properties are closely related to the\nmicrostructures and morphologies of Ir nanomaterials, appropriate synthesis strategies should be designed to prepare the Ir nanomaterials to achieve the targeted performance."

It was reported that Ir/TiO2 selectively catalyzed the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond of citral [64] (Fig. 14). Upon the addition of Fe3+ or Ge4+, new active sites (FeOx, GeOx or TiOx species) are generated in Ir/TiO2 with a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). They contributed to the polarization of the carbonyl group and thus the selectively hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohol was significantly enhanced. As prepared by incipient wetness impregnation and flame spray pyrolysis, Ir/Al2O3 and Ir/SiO2 catalysts were used respectively for the ethyl pyruvate hydrogenation by using cinchonidine as a chiral modifier by Bachiller-Baeza et al. [65]. The acid and base properties of supports can change the electronic properties of Ir, and the Ir-support interaction can control the characteristics of the Ir-hydrogen bond, adsorption mode and strength of modifier and substrate on Ir. Thus, the Ir NPs with different surface structures caused by the interaction with support may affect the enantioselectivities to (R)-ethyl lactate. Using asymmetric secondary phosphine oxide (4,5-dihydro-3H-dinaphtho[2,1-c:10,20-e] phosphepine-4-oxide) as ligand, chiral Ir NPs catalyst was prepared by H2 reduction (1,5-cyclooctadiene)(methoxy)iridium(I) dimer ([Ir(OMe)(COD)]2) [66]. They were firstly found to be active catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral ketones. The Ir NPs immobilized on Multi-Wall Carbon Nanotubes (Ir/MWCNTs) catalyzed the hydrogenation of pchloronitrobenzene to generate p-chloroaniline with the selectivity of 99.9% under room temperature and balloon hydrogen pressure in a methanol/water mixture [67]. Özkar et al. prepared the Ir NPs in FAU zeolite framework and investigated the catalytic activity of the Ir NPs for the hydrogenation of neat aromatics (benzene, toluene, o-xylene and mesitylene) by H2 under mild conditions [68]. These studies suggested that Ir nanomaterials play a pivotal role on the catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The catalytic activity of Ir nanomaterials is highly dependent on their structural properties, such as the size, morphology, and electron density of Ir."

The catalytic decomposition of hydrazine includes two sub-reactions: hydrazine is decomposed into ammonia and nitrogen, and ammonia is further decomposed into hydrogen and nitrogen [32]. The first reaction is a structure insensitive reaction and the second is a structure sensitive depending on the specific surface area of the nanosized Ir, volume and pore size distribution of support and H2 chemisorption. This reaction is accompanied by the release of heat and the temperature can reach approximately 1100 C. The produced H2 burn and pushed the spacecraft into the correct orbit.

The thermodynamic efficiency from electrochemical oxidation of small organic molecules is more than 70% while the CO2 emission remains low as well. Thus, the fuel cell reaction is a new avenue for the exploitation of clean energy to promote the sustainable development of society for reducing global environmental pollution [70–72]. The development of novel\ncatalyst is particularly important for effectively catalyzing the electrochemical oxidation of small molecules [73,74]. As early as 1987, the electrooxidation of methanol catalyzed by Ir was studied in H2SO4/HClO4 media, and the catalytic activity is higher than Pt catalyst at low positive potential regions [48]. Subsequently, Nafion was used as stabilizer for preparing monodispersed Ir NPs and studied the catalytic performance for fuel cells by directly fixing the Ir NPs onto the surface of electrode [3]. In order to improve the catalytic efficiency of fuel cell reaction, various Ir-based composite nanomaterials, such as Ir/Sn-SnO2 and IrRu composite nanoparticles with the average of 3 nm and 2.9–3.7 nm, were prepared [75,76]. Their catalytic performances for electrooxidation of ethanol were superior to Pt/C catalyst. The superior catalytic performance of binary alloy attributed to the bifunctional and electronic effects. The electronic structure of Ir was changed by the electronic back donation from Sn to Ir. The Ir-CO bond was weakened and the catalytic performance of Ir/Sn-SnO2 was improved [75]. For the IrRu transition metal binary system with a ratio of Ir/Ru close to 3:1, the three neighbouring Ir atoms may mitigate the poisoning by CO, facilitating the oxidation of ethanol. According to the DFT calculation, the CAC bond scission during the electrooxidation of ethanol was easier to carry out on the surface of IrRu composite compared to the Ir or Ru catalyst, suggesting the efficient catalytic performance of the IrRu composite [76]. Resort to the excellent catalytic activity of composite nanomaterials, IrPt [77], IrRh [78], PtSnIr and IrSn [79] nanomaterials have been developed and used for the catalytic oxidation of ethanol, formic acid and ammonia. The exploration of Ir or Ir-based composites catalysts will provide greater potentials and wider space for future development of clean energy."

The degradation of nitric oxide (NO) in automobile exhaust gas is very critical to improve the air quality. The electrochemical reduction of NO to N2 was studied 20 years ago under the catalytic action of an Ir cathode by Fedkiw et al. [80]. The NO was adsorbed on the surface of Ir cathode and thenwas catalytically decomposed. Meanwhile, the surface structure of Ir changed or the oxidation of Ir occurred to form IrO2. This considerably weakened the service life and recycle efficiency of Ir catalyst. The Ir/Al2O3 and Ir/SiO2 catalysts were prepared for the catalytic reduction of NO by propene under lean-burn conditions at 873 K while other potential reagent pollution was triggered at the harsh conditions [81]. Recently, the selective reduction of NO to N2 by C2H2 or CO on the surface of Ir nanomaterials has been reported [82]. The two reactions were structure-sensitive for the Ir nanomaterials. Both planar and faceted Ir(2 1 0) planes can adsorb and dissociate C2H2 to form acetylide (CCH) andH species, and further the NO is reduced selectively to N2 by C2H2-covered Ir. As CO is also one of the main compositions from automobile exhaust gas, whether or not Ir nanomaterials can directly catalyze the reduction of NO by CO in the tail gas is a direction to explore. This can avoid the introduction of other reaction reagent and improve the catalytic efficiency of Ir nanomaterials probably. This will be a significant topic for air purification."

Seong et al. prepared the Ir NPs modified with the single-walled carbon nanotube (Ir NPsSWCNT) film as electrode [28]. With high enzymatic activity for glucose electrooxidation under alkaline conditions, the Ir NPsSWCNT was also used as sensing for the determination of glucose. By using the catalytic electroreduction of H2O2 [43], the composite Ir/carbon film electrode was used as enzyme sensor for the determination of L-glutamate via measuring the H2O2 content produced in the oxidation of L-glutamate. As prepared in water-ethanol media, the Ir NPs stabilized with PVP exhibited the peroxidase activity to protect cells against H2O2-induced oxidative damage [85]. Song et al. further confirmed that the mimic peroxidase of Ir NPs was based on the change in electron density and the mobility in Ir NPs [86]. The Ir NPs capped with sodium citrate can catalyze dissolved oxygen oxidizing 3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to produce a blue product. The catalytic mechanism of the Ir NPs was ascribed to the production of the superoxide anion radical (O2 ), suggesting the oxidase-like activity of Ir NPs [87]. In spite of noble metal nanomaterial for enzyme mimics have exhibited prominent advantages comparing to natural enzyme, they still faced serious challenge, such as the low catalytic efficiency due to the coating action of stabilizer and limited selectivity for substrates.

Results showed the penetration and translocation were both controlled at the epithelial and endothelial level.

However, various issues still remain to be addressed in future including (i) the improvement of preparation strategies, (ii) the exploitation of structurally dependent properties and (iii) the expansion of applications. For some complex synthetic approaches including incipient wetness impregnation, sputtering method and preparation in ILs, it is known that the incipient wetness impregnation (toxic gas release) and sputtering method need harsh conditions of reaction while retaining low rate of production conversion while the preparation in ILs requires sophisticated reaction equipment for reducing Ir3+ precursor under high pressure H2. For simple one-pot synthetic approaches such as chemical/photochemical reduction and microwave-assisted synthesis can achieve the maximum utilization of reaction reagent by controlling reaction process at atomic level while reducing environmental pollution effectively. These avenues to improve synthetic strategies will greatly increase the potential value in the preparation of Ir nanomaterials. Meanwhile, there remain great challenges ahead in preparing Ir nanomaterials with different structures closely related to properties, which can extend not only diversified properties-bearing structures but also enhancing potential values of applications. Although the efficient catalytic activities of Ir nanomaterials have been widely used in the development of clean energy, tail gas purification and aerospace, the researches and applications on optical and electronic properties and mimetic enzyme activity are still rarely investigated.
