We demonstrate that morphology of the fabricated hybrid nanomaterials can be manipulated but the phases of those nanomaterials are still monoclinic and hexagonal hybrid structure via tuning the proportion of the reagents. The synthesis mechanism and the gas-sensing properties of the harvested nanomaterials have also been investigated.

      "text" : "Tungsten oxide nanomaterials have been extensively investigated due to the outstanding performances of gas sensitivity [1], photocatalysis [2], electrochromism [3] and so on. WO3 with nanostructures are promising the candidate materials for gas sensors to detect a variety of harmful gases (NH3 [4], H2S [5], NO2 [6], CH3OH [7] and so forth). The tungsten oxide nano materials with the specific sizes and morphologies were synthesized via various methods such as thermal oxidation method [8], hydrothermal method [9], electrochemical anodic oxidation method [10] and so on. Up to now, the WO3 nano materials (nano-wire [11], nano-rod [12], nano-sheet [13] and so forth) were synthesized successfully.\nGreat effort has been devoted to control the microstructure of WO3 to get the excellent gas-sensitivity [14,15]. Hierarchical architectures WO3∙H2O were successfully prepared and the relatively higher response is range from 100 to 600 ppm to ethanol at 350 C but the relatively lower response of them is below 100 ppm [16].\nof Mechanical Engineering,\nWO3 nano-plates were controllable synthesized and also show lower response of 50 ppm to ethanol [17]. Increasing the specific surface area is an effective way to enhance the gas sensitivity of nanoparticles. At the same time, the composition of nanomaterials is also a common method to improve the gas sensitivity [18e22].\nHere, we synthesize WO3 nano-particles with hybrid architectures via the facile hydrothermal process and investigate how the proportion of the reagents affects the morphology, underlying growth mechanism, and gas-sensitivity properties of synthesized WO3 nanomaterials at the low concentrations."

      "text" : "All used reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. First, 50mL of mixtures were prepared by deionized water, ethanol and cyclohexane with the proportions of 1:1:1, 1:1:2, 1:2:1 and 1:2:2 respectively. Next, 2mmol of sodium tungstate (Na2WO4$2H2O) and 7mmol of octadecylamine (C18H39N) was dispersed into each prepared mixture. The mixtures were stirred by a magnetic stirring apparatus. Then the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 0.8e0.9 by hydrochloric acid (HCl). After stirring 15 minutes, the solvent was transferred into the Teflon-\nlined stainless-steel autoclave and treated at 180 C for 24 h. Finally, the prepared nano-materials were washed by deionized water and alcohol to remove the unexpected ions by high-speed centrifugation, and then dried at 60 C for 12 h in air.\nMicrostructure analyses were performed using XRD and FESEM. For the XRD, a Rigaku D/Max-1200X diffractometry with the Cu Ka radiation operated at 30 kV and 100mA was used. Surface morphologies of the samples were observed using the FE-SEM (JSM-7800F, JEOL CO. Ltd.). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) operated at an accelerating voltage 200 kV [23,24].\nThe process of gas sensor fabrication and gas sensing test as follow: the homogeneous suspensions were prepared by WO3 nano-materials and deionized water, then pasted them on commercial ceramic substrates with Ag-Pd interdigitated electrodes to form films with the thickness of 1mme2mm and dried at 55 C in air to form a solid pasted film. The gas sensor was put on a heating plate in the test chamber by pressing firmly with two probes.\nWe tested the gas sensing properties of the sensors using the CGS-1TP instrument (Fig. 1). The gas sensing measurements were conducted with the prepared sensors at different operation temperatures and humidity with a fixed working voltage of 9 V. The operation temperature was changed by heating system controller under heating ceramic platewith the rate of 3e5 C/s. The humidity is 10e60%. The sensor was preheated at certain target temperature until the resistance of thematerials reached a steady state, and then\nFig. 1. Schematic of the CG\nwas sealed in the test chamber. The target gas was injected into the test chamber. After gas sensing tests, the test chamber was opened to make the sensor expose to the fresh air. The sensor resistance and sensitivity were also collected and analyzed by the data acquisition system. These procedures were repeated for the gas sensing tests at different conditions. Here, the sensitivity of the sensor is defined as S ¼ Ra/Rg, where Ra and Rg are the resistances of sensor in air and target gas, respectively [25].\nThe BrunauereEmmetteTeller (BET) was measured on Micrometrics ASAP 2020. The vacuum-dried samples were treated at 70 C for 6 h under vacuum before analysis.\n3. Results and discussion\nTo determine the crystal phase textures of the samples, XRD analysis is conducted, as shown in Fig. 2, where textural orientations of the detected matters are shown as well for easy reference. Upon close indexing, the diffraction peaks are identified as the monoclinic-WO3 (JCPDS NO. 72-1465) and the hexagonal-WO3 (JCPDS NO. 75-2187). These indicate that the proportion of deionized water, ethanol and cyclohexane have no impact on the crystal phase textures of the final products.\nFig. 3 presents field-emission SEM micrographs of the assynthesized WO3, where we can see that the proportion of reagent composition is the key factors that influence the morphology\nS-1TP analysis system.\nof the nanocrystals in the hydrothermal synthesis process. Fig. 3(a) shows morphology of the sample prepared at the ratio of 1:1:1 (deionized H2O/C2H6O/C6H12), where one can see a hybrid architecture comprising two different types of particles: small particles and hexahedron sheets. The hexahedron sheet-shaped WO3 have the edge length of ~500 nm and the thickness of ~20 nm. The nanoparticles with irregular shape absorbed on the surfaces of the WO3 nano hexahedron sheets. When the ratio increases 1:1:2, the sizes of the nano-sheets increase and the shapes become irregular (Fig. 3(b)). In addition, small particles grow into nanorods with the length less than 100 nm. The cube-like shaped WO3 nano-crystals are obtained (Fig. 3(c)) at the molar ratio of deionized H2O/ C2H6O/C6H12 as 1:2:1. The sizes ofWO3 nano-cubes are not uniform and the agglomeration is serious. A small number of nanoparticles are adsorbed to the surface of the nano-cubes. In addition, some thicker sheets are observed. When the ratio of deionized H2O/ C2H6O/C6H12 reaches 1:2:2, sheets with large scale are obtained, and a large number of nano-rods and other small nano-particles are randomly attached to the surface of the sheets (Fig. 3 (d)).\nTo investigate the micro-structure of the synthesized nanoparticles, TEM analysis are conducted. From Fig. 4(a), the edge length of the hexahedron sheet-shaped WO3 nano-particle is ~500 nm and the angle between the adjacent sides is 120 . The corresponding selected-area diffraction (SAED) also identifies that the WO3 nano-sheet is the hexagonal structure (Fig. 4(c)). TEM(HRTEM) image is taken from the corner area of the hexagonal nano-sheet as shown in Fig. 4(b). The lattice spacing of the WO3 nano-sheet is determined to be ~0.63 nm, in line with the distance between the (100) planes of the WO3.\nFig. 5 (a) shows a low-magnification TEM image of a hybrid architecture synthesized by the ratio of deionized H2O/C2H6O/C6H12 as 1:1:2 comprising of hexagonal nano-sheets, rods and small particles. Fig. 5 (b) shows a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of corner area of WO3 nano-rod, the lattice spacing of the WO3 nanorod is determined to be ~0.36 nm, in line with the distance between (200) planes of WO3. From the SAED (Fig. 5 (c)), the nano-rod is confirmed to be the monoclinic WO3. The small particles with an average size of ~2 nm are adsorbed to the surface of the nano-sheet\n(Fig. 5(d)). The HRTEM image of an individual WO3 nano-sheet is shown in Fig. 5(e), from which the distance between the clearly resolved 2D lattice planes is determined to be ~0.39 nm, very close to the {001} lattice spacing of the hexagonal WO3 phase. By taking the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the HRTEM image, the structure of the WO3 is verified to be the hexagonal crystal system (Fig. 5(f)).\nFig. 6(a) shows the typical bright-field images, which confirm that the nanoparticles synthesized by the deionized H2O/C2H6O/ C6H12 ratio of 1:2:1 are of cubic shape and no uniform size. Fig. 6(b) presents a HRTEM image taken around the corner of a nano-cube. Lattice spacing of two groups of perpendicular lattice fringes is determined to be ~0.38 nm, in accord with that of the WO3 (002) planes. In addition, the (002) and (020) diffraction spots are also detected, which arise from other surfaces of a nano-cube (Fig. 6(c)).\nFig. 7(a) shows a bright-field TEM image of the hybrid architecture of the hexagonal nano-sheets, rods synthesized by the ratio of deionized H2O/C2H6O/C6H12 as 1:2:2. The HRTEM image is taken from the corner area of the nano-sheet (Fig. 7(a)), as shown in Fig. 7(b), from which the lattice spacing is determined to be ~0.632 nm, in line with that of the (100) plane of WO3. Fig. 7(c) presents a fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the HRTEM image, from which the structure of WO3 nano-sheet is identified to be the hexagonal crystal structure. Fig. 7(d) shows typical HRTEMimages taken at a corner of a rod, fromwhich lattice spacing is determined to be~0.364 nm, in line with that of the (200) planes of WO3.\nIn view of the observations, we propose that the proportion of ethanol and cyclohexane plays a crucial role in the growth of nanomaterials. First, the Na2WO4$2H2O is ionized under deionized water in the water phase, resulting in the formation ofWO42 . There is one thing to be emphasized that Hþ ion fromHCl is give the acidic environment. Then, theWO42 ion is adsorbed with -NH2 functional group which is from octadecylamine in the organic phase, forming the WO42 -6C18H37NH2 suspension [26]. During the hightemperature and high-pressure hydrothermal process, WO42 - 6C18H37NH2 suspension decomposes, giving rise to the nucleation of WO3 [27e29], and formed the hexagonal-WO3 and monoclinicWO3. The structure of the hexagonal-WO3 and monoclinic-WO3 as shown in Fig. 8 (a) and (b).\nThe formation process can be described as follows:\nNa2WO4$2H2O / 2Na þ þ WO2 4 þ 2H2O (1)\nHCl/ Hþ þ Cl (2)\n6C18H37NH2 þ WO2 4 /WO2 4 6C18H37NH2 (3)\nWO2 4 6C18H37NH2 þ 2Hþ /WO3 þ 6C18H37NH2 þH2O (4)\nFig. 8 (c) illustrates schematical evolution of the WO3\nnanoparticles in the hybrid system. Increasing the concentration of octadecylamine is beneficial to the directional growth of small particles into nano-rods (Fig. 3(b) and (d)). With the increase of ethanol concentration, the sheets tend to grow towards the nanocubes (Fig. 3(c) and (d)).\nFig. 9 shows the gas response of the sensor based on WO3 nanomaterials to volatile organic compound (VOC) testing gases, including NH3, C6H6, C2H5OH, CH3COCH3 and HCHO. All of the gases were tested at an operating temperature of 350 C with a concentration of 35 ppm. In Fig. 9, the results indicate that the sensor exhibited little responses to NH3, C6H6, and HCHO, and were almost insensitive to C2H5OH and CH3COCH3. The highest response of the sensor was 32.1 to ethanol, while the responses to other gases were\nno greater than 12. It is concluded that this sensor fabricated by WO3 nanomaterials with hybrid architectures can be used effectively to detect alcohol.\nFig. 10 shows the gas-sensing response of the nanomaterials at different working temperatures ranging from 250 to 450 C under the ethanol concentration of 35 ppm. Obviously, the gas response\nincreased at the temperature as low as 350 C, and then gradually decreased with further increasing temperature. Thus, the optimal working temperature is set at 350 C for further gas-sensing\nmeasurements of the WO3 sensor. We examine the effect of humidity on gas sensitivity of sample\nwhich is the most sensitive to alcohol under the concentration of\n35 ppm and working temperature is 350 C (Fig. 11). The gas response drops off slowly at the humidity as low as 30%, and then gradually decreased with increasing humidity. Fig. 12 shows the response and recovery time for the four sensors to the ethanol gas of 35 ppm and humidity of 30% at 350 C. The response and recovery time was defined as the interval between when response reached 90% of its maximum and dropped to 10% of its maximum. Upon closer inspection, we find that the response and recovery time of all samples are similar is ~52 and 34 s. In addition, the gas response for the sensor fabricated by WO3 nanomaterials to the C2H5OH is estimated to be 24.48 (1:1:1), 30.24 (1:1:2), 21.20 (1:2:1), 32.10 (1:2:2) respectively. Table 1 summarizes the ethanol sensing performances of our WO3 sample sensor and those sensors reported in the literatures [30e41]. The gas-sensitive response of our sensor is much higher than that of other metal oxide sensors such as V2O5 [30], NiO [31], a-MoO3/a-Fe2O3 [32]. As for the reported tungsten oxide sensor [33e38], our sensors also exhibits high response under the lower ethanol concentration(<50 ppm). Based on an overall consideration, our WO3 sensor in this work has more advantages and will be a potential advanced sensing material for C2H5OH detection. Significantly, with the doping of Ag, the AgWO3 sensor [39e41] displays better sensing properties than ours. Therefore, our future work is to enhance the sensing properties via metal doping [39e41], oxide doping [42], irradiation [40,41] and so on.\nThe sensor shows a nearly constant response to 35 ppm ethanol in one week. The fluctuation range of gas sensitivity is less than 5% which indicates that the sensor has a good stability throughout the cyclic test (Fig. 13).\nGrain size, surface state, oxygen adsorption quantity, active energy of oxygen adsorption and lattice defects are the factors influencing the gas-sensing properties [43]. The BET surface areas are 6.5014, 9.0766, 6.1463 and 10.4039m2/g corresponding to the samples prepared via the ratios of deionized H2O/C2H6O/C6H12 are 1:1:1, 1:1:2, 1:2:1 and 1:2:2, respectively. The WO3 nanomaterials synthesized via the ratios of deionized H2O/C2H6O/C6H12 as 1:2:2 have the highest value of gas response due to the largest BET surface area exposed to gas. However, the specific surface area of the particles (synthesized via the ratio of deionized H2O/C2H6O/C6H12 is 1:2:1) is the lowest due to severe agglomeration, the responses to the gases are the weakest. Electrons in the tungsten oxide could be caught by oxygen to form adsorbed oxygen species (O , O2 ) so that the sensor exhibit a high resistance in air, electron depletions are\nTable 1 Comparison of gas-sensing characteristics of ethanol sensors based on various nanomaterials.\nMaterials Working temp( C) Concentration(ppm) Response Res/Rec time(s) Reference\nTi-coated V2O5 nanobelts 200 100 2 49/85 [30] W(2 at%)-doped NiO 375 200 8.7 178/152 [31] a-MoO3/a-Fe2O3 206 100 6.8 87/190 [32] WO3 nanosheets 300 100 4.8 19.8/20.2 [33] WO3 nanoflowers 250 100 16.2 34.2/35.6 [33] WO3 nanoplates 300 50 4.5 / [34] h-WO3 nanowires 300 10 10 6-8/6-8 [35] 3D WO3 nanospheres 250 100 17.54 / [36] WO3 particles 300 100 12.2 9-11/9-10 [37] WO3$H2O nanoflowers 350 300 25 17/30 [38] Ag(15nm)-WO3 hollow nanospheres 230 50 46.39 / [39] Agx@(2D-WO3) core-shell nanostructure 340 100 200 2/5 [40] Ag-WO3core-shell nanospheres 190 50 60 26/35 [41] WO3 nanomaterials (hybrid architecture) 350 35 31 54/32 this work\nformed on the surface of the tungsten oxide and the surface band bending increase.

We focus especially on the impact of the proportion of reaction reagent on the growth of WO3 nano-crystals and find that the morphology of the final nanoparticles can be tuned efficiently by adjusting the proportion of deionizedwater, ethanol and cyclohexane, but have no impact on the crystal phase textures of the final products. In addition, the gas sensing measurements reveal that the sensor made of such hybrid architectures of WO3 nano-particles show sensitivity as high as ~32 to the ethanol of 35 ppm at the optimal temperature 350 C, and also exhibit excellent selectivity and stability respectively which can use as promising sensor materials detecting ethanol with low concentration.\nAcknowledgements\nZ.J thanks the financial support by the Project of Research Study and Creativity Experiment Plan for College Students of the Hunan province (Education Department of Hunan Province Bulletin grant no.

We demonstrate that morphology of the fabricated hybrid nanomaterials can be manipulated but the phases of those nanomaterials are still monoclinic and hexagonal hybrid structure via tuning the proportion of the reagents. The synthesis mechanism and the gas-sensing properties of the harvested nanomaterials have also been investigated. The as prepared WO3 nano-particles with hybrid architectures exhibit excellent gas-sensing functions to ethanol gas at the optimal temperature as low as 350 C under the low concentration of 35 ppm, rendering them a promising sensing material for the on-site detection of ethanol. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
