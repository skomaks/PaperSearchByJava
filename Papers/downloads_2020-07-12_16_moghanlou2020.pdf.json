This study focuses on the effect of graphite nano-flakes addition on the microstructure, densification, and thermal characteristics of TiB2–25 vol% SiC composite. The samples were manufactured through spark plasma sintering process under the sintering conditions of 1800 °C/7 min/40 MPa. Scanning electron microscopy images demonstrated a homogenous dispersion of graphite flakes within the TiB2–SiC composite causing a betterment in the densification process. The thermal diffusivity of the specimens was gained via the laser flash technique. The addition of graphite nano-flakes as a dopant in TiB2–SiC did not change the thermal diffusivity. Consequently, the remarkable thermal conductivity of TiB2–SiC remained intact. It seems that the finer grains and more interfaces obstruct the heat flow in TiB2–SiC–graphite composites. Adding a small amount of graphite nano-flakes enhances the densification of the mentioned composite by preventing the grain growth."

      "text" : "Ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) can generally tolerate very high temperatures (up to 2500 °C) because of their high melting point and ability to form refractory oxide materials [1–5]. Among the UHTCs, diboride-based ceramics e.g. titanium diboride (TiB2), zirconium diboride (ZrB2), and hafnium diboride (HfB2) offer fabulous features for the utilization in hypersonic re-entry spacecraft, gas turbine blades, and heat exchanger plates [6–15]. Titanium diboride-based composites are very appropriate for harsh working conditions and applications involving high temperatures. Consequently, they have recently attracted considerable attention because of their unique properties [16]. The modified TiB2 composites have demonstrated inimitable features such as great melting point (3225 °C), relatively low density (4.52 g/cm3), excellent mechanical properties (hardness 25–35 GPa, Young's modulus ~560 GPa, high strength at room temperature), high electrical and thermal properties (remarkable thermal\nconductivity of 60–120 W/m-K), and relatively low thermal expansion coefficient [17–29]. Because of such incomparable properties, TiB2 composites possess a wide range of technological applications in various industries including cutting tools, particulate reinforcements in composites, grain refiner, electrodes in metal smelting, and wear-resistant parts [30–33]. In composite materials, investigating the mechanical and physical properties are very necessary to achieve the requirements for each application. In addition, thermal properties have notable influence on the performance and efficiency of different equipment, in particular, cutting tools. Because UHTCs are generally use in high temperature circumstances, knowing their thermal properties is indispensable to determine the temperature distribution in the material for each specific application [34–37]. In general, the materials with higher thermal diffusivity values provide more uniform temperature distribution [38]. On the other hand, numerical simulations [39–42], mathematical modelings [43–46] or optimization in engineering applications [47,48] need some experimental material\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.192 Received 9 December 2019; Received in revised form 18 January 2020; Accepted 19 January 2020\n∗ Corresponding author. ∗∗ Corresponding author.

However, shortages such as low fracture toughness and feeble flexural strength confine the applications of TiB2. In practice, due to the trifle self-diffusion coefficient and high level of impurities, monolithic TiB2 can be sintered difficultly at temperatures lower than 2000 °C [50]. In addition, the formation of oxide impurities on the surface of the produce ceramics has a detrimental influence on the densification phenomenon [51]. Among commonly applicable sintering methods, spark plasma sintering (SPS) is considered as an efficient method to manufacture ceramics at low temperatures in a short process time [52–63]. Zhang et al. [50] produced monolithic TiB2 ceramics having a relative density of 97.6% by sintering it at 1800 °C under load of 50 MPa. The flexural strength, hardness and fracture toughness values of the sintered ceramics were 538 ± 45 MPa, 29.6 ± 2.5 GPa and 5.2 ± 0.4 MPa m1/2, respectively.\nIn general, high sintering temperature causes unusual grain growth and micro-cracks in the produced ceramics deteriorating the desired densification and mechanical features [64]. Hence, various additives such as boride components are applied for the production of TiB2 composites [65]. Additive materials are divided into two major groups: metallic and non-metallic. Eliminating the oxide impurity to improve the sinterability and mechanical properties as well as affecting densification process is the primary role of these additive materials. Metallic additives generally melt below 1200 °C providing contact points and interfaces between grains boundaries by filling in the open spaces/ pores of the piece during the manufacturing process. Although these strategies improve the densification of material, the use of metallic additives has unfavorable influence on high-temperature applications after the densification process. Thus, non-metallic additives are commonly utilized to promote the sinterability and toughness of TiB2, at higher temperatures [66]. For example, it has been shown that the application of sintering aids such as silicon carbide (SiC) is a suitable choice to overcome the aforementioned problems. SiC has appreciable characteristics including low thermal expansion, great hardness, and thermal conductivity, high resistance to corrosion, and maintaining of elastic resistance at elevated temperatures (upper than 1650 °C) [67–70]. SiC is also used in different applications such as bearings, pump components, automotive water pump seals, and extrusion dies. SiC particles can augment both the densification process and the fracture toughness of TiB2-based ceramics by eliminating the oxide impurities and preventing the grain growth [17]. It should be noted that to improve the microstructure and densification behavior of the produced ceramics, controlling the content of SiC is necessary. Sabahi et al. [17] examined the effect of different amounts of SiC on the mechanical features of hot-pressed TiB2. The utilization of the secondary phase of SiC improved the mechanical features of UHTCs-based ceramics.\nSeveral studies reported the application carbon-based additives as dopant of composite materials [25,26,34,71–79]. Carbon-based additives generally promote the thermo-mechanical properties of materials due to their better toughening mechanisms. Nanoscale form of carbon materials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) have been proposed as additive aids recently [80]. Moreover, the benefits of using nanostructured carbon materials in aerospace applications have been indicated by NASA's nano-technology road map in a few past decades [81]. Graphene-based materials possess excellent electrical, mechanical, and thermal features, therefore, they have been utilized as reinforcement of ceramics [34,73]. Akin et al. [82] examined the microstructures and properties of graphene containing TiB2–SiC composites under the different content of graphene nano-platelets. They observed that increasing the amount of graphene leads to deterioration in mechanical properties. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes can be added to a metal, ceramic or polymer matrix as an excellent candidate to improve the properties of composites [83,84]. Lin et al. [85] studied the characteristics of TiB2–15vol% CNT sample manufactured by hot-pressing at 1900 °C and 2 h dwelling time. Although the fracture toughness value was achieved maximally to\n6.7 ± 0.9 MPa m1/2, the high temperature and long holding time in the hot-pressed method had an undesirable effect on the performance of CNTs.\nAnother example is graphite flakes having unique features including great melting point, excellent strength, high fracture toughness, and good thermal shock resistance. Furthermore, the layered structure of graphite and the weak forces between the layers, permit this material to be a good lubricant [86,87]. These intrinsic characteristics make it an ideal candidate to be utilized in machinery and metallurgy fields [88,89]. There are several articles investigated graphite flakes in ZrB2–SiC composites and the relevant effect on physico-mechanical properties of the produced ceramics. Zhang and colleagues [90] examined the influence of 10 vol% graphite flake on the mechanical characteristics of hot-pressed ZrB2–20 vol% SiC samples. They reported that adding graphite could improve the fracture toughness of the samples, while hardness and flexure strength were reduced slightly. The thermal shock treatment and microstructure of ZrB2–SiC composite doped with graphite and fabricated via the hot-pressed method was studied by Wang and co-workers [91]. They used a water-quenching method to examine the thermal shock behavior of the samples. They found that the flexural strength of the graphite-free sample decreases sharply at temperatures ~400 °C. In another research, Shahedi Asl et al. [74] investigated the influence of nano-graphite addition on the mechanical characteristics and densification process of ZrB2–25 vol% SiC sample. It was shown that the oxide layers on the surface of raw materials were removed by adding graphite nano-flakes improving the sinterability process. In addition, the influence of the different amounts of graphite (0–10 wt% of the matrix) on the densification behavior of samples was examined. A fully dense composite was achieved by the addition of 5 wt% nano-graphite under the SPS condition of 1900 °C/ 7 min/40 MPa. Wang et al. [92] studied the effect of graphite nanoflake on microstructure and thermal shock resistance of hot-pressed ZrB2–SiC composites. It was observed that the relative density value of ZrB2–SiC can be enhanced ~0.5% (99.7%–100.2%) by increasing the amount of graphite flakes from 10 vol% to 15 vol%. Hou et al. [93] examined the influence of graphite flake diameter on thermal shock behavior and mechanical features of ZrB2–20 vol% nano SiC–20vol% micro graphite samples. The experimental results indicated that the relative density of the samples was first enhanced and then reduced with raising the diameter of graphite. Indeed, along with the efficient parameters on the densification process such as dwell time and external applied load, the sintering temperature plays the most crucial role [94]. Generally, the hot-pressed samples require higher sintering temperatures than specimens prepared by SPS and show higher relative density values.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the effect of graphite nano-flakes on thermo-mechanical features of TiB2–SiC sample has not been investigated so far. Because TiB2 and ZrB2 are similar in the densification process and based on the good influence of adding graphite on the features of ZrB2-based samples, it is asserted that the addition of nanographite as a dopant can enhance the densification and the properties of TiB2–SiC composite. Hence, the effect of adding 2 wt% graphite nanoflake on thermal features and microstructures of TiB2–25vol% SiC composite has been studied. SPS procedure with the conditions of 1800 °C/7 min/40 MPa was selected foro fabricating the specimens. In order to obtain thermal properties, the laser flash technique was used."

      "text" : "Commercially available TiB2 powder (purity> 99.9%, size of 3–8 μm, Xuzhou Hongwu Co., China), ultrafine SiC powder (purity> 99%, size of 500 nm, Xuzhou Hongwu Co., China), and the graphite nano-flake powder (purity> 99.5%, size< 100 nm Xuzhou Hongwu Co., China) were used as initial materials for producing TiB2–SiC and\nTiB2–SiC–graphite composites. The raw powders were blended with an appropriate proportion of 13 g TiB2 as matrix plus 3.077 g (25 vol% of the matrix) SiC as reinforcement. In addition, for the graphite-containing sample, 0.26 g graphite nano-flakes (2 wt% of the matrix) were added as a dopant. Initially, the blended powders of TiB2 and SiC with the aforementioned proportion of graphite nano-flakes were separately dispersed, and ultra-sonicated for half an hour (WUC-D10H, Daihan, Korea). For the graphite-containing sample, after adding TiB2–SiC suspension to the graphite nano-flakes suspension, the final mixture was put into the ultrasonic bath for an additional 1 h. Then, the wet mixtures of TiB2–SiC and TiB2–SiC plus graphite nano-flake were put on a magnetic stirrer hot plate (MR 3001k, Heidolph, Germany) for 4 h. The slurry form of these mixtures kept in an oven (Memmert Universal Oven Um, Germany) at the temperature of 120 °C for 20 h until complete ethanol removal. The prepared mixtures were loaded into a graphite die and covered with thin graphite layers. The resulting powder mixtures were synthesized through SPS (Nanozint 10i, Khalapoushan Felez Co., Iran) at 1800 °C for 7 min under the uniaxial pressure of 40 MPa in a vacuum atmosphere. Eventually, two disc-shaped composites with a diameter of ~25 mm and a thickness of ~5 mm were manufactured."

      "text" : "Before characterizations, the surface of both samples was ground and polished with a diamond paste to remove any graphite contamination. The microstructures and fracture surfaces of the sintered composites were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss Ultra Plus, Carl Zeiss International, Germany). Phase analysis in the starting powders and the sintered composites were specified by an Xray diffractometer (XRD, D8 Advance Bruker, Germany). The average grain size of TiB2–SiC and TiB2–SiC–graphite specimens was ascertained by measuring ~80 grains and utilizing an image analyzing software (ImageJ 1.52a, Wayne Rasband). Moreover, an HSC chemistry software (Outokumpu Research Oy, Finland) was applied to define the thermodynamical assessment of the reactions between different components. The bulk density of the mentioned composites was specified by the Archimedes principle, and rule of mixtures was applied for calculating the theoretical density. The relative density was measured regarding the ratio of bulk density to the theoretical density of each sample. In addition, the pure density values of three components (TiB2, SiC, and graphite) were 4.52, 3.21 and 2.25 g/cm3, respectively [66,95,96]. For examining heat transfer or thermal related issues, the thermal conductivity of a material is the most important parameter as it is formulated in Eq. (1).\n=k αρc (1)\nWhere k shows thermal conductivity ( − W m K ). c, ρ and α represent the specific heat capacity (\n− ° J kg C ), bulk density ( kg m3 ) and thermal diffusivity\n(m s 2 ) of material, respectively. As mentioned earlier, bulk density can be determined by Archimedes principle, and rule of mixture was used to calculate the heat capacity. The thermal diffusivity, as the ratio of the amount of conducted heat to stored heat in material, can be measured by several methods. In the present work, the measurement of the thermal diffusivity of both specimens was carried out using the laser flash technique (LFA 467 HT HyperFlash, Netzsch, Germany). The laser flash method can be run on composites, porous, layered, and powder samples [97]. At first, a standard sample with a thickness of 1 mm and a dimension of 1 × 1 cm2 was prepared by wire cut machining (Fig. 1). Then, the obtained sample was heated by an instantaneous laser beam on one side only, and a temperature gradient was created and propagated through the sample. On the other side, a detector registered the time-dependent temperature gradient and reported the thermal diffusivity after each laser pulse [98]."

      "text" : "The XRD patterns of the TiB2–SiC and TiB2–SiC–graphite samples were collected after surface polishing for the phase analyses. SEM micrographs were used to observe the microstructure, morphology, and grain size of the specimens. The relative density of both samples sintered at 1800 °C under the load of 40 MPa for 7 min were obtained as 95.5% (for TiB2–SiC) and 96% (for TiB2–SiC–graphite). It is evident that the utilization of graphite nano-flake caused a trifling improvement in the densification process. The influence of adding carbon fiber on the microstructure and thermo-mechanical characteristics of TiB2–SiC has been reported in our previously published article [99]. Fig. 2 depicts the variation of the relative density of TiB2–SiC composite after the addition of several carbon additives. As it can be seen in Fig. 2, adding a small amount of carbon fibers enhanced the relative density of TiB2–SiC sample to 98.5%, whereas it did not affect the densification behavior significantly.\nThe uniform dispersion of nano-particles in the composite matrix is difficult and the agglomeration of nano-scale powders should be modified by surface treatments. Carbon fibers with 2 mm length were dispersed much better within the TiB2–SiC composite and caused better densification in comparison with graphite nano-flakes.\nXRD patterns of TiB2–SiC and TiB2–SiC–graphite samples are presented in Fig. 3a–b, respectively. XRD analyses show that the TiB2 and SiC are the predominant phases of both as-sintered composites. On the other hand, the trace of graphite as the second additive and some other phases e.g. TiC, B4C, and SiO2 are evident in Fig. 3. The reason of existing graphite in Fig. 3b can simply be explained because graphite nano-flakes were used as dopant. The formation of the other aforementioned phases was attributed to the reactions between the main phases (TiB2 and SiC) and the oxide impurities of starting powders.\nOxide impurities including TiO2 and B2O3 on the outer surface of TiB2 and the protective oxide layer of SiO2 on the surface of SiC powders have some disadvantages for the prepared composites. They can hinder the densification process and increase the grain growth, which lead to the formation of the pores in the sintered sample [17]. During the SPS process, some reactions between such impurities and starting materials (TiB2, SiC, and graphite flakes) can occur. It seems that graphite nanoflakes help the sintering process by removing these impurities according to the following reactions:\n+ = +SiO C SiC CO g3 2 ( )2 (2)\n+ = +TiO C TiC CO g3 2 ( )2 (3)\n+ = +B O C B C CO g2 7 6 ( )2 3 4 (4)\nThese three interfacial reactions are thermodynamically possible at temperatures over 1522 °C, 1288 °C, and 1567 °C, respectively [99]. Because the samples experience the temperature of 1800 °C in the sintering stages, occurring these reactions are favorable at the aforementioned temperatures. Based on Eqs. (2)–(4), the surface impurities were converted to carbon monoxide and the other visible phases according to XRD patterns. Interestingly, the carbon monoxides were escaped from the SPS device because of the vacuum atmosphere of sintering. Therefore, by eliminating oxide impurities from the surface of raw powders, the densification behavior was improved and reached the value of 96%. On the other hand, the existence of TiC, B4C, and SiO2 phases in XRD spectra may be attributed to the reaction of SiC particles with the impurities of TiB2 (TiO2 and B2O3) according to Eqs. (5) and (6).\n+ = +TiO SiC TiC SiO2 2 (5)\n+ = + +B O g SiC B C SiO g CO g4 ( ) 7 2 7 ( ) 5 ( )2 3 4 (6)\nAfter checking the possibility of these two reactions by HSC chemistry software, it is proven that Eq. (5) can occur at any temperature. However, Eq. (6) is thermodynamically favorable at temperatures more than 1866 °C.\nThe SEM micrographs of polished surface and fractured surface of both samples (TiB2–SiC and TiB2–SiC–graphite) are presented in Figs. 4 and 5. The microstructure of both composites is characterized by the gray phase of TiB2 and the dark phase of SiC particles (Figs. 4a and 5a). In addition, the long and slender slots are graphite flakes, which are indicated by the black phase in the TiB2–SiC–graphite sample (Fig. 5a). Graphite is a soft material and due to its weak bonding during the polishing process, some graphite flakes are pulled out from the composite. Because a few flakes of graphite were visible on the SEM images of graphite-additive composite, it can be claimed that Eqs. (2)–(4) occurred. According to Fig. 5a, the black regions are allocated to the parts of graphite nano-flakes, which have not reacted with other components. The existence of the graphite phase in XRD pattern of TiB2–SiC–graphite composite verifies the reason for the observation of these black areas. It seems that graphite flakes need more additional time or temperature to react completely with the other phases. As it can be seen in Fig. 5a, the outer regions of graphite flakes started to react and transform to other phases. Besides the block slots of graphite, there are some other dispersed black round parts in Figs. 4a and 5a indicating presence of porosity in the samples. The amount of porosity is a bit lower in TiB2–SiC–graphite than TiB2–SiC composite. It can be noticed that using graphite nano-flakes results in a denser sample with fewer\npores inside the piece (about 4%). This statement is verified with the enhancement of relative density values by adding graphite flakes (95.5%–96%). Furthermore, the particles of TiB2–SiC and TiB2–SiC–graphite samples are uniformly dispersed with the average grain sizes of about 1.9 μm and 1.5 μm, respectively. Therefore, it seems that the addition of a little amount of graphite nano-flakes promotes the densification process, and subsequently the sinterability of the composites. There are two types of fracture modes for grains: I) transgranular, in which the grain itself fractures, and II) intergranular, in which fracture happens in the grains boundary. Based on Figs. 4b and 5b, a mixed fracture mode of grains containing both transgranular and intergranular types can be seen in TiB2–SiC and TiB2–SiC–graphite composites. It worth noting that a transgranular fracture mode has been reported for monolithic TiB2, which changes to the multiplex fracture mode after adding silicon carbide as reinforcement and graphite as dopant [17].\nThermal conductivity as the material's ability to dissipate heat was calculated according to Eq. (1). Thermal diffusivity represents the ratio of heat conduction to the heat storage in the material. Increased thermal conductivity leads to a higher rate of heat transfer in any material. The transient technique of laser flash was utilized to specify the thermal diffusivity while bulk density and heat capacity of samples were obtained via the rule of mixture. Among three modes of heat transfer in a dense ceramic or composite, the main mechanisms of heat transfer in possible pores are conduction and radiation [100,101]. However, for highly porous materials, the convection mode through a gas medium inside the gaps should be taken into account [102]. Therefore, in the prepared TiB2–SiC and TiB2–SiC–graphite samples with a few pores of ~4%, the convection mechanism can be ignored. The thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity for TiB2–SiC and TiB2–SiC–graphite samples are shown in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. In addition, a comparison of thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity between these two samples in this study and our previously reported\ncarbon fiber composite [99] are presented in Figs. 6 and 7. The reduction of thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity by increasing the temperature can be observed clearly. The thermal conductivity of metals depends on free electrons motion and when the temperature increases the molecular vibrations can be intensified. Therefore, they obstruct the flow of free electrons and result in diminishing thermal conductivity [103]. In ceramics or composite materials, the reason for reduction can be related to other elements, including the amount of porosity, grain boundaries, and impurities [104,105]. Because air with the lowest thermal conductivity of ~0.01 W/m-K can be entrapped in pores, it acts as an insulator. Thus, the more porosity content in the material, the lower thermal conductivity can be obtained in the sample. It worth mentioning that besides the porosity content of the sample, size, shape, and orientation of the pores affect the thermal conductivity significantly [104]. The heat transfer through pores can be enhanced as the pores of the material become coarser. On the other hand, crystalline nature, lattice imperfections, and structure of the ceramic materials have considerable influence on thermal conductivity [106]. The higher or lower values of thermal conductivity are achieved in ceramics with finer sizes by examining the mentioned elements. In materials with a crystalline structure, any small change (whether chemical or physical) causing distortion in the lattice of the material decreases the thermal conductivity of the sample. Lattice vibrations are barricaded to pass the heat flow by increasing disorder; thus, thermal conductivity drops with increasing temperature. The temperature dependence relation of thermal conductivity in crystalline phases is described as [104]:\n= + + k αT β 1 γ T (7)\nwhere α, β and γ are considered constant and depend on the type of materials. The same results have already been demonstrated for carbon fiber-containing samples based on Figs. 6 and 7 [99]. It was understood\nthat the plots initially decrease with a sharp slope. Then, as the temperature gets higher, the thermal conductivity values tend to be constant. The lattice vibration in solid materials is changed with temperature elevation. However, increasing the temperature does not significantly affect lattice vibration and the thermal conductivity of the material [103,104,107]. Considering Figs. 6 and 7, adding a small amount of graphite nano-flakes deteriorates the thermal conductivity of the TiB2–SiC sample slightly. In order to explain the reason for this reduction, it is needed to use the SEM images of both samples (TiB2–SiC and TiB2–SiC–graphite). According to Figs. 4 and 5, the sample containing graphite has finer grain size with more interfaces than TiB2–SiC composite. Therefore, these grain boundaries cause thermal resistance by trapping the heat flow and heat conduction reduces. It can be seen that, the reduction in thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity of TiB2–SiC–graphite, and TiB2–SiC–Cf composites is not significant. The slight decrease in thermal conductivity of the TiB2–SiC sample by addition of the graphite nano-flakes can be attributed by the smaller grain size of the TiB2–SiC-graphite sample."

The results indicated that using graphite nano-flake as a dopant improved the densification process. Uniform dispersion of graphite flakes within the TiB2–SiC sample in conjunction with finer grains could be seen in SEM micrographs. The laser flash technique was applied to determine the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of samples. The plot of thermal conductivity versus temperature showed that increasing the\ntemperature causes a reduction in the thermal conductivity of both composites (TiB2–SiC and TiB2–SiC–graphite samples). Moreover, the addition of graphite nano-flakes decreased the thermal conductivity of TiB2–SiC composite slightly. It seems that grain boundaries of TiB2–SiC–graphite sample decreased the thermal conductivity by creating thermal resistance and preventing the heat flow since the average size of the grains were measured as 1.9 μm and 1.5 μm for TiB2–SiC and TiB2–SiC-graphite samples."

This study focuses on the effect of graphite nano-flakes addition on the microstructure, densification, and thermal characteristics of TiB2–25 vol% SiC composite. The samples were manufactured through spark plasma sintering process under the sintering conditions of 1800 °C/7 min/40 MPa. Scanning electron microscopy images demonstrated a homogenous dispersion of graphite flakes within the TiB2–SiC composite causing a betterment in the densification process. The thermal diffusivity of the specimens was gained via the laser flash technique. The addition of graphite nano-flakes as a dopant in TiB2–SiC did not change the thermal diffusivity. Consequently, the remarkable thermal conductivity of TiB2–SiC remained intact. It seems that the finer grains and more interfaces obstruct the heat flow in TiB2–SiC–graphite composites. Adding a small amount of graphite nano-flakes enhances the densification of the mentioned composite by preventing the",
