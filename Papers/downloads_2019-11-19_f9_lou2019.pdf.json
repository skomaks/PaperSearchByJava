The core issue of the growth of high-performance flexible sensors is controlling the attributes of material systems. For the purpose of realizing exotic functions, the use of efficient and extremely practical three-dimensional (3D) systems in device structures is termed as an attractive solution because complex 3D structures are capable of achieving customized behaviors with not only optical but also thermal, mechanical and electrical attributes, which extend their degrees of practicality beyond those that can be attained with conventional, planar material systems. In this review, we first discuss methodologies for the fabrication of 3D multilevel architectures and explain how these programmable\ntructurally engineered behaviors igh performance lexible sensors\nmaterials are capable of enhancing the performance of flexible sensors. Because the electrical, optical and mechanical properties of programmable materials are affected by their structure, shape and size, these factors are of crucial significance in the design and function of flexible sensors. Finally, we offer a discussion on not only recently developed structural materials and their potential applications in flexible sensors but also the key challenges and future directions of this field.\n© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Efforts to produce state-of-the-art flexble sensors that are sufficiently robust and durable to withstand echanical damage have resulted in reports of high-performance lectronic materials [1]. Nevertheless, the majority of commerial substances with reasonable electronic characteristics are prone o exhaustion, and show poor sustainability when subjected to arge deformations, making it quite difficult to directly integrate hem into the development of flexible and stretchable devices. hus, the key aims deal with establishing methodologies for conrolling the characteristics of material systems and the features f resulting developed devices, not just through chemistry and orphology but also through three-dimensional (3D) architecures. In addition, the growth of strategies to form 3D programmable tructures in advanced materials is gaining increasing attention ue to the capacity to create material systems that basically have ifferent characteristics and functions [8–13]. Some of these 3D rogrammable structures can display different physicochemical haracteristics much different from those of current materials. For xample, metamaterials, or cautiously structured materials, usually omprise sporadically arranged building blocks, which manifest haracteristics and functions differing from and surpassing those f their constituent materials instead of simply bringing them ogether [14]. A number of these types of 3D structure designs re derived from advanced assembly technologies (e.g. printing rocesses, folding processes, and lithography techniques.), in part wing to the different kinds of intricate structures that can be ttained by manipulating nanomaterials that have predefined paterns [15]. Recent research has establishded systematic rules for D printing techniques for the achievement of micro/nanoscale rchitectures. Lewis et al. demonstrated an omnidirectional printng method for the fabrication of patterned silver microelectrodes 16]. The patterned microelectrodes are capable of withstanding ecurring bending and stretching to large strains with little electrial characteristic degradation. In addition to 3D printing techniques escribed previously, ideas based on the principles of origami and irigami together with mechanical assembly have complementary otential to provide major benefits as they are compatible with ontemporary planar technologies and linked thin-film accumuation and processing methods [17,18]. Furthermore, lithography echniques make use of 3D structures developed through the use f light to offer considerable flexibility in geometric designs [15]. or this reason, these 3D structures are typically used as building locks to provide a new avenue for the creation of new structural nd functional materials.\n3D programmable structures in advanced materials typically isplay outstanding optical, thermal, electrical, and mechanical roperties, which suggest superior advantages in flexible sensor pplications (Fig. 1). Advancements in these applications depend n developments in materials and methods for fabricating 3D tructures. For instance, 3D programmable architecture mate-\nGroup.\nrials exhibit robust deformable systems benefiting from their disparate 3D or 2D features by means of printing, loading and lithography technologies, thereby providing a desirable means of integrating different kinds of ideal mechanical behaviors, including linear deformability (i.e., compressibility and stretchability), flexibility, twistability and bendability [20,21]. Therefore, in constructing flexible sensors, architectural design on the nano- and microscales stemming from the growth of nanotechnology can serve as a strategy for rendering rigid electronic materials capable of accommodating the macromechanical strain that prevails in intricate settings. Lightweight materials with high moduli can also be attained with cautiously designed 3D periodic units that contain elements accommodating mechanical deformation to realize flexible and stretchable sensors while maintaining their electronic behavior [2]. Furthermore, mimicking 3D structure-based mechanisms for fabricating flexible sensors with specific functionalities can enhance the fundamental efficiency of such devices and lead to new concepts for flexible sensor applications. In addition to the above applications, 3D programmable structures also have promise for use in different types of growing fields, e.g., energy storage [22,23], robotics [24], and catalysis [25]. Although several reviews have briefly discussed aspects of the use of 3D structures [26–28], until now, there have been no comprehensive reviews focusing on 3D programmable structure-based flexible sensors.\nThe current review sheds light on recent findings involving the use of 3D programmable structures in advanced functional materials for flexible sensors. The first section discusses various techniques (e.g., printing, folding, and lithography) for fabricating 3D micro/nanostructures. Subsequent sections summarize structurally engineered behaviors in properties of interest, including optical, electrical and mechanical properties, of flexible sensors, e.g., strain and pressure sensors, photodetectors biosensors, and gas sensors. The conclusion outlines some challenges and opportunities for the prospective investigation of advanced 3D programmable structures.\n1 oday\nD m\nP\nb s l m a t r f t e t a o r a t i [ e v V b a\nt t w a e s 3 o ( r a t s h\nt p h T p i f r w p t p c t d s c b t e i\n78 Z. Lou et al. / Nano T\nesign strategies for the assembly of 3D icro/nanostructures\nrinting processes\nPrinting, which is an effective and reproducible method, can e used to build 3D structures on various substrates with a tuned hape and size for various applications, especially the fabrication of arge-area flexible sensors [29]. 3D printing provides exceptional\nechanism flexibility, coupled with geometric controllability. In ddition, printing has the ability to attain extensively elevated hroughput using low raw material usage, allowing substantially educed costs [30]. Several printing technologies are used to manuacture flexible sensors, including gravure printing, screen printing, ransfer printing and inkjet printing [31]. The most extensively mployed method for 3D printing is dependent on externally conrolling the scanning deposition nozzles wherein 1-3D structures re developed in a layer-by-layer manner. Materials usually develped for particulate and/or polymeric species having the intended heological properties play the role of ‘inks’. According to the charcteristics of ink and the nature of the transport process, these echnologies can be further divided into two categories: liquid nk jet printing and micro-extraction printing of viscoelastic ink 32–34]. These versatile methods can facilitate the assembly of xtremely oriented and patterned micro/nanowire/fiber arrays on arious substrates with control over the layers, density and pitch. ery sophisticated 3D architecture materials can be easily achieved y means of 3D printing (Fig. 2) [35,36], with intricacy in the planar nd/or 3D spaces.\nTraditional, convenient methods have been developed through he use of various 3D printing techniques. Specific space archiectures with sporadic or aligned pores allow rapid ion transport, hich is beneficial for rapid charging/discharging; in addition, the ugmentation of substances by loading in the third dimension is xpected to immensely amplify their sensing capability. Recent tudies have established methods for the fabrication of complex D structures at a micro/nanoscale resolution in an extensive array f substances, including inks based on concentrated nanoparticles NPs) [37,38], polymers [39,40], colloids [41–43], and carbon mateials [44,45]. In addition, the primary regions of prevailing interest re in conductive inks due to their significance in major applicaions, from rigid to flexible and wearable sensors. The following ubsections shed light on some of the recent advancements that ave been made.\n1D nanowire assemblies by inkjet printing. Inkjet printing involves he use of nozzles via thermal or electrical mechanisms for the purose of delivering liquid drops to intended areas on a substrate and as been recently used for the assembly of nanowires/fibers [46,47]. he printability of inks is primarily determined by three important arameters of fluids, i.e., the surface tension, density, and viscosty. A suitable viscosity, density and surface tension are essential or producing droplets without clogging the nozzles. Coleman et al. eported the production of semitransparent silver nanowire arrays ith good optical conductivity ratios of ∼40 fabricated by inkjet rinting (Fig. 3a-d) [48]. In addition, it is quite convenient to conrol lateral characteristics, for instance, the length and width of rinted lines. Ag nanomaterials dispersed in isopropyl alcohol alone annot effectively be made into nanowires by inkjet printing; due o the low viscosity and the consequent development of satellite rops, the ink disperses during flight from the printing head to the ubstrate. However, an optimized suspension with a suitable visosity ( = 4.6 ± 0.3 mPa s) and surface tension ( = 28 mJ/m2) can e printed precisely on fixed areas to create high-aspect-ratio feaures with no satellite drops. In addition to this investigation, Lewis t al. incorporated changes into the ink composition through the ntroduction of stable, particle-free silver precursor inks (Fig. 3e)\n26 (2019) 176–198\n[16]. After this printing step, a gel-based 1D silver line (5 m wide) was printed on a silicon substrate (Fig. 3f). In this work, silver acetate was dispersed in ammonium hydroxide for the purpose of making an aqueous ink. The reactive silver ink could be directly printed on the substrate for the production of 1D-structures with high transparency and high electrical conductivity, thereby opening new avenues for the integration of printed sensors.\n2D/3D nanowire assembly inkjet printing. Microextrusion printing offers more opportunities for 3D structuring because of the extensive array of ink designs and feature sizes. A printing head robotically controls the extrusion of an ink onto a substrate, wherein a handling and dispensing system pneumatically or mechanically (using a piston or screw) controls the extrusion of a substance in fully-defined ambient environment. Wang et al. proposed a retrofitted inkjet printing process for the controlled mass production of high-quality microwire arrays (Fig. 4a) [49]. This technique uses a syringe as a printing head, coupled with two slits with contrasting forces, controlling the self-assembly of micro/nanowires. Through movement of the platform, the protruding microwire ends are primarily attached to a flexible substrate; subsequently, the rest of the length and direction is determined using a computer program to control movement on the x and y- axes. Zn2GeO4 microfibers can be 3D-printed in a direct manner on a flexible polyimide (PI) substrate for the formation of an aligned wire array. By changing the direction of the movement of the printing head on the x- and y- axes, convenient control over the formation of nanowires is possible (Fig. 4b-f). This technique is likely to be helpful in the development of more complex methods, capable of fabricating intricate computer circuits.\nFig. 4g–l presents information on the use of inorganic materials (ZnO (Fig. 4g, j) [50,53], In2O3 [54],) organic materials (polylactic acid, Fig. 4h,k) [51] and biomaterials (chitosan, Fig. 4i, l) [52] to print micro/nanofiber arrays. Each method can produce patterns with outstanding uniformity and without errant droplets, which confirms the exceptional dependability and efficacy of these methods. In addition, the micro/nanowires/fibers are unchanged after calcination to remove impurities, as presented by the optical micrographs and SEM images, respectively (Fig. 4g–l).\nMechanical printing has been used for the fabrication of 3D multinanowire structures. Printable graphene oxide (GO) gel inks have been printed to stack 3D structures at room temperature in a direct manner (Fig. 5a–c) [55]. Low concentrations of GO ink with cCa ≈ 15 × 10−3 m have been used as gel inks. The GO gel ink is loaded into a movable syringe, controlled by a programmable robot deposition arm and extruded through a nozzle to deposit 3D structures with good homogeneity and optimum elasticity (G′≈104 Pa). Recently, Zhu et al. reported an innovative, novel aqueous GO ink and demonstrated the fabrication of graphene aerogel microlattices printed using the developed ink (Fig. 5d) [56]. They additionally used the graphene-based composite aerogels to assemble a sandwiched supercapacitor. Through the logical design of the electrode structure, the 3D printed graphene structure shows the potential of high quality loading and structure customization to improve power density.\nFolding processes\nThe pervasive presence of effective and extremely functional 3D systems in biology indicates that the same types of architectural designs could be beneficial in flexible sensor applications by extending the degree of functionality beyond what can be attained using conventional, planar 2D platforms [12]. There are several examples of the worth of 3D structures in achieving unique characteristics using straightforward substances (Fig. 6) [19,20,57–59]. In addition, advancements in this area are usually constrained by the\nZ.

Folding gives rise to an extensive array of intricate orpho-functional structures naturally, such as with, proteins and ntestines, in addition to enabling the growth of structures, such as ith flowers, leaves and insect wings [63]. For intricate 3D strucures inspired by origami, folding has promise as a route for 2D to D alterations [64]. Starting with an individual sheet of paper or ven a linear string, intricate 3D objects that have unique mechancal characteristics can be developed via folding [65]. Thus, ideas erived from the ancient art of origami and from nature are appliable for the creation of a novel category of effective and extremely unctional 3D substances. This section focuses on the folding methds caused by internal stress, including the two most advanced ethods based on 4D printing, as well as micro and nano origami 34]. 4D printing follows traditional 3D printing with a shape-\norphing step and can be used to make more intricate shapes han those feasibly achieved by traditional 3D printing [66]. One xample of ceramic-based 4D printing is the use of elastomeric olydimethylsiloxane matrix nanocomposites in programmable rchitectures [67], wherein the hierarchical matrix exhibits emarkable properties of conventional ceramics, such as high theral stability, mechanical resistance to tribology and chemical esistance to oxidation and corrosion (Fig. 7a–f). Another impresive example is reversible shape changing structures that can be\n. Reproduced with permission [50]. Copyright 2014 Nature Publishing Group. (h–k) pyright 2016 IOP Publishing.

Various self-folding structures were printed via desolvation stimulated by bending deformation (Fig. 7e–g). When the bent structure is placed into solution with the appropriate solubility parameters, in addition to reduced crosslinking, this material can absorb solutions (such as acetone) and expand, forcing the bending structure to recover. Because PEGDA with lower crosslinking degree has reasonable swelling potential in acetone, acetone can cause swelling, and the swelling feedback is fast due to the same swelling parameters. The acetone molecules are expected to diffuse out of the structure, allowing the structure to bend once again (Fig. 7f) and reversing the shape change. Accordingly, 4D printing is a straightforward and economical means of creating active structures with great potential for applications with composite substances, such as soft robotics and endovascular stents.\nMicro/nanoscale origami. Folding deformation has the potential to serve as the underlying foundation for origami-inspired assembly at the micro/ nanoscale [70,71]. In the majority of published reports, rigid nanocomposite sheets can attain atypically elevated extension after fabrication by microscale kirigami patterning, which is the result of stress delocalization over a number of deformation points. Folding methodologies are capable of not only paving the road for the use of predictive deformation mechanics in such intricate substances as composites but also allowing the systematic engineering of elasticity. In conventional kirigami, a pattern of cuts is made in paper sheets, to attain the targeted topology upon folding. Recently, Zhu et al. developed a new approach for the shape morphing of 2D composite sheets, which was guided\nZ. Lou et al. / Nano Today 26 (2019) 176–198 181\nF ces.

The composite sheet nderwent laterally nonuniform shrinkage upon heating, changing he Gaussian cur-vature of the sheet and transforming the flat sheet nto a curved 3D structure. Other examples of folding-based prorammable structures make use of GO as nanoscale building blocks or the fabrication of all-graphene self-folding paper, wherein he self-folding material responds to light and exhibits swelling haracteristics (Fig. 8c) [69]. By means of the rational design of rogrammable architectures, integrated GO-PDA/rGO paper could chieve high mechanical strength and stability. The GO-PDA layer s capable of absorbing water from the atmosphere, which leads o swelling, while water is lost upon NIR/laser light irradiation, timulating shrinkage (Fig. 8d).\nithography-based 3D writing technologies\nLithography-based 3D writing technology is considered the ost widespread micro/nanoscale patterning methodology due to ts productivity and performance [75]. The term photolithography arries a literal translation of writing in stone with the use of light ased on the Greek origins of the term. Usually, the “stone” is a ilicon wafer layered with a light-sensitive polymer. The exposure f this polymer to light (or electrons/ions) modifies the solubility f the polymer in local areas of a given pattern; the mechanism is emonstrated in Fig. 9a [72]. Contrary to nozzle-based methodoloies, these approaches are effective applied using a thin array of ubstances while still offering outstandingly resolution and printng speeds.

They first prepared colloidal metallic VO2 nanocrystals (NCs), followed by patterning a nanostructured Si master as a structure template (size and shape) on the surface of polymer resist by nanoimprint lithography. Then, a thin layer of colloidal NCs is spin-coated on the topmost surface of the patterned substrate, and the polymer resist is then lift-off for the deposition of patterned VOx thin films. In addition, phase-changing VO2 nanostructures can be produced through the use of rapid thermal annealing. In the current work, nanopillars and nanowires with diameter of 300 nm and 100 nm were attained (Fig. 9c–d). Moreover, the pattern of the 3D structures was controlled by the light exposure patterns.\nYang et al. combined a centrifugation methodology with conventional photolithography for the fabrication of 1D arrays on the basis of GO nanosheets and SiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 9e) [74]. They first prepared gold electrodes, followed by patterning with the photoresist (AZ 5214) on a silicon oxide substrate via photolithography and lift-off. The bottom of the silicon oxide wafer was then functionalized with a thin layer of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), which has a positive charge, as well as a cysteamine composite, coupled with the gold facade (Fig. 9f). Subsequently, negatively charged GO-NPs were immobilized on the patterned photoresist substrate surface (electrostatic interactions) via centrifugation. A high density and uniform GO-SiO2 NP array was attained through the removal of the patterned photoresist with the use of acetone (Fig. 9g). This work provides a methodology for the fabrication of devices with wire array structures and the affordable production of related devices at an extensive scale via photolithography.\n182 Z.

Reproduced with permission\ndvantages of multilevel architecture materials for flexible ensors\nStructural design is a robust methodology for producing flexible ensors as it allows improvements in the stretchability of subtances ranging from soft to stiff [76]. With regard to the past wo decades, complex 3D structures with tunable optical, ther-\nal and electrical fields and highly unusual attributes have been eported; for instance, highly deformable properties, excellent ransport properties, high-aspect ratio features and high photoaborption have been demonstrated (Table 1).\nWith regard to optical properties, a logical design, coupled ith the self-assembly of photonic nanoarchitectures with fully efined structures and geometries, allows for the precise maniplation of light at the nanoscale, which has been a key emphasis f flexible photosensors in recent decades. Ma et. al. proposed a traightforward origami methodology for fabricating monocrysalline silicon-based focal plane arrays and compound eyes with emispherical structure (Fig. 10a–d) [19]. Using each polygon block s sensor pixel, silicon-based devices are fabricated into short icosaedral networks and artificial flexible plate networks, and further olded into concave or convex hemispheres (Fig. 10e-f). On the asis of the concave or convex hemisphere, camera system appliations have been illustrated, e.g., high-resolution hemispherical lectronic lenses that have a larger field of view, improved atypical maging, and enhanced performance compared with planar devices Fig. 10g–h).\ncal origami silicon-based electronic eye camera shows the laser point. Reproduced PVA nanocomposites with different kirigami patterns. (h) Stress–strain curves for opyright 2015 Nature Publishing Group.\nWith regard to mechanical attributes, kirigami designs allow sheets to reach a level of stretchability approximately 2 times greater in magnitude than that of pristine sheets (from 2% to 750%) [57]. As evident from Fig. 11, adding small cuts substantially alters the deformation behavior of a kirigami film, which results in reduced rigidness and greater elongation compared with a kirigami film that comprises only key cuts. Being specific, while hanging weights, a kirigami system comprising merely key cuts reveals nonsignificant strain ( ≈ 0%) until the force reaches 0.4 N. In contrast, a modified system with large and small incisions begins to extend under much lower force (0.1 N) and achieves more than 270% strain at 0.4 N. The smaller cuts also augment the eventual extensibility of films, as shown in Fig. 11b.\nWith regard to electrical characteristics, integration of the intended mechanical and electrical attributes at the fiber level is considered the most efficient but is still an uncommon strategy concerning flexible sensor applications. It is possible to fabricate stretchable conductive fibers by means of wrapping conductive substances (e.g., carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene) around elastic fibers (e.g., poly(styrene-block-butadiene-block-styrene) and polyurethane). Conductive substances have the potential to offer electrical conductivity, tensile strength, mechanical and thermal stability. For instance, aligned multiwall CNT sheets developed via chemical vapor deposition can be narrowly wound onto an elastic rubber fiber at a precisely designed helical angle, which results in a fiber that has a stretchability amounting to 100%, in addition to a maximum resistivity of 0.086 k cm−1 (Fig. 12) [92].\nZ.

Each sensing method is based n different materials and properties, which means that each ethod involves different mechanisms for responding to external\nechanical changes.

Properly arranged fiber arrays usually manifest improved output compared with nonwoven mats or isolated strands. Here, we discuss the fundamental physics involved as well as representative substances with regard to all cases, which are based on the 3D micro/nanostructures in advanced sensing materials.\nPressure sensors In particular, flexible pressure sensors have garnered wide appeal owing to their extensive applications in epidermal health examination or motion detection [97–99]. In recent years, researchers have paid extensive attention to the growth of both flexible and stretchable pressure sensors that have high sensitivity to medium pressure [100]. In addition, the sensing mechanisms of these pressure sensors include not only piezoresistive but also capacitance and piezoelectricity [101]. According to the structure\nZ.

(e) Schematic dia f) Fabrication process of biomolecular sensor based on graphene-coated nanopartic iosensors. Reproduced with permission [74]. Copyright 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag G\nf active substances and devices, all of these sensing processes have heir own attributes.\nWith the use of the basic piezoresistive effect and advanced anufacturing technologies, e.g., contact printing, micromachinng and direct writing, a flexible/stretchable pressure sensor can e constructed [102,103]. A contact printing method for the purose of assembling Ge/Si core/shell NW arrays on PI substrates as ctive matrix backplanes of flexible pressure sensor arrays (18 × 19 ixels) has been reported by Javey et al. (Fig. 13a-b) [102]. The interated sensor array can be effectively used as an e-skin to improve he spatial resolution to monitor the applied pressure distribution. ther researchers also demonstrated that such pressure sensor rrays have the potential to be used a printed CNT active matrix FT backplane for the purpose of plotting the applied pressure on an rea [104].

Furthermore, inkjet printing has been extensively used for manufacturing pressure sensors because of its affordability, variable digital printing patterns and low material consumption [106]. Whitesides et al. produced carbon-based piezoresistive mechanical sensors via inkjet printing on (3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10-heptafluorodecyl) trichlorosilane (C10 F)-modified paper. The compression resistance of the microelectromechanical system (MEMS) deflection sensor for the inkjet printing decreased throughout the upward deflection [107]. Liu et al. prepared a piezoresistive bending sensor by spraying Ag NWs and double-hydroxide-layered mixed inks on paper substrates with a low permeability threshold. A flexible human motion sensor with nontoxicity, robust bending stability, fast response and recovery times, good sensitivity and low cost was developed [108].\n186 Z.

Lee et al. proposed o use advanced 3D technology to manufacture biocompatible ireless pressure sensors and biodegradable intelligent polymer caffolds [112]. Then, the as-prepared wireless pressure sensor is ntegrated into the polymer scaffold to form an intelligent scafold platform, which has wireless pressure sensor and can monitor he blood pressure in real time. The unique design of smart stents ould minimize periodic medical examinations and control drug oses after stent implantation. Other programmable technologies, uch as direct writing, have also been used to fabricate higherformance capacitive pressure sensors. Hu et al. first described he process of writing directly on paper using silver NW ink hrough a programmable 2D platform (as shown in Fig. 13c–e) 109]. The thickness and electrical properties of the silver NWs irectly deposited before and after in situ sintering were studied sing different geometric shapes on the touch panel and compared ith detailed theoretical designs and the results of experimental nalyses. Direct writing technology has the advantages of allowing low cost and rapid sintering and producing one-time use devices hat are ultrathin, ultralight, and have large mechanical flexibility.\nOther sensors are based on piezoelectric sensing. The presnce of an electric dipole moment generates an electric charge in ome materials under mechanical force [113]. In recent years, HE rinting technology has been proposed to realize the controlled irect writing of snake-shaped micro/nanofibers with a large area nd high level of orientation by introducing the rope effect in the rinting process, which has shown a strong capability for the mulipurpose and rapid manufacturing of flexible/scalable electronic evices [46]. For example, Yin et al. introduced a new HE printng technology to fabricate snake-like/self-similar fiber structures rom piezoelectric polymer materials in a low-cost, large-scale and ligned manner (Fig. 13f) [110]. The superstretchable self-powered ensor adopts a s̈elf-similard̈esign and provides a unique s̈pring-onprings̈tructure to enhance the tensile properties, i.e., the prestress s greater than the initial stress on the serpentine nano/microfibers. he optimized device showed excellent performance, with a low etection limit of 0.2 mg as shown in Fig. 13g. The design, manfacture and application of HSS were also studied experimentally nd theoretically in this study. In summary, research shows that E printing technology can be used to construct a variety of senory components, with good mechanical properties at a large scale nd low cost, which have the potential for application in devices for uman gesture recognition, motion monitoring and other wearable lectronic products.\ntrain sensors A strain gauge or strain sensor is a sensor used to measure the eformation of an object [114]. Normally, strain gauges consist of atterned metal foils on flexible substrates, which can be easily ttached to objects to monitor their deformation. Strain sensors are eys to obtaining mechanical feedback from soft mechanical interaces in soft robots, rehabilitation monitoring, human-computer nteractions and medical treatments [115–117]. There are two main ypes of mechanical forces interacting with tensile strain sensors: n-plane and out-of-plane forces, which can detect the direct tenion and out-of-plane interaction of sensors, respectively [118]. ompared with 1D wire-shaped and 2D flat-film strain sensors, 3D tructural strain sensors based on new composite materials and EMS technology have better out-of-plane force sensing perforance. For instance, Baur et al. introduced a 3D ḧair-plugärtificial\nair sensor (AHS) with high sensitivity, which can be used to detect\now-speed airflow omnidirectionally [119]. The sensor is highly urable and can withstand angular deflection of more than 45 ngles in any direction without sustaining damage. Simple interation, durability, low power consumption (<10 W), small size\n26 (2019) 176–198\n(150–350 m), and ease of manufacture mark a new paradigm for the design and application of small-scale AHSs. Similarly, Liu et al. developed an AHC sensor inspired by biological hair cells [120]. The detection limit of the device under AC flow in water was less than 1 mm/s. However, the design of 3D stretchable strain sensors with optimized structures is very important for strain direction identification, high stretchability and improved sensitivity for out-of-plane force detection. Recently, Chen et al. reported a 3D architecture stretch strain sensor using 3D printing bonded out-of-plane capillary force-assisted self-pinning CNTs to monitor out-of-plane forces (Fig. 14a) [118]. The 3D stretchable strain sensor worked well under 120% tension strain applied to the sensing unit (Fig. 14b). It can also detect multiple strains and corresponding strain directions using a single sensor with good stability and repeatability (more than 10,000 strain cycles), which is essential for many applications. The mechanism behind this capability can be explained as destroying the symmetry of resistance networks via multiple out-of-plane loops.\nMoreover, 3D strain sensors with patterning and matrix shape modification have great advantages. They can absorb strain through micro and macro designs, thus minimizing the damage caused by strain. This is achieved by introducing spring-like deformation into the sensor coating via prestretching and a fractal base shape. Most strains can be used to unlock springs, and only a small strain far below the fracture strain limit of the coating is transferred to the conductive coating. Several research groups have focused on the application of macroscale or microscale technologies, such as kirigami, 3D printing, and etching, in this field [94,123,124]. Rossiter and his group studied a kirigami technique with a linear cutting mode and designed a stretchable piezoelectric strain sensor with unique 3D architectures, leading to high performance in large strain measurements [124]. Muth et al. developed a high elastic strain sensor based on carbon-based resistance ink [121]. The strain sensor was printed in a glove-shaped reservoir, producing a glove that could be worn on the user’s hand to monitor finger movements, shown in Fig. 14c–d. Recently, by means of selective activation, pressure is applied between the discharge table and the nozzle tip to break the oxide shell and merge the liquid core, thus forming a conductive path. The results showed that the process could be used to fabricate printed electronic devices with complex geometries. For instance, a coil pressure sensor and a snake-shaped strain sensor with good flexibility and stretchability have been developed (as shown in Fig. 14e). This technology provides a feasible method for manufacturing polymer tactile sensor based on liquid metal.\nThe bioinspired design of 3D structures is also an effective strategy for fabricating high-performance strain sensors [125]. In fact, in nature, animals and plants, such as spiders, which have unique 3D structures, have evolved flexible sensors to sense the mechanical signals caused by this deformation force [126]. In recent years, inspired by mammalian whiskers, Javey et al. developed 3D electronic whiskers based on the highly tunable composite films of CNTs and silver NPs using elastic fibers with high aspect ratios as templates [122]. The fabrication progress is shown in Fig. 14f. Because of the whisker structure, the sensitivity of the sensor is higher than most previously reported pressure sensors, and the pressure sensitivity is as high as ∼8%/Pa (Fig. 14g). More importantly, electronic whisker arrays with different structures have been designed and successfully applied to 2D and 3D wind field mapping. Other 3D biostructures can also be used in highperformance strain sensors [127]. A layered strain sensor based on ZnO particles has realized static pressure detection of 0.015 Pa and a strain gauge factor >104 by simulating the bristle characteristics. Such excellent performance further demonstrates the potential application of this sensor technology in the human-machine interface and wearable technology. Recently, electronic whisker has also been used to sense a wide variety of stimuli [128,129]. The\nZ.

Such arrays of adaptive electronic whiskers an translate proximity, temperature, material stiffness and friction nto accurate electrical signals. Furthermore, Takei et al. used the rintable nanocomposite inks to fabricate a fully printed multifuncional electronic whisker sensor with good sensing performance to train and temperature [129]. These two demonstrations exhibit eliable and low-cost methods to develop multifunctional sensors sing 3D programmable electronic whisker materials.\nibration sensors Vibration, a common mechanical movement, is ubiquitous in veryday life, ranging from the operation of household appliances o the bumping of car tires on gravel roads. In recent years, many exible vibration sensors have been fabricated on ultrathin subtrates using micro/nanostructures and piezoelectric materials to ense external vibration stimuli [130,131]. The unique 3D structure f the mammalian basement membrane allows for a high response o certain frequency ranges [134]. These new structural vibration ensors have bioinspired structures to achieve highly efficient and ensitive detection mechanisms. As an example, 3D printing techology has been used to achieve a completely new and feasible ay to reproduce the hearing system [132]. This so-called b̈ionic arïs the shape of a human ear printed with hydrogel seeds with iving cells; it looks and feels the same as a human ear (Fig. 15a) 132]. Instead of imitating the complex structure of the inner ear nd the precise transmission method of mechanoreceptors, the fullunctional bionic ear detects sound by receiving electromagnetic ignals from a coiled antenna (Fig. 15b).

(g) The R/Ro curves induced by gas flow for a representative whisker.\nand the auricular cartilage printed in vitro shows good structural integrity and shape retention around the coil.\nMoreover, complex 3D structures can utilize the advantages of viscoelasticity for the manufacture of highly scalable vibration sensors. Jeong et al. successfully demonstrated the direct printing of elastic conductors, which are embedded on the surface of the elastic substrates instead of printing on or inside, resulting in a highly sensitive vibration sensor [133]. The sensor can detect weak pulses and sound waves, and can be used as recorder, precision pulse detector and printing balance (Fig. 15c-e). Based on the viscoelastic properties of composite materials at high temperatures, a telescopic circuit covering the complex surfaces of 3D objects can be fabricated (Fig. 15f). Very recently, as a potential alternative power source for battery-powered electronic devices, vibration has also become an attractive target for energy collection [135]. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) with unique complex programmable structures could be innovative inventions for collecting environmental mechanical energy as a sustainable power source and activity vibration sensors [135,136]. In recent years, many studies have focused on the reasonably designed 3D structure of TENG that enables TENG to have superior performance in environmental vibration energy acquisition and sensing [137]. First, the new principle of obtaining vibrational energy through TENG based on a harmonic resonator was introduced by Wang et al. [138] In addition, TENG can also be used as a self-powered activity sensor to detect environmental vibrations, such as roadside vibrations triggered by normal human walking. When a person walks to the TENG on the floor naturally, the power output can be obtained successfully. When the maximum effective range is 5 m, the electric output amplitude is exponentially related to the distance between footprint and TENG. Some other 3D advanced materials used in TENG have also been investigated by several groups, which show\n190 Z.

Due to the nique wavy-structured design, the TENG device can be comfortbly attached to human skin to monitor the gentle movement f muscles, joints and even the laryngeal knot. And then similar orks have also been introduced by their group. They fabricated he slinky- and doodlebug-shaped TENGs with a short-circuit curent of 2 A and an open-circuit voltage of 20 V using the origami echnology by properly folding printer papers [141]. Moreover, he as-fabricated TENGs can obtain environmental mechanical nergy from various human movements and used as a self-powered echanical sensor. These results show that TENG is sensitive to nvironmental mechanical motions, making it suitable for a variety f energy collection or sensing environments.\nlexible optical sensors\nThe photosensitivity of electronic devices is the primary techology of automobile, biological health monitoring and remote ontrol systems [142–144].

Receiving inspiration from origami and biology, complex 3D structures are anticipated to become a path of 2D-3D conversion. However, current work has yet to achieve the essential mix of functional materials, mechanical design, system-level architecture and the integration capability of practical equipment with unique operating characteristics. This following section provides an introduction of the latest advancements in 3D programmable photosensing technologies.\nPatterning image sensor Image sensors are widely used in the national defense, industry, and digital camera fields, among others [148]. Flexible image sensor is an important functional unit of flexible optoelectronic systems. The existing rigid silicon-based image sensor is incompatible with flexible substrate and has low light absorption, which makes it impossible to realize the functions of flexible optoelectronic devices and systems. Fan et al. produced a concept verification image sensor consisting of 1024 photodiode pixels using 3D vertical MAPbI3 NWs [149]. A 10 × 10 flexible sensor array with Zn2SnO4 nanowire photodetectors modified by ZnO quantum dots as sensitive pixels was also studied by our group [150]. It can effectively detect the letters Ëänd F̈ünder ultraviolet irradiation.\nZ.

Patterning technology, including nkjet printing, spin-coating and photolithography, is a powerul and cost-effective technology for depositing high-precision, igh-resolution photodetectors [151]. It is not only of great sigificance for graphic applications but also has great potential for hotoelectronic direct printing. Kim et al. reported a simple high esolution spin-mode (SOP) process for silicon-based perovskite ulti-channel image sensor array. [152]. A high-performance, ltrathin (4 m) and deformable matrix with a multiplexed paterned perovskite photodiode array was also developed, as shown n Fig. 16a-b. These works provide important guidance for the atterning of perovskite films in multilayered, multiplexed phoodiode arrays. However, there are some improvement to be\nade before large-scale commercialized image sensor applicaions can be achieved, such as high dark current and low response peed.\nDue to the loss of CH3NH3X under environmental conditions, he device stability of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite-based hotodetectors is a major concern. In addition to organic-inorganic erovskite, inorganic semiconductors have excellent electronic and hotoelectric properties and excellent stability. Recently, our group abricated high-performance flexible photodetectors on printed ligned Zn2GeO4 microwire arrays using near-field direct printing 153]. The sensing performance could be adjusted by controlling he patterned microwires. More importantly, we have developed he most advanced image sensors and visual memory systems,\nhich stimulate the logical integration of image sensors and stor-\nge devices, thus using the same graphical technology in the bionic esign of human visual memory to realize the process of optical nformation perception and memory, as shown in Fig. 16c–d [54].\nrlag GmbH & Co.

Further improvement of spatial resolution can realize the simulation of capturing and storing high-resolution images in human visual memory. The structure and patterned design of device arrays provide a new way to integrate functional sensors and memory devices, which can be used to simulate human echo memory and tactile memory. Moreover, similar direct printing work on flexible photodetectors has also been reported by several groups [50].\n3D architectures photodetector Compared with 2D planar materials, optoelectronic materials deployed in complex 3D structures can provide a relatively high level of functionality. Among recently introduced methods, there is a scheme for the mechanical assembly of fine 3D mesoscopic structures guided by compressive buckling associated with a tensile elastomer matrix [62]. Some designs are reminiscent of those completed on the macroscale via origami/kirigami; these designs have specific shapes and sizes and can span several orders of magnitude in feature size, reach submicron levels in transverse features, and reach tens of nanometers in thickness [21]. Rogers et al. explored the application of 2D MoS2 nanomaterials in functional 3D systems, which were formed by geometric transformation under the guidance of compressive buckling [154]. The structures of the optical sensors with a 3D optical detection/imaging capability are illustrated with as an example. Structures with a 3D light detection/imaging capability were fabricated using a combination of single-layer MoS2 and graphene photosensitive elements; each layer, consisting of MoS2 and graphene, provides an extraordinary combination of optical, mechanical and electrical properties\n192 Z.

Fig. 17a presents a SEM image of he resulting 3D system. Three MoS2 photodetectors have been upported by the hemispherical structure supports on each arm. he entire array consists of 48 devices, all of which are interconected with a double-layered graphene trace network. The device lso shows a good response to visible light (532 nm). Fig. 17b hows the photo response of the device under different illuminaion intensities. This study may herald other opportunities to design nique system-level functions by deploying 2D materials in 3D esign. He et al. demonstrated a low cost and simple paper-based hotodetector array that uses printable zinc oxide NWs, carbon lectrodes and origami-based technology with excellent deformaility [155]. In this study, by combining paper printing, array design nd Miura origami, high deformation properties, including torsion up to 360 ◦), bending (±30 ◦) and tension (up to 1000% strain), an be obtained even when using intrinsically fragile inorganic lectronic/optical materials. This origami technology is not only imited to paper-based electronic products, but also can be used n other equipment with hard material characteristics so that they an be stretched or folded.

This flexible self-powered sensing system shows a large responsivity and an impressive detectivity which can operate under bending and functions at 360 Â◦ of illumination. Due to these unique features, the flexible 3D self-powered photodetectors can provide a new direction for the next generation of wearable electronics.\nThe 3D printing of electronic materials is a new method for manufacturing flexible optoelectronic devices [157]. Moreover, 3D printing can realize seamless and multi-functional integration of various devices on a single platform, improving the flexibility of the next generation wearable and 3D photoelectric equipment design and manufacture, and reducing the demand for traditional micromanufacturing. For example, McAlpine et al. designed a 3D printed polymeric photodetector with high sensing performance, as shown in Fig. 17e-f [157]. A semiconductor polymer ink was printed and optimized for the sensing materials of photodetectors. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) reached 25.3%, which was comparable to that of similar microfabricated products but was produced using only various customized 3D printing tools under environmental conditions (Fig. 17g).

Digital image senors provide exclusive imaging advantages in the hemispherical eometry, for instance, a broad field of view, coupled with low aberation, compared with their planar counterparts [134]. However, ransforming microscale semiconductor-based sensors that have igh spatial resolution into this format is quite challenging. Preiously, a method of fabricating hemispherical focal plane arrays sing semiconductor photodetectors was put forward for the purose of overcoming this challenge, and transfer printing technology as been applied to deform ultrathin semiconductor films on soft lastomer substrates (Fig. 18a-b) [158]. In addition, in this priary adaptation of the bending image sensor arrays, photodiodes, hich are based on silicon nanofilms, was combined with the use f deformable electrical microwires such that the pixels are not mpacted by the compression or stretching that occur while they end onto the hemisphere with the transfer of the whole array to\nsoft elastomer. Furthermore, a straightforward origami methodology for the abrication of monocrystalline silicon-based focal plane arrays and ompound eyes with hemispherical structures has been reported 19]. This silicon-based focal plane array houses over 250 photodeectors in a concentrated and compact array. A simple geometric esign that could be folded into a sphere was put to use as\npredesigned truncated network of decahedrons. Subsequently, he mesh was folded into a hemisphere that perfectly matches he corners of the pixels in the mesh. The results show that a icture captured by means of a spherical, faceted photodetector hat does not have a precise optical element. The further devel-\nit board.

Choi et al. developed a high-density, hemispherical curved image sensor array, which was designed using atomic-level thin MoS2/graphene heterostructures and strain-release devices [161]. This pioneering bio-inspiration method provides superior imaging capability with simple optical elements. More importantly, it can also achieve unique infrared imaging. Moreover, Jiang et al. described an artificial eye inspired by omental structure and superimposed compound eye [162]. Due to the 3D omnidirectionally aligned optical sensors, the image intensity have a great enhancement without consuming power. Fig. 18c–d shows that a stretchable photodiode and blocking diode array is connected to a snake-shaped interconnection printed on an elastic substrate and then transformed into a convex hemisphere with the use of a hydraulic actuator has also been reported [163]. In addition, the uniform pressure exerted by the hydraulic actuator forms an almost complete hemisphere comprising a number of photodetector pixels, similar to insect eyes. The convex microlens and the supporting column are positioned at the uppermost part of all the pixels, corresponding to a single ommatidium corneal lens and a crystal cone.\nFlexible biological sensor\nWith the potential application of wearable biosensors in personal health care and disease diagnosis, wearable biosensors have been widely used to detect various biological indicators, including protein, DNA, organic molecules, cells, and pH [10,164,165]. Flexible biosensors based on 3D structures can rapidly measure input signals with a linear dynamic sensing range and good limit of detection (LOD), along with other significant quantitative analytical performance characteristics. There are many methods for fabricating biosensors based on 3D structures, including the inkjet printing of liquid sensing elements, injection molding after soft lithography, and semiconductor lithography after coating [166–168]. The use of 3D printed biosensors in biosensing has the advantages of high-sensitivity detection, less quantitative analysis, complex batch production and the rapid fabrication of fine structures and\n194 Z.

Shah et al. emonstrated the use of a 3D printable graphene (3DG) composte, which consists of mostly graphene and a few polylactic acid opolymers and can be printed in 3D with liquid ink (Fig.19a) [169]. n a vitreous experiment with simple growth medium, without eurogenic stimulation, 3DG supported the adhesion, survival, proiferation and neurogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal tem cells (hMSCs) and significantly upregulated the expression of lial and neurogenic genes. These findings are consistent with the\nighly slender morphological structure of hMSCs, which is simi-\nar to those of axons and presynaptic terminals. In addition, 3D rinting technology can be directly used in the manufacturing of iosensors, especially microfluidic devices. A microfluidic device\nroduced with permission [169].

[170] The microfluidic device could be easily removed for reuse after exposure to flowing erythrocytes. Polyester membranes were used to detect biologically related adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules, and electrodes were used to simultaneously determine reduced oxygen concentrations. Wang and his group fabricated a flexible glove-based electrochemical biosensor by the programmable printed electrode system [171]. This programmable glove integrated real-time wireless data transmission device, sampling finger and biosensor detection finger which can address the challenges associated with chemical threat detection and reliable and rapid on-site screening. This study provides a new perspective for the next generation of flexible biosensors.\nBiologically stimulated reentrant structures have been proven to be an effective way to achieve high-performance flexible biosen-\nZ.

For example, the liquid surface was studied by 3D printing echnology based on two-photon polymerization [173]. The techology also has potential for applications in electronic devices, as sensors, microchemical/physical reactors, high-throughput iosensors and optical displays. Inspired by fish scale patterns nd kirigami art, these researchers also designed and manufacured fish-shaped, wearable biosensors (Fig. 19b) [172]. Paper as coated with conductive graphite paint on one side and then olded via kirigami to obtain stretchable paper substrates. This ighly stretched, fully inflated, disposable, wearable fish label nables sweat collection, diagnosis and motion monitoring. The uthors also noted that the paper sensor was tunable and that arious stretchable patterns with different elongation lengths can e obtained by adjusting the design. This fish-shaped sticker sucessfully combines the functions of health monitoring and body ecoration, and its appearance facilitates the acceptance of chilren and adolescents. Additionally, inspired by insect tentacles, hao and his group developed an antenna-like heterostructure onsisting of Prussian blue nanotube and TiO2 nanowire [174]. uch bioinspired structure has an effective 3D interface to sense ell activities and small molecules as biosensors. The as-fabricated iosensors show a great H2O2 sensing performance with a longerm biocatalytic activity, short response time, and broad detection ange due to the forming of biointerfaces. As a proof of bioinpired concept, McLamore et al. also fabricated a low cost and high fficiency biosensor based on 3D patterning of bionanocomposite etworks [175].

The above studies not only provide the methods for 3D inspired structure but also suggest the uniqueness of the programmable biomimic for biosensing.\nFlexible gas sensor\nWith the increasing severity of atmospheric issues, gas sensors capable of monitoring and controlling atmospheric contaminants have attracted the interest of many scholars across the globe [49,176–181]. Grain boundaries offer insistent inspiration, together with potential ways to design state-of-the-art gas sensing nanomaterials [49,176]. In addition, the bulk flaws existing in conjunction with polycrystalline substances have been revealed to produce a wealth of fresh electronic structures, coupled with the catalytic activity and mechanical characteristics involved in a number of applications. Direct writing technology is considered an effective methodology for the fabrication of grain boundary-based gas sensors with a 3D structure. Wang et al. recently performed a study addressing the impacts of bulk defects on polycrystalline-based, printable, flexible gas sensors (Fig. 20a) [49]. In addition, additive defects existing in similar devices are considered the primary parameters impacting not only the electronic but also the catalytic and mechanical characteristics of inorganic semiconductor materials (Fig. 20b). Therefore, it is possible to obtain ultrahigh chemical sensitivity to ammonia (598%, 100 ppm) using printed polycrystalline Zn2GeO4 wires (pZGO), which is among the greatest sensitivities attained by any kind of ammonia-based chemical sensor (Fig. 20c and d). Furthermore, the pZGO with GBs has an\n1 oday\no t p d 8 u o a\nt a a d u o r n p m s s e T i t ( e s o r m t [ u d o m e r\nC\no s h a a h b s a fl fl s t s i w t s 3 u a a\n96 Z. Lou et al. / Nano T\nutstanding mechanical robustness. After repeated folding (06̃0), he stability of its sensitivity was as high as 831% at RT (room temerature), and the pZGO with GBs device itself lasted for up to 60 ays. In the meantime, the initial sensitivity remained more than 8.6%. This advanced manufacturing technology, coupled with the nique device structure, opens up a new avenue for the application f polycrystalline substances in next-generation wearable devices nd other applications.\nNanoscale architectures in nature have exclusive functions, and heir exploration has resulted in substantial progress in different reas, including adhesion, wetting and optics. As established, the ntennae of insects are hypersensitive and respond ultra-rapid to ifferent types of mechanical and chemical signals, because their nique fibrous structure is linked to the mechanical/chemosensory rgans [183]. In this manner, Lee et al. proposed a highly sensitive, eadable and flexible hydrogen sensor based on H2 reactive Janus anofibers (H-NFs) stimulated by sensors, in which one side of the olymer nanofibers was coated with a layer of hydrogen sensing etal (Pd) (Fig. 20e) [182]. They made use of and reduced the key tructural attributes of the insect sensilla to obtain increased senitivity, coupled with the quick response time, originating from the xclusive characteristics of the dense array of biased nanofibers. he morphologically controllable H NF array had high sensitivty, showing a maximum sensitivity of ≈65%, and a quick response ime of 5.1 s in response to an existing amount of hydrogen gas Fig. 20f-g). In addition to the advantages of these outstanding proprties, the device also exhibits outstanding mechanical properties, imple chemical functionalization and reasonable in-situ tailoring f natural polysaccharide polymer chemical mixtures. Wang et al. eported a streamlined strategy for simulating the unique surface orphology of natural butterfly wings as multi-functional biomaerial templates, combining the functional properties of graphene 184]. Owing to the small detection constraint of 20 ppb and the ltrafast response time of 1 s, a proof-of-concept wristband embeded into the as-synthesized substance was applied for the purpose f monitoring diabetes-linked acetone fumes in real time. Furtherore, the humidity had a negligible impact on the acetone sensing fficiency, which is highly beneficial for the detection of acetone in espired breath.\nonclusions and perspectives\n3D programmable structures possess all the unique properties f nanomaterials, such as excellent mechanical properties, large urface area, high deformability, excellent transport properties, igh-aspect-ratio features, and photoabsorption. Highly ordered nd multilevel 3D structures make these materials more suitable s active materials for future flexible sensors. Recent advances ave established a series of technologies with astonishing capailities in the formation of 3D structures, in which key feature izes can be as small as tens of nanometers, and the thickness nd overall spatial range can reach centimeters or more. Various exible electronic devices, such as flexible mechanical sensors, exible optical sensors, flexible biological sensors, and flexible gas ensors, have been fabricated using such 3D programmable strucure materials. The high performance of these 3D programmable tructure materials proves their excellent potential for application n flexible sensors. The capability of fabricating various devices\nith identical performance on complex 3D structures provides he possibility of constructing high-performance devices with high ensitivity, high resolution and mechanical stability. Despite the D programmable structure has achieved great success in manfacturing and application, there are still some problems about dvanced materials to be studied in the future. 1) The functionlization and diversity of nanomaterials must be further broad\n26 (2019) 176–198\nto include the main functional materials integrated with flexible devices. These improvements will certainly provide new functions that ordinary 3D structures cannot provide. 2) The demand for application-related technologies can benefit from 3D geometry, or can be realized through 3D geometry, which will continue to be a powerful driving force for further research in this field. 3) Regardless of the rich patterns/nanostructures which obtained by simple methods, such as printing, folding and lithography, fabricating arbitrary patterns/nanostructure-based flexible sensors remains challenging because of the intrinsic limitations of the size and shape of patterns/structures. Therefore, researchers should combine simple methods to explore more innovative and complete structure. 4) It is very ideal to study the role of 3D programmable nanostructures in the practical application of flexible and wearable sensors and to identify areas for further improvement. With all the features reviewed and promising properties of advanced materials, we expect 3D programmable structures to exhibit new capabilities in applications related to flexible electronics.\nAcknowledgements\nZ.L. and L.L.W. contributed equally to this work.
