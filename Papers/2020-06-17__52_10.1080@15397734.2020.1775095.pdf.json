Introduction\nThe effect of small scale at micro/nanostructures is a controversial topic due to the lack of exact experimental results that predict the elastic behaviors of such structures. Several new continuum theories such as couple stress theories, strain gradient theory, nonlocal elasticity theory, modified nonlocal elasticity, and surface elasticity have been developed to study the elastic behaviors of micro/nanostructures. It is found that the equilibrium equations can be satisfied when the couple stress tensor is symmetric. Accordingly, Yang et al. and Lam et al. introduced the modified versions of couple stress and strain gradient theories, respectively (Thai et al. 2017). Also, it is notable that Alizada and Sofiyev (2011) presented a modified Young’s moduli for analyzing mechanical behaviors of nano-materials taking into account the scale effects and vacancies.\nMany researches have been carried out based on the modified couple stress theory (MCST) to consider elasticity behaviors of micro/nanostructures.

Communicated by Jie Yang Present address: China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC\nTsiatas (2009) presented a Kirchhoff plate model and analyzed cylindrical bending of microplates. Also, Yin et al. (2010) applied this model for investigation the free vibration of rectangular and circular microplates. In another work, using this model, free vibration of graphene sheets resting on a Pasternak foundation is studied by Akgoz and Civalek (2012). Ma, Gao, and Reddy (2011) generated a Mindlin plate model and studied different elastic mechanical behaviors of microplates. Karttunen, Reddy, and Romanoff (2017) used this model to present a new exact closedform solution for the axisymmetric bending of annular micro/nanoplates. The articles listed above are for homogeneous materials. There are fewer researches on the consideration of micro/nano shells based on the MCST. Hosseini-Hashemi, Sharifpour, and Ilkhani (2016) studied free vibration of micro/nano spherical shell using the first order plate theory. Farokhi and Ghayesh (2018) examined the nonlinear static and dynamic elastic behaviors of doubly curved shallow micro/ nano shells. Recently, researches focused on the mechanical behaviors of new generation of materials including functionally graded (FG) and porous materials.\nFG materials are made of two different phases often including ceramic and metal. Many works have been presented based on the MCST that describing mechanical behaviors of FG structures. Imperfections in structures of FG material are common because of mistakes in manufacturing process (Atmane, Tounsi, and Bernard 2017). Hence, existence of pores inside the material is inevitable. However, the shape and distribution type of pores depends on the constitutive components of FG material and manufacturing process (Barati, Shahverdi, and Zenkour 2017). Even and uneven porosity distributions are two well-known distribution types. In even case, the porosity distributes uniformly everywhere inside the material structures, while in the uneven case, the porosity exist more in the central zone of structures. The physical properties of porous FG material can be modeled by modified versions of power-law models, exponentiallaw models, etc. Some researchers in the world investigated the static and dynamic responses of porous FG micro/nanostructures using these kinds of material properties and based on the MCST. Shafiei and Kazemi (2017a, 2017b) considered linear and nonlinear buckling deformation of two-dimensional FG porous Euler–Bernoulli micro/nanobeams using generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) method. Shojaeefard et al. (2017) used GDQ method to analysis free vibration and thermal buckling of FG porous micro/nanoplates with circular geometry. Shafiei et al. (2017) analyzed mechanical vibration of the FG and porous Timoshenko micro/nanobeams. They applied even and uneven types of porosity along the two lateral dimensions of the beam. Kim, _Zur, and Reddy (2019) applied the classical and first-order shear deformation plate theories to obtain the bending, free vibration, and buckling response of FG porous micro/nanoplate. Also, it is notable that Wang and coauthors (Wang and Zu 2017a, 2017b; Wang 2017; Wang, Ye, and Zu 2019; Wang, Liu, and Zu 2019; Wang and Teng 2019; Wang, Wan, and Zu 2019) investigated the linear and nonlinear free vibration and forced vibration of shells made of composite, FG, porous, and FG porous materials by different methods. Gao and coauthors (Gao, Gao, Wu, et al. 2018; Gao, Gao, Chen, et al. 2018; Gao, Huang, et al. 2019; Gao, Li, and Yang 2019; Gao et al. 2020) studied vibration, buckling, and stability of beams, plates, and shells FG porous. They used numerical and analytical methods. Some of other researches done in this field have been introduced in the references (Gupta and Talha 2018; Karamanli and Aydogdu 2020; Shahgholian-Ghahfarokhi et al. 2020; Fattahi, Sahmani, and Ahmed 2019; Sahmani and Madyira 2019; Safarpour et al. 2019).\nAs it is concluded from review of the literature, no work has been carried out so far to consider bending and free vibration of FG porous micro/nanoshells based on the MCST. In this article, for the first time, static bending and free vibration of FG porous cylindrical shell are considered according to the three-dimensional elasticity and modified couple stress theories. It is important to note that a few researches have been carried out according to the three-dimensional elasticity for studying mechanical behaviors of FG micro/nanostructures (Salehipour, Nahvi, and Shahidi 2015a, 2015b, 2015c; Salehipour, Shahidi, and Nahvi 2015; Salehipour et al. 2017;\nSalehipour and Shahsavar 2018; Salehipour, Shahsavar, and Civalek 2019; Akhmedov and Sofiyev 2019). The equations of motion (equilibrium equations) and boundary conditions are derived using the Hamilton’s principle. A modified version of power law is employed to consider both FG and porosity distribution (even type) of physical properties. The cylindrical shell is considered simply supported at all boundary conditions. Different numerical methods can be used to solve the governing equations, see references (Wang, Liang, and Guo 2013; Wang 2014; Wang, Huang, and Li 2016; Wang and Zu 2017; Shu 2000). Based on the different numerical methods, many researches have been carried out to study bending, buckling, and free vibration of beams, plates, and shells. In this article, the GDQ technique is applied to numerically solve the three governing differential equations of micro/nano shells. By many numerical examples, the influence of gradient of FG material properties, porosity parameter, and length scale parameter on the static deformation and free vibration of cylindrical micro/nano shells are investigated.\n2. Modeling\n2.1. Modified couple stress theory\nThe MCST is constructed by this concept that the strain energy in micro/nanoscale continuum body depends on the curvature tensor in addition to the strain tensor as follows\nU ¼ 1 2 ð V ðr : eþm : vÞdV (1)\nwhere r and e are the Cauchy stress and Green strain tensors; m is the deviatoric part of couple stress tensor and v is the symmetric curvature tensor. They can be obtained by the following formulas\ne ¼ 1 2 r~u þ r~uð ÞT\n(2a)\nv ¼ 1 2 r~# þ r~# T\n(2b)\n~# ¼ 1 2 curlð~uÞð Þ (2c)\nr ¼ Ce (2d)\nm ¼ EðzÞ 1þ l 2v (2e)\nhere ~# and ~u are the rotation and displacement vectors. Also, l is the material length scale parameter, E(r) is elasticity modulus, C is the fourth order elasticity tensor, and is Poison ratio.\n2.2. Material properties\nConsidering a FG porous cylindrical shell is shown in Fig. 1. Ceramic and metal are two main components of FG material. The physical and mechanical properties of cylindrical shell are assumed that only change through the thickness. The variation of FG material properties is given by the well-known power law. Also, the porosity distribution along the thickness direction is defined as even type. According to the power law distribution of FG material properties and even type of porosity variation, the elasticity modulus EðrÞ and mass density qðrÞ of FG porous material are introduced as follows (Shafiei et al. 2017):\nEðrÞ ¼ ðEc EmÞ r Rh þ 1 2 p þ Em a2 ðEc þ EmÞ (3a)\nqðrÞ ¼ ðqc qmÞ r R h þ 1 2\np þ qm\na 2 ðqc þ qmÞ (3b)\nwhere\nEm ¼ 70Gpa,qm ¼ 2702kg=m3, ¼ 0:3 : metalcomponent Ec ¼ 380Gpa, qc ¼ 3800kg=m3, ¼ 0:3 : ceramiccomponent (4)\nIn the above modified power-law modeling of FG porous materials, a denotes porosity volume fraction.\n2.3. Extracting the governing elastic equations\nThe Hamilton’s principle is used to evaluate the equations of motion (equilibrium equations) and related boundary conditions as:\nðT 0 dðK þWext UÞdt ¼ 0 (5)\nwhere K and U stand for the kinematic and strain energies, andWext is the virtual work caused by the external forces and couples. For a micro/nano cylindrical shell, the kinematic energy is defined as\nK ¼ ðRþh=2\nR h=2\nðh0 0 ða 0 qðzÞ @ur @t 2 þ @uh @t 2 þ @uz @t 2 ! rdxdhdr (6)\nin which ur, uh, and uz denote the axial, circumferential and transverse displacements along the r, h, and z directions, respectively.\nIn the absence of external couples, the virtual work caused only by the external forces can be presented as\ndWext ¼ ð V frdur þ fhduh þ fzduzð ÞdV þ ð @V qrdur þ qhduh þ qzduzð ÞdA (7)\nFigure 1.

When x q m, n ¼ 0 problem is static deformation and displacement components are obtained as:\nUb Ud ¼ Kbb Kbd Kdb Kdd 1 Qb 0\n(32)\nAnd when Qb ¼ 0 the problem is free vibration and the natural frequency are extracted from the nontrivial solution as:\ndet Kbb Kbd\nKdb Kdd xqm, n 2 Mdd \" # ! ¼ 0 (33) 3. Numerical results\nAt first, we introduced the following normalized parameters:\nl ¼ l=h (34a) xqm, n ¼ xqm, na2 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi qm=Em p =h (34b)\nur r, h, zð Þ ¼ ur r, h, zð ÞEm= Q hð Þ (34c) By reviewing literatures, it can be found that no research has been done based on the modified\ncouple stress and three-dimensional elasticity theories for the free vibration and static deformation of cylindrical micro/nano shells. Hence, Table 1 gives a comparison results for the fundamental natural frequency of FG cylindrical macro shell based on the three dimensional elasticity. Good agreement between the present results and corresponding results given by Yas et al. (2013) and Yas, Sobhani Aragh, and Heshmati (2011) illustrates the validity of current solution. Table 2 and 3 list the first two natural frequencies and central deflection of FG porous cylindrical micro/\nnano shells with Rh0=a ¼ 1: The results are calculated for three values of material gradient index p¼ 0, 1, and 3, two values of porosity volume fraction a ¼ 0 and 0:1 (nonporous and porous), two values of length scale parameter l ¼ 0:0 and 0:5, two values of circumferential angle h0 ¼ p=12 and p=6, and two values of thickness to length ratio h=a ¼ 0:1 and 0:2: It can be seen that the natural frequencies are lower when the material is porous, while the central deflection is higher for porous one. The difference between the results (both natural frequency and deflection) of micro/nano shell with h0 ¼ p=12 and p=6 is more when the shell is thinner (h=a ¼ 0:1).\nA convergence study of natural frequency is reported in Fig. 2. The results are obtained for h=a ¼ 0:2, h0 ¼ p=6, and l ¼ 0:5: It can be seen that the result nearly converges for just 20 grid point that illustrates the rapid convergence rate of GDQ method. Also, the convergence rate decreases by increasing the material gradient index p. Illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 are the effects of\nlength scale parameter on the fundamental natural frequency of micro/nano shell with two circumferential angles h0 ¼ p=12 and p=6, respectively. The frequencies are computed for thickness to length ratios h=a ¼ 0:2, three material gradient indexes p ¼ 0, 1, and 3, and two porosity volume fractions a ¼ 0 and 0:1: It is clear that for both nonporous and porous material, the natural frequency enhances when the length scale parameter increases. One can observe that the effect of length scale parameter on the frequency is lower for homogeneous material (p ¼ 0). Furthermore, porosity volume fraction a has a reduction effect on the fundamental frequency. The reason is lower stiffness of porous material. A meticulous comparison between Figs. 3 and 4 reveals that for the higher values of length scale parameter, the difference between the frequencies of shells with h0 ¼ p=12andp=6 becomes more. Similarly, Figs. 5 and 6 plotted the central deflection urðR, h0=2, a=2Þ versus the length scale parameter. It is observed that increasing the length scale parameter decreases the deflection duo to the decrease of structural rigidity. Also, the existence of porosity volume fraction a increases the deflection of shell. It is seen that homogeneous structure (p ¼ 0) has a higher deflection rather than two other FG cases (p ¼ 1 and 3). Also, the effect of length scale parameter on the deflection is more for the homogeneous structure.\nFigure 3.

Fundamental frequency x11, 1 of a FG porous cylindrical micro/nano shell ðh0 ¼ p=6Þ versus the length scale parameter l, (a) a ¼ 0:0, (b) a ¼ 0:1:\n4. Conclusion\nFor the first time, three-dimensional elasticity beside the MCST employed to study the bending and free vibration of FG porous cylindrical micro/nano shells. All the available researches have been carried out based on the two-dimensional shell theories and the results of present threedimensional solution can be used to validate them. The governing equations were acquired from the Hamilton’s principle. Three equations of motion at each point of body and five boundary equations at each boundary are extracted. The numerical GDQ method was adopted to solve the extracted differential equations of FG porous cylindrical micro/nano shells. The effects of length scale parameter, material gradient index, porosity volume fraction, curvature of shell, and length to thickness ratio on the static deflection and natural frequencies of FG porous cylindrical micro/ nano shells were studied and discussed. It was concluded that porosity volume fraction has a reduction effect on the stiffness of structure, while existence of length scale parameter increases the stiffness of structure.\nFigure 5.

The well-known power law and even type function are respectively used to consider the variation of functionally graded material properties and porosity distribution. The governing equations are extracted using the Hamilton’s principle. The generalized differential quadrature method is applied to solve the governing equations of cylindrical micro/nano shells with simply supported boundary conditions. In the numerical result section, the influence of gradient of material properties, porosity volume fraction, and length scale parameter on the bending and free vibration of micro/nano shells are studied. The results of present article can be used as a benchmark for validating future mechanical studies of micro/nano shells. ARTICLE HISTORY Received 11 December 2019 Accepted 24 May 2020",
