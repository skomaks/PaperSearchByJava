Regardless of recent developments in various nucleotide-based therapeutics, the success of gene therapy in clinical steps is still limited due to less-efficient delivery mechanisms toward the targeted tissue or cells. In recent decades, nanotechnology has provided a remarkable breakthrough in developing safe and efficient gene carriers.\nGraphene and its derivatives, as sheet-like carbonic nanomaterials, have been progressively utilized in various biomedical fields. Currently, applications of graphene-based platforms extend to gene delivery as nano-carrier. Considering the unique structure and chemistry of graphitic nanoparticles, they provide high capacity for the loading of genes. To improve biocompatibility, biostability, cellular uptake and increase in gene loading capacity, the surfaces of graphene and its derivatives have been modified with various polymers or ligands. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the current status of graphene family nanoplatforms for gene delivery applications with a focus on the main graphene characteristics as gene nano-carriers. We further highlight the various types of modifications and functionalization of graphene, suitable for nucleotides loading and delivery. We finally address the future perspectives and challenging issues of graphene-based gene therapy for prospect clinical applications.\n© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\nContents\n1.

Introduction to gene therapy\nGene therapy, as a hot spot research, is a therapeutic approach that has attracted scientists and scientific communities for decades. This approach comprises the delivery of nucleotide-based therapeutic agents into the targeted cells to correct the genetic functions in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm [1]. Since the 1990s, the advent of gene therapy started a huge revolution in the history of biomedical sciences and was introduced as an effective strategy to fight genetic disorders. After three decades, today, CRISPR-based genome editing, as emerging concepts in gene therapy, remarkably increases promises of treatment of genetic-based diseases [2].\nRegardless of recent progress in understanding the molecular biology of genetically-based diseases and various developing nucleotide-based therapeutics, efficient delivery of the nucleic acids into the cells remains a major challenge, which has seriously limited gene therapy success, particularly in clinical trial steps. Therefore, the success of the gene therapy approach is mainly dependent on the development of a safe and efficient gene carrier [3].\nIn recent years, the emergence of nanomedicine and the application of nanotechnology in medicine, has greatly changed the face of gene therapy, where amalgamating the nanotechnology concepts and non-viral gene therapy approach has provided a breakthrough in biomedicine [4]. Nanotechnology provides an essential improvement in gene carrier design to have a desirable carrier, which could overcome both extra-cellular and intracellular obstacles. Despite decades of progress in nanoparticle design and synthesis, currently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved any nanoparticle-based formulation for gene therapy application [5]. Consequently, designing and developing optimum multifunctional nanoparticles still remains an opportunity for researchers.\nGrowing interest in graphene families, carbon-based nanoparticles, gave the possibility to apply this class of nanomaterials in medical applications, as has been discussed in several reviews [6e9]. In particular, graphene-based nanoplatforms attract tremendous attention in the delivery of various therapeutic agents such as drugs and genes [10e12], whereas these platforms have been suggested as an effective cargo delivery system for cancer therapy [13]. Looking at the trend of publications from 2004 to 2017, which have utilized graphene and its derivatives as gene delivery carrier confirms the success of graphene-based carrier in in-vitro and in-vivo gene therapy applications. However, a few literature reviews have specifically addressed different aspects and\nchallenges of graphene nanoplatforms for gene delivery purposes [14,15].\nIn this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the graphitic nanomaterials as gene delivery vehicles over the past seven years (Fig. 1). We briefly discuss the properties of graphene families’ nanoparticles as well as nano-carrier design criteria with a special focus on graphene modification approaches. We aimed to highlight biomaterial-based strategies in detail in order to design and modify the graphitic nano-carrier suitable for overcoming extra and intracellular barriers to have efficient gene delivery. In addition, more advanced multifunctionalized graphene nanoplatforms, which have attractedmuchmore attention in recent studies, are addressedmore specifically in dual delivery (e.g. gene and drug) applications.\n2. Graphene as a versatile nano-material\nIn October 2004, K. Novoselov and A. Geim shocked the physics world with their discovery of the youngest allotrope of graphite, graphene sheets [16]. Graphene, the basic structure of graphite, is a sheet of two dimensional (2D) single or few layers of sp2 ranged carbon atoms [10,17]. It is a fundamental constructive part for other graphite-based materials with various geometry [18] (Fig. 2). Graphitic-based nanostructures mainly include spherical structures (zero-D, e.g. fullerenes), rolled structures (2D, e.g. carbon nanotubes (CNTs)), or layered structures (3D, e.g. graphite) [4]. However, graphene and its derivatives usually address the sheetlike structure of carbon-based nanomaterials. The graphene sheets can be synthesized by either of two approaches: bottom-up or top-down methods. For example, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) serves as a bottomeup method and chemical exfoliation or the mechanical scotch tape method are categorized in the topdown methods [16,19].\nGraphene and its derivatives are interesting for scientists from disparate fields due to their remarkable physical and chemical properties, such as high young's modulus, great thermal and electrical conductivity, huge specific area and biocompatibility [8]. The application fields of graphene and its derivatives are ranging from electronic fields such as photoconductive materials [20], energy technology [21], optoelectronic devices [22], sensors [23] and composite materials [24] to biomedical applications, such as medical imaging/bio-sensing [8,25,26], tissue engineering [27], drug delivery [25,26], cancer therapy [27,28], antibacterial materials [17] and gene delivery [29].\nGraphitic materials differ in their structural features, such as number of layers, defect density, surface chemistry and layer size and composition. This interestingly resulted in a wide variety of tunable properties, which are considerable in biomedical applications.\nSince graphene arrival in 2004, many researches have been conducted on its structure and properties, but there was no discussion on the use of its medical applications until 2008, which is a starting point in graphitic material storming in the field of biomedicine. Nowadays, the range of biomedical applications of graphene and its derivatives is enormous, actually bigger than nonmedical applications [9]. However, for most bio-applications, the graphitic materials need to be functionalized with biocompatible modifiers (e.g. polymers) to improve specific properties or reduce toxicity. Among various biomedical applications of graphenic materials, more frequently reported ones, which have attracted ever-\nincreasing interest, are in the field of drug delivery [12], gene delivery [14], biosensing and bioimaging [30] as well as a more recent one, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine [7,31].\n2.1. Different types of graphene as nano-carriers\nGraphene family nanomaterials including graphene, graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), nano-graphene oxide (NGO), graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and graphene nanoribbon (GNR) have been widely used in biomedical applications. However, among the graphene derivatives, GO and rGO have been much more frequently utilized as nano-carriers for intracellular delivery of various cargoes, such as drugs and genes.\n2.1.1. Graphene Graphene is a two dimensional (2D) structure composed of mono or multi-layers of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms. Pristine graphene is extremely hydrophobic and exhibits poor dispersibility and stability in aqueous solutions because of the strong interactions among graphene sheets and the high tendency to aggregate. Biomolecules can be loaded onto the conjugated carbon network of graphene through p- p interaction [11]. Since it is quite hard to synthesize the single layer graphene without defects and also due to its poor stability in solutions, multi-layer graphene and GO are broadly used for biomedical purposes [10].\n2.1.2. Graphene oxide (GO) GO sheets, which are obtained by chemical oxidation of graphite under extremely oxidized conditions, are structurally different from the graphene, mainly in the richness of these oxygen containing groups in the GO sheets surface [11]. In fact, the ionization of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups and the electrostatic repulsion between them results in the formation of stable GO colloids in different polar solvents [32]. Awide variety of bio-functionalization of GO can be performed via chemical interaction between oxygen containing groups of GO and various biomolecules [11]. In addition, GO native functional groups might have undergone chemical reaction to form the other non-oxygenated functional groups (e.g. NH2).\n2.1.3. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) rGO is produced by treatment of GO under reducing conditions. Reduction of GO into rGO renovates its electrical conductivity,\ndeclines oxygen content and surface charge and enhances hydrophobicity [33]. In addition, the oxygen containing functional groups of GO are entirely or partially removed during the reduction process, which can introduce holes and defects in the rGO structure. The reduction process makes graphitic sheets less hydrophobic compared to the bare graphene and its basal plane reactivity is also lower than GO [10].\n2.1.4. Nano-graphene oxide (NGO) The term nano-GO is used for defining GO with a small lateral size, characteristically smaller than 100 nm and usually lower than 20 nm, whereas the size of regular GO in both dimensions is greater than 100 nm [34]. In fact, NGO resembles zero-dimensional (0D) material with a higher degree of oxygenation in contrast to conventional GO, which is 2D. Thus, NGO is considered as a decent candidate for biomedical applications due to the fact that its small size provides the ability to facilitate cell internalization and increase dispersion stability [33].\n2.1.5. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) GQDs are a type of quantum dots obtained by cutting 2D graphene sheets into 0D small dots, which are regularly shaped and their sizes are from several to 100 nm, and have the properties of both graphene and carbon dots (CDs) [34e36]. This conversion results in opening a band gap in GQDs due to quantum confinement and presents powerful photoluminescence, which does not exist in 2D graphene [37]. GQDs are structurally similar to GO and are composed of the main sp2 bonded carbon network, enriched with oxygen containing functional groups on the edges [11]. Due to their superior properties such as lower toxicity, better biocompatibility and higher resistance to photo-bleaching and blinking, GQDs are considered to be a promising replacement for semiconductor quantum dots, which are toxic [36,38,39].\n2.1.6. Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) GNRs are produced by cutting a 2D graphene sheet into a 1D narrow strip with a specific edge structure and width. Typically, the GNR width and aspect ratio are less than 10 nm and higher than 10, respectively; in fact, GNRs can be considered as unrolled CNTs [34,40]. Their band gaps are contingent upon their width and as a result, their properties can be changed from semi-metallic to semiconductive by decreasing the width [34]. rGO nanoribbons (rGONRs) exhibit higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity compared to rGO sheets [41].\n2.2. Therapeutic nucleotides delivered by graphitic materials\nGraphitic nano-carriers are able to deliver various types of therapeutic nucleotides in order to modulate the gene expression profile of cells. Two major manners exist through which the genetics of the targeted cells can be modulated. In the first method, DNA is delivered into the cells to provide a transcriptionally competent copy of a defective or missed gene and makes up for deficiency of a protein. While in the second approach, therapeutic nucleic acids consisting of Antisense Oligonucleotides (AONs), Small interfering RNA (siRNA), Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and MicroRNA (miRNA) are employed to inhibit or knockdown the expression of defective genes [42].\n2.2.1. Plasmid DNA (pDNA) Plasmids, known as double stranded DNA, are mostly annular and comprised of the transgene encoding for a particular protein. pDNA range in size from a few hundred to several thousand basepairs (bp). After internalizing into the cells and being uptaken by the nucleus, this genetic material commences, producing the\nencoded protein through transcription and translation processes using cellular machines. Besides the transgene, pDNA is composed of other modulatory elements including the promoter and enhancer sequences as well as splicing and polyadenylation sites which have a profound role in gene expression [43,44].\n2.2.2. Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) AONs, which contain 18-21 nucleotides, are delivered as singlestranded deoxyribonucleotides and must detect their complementary mRNA sequence, hybridize with the target mRNA and, as a result, induce gene knockdown [43]. Mechanisms through which AONs function are steric hindrance and target degradation. Steric hindrance, known as non-degradative pathway, influence the attachment of trans-splicing modulatory agents to pre-mRNA and thereby regulate splice models, while the target degradation mechanism can be achieved by the action of RNase H enzyme cleaving mRNA in the RNA-DNA hybrid [45,46].\n2.2.3. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or short interfering RNAs are double-stranded RNA molecules, composed of 20e25 bp in length, that interfere with the translation process through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway and degradation of complementary mRNA strands, and thus inhibit gene expression [47]. This function occurs through the gene-silencing mechanism, in which dicer protein chops siRNA into shorter segments among which there is a fragment with affinity for the RNA-induced Silencing Complex (RISC). After attaching to RISC, the passenger strand of siRNA is cleaved and the guide strand is directed to the corresponding mRNA leading to further degradation of the mRNA and gene silencing [1,48].\n2.2.4. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) shRNA is a RNA sequence which has gene silencing ability through the RNAi mechanism and comprises stems (25e29 bases) and a loop site (4e23 nucleotides). shRNAs are transformed into siRNAs by the dicer protein, which eliminates the loop part, and afterwards, siRNAs incorporate to RISC and cleave target mRNA [43,49].\n2.2.5. MicroRNA (miRNA) MicroRNA, a single-stranded RNA molecule with 20e24 nucleotides, is considered as a non-coding RNA, which regulates some cellular behaviors including differentiation, proliferation and survival. In fact, these functions are achieved by attaching to target mRNAs and then inhibiting the translational process or cleaving corresponding mRNAs [43,50].\n3. Nano-Carrier design criteria for efficient gene delivery\nFor efficient gene delivery, a carrier should be designed with regard to the cargo type as well as barriers, whereas the delivered cargo may be faced with in delivery routes. Firstly, the nano-carrier designed to deliver the genetic materials should be able to interact with nucleotides in order to efficiently load the cargoes. For successful transfection, nano-carriers should be able to protect the genetic materials during transport, overcome the extracellular and intracellular barriers and deliver the functional form of genetic materials into the target cells [51]. Several physiochemical parameters, such as surface charge, size, shape and surface chemistry are principal to be considered in order to design an effective nanocarrier system to that end. Bymanipulation of these factors, the fate of nano-carriers inside the body can be altered, and consequently the final success of gene therapy would be affected [52]. Herein, the main characteristics, which are needed to be considered in designing the graphitic nano-carriers, are briefly summarized.\n3.1. Surface charge\nSurface charge plays a prominent role in the gene/carrier complex formation, cellular uptake mechanism, cytotoxicity and stability of nano-carriers [53]. Genetic materials, such as DNA and RNA have negative charge due to the presence of phosphate groups in their backbone. Consequently, they cannot cross cellular membranes by themselves and need carrier systems, which can form complexes with them, compromise the electrostatic repulsion between them and the negatively charged cell membrane and facilitate their internalization into the cells [51]. One of the simple approaches to bind the genetic materials to carriers is based on electrostatic interactions between positively charged nano-carriers and nucleotides [54]. Both charge polarity and charge density have a crucial influence on the cellular uptake of nanoparticles as well as their cytotoxicity. Generally, positive surface charges juxtaposed with neutral or negative charges have been demonstrated to enhance the cellular uptake of nanoparticles due to electrostatic attraction with the cell membrane that is favorable for adhesion to the cell surface in both phagocytes and non-phagocytic cell lines [55,56]. Also, carriers with a higher positive charge density have been shown to be up taken at a higher level and in the most fastest rate [53,55]. Additionally, the surface charge of nano-carriers is able to determine the mechanism of cellular endocytosis. Positively charged carriers use the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway in order to internalize into the cells, while carriers with negative surface charge could be taken up through other pathways, such as the caveolae-mediated pathway [57,58]. However, nanoparticles with positive charge have shown more cytotoxic effects compared to negatively or neutral charged nanoparticles [55]. In fact, positive charge of the nanoparticle can increase Ca2þ influx into cells and thereby inhibit their proliferation, induce reconstruction of lipid bilayers and fluidity [59]. Furthermore, the stability of nano-carrier systems significantly relies on their surface charge, such that nanoparticles with a higher surface charge can exhibit more resistance to form aggregations mostly due to their strong selfrepulsive effect [52].\nIt is noteworthy that the surface charge of the carriers would be affected by gene loading. Due to amine (N)/phosphate (P) electrostatic interaction between the carrier and nucleotides, the surface charge of the complex would be partially neutralized [60]. The carrier/DNA ratio (known as N:P ratio) usually dictates the formed complex charge, while it raises to more positive values by adding N:P ratio. In a lower N:P ratio, the formed complex may be unable to effectively interact with the cell membrane [61]. Therefore, to evaluate the charge effect on gene transfection, the net charge of carrier/gene complexes should be considered.\nGO sheets contain epoxide (eOe) and hydroxyl (eOH) groups on their basal planes, whereas hydroxyl and carboxyl (eCOOH) groups exist at their edges [62]. Therefore, GO with hydrophilic terminates and more hydrophobic basal planes can be considered as an amphiphilic sheet [63]. The presence of terminal carboxyl groups can afford stability in colloidal dispersions and negative charge on the surface, such that the pH has an influential impact on this surface charge. For instance, high pH can upgrade the deprotonation of the carboxyl groups and therefore GO would become more charged [63]. Also, the uncharged groups existing in the basal plane, due to their polarity, provide surface reactions, such as weak interactions and hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, hydrophobic and free surface p electrons exist on the basal planes, which are able to form p- p interactions for non-covalent interactions. By reducing GO into rGO, it becomes a less hydrophilic molecule with a lower oxygen content and surface charge [10].\n3.2. Size\nThe size of nano-carriers is a crucial factor, which can considerably influence colloidal stability, cellular uptake, transfection efficiency and residence in circulation and clearance [52,53]. It has been observed that nanoparticles are taken up more efficiently as their size is declined in in-vitro [57]. Nanoparticles with a size around 20 nm are able to diffuse into the cells in an endocytosis pathway-independent manner. On the other hand, Rejman et al. demonstrated that particles smaller than 200 nm in diameter were internalized through the clathrin-mediated pathway, whereas, particles with a diameter larger that 200 nm but less than 1 mm entered into the cells mostly via the caveole-mediated pathway [64]. In addition, a longer circulation time can be provided by administration of nanoparticles with a size smaller than 200 nm in in-vivo. In fact, such nanoparticles revealed a lower clearance and a better delivery to target tissues instead of others, such as lungs, liver and the spleen. However, particles larger than 200 nm were removed expeditiously via liver, spleen and the lungs [57]. In the case of GO, size also has a critical impact on its amphiphilicity, so that smaller sheets are more hydrophilic due to having a higher edge-to-area ratio. In addition, a more colloidal stability can be made by smaller GO sheets as a result of a higher charge density [65]. In addition to size, the layer number is another prominent parameter that should be considered in the design of graphene family nano-carriers, since the specific surface area and bending stiffness are determined based on it [66]. By decreasing the number of layers to one or more, the loading capacity of the cargo would be effectively increased.\nSimilar to the charge, the size of the carrier can be strongly affected by gene loading. The effective electrostatic interaction of the carrier and nucleotides will result in gene condensation/ compaction. After gene loading, the size of the formed carrier/gene complexes usually shows an increase [67]. The degree of condensation remarkably affects the amount of size variation. However, the type and modification of the cationic carrier, the N:P ratio and also the protocol of complex formation can influence the complex size. For instance, by increasing N:P ratio during complexation, the complex size enlargement shows a decreasing trend, which is originated from more condensation of the loaded nucleotides [68]. Considering the importance of carrier size and charge in gene transfection efficacy, as discussed, N:P ratio during complexation should be accurately adjusted before transfection, so that the resultant complex charge/size still remains in a proper range and does not disturb gene transfection [69].\n3.3. Shape\nThe shape of nano-carriers, particularly in their transportation across biological barriers and also inside the cells, is of great importance [57]. Nanoparticles with various shapes, such as spheres, rods, discs, tubes and cubes reveal different uptake behavior, so that for nanoparticles with a diameter larger than 100 nm, rods, spheres, cylinders and cubes have higher uptake, respectively. Spherical-shaped nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm are taken up more efficiently in contrast to rod-shaped ones, whereas a lower cell uptake occurring as the aspect ratio of nanorods becomes larger. Despite the few studies conducted on non-spherical nano-carriers, some researches have demonstrated that the interaction of such nano-carriers with cells can be more complicated [59]. In addition, the shape of nanoparticles governs the efficiency of gene transfection. In the case of polycation modified silica nanoparticles, chiral nanorods with a length of 300 nm\nwere ascertained as the most efficient carrier in comparison to nanoparticles, whose shapes were different, including nanospheres with a diameter of 100 nm, hollow nanospheres with a diameter of 100 nm, chiral nanorods with a length of 200 nm and ordinary nanorods with a length of 300 nm. This is while hollow nanospheres juxtaposed with solid nanoparticles reveal better gene transfection [70]. The graphitic materials resemble a sheet-like structure with various thicknesses almost near a few nanometers, and lateral size around several nanometers to a few micrometers. This sheet-like geometry could provide a sharp edge to cross the cell membrane [71].\n3.4. Surface chemistry\nIt is well established that the surface chemistry of nano-carriers can effectively modulate their biocompatibility, circulation in the body, and particularly their interaction with the cells. It has been shown that the blood half-life of nano-carriers is contingent upon their surface hydrophobicity, so the more hydrophobic the surface, the more opsonin proteins absorbed on the surface and the shorter the circulation time [55]. Furthermore, nano-carriers with different types of surface chemistry can be internalized by the cells through various mechanisms. Nanoparticles with a hydrophobic surface internalize more expeditiously than those with a hydrophilic surface due to the hydrophobic nature of the cell membrane [57]. A wide variety of surface modification has been used in order to improve biocompatibility, circulation time, cellular uptake and thereby transfection efficiency of nano-carriers [52,59]. Surface chemistry is variable for each member of the graphene family. As aforementioned, GO has amphiphilic properties with a water contact angle of 40e45 ; whereas graphene is hydrophobic with a water contact angle of about 90 [66]. The surface chemical modification of the graphitic materials is a pre-requisite for their application as gene nano-carrier. In what follows, various kinds of methods used for modification of graphene-based materials are presented.\n4. Graphene modifications as gene delivery vehicle\nGraphene has poor dispersion and stability in aqueous solutions due to its high hydrophobicity and is bereft of oxygen containing hydrophilic groups, which are crucial for water dispersion. Therefore, GO has been easily produced through derivatization of graphene, a covalent functionalization method, in which oxygenated groups, such as carboxyl, epoxy and hydroxyl are generated on the graphene, in order to increase its water solubility [72]. However, GO has the tendency to aggregate in physiological solutions in the presence of salts and proteins as a result of the shielding of electrostatic charges, and also the formation of non-specific interactions with proteins [18]. To enhance physiological stability, cellular uptake and transfection efficiency, two main methods, including covalent and non-covalent modifications by different modifiers have been employed [73]. Non-covalent functionalization is preferred when the electrical conductivity and large surface area of graphene is required, while covalent modification methods are applied when the modified graphene is needed to have stability and strong mechanical properties. Studies have shown that DNA/ RNA condensation can be provided with both modification methods, whichmakes them suitable for intracellular gene delivery applications [74]. This leads to a series of studies by various research groups for the exploration of graphene-based materials in gene delivery as summarized in Table 1.\n4.1. Graphene modifiers\nSince the packing of genetic materials into carriers is performed through electrostatic interaction among negatively charged genes and positively charged carriers and the graphene family materials are intrinsically non-cationic, modification of graphene derivatives by various modifiers is required for providing a cationic surface having a better interaction with anionic genes. So far, several modifiers, most of which are listed below, have been utilized to that end:\n4.1.1. Polyethylenimine (PEI) PEI, a synthetic cationic polymer, has beenwell-known as one of the most effective materials for gene delivery vehicles. Suitable features of PEI, such as its capability to strongly bind to negatively charged nucleic acids through electrostatic interactions and condensation of the genes onto the surface of the vehicle, which are provided by its high nitrogen atom concentration, could enhance cellular uptake. It also shows the “proton sponge” effect, which can lead to escaping from endosomal/lysosomal pathways after internalization [61,76]. However, high molecular weight branched PEI (HMW bPEI) exhibited high levels of cytotoxicity and transfection efficiency juxtaposed with low molecular weight ones (LMW bPEI) [77].\nChen and coworkers synthesized PEI-GO conjugates by chemical grafting of PEI 25 kDa to carboxylated GO (GO-COOH) [78]. They observed that GO and GO-COOH expeditiously formed aggregation in the simulated physiological solution (PBS), while PEI-grafted GO was hydrolytically stable due to the enhanced solubility and stability provided with PEI conjugation. Moreover, PEI-GO revealed a high buffering capacity, which facilitated the endosomal escape of pDNAs and also provided a comparably higher luciferase expression in HeLa cells compared to PEI 25 kDa. In addition, the grafted PEI to GO showed a significantly lower (about 50%) cytotoxic effect, as carrier compared to the naked PEI.\nFeng et al. investigated the effect of PEI molecular weight on gene transfection ability as well as cytotoxicity of PEIfunctionalized GO nano-carriers. Two different molecular weights of PEI (1.2 and 10 kDa) were introduced to GO through electrostatic (non-covalent) interactions [76]. Based on the AFM analysis, a significant increase in the average thickness of GO nanosheets after incubation with PEI (from 1 nm to 3e4 nm) indicated that the electrostatic interactions provided a successful immobilization. GO-PEI-10k showed significantly decreased cytotoxicity in HeLa cells compared to bare PEI-10k, which was relatively toxic to the cells. Not only did the complexation of GO with both PEI-1.2k and PEI-10k reveal no increase in the cytotoxicity of GO, but it also showed rather higher cell viability at the higher concentrations of GO, presumably because of the enhanced stability of GO in physiological solutions (Fig. 3). Enhancing zeta potential to positive values (þ30e50 mv) via PEI immobilization promoted the loading of EGFP plasmid via the layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly mechanism. GO-PEI-1.2k showed a higher EGFP expression compared to PEI1.2k with ineffective transfection, whereas EGFP expression observed in GO-PEI-10k was tantamount to bare PEI-10k (Fig. 3, dg).\nIn another study, branched PEI (bPEI) was suggested to functionalize GO as gene delivery carrier [77]. Twomolecular weights of bPEI (1.8 and 25 kDa) were chemically conjugated to GO with three various ratios of bPEI to GO (22, 8 and 5). The formulation prepared by a simple mixture of bPEI and GO (physical immobilization) showed considerable aggregation, while the chemically conjugated pPEI revealed no aggregation in water, PBS, and 10% serumcontaining media. Conjugation of GO with bPEI under sonication reduced the size of GO from 500-600 nm to 100e200 nm and\nTable 1 (continued )\nType of Graphene Derivative\nModifier(s) Bonding/ modification mode Nucleotide- based cargo Study model Cell line/anima model Co-loaded drug Ref\nGO PEI (25 kDa) Gold nanoparticle\ncovalent pDNA In vitro HeLa e [91]\ncGO e e FAM oligonucleotide dT30 (FAM-dT30) In vitro Raw 264.7 cells e [110] cGO PAMAM-dendrimer and\ngadolinium (Gd) Covalent miRNA (Let-7g) In vitro In vivo human glioblastoma (U87) cells EPI [111]\nGO PLL Covalent Unmethylated cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide motifs\nIn vitro murine Raw264.7 macrophages\ne [112]\ncGO- R8 peptide Covalent e In vitro L929 fibroblast e [29] rGO PL-PEG/R8 peptide Non covalent Cell death siRNA (cd-siRNA) In vitro MCF-7 e [113] GO CS Non-covalent CpG ODNs In vitro RAW264.7 cells e [114] GO PAMAM Covalent MMP-9 shRNA plasmid In vitro MCF-7 cells DOX [115] rGO Neurotensin peptide\nconjugated-PEI PEI (noncovalent) Peptide (covalent)\npDNA In vitro In vivo PC12 cells C57BL/6 mice\ne [116]\nGO PLL SDGR peptide\nPLL (covalent) Peptide (covalent) VEGF-siRNA In vitro In vivo HeLa HUVEC ICR mice\n- [117]\nGO PEG/FA PEG (covalent) FA (Covalent) HDAC1 K-Ras siRNAs\nIn vitro In vivo MIA PaCa-2 Athymic nude mice\ne [118]\noxidized GNR e e a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) In vitro HEK 293T e [119] GO Four different CPPs Non-covalent pGL3\nsplice correction oligonucleotides (SCO) siRNA\nIn vitro e [120]\nrGO PEI PEG\nPEI (noncovalent) PEG (covalent) pGFP In vitro 11 different cell lines [121]\nAbbreviations: G: graphene, GO: graphene oxide, rGO, reduced graphene oxide, GNR: graphene nanoribbon, cGO: carboxylated graphene oxide, GCN: graphene and carbon nanotube nanocomposite, PEG: polyethylene glycol, mPEG:methylated PEG, SCM-PEG: succinimidyl carboxymethyl PEG, PL- PEG: phospholipid-PEG, PEI: polyethylene imine, LPEI: low molecular weight PEI, bPEI: branched PEI, CS: chitosan, PSS: poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonates), PAMAM: Oleic acid polyamidoamine, PDMAEMA: poly(2-dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate), PPI: polypropylenimine, PLL: poly-L-lysine, NLS: nuclear localization signal, FA: folic acid, R8: octaarginine, Py:1-pyrenemethylamine hydrochloride, FAM: fluorescent activated molecule, CPT: 10-hydroxycamptothecin, DOX: doxorubicin, EPI: Epirubicin, MB: Molecular beacon, siRNA: small interference RNA, pDNA: plasmid DNA, ODNs: oligodeoxynucleotides, shRNA: short hairpin RNA, miRNA: microRNA, LNA-m-MB: locked nucleic acid modified molecular beacon.\nincreased the thickness of GO from 0.6-1.3 nm to 6e8 nm. The impact of increasing the conjugation degree on the size and thickness was not considerable. Gene transfection ability of HeLa and PC-3 cells was increased with increasing conjugation ratios of bPEI to GO, where bPEI-GO with a higher conjugation ratio showed remarkable transfection even at lower N:P ratio, which was comparable to bare bPEI 25 KDa.\nGNR grafted by PEI (PEI-g-GNR) through electrostatic assembly was studied by Dong and coworkers as a nano-carrier of locked nucleic acid modified molecular bacon (LNA-m-MB) probes for the detection of miRNA [81]. PEI-g-GNR provided good protection of the LNA-m-MB probes against single-stranded DNA binding protein interaction or enzymatic degradation. It was also more efficient in the transfection of HeLa cells juxtaposed with PEI (25 kDa) and PEIgrafted multi wall carbon nanotubes (PEI-g-MWCNTs) due to the larger surface area of GNR for conjugation of PEI, and subsequently a stronger possible proton sponge effect.\nIn another study, the effect of GO nanosheet size on PEI conjugation and consequent DNA loading was studied. Chemically grafted PEI to NGO with a size of 10e20 nm was assessed in order to obtain higher capacity for PEI loading [86]. The PEI-g-NGO revealed three times higher enhanced green fluorescent protein plasmid (pEGFP) condensation capacity than PEI-g-GO. Transfection with PEI-g-NGOwas found to bemore effective compared to PEI-g-GO in both H293T and U2Os cell lines with similar cytotoxicity (about 90% viabilities). In addition, the pEGFP transfection study of zebrafish embryos showed efficacy of 90% and 80% for PEI-g-NGO and PEI-gGO, respectively, which were much higher than naked DNA injection (~30%), as an established transfection technique.\nChoi et al. utilized PEI- functionalized GO via electrostatic interaction for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) production through mRNA delivery to adipose derived fibroblasts [99]. PEI\nphysical immobilization changed the surface charge of nanocarriers from 34.66 mV to þ26.68 mV, suitable to binding of negatively charged mRNA. Treatment of human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) with GO-PEI-mRNA did not show significant cytotoxicity or expression of innate immune response genes, while those with GO, PEI, GO-mRNA or PEI-mRNA significantly dwindled cell viability and increased innate immune response gene expression. hDFs treated by GO-PEI-mRNA also showed very efficient transfection and subsequent reprogramming (around 50%), where the derived iPSC expressed pluripotency genes.\nAnother platform, based on the graphene/hydrogel nanocomposite, has been tested by Paul et al. for in-situ delivery of the angiogenic gene for myocardial therapy [61]. The nanocomposite was formulated by incorporating the DNAVEGF - loaded GO, which was synthesized through chemical binding of PEI (1.8 kDa) to carboxylated GO into methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) hydrogel, followed by photocrosslinking under UV exposure (Fig. 4, a). GO had a negative charge ( 37 mV), while PEI-functionalized GO was positively charged (þ43mV), whichwas reduced after bindingwith the negatively charged plasmid DNA depending on N/P ratios. In vitro studies showed that PEI-functionalized GO, gradually released from GelMA hydrogel, did not significantly induce cytotoxic effects on H9c2 cell lines and revealed a rapid overexpression of VEGF in the initial 4 days. In addition, in-vivo studies, which were performed by intramyocardial injection of nanocomposite hydrogels in the peri-infarct areas of a rat model, showed enhancement in myocardial capillary density, a decrease in the scar area of infarcted hearts after treatment with nanocomposite hydrogels compared to untreated groups (Fig. 4, b-d).\nCovalently grafted PEI (25 KDa) onto GO nanosheets was utilized to encapsulate Au nanoparticles (GO-AuNPs) or Au nanorods (GOAuNRs) through electrostatic self-assembly in order to improve\nbiocompatibility and gene transfection ability of Au-based nanocarriers [67] (Fig. 5). The size and surface charge of AuNPs respectively increased from 62.5 nm to 113.8 and from 6.6mV to 36.9mV after encapsulation with GO-PEI nanosheets, which were ascribed to proper self-assembly of GO and PEI on the Au surface. Although, the GO-PEI sheets formed aggregates with an average size of\n500e600 nm via electrostatic interactions between pGFP and GOPEI, which made the cellular internalization difficult and decreased the transfection efficiency, GO-PEI-AuNPs/pDNA created no obvious aggregates conceivably due to the smaller contact area between GO-PEI-AuNPs spheres compared to GO-PEI sheets. Encapsulation by GO significantly declined the rather cytotoxic\neffects of AuNPs and AuNRs to HeLa cells and enhanced their transfection ability.\n4.1.2. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) PEG is a biocompatible amphiphilic polymer, which could improve aqueous solubility and stability in physiological solutions, reduce toxicity, prolong nanomaterials’ blood circulation time through hindering protein adsorption and decrease immunogenicity and antigenicity [83,84]. PEG conjugation (termed PEGylation) has been commonly utilized in order to improve graphenebased nano-carrier functions.\nA pioneering work, conducted by Lu et al. investigated a covalently attached PEG to NGO carrier to deliver molecular beacon (MB), as a model oligonucleotide, into HeLa cells to detect target mRNA. The steric hindrance effect of the attached PEG remarkably hindered DNase I from binding to MB, and consequently protected MB from enzymatic cleavage. Moreover, PEGylated NGO was less cytotoxic even at a concentration of 100mg/ml and target DNA can be successfully hybridized with MB, which was adsorbed on the NGO surface, and then released from NGO [75].\nPEGylated rGO (PEG-rGO) was developed by Zhang et al. for loading and delivery of single stranded RNA (ssRNA) by covalent\nconjugation of PEG to GO and reduction of resultant PEG-GO into PEG-rGO (Fig. 6) [84]. PEGylation and subsequent reduction had no effect on the size, but an increase of thickness from 1 nm (GO) to 2e3 nm (PEG-rGO) was observed. Furthermore, a higher amount of ssRNAwas adsorbed on PEG-rGO in comparison to PEG-GO because of the more noticeable affinity of ssRNA to PEG-rGO. Cytotoxicity studies revealed no toxic effect of GO, PEG-GO and PEG-rGO to HeLa cells, whereas little toxicity was exhibited in rGO. Thus, not only did PEG-modification improve the biocompatibility of rGO, but also significantly enhanced the stability of rGO in biological buffer solutions.\nFig. 6. (a) Viability of HeLa cells 24 h after treatment with various concentrations of PEG-GO of Chemistry. (A colour version of this figure can be viewed online.)\n4.1.3. Dendrimers Dendrimers are highly branched polymers with a spherical three dimensional shape and build up from a central core molecule, which is symmetrically surrounded by branched repetitive units. These structures have a nanoscale size with a high density of positive charges due to the presence of amino groups on the surface [74,122]. Poly (amidoamine)(PAMAM) dendrimer, poly-L-lysine (PLL) dendrimer, poly (prophylenimine) (PPI) dendrimer, poly (etherimine) (PETIM) dendrimer are some used dendrimers, which have been employed as gene carriers [122], among which PAMAM dendrimers have been evaluated as graphene modifier [115].\nand PEG-rGO Reprinted with permission from Ref. [84]. Copyright (2013) Royal Society\nPAMAM dendrimers, which are molecularly uniformwith a unique shape and size have the intrinsic capability for condensation and efficient transportation of DNA into cells owing to the fact that amine groups on the surface of PAMAM dendrimers can electrostatically interact with phosphate groups of DNA at physiological pH. Moreover, the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects, which are exhibited by these PAMAM dendrimers, are relatively low in comparison to PEI since PAMAM, unlike PEI, is a biodegradable polymeric structure in which a backbone of polymer chains with peptide bonds exist [94].\n4.1.4. poly-L-lysine (PLL) PLL is a cationic polypeptide, which is highly positively charged at a physiological pH. J. Sun et al. evaluated grafted PLL-grafted GO to intracellular delivery of immunostimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) [112]. They utilized two GO platforms, polydispersed GO and uniform NGO to covalent immobilization of PLL. PLL modification provided a large number of amino groups, which electrostatically interact with negatively charged CpG ODNs and facilitated the ODNs loading. NGO-PLL-CpG conjugates revealed better biocompatibility and higher cellular internalization in murine Raw264.7 macrophages juxtaposed with polydispersed GOPLL-CpG. In addition, NGO-PLL-CpG exhibited comparably higher immunomodulatory effects than NGO-azide-CpG, which can be due to the adverse effect of azide, as a modifier, on cellular uptake and bioactivity.\n4.1.5. Chitosan Chitosan (CS) or poly-D-glucosamine, a linear cationic polysaccharide derived from chitin, is considered to be an appropriate candidate as modifier for gene and drug delivery because of its properties, such as good biocompatibility and biodegradability compared to other cationic polymers like PEI, improvement of the stability of nano-carriers in aqueous solutions and the ability of surface charge adjustment for electrostatically interacting with negatively charged nucleic acids [114].\nChitosan-modified GO was successfully utilized to deliver nucleotide based immunotherapeutic agents. Zhang et al. developed GO-CS nano-composites through the self-assembly of GO and CS via electrostatic interactions for delivery of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) (Fig. 7) [114]. The resultant GO-CS/ODNs nanocomplexes were stable under acidic conditions resembling the endosomal pH, and revealed good potential of CS for buffering the endosome environment. The biocompatible nature of CS resulted in decreases of GO cytotoxicity, and also enhanced cellular uptake, compared to free CpG ODNs. The more efficient CpG ODNs delivery mediated by CS-functionalized formulation induced a higher amount of cytokines secretion, juxtaposed to GO/CpG ODNs, which indicated CS potential to improve GO function as gene nanocarrier.\n4.1.6. Poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonates) (PSS) PSS is a water soluble polymer, which is non-toxic and could improve the dispersion of graphene-based materials in aqueous solutions and prevent them from agglomeration. Since PSS is a negatively charged polyelectrolyte, it could participate in layer by layer assembly structures via electrostatic interactions. Moreover, the pH sensitive nature of this polymer makes it a suitable choice for releasing the payloads, which are incorporated into the composite in response to the pH change in the environment [123,124]. For gene delivery applications, this polymer was usually employed with other cationic modifiers, such as PEI to make a complex structure, which could provide enough hydrocolloidal stability as well as gene interaction potential [87].\n4.1.7. Poly(2-dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) PDMAEMA, a synthetic water soluble polycationic polymer, is composed of side chains with tertiary amine groups and canmake a complex with pDNA through electrostatic interactions. PDMAEMA has been utilized as transfection agent, while exhibiting a high level of cytotoxicity, which is mainly contingent upon the length of its side chains [109,125e127]. This polymer is able to non-covalently immobilize onto GO nanosheets through p-p interactions and produce a nanostructure with zwitterionic property, due to the presence of amine, phenol hydroxyl and carboxyl groups [109,128]. A biocleavable PDMAEMAeGO formulation synthesized by the disulfide (SeS) mediated grafting method was introduced by X. Yang and his colleagues as very efficient nano-carriers to transfect plasmid pRL-CMV. It is considered as the reporter gene in COS7 and HepG2 cell lines, with a pH-sensitive gene releasing manner [109].\n4.1.8. Peptides Peptides have been used for targeted gene/drug delivery and cell uptake since they are small-sized and biocompatible molecules with cell-penetrating ability and can be chemically synthesized and modified through a relatively easy manner [129]. The peptide could be selected as a nano-carrier modifier with various aims, such as increasing cell penetration, cellular targeting, stimulating endosomal escape and intracellular nuclear targeting [130]. In the last decade, among various peptides utilized for gene delivery applications, cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to intracellularly deliver large therapeutic molecules such as genes. In 2015, we introduced a novel CPP-conjugated GO (GOP), as a gene nano-carrier aimed to improve the transfection efficiency of the GO nano-sheet by R8 chemical conjugation, while improving GO biocompatibility [29]. The effect of conjugation ratio (R8 to GO) on the nano-carrier characteristics, such as particle size and morphology, surface charge, hydrocolloid stability and plasmid condensation ability was comprehensively investigated. The results (Fig. 8) demonstrated that the designed R8eGO nano-carrier with a peptidemolar ratio of 1 mmol per mg of GO (GOP1) was selected as the most efficient and biocompatible gene delivery vehicle having desirable properties as well as efficient transfection ability compared to JetPEI® as a commercial reagent.\nIn another study, Dowaidar et al. combined GO with two different kinds of CPP, PepFect14 (PF14) and PepFect221 (PF221), for gene delivery of three oligonucleotide (ON) models, including plasmid (pGL3), splice correction oligonucleotides (SCO) and siRNA [120]. The CPPs were sequentially added to ONs/GO complexes and physically loaded on the complexes. The result demonstrated that GO-ONs-CPPs offered several magnitude enhancements of cellular uptake and transfection ability (1.5e25 folds) than CPPs-ONs (Fig. 9).\nRecent progresses in peptide synthesis provide the opportunity to design multipurpose peptides, which are suitable for various biomedical applications. Chimeric peptides are one of the best candidates to be utilized in designing gene delivery carriers. For instance, Ghafari and his coworkers introduced and evaluated peptide-modified GQD with two different (green and red) emission colors for gene delivery and nuclear targeting applications as well as cellular tracking [131]. GQDs are physically conjugated with MPG-2H1 chimeric peptide, which was composed of three different motifs. The selected motifs were responsible for the three specific performances aimed to overcome the biological barriers against gene transfer (DNA packaging, endosomal escape and cellular nuclear targeting). The chimeric peptide-modified GQDs provided efficient cell tracking and showed enhanced internalization of the luciferase plasmid into HEK 293 T cells.\n5. Multifunctional graphene nano-carriers\nMultifunctional nano-carriers can synchronously exhibit various functions including drug/gene delivery, optical imaging, induction of apoptosis in cancer cells, increase in biocompatibility, gene transfection and condensation ability as well as stability and solubility within physiological solutions. There exist various advantages of using multifunctional carriers, including the ability of having specific beneficial effects synergically, which can be obtained by less frequent administration of therapeutic carriers, enabling researchers to have more control on vehicles and also achieving more information regarding nano-carriers’ fate in the body [132]. Considering the unique chemical structure of graphene family nanoparticles, they showed a great potential to insert various functionalities in order to achieve a multipurpose nanoplatform for cargo delivery (Fig. 10). Among the graphene family derivatives, GO could provide a suitable platform to immobilize the modifier ligands/molecules on the basal surface as well as the edges of nano-sheets via physical or chemical interactions (Fig. 11, up). Beside p-p interactions, which are mostly utilized to introduce hydrophobic functionalities, carboxyl groups on the basal plane or edges of GO sheets provide more reactive sites for electrostatic or chemical immobilization of hydrophilic functionalities (Fig. 11, down) [133]. However, the other oxygen containing functional groups are utilized for GO modification as well.\nSeveral studies have been dually reported on the functionalization of graphene-based nano-carriers with PEG and PEI polymers [60,85,91,92,96,105,134] or with other modifiers, such as folic acid (FA) [106], chitosan [107] and mPEG-SPA [88]. In 2013, Feng et al.\nproduced covalently co-conjugated PEI (25 kDa) and PEG (10 kDa) nano-GO (Fig. 12), which exhibited superior stability in salts and serum, excellent gene transfection efficiency and decreased cell toxicity with respect to free PEI or GO-PEI [85]. The instability of GO-PEI in the serum, which is mainly ascribed to the protein adsorption on GO via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, were extensively hindered by PEG coating. Increased cellular uptake of synthesized nano-carriers, intracellular delivery of siRNA and also gene silencing, in terms of down-regulating the target gene (Polo-like kinase 1) were observed by the applied dual functionalization. In another study by Yin et al. they investigated the antitumor activities of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) delivered by PEG and PEI dual functionalized-GO after intratumoral administration in mouse malignant melanoma and then infrared region irradiation. The zeta potential of nanosheets increased from 49.08 mV to þ43.13 mV after PEI conjugation, whereas this amount decreased to þ21.02 mV after PEGylation and also to þ7.53 mV after the formation of GOePEIePEG and plasmid Stat3 siRNA complexes. Their results indicated that due to the positive charges, GO-PEI-PEG completely condensed the plasmid Stat3 siRNA, and had no cytotoxic effect even at a concentration of 350mgL 1 and transfected B16 cells with an efficiency of above 60%. In addition, the GOePEIePEG/si-Stat3 complexes significantly diminished tumor size in comparison to PBS, GO, PEI-GO and GO/si-Scramble when injected intratumorally in mouse malignant melanoma. Examinations performed 30 days after injection demonstrated that GOePEIePEG did not produce any toxic effects on liver and kidney organs [60].\nIn another study, PEI and PEG dual-functionalized rGO (RGPP)\nwas evaluated as a gene delivery carrier to deliver gene plasmids and siRNA in 11 different cell lines, compared to a commercial polyalkyleneimine cationic transfection reagent (TR) [121]. RGPP exhibited remarkable delivery ability for both the FAM-labeled siRNA model and GFP plasmid into HepG2 cells and GFP plasmids than TR. In addition, the modified GO nano-carrier interestingly\nprovided about 47.1% transfection efficiency in rabbit articular chondrocytes. However, it provided acceptable GFP transfection of about 27%, 37.2% and 26.0% in A549 cell lines, EMT6 cells and LO2 cells, respectively. The results of the study concluded that RGPP nano-carrier should be optimized for different cell lines.\nModified GO based carriers also showed the potential to be\nutilized in the genome editing approach based on CRISPR/Cas 9 technology. Yue et al. utilized GO-based nano-carrier for CRISPR/ Cas9 complexes delivery in the genome editing approach [135]. In this study, PEI/PEG dually functionalized GO was electrostatically loaded by high molecular weight Cas9/single-guide RNA (sgRNA) complexes, where Cas9 maintains endonuclease activity equivalent to that of its free state. GFP expressing a human AGS cell line, treated by GO-mediated Cas9/sgRNA, showed 39% gene disruption with good cytocompatibility and non-significant cell toxicity.\nPEG modifier alone, not with PEI, was also used dually along with other molecules, including FA and Pyrenemethylamine hydrochloride (PyNH2) [83] and with PDMAEMA [102]. Yang et al. conjugated amino-PEG (NH2-PEG-NH2) to FA and linked NH2-PEGFA covalently to GO to obtain GO-PEG-FA (Fig. 13), in which enhancement of the biocompatibility and solubility and also decrease in toxicity of GO provided by PEG modification were combined with the tumor targeting function of FA. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) was loaded onto the surface of nano-carrier through p-p stacking with the assistance of PyNH2, which was non-covalently coupled onto the GO-PEG-FA without cytotoxic effects. The GO-PEG-FA-PyNH2 showed a good dispersibility in blood. It was found that FAM-labeled DNA was delivered efficiently into HeLa cells by both GO-PEG-FA-PyNH2 and GO-PEG -PyNH2 (FA free) with a faster manner of targeting in GOPEG-FA-PyNH2 [83].\nA combination of photothermal therapy and gene delivery has been reported as a combinatorial strategy against cancer treatment. Graphene and its derivatives are one of the best candidates for photothermal therapy. For instance, FA-grafted PEG (PEG-FA) was assessed to modified GO in order to co-deliver HDAC1 and K-Ras siRNAs to target pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 14, a) [118]. They combined dual gene silencing effects with NIR light thermotherapy and tried to enhance treatment effects. The FA-PEG served as a ligand with a potential of providing hydrocolloid stability and cancerous cell targeting ability, simultaneously. To achieve better transfection ability, the GO-PEG-FA was further non-covalently modified with a cationic polymer, poly-allylamine hydrochloride (PAH). Therefore, the PEG-FA/PAH modified-GO provided a multipurpose nano-carrier to co-deliver the two siRNAs. The results of this study demonstrated that synergistically utilizing the gene silencing potential and NIR light thermotherapy capability provided remarkable anticancer efficacy, consequently inhibiting in vivo tumor volume growth by >80% (Fig. 14, b-d).\nPeptides have also been used with other modifiers including PEI [82,116], PLL [117], PEG [136] and phospholipid-based amphiphilic polymer (PL-PEG) [113]. Functionalization of GO-PEI was performed with NLS peptides in order to carry out nuclear targeting and localization [82] and in another study, with neurotensin (NT, a neurospecifc peptide) mainly due to enhancement of the targeting property and biocompatibility and decrease in the cell toxicity\neffect of PEI [116]. Also, GOePLL was covalently modified with RGD peptides, which were able to target the tumor through interaction with the integrin avb3, which is overexpressed on the cell membrane of cancer cells [117]. rGO-PL-PEG was non-covalently functionalized with CPPs, which could provide buffering capacity and elevate resistance to the acidic endolysosomal environment and, as a result, improve siRNA transfection ability [113]. Ren et al. covalently modified GO with low molecular weight PEI, in order to dwindle the cytotoxicity of PEI 25 kDa and then PV7 was noncovalently incorporated into GO-PEI through three different routes, including after the complexation of GO-PEI/DNA, simultaneously with the GO-PEI and DNA, and before treatment of cells with GO-PEI/DNA. The incorporation of PV7 into GO-PEI 10 kDa reduced the cytotoxicity and also its post-addition and simultaneous addition to the composite enhanced gene expression efficiency, whereas prior-addition revealed slight changes juxtaposed to GO-PEI/DNA [82]. In our recent study, we non-covalently\nfunctionalized rGO with phospholipid-PEG (PL-PEG), which was more hydrocolloidally stable compared to rGO and afterwards, the PL-PEG-rGO was non-covalently modified with R8 CPP (Fig. 15) [113]. The observed good colloidal stability and dispersibility of double functionalized nanosheets in aqueous solutions were the results of steric hindrance, provided by hydrophilic chains of PEG, and the repulsion among positively charged amino groups of PEG. MCF-7 cells, which were treated with rGON-PLPEG-R8, revealed superior viability and proliferation juxtaposed to rGO nanosheets. The results indicated the successful condensation of siRNA on the surface of nanosheets, the complete protection of siRNA from enzymatic degradation and the high transfection efficiency of 82± 5.1%.\nIn a study by Ren et al. dual functionalized GO were synthesized based on the PLL and peptide (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, SDGR) covalent immobilization in order to actively target tumors and deliver antiVEGF siRNA [117]. PLL and SDGRwere utilized to improve the water\nsolubility/loading capacity and targeting ability to tumors, respectively. The results of RT-qPCR and ELISA assays showed that the VEGF expressions in the level of mRNA and protein were remarkably down-regulated by 40.86% and 51.71%, respectively. In addition, the in-vivo experiment on the S180 tumor-bearing mice model revealed that intravenously injected VEGF-siRNA at a dose of 0.3mg kg 1 (once every other day) provided the tumor inhibitory rate of about 51.74% (Fig. 16).\nPAMAM dendrimers have also been employed together with other molecules consisting of PEG [104] and oleic acid [94] for dual functionalization of graphene-based materials as gene carriers. Liu et al. developed graphene-oleate-PAMAM hybrids by chemical adsorption of oleci acid on graphene and then covalent functionalization of graphene-oleic acid with PAMAM. Oleic acid is able to improve gene transfection efficiency, as a result of its strong affinity to the cytomembrane and ability to further the destabilization of\nthe membrane and also provide terminal carboxyl groups for covalent bonding with PAMAM through amidation reaction. Hybrids became positively charged in aqueous solution after modification with PAMAM, which made them appropriate for immobilization of genetic materials. In addition, graphene-oleate-PAMAM hybrids were stably dispersible in aqueous media and showed dosedependent and cell type-dependent cytotoxicity. Treatment of HeLa cells with the hybrids diminished the viability of HeLa cells as the concentrations of hybrids increased, but the viability was still above 80% after incubation by 100 mgmL 1 of hybrids for 24 h. The GFP transfection efficiency of graphene-oleate-PAMAM hybrids was 18.3% in HeLa cells at the mass ratio of 4:1, while it was 9.9% in MG-63 cells at that of 2:1 [94].\n6. Dual gene/drug delivery by graphene-based nano-carriers\nThe nano-carriers potential for the delivery of gene and drug could simultaneously provide much stronger approaches to fighting diseases. Graphene and its derivatives are good candidates for co-delivery of nucleotide based therapeutics along with chemical based drugs due to their huge surface area and unique\nconjugated structure [12]. The strong bonding between carboncarbon atoms, the aromatic structure, presence of free p electrons as well as reactive sites on the graphene basal plane, make graphene suitable for the simultaneous load of hydrophilic and hydrophobic biomolecules via chemical or physical interactions. For instance, co-delivery of anticancer drugs and genes to the cancer cells has been utilized in cancer therapy applications. However, there are few studies on the application of graphene-based nanocarrier for co-delivery or sequential delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs and genes. Results reported by various studies revealed remarkable superposed efficient therapy compared to merely gene or drug delivery protocols alone.\nOne of the common and effective anticancer drugs is doxorubicin (DOX), which has been used in cancer therapy over the past 30 years [137]. CS-functionalized GO was also utilized to co-deliver platinum complexes drugs, including cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin as well as nucleotides [138]. It usually undergoes various biological actions such as binding to DNA-associated enzymes and intercalating with DNA base pairs. DOXwas commonly delivered by graphene-based nano-carrier along with the anticancer nucleotides. Zhang et al. [80] developed a PEI-grafted GO nano-carrier for\nco-delivery of Bcl2-targeted siRNA and DOX. PEI-GO shows considerably lower cytotoxicity and substantially higher efficacy of siRNA, at optimal N/P ratio and then PEI of 25 K. The result showed that sequential delivery of siRNA and DOX by the PEI-GO nanocarrier led to enhanced anticancer activity. In another study, folate conjugated trimethyl chitosan-functionalized GO (FGNCs) was introduced as a capable candidate for the delivery of both anticancer drugs and genes [93]. This complex nanoparticlewas used as a targeted delivery vector for DOX and pDNA delivery to Hela and A549 cells. The higher uptake level in Hela cells with Folatereceptor was evidence for the targeting ability of FGNCs. Cao et al. [97] synthesized a functionalized-GO with FA-conjugated CS oligosaccharide (FACO) including quadruple ammonium groups.\nGO-FACOwas used for sequential delivery of MDR1 siRNA and DOX. The results presented higher cytotoxicity against DOX-treatedMCF7 cells and also rather than DOX/GO-FACO treated cells. In another study, the PEG/PEI/CS-Aco complex was successfully utilized for the delivery of DOX and shRNA to the human hepatic cell line [107]. PEI/ chitosan/PSS/Fe nanoparticles complicated multi-functionalized GO (CMG) were introduced by Wang et al. for the delivery of pEGFP and DOX to A549 lung cancer and C42b prostate cancer cell lines [89]. The DOX loaded nano-carriers (DOXeCMGs) release DOX faster at acidic pH, and are more effective in killing A549 lung cancer cells than free DOX. These results demonstrated the multifunctional capability of CMGs for targeted cancer chemotherapy, gene therapy, and MR imaging. CS-functionalized GO was also\nutilized to co-deliver platinum complex drugs including cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin as well as nucleotides [138].\nZhi et al. [87] prepared a nano-complex composed of PEI, poly (sodium 4-styrenesulfonates), GO and termed PPG (PEI/PSS/GO) to carry Adriamycin (ADR) along with miR-21 targeted siRNA. First, ADR was loaded onto the PPG surface by physical mixing, and then anti-miR-21 was loaded by electrical absorption (anti-miR-21/PPG/ ADR). The superior therapeutic efficacy of this nano-carrier could be exhibited by gene silencing of miR-21 and better accumulation of ADR in tumor cells. PAMAM dendrimer-grafted gadoliniumfunctionalized GO (Gd-NGO) was introduced as a nano-carrier to co-deliver drugs and specific gene-targeting agents to cancer cells [111]. The positively charged surface of this vector was able to absorb the anti-cancer drug epirubicin (EPI) and interaction with Let-7g miRNA. Also, Gd-NGO can be used as MRI-detectable to identify the tumor place. Therefore, Gd-NGO could be a potential vector for both drug and gene therapy and molecular imaging diagnosis.\nIn another study, a PAMAM dendrimer-functionalized GO (GOPAMAM) was utilized to simultaneously deliver MMP-9 shRNA plasmid and DOX in order to enhance the efficacy of anti-breast cancer treatment [115]. The PAMAM-functionalized GO showed the pH dependent DOX release rate. In addition, compared to PEI25k, this nano-carrier interestingly provided more transfer ability as well as transfection efficiency in the presence of serum proteins. It demonstrated that PAMAM could provide superior stability against protein adsorption as well as a high amine covered surface to load much more shRNA. Co-delivery assay results demonstrated that the cell survival rate of GO-PAMAM/DOX/MMP-9 treated MCF7 breast cancer cells was lower than DOX or MMP-9 shRNA treated once, which confirmed the significant potential of breast cancer via the co-delivery approach.\nCombining photothermal therapy and effective gene therapy have shown promising in cancer treatment due to the enhanced combined therapeutic effects [139]. Graphene and its derivatives can also be used in photothermal treatment of cancer because of their unique features like NIR absorbance, huge specific surface area and functional groups [140]. One of the recent works in this\nfield was conducted by Cheng et al. [88]. They used the PEGylated PEI-grafted graphene/Au complex to deliver siRNA to HL-60 cells. Moreover, this complex displayed photothermal response to enhance the gene transfection efficacy. NGO-PEG-PEI is another composite exhibiting remarkably enhanced pDNA transfection efficiencies under NIR laser irradiation [85]. In another study, Kim et al. [92] used the PEGeBPEIerGO nano-composite to deliver plasmid DNA in PC-3 and NIH/3T3 cells. In addition, this carrier demonstrated enhanced pDNA transfection efficiencies under NIR irradiation that showed the ability of using NGO-PEG-PEI as a lightresponsive gene carrier.\nTaken together, the co-delivery of drugs and nucleotide-based therapeutics by graphene-based nano-carriers would have wide prospects for treatment of the target diseases, particularly cancer [13].\n7. Conclusions and perspectives\nTo date, graphene-based nanoplatform applications in biomedicine, particularly gene and drug delivery, have progressively been the focus of interest. The sheet-like structure of the graphenic nanoparticles, which can provide ultrahigh surface area, as well as a purely carbon composition, offer a remarkable advantage to load cargoes with high efficiency compared with other nano-carriers. In addition, relatively easy synthesis and the possibility of chemical modification of such a carbon-based platform, for instance oxidation or reduction, makes it a suitable candidate to design multifunctional nano-carriers. However, regarding the nucleotides negative charge, the most possible interaction of genes with the graphene nanosheet would be based on the electrostatic ones, which are limited by the relatively negative charge of graphene. Therefore, a key design feature of such a nano-carrier is the cationic charge induction via cationic polymer immobilization or cationic functional group insertion on the surface (e.g. amine). As seen in Table 1, cationic polymers, synthetic or natural, have been utilized as modifier to provide electrostatic interaction with nucleotide based cargo. However, these kinds of modifiers could also provide better cell membrane interactions, and consequently\nmore efficient cell entrance. One of the challenging issues in extra-cellular gene delivery with the power of nanoparticles is undesired interaction with proteins, which are available in cell culture media or blood, and result in nano-carrier instability and consequently precipitation before reaching the targeted cells. This is because the large surface area of graphitic nanosheets and surface charge density are very suseptible to agglomeration in such media, particularly after invivo administration. Consequently, minimizing these nonspecific interactions and improving hemocompatibility via surface functionalization with long chain hydrophilic modifiers, which could provide steric hindrance seems essential to developing such carriers in clinical applications. Although PEGylation are commonly utilized for this purpose, and results of various studies showed the effectiveness of PEGylation on biostability as well as biocompatibility, additional investigations on more efficient modifiers, which could provide biostability without interference in cell entrance potential seems a more helpful strategy.\nUnlike chemical drugs, for nucleotide-based cargoes, the intracellular delivery route even toward the nucleus is another restrictive issue, where non-efficient endosomal escape results in such severe cargo damages, and the damaged cargo obviously could not show therapeutic effects. In the nano-carrier design step, considering the intracellular obstacles and providing possible solutions are very important. Although some cationic modifiers like PEI or CPPs could stimulate endosomal escape, the co-delivery of some lysosomotropic agents (e.g. chloroquin, NH4Cl, methylamine) into the cells could likely aid to overcome this challenge. However, the cytotoxicity aspect of such agents should be considered and controlled.\nFrom the synthesis and modification point of view, controlling the size of nanosheets and immobolized ligands’ density per particle are challenging issues, which both effect the nanoparticle biodistribution and cell entrance mechanisms. In addition, nucleotide loading capacity is a function of the size and surface modification density. Non-uniformity usually originated from various synthesis methods or a diverse level of oxidaton/reduction during further functionalization of graphene. For the translation of graphene-based gene delivery systems to clinical applications, developing manufacturing protocols, which could be scaled up based on the laboratory studies, is an unignorable step.\nRegarding the limited cell source (primary or cell line) having been utilized to evaluate the potential of graphene-based nanomaterial as gene delivery vectors, one of the other challenges ahead may be to confirm whether their successful performance is dependent on the treated cell's type or they could be considered as a general platform to transfect all cells. In addition, since in various reviewed reports different eventual treatment protocols (i.e. transfection in presence or absence of serum, different incubation times, pre/post treatment by some reagents) have been used, there is a need for further investigation to find a clear relationship between the applied treatments and the transfection efficacy in order to standardize the protocols.\nAlthough numerous studies of graphene based nanoplatforms as gene delivery systems are currently in progress by diverse research groups, only a few studies assessed the fate of functionalized graphene-based particles through in-vivo gene delivery. Like other nanoparticles, biocompatibility and biodegradation of graphitic nanoparticles are still challenging issues. However, the results of studies demonstrated that biocompatibility is a dosedependent manner and different functionalization could impact its improvement. Biodegradation andmetabolization of these kinds of particles are also under investigation. Although the overall findings of studies have almost consistently confirmed the safety of the modified graphitic nano-carrier at suitable doses, regarding a\nfew in-vivo assessments in their gene delivery applications, these challenges still await more investigations in the future before clinical trial attempts.\nUnder the light of such supplementary studies, it will create hope for the gene therapist to open up promising tools for efficient and safe gene delivery to the targeted cells and tissues.\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare there is no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n[1] D.

    "abstractText" : "Gene therapy, a therapeutic approach based on nucleotide delivery to the targeted cells, serves as a hot spot research. Regardless of recent developments in various nucleotide-based therapeutics, the success of gene therapy in clinical steps is still limited due to less-efficient delivery mechanisms toward the targeted tissue or cells. In recent decades, nanotechnology has provided a remarkable breakthrough in developing safe and efficient gene carriers. Graphene and its derivatives, as sheet-like carbonic nanomaterials, have been progressively utilized in various biomedical fields. Currently, applications of graphene-based platforms extend to gene delivery as nano-carrier. Considering the unique structure and chemistry of graphitic nanoparticles, they provide high capacity for the loading of genes. To improve biocompatibility, biostability, cellular uptake and increase in gene loading capacity, the surfaces of graphene and its derivatives have been modified with various polymers or ligands. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the current status of graphene family nanoplatforms for gene delivery applications with a focus on the main graphene characteristics as gene nano-carriers. We further highlight the various types of modifications and functionalization of graphene, suitable for nucleotides loading and delivery. We finally address the future perspectives and challenging issues of graphene-based gene therapy for prospect clinical applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
