      "text" : "1 Energetic composites based on nano-Al and energetic\nThe limited gas production of Al/metal oxide-based thermites due to lack of gas elements (e.g., C, H, and N) greatly hinders its practical application. By contrast, energetic coordination polymers (ECPs) are rich in gas elements from organic ligands and have the potential to rapidly decompose into corresponding metal oxides with a large amount of heat output. In this work, a novel high-performance energetic material based on Al/ECPs is presented. Al/ECPs binary energetic composites have enhanced heat release, pressure production, and combustion performance owing to the contribution of the “father” ECPs’ thermal decomposition reaction and the “son” metal oxide’s thermite reaction with nanoAl. [Mn(BTO)(H2O)2]n (BTO = 1H,1′H-[5,5′-bitetrazole]-1,1′-bis(olate)) is used as the ECPs in this work. The exothermic peak of the thermite reaction between 520°C and\n2 730°C on the differential scanning calorimetry curves contributes to the high heat output of the Al/[Mn(BTO)(H2O)2]n energetic composites, especially when the molar ratio of Al/Mn is 1.0 (2189.6 J/g). The peak pressure of this composite (3.6 MPa) is 1.5 times as high as that of traditional nanothermite (Al/CuO) with much longer high-pressure duration in the closed bomb experiments. It also exhibits very intense burning and long duration (around 300ms) in opening burning experiments. These results prove that the father-son effect of ECPs is highly significant in developing new-concept Al/ECPs energetic materials for gas generation, heat release and combustion.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "The development of highly energetic materials has become increasingly significant with the rapid global progress in deep-well oil, gas extraction, pneumatically driven robots, advanced military weaponry, and aerospace industries. Nanothermite, which comprises a metallic fuel and an oxidizer at nanoscale, has attracted considerable attention over the past decade. Different nanothermite systems, such as Al/CuO [1-6], Al/MnOx [7], Al/Fe2O3 [8, 9], Al/Bi2O3 [10, 11] and Al/Co3O4 [12] have been reported because of their rapid energy release rate and high theoretic energy density. However, their low gas production due to lack of gas elements (e.g., C, H, and N) limits their application in pneumatic piston of the motor [13], safety-and-arming device [14], rocket solid propellants [15], spacecraft micro propulsion systems [16], and so on. These applications have different requirements for the pressure output performance of energetic materials,\n3 involving total pressure, peak pressure and pressurization rate, which are difficult to meet by traditional nanothermite. Moreover, less gas production of nanothermite also fail the combustion-to-detonation transition process of energetic materials in confined environment [17, 18]. The emergence of energetic coordination polymers (ECPs) provides a solution to the above problem. ECPs, mainly constructed from energetic nitrogen-rich organic ligands and metal center (metal ion or cluster), have recently attracted attention as new highenergy materials [19]. Numerous ECPs have been successfully fabricated and analyzed over the past few years because of their controllable structure and readily tailorable functions [20-27]. They possess abundant gas elements from organic ligands, which allow them to generate large amounts of gas during thermal decomposition, producing extremely high peak pressures [28]. Some studies have studied the gas-output performance of ECPs [29, 30]. Moreover, along with gas generation, a large amount of heat is simultaneously released when ECPs decompose. In fact, many ECPs feature extremely higher enthalpy values than most existing energetic materials, including nanothermite and explosives. For example, [Cu(atrz)3(NO3)2]n [27] and [Cu(Htztr)]n [31] have higher enthalpy of formation and lower sensitivity than CL-20. Moreover, most ECPs can transfer to the corresponding metal oxide because the central metal ions can combine with oxygen from the ligand or the air during their decomposition [27, 31-33]. On the basis of the above advantages, a novel highly Al/ECPs composite was proposed, in which the oxidant in nanothermite was replaced by ECPs. The “father” ECPs can release a large amount of gas and heat during decomposition, and its “son,” the corresponding metal oxide, can further react with nano-Al, which results in a second heat\n4\ncontribution. The gas generation and thermite reaction work synergistically and could greatly promote heat release, gas production, and combustion performance, which are conducive to the formation of high-temperature and high-pressure environment. A very recent report also found that Al/ECPs possess multi-level energy releases [34]. The schematic of the “father-son” effect of ECPs in Al/ECPs binary energetic composites is shown in Fig. 1.\nFigure 1. Schematic of the “father-son” effect of ECPs in Al/ECPs binary energetic composites. The ball-stick model of ECP(Mn) in the upper left corner is quoted from the literature [33].\nIn this work, [Mn(BTO)(H2O)2]n (ECP(Mn), MnC2H4N8O4, BTO = 1H,1′H-[5,5′bitetrazole]-1,1′-bis(olate)) [33] was thoroughly mixed with nano-Al particles by ultrasonic dispersion. ECP(Mn) can reportedly decompose into nano or micron α-Mn2O3 at 500 °C in oxygen and inert gas, respectively. In addition, the organic ligand H2BTO is rich in C, H, O, and N gas elements, which guarantees large-scale gas production. Composed of two coupled tetrazole rings and two hydroxyl groups, H2BTO contains\n5 three types of bonds (N-N, N=N, and N-O) with large energies, which guarantee an ultrahigh enthalpy value. The exothermic properties of the Al/ECP(Mn) energetic composites were investigated, and the pressure output and combustion performance were observed through closed bomb experiments and open burning experiments, respectively."

Further HRTEM observation of Al/ECP(Mn) composite was performed to check whether submicron-sized ECP(Mn) particles were produced after several hours of ultrasonic dispersion, because the smaller ECP(Mn) could provide more contact sites with nano-Al, thus making the Al/ECP(Mn) composite more homogeneous. A cluster of nanoparticles without micro-scale ECP(Mn) are selected for elemental mapping and the results are shown in Fig. 4b. In addition to the Al element, the main constituent elements of the ECP(Mn), such as Mn, C, N and O, were all found to be uniformly distributed, which proves that the nano-Al and ECP (Mn) are uniformly distributed on the nanoscale. However, ECP(Mn) particles could not be identified in Fig. 4a, probably because the π−π stacking and hydrogen bonds between the 1D linear structures have been destroyed by long-time ultrasonication, thus breaking the 3D networks of ECP(Mn) [33].\n11\nFigure 4. (a) TEM image of the Al/ECP(Mn) energetic composite; (b) the STEMHAADF image of the Al/ECP(Mn) energetic composites and the corresponding EDX mapping of Al, Mn, C, N and O elements.\nThe XRD patterns of ECP(Mn) and Al/ECP(Mn) energetic materials are shown in Fig. 5.\n12\nThe XRD pattern of ECP(Mn) is consistent with that in the literature [33], indicating that ECP(Mn) is successfully synthesized. The characteristic diffraction peaks of ECP(Mn) completely coincide with those of the Al/ECP(Mn) sample, indicating that no phase change occurred during the synthesis. The diffraction peaks of Al (pdf# 65-2869) can also be found in the composite, which echoes the EDS mapping results well. To verify whether the corresponding oxide forms after the decomposition of the ECP(Mn), the original ECP(Mn) is heated from room temperature to 520 °C at a rate of 10 °C /min in an Ar gas atmosphere. The heated product is labeled “ECP-520.” It is then characterized using SEM and EDS, and the results are shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. 3b respectively. EDS results demonstrate the presence of Mn, O, and N, where the N content decreases from 27.8 wt% before heating to 6.7 wt% after heating (Fig. S1). This result indicates that the nitrogen-containing group has undergone thermal decomposition, which also leads to the reduced volume of ECP(Mn) in Fig. 2b. The valence state information about ECP-520 is obtained from XPS characterization. The full XPS survey exhibits the presence of C, O, N, and Mn (Fig. S2). The N 1s highresolution spectrum (Fig. 6a) indicates that a small amount of N remains and bonds with metal manganese. In the high-resolution Mn 2p region, two peaks around at 641.2 eV and 653.0 eV are observed, and their splitting width is 11.8 eV, which are ascribed to Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 (Fig. 6b). The multiplet split of the Mn 3s peak in Fig. 6c characterizes the manganese oxidation state. This split is attributed to the exchange interaction between the remaining electrons in the 3s orbital and the other unpaired electrons that have parallel spins [35]. According to the literature [36-39], the Mn 3s split widths of MnO and Mn2O3 are around 6.0 eV and 5.4 eV, respectively. The Mn 3s split\n13\nwidth of ECP-520 is 5.7 eV, between the above two values, which may be because the valence of Mn in ECP-520 is between +2 and +3 or because ECP-520 contains the above two types of oxides. The high-resolution O 1s spectrum is shown in Fig. 6d, which shows that the O 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into three components. The O peak centered at 529.8 eV is probably attributed to the lattice oxygen of amorphous O-Mn3+ according to the literature, whereas the O peak located at 531.2 eV corresponds to the lattice oxygen of O-Mn2+ [40]. The XPS results confirm that the main component of ECP-520 is MnOx.\nFigure 6.

      "text" : "The thermal properties of the as-prepared Al/ECP(Mn) composites are investigated using\n14\nTG/DSC. Figure 7a and b shows the TG and DSC curves in the temperature range of 45°C- 1000°C, respectively. The test samples include pure ECP(Mn), and five types of Al/ECP(Mn) composites with Al/Mn molar ratios of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7a, the weight loss of all samples mainly includes three stages. The first stage is between 160 °C and 230 °C, corresponding to the loss of coordination water of ECP(Mn). Correspondingly, an endothermic peak appears in Fig. 7b within this range. The second weight-loss stage is from about 230 °C to 520 °C, corresponding to the thermal decomposition of the energetic ECP(Mn). The ring opening dissociation of the tetrazole in the ligand produces gases such as N2 and CO2, resulting in weight loss. Accordingly, two adjacent exothermic peaks can be observed in Fig. 7b. No clear boundary exists between the third and second stages for pure ECP(Mn), and the weight tends to stabilize after 860 °C, which may be attributed to the gradual reduction process of MnOx in an inert gas atmosphere. For nano-Al contained samples, the third stage appears around 800 °C, which may due to the reduction of underreacted MnOx. Notably, a distinct exothermic peak appears between 520 °C and 730 °C in the DSC curves for all Al/ECP(Mn) samples, corresponding to the thermite reaction between the nano-Al particles and the MnOx produced by the thermal decomposition of ECP(Mn). Figure 7c compares the exothermic performance of Al/ECP (Mn) and nanothermites through DSC curves. The exothermic peak of Al/MnOx and Al/CuO attributed to thermite reaction appears in a similar temperature range with the second stage of heat release in Al/ECP(Mn), which further confirms that thermite reaction occurs during the heating of Al/ECP(Mn) and proves that the “father-son” effect of ECP(Mn) as mentioned earlier in the Introduction part.\n15\nFigure 7. (a) Typical TG and (b) DSC curves of pure ECP(Mn) and Al/ECP(Mn) energetic composites with different Al/Mn molar ratios of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0; (c) comparison of TG-DSC curves among Al/ECP(Mn), Al/MnOx and Al/CuO; The histograms of the weight loss and heat release of ECP(Mn) and five types of Al/ECP(Mn) energetic composites.\nThe TG and DSC curves show that all samples with nano-Al possess a similar two-step exothermic tendency, and their differences in weight loss and heat release demonstrate the adjustable thermal properties by modifying Al/Mn molar ratios. TG-DSC results are summarized and compared in Fig. 7d and Table 1. The total weight loss decreases as the Al/Mn molar ratios increase. In particular, the total weight loss of pure ECP(Mn) is more than twice that of Al/ECP(Mn) with an Al/Mn molar ratio of 4.0. This phenomenon is because the weight of nano-Al components in the Al/ECP(Mn) energetic composite will\n16\nnot lose during the entire thermal analysis. The exothermic heat is determined by the area integral method, and the heat absorbed during the loss of coordination water is subtracted from the calculation result of the heat release of ECP(Mn) decomposition. As the nano-Al content increases, the amount of heat released during the ECP(Mn) decomposition of six samples decreases gradually. However, the total heat releases of the Al/ECP(Mn) samples with Al/Mn molar ratios of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 are all more than 600 J/g higher than that of pure ECP(Mn). The addition of nano-Al reduces the proportion of pure ECP(Mn), thereby decreasing the heat released during thermal decomposition. However, the utilization of thermal decomposition products fully develops the residual value of ECP(Mn) and increases the overall energy density. The total heat release values of these three Al/ECP(Mn) samples are similar, all around 2100 J/g, which indicates that the Al/ECP(Mn) energetic composite can achieve the best energy release in a large ratio range. In the practical application, the multi-component energetic materials may undergo composition changes due to changes in the external environment or long-term storage, so that the actual exothermic performance deviates from the expected one. Al/ECP(Mn) composite can overcome this problem through the coordination of two kinds of exothermic reactions (i.e. ECP thermal decomposition and thermite reaction), which is of positive significance. For the samples with Al/Mn ratios of 3.0 and 4.0, the total heat release decreases significantly, which indicates that excessive addition of nano-Al results in the mismatched equivalent ratio of Al to MnOX, which leads to insufficient reactions between the fuel and the oxidant, and ultimately reduces the heat release per unit mass of thermite reaction. The DSC results prove that the “father-son” effect of ECP(Mn) can increase the energy density of the system."

In the four FTIR patterns, the broad absorption band in the range of 3000–3800 cm−1 and the narrow band at 1630 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching and bending vibration modes of O–H bonds, respectively, due to both surface hydroxyl groups in the samples and water absorbed by the KBr sampling pellet [41, 42]. For three products of Al/ECP(Mn) composites, the valley between 1000 cm−1 and 435 cm−1 confirms the existence of alumina, and the one at 761 cm−1 can be assigned to the bending vibrations of Al-O bond, whereas the other one at 598 cm-1 corresponds to the Al–O–Al bond in the alumina [41, 43]. In the pattern of the thermal analysis product of pure ECP(Mn), the bands at 654 cm1 and 493 cm-1 can be ascribed to the vibration of Mn-O [42, 44, 45]. These two bands can also be clearly found in samples with an Al/Mn molar ratio of 1.0 but become less noticeable as the nano-Al content increases. This result is consistent with the XRD results. A joint analysis of XRD and FIIR demonstrates that the thermal analysis products of Al/ECP(Mn) composites contain alumina and Mn, which confirms the occurrence of the thermite reaction and further explains the “father-son” effect of ECP(Mn)."

ECP(Mn) sample is found to be incapable of burning or exploding under electric-wire ignition, so no sudden pressure signals are generated, while Al/ECP(Mn) sample is successfully ignited and produces a pressure pulse, indicating that the addition of nano Al particles is conducive to combustion propagation. This may be because the\n20\nfilling and encapsulation of nano-scale Al particles on the gaps and surfaces of microscale ECP(Mn) crystals make the Al/ECP(Mn) composites have a higher bulk density, which is beneficial to mass transfer and heat transfer. As can be seen from Fig. 9a, Al/ECP(Mn), Al/MnOx and Al/CuO can all be ignited and generate pressure pulse in a restrictive environment. The peak pressure of Al/ECP(Mn) is 3.6 MPa, which is 1.4 and 1.5 times higher than that of Al/MnOx and Al/CuO, respectively. This result proves that the rich gas elements of ECP(Mn) can effectively increase the peak pressure during decomposition. The pressure duration of Al/ECP (Mn) is also significantly longer than that of Al/MnOx and Al/CuO, about 1.5s, 0.3s and 0.25s, respectively. Al/ECP (Mn)’s duration time of about 0.3s in front shows the rapid rise and fall of pressure, and the later 1.2s is a slow-decrease process of pressure from 1.4MPa to zero. The marked difference in deceleration divides the Al/ECP(Mn) reaction into two steps: the first step is the rapid decomposition of ECP(Mn) to generate gas and pressure, and the second step is the secondary reaction of nano-Al particles with the detonation products of ECP(Mn), similar to the afterburning effect of aluminized explosives in literature [46-48]. Different from the aluminized explosives, the detonation products of ECP(Mn) contain many fine MnOx particles besides conventional gas products, which can react with nano-Al powder to further extend the reaction time and pressure action time. Overall, the combination of high peak pressure and long duration gives Al/ECP(Mn) composites potential for external functional capabilities. Figure 9b shows the changes in pressure over the period of rapid pressure rise to compare the pressurization rates among Al/ECP(Mn) composites, Al/MnOx and Al/CuO powder. The Al/CuO powder possesses a pressurization rate of about 59.9 MPa/s, which is the\n21\nsmallest of the three samples, probably because the agglomeration of the nanoparticles increases the diffusion length and results in insufficient contact of the oxidizer and fuel. The pressurization rate of Al/ECP(Mn) is higher than that of Al/CuO, further indicating that there are nanoscale contacts between nano-Al and ECP (Mn). The highest pressurization rate is Al/MnOx, which is about 155.8 MPa/s, because the decomposition products of ECP (Mn) is composed of many MnOx particles with a size of less than 20 nm, and the extremely small particle size leads to large specific surface area [33], which is favorable for sufficient contact with nano-Al. In addition, the residual C and N elements in MnOx can prevent the agglomeration of nano-MnOx to some extent, thereby making the nano-Al and nano-MnOx more evenly distributed.\nFigure 9.

The pure nano-Al powder cannot be ignited as a result because the temperature of the heating wire at a current of 1 A does not reach the\n22\npoint where the nano-Al powder can have self-propagating combustion. Figure 10 shows a series of images of the open burning test results of pure ECP(Mn) powder (a) and Al/ECP(Mn) composite (b) with an Al/Mn molar ratio of 1.0. The time interval is 16ms between the two selected successive frames. As shown in Fig. 10a (see also supplementary data Video S1), the pure ECP(Mn) powder rapidly decomposes and releases a large amount of gases upon ignition. This result indicates that the gas elements contained in the ligand of ECP(Mn) are converted into gases. The thrust generated by the gas rushes ECP(Mn) powder out of the crucible continuously. However, no deflagration or combustion is observed throughout the heating process. For the Al/ECP(Mn) energetic composite, a phenomenon similar to deflagration is observed. It exhibits a stable combustion behavior with extreme luminous flame and relatively long duration about 300 ms in this experiment (Fig. 10b, Video S2). Smoke can also be observed around the flame while burning, which is supposed to be a mixture of the fine reaction products and the gas generated by the decomposition of ECP(Mn). The large difference in combustion performance among pure ECP(Mn), pure nano-Al powder, and Al/ECP(Mn) energetic composites highlights the important role of thermite reaction.\nFigure 10. Sequential open burning images of (a) pure ECP(Mn) powder and (b)\n23\nAl/ECP(Mn) composite. The time interval is 16 ms between the two selected successive frames.\nDue to the coordination of the metal centers with the energetic nitrogen-rich ligands in ECP(Mn), these stacked energetic organic molecules are more closely ordered, leading to a higher decomposition temperature and lower friction and impact sensitivity than the single explosives (RDX and HMX) as shown in Table 2. After compounding with nanoAl, the mechanical sensitivity of Al/ECP(Mn) rises a little (still lower than HMX and RDX), but the total heat release is greatly increased due to the contribution of secondary thermite reaction. Compared with the nanothermite (Al/CuO and Al/MnOx) obtained by the same preparation method, in addition to remarkable low sensitivity and high heat release, the Al/ECP(Mn) composites have higher peak pressure and longer pressure and burning duration. In conclusion, the co-contribution of the father ECPs and son metal oxides allows more energy output and enhances the afterburning effect, which makes Al/ECPs a versatile energetic material that combines high energy output, high pressure output, good combustion performance, and insensitivity.\nTable 2.

      "text" : "In this work, the concept of Al/ECPs binary energetic complexes was proposed and further verified using an Al/ECP(Mn) energetic composite as an example. The morphology and composition of the Al/ECP(Mn) energetic composite before and after thermal analysis were studied. DSC measurement of the Al/ECP(Mn) energetic composite confirmed the existence of thermite reaction, which was further verified through the XRD and FTIR identification of thermal analysis products. The effect of different Al/Mn molar ratios on the exothermic properties was studied. The highest heat release reached 2189.6 J/g when the Al/Mn molar ratio was 1.0. The peak pressure and duration of Al/ECP(Mn) energetic composites were highly improved compared with Al/CuO and Al/MnOx powder. The combustion performance of Al/ECP(Mn) energetic composite was compared with pure ECP(Mn) through opening burning experiments, and the flame of the former was violent and lasted for about 300 ms. The excellent energetic properties of the Al/ECPs energetic complexes demonstrated the positive significance of the father–son effect of ECPs.\n25"

    "abstractText" : "The limited gas production of Al/metal oxide-based thermites due to lack of gas elements (e.g., C, H, and N) greatly hinders its practical application. By contrast, energetic coordination polymers (ECPs) are rich in gas elements from organic ligands and have the potential to rapidly decompose into corresponding metal oxides with a large amount of heat output. In this work, a novel high-performance energetic material based on Al/ECPs is presented. Al/ECPs binary energetic composites have enhanced heat release, pressure production, and combustion performance owing to the contribution of the “father” ECPs’ thermal decomposition reaction and the “son” metal oxide’s thermite reaction with nanoAl. [Mn(BTO)(H2O)2]n (BTO = 1H,1′H-[5,5′-bitetrazole]-1,1′-bis(olate)) is used as the ECPs in this work. The exothermic peak of the thermite reaction between 520°C and",
