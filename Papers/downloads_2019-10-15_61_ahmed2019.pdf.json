      "text" : "Nickel molybdate (NiMoO4) is an important material of metal molybdate family and attract great interest in electrochemical properties due to its redox activity [1,2]. NiMoO4 Nanostructured materials have been used widely in high performance supercapacitors [3–7]. Other molybdates (FeMoO4 [8], CuMoO4 [9,10], CoMoO4 [11,12]) and tungstates (e.g. NiWO4 [13], CoWO4 [14], CuWO4 [15]) were also considered as the promising electrode materials for supercapacitors and water electrolysis. Recently, Zhao et al. have reported the NiMoO4 nanorods as the active electro-catalyst for OER in 1 M KOH [2]. So far, NiMoO4 as the HER electro-catalyst is still missing in literature. Therefore, present studies emphasis that NiMoO4 is an important electro-active material for HER in alkaline medium. The hydrothermal method was used very frequently in the synthesis of NiMoO4 nanostructured materials including nanorods [2,16], nanosheets [6], nanowires [3,17], mesoporous sphere [5]. Nano-porous NiMoO4 materials were prepared by nanocasting using SBA-15 [7]. Nano-flakes shaped NiMoO4 particles were synthesized from the microwave method [18]. Herein, we report the molten salts synthesis of ultrafine NiMoO4-NRs at 325 C/6 h and their electro-catalytic performances for HER in alkaline medium."

Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (99.90%, Sigma Aldrich), sodiummolbydate (99.5%, Merck), sodium nitrate (99%, Alfa Aesar), potassium nitrate (99%, Alfa Aesar) were taken in the molar ratio of 1:1:60:60. The resulting mixture was crushed using motor pastel for 20 min and then transferred to closed ceramic crucible. The crucible was placed in furnace and fired at 325 C for 6 h with heating rate of 10 C per minute. The resulting materials were washed by de-ionized water and then dried in oven at 60 C."

A Kratos Axis – Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) was used to analyze the oxidation state of the elements. XPS was performed in an ultra-high vacuum chamber (pressure of 5 10– 9 Torr). The monochromatic AlKa (1486.6 eV) was used as X-ray source. The survey spectrumwas collected in the range of the binding energy from 0 to 1000 eV. The BET surface area was recorded on Micromeritics ASAP-2020 physisorption instrument using nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm.\n2.3. Electrochemical experiments\nThe electrochemical data of NiMoO4-NRs for HER was recorded on three electrode electrochemical instrument (CHI-660E) using\nalkaline electrolyte (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 M KOH). The glassy carbon (0.07 cm2) and Pt-wire were used as the working and counter electrodes respectively. The results were analyzed using RHE reference electrode potential.

      "text" : "The morphological characterizations of NiMoO4-NRs were examined by FESEM and FETEM studies. Fig. 1a shows the FESEM micrograph of NiMoO4, which reveals the formation of rodshaped (1D) particles of NiMoO4. TEM studies of NiMoO4 reveal the ultrafine nature of nano-rods with an average diameter of 50 nm (Fig. 1b). HRTEM micrographs reveal the lattice fringes of NiMoO4-NRs with the d-spacing values of 3.09 Å and 1.48 Å (Fig. 1c&d), which are in good agreement with h2 2 0i and h5 3 0i crystal planes of a-phase of monoclinic NiMoO4. The elemental analysis of NiMoO4-NRs is shown in Fig. 2a. The energy dispersive studies (EDS) of NiMoO4-NRs confirmed the elemental ratio of Ni: Mo of 1:1. The appearance of carbon and copper in the EDS spectrum comes from the carbon coated copper TEM grid. Fig. 2b shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of NiMoO4-NRs with the relative pressure (P/Po) from 0.0 to 1.0. The BET surface area of NiMoO4-NRs was calculated using the P/Po range from 0.05 to 0.35, which is found to be 42 m2/g. X-ray diffraction studies of NiMoO4-NRs reveal the formation of pure phase materials and all the reflections match perfectly with the JCPDS file 86-0361. Fig. 2d shows the XPS survey to confirm the presence of Ni, Mo, and O elements in the prepared material i.e. NiMoO4-NRs. The high resolution spectrum of Ni2p shows the peaks at 855 and 874 eV of Ni2p3/2 and Ni2p1/2 respectively, which belongs to Ni(II) state [19].\nThe core level spectrum of Mo3d shows the peaks at 233 and 235 eV of Mo3d5/2 and Mo3d3/2 respectively, which belongs to Mo(VI) state [19]. A peak was observed at 530 eV for O1s.\nThe electrochemical studies of NiMoO4-NRs for HER were carried out in alkaline medium (0.1 M, 0.5 M, and 1.0 M KOH) using cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Tafel plots, and chronoamperometry (CA). CV plots reveal the excellent electro-catalytic activity of NiMoO4-NRs for HER versus RHE (Fig. 3a). The current densities of the NiMoO4-NRs were observed to be 90, 60 and 20 mA/cm2 in 1.0 M, 0.5 M and 0.1 M KOH, respectively, at the scan rate of 25 mV/s. High current density and low onset potential of NiMoO4-NRs clearly indicate to high HER performance. LSV polarization measurements were also carried out in order to confirm the electro-catalytic activity of the NiMoO4-NRs for HER in 1.0 M, 0.5 M and 0.1 M KOH versus RHE. The LSV polarization studies confirm the generation of high current density of NiMoO4-NRs (Fig. 3b). This is noteworthy that the NiMoO4-NRs also exhibit the low onset over-potential (Fig. 3b). The onset over-potential the NiMoO4-NRs was found to be 41 mV in 1.0 M KOH for HER. The onset over-potentials were found to be 119 and 219 mV in 0.5 M and 0.1 M KOH, respectively, for HER. Tafel polarization curves of NiMoO4-NRs also show very small energy loss during the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reactions. Fig. 3c shows the Tafel plots of NiMoO4-NRs for HER and the Tafel slope values were found to be 71, 133, 460 mV/dec in 1.0 M, 0.5 M and 0.1 M KOH, respectively, for HER. This is remarkable that the results obtained from the Tafel slopes endorse to CV and LSV polarization studies i.e. low energy loss during the electro-\nnd (d) chronoamperometry (CA) of NiMoO4-NRs for HER at various concentration of easurements.\ncatalytic reactions. The stability of electrode materials was analyzed by CA studies for 3600 s (Fig. 3d). CA measurements confirm the stable nature of the electrodes with very small extent of potential energy loss in 1.0 M, 0.5 M and 0.1 M KOH for HER as shown in inset of Fig. 3d.\n4. Conclusions\nThe ultrafine NiMoO4-NRs (average diameter of 50 nm) were synthesized using the molten salt method at 325 C. These NRs show excellent electro-catalytic performance for HER in alkaline medium (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 M KOH) with long term stability. The onset over-potential and the Tafel slope values of NiMoO4-NRs were found to be 41 mV and 71 mV/dec, respectively, for the HER in 1.0 M KOH. Stable nature and high electrochemical performances of the natural abundant NiMoO4 electrode materials could be an ideal choice to replace the expensive noble electrode materials for hydrogen fuel cell applications.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors extend their sincere appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University for funding this Research Group (RG-1439-087).\nReferences\n[1] M.-C.

NiMoO4-NRs exhibit excellent electro-catalytic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in alkaline medium at various concentration of KOH (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 M). Tafel slope and the onset over-potential of NiMoO4-NRs were found to be 71 mV/dec and 41 mV, respectively, in 1.0 M KOH versus RHE. Moreover, we have observed low potential energy loss and high stability of electrodes during the chronoamperometric studies (current density v/s time) at the fixed potential for 3600 s. 2019 Elsevier B.V.
