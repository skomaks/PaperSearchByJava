The effects of nano-graphene addition on the structural evolution, hardness, fracture toughness, and densification behavior of ZrB2–SiCw nanocomposites were investigated. Though all produced hybrid ceramics reached the full densification level, with relative densities of ≥99.9%, a negligible drop was observed in the relative density of the specimen reinforced with 7.5 wt% graphene nano-platelets. After the sintering step and due to the lack of any chemical interaction in the ZrB2–Gnp–SiCw system, no in-situ formed phases were detected by X-ray diffraction or electron microscopy investigations. The incorporation of nano-scale graphene additives resulted in grain coarsening inhibition significantly. The hardness slightly increased from 21.9 GPa for the specimen with no graphene to 22.2 GPa for the sample doped with 2.5 wt% graphene. However, with rising the nano-graphene amount, the hardness remarkably dropped to 16.6 GPa and 19.1 GPa for the samples doped with 7.5 wt% and 5 wt% nano-graphene, respectively. The fracture toughness remarkably enhanced, with a linear trend, by the addition of graphene nano-platelets from lower 5 MPa m½ in the carbon-free ceramic to above 6 MPa m½ in the specimen doped with 7.5 wt% nano-graphene. The identified dominant toughening mechanisms were crack bridging, crack arresting, and crack deflection."

      "text" : "Ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) have constituted study fields for several decades because of their unique combination of engineering and refractory features like high melting temperature, chemical inertness, good oxidation resistance, high thermal and electrical conductivities [1–9]. In particular, zirconium diboride as one of the UHTCs has drawn considerable interest and attention due to their applicability in refractory industries and especially in the aerospace field\nfor extreme environments [10–15]. However, according to the strong covalent bonding, low self-diffusivity, and also the availability of oxide impurities, it is difficult to achieve fully dense pure ZrB2 [16–18]. Consequently, employing high processing temperatures and high external loads are vital for obtaining high-density ZrB2-based ceramics [19–26]. Therefore, both high sintering temperature and pressure are required during the densification process that such conditions result in excessive grain growth and degraded mechanical properties [27–38].\nBesides, the intrinsic low fracture toughness and poor resistance to\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.275 Received 6 June 2020; Received in revised form 24 June 2020; Accepted 24 June 2020\n∗ Corresponding author. ∗∗ Corresponding author.

There are several approaches to overcome the mentioned deficiencies in which the first way is to strengthen by introducing reinforcement. Among carbides, SiC is well recognized as the most commonly used secondary phase in ZrB2-based UHTCs. Not only SiC improves oxidation resistance owing to the protective silica layer formation, but it enhances the mechanical properties due to grain refinement [41,42]. Although such materials have many advantages, their weak thermal shock resistance and poor fracture toughness have limited their usage, especially in extreme environments [43–45]. Recently, the mechanical properties of brittle ceramic composites were improved by adding reinforcements with high aspect ratios like whiskers, fibers, and flakes [46–50]. It is reported that using SiC whiskers leads to the promotion of mechanical properties of ZrB2 [51–54]. The addition of SiC whiskers activates different toughening mechanisms, including crack deflection, crack bridging, whisker breaking, and whisker pull-out, which can be detected during the crack propagation [55–58]. However, degradation of SiC whiskers to particles at high temperatures may overshadow the mentioned advantages and be unfavorable for strengthening [54,59]. Choosing suitable additives as a third phase is a viable method to solve such problems occurring at elevated temperatures.\nAn et al. [60] reported that flexural strength and fracture toughness of ZrB2-based ceramics are enhanced by the synergistic effect of SiC whisker and graphite nanosheets. Zhang et al. [61] showed that adding SiC whiskers and graphite platelets led to an improvement in the thermal shock resistance and fracture toughness of ZrB2-based ceramic composites, whereas flexural strength slightly degraded. Guo et al. [62] attributed the enhancement of fracture toughness in ZrB2–SiC samples doped with carbon to the availability of carbon phases in the form of a thin layer at grain boundaries after the sintering process. Azizian et al. [6] reported the microstructural refinement and enhancement of the fracture toughness and hardness of ZrB2-based materials owing to the synergic introduction of SiCw and carbon nanoparticles.\nNowadays, spark plasma sintering (SPS), as an effective sintering technique for manufacturing fine-grained ceramic materials, uses a direct or pulsed current simultaneously with an external load for rapid densification of UHTCs with fast heating and cooling rates [63–73]. Meanwhile, graphene has found a significant place in the nanotechnological industries [74–77]. The graphene addition enhanced the relative density of SPSed TaC-based composites to 99%, while decreasing the grain size by over 60% and significant increasing the fracture toughness [78]. The addition of graphene was also shown to improve the oxidation resistance of TaC-based ceramics exposed to high temperature plasma flows [79]. Addition of graphene improved the densification and hardness of SPSed TaC–NbC ceramics. The toughening benefits of adding graphene in these materials depended on the orientation of graphene throughout the matrix of composite [80]. Adding graphene had no remarkable influence on the sinterability of SPSed TiC-based ceramics, but it led to the increase in the flexural strength due to achieving a finer microstructure [81]. Density and hardness of SPSed TaB2–SiC composites decreased with the addition of graphene, while around 35% increase in fracture toughness was achieved [82]. The addition of graphene resulted in denser, finer, and more uniform microstructure in SPSed TiB2–SiC composites. The graphene-doped sample showed lower thermal conductivity than the graphene-free one, despite the noteworthy thermal conductivity of graphene [32].\nHere, the effects of graphene as a sintering aid on the microstructure development, densification behavior, and mechanical features of ZrB2–SiCw substances were investigated. For this objective, ZrB2–25 vol % SiCw specimens with different contents of graphene (0, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 wt%) were manufactured by the SPS method. To our knowledge, there is no published report about synergistic influences of SiCw and graphene on the qualifications of ZrB2-based substances produced by SPS method."

The technical properties of the initial materials are summarized in Table 1. Various amounts of graphene nano-platelets (0.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 wt%), together with 25 vol% of SiC whiskers, were coadded to the ZrB2 matrix to manufacture novel hybrid UHTCs. Initially, the graphene nano-platelets were dispersed using the ultrasonic method for 35 min in 96% purity ethanol. Next, the powder mixtures of SiCw and ZrB2 were supplemented to the graphene-containing slurries and blended ultrasonically for an extra 20 min. Afterward, the prepared slurries were dried on a hot-plate magnet stirrer. The dried powder mixtures were passed by a 100-mesh sieve, and eventually, were poured into a graphite mold lined with BN powder and a double-layer of a foil out of graphite. The sintering route was performed in a vacuum SPS chamber (Nanozint 10, Khala Poushan Felez Co., Iran) at 1900 °C for a time of 420 s under 40 MPa."

      "text" : "The Archimedes principle was utilized to appraise the bulk density of sintered ZrB2–Gnp–SiCw nanocomposites. Besides, the theoretical density of the bulk materials was assessed by the rule of mixtures, by presuming the true densities of 2.2 g/cm3 for graphene, 3.2 g/cm3 for silicon carbide, and 6.1 g/cm3 for zirconium diboride, as disclosed in the suppliers’ datasheets. This methodology is useful and precise for the non-reactive sintering processes in producing composite materials. The relative densities were calculated as the ratios of bulk to theoretical density values.\nA chemical software named HSC, which has been developed based on the thermodynamics principles were used for the prediction of any conceivable chemical interactions and the formation of in-situ secondary phases. The sinterability and structural studies were carried out using a field emission MIRA 3 Tescan scanning electron microscope (SEM). A Philips PW1730 X-ray diffractometer (XRD) was used to identify the phases. The grain size of the matrix phase, namely ZrB2, was quantified by the ImageJ software through measuring at least 50 grains of zirconium diboride in the SEM fractographs.\nAn indentation load of 49 N was applied for 14 s on the polished surfaces of the specimens. Vickers technique was used for the determination of hardness and fracture toughness of as-sintered bulks by averaging at least five indentation repetitions. A formula developed by Anstis and coworkers [83] was utilized to estimate the fracture toughness based on measuring the direct crack length (Eq. (1)):\n=K E H F C 0.016( ) ( )C1 1 2 3 2 (1)\nwhere H is the Vickers hardness, C is half of the length of the indentation-generated cracks, F is the force applied by the indenter, and E associates with the elastic modulus of composite estimated by the rule of mixtures. Elastic moduli of graphene, ZrB2, and SiC were assumed\n1000, 500, and 410 GPa, respectively [84]. This technique uses a simplified two-dimensional fracture mechanics scrutiny for the estimation of the indentation fracture toughness of ceramic parts. Such a methodology of toughness evaluation has been reported in the literature referring to the ultrahigh temperature ceramic matrix composites [13,26]."

      "text" : "The morphology and phase characteristics of the graphene nanoplatelets, SiC whiskers, and ZrB2 particulates as starting materials are presented in Fig. 1. The SEM image displayed in Fig. 1a shows that the as-received graphene is nano-sized and morphologically contains twodimensional platelets. The XRD pattern of graphene nano-platelets, shown in Fig. 1a comprises of four identification peaks related to hexagonal graphite. This is a logical outcome because graphene is fundamentally one or several limited layers of graphite. The high purity of initial graphene nano-platelets, as indicated in Table 1, is confirmed by phase analysis. As obviously seen in Fig. 1b, the dominant morphology of SiC material is needle-shaped whiskers. Only the cubic SiC crystalline peaks are identifiable by the relevant XRD pattern. Although such single-crystalline SiC whiskers are ultra-pure, based on the data presented in Table 1 and Fig. 1b, the presence of some oxide layers (i.e. SiO2) on the surface of high-aspect-ratio silicon carbide is unavoidable. As depicted in the SEM micrograph of Fig. 1c, the fine size of ZrB2 particulates (< 2 μm, the majority of the particles are submicron) is in close agreement with the provider's datasheet (< 1.5 μm). Only hexagonal ZrB2 peaks are detectable by the XRD analysis on this material as the matrix of the composite. The presence of B2O3 and ZrO2 oxides on the surface of such particulates seems to be plausible.\nThe relative density variations of ZrB2–SiCw materials based on graphene nano-platelets content are shown in Fig. 2. A relative density of ~100% was calculated for the ZrB2–SiCw composite, which indicates that by SPS at 1900 °C for dwelling time of 420 s under 40 MPa load, approaching the full densification is possible without any graphene as a sintering additive. In other words, the addition of SiCw to the ZrB2\nmatrix is adequate for the manufacturing of fully-dense ZrB2 UHTCs. Sinterability enhancement in the mentioned ceramics can be due to the positive role of SiC whiskers on the eradication of surface oxides covered the ZrB2 powder. The SiCw can chemically react with B2O3 and ZrO2 and reduce them to their primitive form of zirconium diboride. This circumstance can be understood using Eq. (2), which not only results in the formation of ZrB2 but also leads to the release of two gaseous byproducts. Although the generation of such gases may lead to the fabrication of a porous material, the applied load of 40 MPa during the densification step accompanied by the vacuum level supplied in the SPS chamber can expel the gas porosities from the sintered bulk.\nB2O3 + ZrO2 + 2.5SiCw = ZrB2 + 2.5CO(g) + 2.5SiO(g) (2)\nTo determine the possibility of the progression of Eq. (2) in the\nFig. 1. Characteristics of the initial materials: (a) graphene nano-platelets, (b) SiC whiskers, and (c) ZrB2 particulates.\nbinary system of ZrB2–SiC, as well as other probable reactions in the ternary system of ZrB2–SiC–C, or rather, in the hybrid graphene-doped ZrB2–SiCw composites, employing the thermodynamics relationships is insightful. Hence, the plots of Gibbs free energy vs. temperature for any possible interactions in ZrB2–SiC and ZrB2–SiC–C systems are presented in Fig. 3. Based on the depicted plots, Eq. (2) is progressive at temperatures over 1760 °C because of the negative values of relevant Gibbs free energy.\nThe relative density of hybrid ZrB2–SiCw–Gnp material (Fig. 2) comprising 2.5, and 5 wt% graphene nano-platelets are 99.95%, slightly higher than that of the ZrB2–SiCw sample with an RD of 99.9%. Such an insignificant increase in the relative density of graphene-reinforced ceramics may be related to the supplementary role of graphene nano-platelets in the removal of the oxide impurities from the surfaces of SiC whiskers and ZrB2 particulates. Eq. (3) can express this hypothesis, which is feasible at temperatures over 1510 °C, according to the thermodynamical predictions plotted in Fig. 3. It should be noted that, the in-situ synthesis of fine ZrB2 and SiC products by Eq. (3) has a beneficial effect on the sinterability of parent ZrB2 particulates and SiC whiskers.\n8Gnp + SiO2 + B2O3 + ZrO2 = SiC + ZrB2 + 7CO(g) (3)\nAlthough graphene can thermodynamically react with the oxide layer of ZrO2, according to the reductive reaction of Eq. (4), which leads to the synthesis of ZrC at temperatures higher than 1670 °C, such a chemical reaction did not occur in the current work due to some kinetics limitations.\nZrO2 + 3Gnp = ZrC + 2CO(g) (4)\nFig. 2 shows that the introduction of a higher content of graphene nano-platelets (7.5 wt%) has decreased the relative density to 99.75%, which is lower than the RD of the graphene-free sample. The agglomeration of platelets of graphene may be the reason for such drop in the densification progress.\nFig. 4 displays the XRD spectrum of the ZrB2-based composite codoped with 7.5 wt% graphene nano-platelets and 25 vol% SiCw. The other samples having lower amounts of carbonaceous additives were not characterized by XRD, because of the difficulty of their detection. The results unveiled that the identified crystalline phases after the SPS process are exactly similar to those used as starting materials, namely the hexagonal ZrB2, cubic SiC, and hexagonal graphite (graphene). This means that the densification of ZrB2–SiCw–Gnp composites can be considered as a non-reactive process because no in-situ phases were\nsynthesized over the densification step. Moreover, no crystallographic or phase transformations have been\ntranspired, comparing the characterized peaks of the as-received materials with those in the as-sintered composite ceramic. Nine diffraction peaks of the ZrB2 phase as the matrix of as-sintered composite (Fig. 4) are matched to those detected in the XRD pattern of the as-received ZrB2 particulates (Fig. 1c). Also, four identified peaks of the cubic SiC as the reinforcement phase in the SPSed specimen (Fig. 4) correspond to the XRD result of the initial SiC whiskers (Fig. 1b). Only one of four peaks of the graphite in the XRD spectrum of as-received graphene nano-platelets (Fig. 1a) is detected in the as-sintered bulk (Fig. 4).\nThe secondary and backscattered SEM images captured from the fracture surface of the SPSed ZrB2–SiCw-7.5 wt% graphene nano-platelets are shown in Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b, respectively. Both SEM images unveil the approaching near full densification, with a relative density of 99.75%, in the triplet composite. The SEM fractograph in secondary electron mode (Fig. 5a) presents a combination of inter/intragranular fracture, which can lead to the toughness enhancement. Relatively proper dispersion of SiCw and graphene nano-platelets in the matrix is seen in the SEM fractograph in backscattered electron mode. However, the partial agglomeration of such nano-sized two-dimensional carbon additives can be disclosed in the high-magnification SEM fractographs, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. Several tiny gaps between the graphene platelets, with a preserved flaky morphology, are observed in Fig. 5c. Fig. 5d also verifies that the graphene platelets are undoubtedly nanosized. The preservation of the original morphology of the graphene nano-platelets after the SPS process can be interpreted as a justification for the non-reactivity of the consolidation process in the ZrB2–SiCw–Gnp ceramics. Though the in-situ synthesis of zirconium carbide, according to Eq. (4), is reported for some carbon-doped UHTCs [26,43,84–86], the fractographical and XRD studies could not unveil the presence of such a phase in this work.\nThe FESEM micrographs of ZrB2–SiCw UHTCs, including 0–7.5 wt% graphene nano-platelets, are illustrated in Fig. 6. Comparable to the fractographical outcomes presented in Fig. 5, full densification and well distribution of gray-colored SiC and black-colored graphene phases in a light-colored ZrB2 matrix can be seen. A well-connection of different phases together, especially the ZrB2 grains to the SiC whiskers, is a sign of a full progression of the consolidation stage resulted in excellent sinterability in these composites. The agglomeration of graphene nanoplatelets is sensible in the SEM micrograph of specimens containing more carbonaceous additives.\nFig. 7 exhibits the average grain size of ZrB2 based on nano-graphene content in the SPSed ZrB2–SiCw-based parts. The graphene-free specimen with a mean grain size of 5.2 μm has the coarsest microstructure compared to the specimens with nano-carbon additives. Since the starting ZrB2 particulates had particle sizes finer than 1.5 μm, a notable grain growth has occurred during the short-time spark plasma consolidation. The introduction of graphene nano-platelets resulted in a significant hindrance in the coarsening of ZrB2 grains. The incorporation of only 2.5 wt% nano-graphene in the ZrB2–SiCw UHTC decreased the matrix grain size to 4.2 μm, which is ~24% finer than the outcome of the ceramic with no carbonaceous additive. The grain growth could be further stopped by the addition of higher amounts of graphene nanoplatelets. The mean grain sizes of 3.1 and 3.5 μm were measured for the samples doped with 7.5 wt% and 5 wt% graphene, respectively. This observation substantiates the constructive role of graphene nano-platelets on obtaining a fine-microstructure UHTC matrix composites by SPS methodology. Removal of surface layers of boria and zirconia, as previously discussed based on the thermodynamics principles, due to the addition of nano-graphene dopant, has remarkable impacts on the prevention of grain coarsening and consequently the improvement in mechanical properties such as the fracture toughness [87–93].\nThe Vickers hardness variations of the SPSed ZrB2–SiCw specimens based on graphene amount is demonstrated in Fig. 8. A hardness of ~22 GPa was metered for the composite containing no graphene. Our\ngroup already recorded a hardness of ~20 GPa for the SPSed ZrB2based ceramic reinforced with 25 vol% SiC particulates under similar consolidation conditions [85,94]. Hence, it seems that the SiCw has\nenhanced performance, in comparison with the SiC particulates, against the plastic deformation induced by the Vickers indenter. A slight increase in the hardness value (22.2 GPa) was observed by the\nFig. 4. XRD pattern of the SPSed ZrB2–SiCw bulk comprising 7.5 wt% graphene nano-platelets.\nFig. 5. SEM images captured from the fracture surface of the SPSed ZrB2-SiCw-7.5 wt% graphen nano-platelets.\nFig. 6. SEM results of the ZrB2–SiCw bulks doped with various wt% of nano-graphene additive; (a) 0, (b) 2.5, (c) 5, and (d) 7.5.\nFig. 7. Mean grain size of ZrB2 versus nano-graphene content in the SPSed ZrB2–SiCw bulks.\nFig. 8. Vickers hardness of the SPSed ZrB2–SiCw bulk composites versus nanoscale graphene content.\nincorporation of 2.5 wt% graphene nano-platelets to the matrix; however, the hardness dropped to 19.1 GPa, and 16.6 GPa by the introduction of 5 and 7.5 wt% nano-graphene, respectively. Although the negligible hardening effect of 2.5 wt% graphene is not remarkable, such a result can be related to the slightly higher relative density of the nanocarbon-doped sample. The significant decrease in the hardness of specimens with higher amounts of graphene additives may be attributed to the natural softness of the remaining graphene phase.\nThe fracture toughness values of the samples, estimated by indentation technique (IFT), depending on nano-graphene platelets, are shown in Fig. 9. The IFT of UHTC matrix composites intensified linearly from ~5 MPa m½ for the specimen with no graphene to ~6 MPa m½ for the one toughened by adding 7.5 wt% graphene nano-platelets. Such an outstanding enhancement (~30%) in the IFT value with the incorporation of only 7.5 wt% nano-carbon dopant not only is linked to the toughening capacity of nano-scale 2D graphene, but also to the\npreviously discussed role of such carbonaceous additive on obtaining a fine-microstructure. The profitable influences of other carbon materials including graphite [5,85,86,93,95–97], carbon fiber [39,98–101], carbon black [3,6,102], diamond [103], and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [104] on toughening of ZrB2 materials were described elsewhere.\nThe IFT-induced crack path, by a load of 49 N using a Vickers indenter, in the ZrB2-SiCw-7.5 wt% nano-graphene is displayed in Fig. 10. Several deflections, as a prominent toughening mechanism in composites, are observed in the crack trackway due to the interactions with the graphene nano-platelets. The vital impact of this carbonaceous material on the fracture toughness improvement of ZrB2–SiCw ceramics was quantitatively discussed above. Crack bridging can also be seen in the SEM image of Fig. 10. Moreover, crack arresting by the soft graphene phase absorbs the energy of crack and prevents its further propagation. The synergistic appearance of several toughening mechanisms caused a significant intensification in the IFT of triplet ZrB2–SiCw–graphene UHTCs. It should be noted that during the cooling step of the SPSed ceramic composites, the mismatch between the coefficients of thermal expansion of ZrB2 (~6 × 10−6 K−1), SiC (~4.5 × 10−6 K−1) and graphite (0.5 × 10−6 K−1 in a-axis and 30 × 10−6 K−1 in c-axis) [86,105–107] might induce residual stresses at the interfaces. Such stresses generally control the interactions between the indentational cracks and the microstructure of as-sintered composites."

Although no in-situ products were produced over the sintering process, the introduction of nano-scale graphene material led to the eradication of unpleasant surface oxide layers. By the addition of 2.5 wt% graphene, the hardness increased slightly from 21.9 to 22.2 GPa, but, higher amounts of such carbon additive resulted in decreased hardness values, due to the intrinsic softness of graphene phase. The fracture toughness linearly enhanced from ~5 MPa m½ for the composite comprising no graphene to ~6 MPa m½ for the specimen containing 7.5 wt% nano-graphene. The most essential toughening mechanisms in the composites doped with Gnp were detected by tracking the indentation-generated crack paths.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."

    "abstractText" : "In this study, the spark plasma sintering technology was implemented to produce hybrid zirconium diboride ceramics comprising of silicon carbide whiskers (SiCw: 25 vol%) and various amounts of graphene nano-platelets (Gnp: 0–7.5 wt%). The effects of nano-graphene addition on the structural evolution, hardness, fracture toughness, and densification behavior of ZrB2–SiCw nanocomposites were investigated. Though all produced hybrid ceramics reached the full densification level, with relative densities of ≥99.9%, a negligible drop was observed in the relative density of the specimen reinforced with 7.5 wt% graphene nano-platelets. After the sintering step and due to the lack of any chemical interaction in the ZrB2–Gnp–SiCw system, no in-situ formed phases were detected by X-ray diffraction or electron microscopy investigations. The incorporation of nano-scale graphene additives resulted in grain coarsening inhibition significantly. The hardness slightly increased from 21.9 GPa for the specimen with no graphene to 22.2 GPa for the sample doped with 2.5 wt% graphene. However, with rising the nano-graphene amount, the hardness remarkably dropped to 16.6 GPa and 19.1 GPa for the samples doped with 7.5 wt% and 5 wt% nano-graphene, respectively. The fracture toughness remarkably enhanced, with a linear trend, by the addition of graphene nano-platelets from lower 5 MPa m in the carbon-free ceramic to above 6 MPa m in the specimen doped with 7.5 wt% nano-graphene. The identified dominant toughening mechanisms were crack bridging, crack arresting, and crack deflection.",
