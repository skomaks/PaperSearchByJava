      "text" : "Cutting-tool material, attracting much attention of researchers, is an extremely important factor in the fields of high-speed machining. Among cutting-tool materials, Al2O3-based ceramics are extensively applied due to their excellent Vickers hardness and fine thermal and chemical properties [1–3]. Until now, many studies have been striving to explore ways to perfect the mechanical properties of Al2O3-based ceramics. Some methods have been proposed, such as whisker toughening, phase transformation, the particle dispersion, and synergistic effects by various reinforcing mechanisms [4–7]. The addition of nanoparticles (TiC, Al2O3, SiC, TiN, ZrO2, etc.) is an effective method to reinforce Al2O3-based ceramics, due to their small grain size and more grain boundaries of the nanoparticles. Pezzotti et al., who explored the strengthening mechanisms of Al2O3/SiC composites, found that SiC particles tightened the grain boundary and shielded it from possible grain-boundary defects [8]. Deng et al. added TiB2 particles and SiC whiskers into the Al2O3 matrix and discovered that the fracture toughness was significantly increased, which was induced by the additive phases [9]. In 2004, the discovery of graphene enriched the family of reinforcing materials for ceramics [10]. At the same time, graphene attracted increasing attentions due to the large specific surface area, good fracture toughness and electrical properties, etc. Ramirez reported that the toughening mechanism of ceramic composites was the bridging effect by graphene [11]. Porwal claimed that 0.8 vol% graphene was\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1815; doi:10.3390/nano10091815 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1815 2 of 12\nbeneficial to promote the increase of transgranular fracture during the fracture process [12]. Wang [13] and Cui [14] discussed that graphene could induce strong and weak interfaces between the ceramic matrix, which was helpful for improving the ceramics’ properties. Many researchers have reported the synergistic effects of different toughening mechanisms, and some exploratory works have focused on the reinforcing theory [15–18]. Ceramic tools with various reinforcing mechanisms are usually conducive to improving the ceramics properties. However, at present, studies on the synergistic reinforcing effects of graphene and nano-TiC are not adequate. The main sintering methods for ceramics are hot-pressing (HP) sintering [19,20], microwave (MW) sintering [21], and spark plasma sintering (SPS) [22]. MW furnaces are selective to sintered composites, and different composites require different microwave oven parameters. SPS has the advantages of shorter sintering time and lower sintering temperature, which are beneficial in obtaining high-density materials. However, the price of SPS equipment is expensive; thus, it is difficult to realize the industrial production. HP has the characteristics of easy operation and short holding time, etc. Moreover, it does not require the addition of a molding agent, reducing the introduction of impurities. Therefore, HP is an ideal choice for fabricating industrial ceramic composites. At present, few studies on graphene/nano-TiC-reinforced Al2O3-based ceramic-tool materials could be found. In this study, HP was used to fabricate Al2O3-based samples, under vacuum conditions. The effects of graphene and nano-TiC on the microstructure were studied, and the optimal material composition was obtained. Finally, some reinforcing mechanisms induced by graphene and nano-TiC were analyzed."

However, nano-TiC agglomerates along grain boundaries of the ceramic matrix (Figure 6e) with the increase of nano-TiC content, making it more prone to collective spalling. Thus, the mechanical property decreases with the adding of much more nano-TiC. As shown in Figure 7, nano-TiC is dispersed in the matrix grains (marked with green circles) and along grain boundaries (marked with blue circles). The thermal expansion coefficients of the Al2O3 matrix and nano-TiC are different at 8.6 × 10−6 K−1 and 7.6 × 10−6 K−1, respectively. Thus, small nano-TiC is enclosed by large Al2O3 grains or distributed along grain boundaries. Meanwhile, if the nano-TiC is in the crack propagation path, the crack can easily reach the nano-TiC/matrix interface. At this time, the crack will be pinned if the external force does not increase, which is the toughening mechanism of the “crack pinning”. If the external force continues to increase, the crack could pass through the grains, leading to transgranular fracture, or the crack deflection will continue to expand along grain boundaries, leading to intergranular fracture. In addition, as marked with red arrows in Figure 7a, some holes are left due to the peeling of nano-TiC, indicating a characteristic of intergranular fracture. It can be seen that some fracture surfaces are smooth and flat, indicating the existence of transgranular fracture. Thus, it can be concluded that the fracture modes are a mix of intergranular and transgranular fracture.\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1815 7 of 12\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, x 7 of 13"

SEM morphology and element distribution of points 1, 2, and 3.\nAs shown in Figures 4e and 7a, graphene and nano-TiC are pulled out from the ceramic matrix under the action of loading, which is considered as a reinforcing mechanism. This reinforcing mechanism can be explained by the following formula [39]: \uD835\uDF0F = \uD835\uDF0E \uD835\uDC514\uD835\uDC3F (4) where τ is the interfacial shear strength, σf is the tensile strength of the additive phase, d is the diameter of the additive, and L is the pull-out length of the additive phase. In addition, from Figure 10a–d, crack bridging, graphene break, and crack guiding are observed in the indentation surfaces after polishing. There are usually two morphologies of graphene in ceramics. One is perpendicular to the direction of the sintering pressure, while the other is parallel to the direction. Figure 10a,b presents two different patterns of crack bridging. The existence of graphene adds a “bridge”, which could limit further propagation of the crack. From Figure 10a, it can be seen that the crack propagates along a straight line, without deflection. This can be explained by the fact that the strong interface bonding strength is generated between matrix and graphene. Due to the fine ductility and strength, graphene could be a good agent to transfer stress from the matrix, which is beneficial to consume the fracture energy and strengthen the ceramic materials. When the interface bonding strength is higher than the tensile strength, the graphene break always occurs as shown in Figure 10c. The process of graphene break could consume more fracture energy, which can be explained the fact that graphene is known as the material with higher tensile strength (~130 GPa) and Young’s modulus [40], much higher than that of the ceramic matrix. The strong bonding interface induced by graphene results in crack bridging and graphene break, while the weak bonding interface causes crack guiding (Figure 10d). It is observed that the crack propagates along the edge of graphene, which is much longer for the large 2D surface of graphene (demonstrated in Figure 1b). As studied by Walker [41], the crack deflects not only in the 2D plane but also in the 3D space, due to the introduction of graphene. It is demonstrated that graphene is more helpful in increasing the dissipation of fracture energy in the 3D deflection space than fibers or carbon nanotubes. From Figure 10e, the plane heights of the side surfaces of the graphene are significantly different, which confirms the statement to a certain degree. On the other hand, grain refinements are conducive to improving the flexural strength of ceramics, according to the Hall–Petch formula (from Equation (3)). The addition of graphene reduces the grain size, which also can strengthen ceramic materials. As for the effects of nano-TiC, the typical reinforcing mechanism of crack bridging is observed in Figure 10f. The distance between the two sides of the cracks could not expand, due to the effect of “crack bridge”. Thus, sufficient fracture energy is consumed, and the mechanical properties are improved for ceramics. In addition, nanoparticles cause crack deflection universally, as marked with a yellow circle in Figure 10g. It is believed that the weak bonding interface and discontinuity of the microstructure [42] causes the phenomenon of crack deflection. Figure 10h illustrates a common mechanism in ceramics, namely crack branching. It can be seen that the second crack is not very long, which also helps to consume the fracture energy. However, the reinforcing effects are limited when the nano-TiC content is too high. Figure 10i presents a “river pattern” perpendicular to the crack, which is believed to be the peeling of many nanoparticles. Perhaps it is the reason for the low mechanical properties for composite E.\nFigure 9. SEM morphology and element distribution of points 1, 2, and 3.\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1815 9 of 12\nAs shown in Figures 4e and 7a, graphene and nano-TiC are pulled out from the ceramic matrix under the action of loading, which is considered as a reinforcing mechanism.

    "abstractText" : "Graphene and nano-TiC, which have good reinforcing effects on Al2O3-based ceramic-tool materials, are generally used as additive phases for ceramics. In this study, nine kinds of samples were sintered, to investigate the effects of graphene and nano-TiC on the reinforcing mechanisms of Al2O3-based ceramics. The experimental results indicated that adding 0.5 vol% graphene and 10 vol% nano-TiC can obtain the optimum flexural strength, fracture toughness, and Vickers hardness, which were 705 ± 44 MPa, 7.4 ± 0.4 MPa m1/2, and 20.5 ± 0.8 GPa, respectively. Furthermore, the reinforcing mechanisms of crack bridging, pull-out of graphene, and pull-out of nano-TiC are identified, which are contributed to improving the mechanical properties of ceramics. Meanwhile, other reinforcing mechanisms induced by graphene (graphene break, crack guiding, and 3D propagation) and nano-TiC (crack branching, crack deflection, and peeling) are discussed. These reinforcing mechanisms are coupled together, while decoupling is hard to work out. Thus, further quantitative studies of reinforcing effects of graphene and nano-TiC on Al2O3-based ceramic-tool materials are necessary to be carried out.",
