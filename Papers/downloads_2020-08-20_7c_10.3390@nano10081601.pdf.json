      "text" : "Fuel cells are promising candidates to provide sustainable and efficient energy supply for advanced portable electrical vehicles and electronic devices [1]. A catalysis reaction occurs between fuel (methanol, ethanol and molecular hydrogen) at anode and molecular oxygen at cathode, which converts chemical energy into electrical energy via electrochemical processes [2]. These cells have proved ideal energy conversion devices and assured appropriate electrical supply for the generation of power. Although the initial development of fuel cells was based on large scale application with the ultimate emphasis on the development of high energy cells (200–300 kW), now intense development of smaller fuel cells (50–75 kW) is dominating due to the edge of their low emission characteristics [3]. Though fuel cells put forward the most clean possible power production with much lower emissions of greenhouse\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1601; doi:10.3390/nano10081601 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1601 2 of 18\ngases and are efficient in energy conversion of fuel into power in contrast to thermal power plants and gasoline engines, the commercial potential of fuel cells depends on its ability to decrease the cost and use of expensive materials like catalysts [4]. The incentive is to shift away from fossil fuels and hydrocarbons to solve the environmental pollution-related issues. The establishment of a never ending source of energy, mitigating environmental pollution and consumption of fossil fuels, to support an increasingly flourishing world are among the most influential issues in recent years [5]. The rapidly increasing energy crisis of the world means we are in search of alternate energy sources due to the rapid development of portable electric devices and electronic vehicles [6]. DMFCs have gained numerous attentions by its convenient fuel transportation, low environmental pollution, high energy conversion, suitable supply and storage [7]. According to the survey, the fuel cell marketplace for power generation projects and contracts funded with ~$100 million in 2003 [8]. Numerous electro catalysts have been applied to oxidize methanol but the highest electro catalytic activity is achieved by Pt-based alloys. Being an inert metal, platinum offers definite advantages in the applications of fuel cells, like compliance in acidic electrolytes [9,10]. Although Pt and Pt-based catalysts are common and efficient for catalysis, there are still some significant obstacles plaguing in the use of such catalysts like high cost, limited availability, poor stability and susceptibility towards methanol crossover [11]. Moreover, the kinetics of methanol oxidation slow down the adsorption of carbon monoxide on Pt surface; when Pt interacts with oxygen containing carbon species (mainly CO) produced in methanol, oxidation is so strong that active sites of Pt are covered and blocked which lead to recession of activity [12–14]. Yet these obstacles have been reduced by non-precious and more economical metal catalysts like nickel-, iron-, cobalt- and copper-based compounds and their composites with graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and carbon nano tubes etc. [15] also reported as a major competitor to those composites which are based on Pt nanoparticles [16]. Catalytic oxidation of methanol produces hydrogen ion and CO2 which can be represented as [17]\nCH3OH + H2O→ CO2 + 6H+ + 6e− Eo = 0.02 V (1)\nThe methanol oxidation reaction over metal catalysts is both practically and significantly attractive. These reactions may produce a vast variety of products, like methyl formate, dimethyl ether, formaldehyde, dimethoxymethane, and formic acid. The selectivity depends on conditions of the reaction such as, partial pressure of the reactants, conversion and reaction temperature [18]. Copper provides significant electro catalytic activity when it comes to oxidation but by adding a small amount of good alloying materials to copper has been reported to give a dramatic increase in its electro catalytic activity as compared to pure copper electrode material. For instance, adding 5% of Mn to Cu, represented as Mn5Cu95, shows a significant improvement in glucose oxidation occurring electrochemically in alkaline media [19]. Nickel acquires significant attention as a catalyst due to its surface oxidation properties i.e., inter conversion of Ni2+ and Ni3+ [20]. Many nickel-involving materials have been served as catalysts in various fuel cells, and nickel has been widely used as an electro catalyst for both cathodic as well as anodic reactions in electrolysis of water and organic synthesis [21]. Van Effen and Evans reported ethanol oxidation in KOH solution that results in the production of nickel oxide with higher valency that serves as an oxidizing agent. The fact was supported by impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry [22]. There is a vast variety of compositions of Ni/Cu alloys due to the fact that, in pure form, both metals (i.e., Nickel, Copper) have the same face centered cubic (fcc) arrangement with the same lattice parameters (α = 3.523 for Ni and α = 3.616 for Cu). Khulbe et al. presented an excellent review on the behavior of Ni/Cu alloys in various catalytic mechanisms such as conversion of ortho-para hydrogen, H2/D2 exchange reaction and some hydrogenation reactions [23]. Carbon-supported materials have high surface and area are widely used to catalyze electrochemical oxidation reaction of methanol [24]. Graphene-based compounds are appreciated in this regard due to their efficient conductance, low cost, large surface area and high mechanical strength. Furthermore, graphene-based catalysts increase electron and mass transport of reactants [25]. In comparison to\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1601 3 of 18\nreduced graphene oxide (rGO), graphene oxide (GO) shows less efficiency so reduction process is required to obtain better properties with the aid of a reducing agent for the elimination of functional groups of oxygen [26]. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) illustrate remarkable electro catalytic activities for oxidation of alcohols [27]. MOFs have some unique properties that make them appreciable catalysts for the previously mentioned reaction. Firstly, they acquire surface areas in the range of 500–6500 m2 g−1 and pore sizes of about 3–35 Å [28]. Secondly, the surface properties of MOFs can be altered by versatile organic ligands that bear different functional groups on the surface channel. Sites for adsorption of gas can be introduced in MOFs which gives selectivity for adsorbents and a versatile range of storage capacities [29]. The major purpose of this work is to analyze the electrochemical oxidation reaction of methanol on novel NiO/CuO bimetallic MOF and its composites with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 wt% rGO in a solution of 3M methanol and 1M NaOH."

Current density of bare electrode was 0.81 µA/cm2 as shown in Figure 5a. Concentration studies for NiO/CuO MOF were carried out at various catalyst loadings such as 1.0 mg, 2.0 mg and 3.0 mg as illustrated in Figure 5b, which clearly shows the gradual increase in current density with more active sites available for methanol oxidation reaction ultimately enhancing the catalytic activity [50]. Gradual increase in peak current density with increased concentration of rGO in comparison to pure NiO/CuO MOF can be shown in Figure 5c. This means that rGO shows active performance towards methanol oxidation reaction [51]. This characteristic is important for its electrochemical application in fuel cells [50]. The improved electro catalytic activity of NiO/CuO MOF with rGO composite is due to their synergic effect. Presence of rGO increased the surface area of the catalyst and also supported their charge transfer properties [42]. Pure NiO/CuO MOF shows current density of 67.48 mA/cm2 at scan rate 50 mV/s. NiO/CuO MOF with 5 wt% rGO shows a maximum current density at 50 mV/s of 437.28 mA/cm2 at 0.9 V. With the gradual increase in amount of rGO, peak current density rises to the following levels: 145.5 mA/cm2 for 1 wt%, 259 mA/cm2 for 2 wt%, 264.57 mA/cm2 for 3 wt%, and 324 mA/cm2 for 4 wt% at a scan rate of 50 mV/s.

This increased response of 5 wt% rGO composites clearly shows that it lowers the activation energy required for methanol oxidation reaction. Nanomaterials 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 20 2. This increased response of 5 wt% rGO composites clearly shows th t it lowers the activat on energy required for methanol oxidation reaction. rGO–NiO/CuO MOF (8 wt%) was also tested for the optimization purpose of reduced graphene oxide in a methanol oxidation reaction as shown in Figure 5c. In this case, obtained results were out of trend as it shows lower current density than 5 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF. Most probably this is due to the fact that the large amount of rGO results in incomplete dispersion at the time of synthesis which led to covering of the surface of the MOF which blocked the pores and catalytic sites of the catalyst and lowered its performance [34,52]. So, it is suggested that current density can be enhanced by increasing rGO to a certain limit; although, increasing quantity of rGO may have a negative effect on current density.\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500 (c)\nC ur\nre nt\nd en\nsi ty\n(m A\n/c m\n2 )\nVoltage (Ag/AgCl)\nNiO/CuO MOF 1 wt% rGO-NiO/CuO MOF 2 wt% rGO-NiO/CuO MOF 3 wt% rGO-NiO/CuO MOF 4 wt% rGO-NiO/CuO MOF 5 wt% rGO-NiO/CuO MOF 8 wt% rGO-NiO/CuO MOF\nFigure 5.

So, it is suggested that current density can be enhanced by increasing rGO to a certain limit; although, increasing quantity of rGO may have a negative effect on current density. Figure 6 illustrates a linear relationship of current density of NiO/CuO MOF and their composite 1–5, 8 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF with increasing scan rate values i.e., 50 mV/s, 100 mV/s, 150 mV/s, 200 mV/s. It was observed that both the peak current density and peak potential were altered by scan rates. With the increase in scan rate the peak current density increases indicating progressive improvement in the electro active specie access towards the electrode surface. Meanwhile the peak potentials shift towards lower negative values, indicating the structural change in the electrochemically formed surface film and saturation of active sites on modified GCE surface was a result of the shifting of peak potential to a more positive value [53]. At higher scan rates, non electro active species were not undergoing oxidation or reduction which resulted in increases in peak current density, suggesting that only electro-active products were formed [54]. In addition, an increase in the scan rate probably improved the electron movement [55]. By comparing the results with gradual increase in scan rate, it was observed that for NiO/CuO MOF, along with all composites, the current density increased accordingly from 50 to 200 mV/s as per expectations. Movement of electrons enhanced by the increasing the scan rate [55] provide another supportive item of evidence for the increase in current density. The increases in peak potential shift and peak current density were more prominent in the 5 wt% rGO/NiO/CuO MOF catalysts compared to the NiO/CuO MOF and other rGO–based composites i.e., 1–4 wt%, 8 wt% rGO/NiO/CuO MOF catalyst, representing better efficiency of the catalysts synthesized by the hydrothermal method.

Catalytic sites were vacant at the start of the reaction and were freely available for coverage of methanol but with the passage of time an equilibrium layer of methanol developed on the surface which slowed down the process [64,65].

Table 4 exhibits imperative EIS parameters for bare and modified GCE in comparison to a bare working electrode, all synthesized catalysts i.e., NiO/CuO MOF, along with their composites 1–5 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF show low charge resistance and among all combinations, 5 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF shows the lowest Rct (charge transfer resistance) value.\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1601 14 of 18\nThe stability of electro catalysts was observed through chronoamperometry by using the same three-electrode system at a constant voltage of 0.9 V in 3M methanol and 1M NaOH solution as shown is Figure 9a. In the first 60 s there is an initial drop in current density observed mainly because of intermediate reactions i.e., (Co, CHO, COOH) adsorption on catalysts’ surface, after which the current density decreases steadily and reaches a quasi-stationary state until 3600 s. Catalytic sites were vacant at the start of the reaction and were freely available for coverage of methanol but with the passage of time an equilibrium layer of methanol developed on the surface which slowed down the process [64,65]. After applying the set potential for 3600 s, the maximum current density value is (469.4 mA/cm2) for 5 wt% rGO-NiO/CuO MOF, followed by 4 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF (306.2 mA/cm2), 3 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF (207.2 mA/cm2), 2 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF (203.2 mA/cm2), 1 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF (136 mA/cm2) and NiO/CuO MOF (106.5 mA/cm2). While stability of 8 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF was also investigated, this shows a current density value (199 mA/cm2) which is comparable with its CV results.

The catalyst 5 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF which shows highest curren density shows highest stability a ong all the catalysts up to 52% during the time period of 3600 s followed by 4 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF (47%), 3 wt% rGO– NiO/CuO MOF (43%), 2 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF (33%), 1 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF (29%), NiO/CuO MOF (27%) and 8 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF (31%). The above mentioned performance of all samples clearly indicates that addition of rGO in NiO/CuO MOF to a certain limit will assist with the methanol oxidation reaction.\nFigure 9.

It is reported that methanol oxidation overall process undergoes subsequent necessary elementary steps like methanol adsorption, methanol dehydrogenation into intermediates, and oxidation of these intermediates eventually into carbon dioxide. The process of adsorption occurs in the voids of NiO/CuO MOF, which is further improved by the presence of rGO. For the ease of methanol adsorption and other successive elementary steps for methanol oxidation, surface area of rGO sheets and metal–organic framework porosity aids the process well. Furthermore, adsorption of water molecules in pores of MOF also facilitates the oxidation of intermediates into CO2 [66,67].\nA summarized mechanism showing the overall procedure of electrochemical reactions for methanol oxidation on the catalyst surface in 3 M methanol and 1 M NaOH is provided below in Figure 10.\nFigure 9b shows % stability with reference to other samples.

Conclusions\nIn summary, this work demonstrated a successful in situ synthesis of novel bimetallic NiO/CuO MOF and its composites i.e., 1–5, 8 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF by economic one-pot hydrothermal method. The confirmation for the coordination of NiO and CuO with BDC and pyrazine ligands was achieved by structural characterizations like FTIR, PXRD, SEM and EDX. Among all synthesized series of catalysts, 5 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO MOF showed the best electrochemical activity with the highest current density of 437.28 mA/cm2 at 0.9 V potential, exhibiting low impedance and stability up to 52%. rGO–NiO/CuO–MOF (8 wt%) was also synthesized to optimize the rGO concentration, the catalyst exhibits inferior catalytic activity as compared to 5 wt% rGO–NiO/CuO–MOF due to the higher amount of rGO which resulted in agglomeration. These properties make this bimetallic NiO/CuO MOF a promising alternative to the expensive catalysts for DMFC.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at www.mdpi.com/xxx/s1, Figure S1 TGA analysis of pure NiO/CuO MOF.\nAuthor Contributions: Data curation, S.P. and N.Z.; Methodology, T.N., S.P. and N.Z.; Project administration, T.N.; Supervision, T.N., N.I. and H.N.; Writing—original draft, S.P. and T.N.; Writing—review and editing, T.N., N.I., E.P., M.S. and H.N.

The composites of NiO/CuO MOF with different amounts of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were synthesized through a hydrothermal method and subsequently characterized by multiple significant techniques like XRD, SEM, EDX, FTIR and Raman IR for an investigation of their structural and morphological properties. The prepared series of material was later employed for electrochemical oxidation of methanol, tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in basic medium on a modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The electrochemical response depicts that increasing concentration of rGO enhances the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The catalyzed oxidation reaction of methanol by NiO/CuO MOF and rGO-NiO/CuO MOF composites give a superlative current density of 437. 28 mA/cm2 at 0.9 V potential at 50 mV/s scan rate. This activity makes it a promising catalytic material for electrolysis of methanol in direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC).",
