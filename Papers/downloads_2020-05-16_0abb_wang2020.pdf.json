Nano drug depots, characterized by core-shell structures with core drug reservoirs, are drawing increasing attention because of its potential applications in furnishing drug-sustained release profiles. In the present study, two kinds of nano drug depots, one containing a crystal drug reservoir and the other having a medicated composite drug reservoir, were prepared through modified triaxial electrospinning. Their drug-sustained release performances were compared in terms of initial burst release, middle linear release, and the late tailing off release. Although both depots had a linear morphology, clear core-shell nanostructures and the same cellulose acetate shell layer, they provided considerably different tailing off release performances, and thus different sustained release profiles. The composite-based drug depots showed a smaller tailing off drug amount of 2.2%, a shorter time period of 12 h, and a better zero-order controlled release kinetics in general than the crystal-based drug depots, whose tailing off amount was 9.3% over a time period of 36 h. The mechanism was proposed, which had a close relationship with the state of drug in the core reservoir. The present protocols open a new way for producing medicated structural nanomaterials."

      "text" : "Sustained release is the most common and popular drug controlled release profiles among all kinds of release rate-related profiles, such as immediate drug release, pulsatile release, bi-phasic release, and delayed release [1–8]. The reason is the constant release rate, which results in a constant blood drug concentration to ensure a safe and efficacious therapeutic effect and enables “one administration for a whole day” [9–14]. Thus, almost all the material fabrication methods have been once used in generating advanced drug delivery systems with drug sustained release profiles [15–18].\nShown in Fig. 1, electrospinning, a “sister” method of electrospraying, takes advantages of the interaction between a liquid and the electrical field [19–21]. The first application of electrospun polymeric nanofibers in the field of pharmaceutics was in 2002 and merely aimed\nat drug-sustained release, in which electrospun poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate), poly(lactic acid), and their blend nanofibers were utilized for the sustained release of tetracycline hydrochloride [22]. After this concept demonstration with a single-fluid blending process and with the progress of electrospinning itself, many strategies have been established to verify the usefulness of electrospun medicated nanofibers as drug-sustained release materials [23–27].\nAs for nanofibers fabricated using the traditional blending singlefluid electrospinning, strategies for furnishing sustained release are mainly dependent on the physicochemical property of host filamentforming polymeric matrices. For example, insoluble and biodegradable polymers are frequently utilized as polymeric carriers for the preparations of drug sustained release nanofibers [28–30]. In soluble polymerbased nanofibers, cross-linking is often needed as an after-treatment method [31].

However, these nano products often have inevitable disadvantages, for example, uncontrollable initial burst release (owing to abundant surface drug distributions and very short drug molecule diffusion distances) and long period of tailing off release (due to small drug distributions and long drug molecule diffusion distances in the central sections) [28].\nDouble-fluid coaxial electrospinning and modified coaxial electrospinning have greatly expanded the applications of core-shell nanostructures in providing sustained release profiles of a wide variety of active pharmaceutical ingredients [33–39]. Apart from the properties of polymeric matrices and the incorporation of other sustained release nanoparticles, the spatial position of components and drug depots with drug reservoirs are novel tools for developing new types of drug-sustained release nanofibers [40]. These core-shell nanofibers can completely eliminate initial burst release profiles and thus eliminate overdose toxicity [41–43]. However, late tailing off or leveling off release remains because of several reasons, such as the long diffusion distance of drug/water molecules and decrease in drug-loaded surface area as the dissolution process progresses.\nFor the prevention of tailing off release, which indicates invalid drug release and waste of active ingredients, strategies utilizing triaxial electrospinning and the tri-layer core-shell nanofibers can be used to provide linear (or zero-order) drug release, which is the best drug sustained release profile [28]. These strategies include drug gradient distribution, the insertion of a middle hydrophobic layer, advanced drug depots, and their combinations [28,40,43–47].\nHere, we demonstrate a novel strategy for producing cores-shell drug nano depots through a modified triaxial electrospinning process. Nano drug depots have been a focus of research on drug-sustained release [48,49]. A traditional drug depot often contains a nano crystal drug reservoir as a core section [40,50,51]. Here, the prepared depot is characterized by a drug-polymer composite reservoir and demonstrated to provide a zero-order drug sustained release with a less late tailing off effect. Cellulose acetate (CA), a cellulose derivative, was exploited as the shell section of the two kinds of drug depots, which are frequently utilized as drug sustained release carriers, in the form of particles, films,\nor nanofibers, in the pharmaceutical industry. Tamoxifen citrate (TAM) which is a frequently used anticancer drug and shows sustained release, was exploited as a model drug. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), a hydrophilic polymer that enhances the dissolution of over 140 poorly watersoluble drugs [52] was used in preparation of the core composite drug reservoirs in composite-based drug depots."

      "text" : "The development of electrospinning from a traditional single-fluid blending process to a double-fluid coaxial and finally to a three-fluid coaxial process is characterized by the key element in an electrospinning system, that is, the spinneret. Among the four fundamental parts constituting an electrospinning system, the spinneret is the most innovative modification [53–58]. In a tri-layer coaxial (abbreviated as triaxial) electrospinning system, a tri-layer concentric spinneret is indispensable, which can be exploited as a template for guiding outer, middle, and inner working fluids into a electrical field in a tri-layer core-shell manner [59–62]. The other three parts are similar as the single-fluid process, i.e. a power supply that provides applied high voltage, a collector for the deposition of resultant nanofibers, and three pumps for quantitatively driving the three working fluids (Fig. 2).\nUsing triaxial electrospinning for the generation of tri-layer coreshell nanofibers is a common knowledge. However, when the outer fluid is a pure organic solvent for lubricating a continuous and robust preparation, the final products are double-layer core-shell nanofibers, and the working process can be termed as a modified triaxial electrospinning process [63,64]. In the present study, a modified triaxial\nelectrospinning method is exploited for the preparation of core-shell structure-based nanodrug depots, and unspinnable solvent mixture and drug solution are used as the outer and inner layer working fluids, respectively (Fig. 1). When the inner fluid is pure drug solution, the resulting drug nano depots are crystal-based depots D1. When the inner solution is a co-dissolved solution containing a drug and a polymer as a crystal growth inhibitor, the resulting drug nano depots are compositebased depots D2.\nA digital picture telling the arrangement of the triaxial electrospinning system is shown in Fig. 3a. The tri-layer concentric spinneret has a slight weight of 2.5 g, which can be directly fixed on a syringe loaded with the outer fluid, the transparent solvent mixture. The middle and inner fluids can be sent to the spinneret through highly elastic silicon tubes. As a convergent point of three fluids and electrical energy, the spinneret's nozzle is very important. Its design should meet the requirements of easy and effective interactions between working fluids, particularly the outer layer working fluid and the electrical fields. In the present study, the homemade tri-layer spinneret consisted of three metal capillaries, whose sizes are 13G (2.40 and 2.02 mm for outer and inner diameter, respectively), 16G (1.60 and 1.32 mm for outer and inner diameter, respectively), and 27G (0.41 and 0.20 mm for outer and inner diameter, respectively) for the outer, middle, and inner capillaries, respectively. The front view of the tri-layer concentric spinneret is exhibited in Fig. 3b. These capillaries have a common axial to lead the three working fluids into the electrical field in a tri-layer manner for subsequent drawing and drying processes. Meanwhile, the inner capillary projects slightly out the middle capillary 0.2 mm, and which successively projects out the outer capillary 0.2 mm. This arrangement should enhance encapsulation and prevent the possible diffusion between fluids at different layers. A side view of the spinneret is shown in Fig. 3c.\nFig. 3d shows how electrical energy is conveyed to the working fluids. A high power supply can be connected to a metal spinneret simply through an alligator clip. When the three fluids were pumped to the exit of the spinneret's nozzle for the preparation of the nano crystalbased drug depot D1, the applied voltage was gradually elevated to 17 kV and initiated the electrospinning process. A digital picture of the working process is shown in Fig. 3e. The typical three steps of a singlefluid electrospinning can be exhibited in triaxial electrospinning, that is, a Taylor cone, a straight fluid jet and an unstable bending and whipping region. Given that the outer diameter of the outer layer capillary is 2.40 mm, the length of the straight fluid jet can be estimated. Under optimized conditions, the length was about 3.3 cm. The digital picture of a typical tri-layer coaxial Taylor cone is shown in Fig. 3f, in which a blue core fluid (a methylene blue concentration of 2 × 10−3 mg/mL in the inner fluid was set only for the operational condition optimization experiments) was concentrically surrounded by a red fluid (a basic fuchsin concentration of 10−3 mg/mL in the middle fluid was set only for the operational condition optimization experiments), and successively surrounded by the outer transparent solvent mixture.\nWhen the inner fluid was loaded by a co-dissolving solution of PVP and TAM instead of the pure TAM solution, the triaxial process was implemented for generating the nano composite-based drug depot D2, whose typical process is shown in Fig. 3g. Similarly, a Taylor cone, straight fluid jet, and a bending and whipping unstable region with gradually enlarged loops can be captured using a digital camera under a magnification of ×12. The length of straight fluid jet was estimated to have a value of 4.5 cm, longer than that of preparing depots D1. Although the PVP–TAM inner solution had no electrospinnability due to the low polymer concentration and small molecular weight of PVP K30, the addition of PVP K30 in the inner fluid could exert some influence on the working process. Correspondingly, the compound Taylor cone for creating nano depot D2 had a larger height than that for producing depot D1 and shows a similar transparent–red–blue tri-layer concentric image in Fig. 3h.\nacetone and DMAc (1:4:1, v:v:v)."

      "text" : "In the traditional single-fluid electrospinning process, the working fluids must be spinnable for generating linear nanofibers, regardless of a pure polymer solution or a co-dissolving solution of a certain polymer with other additives. The multifluid electrospinning processes have expanded the capability of electrospinning in generating nanofibers in\ntwo ways. One is the capability of creating complicated nanostructures such as core–shell, Janus, and their combinations [65–68]. The other is the capability of treating fluids and materials lacking filament-forming properties into nanofibers, which are often accompanied by an electrospinnable fluid [62,69]. In the present study, the middle fluid of CA solution had fine electrospinnability. Its concentration was slightly increased to 12% for ensuring its capability of bearing two unspinnable\nfluids during the modified triaxial electrospinning processes. Under the operational conditions, the nano crystal-based drug depots D1 and nano composite-based drug depots D2 have linear morphology without the abnormal beads-on-a-string or spindles-on-a-string phenomenon (Fig. 4a and b, respectively). The depots D1 have an estimated diameter of 540 ± 80 nm, which is smaller than that of depots D2 (640 ± 110 nm). This is because the additive PVP in the core of depots D2 may have played a role in enlarging their diameters.\nAlthough their surface linear morphology is similar with smooth surfaces, the drug depots D1 and D2 have completely different crosssectional SEM images. In the center of the nano crystal-based depots D1, many small solid nanoparticles can be observed (Fig. 4c). These nanoparticles should be nano crystals of TAM. After being solidified with the shell CA layer, the drug molecules encapsulated in the core sections would inevitably re-crystallize into nano crystals in the confined region. In sharp contrast, no small particles are separated from the core matrices of nano composite-based drug depots D2, as indicated by the typical cross-sectional images in Fig. 4d. The projected core section suggested that the core PVP–TAM nano composites had a different mechanical performance with the shell CA layer. Meanwhile, the core–shell nanostructures of nano crystal-based drug depots D1 and nano composite-based drug depots D2 can be demonstrated by TEM, and the results are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively."

      "text" : "TAM is a poorly water-soluble drug. The raw TAM powders are present in a crystalline state, as indicated by the series of sharp peaks in\nthe XRD pattern in Fig. 6. Under the polarized optical microscope, the TAM particles are colorful with red, orange, green, cyan, and blue colors, concurring the crystalline state of raw TAM powders. By contrast, the raw CA and PVP powders have no sharp peaks in their XRD patterns, except some diffraction halos. The images of CA and PVP raw particles under polarized optical microscope have a gray color and are transparent, respectively. These phenomena demonstrated that raw CA and PVP particles are in an amorphous state.\nThe XRD pattern of nano crystal-based drug depots D1 in Fig. 6 suggested that crystalline TAM particles are present within the core sections, as indicated by the appearance of some sharp peaks found in the pattern of TAM raw particles. The original shape of TAM powders is mainly prismatic, as shown in the polarized optical microscopic image. However, the re-crystallized particles of TAM were round in the crosssectional SEM images in Fig. 4c. The working process and the confined region of the CA shell exerted remarkable influences on the re-crystallization processes of TAM, which will be further investigated. By contrast, the XRD pattern of nano composite-based drug depots D2 had no sharp peaks of TAM, and was very similar to the pattern of raw PVP particles. The similarity should be attributed to that the incorporation of TAM molecules had few influences on the amorphous state of PVP molecules, and the amorphous CA shell sections had a very small responsive intensity to the incident X-ray. Although a few TAM nano crystals might be present due to a high drug loading of 66.7% in the cores of depots D2, which could not be detected by XRD (having a lower detection limitation of 2% [52]), almost all of the TAM molecules were presumed to be in an amorphous state.\nCA and PVP are the most widely used polymeric excipients to\ndevelop solid dosage forms in the pharmaceutical industry. Their molecular formulas and the drug TAM are shown in Fig. 7. As shown in the figure, secondary interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions can occur between them. In the spectra of nano crystalbased drug depots D1, where there are only two components (i.e., the guest TAM and the host CA), the characteristic peaks of TAM and CA appear. For example, the shoulder peak at 1728 cm−1 and the peaks at 1232 and 1407 cm−1 are all from CA molecules; by contrast, the peaks at 1738 and 708 cm−1 are from TAM molecules. These phenomena verified that CA and TAM co-existed in the depots D1 in a hybrid manner, only as a physical mixture, providing a hint that TAM crystals were encapsulated by the CA shell layer.\nIn the spectra of nano composite-based drug depots D2, where there are three components (i.e., the guest TAM, the additive PVP K30, and the host filament-forming polymeric CA), the characteristic peaks of PVP and CA appear: the peaks at 1728, 1232, and 1407 cm−1 for CA and 1058 cm−1 for PVP. These phenomena demonstrated that CA and PVP presented in a hybrid manner in depots D2; that is, the core PVP is surrounded by the CA shell layer. However, the characteristic peaks of TAM such as 1738 and 708 cm−1 disappeared from the spectra. The reasons should be attributed to the formation of composites between TAM and PVP in the core section. The TAM molecules can act as proton donors from their hydroxyl groups (-OH) to form hydrogen bonds with\nthe PVP molecules, which have carbonxyl groups (-C=O) to act as proton acceptors. The red shift of –C=O vibrations from 1662 cm−1 in PVP's spectra to 1658 cm−1 in depots D2's spectra should provide a hint that TAM-PVP composites at the molecular level were formed during the triaxial electrospinning process. The highly homogeneous mixing state of TAM and PVP in the inner working fluids was propagated into the solid core–shell depots D2 due to the extremely fast solidification processes of electrospinning. Moreover, because TAM and PVP are highly compatible, they were able to co-exist in the core section to comprise the nano composite-based drug depots."

      "heading" : "3.4. Functional performance for providing drug sustained release profiles",
      "text" : "The in vitro dissolution test results of the two kinds of nano drug depots are shown in Fig. 8. Their drug sustained release profiles at a full time period of 96 h are exhibited in Fig. 8a. Depots D1 and D2 were able to provide a near zero-order release profile. There are three important parameters to evaluate the sustained release profiles: the initial burst release, the middle sustained release, and the tailing off release. The comparisons of these three parameters are shown in Fig. 8b, c, and d, respectively.\nFor homogeneous medicated nanofibers providing drug sustained release profiles, a big concern is the inevitable initial burst release due\nto the drug's abundant surface and short diffusion distance for the drug molecules dissolving into the dissolution media from the solid nanofibers. Here, because the shell sections of CA were blank, no any initial burst releases were observed. As shown in Fig. 8b, the release contents from depots D1 (4.3% ± 3.2%) and D2 (3.6% ± 2.5%) in the first hour were<5%, far from the standard level of 30% of loading drugs. To analyze the drug release data (i.e., the accumulative amount of TAM Q to the release time t) before the first 60 h according to the zero-order\nkinetics, the equations for depots D1 and D2 are Q1 = 10.34 + 1.65 t (R = 0.9793) and Q2 = 7.08 + 1.49 t (R = 0.9931), respectively, suggesting that both depots are able to provide a fine sustained release profile over a long time period. Although the two depots showed no significant differences between the two parameters, they exhibited significant differences in the tailing off release performances. Different from the initial burst release that may result in a toxic blood drug concentration, the tailing off release drug often results in a lower blood\ndrug concentration that has no therapeutic effect. Thus, the smaller the tailing off release, the better the whole sustained release profile. As shown in Fig. 8d, the nano composite-based depots D2 released 97.8% ± 4.4% of the loaded drug after 60 h dissolution tests and required approximately 12 h to exhaust the whole drug. By contrast, the nano crystal-based depots D1 released 90.7% ± 4.2% of the loaded drug after 60 h dissolution tests and required approximately 36 h to exhaust all the loaded drug. Regardless of the tailing off release time period or the tailing off release amount, the nano composite depots D2 always showed a better performance that the nano crystal-based depots D1."

      "heading" : "3.5. Proposed drug sustained release mechanisms for different nano depots",
      "text" : "A diagram showing the drug release mechanisms for both nano drug depots is exhibited in Fig. 9. From the above-mentioned characterizations, both nano drug depots have similar core–shell nanostructures and the same CA layer but different physical state of drug in the core section. In depots D1, the TAM molecules were re-crystallized into nano crystals. Conversely, in depots D2, the TAM molecules formed molecular composites with PVP molecules, which retards the formation of drug nuclei and crystal growth.\nThe TAM molecules loaded in the depots must pass three steps to go into the dissolution media from the solid nanofibers. The first step is the diffusion of water molecules into the inner section of depots from the bulk dissolution media. The shell section is full of entangled CA molecules with many inter-molecular voids, and the water molecules may penetrate into the core reservoir through these voids. The second step is the dissolution of TAM molecules into the penetrated water. In the third step, the dissolved TAM molecules inversely diffuse into the dissolution media from the solid depots. Because the shell layers are similarly composed of CA and their thicknesses are approximately the same for depots D1 and D2, the diffusion routes of both water and dissolved TAM molecules are similar. Thus, the dominant step during the in vitro dissolution process from the depots to the bulk dissolution media is the second step, that is, the dissolution of TAM molecules in the penetrated water in the drug reservoirs of depots.\nFor depots D1, the core reservoir was composed of TAM nano\ncrystals, whose dissolution must overcome the lattice energy. In particular, TAM is a poorly water-soluble drug. Thus, the formation of a saturated TAM solution in the core section of depots D1 needs a relatively longer time period. For depots D2, the core reservoir was composed of TAM nano composites with PVP, whose dissolution is easy and immediate if there are enough penetrated water molecules. Furthermore, PVP is a hydrophilic polymer and is reported to enhance the dissolution of over 100 water-insoluble active ingredients. This means that the TAM concentration in the saturated drug solution within the core sections of depots D2 should be higher than that at depots D1 besides the ease of formation. Thus, under a larger drug concentration difference between the inner core TAM saturated solution and the outer bulk dissolution media, the diffusion rate of TAM loaded in the nano composite-based depots D2 should be faster and more complete than those in the nano crystal-based depots D1, which in turn result in rapid exhaustion with less tailing off release time and tailing off release TAM amount."

      "text" : "A new type of drug nano depot was designed and fabricated using a modified triaxial electrospinning process, which was characterized by a core composite drug reservoir consisting of 66.7 wt% drug and 33.3 wt % PVP k30. The middle electrospinnable CA solution acted as a support, and the outer solvent mixture acted as a “lubricant” for encapsulating the inner drug reservoir, which facilitated the preparation of nano crystal-based drug depots D1 and nano composite-based drug depot D2. Both depots had linear morphology and clear core–shell nanostructures, as demonstrated by SEM and TEM observations. However, the drugs present in them showed different physical states, as verified by the XRD and FTIR data. In vitro dissolution tests demonstrated that the nano composite-based drug depots D2 showed a better sustained release profile than the nano crystal-based drug depots D1 in terms of a less late tailing off release amount and a shorter time period. The proposed mechanism suggested that the composite core drug reservoirs in depots D2 was beneficial for the formation of an inner saturated drug solution, which promoted and accelerated the complete diffusion of drug molecules, compared with the crystal drug core reservoirs in depots D1. The\nclear process–structure–performance relationship disclosed here should pave a new way for developing novel structural functional nanomaterials, particularly for the sustained release of active ingredients in various fields such as drug delivery, cosmetics, agriculture, food engineering, and functional textiles.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nKe Wang:Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Writing - original draft.Pu Wang:Data curation, Investigation, Resources, Writing - original draft.Menglong Wang:Data curation, Investigation.Deng-Guang Yu:Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review & editing.Fuxian Wan:Writing - review & editing.S.W.

Nano drug depots, characterized by core-shell structures with core drug reservoirs, are drawing increasing attention because of its potential applications in furnishing drug-sustained release profiles. In the present study, two kinds of nano drug depots, one containing a crystal drug reservoir and the other having a medicated composite drug reservoir, were prepared through modified triaxial electrospinning. Their drug-sustained release performances were compared in terms of initial burst release, middle linear release, and the late tailing off release. Although both depots had a linear morphology, clear core-shell nanostructures and the same cellulose acetate shell layer, they provided considerably different tailing off release performances, and thus different sustained release profiles. The composite-based drug depots showed a smaller tailing off drug amount of 2.2%, a shorter time period of 12 h, and a better zero-order controlled release kinetics in general than the crystal-based drug depots, whose tailing off amount was 9.3% over a time period of 36 h. The mechanism was proposed, which had a close relationship with the state of drug in the core reservoir. The present protocols open a new way for producing medicated structural nanomaterials.",
