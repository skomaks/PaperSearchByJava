      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "With the acceleration of globalization, the rapid development of economy have been promoted by the science and technology, as well knows that the rapid development of economy benefit mankind and inevitably causing serious damage to the environment, especially the water resources have been serious pollution (Chong et al., 2010; Legrini et al., 1993). Water is the source of life, if water resources can't be sustained, economic and social development can't be sustained. What's more, the pollution of water resources has threatened the normal work of human beings and caused widespread concern (Cermakova et al., 2017). Usually, dyestuff wastewater, industrial heavy metal wastewater and industrial organic wastewater are responsible for water pollution. Among them, organic wastewater containing 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) has many serious problems (Hassan et al., 2017), such as long pollution time, large discharge, serious harm, high toxicity and extremely difficult treatment. However, the reductive product of 4- aminophenol (4-AP) is a relatively non-toxic product. As an important fine chemical intermediate, 4-AP is widely used in paracetamol, contrast agent, indicator and dye (Wang et al., 2017;\ne by Eddy Y. Zeng.\nZelekew and Kuo, 2017). Therefore, the realization of green energy conversion is an effectivemeans to solve environmental and energy problems.\nUp to now, many technologies have been developed for the removal of 4-NP, such as biodegradation, adsorption (Tomei et al., 2003; Ahmaruzzaman and Gayatri, 2010; Dhorabe et al., 2016), photo-degradation (Barreca et al., 2014), Fenton progress (Chen et al., 2017a,b), electro-catalysis (Kokkinidis and Papanastasiou, 1989) and hydrogenation catalyst (Li et al., 2014; Revathy et al., 2018) etc. However, most methods are not able to effectively remove 4-NP, but only collect toxic substances, and further calcination treatment, such as adsorption. Compared with other methods, catalytic hydrogenation is a green, most efficient and potential method to achieve conversion from 4-NP to 4-AP. However, the reaction rate of 4-NP reduction is very tardiness without catalyst participation. It is well known that it is a desirable and necessary measure to select suitable catalyst to accelerate the reaction rate in industrial production. Therefore, in recent decades, in order to achieve high-efficient 4-NP reduction, researchers have done a lot of work on efficient catalysts.\nCompared with non-nano-catalysts, nano-catalysts have attracted wide attention because nano-catalysts have the advantages of larger specific surface area, higher reaction efficiency, easier surface modification and easy composite with other materials (Rocha et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017). At present, noble metal\nnano-catalysts, such as palladium, gold, platinum and silver, are the hot spots in the study of 4-NP catalytic reduction (Zhang et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016). As well all know, the d-electron orbitals of precious metal are not completely full, and the surface is easy to adsorb reactants, which is conducive to the formation of intermediates. Noble metal catalyst have high catalytic activity, and also has excellent comprehensive properties such as high temperature resistance, oxidation resistance, corrosion resistance and so on. However, high cost, fast deactivation, difficult to reuse, scarce resources and other shortcomings are the key factors restricting its wide application. In addition, they have other deficiencies, including difficulties in mass production and industrial applications. In nature, transition metal elements are abundant and cheap, which provides an opportunity for the production of cheap catalysts. The transition metal catalyst has the characteristics of good thermal stability, strong anti-toxicity, long service life and high selective oxidation. It also has many oxygen vacancies, which provides more catalytic activation sites for catalytic reaction (Yoo et al., 2014). The magnetic catalyst can also be recovered and reused by a simple magnetic cycling method (Li et al., 2016). Because of these characteristics, a large number of transition metal catalysts and their oxides, such as Ni@NiO, CuO, NiO/NiS, CoO and CoFe2O4, were synthesized and used in 4-NP catalytic reaction (Zelekew and Kuo, 2017; Chen et al., 2017b. Ozay, 2013; Wei et al., 2015). Base on the properties of magnetism, it can greatly overcome the problem of recycling and reuse of catalyst. Among them, bimetallic nanocrystals have attracted much attention because of their synergistic effect, adjustable composition and higher catalytic activity than single metal catalysts. Although nano-catalyst has many advantages, it is easy to be lost in the reaction process because of its small size. In order to prevent the loss of catalyst, it is usually combined with the carrier. Carbon carriers have the ability to transport electrons at high speed, which may accelerate the electron transfer between isolated metal particles. Generally, the materials used to prepare carbon carriers are polymers, graphene oxide (GO), graphene, sugars and sodium oleate (Yao et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014; Krishna et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016). However, most of these carbon sources are expensive, which is not a small obstacle to their industrial application. Therefore, it is necessary to find a cheap carbon source and a simple and effective synthesis method to obtain carbon carrier supported nano-catalysts.\nHumic acid, as a cheap carbon source fromweathered coal with low combustion energies, can be used as carbon carrier for cheap preparation and efficient catalytic application. In this paper, we synthesized a kind of CoFe2O4/C nano-sheets (NSs) with high catalytic activity for 4-NP by using potassium fulvate as carbon source and sodium chloride (NaCl) as salt medium. The synthesized catalyst has excellent catalytic reduction performance and good cycle stability for 4-NP. In this paper, a method of producing highly efficient supported catalysts with cheap carbon source is presented, which is of great significance for 4-NP reduction and other industrial catalytic applications."

      "text" : "Chemicals. NaCl, ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3$6H2O), potassium hydroxide (KOH), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), 4-NP and cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2$6H2O) were analytical grade and used without further purification. Potassium fulvate is a commercial product from Xinjiang Shuanglong humic acid Co. Ltd. Hydrochloric acid (36%) and hydrofluoric acid (40%) are combined for the purification of potassium fulvate.\nPurification of potassium fulvate. As for the purification technology of potassium fulvate, we refer to the method of Zhou Shungui (Zhou et al., 2015), and make some improvements. Certain\namounts of potassium fulvate are completely dissolved in the deionized water, and centrifuge for 10min at about 12000 rpm to separate the insoluble solids. Then the pH value of potassium fulvate solution was adjusted to 1 by hydrochloric acid. A large amount of fulvic acid precipitation is produced during acidification. The precipitated fulvic acid is washed by a series of cleaning processes, the order of which is mixed acid (5M HCl-5% HF), 1.8M hydrochloric acid and distilled water. Finally, the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 10.5 with 6M KOH solution, and the solution was evaporated to obtain the purified potassium fulvate solid.\nPreparation of CoFe2O4/C NSs. The primary preparation process of CoFe2O4/C is as follow: In the case of magnetic stirring, add 1.5 g of potassium fulvate and 25 mL of deionized water to 100mL of glass beaker to make it completely dissolved. 20mmol of ferric chloride hexahydrate and 10mmol cobaltchloride hexahydrate are dissolved in a 50mL of beaker with 15mL of deionizedwater. When the two solutions are mixed, a complex reaction occurs and a large amount of sediment is produced. After stirring at 70 C for 12 h, the water is removed by evaporation, and then the precursor is obtained by freeze-drying. 20 g of NaCl powder was ground into fine powder, and then 1 g of the precursor was added, and continued grinding until uniform. The grinded solids were calcined at a heating rate of 5 C min 1 and argon atmosphere for 4 h at a specified temperature to obtain different products (500 C(CoFe2O4/C-500 or S1-500), 600 C(CoFe2O4/C-600 or S1600), 700 C(CoFe2O4/C-700 or S1-700)). In an inert atmosphere, the calcined product is cooled to room temperature. CoFe2O4/C nanocomposites can be obtained by repeated washing with distilled water and freeze-drying.\nCharacterization. The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were recorded by the X-ray diffractometer (model Rigaku D/max-gA, Japan) using Cu Ka radiation (lD¼ 0.15418 nm). The samples were scanned in the 2q range from 10 to 80 at a scanning rate of 10 min 1. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer using Al Ka (1486.8 eV) as the X-ray source. The sheet structure of as-prepared sample was observed by using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a Hitachi H-600 (Japan) with and an accelerating voltage of 75 kV CoFe2O4/C NSs were also further ascertained by using laser Raman. CoFe2O4/C NSs spectra were obtained by using a portable DeltaNu (LabRam HR Evolution) battery powered Raman spectrometer (laser excitation wavelength lex¼ 514 nm)。\nCatalytic performance of CoFe2O4/C nanocomposites. The catalytic activity of CoFe2O4/C nanocomposites was explored by monitoring the reduction reaction of 4-NP. First, 2.95mL of 4-NP (0.1mM) was added into the cuvette, and then the 9.5mg of NaBH4 powder was added directly into the above solution. There is a maximum absorption peak at 400 nm. Second, the 50 mL of catalyst (1mgmL 1) was dripped into the quartz box through a pipette, and the reaction time was recorded quickly. With the increase of reaction time, the concentration of 4-NP decreased gradually. Record each absorption curve and corresponding reaction time to make the corresponding data accurate and reasonable. The specific process of the loop testing will be mentioned later, and we won't describe it here."

      "text" : "Regarding the results of FTIR spectra characterization of humic acid, our group (Wang et al., 2018) reported the FTIR spectra data of humic acid earlier. The peaks at 3695 cm 1, 3400 cm 1, 1870 cm 1\nand 1375 cm 1 are related to the NeH bond, OH stretch of OH groups and carbonyl vibration of carboxyl and ketone groups respectively (Martha et al., 2004). The humic acid has an aromatic ring structure, and the carbon-carbon conjugated double bond and the carbon-carbon single bond in the fragrant structure are detected, and the corresponding vibration peaks are C]C at 1578 cm 1 and CeC at 1102 cm 1, respectively (Kalbitz et al., 1999). The results show that humic acid has many organic groups and can form complex with many metal ions.\nThis mixture that CoFe2O4/C precursor was calcined with the heating rate of 5 C min 1, and under inert gas (argon) atmosphere. The decomposition state can be studied by thermogravimetric analysis. The TGA and DTG curves obtained from the precursor heat treatment temperature from room temperature to 800 C are shown in Fig. 1. When the calcination temperature is less than 115 C, the first loss (~8.81%) is usually attributed to the elimination of adsorbed water in the precursor. The second loss (~8.86%) is about 115 Ce185 C, which is usually attributed to the decomposition of crystalline water or intramolecular water. Then, when the calcination temperature exceeds 185 C, the carbonization and decomposition of fulvic acid occur in the range of 185 Ce465 C, as shown in Equation (4).\npotassium fulvate þ H2O /fulvic acid þ OH (1)\nCo2þ þ H2O / Co(OH)2 þ Hþ (2)\nFe3þ þ H2O / Fe(OH)3 þ Hþ (3)\nFulvic acid / C þ CO þ CO2 þ H2O (4)\nCo(OH)2 þ 2Fe(OH)3/ CoFe2O4 þ 2H2O (5)\nCombined with XRD analysis, Co(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3 were decomposed and CoFe2O4 was formed at calcination temperature of 500 C with the decomposition of fulvic acid. Therefore, it is concluded that the decomposition of Co(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3 also contributes to the weight loss peak between 185 C and 465 C, as shown in Equation (5). Previous studies (Wang et al., 2008a) have shown that one-dimensional cobalt ferrite nanostructures can be prepared by sol-gel method, and the formation temperature of CoFe2O4 was 268 C according thermogravimetric analysis. When the calcination temperature is higher than 465 C, the potassium\nfulvate begins to decompose in a large amount. As a result of calcination under inert conditions, potassium fulvate is finally decomposed and carbonized, resulting in the formation of carbon film carriers."

      "text" : "As shown in Fig. 2, the prepared material is confirmed to be CoFe2O4 by XRD. The peaks of products can be clearly observed at 2q¼ 30.08 , 35.43 , 37.06 , 43.06 , 53.41 , 56.94 , 62.53 and 74.97 , respectively. XRD results show that the crystal faces corresponding to different peaks are (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511) and (440) planes with fcc crystal structure. The diffraction peaks and relative intensities of all patterns match well with standard JCPDS card No. 22-1086, which is consistent with the results reported in the literature (Ayyappan et al., 2009). The results show that cobalt ferrite can be synthesized by high temperature calcination. There is no obvious carbon peak in the XRD spectra of the sample obtained at 500 C, because the carbon obtained at this temperature belongs to amorphous carbon. The XRD patterns of the samples at 600 C and 700 C show two obvious diffraction peaks at about 25 and 43 , which are the characteristic diffraction peaks of carbonmaterials (Deng et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017). The results show that the organic precursors calcined in molten salts can form carbon materials at 600 C and 700 C. Moreover, it can be seen that with the increase of temperature, the degree of graphitization increases, and the intensity of the corresponding diffraction peak will be significantly enhanced.\nFurther, the morphology of CoFe2O4/C composite was examined by TEM, as shown in Fig. 3. The lattice fringes of different materials are shown in Fig. 3(gei). High magnification TEM display that the lattice fringes and veins of CoFe2O4/C composites are very clear. Therefore, it can be judged that the crystal face of the material is exposed to the surface of the carbon support. As the calcination temperature increases, the thickness of the carbon support gradually becomes thinner, which is consistent with our previous results. Fig. 3 (b) and (c) show that the carbon carrier has a large number of wrinkles, and it can be seen that the carbon film is very thin. At the same time, the results of HR-TEM show that CoFe2O4 is uniformly loaded on the carbon film carrier (Carta et al., 2007). The TEM mapping of CoFe2O4/C-600 nanocomposite in Fig. S3(a-e) shows that Co, Fe and O element do indeed form cobalt ferrite. The diffraction ring of cobalt ferrite can be clearly observed from the corresponding electron diffraction pattern (Bakhshi et al., 2015).\nSodium chloride sacrifice template in the formation of nanomaterials protection, can prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles. Combined with thermogravimetric analysis, although fulvic acid was decomposed before 500 C, but, a lot of decomposition is after 550 C. Therefore, the optimum calcination temperature for the composite should be greater than 550 C.\nFurther evaluation of the carbon support in the composite was carried out. The graphite sheets in CoFe2O4/C NSs were also further ascertained by using laser Raman. The defect state (D) peak and graphitized (D) peak of carbon materials at 1340 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 were observed clearly, respectively. The G peak is usually regarded as the E2g phonon of C sp2 atoms. The D peaks is a disordered oscillation of absorption peak of the carbon atoms, which is caused by the defect of the carbon bond and is also mention in the Guoxiu Wang report (Wang et al., 2008b). The Raman results show that the degree of graphitization of carbon in the material is low, as the calcination temperature increases, the D peak and the G peak tend to decrease.\nThe surface element composition of the CoFe2O4/C composite material could be further investigated by XPS in Fig. 4. The element\nof Co, Fe, O, C, in the CoFe2O4/C composite material were presented. These are characteristic of high spin Fe3þ and Co2þ centres. The peaks of the Co2p spectrum correspond to Co2p1 and Co2p3 at 802.38 eV and 781.28 eV were indexed, respectively. Above results indicate that the Co is divalent (Co2þ). The characteristic peaks of Fe3p1 was detected at 711.85 eV and 725.53 eV, which was consistent with the Fe3þ doubling peak in the literature (Ballarini et al., 2009). The C1s and O1s spectrum indicate that the correspond peaks of carbon, the peaks at 288.78 eV is carbon-oxygen double bond (C]O), CeOeC (at 286.68 eV), CeC (at 284.78 eV) and O]CeO (at 290.48 eV)."

      "heading" : "3.3. Catalytic reaction of 4-NP to 4-AP",
      "text" : "In the presence of sodium borohydride reductant, the reduction of 4-NP is a six-electron direct transfer process. To date, aqueous reduction reactions from 4-Np to 4-AP, a generally accepted reaction process, have been tested and verified by many different laboratories (Aditya et al., 2015). The reaction is shown in Eq. (6).\nReNO2 þ 4Hþ þ 6e / ReNH2 þ 2OH (6)\nFor the reaction of 4-NP to 4-AP, their standard electrode potentials can be calculated according to Yan. Z reported (Yan et al., 2018), which is higher than zero (DE0¼ E0(4-NP/4-AP) - E0(H3BO3/BH4 )¼-0.76 - (- 1.33)¼ 0.67 V). The reaction is spontaneous in kinetics, but due to the restriction of thermodynamics, the reaction speed is slow, so the catalyst is essential for this reduction reaction. At ambient temperature, the detection of the reduction process of 4-NP could be implemented by the UVevis 2550 Ultraviolet Spectrometer. The absorption peak of p-nitrophenol was redshifted with the addition of sodium borohydride, and the absorption peak was changed from 317 nm to 400 nm. When the catalyst is added, the adsorption peak at 400 nm is rapidly reduced, and another adsorption peak at 300 nm began to appear and increase. The latter peak appeared was confirmed as the absorption of 4-AP.\nThe results show that the catalysts (CoFe2O4/C-500, 600 and 700) have good catalytic activity for 4-NP reduction. The order of catalytic activity decreases as follow: CoFe2O4/C-600> CoFe2O4/C700> CoFe2O4/C-500. Fig. 5 (C) shows that CoFe2O4/C-600 catalyst can completely catalyze the reduction of 4-NP in 3min under the conditions of 25 C, [4-NP]¼ 0.1mM, n[4-NP]/n[NaBH4]¼ 1/835. The apparent rate constant kapp has a maximum value of 1.91 min 1 compared with other constants. The rate constant increase as the reaction time decreases. At 500 C calcination, the catalyst support is thicker and has a smaller specific surface area. The CoFe2O4/C500 catalysts have a slower catalytic rate due to fewer reaction sites on the catalyst surface. Although CoFe2O4/C-700 catalyst has the same specific surface area as CoFe2O4/C-600 catalyst, it can be seen from TEM of Fig. 3(c) that the catalyst was partially agglomerated when calcined at 700 C. The BET analysis in Fig. S6, the isotherm is type II isotherm with hysteresis loops. S-type isotherms occur on non-porous solid surfaces or macroporous solids, it usually occurs in a single-layer and multi-layer reversible adsorption process.\nThere is an inflection point B at the low P/P0, which is the first steep portion of the isotherm, which indicates the saturated adsorption capacity of the monolayer, the inflection point B is the completion of the monolayer adsorption. As the relative pressure increases, the number of adsorbed layers increases, and the number of adsorbed layers is infinite at saturated vapor pressure (Gu and Zhu, 1990.). Therefore, the catalyst performance of CoFe2O4/C-600 catalyst and CoFe2O4/C-700 catalyst are much higher than CoFe2O4/C-500 catalyst. From the BET analysis, the specific surface area of the catalyst obtained at 600 C is slightlymore than 700 C. This may be the reason for the slight decrease in catalyst activity. The amount of catalyst and rate constant are listed in Table S2, and K/m is the ratio of catalyst dosage to apparent reaction rate constant. The rate constant kapp can be calculated through kinetic equation, which can be written as follow:\ndCt=dt ¼ kapp$Ct; ln Ct=C0 or ln At=A0 ¼ kt (7) In this reduction reaction, the amount of sodium borohydride is much more than 4-NP due to the excessive use of sodium borohydride. So, most experts believe that the conversion from 4-NP to 4-AP is in accordance with the pseudo-first-order kinetic equation, which has also been confirmed. A comparison of the catalytic performance of the CoFe2O4/C-600 NSs and other catalyst is given in Table 1, the results show that the CoFe2O4/C-600 NSs has the highest catalytic rate constant. The combination of transition metals and carbon materials is responsible for the superior performance of the catalyst. The carbon carrier have large specific surface area to provide more attachment sites for the catalyst, so the composite catalyst can expose more effective catalytically active sites during the catalytic process to accelerate the reaction rate.\nAccording to the above catalyst dosage conditions, the effect of the amount of sodium borohydride on the reaction rate was investigated by using CoFe2O4/C-600 catalyst. The reaction rate\ndecreases as the amount of reducing agent decreases in Fig. 6. As the amount of NaBH4 is 0.25mmol, the rate constant is 1.91 min 1. When the amount of NaBH4 is reduced by a factor of four to 0.06mmol, the CoFe2O4/C catalyst still has a very high reaction rate constant of 0.71 min 1. Compared with other catalysts, the nanocomposite materials synthesized by this method can greatly save the amount of sodium borohydride, thus reducing the production cost. The amount of sodium borohydride and rate constant are\nFig. 7. Activity test of CoFe2O4/C-600 catalyst. (a) The plots of Ct/C0 against reaction time, (b) respectively.

The morphology, crystallinity and composition of the materials were analyzed by TEM, XRD and XPS. The study on the catalytic performance of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) shows that CoFe2O4/C-600 nano-catalyst has the highest catalytic activity and the corresponding apparent constant is 1.91 min 1, this result is higher than that reported in most literatures. Catalytic kinetics of 4-NP reduction was studied in this article, and activation energy (Ea) was calculated to be 14.31 kJ mol 1. The catalyst also shows good cycle performance and stability. This convenient method provides a reference for the synthesis of MFe2O4/C and other nano-metal oxides/C nanocomposite catalysts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
