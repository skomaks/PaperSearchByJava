In-situ generation of micro and nano particles in the Mg-melt is supposed to have a better bonding with the matrix. Ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) is added to initial Magnesium melt (with an aim to generate CeO2 and MgO through in-situ reaction) at temperatures of 670 C and 870 C. The developed MMCs are solution treated to get rid of intermetallic. The nature of particles is explored with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS). The morphology and sizes of particles are keenly jotted using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Mechanical responses of developed MMCs are recorded through Hardness, Compression and scratch tests. The compression fractured surfaces are analyzed with SEM and scratched samples are analyzed on 3D optical profilometer to explore deformation behavior. The observations indicate the in-situ formation of CeO2, MgO and CeMg12 intermetallic phases in different types and sizes. Further, these particles are responsible for improved mechanical properties. The findings are supported by the contribution of different strengthening mechanisms."

      "text" : "Mg alloys and Mg based Metal matrix composites (MMCs) have vast application in automotive, aerospace and biomedical applications.1–6 MMCs have edge over alloys in high temperature applications, where intermetallic are unstable. Moreover, MMnCs (Metal matrix nano composites) can improve ductility as well.5,7 Mg based MMCs can find better place over Mg alloys for tribological application where temperature can surpass 150 C.8\nIn general, MMC can be produced using powder metallurgy or methods involving molten metal.4 Mgbio ceramic composites have been made by sintering.9 Stir casting is common route for preparing MMCs. MMCs can be produced ex-situ (addition of ceramics) or in-situ (production of ceramics). Further, Magnesium is highly reactive and tries to reduce reinforcements, thus impairing the properties of reinforcements.10 This aspect adds more complexity to the in-situ generation of ceramic particles. Magnesium does not form carbides easily; thus, carbides of other metals are stable in it.4 Magnesium reacts with alumina\nin the melt state to form MgO.4 Kujur et al.11 have shown the stability of ceria (Rare earth oxide) in the Magnesium matrix. Goh et al.12,13 synthesized MgMgO nanocomposite and Mg-yttria nano composite with the DMD technique. They found good interfacial adhesion between Mg matrix and MgO particles. The above discussion can be briefed as, Rare earth oxides, metal carbides and Magnesium oxide are stable in magnesium melt.\nThe common issues associated with developments of MMCs are poor wettability of reinforcement, non-uniform distribution, agglomeration of\n1Centre for Automotive Research and Tribology, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India 2Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, India\nCorresponding author: Deepak Kumar, Centre for Automotive Research and Tribology, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Delhi 110016, India.

They can be dealt with the in-situ ceramic generation.14 Li et al.15 developed metal matrix nanocomposite (MMnC) by dispersing SiC (30 nm) in Al-matrix by introducing ultrasonic vibration.Sudarshan et al.16,17 and Chelliah et al.18–20 have tried to produce in-situ nano-ceramic particles using polysilazane as a precursor in Magnesium melt. The formation of nanoparticles is related to the evolution of hydrogen. Hydrogen evolution during reaction disintegrate the particles to the nano level. Bhingole et al.21 introduced magnesium nitrate into AZ91 melt and reported the formation of nano-ceramic particles (MgO, Al2O3) along with microparticles as well. They also utilized the ultrasonication for further disintegration of particles. Recently, kumar and pandey22,23 tried to developed Mg alloy with Nb dopping. However, Nb remained unreacted with Mg during sintering process and formed Nb reinforced composite.\nCeO2 and MgO are suitable reinforcements for the Magnesium matrix owing to various properties.11,12 It has vast potential in biomedical and tribological applications, too.11,21,24,25 Mg embedded with CeO2 and MgO nanoparticles shows the increase in microhardness, dimensional stability, damping capacity, ignition resistance, compressive strengths and ductility.11,12,26 The present study is an attempt to explore the possibility for in-situ generation of CeO2 and MgO particles in Mg-matrix through the simple gravity stir casting process. Ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) is used as a precursor to fulfill the objective. The improvement in mechanical properties is noticed."

Samples were further polished with water-based alumina (3mm) slurry and ethanol-based alumina (250 nm) slurry consecutively. The polished samples are bath sonicated in ethanol media to get rid of loose debris. The polished samples were air-dried etched with an etchant (75ml ethanol, 25ml DI water, 1ml acetic acid and 1ml nitric acid) for 70 sec. The etched samples were analyzed under the microscope. Porosity analysis was done using optical and SEM micrographs.\nX-ray diffraction. Phases are recorded using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku (Ultima IV) machine using the Cu Ka radiation) for C91, CS91 and C92 samples. The scan was carried out at 2 degrees/min. Further analyses was done by indexing the different peaks. The corresponding phases were identified using PDF patterns retrieved by using reference number stored in the PDF database maintained by the International Center for Diffraction Data (ICDD).\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Zeiss EVO-MA 10) coupled with Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (BRUKER, QUANTAX 70) has been used to analyze the different samples.\nHardness measurement. Vickers hardness of different MMCs was estimated as per ASTM standard (E 92- 17). Indentation was carried on HMV-2 Shimadzu micro-hardness tester using Vickers diamond tip indenter at a normal load of 4.903N with a dwell time of 12 sec. Utmost caution was taken to avoid indentation at or near porosity. Fourty readings were taken for each MMC.\nCompression testing.

      "text" : "Reaction analysis. The hypothesis of the in-situ generation of different particles is presented here. Audebrand et al.27 showed, CAN starts decomposing to ceria, oxides of nitrogen, ammonia and oxygen at 110 C and completely decomposes to ceria at 190 C as illustrated in equations (1) and (2).\nDuring 110–150 C\nCe IVð Þ NH4ð Þ2 NO3ð Þ6 ! 1=3Ce IIIð Þ2 NH4ð Þ3 NO3ð Þ9 þ 1=3 CeO2 þ NH3;NO;NO2;O2ð Þ\n(1)\nDuring 155–190 C\n1=3Ce IIIð Þ2 NH4ð Þ3 NO3ð Þ9 ! 2=3 CeO2 þ NH3;NO;NO2;O2ð Þ (2)\nThe evolved O2, NO and NO2 tend to react with magnesium and form magnesia. Thus, nitrogen-based gasses are expected to be reduced. Further, the evolved ammonia and nitrogen-based oxides are expected to create localized explosions that are responsible for the generation and dispersion of nano-ceramic particles and other features. The similar argument is proposed by Chelliah et al.28 as well. They proposed; the evolution of hydrogen gas creates high localized pressure which fragments microparticles into nanoparticles. Ellingham diagram shows a more favorable condition for the formation of magnesia over ceria.29,30 Ceria is probably converting to magnesia. However, the presence of ceria in the magnesium matrix can be attributed to reaction kinetics and small difference in Gibbs free energy of magnesia and ceria.\nMicrostructural analysis. Optical micrographs of as-cast Mg, C91, CS91 and C92 MMCs are shown in Figure 1. Examination of microstructure through linear intercept method at 10 locations revealed average grain size for As cast Mg to be 230( 30) mm (Figure 1(a)), for C92 grain size is 140( 30) mm (Figure 1(b)), for C91 is 47( 18) mm (Figure 1(c)), and for CS91 is 180( 30) mm (Figure 1(d)),\nrespectively. The MMC cast at high temperature (C92) has a low density of particles. However, the particle density is much higher for the MMC cast at low temperature (C91). Comparing Figure 1(c) and (d), it can be commented that the in-situ developed particles do not dissolve during the solution treatment and no significant change in shape and size is observed.\nThe reduction in grain size is attributed to the heterogeneity of the system. The in-situ developed ceramic particles are responsible for reducing grain growth, even during the solution treatment. The reduced particle density for C92 may be attributed to the agglomeration and settlement of particles into the furnace itself because of low melt viscosity at high casting temperature.\nLarge amount of porosity is found due to entrapped gasses evolved during reactions. The MMC cast at a lower temperature (C91) has higher porosity ( 6–8%) while the porosity is reduced ( 0.3–1%) for MMC cast at a higher temperature (C92). The reduced porosity is attributed to higher entropy of evolved gasses at a higher temperature which helps in their easy escape out of the melt. Other explanation may be based on the fact that the decomposition rate of CAN is faster at a higher temperature. Which leads to the evolution of gasses before proper mixing into the Mg-melt.\nX-ray diffraction studies. Figure 2 shows the XRD spectra for different MMCs. It reveals the formation of Mg-Ce intermetallic, Ceria and Magnesia in C91. However, no peak of Mg-Ce intermetallic or Ceria have been found in C92. However, a small peak for Magnesia can be seen in the spectra. Further, XRD analysis of CS91 indicates the successful dissolution of intermetallic.\nThe presence of Mg-Ce intermetallic and particles can be understood with the help of the Ellingham diagram, which points to a higher probability for the formation of magnesia over ceria due to more favorable Gibbs free energy for magnesia.29,30 The presence of Mg-Ce intermetallic in C91 may be attributed to the reduction of some ceria by magnesium melt. Mg-Ce intermetallic is stable till 587 C.31 The absence of intermetallic in C92 casting is not clear until now. However, the absence of ceria in the C92 matrix is probably due to fast settling of ceria which has a higher density than magnesia.32,33 Probably settling of ceria is so fast that magnesium is unable to interact with ceria to form intermetallic. Moreover, the low intensity magnesia peak also indicates the scarcity of magnesia.\nKey observations from Figures 1 and 2 are: (i) The MMC cast at high temperature has the grain size is in the same order of magnitude as of bare Mg. However, it shows some reinforcement particles distributed in grain and along the grain boundary. (ii) The MMC cast at lower temperature has very high density of\nreinforcement and smaller grain size. (iii) These particles do not dissolve during solution treatment. (iv) The solution treatment of C91 results in increased grain size and a negligible effect on micro-particle\ndensity. (v) the intermetallic particles, present in C91, dissolved during solution treatment.\nSEM and EDS analyses. SEM micrographs and EDS mapping of C91 MMC revealed the presence of different types of particles in the composites (Figures 3 to 8). The different particles are termed as; (i) cerium based intermetallic, (ii) agglomerated nano-to-sub micron ceramics, (iii) cauliflower with web like structure, (iv) nanoparticles/nanowires, (v) continuous ceramic particles (CCP). Figure 3 reveals the presence of round cerium-based particles (1–3 mm). X-ray mapping shows a low amount of magnesium at the location of these particles (Figure 3(f)). This suggests the intermetallic nature of the particles. The other cerium-based particles are found on islands of magnesia, which are confirmed with their presence in Figures 3 and 4. These cerium based particles show no magnesium presence (Figure 4(f)), which confirms them to be of ceria. However, unlike magnesia particles, solution treatment of C91 results in the loosening/weakening of the ceriamatrix interface (Figure 4(f)). The loosening/weakening of ceria-matrix interface may be attributed to the\nwettability of ceria particles by matrix, which is controlled by the surface and interface energetics. Literature suggests that surface energy of ceria (1.12– 2.4 J/m2)34 is lower than magnesia (1.2–12.8 J/m2).35\nFurther, high-resolution exploration of magnesia islands suggests them as clusters of nano-to- submicron size particles (Figure 5). The other category of the particles that appeared in Mg-matrix is cauliflower like structures (Figure 6). To be further specific, these particles are found to remain in a nearly dome structure of 1–3 mm with a web of nano-wires extending 2–10mm around it. X-ray mapping reveals the dominance of oxygen at the center of the structure and weakening of concentration as the web of nano-wires fades (Figure 6). Further, the exploration of bulk (away from the nano-wire web) reveals the appearance of nano-size particles/nanowires (Figure 7). It is\nimportant to mention that the cauliflower structures and web of nano-wires remain protruded out of the matrix even after polishing. Figure 8 indicates the presence of one more type of particles. There are few islands of magnesia and few islands of ceria. These islands are flat with no sign of agglomeration, termed as continuous ceramic particles (CCP) (Figure 8). Further nature of these islands has been discussed later. SEM micrograph of C92 is shown in Figure 9(a) and (b). Detailed SEM analysis micrographs revealed a dominant presence of the Cauliflower structure in the MMC. There is the presence of ceramic particles of size 1–10 mm and nanoparticles as well. These ceramics particles seem to be leftovers of bulk agglomerates. The bulk agglomerates are expected to settle into the furnace at high temperature due to low melt viscosity.\nHowever, the webby nature of the cauliflower structure is probably providing more surface area. Therefore, the dominance of viscous forces over inertial forces has stabilized these structures in the melt. The hypotheses of in-situ ceria formation have been successfully justified above. However, the formation of cerium intermetallic and magnesia need to be understood. The forth given discussion elaborates further.\nEffect of in situ reinforcements on mechanical responses\nOn hardness. Figure 10 shows the variation in hardness for as-cast Mg and different MMCs. The MMC cast at a lower temperature (C91) shows a significant increase in hardness (almost double to that of Mg, 32Hv). Gravity die cast AZ91 ( 54 Hv) and AZ61 ( 58 Hv) have lesser hardness than C91 MMC.36 The level of hardness for high temperature cast MMC (C92) and solution treated MMC (CS91) is almost the same ( 45Hv) but higher than that of as-cast Mg. Along with the above mentioned results, in C91 there are\nsome areas (5-8%) where hardness varies between 80–380 Hv range. However, these values are not included for averaging (reported in Figure 10).\nThe increase in hardness is attributed to the presence of different particles in the Mg-matrix. Further, the decrease in hardness for solution treated MMC (CS91) is attributed to the dissolution of intermetallic and reduced Mg-particle interfacial strength (Figure 4 (f)). The lower value of hardness for C92 than C91 can be explained with a reduced number and type of in-situ developed particles (Figure 1).\nThe careful examination of indentation marks corresponding to high hardness values (80-380 Hv) helped\nin understanding the nature of ceramic islands. The SEM micrographs of such two indents are shown in Figures 8 and 11. Figure 8 shows an almost flat continuous ceramic particle (CCP) and corresponds to the hardness of 378 Hv. The appearance of cracks near the corner of the indentation mark implies the brittle nature of the particle. Figure 11 shows the indent on the rugged ceramic island. Here no crack near the edges of the indent is observed thus pointing to ductile or less brittle nature of the island. Moreover, the indentation confirmed these islands to be a cluster of nano, submicron and micron-size particles. The generation of CCP is conceptually not possible since the sintering temperature of ceramics is very high. The rare presence of CCP implies that at some locations local temperature has reached extremely high.\nOn scratching behaviour. Figure 12(a) to (d) show the 3-D optical micrographs for different MMCs. Deep and wide scratch with a high amount of pile up for ascast Mg indicate low hardness with ductile nature (Figure 12(a)). Whereas, contrasting scratching behavior (narrow and shallow scratch with a negligible pile\nup) for C91 MMC is noticed (Figure 12(c)). This indicates high hardness with reduced ductility. Based on scratch profile appearance, the order of ductility can be; as-cast Mg>C92>CS91>C91. Figure 13 shows 2-D scratch profiles of analytes at random locations along with traction forces during the scratch. This indicates that based on traction force, scratching resistance can be arranged as; as-cast Mg CS91>C92>C91. To get a further understanding of scratching behavior, wear volume and scratch hardness are estimated and mapped correspondingly (Figure 14). The wear volume and scratch hardness for C91 MMC is almost 1/6 and almost 2.5 times to that of as-cast Mg, respectively. Sinha et al.37 also showed similar result where they found decrease in wear volume and increase in scratch hardness for ceramic reinforced Mg. CS91 and C92 MMCs have nearly same hardness, however CS91 has less wear volume. Based on wear volume assessment, wear resistance can be arranged as; as-cast Mg<C92<CS91<C91.\nScratch hardness and indentation hardness measure plastic yield properties and thus are comparable.38,39 Converting the hardness value from Hv to GPa (1GPa¼ 0.009807*Hv40) and comparing Figures 14\nand 10 it can be noted that the indentation hardness is almost 12–15% lower than scratch hardness. It is worth noting here that, while estimating the indentation hardness, very high hardness values are discarded considering them as a response from continuous ceramic particles. This omission is not possible for scratch hardness estimation. Taking the above argument, it can be assumed that both the hardness values are the same. CS91 MMC has higher penetration than C91 MMC due to increased grain size and dissolved intermetallic. Traction force and depth of penetration are minimum during scratching of C91MMC, which leads to minimization of the area to be sheared during scratching. CS91 shows an increase in traction force due to an increase in penetration depth. However, penetration depth further increases in the case of the C92 sample, but traction force also decreases. This is attributed to a significant decrease in micro-ceramic chunks/agglomerates in the Mg-matrix. As-cast Mg shows a nominal increase in traction force despite a significant increase in penetration depth due to the absence of reinforcements in the matrix. On compression behaviour. Figure 15 shows the compressive stress-strain curve for different MMC samples. Taking as-cast Mg as a benchmark, it can be seen that significant improvement in mechanical properties is achieved. The yield point (Figure 15) of C92 MMC is comparable to CS91 MMC. Further, it can also be surmised that it is possible to increase and tune the strength and ductility of Mg-based composites through in-situ particle development. The MMC cast at low\ntemperature (C91) shows significant improvement in compressive strength with a decrease in the ductility as compared to as-cast Mg. Further, solution treatment (CS91) results in decrease in strength and little improvement in ductility. This can be explained through the dissolution of intermetallic and increased grain size. The MMC cast at higher temperature (C92) showed negligible decrease in ductility and increase in compressive strength as compared to as cast Mg. However, a significant decrease in stiffness is evident. Literature suggests a significant decrease in stiffness can be accounted because of porosity.41–43 As discussed in previous sections, a significant amount of porosity can be seen in the case of developed MMCs. These porosities contribute in reduction of strength as well as stiffness. The average pore size of 27 mm is found in case of C91 casting which leads to the emergence of small plasticity region during the compression test. The presence of porous cauliflower structure and poor\nbonding between ceramics and matrix (Figure 9(b)) at some locations might have contributed to a decrease in stiffness. However, CCP and ceramic agglomerates presence have countered there effect significantly. At the same time the presence of web like cauliflower particles might have arrested crack growth and stabilized plastic flow of C92 MMC. Solution treated MMC (CS91) has shown a little decrease in stiffness as compared to C91 MMC.\nCompression fractography. The fractured surfaces are analysed to understand the compression behaviour of different MMCs (Figure 16). In the case of as-cast Mg (Figure 16(a) to (c)), the fractured surface is smooth and shows the formation of river like pattern (Figure 16(a)), small facets (Figure 16(b)) along with sheet like structures (Figure 16(c)). This indicates the cleavage features are taken over by ductile features. The mixed fracture features are evidence of plastic deformation. The brittle fracture seems to be more contributing to the failure of the C91 composite (Figure 16 (d) to (f)). The feature noted from the SEM micrographs are; high roughed surface (Figure 16(d) and (e)), fragmented surface with kind of grain pull out phenomenon (Figure 16(d)), facets near pores (Figure 16(d)), localized plastic deformation (lip formation) (Figure 16(f)). Facets are probably due to intragranular crack propagation. The facets are present even for the solution treated MMC (CS91) (Figure 16 (h)), however some level of smoothening is also seen. This indicates the increased softness with similar nature of brittleness. The fracture surface of C92 MMC (Figure 16(i) to (k)) shows the phenomenon of sheet formation, material flow and ploughing. Some sheetlike structures have been stabilized by submicron particles (Figure 16(i) to (k)). The C92 MMC failed in a relatively more ductile manner. Chelliah et al. found in-\nsitu developed MMC at higher temperature showed brittle failure.44 It is important to mention, cauliflower structures are not identified on the failed surface."

      "heading" : "Strengthening contributions",
      "text" : "The strength of MMCs is governed by size, shape and volume of reinforcements.12,18,26,45–47 The role of different particles and their contribution to the strengthening of MMCs is explored as follows. The strength of MMC depends on the amount of dislocation present and their interaction with themselves (Taylor strengthening12,46,48), reinforcement particles (Orowan strengthening12,46,48) and grain boundaries (HallPetch strengthening12,46,48). Another important factor is load transfer from matrix to the reinforcements.12,46,48 Researchers have numerically discussed these factors in details.12,18,45–49\nThe change in YS of the MMCs is attributed to the size and volume of reinforcements. To estimates the contributions of, type of particles, volume percentage, average particle size and grain sizes have been analyzed through linear intercept method48 and summarized in Table 1 for different MMCs.\nTaylor strengthening is playing pivot role in strengthening. In magnesium although Taylor factor (¼6.5) is low,49 however, order of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) have been 1012 and 1013.\nThe individual effect of different strengthening mechanisms for all analytes has been shown in Figure 17. Nano/submicron particles are found to be the main contributor in Taylor strengthening in spite of their low volume fraction. As cast Mg showed grain size of 230 mm. Hall-Petch strengthening is higher in C91 samples as compared to C92 and CS-91 samples. Orowan strengthening contribution increases with a decrease in the size of reinforcements. Submicron/ nanoparticles have a major contribution to Orowan strengthening in all the MMCs. During calculation, it is assumed that dislocations do not cut through the particles and are completely restricted by them. Load transfer has a minimum contribution to strengthening behavior in all three cases. Moreover, it is negligible in the C92 MMC. Large reinforcements have a maximum contribution in load transfer.\nThe individual strengthening effects can be superimposed over a complete matrix using different models such as the Summation model, Zhang and Chen model and modified Clyne model.48 Experimental yield strength (point of commencement of plastic zone) and yield strength calculated through models is shown in Figure 18. Zhang and Chen model are dedicated to MMnCs and not account for grain size reduction and load transfer effects.\nChelliah et al.28 found that the Summation model supports the experimentation results of their MMCs, where considerable variation in type and size of reinforcement was present. In the present work, the experimental observation for MMCs is close to the modified Clyne model. However, all the models are within 20% of actual yield strength. Dislocations generated due to the difference in CTE is likely to be less due to slower cooling rate for C91 and C92 MMCs. Taking this argument modified Clyne model is closest to the experimental values."

In-situ generation of micro and nano particles in the Mg-melt is supposed to have a better bonding with the matrix. Ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) is added to initial Magnesium melt (with an aim to generate CeO2 and MgO through in-situ reaction) at temperatures of 670 C and 870 C. The developed MMCs are solution treated to get rid of intermetallic. The nature of particles is explored with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS). The morphology and sizes of particles are keenly jotted using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Mechanical responses of developed MMCs are recorded through Hardness, Compression and scratch tests. The compression fractured surfaces are analyzed with SEM and scratched samples are analyzed on 3D optical profilometer to explore deformation behavior. The observations indicate the in-situ formation of CeO2, MgO and CeMg12 intermetallic phases in different types and sizes. Further, these particles are responsible for improved mechanical properties. The findings are supported by the contribution of different strengthening mechanisms.",
