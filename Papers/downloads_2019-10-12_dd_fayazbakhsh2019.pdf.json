In doing so, A novel 1D copper(II) coordination polymer compound of [Cu(tp)(phen)]n (1) (tp¼ 1,4-benzendicarboxylic acid and phen: 1,10-Phenanthroline) was synthesized using two different methods, such as branched-tube and sonochemical methods. The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) results revealed that with applying both methods, the produced compounds have a same crystalline phase. A Single crystal X-ray analysis of produced compound 1 using the branched-tube method showed that Cu2þ ions are 6-coordinated. The contribution of intermolecular interactions in compound 1 were studied by Hirshfeld Surface Analysis method. The role of sonication power, reaction time, concentrations of reactants, temperature on the growth and final morphology of the obtained nanostructures were studied by the sonochemical method. While, the concentrations of reactants and reaction time directly affected the final size of nano-structures of compound 1, the sonication power and temperature showed an inverse impact. Compound 1 was used as a new precursors for preparation of Cu(II) oxide structures via solid-state thermal decomposition process. The nano-structures of compound 1 were further analyzed by IR spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

      "text" : "In recent decades, coordination polymers (CPs) have attracted great attentions among researchers of synthetic chemistry and materials science fields. Because these compounds possess unique structures with specific properties and reactivities compared with mononuclear compounds [1e10]. Among various incorporated metal ions to fabricate CPs, Cu(I) and Cu(II) have been a main component in a large number of CP's structures. Copper based CPs have been applied in a variety of practical applications [11e13].\nhoo.com, mj.soltanian@iauf. m (P. Hayati).\nUp to now, various approaches have been developed to assemble CPs such as slow diffusion of the reactants into a polymeric matrix, diffusion from the gas phase, evaporation of the solvent at ambient or reduced temperatures, precipitation or recrystallisation from a mixture of solvents, temperaturecontrolled cooling, hydrothermal and sono-chemical methods [14e20].\nRegarding the two important factors - amount of time needed and the homogeneity in the nucleation to prepare nanomaterials e sono-chemical method could be considered as an excellent choice in comparison with other mentioned methods [21]. The basic mechanism which employed by this method to affect a chemical reactions is the formation and collapsing bubbles generating extremely localized hot spots having pressures of about 1000 bar, temperatures of roughly 5000 K, and heating and cooling rates of\nTable 1 Crystal data and structure refinement for compound 1.\nCCDC deposit number 1922310 Molecular formula C20H12CuN2O4 MW 407.86 Crystal system Monoclinic Space group C2/c Z 4 a,b,c,b 15.3180 (9), 10.0629 (7), 10.3152 (8) (Å) 92.540 (6) ( ) Volume (Å3) 1588.46 (19) Calculated density (Mg/m3) 1.705 Absorption coefficient (mm 1) 1.41 T (K) 100 l (Å) 0.71073 F (000) 828 Crystal size (mm) 0.26 0.22 0.17 q range for data collection ( ) 3.1e28.9 Limiting indices h¼ 20/ 20, k¼ 13/ 13, l¼ 14/ 14 Reflections collected/unique 22544, 2108 R (int) 0.039 Max. and min. transmission 1.000, 0.921 Refinement method Full-matrix least-squares on F2 Data/restraints/parameters 2108/0/123 Goodness of fit GOF) on F2 1.00 R[F2 > 2s(F2)], wR(F2) 0.028, 0.060 Largest difference peak/hole (e.

The use of high-intensity ultrasound to enhance the reactivity of metals as a stoichiometric reagent has\nbecome a synthetic technique for many heterogeneous organic and organometallic reactions [23e28].\nNano scaled CPs such as nanoparticles, nano-cubes, nano-rods, and nanotubes with finite repeating units offering distinctive properties which could not be provide by bulk CPs, have been the main topic of synthetic studies recently [29]. However, CPs in the form of nanoparticles among other nanosized forms are the most\nature on the size of compound 1 particle.\nScheme 1.

      "text" : "Coordination environment is shown in Fig. 1. The bond lengths and bond angles covering the primary coordination sphere are shown in Table 2.\nThe asymmetric unit of compound 1 is composed of one Cu atom, one half terephthalic acid (tp), and one half 1,10- phenanthroline (phen). The investigation of crystal structure shows the formation of infinite 1D zigzag chain (Fig. 2) constructed from {Cu(phen)} nodes and tp2 linkers. In this polymeric structure, each copper atom is hexa-coordinated with a distorted octahedral geometry, giving a CuN2O4 chromophore: two nitrogen atoms from the phenanthroline ligand, and four oxygen atoms from two chelating carboxylate groups arising from two tp2 linkers. In this distorted octahedral geometry, the basal plane includes four atoms of N1, N1i, O1, and O1i, while two apical positions are occupied by O2 and O2i atoms. The deviation of nitrogen and oxygen atoms from the basal CuN2O2 plane is slight: 0.021 Å for N1 and N1i and 0.019 Å for O1 and O1i. The two apical oxygen atoms (O2 and O2i) lie above and below the basal CuN2O2 plane at 2.180 Å. The investigation of bond angles of the CuN2O4 chromophore indicate the angles of N1eCu1eO1 and N1'dCu1dO1’ equal to 172.99(5) for the trans atoms system of the basal plane and an angle of O2eCu1eO2’¼ 134.68 for the JahneTeller apical positions. Also, the basal and basal-apical bond angles are ranging from 81.52(7) to 95.36(6) and 54.94 e125.83 , respectively, showing the deviation from the ideal value of 90 . The bite angle for five-membered chelate ring arising from phenanthroline ligand (N1eCu1eN1i¼ 81.52(7) ) is in compliance with the mixed ligand Cu(II) complex containing phenanthroline and carboxylate ligands [47,48]. The order of the bond lengths around copper centre follows as: CueObasal< CueNbasal< CueOapical, which is also observable in six-coordinated Cu complex containing CuN2O4 chromophore [48e50]. Although the CueOapical bonds seems to be long (2.680 Å), but the larger values have been also reported in some Cu(II) complexes with similar structure (2.723 Å and 2.729 Å in [Cu(phen)(C6H5CO2 )2] and 2.724 Å in [Cu(C2H2BrO2)2(C12H8N2)] [51,52]. The specific lengthening of two axial CueO distances than those in the basal CuO2N2 plane represents a significant JahneTeller distortion.\nThe crystal lattice of 1D zigzag mercury(II) coordination polymer are further expanded by intermolecular interactions such as CeH/O and CeH$$$p. The interaction of O2 and O2i atoms (hydrogen bond acceptor) from carboxylate groups with C5 and C5i atoms (hydrogen bond donor) from pyridine rings of phenanthroline ligand creates the intra-chain CeH/O interactions on two side of each polymeric chain with the geometric parameters of H/O¼ 2.463 Å, C/O¼ 3.150(2) Å, and CeH/O angle¼ 129.16 . Also, the intra-chain CeH$$$p interactions form between H7 aromatic hydrogen from pyridine ring of phenanthroline ligand of one polymeric chain with phenyl cycle of dicarboxylates ligand from an adjacent polymeric chain. The geometric parameters of this\nped over dnorm (right) and shape index (left).\ninteraction are H$$$Cg distance¼ 2.880 Е and CeH$$$Cg angle¼ 154.33 (Cg: the centroid of phenyl cycle of dicarboxylate ligand). It should be noted, that each chain in the network is surrounded by six other ones, producing hexagonal shape of growth for the network (Fig. 3). Simplification of the chain to the underlying net reveals in Fig. 4 which is abundant for 1D coordination polymers. Also a fragment of the network in 1 was shown in Fig. 5."

The views of the Hirshfeld surface mapped over dnorm ( 1.196 to 1.160 Å) and shape\nindex ( 1.0 to 1.0 Å) have been shown in Fig. 6. The most prominent red spots on the dnorm surface of copper(II) coordination polymer are due to carbon-carbon bonds. In addition to, two distinct red spots around copper atom are attributed to Cu/N and Cu/O interactions. Also, the two pale red spots observed around the atoms of O2 and H5 is due to the participation of this two atoms in the formation of CeH/O intermolecular interactions. The C/H/H/C close contacts appears as very pale red spots or the white areas. These contacts which attributed to CeH$$$p interactions are visible as hollow orange areas (p$$$H) and bulging blue areas (H$$$p) on the shape index surface (Fig. 6).\nThe two-dimensional fingerprint plots of the sum of the contacts contributing tothe Hirshfeld surface have been shown in Fig. 7,\n(up) and nanostructure of 1 (down).\nrepresenting in normal mode.

The absence of this peak in the spectrum of complex and appearance of the characteristic bands of the carboxylate anions at 1584 cm 1 (nasym(COO )) and 1383 cm 1 (nsym(COO )) indicates complete deprotonation of the terephthalic acid (Fig. 8). The bonding mode of carboxylate anion to metal is characterized by the differences (D) between the asymmetric stretch (nasym(COO )) and symmetric stretch (nsym(COO )) vibrations and its comparison with the D value of free ionic carboxylic groups [53]. The asymmetric stretch (nasym(COO )) and symmetric stretch (nsym(COO )) vibrations of disodium terephthalate are observed at 1567 cm 1 and 1394 cm 1, respectively with the separation Dn [nasym(COO ) - nsym(COO )]¼ 173 cm 1.

In this method, sound waves propagates through a liquid at wavelengths that is significantly longer than that of the bond lengths between atoms in the molecule. Therefore, the sound waves cannot affect vibrational energy of the bond and, therefore, cannot directly increase the internal energy of a molecule. Instead, sono-chemistry arises from acoustic cavitation: the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of bubbles in a liquid. The collapse of these bubbles is\nared by calcination of 1 at 400 C.\nan almost adiabatic process, thereby, results in the massive buildup of energy inside the bubble and extremely high temperatures and pressures in a microscopic region of the sonicated liquid. The high temperatures and pressures result in the chemical excitation of any matter inside of, or in the immediate surroundings of the bubble as it rapidly imploded. Thus, this technique is quick, green with maximum yield, basic safety, energy savings, and uses normal conditions, prevent waste production, improves mass transfer compared to other technique such as layering, autoclave and diffusion [57,58].\nThe shape and size of 1 prepared by the ultrasound method were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM images of 1 prepared by ultrasonic generator 60W with initial reagents concentrations of [Cu2þ]¼ [tp]¼ [phen]¼ 0.1mol L 1 in Fig.14 showedmixed-morphology (mainly flake 2Dmorphologies). The results showed that as the power of ultrasonic irradiation increased, the particles sizes decreased (Fig. 14 a, b) and demonstrated that optimum time was 30min to achieve nano particles (Fig. 14 b, c). It was found that with the increase in the concentration of reactants, the particle sizes was also increased whereas a converse effect was observed after increasing temperature of reagents (Fig. 14 b, e). According to Table 3 and Fig. 14, the best setting in obtaining a less agglomerated 2D nanostructures of 1 was the power of ultrasonic irradiation, reaction time, concentration of reactants and temperature of 60W, 60min, 0.5M and (Table 3 (1- 5); Fig. 14e). The other suitable setting as well was the power of ultrasonic irradiation, reaction time, concentration of reactants and temperature of 60W, 30min, 0.5M and 50 C, respectively (Table 3 (1-3); Fig. 14c).\nAs the interactions between molecules are one of the most important factors that greatly influences particles morphology. The formation of 1 could be postulated as the result of the strong C/H intermolecular forces (Hirshfeld surface analysis and Fig. 11) among 2D networks (Fig. 2), on a-axis, leading to a formation of nanostructures growing more on this direction, a-axis, promoting the flake structures. Otherwise, with reducing this strong C/H intermolecular interaction, on a-axis, the growing of nanostructures could be the same order on y, z and a-axis leading to the formation of the small 3D on higher temperature (Table 3). Thus, the nuclei\nare formed, following diffusion control growths of them occurred and flake morphologies were formed {Fig. 14 b and c}. On the other hand, it is interesting that compound 1 is a 1D coordination polymer in the solid-state (Fig. 2) and formation of 2 and 3D particles by sonochemical process may be as a result of 1D coordination polymer chains self-assembly (Fig. 14e). Flakes morphology (2D) was converted to small cubes morphology (3D) when compound 1 was exposed to 1-5 setting (Fig. 14 and Table 3)."

      "text" : "A novel Cu(II) coordination polymer compound, [Cu(tp)(phen)]n (1), was synthesized utilizing a thermal gradient approach and sono-chemical irradiation. Space group was determined to be monoclinic space group (C2/c) by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal packing of compound 1 was studied using Hirshfeld surface analysis. The effects of ultrasound power, reaction time, concentration of reactants and temperature on the shape of [Cu(tp)(phen)]n (1), was investigated and various morphology {flake (2D) like} of nanostructures of compound [Cu(tp)(phen)]n (1) were obtained. The results indicated that higher temperature and ultrasound power led to decrease in particle size with an optimum time of 30min. Finally, the best setting for the producing smaller particles was found to be as follows: the power of ultrasonic irradiation of 60W, reaction time 60min, concentration of reactants of 0.1M and temperature of 70 C.\nSupplementary data\nCrystallographic data for the structure reported in this paper have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre as supplementary publication No. CCDC- 1922310.

    "abstractText" : "The purpose of the present study was to investigate a simple approach for synthesis of new 1D copper (II) coordination polymer as a precursor for preparation of nano-structures based on crystallography and Hirshfeld surface analysis method. In doing so, A novel 1D copper(II) coordination polymer compound of [Cu(tp)(phen)]n (1) (tp1⁄4 1,4-benzendicarboxylic acid and phen: 1,10-Phenanthroline) was synthesized using two different methods, such as branched-tube and sonochemical methods. The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) results revealed that with applying both methods, the produced compounds have a same crystalline phase. A Single crystal X-ray analysis of produced compound 1 using the branched-tube method showed that Cu2þ ions are 6-coordinated. The contribution of intermolecular interactions in compound 1 were studied by Hirshfeld Surface Analysis method. The role of sonication power, reaction time, concentrations of reactants, temperature on the growth and final morphology of the obtained nanostructures were studied by the sonochemical method. While, the concentrations of reactants and reaction time directly affected the final size of nano-structures of compound 1, the sonication power and temperature showed an inverse impact. Compound 1 was used as a new precursors for preparation of Cu(II) oxide structures via solid-state thermal decomposition process. The nano-structures of compound 1 were further analyzed by IR spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
