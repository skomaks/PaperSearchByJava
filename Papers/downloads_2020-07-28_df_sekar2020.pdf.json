      "text" : "Due to both the anxiety of environmental complications and the scarcity of fossil fuels, renewable energy sources have been of vast interest to realize green energy technology [1–3]. Hydrogen is one of the most efficient, renewable, and clean energy sources for future eco-energy technology. Among various hydrogen production techniques, the electrocatalytic water electrolysis is a simple and efficient route to produce clean and renewable hydrogen energy [4,5]. In this otherwise powerful technique, there is a crucial fact that the water-splitting efficiency strongly relies on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [6]. Recently, Ir/Ru-based oxides are deemed to be a benchmark of the high-performance OER electrocatalysts because of their most active sites and high water-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency [7,8]. Despite such benefits, the tangible applications of Ir/Ru-based oxides have been restricted due to their rapid deactivation, scarcity, and high cost [9–11]. Therefore, many researchers have devoted to develop a cheap, stable, and highly efficient OER electrocatalysts. In very recent years, nickel-based conjugates [12–19] and nickel oxide (NiO) nanostructures [20–31] have been demonstrated as a promising OER electrocatalyst because of their fast response, high corrosion resistance, earth abundance, low cost, high surface kinetic reaction, and good stability. However, the electrocatalytic OER performances of the NiO nanostructures are still unsatisfiable because of their sluggish kinetics, low electronic conductivity, and limited active\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1382; doi:10.3390/nano10071382 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1382 2 of 13\nsites [32,33]. To release such drawbacks, thus, anchoring of NiO with carbonaceous materials (e.g., carbon particles [32], carbon nanotubes [33,34], carbon fibers [35], carbon nanowires [36], activated carbon (AC) [37], graphene [38–40], reduced graphene oxide [41,42], etc.) has been proposed as an effective way to improve the electrical conductivity as well as the vigorous kinetic reaction. For instance, Hoang et al. [37] synthesized Ni/NiO/N-doped AC by using cauliflower leaves, and they showed a low overpotential of 346 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 70 mV/dec. Faisal et al. [40] also reported a low overpotential of 410 mV at 10 mA/cm2 when using the Ni/NiO/N-graphene composites as an OER electrocatalyst. Very recently, Mugheri et al. [32] achieved a very low overpotential of 220 mV and a small Tafel slope of 55 mV/dec from NiO/C electrocatalysts. Amongst the various carbonaceous materials, AC is one of the most substantial candidates for synthesizing high-performance AC-NiO nanocomposites because of its large surface area, high conductivity, high durability [43–47]. Furthermore, due to its environmental friendliness, vast abundance, fast regeneration, and low cost, biomass-derived AC has attracted extensive attention from the next-generation energy technology community [43–47]. However, most of all previous works have still used some chemical solutions (e.g., solvents and/or acids) for the formation of both electrocatalysts and carbonaceous materials [20–47]. Therefore, developing an ecofriendly and chemical-free synthesis method is essential to realize the fully green energy technology. Motivated by all the above, we investigated the green-synthesis of AC-NiO nanocomposites for obtaining the high-performance OER electrocatalysts. In this article, we report on experimental data for the chemical-free synthesis of AC-NiO nanotablets and their excellent OER characteristics. The nanocomposites were fabricated by the fully ecofriendly-route of the water-assisted sonication by using biomass-derived AC nanosponges and sonochemically-prepared NiO nanoparticles in pure water. The AC-NiO nanotablets showed the remarkable OER performances with a very low overpotential (320 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH) and a considerably small Tafel slope (49 mV/dec). Herein, the formation kinetics, material properties, and electrocatalytic characteristics of the AC-NiO nanotablets are systematically assessed and discussed in detail."

First, a bundle of human hair was washed in DI water several times, and dried by sunlight for 6 h. After that, the cleaned human hair was burned in an open environment to collect its ashes. Finally, the ashes were carbonized at 300 ◦C for 2 h in an alumina crucible under nitrogen atmosphere. Through these steps, we were able to obtain the powder type of high-quality biomass-AC nanosponges (Figure S1)."

Then, each of mixture slurries was coated on the stainless steel substrates (1 cm2), and dried at 150 ◦C for 5 h. We, here, note that the platinum mesh and the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as a counter electrode and a reference electrode, respectively. After fabricating the NiO and the AC-NiO working electrodes, the electrochemical OER performances were examined in a 1 M KOH electrolyte by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements using a three-electrode system (VersaSTAT3, Ametek Scientific Instruments, Berwyn, PA, USA). We, here, note that KOH electrolyte was prepared by using standard grade KOH pellets (Sigma Aldrich, Seoul, Republic of Korea) and DI water. LSV measurements were carried out at the scan rate (rs) of 1 mV/s in the potential range of 0.1–0.8 V (vs. SCE), and the CV characteristics were evaluated at various scan rates (rs = 10–100 mV/s) in a potential window of 0–0.5 V (vs. SCE). The chronopotentiometric measurement of the NiO and AC-NiO electrodes were performed at various injection current densities (Ji) of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 100 mA/cm2, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at a frequency range of 1 Hz to 10 kHz."

In order to help understanding the formation kinetics of the AC-NiO nanocomposites via the solvent-free green routes, we here interpret the reaction mechanism of the water-assisted sonication method. For the sonochemical reaction in aqueous solution, water (H2O) generates two primary radicals of hydrogen (H*) and hydroxyl (OH*).

Namely, the ion storage and the OER catalytic activity were greater for the AC-NiO nanotablets, compared to the pristine NiO nanoparticles.\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1382 7 of 13\nNext, we measured the LSV characteristics at rs = 1 mV/s for the NiO and the AC-NiO OER electrodes. From the iR-corrected LSV curves (Figure 6a), the overpotential (η) of the NiO sample was extracted to be 360 mV at 10 mA/cm2, while the AC-NiO sample showed a lower η value of 320 mV at 10 mA/cm2.\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, x; doi: FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 12\nNext, we measured the LSV characteri t s 1 V/s for the NiO and the AC-NiO OER lectrodes. From the iR-co rected LSV curves ( i ), t erpotential (η) of the NiO sample was extracted to be 360 mV at 10 mA/cm2, while the AC-NiO sample showed a lower η value of 320 V at 10 mA/cm2.\nFigure 6.

Namely, the Tafel slope was determined to be 76 and 49 mV/dec for the NiO and the AC-NiO OER electrodes (Figure 6b), respectively, from the Tafel equation [11]: ɳ log (6)\nHere, a and sT are the fitting parameter and the Tafel slope, respectively. The values of η and sT were comparable or even much lower than those of earlier OER studies based on Ni and/or NiO (see Table 1). Particularly, the AC-NiO OER electrode shows a very lower overpotential, a higher current, and a smaller Tafel slope. Since those parameters are directly associated with the catalytically active sites and the intrinsic reaction kinetics [20,37,42], we could conjecture that the OER activity was dramatically increased in the AC-NiO OER electrode. In other words, the above results rarified the aforementioned hypothesis that the aggregation of AC-NiO nanocomposites could enhance the OER characteristics due to the increased electrical conductivity and the enlarged electrochemically active area.\nFigure 6.

Namely, the Tafel slope was d termin d to be 76 and 49 mV/dec for the NiO and the AC-NiO OER electrodes (Figure 6b), respectively, f om the Tafel equation [11]:\nη = sT log (J) + a (6)\nHere, a nd sT ar the fitting parameter and the Tafel slope, respectively. The values of η and sT wer comparable or even much lower than those of earlier OER studies based on Ni and/or NiO (see Table 1). Particularly, the AC-NiO OER electrode shows a very lo er overpotenti , a higher curr nt, and a smaller Taf l slope. Since those paramet rs are directly associ ted with the catalytic lly active sites and the intrinsic reaction kinetics [20,37,42], we could conjecture that the OER activity was dramatically increased in the AC-NiO OER electrode. In other words, the above results rarified the aforementioned hypothesis that the aggregation of AC-NiO nanocomposites could enhance the OER characteristics due to the increased electrical conductivity and the enlarged electrochemically active area.\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1382 8 of 13\nSuch a superior OER catalytic activity can also affect the chronopotentiometric characteristics. As shown in the chronopotentiometric curves (Figure 6c), the AC-NiO OER electrode exhibited a lower overpotential response at each Ji than that of the pristine NiO OER electrode. Furthermore, the AC-NiO OER electrode also showed a better performance in the long-term durability test. As displayed in Figure 6d, the stability slope was more stable for the AC-NiO OER electrode than pristine NiO. Initially, the static voltage profile increased due to the activation of the catalytic reaction; however, the potential value gradually decreased and constantly maintained after few hours because of the stabilization of the electrode material. Namely, NiOOH might be formed on the surface of AC-NiO after few hours of the OER events [33,37], as discussed later. Moreover, the LSV curves were almost identical before and after the 10 h OER stability test (see Figure S4). These signify that the AC-NiO OER electrode could offer a stable electrocatalytic OER activity in KOH medium for a quite long time. After OER stability, we carried out FE-SEM and Raman scattering measurements to further elucidate the microstructural and chemical bonding properties of the electrodes. From FE-SEM measurements, the NiO electrode showed the aggregated structure of the hexagonal nanoparticles (see Figure S5a). However, the AC-NiO electrode still maintained their original nanotablets structure (see Figure S5b). In Raman spectrum (see Figure S6), both the NiO and AC-NiO electrodes exhibited the additional bands at 330 cm−1 and 478 cm−1, corresponding to the presence of NiOOH [60–62]. This corroborates the aforementioned hypothesis that NiOOH was formed on AC-NiO after the OER stability test. Finally, the EIS measurements were performed at 1 Hz to 10 kHz to investigate the catalytic kinetic reaction of the electrodes. Figure 7a,b displays the Nyquist plots of the NiO and the AC-NiO OER electrodes, respectively. In both cases, the EIS spectra exhibited a linear feature in the low frequency region because of the dispersion of electrolyte within the electrode. Here, it should be noticeable that no semicircles were observable in the high frequency region. Since the semicircle was related to the charge transfer resistance [38,42] as well as the series resistance, the absence of the semicircle presents the decreases in both the electronic and the ionic resistance in the electrochemical scheme [63,64]. For the NiO and the AC-NiO OER electrodes, the series resistance values were determined to be 2.16 and 1.57 Ω, respectively. Therefore, we could conclude that the enhanced OER performances originated from the higher electrical conductivity and the lower ionic resistance in the AC-NiO nanocomposite system.\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1382 9 of 13\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, x; doi: FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 12\nperformances originated from the higher electrical conductivity and the lower ionic resistance in the AC-NiO nanocomposite system.\nFigure 7.

Herein, we synthesized the nanocomposites of activated carbon-anchored nickel oxide (AC-NiO) via fully green routes, and characterized their excellent OER performances. The AC-NiO nanocomposites were prepared by the facile sonication method using sonochemically prepared NiO nanoparticles and biomass-derived AC nanosponges. The nanocomposites exhibited an aggregated structure of the AC-NiO nanotablets with an average size of 40 nm. When using the nanotablets as an OER catalyst in 1 M KOH, the sample displayed superb electrocatalytic performances, i.e., a substantially low value of overpotential (320 mV at 10 mA/cm2), a significantly small Tafel slope (49 mV/dec), and a good OER stability (4% decrease of overpotential after 10 h). These outstanding OER characteristics are considered as attributing to the synergetic effects from both the ample surface area of the electrochemically active NiO nanoparticles and the high electrical conductivity of the AC nanosponges. The results pronounce that the fully ecofriendly synthesized AC-NiO nanotablets can play a splendid role as high-performance electrocatalysts for future green energy technology.",
