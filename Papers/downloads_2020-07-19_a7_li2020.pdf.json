Natural SEI layer has a heterogeneous structure, results in the inhomogeneous Liþ diffusion. The repeated destruction and regeneration of SEI aggravate the inhomogeneity of Liþ diffusion at the interface, leading to non-uniform alloy reaction in the Si bulk. In this work, the silicon surface is passivated by an ultrathin uniform chitosan layer with abundant lithiophilic groups. The capacity of chitosancoated Si (Si@CS) could reach 1500 mAh g 1 at a current density of 1 A g 1, and the capacity retention remains 91% after 400 cycles. It is demonstrated that the oxygen and nitrogen atoms in chitosan are coordinated with Liþ, providing uniformly distributed Liþ transfer sites, results in a homogeneous Liþ flux in the surface layer. Interestingly, a nano-scale ordered atomic arrangement is observed in the delithiated Si@CS, which contributes to more stable and reversible lithiation/delithiation reaction of the Si@CS electrode. It is proposed that optimizing the reaction interface on the Si surface is able to alter the Li-ion diffusion kinetics and structure transition behavior of silicon, which can improve the structure reversibility and stability during cycling."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Lithium-ion battery (LIB) is the most widely used energy storage device. Si has been proven as a promising anode material for nextgeneration LIBs with high energy density due to its high theoretical capacity (3572 mAh g 1 when Li15Si4 phase forms) and low lithiation potential (mostly under 0.3 V vs. Liþ/Li) [1,2]. But the formation of Li15Si4 alloy causes huge volume expansion exceeding 300%, leading to poor working stability of Si anode [3]. Researchers have found that Si bulk will not crack when particle size is below 150 nm [4]. Although nano-scaled Si particles show improved cycling stability compared to micro Si, the rapid capacity fading still exists. In addition to the particle pulverization problem caused by volume expansion, other issues should be also taken into account. The damage and regeneration of SEI layer caused by huge volume change results in the thickening of SEI film after each cycle. The SEI layer can withstand the volume change of Si and fully insulate the electrons from electrolyte after it grows thick on the Si surface, but the ion conductivity of Si anode is greatly reduced, together\nwith a large consumption of the electrolyte. More seriously, the natural SEI layer is composed of highly reduced compounds in the inner layer (mainly inorganic lithium salts, such as LiF, Li2CO3, LiOH, et al.) and low level reduced compounds in the outer layer (mainly organic lithium salts such as ROCO2Li, ROLi, et al.) [5,6]. It is highly porous due to the release of the gas such as CO2 and H2.[7–9] Cracks always emerge in this composite layer due to huge volume change and are filled with newly reduced SEI composites during the subsequent lithiation process. The SEI layer consists of various compounds with different Liþ diffusion rate, providing an inhomogeneous Liþ flux to access the SEI/Si-interface. Such an inhomogenious Liþ flux will cause the lithiation differential at the surface of Si particle, results in nonuniform lithiation reaction of Si. To solve these problems, researchers have designed many delicate structures to invalidate the impact of Si volume change, such as yolk-shell [10], porous [11], hollow [12,13], core-shell [14–16] and various self-standing [17,18] structures, which greatly stabilize the SEI layer formed during lithiation process. However, the amorphous carbon coating is usually attained through low temperature reduction of the\n* Corresponding author. ** Corresponding author. *** Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: fangchun@hust.edu.cn (C.

What’s more, the carbon coating fails to suppress the formation of the SEI layer, and it will further causes the nonuniform Liþ injection into the carbon coating. Together, they fail to approve a uniform lithiation process in the Si bulk. There are also works [20–22] applying polymers to coat on the Si and improve the performance of the Si electrode, but synthesizing such polymers are usually either complicated or costly, not suitable for large scale production. And most of them are electron conducting polymers and enabling abundant natural SEI formation, result in complex coating property, and cause nonuniform Liþ transfer at the polymer coating/Si-interface. The polymer artificial SEI layer is effective in stabilizing the Liþ exchange process at the interface of lithium metal anode to suppress the formation of the dendrites [23,24]. It is presumed Liþ conducting polymer could be functioning in the same way in Si anode, to avoid the pulverization and stabilize the Si electrode structure during lithiation/delithiation process.\nIn this work, we propose a facile way to passivate the Si/electrolyte interface with lithiophilic chitosan layer, which could provide a stable and controlled homogeneous Liþ transporting flux to ensure a more homogeneous lithiation process in the bulk of Si. Chitosan is an environment friendly, cheap and nontoxic polymer, and the chitosan modified Si particles can be sythesized only by low-temperature annealing with low energy consumption and no pollution. Moreover, the O and N atoms in glucosamine units have high affinity to Liþ. The random lithiophilic chains promote the dissociation of lithium salt by isolating Liþ ions from electrolyte anions and provide hopping sites for Liþ ion transfer, forming homogeneous and effective Liþ transporting flux to access Si surface. Additionally, the chitosan layer separates the silicon surface from electrolyte and suppresses the destruction and regeneration of SEI film. Benefitted from the above, the capacity of chitosan coated Si (Si@CS) could reach 1500 mAh g 1 at a current density of 1 A g 1, and retains more than 91% after 400 cycles. Some nano-scale ordered domains are observed within the Si@CS particle, with rather low Liþ diffusion resistance. In sharp contrast, the bare silicon appears to complete disorder and fracture after repeated lithiation and delithiation cycles. It is believed that chitosan layer provides pathways for extremely uniform Liþ diffusion that enable a highly reversible alloy/dealloy reactions with silicon. Furthermore, the flexible polymer coating can relieve the stress during the volume expansion of silicon, which cannot be ignored for the structural stability. We demonstrate that the surface passivating layer plays an important role in lithiation process. A homogeneous and lithiophilic surface layer can result in a more stable and orderly delithiated Si structure, and hence further improve the Liþ diffusion kinetics in the bulk of Si particles."

The typical active mass loading was determined to be 0.6–0.8 mg cm 2 including the mass of chitosan coating. The bare Si electrode was prepared by the same procedure as Si@CS electrode.

For Si@CS, a uniform and continuous amorphous coating layer is observed on the surface of Si, with a thickness estimated to be 3 nm (Fig. 1f).

      "text" : "The chitosan-modified silicon electrode (Si@CS) has a greatly improved cyclability (Fig. 1i). Higher reversible capacity and better capacity retention could be observed in the Si@CS electrode than the bare Si electrode after 100 cycles at a current density of 400 mA g 1. For the bare Si electrode, a reversible capacity of 814 mAh g 1 obtained at\nthe 100th cycle, with a capacity retention of only 47.9%. For Si@CS-3% electrode, the reversible capacity reaches 1443 mAh g 1 with a capacity retention of 92.2% after 100 cycles. For Si@CS-5% electrode, the capacity is 1532 mAh g 1 while the capacity retention is 96.7%. The Coulombic efficiency of Si@CS electrode reaches 98.7% within 7 cycles, while the bare Si electrode takes 30 cycles to reach 98.2%. In the subsequent cycling, the Si@CS electrode displays higher Coulombic efficiency. What’s more, the Si@CS electrode presents an improved cyclability than bare Si even at high current density of 1 A g 1 (Fig. 1j), and the stability is further improved with more than 91% capacity retention after 400 cycles by raising the chitosan mass ratio to 5:100 (compared to Si mass). The discharge/charge curves of various electrodes at different cycles are illustrated in Fig. 1k-m. The capacity decreases as the mass ratio of chitosan coating increases during the initial cycles. All the electrodes exhibit an obvious plateau at the potential of 0.1 V vs. Liþ/Li during the initial cycle, indicative of phase transition of crystal Si to amorphous LixSi. Large polarization is observed in Si@CS due to the incomplete activation of the chitosan layer, which can be demonstrated by the continuous increase in capacity during the initial 20 cycles (Fig. 1i and j); whereas the capacity of bare Si electrode fades\nL. Li et al.\nNano Energy 72 (2020) 104651\ngradually over cycling. At the 150th cycle (Fig. 1m), the Si@CS-5% electrode exhibits the highest reversible capacity and the lowest polarization under 1 A g 1. The rate performances are compared in Fig. 1n. The chitosan layer greatly improves the rate capability of Si electrode. Si@CS anode can regain above 80% (nearly 100% for coating mass ratio ¼ 5:100) of the initial capacity when the current density returns to 100 mA g 1. For the Si@CS electrode, high rate causes low capacity, which is due to the low electron conduction rather than electrode failure in bare Si anode. Pursuing thick coating layer would finally lead to the withdrawing of the performance due to the blocking of the electron conduction. If the coating is too thin, it would not provide enough mechanical strength to bear the stress caused by volume change of Si, or even unable to fully cover the surface of Si particles. So, a proper chitosan layer thickness is rather important for Si electrode to improve the electrochemical performance."

      "heading" : "3.3. Morphological changes of the electrodes after cycling",
      "text" : "The surface morphology of pristine and cycled bare Si, Si@CS electrodes are depicted in Fig. 2a–d. Particle aggregations are observed in bare Si electrode, and the electrode is covered with thick SEI layers. The cracks and holes caused by repeated huge volume change detach the electrode materials. However, for the Si@CS electrode, even after 100 cycles, the particles are uniformly dispersed with sizes comparable to the pristine form. The thickening of SEI films is not obvious. It seems that the chitosan coating layer prevents the aggregation of Si particles. The cross section images of pristine bare Si, Si@CS electrodes are also shown in Fig. 2e-f. Both electrodes show the initial thickness of around 10 μm. After 100 cycles at 1 A g 1, the thickness of bare Si electrode expands to 37.1 μm, while the Si@CS electrode only expands to 21.9 μm (Fig. 2g–h). It is also found that more expanded cracks and particle pulverization occur in the bare Si electrode. And the chitosan modified electrode is much denser, suggesting that the chitosan layer significantly restricts the thickness increase of the electrode, which is resulted from Si volume change and continuous SEI growth. To further investigate the passivating effect of the chitosan layer, TEM images of Si particles in both electrodes are compared after 100 cycles. The crystalline Si particles in\nboth electrodes transform into amorphous phase (Fig. 2k-l). As shown in Fig. 2l, the Si particles in Si@CS maintain the integrity after cycling and the intact chitosan layer uniformly covers on the surface of the Si particles. The chitosan layer could withstand the repeated Si volume change of multiple discharge and charge process so that the Si@CS particles remain stable and are not pulverized (Fig. 2j). In comparison, the bare Si particles undergo agglomerating and crushing after cycling (Fig. 2i). Thick and non-uniform SEI layer is observed on the surface of Si. The Si particles become porous and shattered after repeated lithiation and delithiation process, which the pores are filled with decomposed electrolyte molecules, forming 3D interphase to slightly penetrate into the silicon structure. This process promotes the growth of thick SEI and cracks the particles, resulting in fracture and failure of the electrode. Although Si particles become amorphous for both electrodes after cycling, as confirmed by XRD patterns in Fig. 3a, some differences can be found in the crystal lattice patterns between bare Si and Si@CS in Fig. 2k-l. For bare Si particle, no obvious lattice pattern is observed and the local structure is totally disordered. For Si@CS (Fig. 2l), the Si particles show some short-range ordering, and the ordered nanodomains are confirmed by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in insets of Fig. 2k-l."

      "text" : "To further identify the different atomic order arrangement observed in TEM images between bare Si and Si@CS particle after cycling, Raman scattering test was applied as it is sensitive to the crystallinity of silicon. Fig. 3b illustrates Raman spectra of the pristine bare Si and Si@CS electrodes. A symmetric peak emerges at 520 cm 1 for both electrodes, which is assigned to crystalline Si. After 5 cycles, the bare Si electrode shows a broad peak at around 475 cm 1 with a width of more than 150 cm 1, corresponding to typical amorphous phase of silicon [25,26]. For the Si@CS electrode after 5 cycles, apart from a weak broad peak at 475 cm 1, an asymmetric narrow peak is located at 515 cm 1, revealing some short-range ordered nanoclusters (2–10 nm) formed within Si@CS particles after repeated lithiation and delithiation cycles [27,28]. In order to eliminate the possibility of existence of unalloyed crystalline\nL. Li et al.\nNano Energy 72 (2020) 104651\nsilicon caused by insufficient lithiation reaction, the bare Si electrode was cycled with controlled capacity corresponding to nearly the same lithiation amount of Si@CS electrode (TEM images is shown in Fig. S1). The Raman spectra are similar to those of the uncontrolled cycled bare Si electrode, indicating amorphous and totally disordered state. Previous works [29,30] have revealed that Si tends to form disordered amorphous LixSi phase while x is below 3.75. Both TEM images and Raman spectra support that the chitosan layer, as a buffer layer between silicon and electrolyte, plays an important role in the arrangement of Si atoms during the lithiation and delithiation process.\nThe cyclic voltammetry curves of bare Si and Si@CS electrodes are illustrated in Figs. S2a–b. Three obvious reduction peaks appear during initial lithiation process. The two peaks between 0.5 and 1.5 V vs. Liþ/Li in the first cycle represent the SEI layer formation for both electrodes. A broad cathodic peak around 0.1 V is caused by the first lithiation process of crystalline Si. While in the case of Si@CS electrode, all the reduction peaks are located at lower potentials than those of bare Si electrode, which should be attributed to the low electron conductivity caused by chitosan coating. Lower voltage is needed to accumulate enough electron density at the electrode surface to activate the reduction of the solvent molecules. From the CV curves, two oxidation peaks of Si@CS electrode are located at 0.347 and 0.521 V, indicative of de-alloy reactions involve different amorphous LixSi phase transformations. The anodic peaks for Si@CS electrode are observed at lower potential with more defined profiles than those of bare Si anode. It suggests that the chitosan layer passivation makes electrolyte molecules harder to be reduced, and hinders the formation of the SEI layer.\nThe ATR spectra of chitosan films were tested to figure out the interaction between Liþ ions and chitosan layer, as seen in Fig. S2c. The peak shifts for annealed chitosan films suggest that the annealing process relaxes the chitosan chain. After fully soaking the chitosan film in electrolyte, the characteristic absorption peaks of some functional groups change. The H–N–H scissoring vibration peak of amine shifts from 1640.89 to 1636.78 cm 1, the in-plane bending vibration peak of N–H in imide shifts from 1546.22 to 1534.77 cm 1, the C–O–H in-plane bending vibration peak shifts from 1375.70 to 1371.49 cm 1, the absorption peak of deformations of pyranose rings shifts from 1315.41 to 1300.97 cm 1, the stretching peak of C–N in the amine group shifts from 1151.34 to 1149.27 cm 1, and the C–O–C symmetric stretching peak shifts from 895.67 to 891.68 cm 1. The C–C–O asymmetric stretching peak shifts to higher wavenumber (from 1023.80 to 1026.71 cm 1). The shifts of those characteristic absorption peaks are attributed to chelation of Liþ with the N and O containing groups on the chitosan chains (see detailed discussion in supporting information). While the chelation occurs, the solvated-Liþ removes the solvation sheath. The ligand groups provide the hopping sites for Liþ ions to transport through the chitosan layer and enter the sub-surface of silicon, leading to a solid phase alloy reaction. The FTIR spectra of bare Si and Si@CS electrodes before and\nafter cycling are illustrated in Figs. S2d–e. After 5 cycles, the peaks at around 1487, 1440 and 865 cm 1 are related to the vibration of the carbonate groups in Li2CO3, and the peak located at 1303 cm 1 corresponds to the C–O vibration of the carbonate groups in ROCO2Li, suggesting that SEI layer is formed in both electrodes during cycling [31, 32], but those peaks in Si@CS electrode are much weaker, the SEI formation in the Si@CS electrode is largely suppressed. The Liþ conductivity of the chitosan layer at room temperature is tested to be 2.114 � 10 8 S cm 1 (Fig. S3), comparable to the reported data [33], and even match to natural PEO [34]. All the results prove that the chitosan layer is not just an inactive coating to restrain the Si pulverization through physical constrains, but also serves as an active Liþ conducting layer to transfer Liþ ions with the ligand groups such as –NH2, C–O–C, –NH–CO-, –OH. These uniformly distributed groups provide Liþ ion transport sites, which ensure a homogeneous Liþ distribution density in the passivating layer (Fig. S11).\nTo further identify the chemical composition of the electrode surfaces, XPS measurements of both Si and Si@CS electrode after 100 cycles are obtained (Fig. 4). The high resolution spectra of F 1s (Fig. 4a–d) indicate that the main fluorine-containing component at the surface of both electrodes is LiF. The Li 1s spectra in Fig. 4b, e suggest that the Licontaining compounds are mainly LiF (55.9 eV), Li2O (53.7 eV), Li2CO3 and ROCO2Li (55.5 eV) for both electrodes [35]. Fig. 4g compares the component contents between the surfaces of two electrodes. It is clear that the chitosan layer raises the proportion of LiF from 18.81 to 43.38%, and decreases proportion of Li2CO3 and ROCO2Li from 72.92 to 48.36%, indicating that much less decomposition of carbonate species occurs during the cycling for Si@CS electrode. The C 1s spectra in Fig. 4c,f also show a decrease of CO3 (289.5 eV) concentration and an increase of the C–O (286.5 eV) proportion on the surface of Si@CS electrode, indicating the existence of the chitosan layer and suppression of further reduction of the organic lithium salts into Li2CO3. This demonstrates that the chitosan layer enables a more robust LiF-rich SEI layer, and suppresses electrolyte decomposition."

      "text" : "The Nyquist plots in Fig. 5a–b shows two semicircles occurred in the high and medium frequency region. The semicircle within the high frequency region (in the inset of Fig. 5a–b) is related to the interface resistance between the electrolyte and the surface layer on the Si, corresponding to the phase angle peak at 103–105 Hz in the bode plots, as shown in Figs. S4a–b. The large semicircle in the medium frequency is associated with the phase angle peak at 1–10 Hz, representing the charge transfer process at the interface between surface layer and the silicon, which is coupled with the diffusion process in the surface layer. The interfacial impedance and charge transfer impedance of both electrodes decrease gradually with cycling while the impedance for Si@CS\nL. Li et al.\nNano Energy 72 (2020) 104651\nL. Li et al.\nNano Energy 72 (2020) 104651\nelectrode tends to be stable, indicating that there is an activation process in the initial stage of the lithiation and delithiation reaction. The Bode plots in Figs. S4a–b show the similar curve profiles and corresponding frequencies for both electrodes after 100 cycles, suggesting that the charge transfer process between surface layer and the silicon evolves into a solid state reaction after multiple cycles. However, the solid state reaction in the interfacial layer occurs after dozens of cycles for Si@CS electrode, while occurs after hundreds of cycles for bare Si electrode.\nSince the EIS was measured to 0.01 Hz, Warburg impedance was partially overlapped with signals of other electrochemical processes. However, the derivative distribution of relaxation time (DRT) function plots γ(τ) in Fig. 5c–d, calculated with the DRT tools on the Matlab platform developed by Ciucci group [36,37] (calculation details in supporting information), gives a clear kinetic information about the electrochemical reactions. Peaks in γ(τ) could be classified into different electrochemical processes in the electrode based on the value of τ. The peak above 10 s (<0.01 Hz) is attributed to the Li-ion diffusion in Si bulk. The peak located in 1–10 s corresponds to the phase angle peak around 1 Hz in bode plots, which is caused by Liþ diffusion process in the surface layer [38] (as discussed in supporting information). According to previous research, the signals located at τ > 1 s (frequency below 1/2π Hz) are related to the solid diffusion process [39]. The peaks in γ(τ) below 10 3 s are evolved from the phase angle peak around 104 Hz in bode plots, which are attributed to the interface reaction process between electrolyte and the surface layer [40]. According to the region division of the frequency and time constant, the peaks of γ(τ) located between 10 3 - 1 s are the result of charge transfer between surface layer and Si bulk [40,41]. Based on the above peaks attribution, an equivalent circuit of the electrode are proposed in Fig. 5e. Rs, Rsl and Rct represent the resistance of the electrolyte, electrolyte/surface layer interface, and charge transfer between surface layer and Si bulk, respectively. The Zsl and Z denote the element of diffusion process in surface layer and Si bulk, respectively. And Rsl, Rct, Zsl and Z are located in the high, medium, low-medium and low frequency regions respectively. With the proposed classified frequency range, the values of Rsl, Rct, Rsld (impedance of Liþ diffusion in surface layer) and Rd (impedance of Liþ diffusion in Si bulk) are calculated from γ(τ) (details in supporting information), as represented in Figs. S5b and S8. Although the values of Rsl, Rct and Rsld are larger in Si@CS electrode than those in bare Si electrode, the Liþ diffusion impedance in Si particles (Rd) decreases remarkably after 20 cycles (Fig. S8c), giving rise to a much lower and more stable total impedance for the Si@CS electrode (Fig. S8d), which could explain its better rate capability observed in Fig. 1n. The superior Liþ diffusion rate in Si bulk is attributed to the more ordered Si structure in cycled Si@CS electrode. The superiority of a Si electrode should also be determined by the total impedance in the whole electrode rather than the local impedance at particular interface. The Liþ diffusivity in Si bulk plays an important role in optimizing the performance of the Si electrode. Previous research [42] has shown that stress relaxation occurs in LixSi gradually, and would further be retarded with the stress applied by the distorted chitosan layer. After a few cycles activation, the Si atoms rearrange to form a nano-range ordered Si structure with lower Liþ diffusion impedance, which is more favored for lithiation reaction. Once the volume of the particles expanded after cycling, the chitosan layer can enable a compressive stress on Si and help to improve the Liþ diffusivity in Si bulk [43]. More significantly, the resistance of each process in Si@CS electrode (Figs. S5 and S8) is more stable than in bare Si electrode, indicating that the chitosan layer ensures a more stable and reversible structure for Si@CS electrode. The time constant of charge transfer process at surface layer/Si-interface τct and diffusion in the surface layer τsld are shown in Fig. S9. It is clear that great variations are observed in τct and τsld for bare Si electrode during the initial 200 cycles. It is caused by continuously growth of SEI film. Even if the SEI layer in bare Si electrode tends to be stable after 100 cycles, it shows a much higher τsld compared to Si@CS electrode, indicating a complex multi-phase property in the natural SEI layer. Whereas for Si@CS\nelectrode, both τct and τsld are stable and lower after 20 cycles, demonstrating a more stable and homogeneous interface exists in Si@CS electrode.\nThe equivalent capacitance of the corresponding processes are presented in Fig. S10. The capacitance of bare Si decreases gradually with a big capacity loss and tends to be stable after 150 cycles. The large initial Csld in bare Si electrode should be caused by the electrolyte penetration in the cracked SEI layer. After 100 cycles, the Csld decreases as the gradually thickened SEI layer could withstand the Si volume change and rebel the electrolyte penetration to lower the dielectric constant. Much lower and more stable Csld is observed in Si@CS electrode, suggesting that electrolyte penetration is blocked by uniform chitosan layer, which is confirmed by TEM images in Fig. 2l. All the evidences come to the conclusion that the chitosan layer is stable and dense, solid state reaction happens at the chitosan/Si-interface in the Si@CS electrode. The low Cct in Si@CS electrode (Fig. S10a) indicates fewer Liþ accumulation in the chitosan layer near the Si particle surface waiting for transfer. Moreover, the lithiation process in cycled amorphous Si is a single-phase reaction largely depends on Liþ diffusivity [4], so lower Rd enables a more efficient lithiation in the amorphous Si bulk. More significantly, the chitosan layer provides a stable Liþ transfer interface in which more homogeneous and controllable distributed Liþ flux are injected into the bulk of Si particle, enabling a more homogeneous lithiation process.\nThe CV curves of different scan rates in both electrodes are displayed in Figs. S12a–b. The peak current is linearly related to the square root of scan rate for both electrodes (Figs. S12c–d), showing a diffusion rate controlled feature of the electrochemical processes in both electrodes [44]. Therefore, the Rsld and Rd can be adjusted to largely improve the reaction efficiency. The stable and uniform Liþ flux controlled by the chitosan layer enables homogeneous lithiation process in Si bulk, which induces a more relaxed and uniform LixSi structure, establishing a lower energy barrier for Si atoms to migrate and rearrange. As a result, the delithiated Si forms a more ordered structure, which decreases the total impedance of the electrode and improves the stability of the Si@CS electrode."

      "text" : "The lithiation and delithiation processes of both electrodes are illustrated in Fig. 6. The bare Si electrode forms loose structured a-Si with various open pores due to the inhomogeneous interface, allowing electrolyte to penetrate into Si bulk (Fig. 6c), which induces pulverization and blurred SEI/Si-interface (Fig. 6d). As explained in the work of Zhu et al. [45], the initial lithiation of Si is self-limiting due to the increased stress at the LixSi/Si reaction front line, which results in a larger Liþ concentration at the surface of the Si particles (Fig. 6j), it is also supported by the previous work of Tzu-Liang Chan et al. [46]. The natural SEI layer provides inhomogeneous Liþ flux to access the SEI/Si-interface due to the unevenly distributed complex components with different Liþ diffusion rate. It will cause lithiation differential in the surface region of Si bulk, forming an inhomogeneous loose and highly expanded LixSi structure with irregular morphology, and finally results in a largely disordered arrangement of a-Si after delithiation. In comparison, the chitosan layer acts as a Liþ ion regulator, the Liþ ion diffusion in this layer is isotropous as its intrinsic single-phase property, which is different from the natural multi-component SEI layer [7–9]. The evenly distributed O and N containing groups on the chitosan chains de-solvates and accepts Liþ ions from electrolyte (Fig. 6e), offers a stable and homogeneous Liþ flux to guarantee the homogeneous nucleation of the LixSi phase. Additionally, with the confinement and compressive stress of chitosan layer, the structure of LixSi shell is compact, thus accelerates the reaction front line migration. This process further reduces the Liþ concentration in the surface region of the LixSi shell (Fig. 6l), resulting in a more homogeneous and compact LixSi phase with more uniformly dispersed Si atoms (Fig. 6f). During delithiation, the pressure\nL. Li et al.\nNano Energy 72 (2020) 104651\nand shrinkage of chitosan layer offer Si atoms more energy to migrate, and help to form nano-crystal Si clusters (Fig. 6i). The stress decreases gradually with the increasing amount of extracted Liþ ions. When the stress is no longer able to support Si atoms in LixSi to overcome the crystallization activation energy barrier, amorphous Si is formed (Fig. 6g). After multiple cycles, the delithiated chitosan passivated a-Si can adjust its structure to be favorable for repeated Liþ ion insertion and extraction (Fig. 6h), which finally leads to a more stable and reversible structure. The work of Choi et al. [47] showed that 5 nm thick Si sheets could maintain crystal property after Liþ insertion and extraction cycles, indicating that the formation of a-Si in lithi-/delithiation process is due to the low migration distance of the Si atoms during delithiation process. Although crystal Si is more thermodynamically favorable, the kinetic energy barrier prevents the formation of crystalline structure. The chitosan layer provides the energy to overcome the energy barrier. Moreover, the steady and homogeneous Liþ flux provided by the chitosan layer forms a more compact and uniform LixSi during lithiation, finally forming some nano-scale ordered crystal clusters in the a-Si at the early stage of delithation. A stable and lithiophilic interface layer on the Si surface leads to a different lithation/delithiation activity in the Si bulk."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusion",
      "text" : "We have proposed a strategy of modifying the Si/electrolyte interface by a uniform and lithiophilic chitosan nano-layer. It is found that the chitosan layer not only prevents the particle pulverization and repeated destruction of SEI film, but also provides a homogeneous Liþ diffusion pathway. Accordingly, when the mass ratio of coated chitosan to Si reaches 5:100, the Si@CS electrode maintains a high capacity retention of 96.7% after 100 cycles at a current density of 400 mA g 1.\nEven at a higher 1 A g 1, the capacity retains 91% after 400 cycles. Owing to a large and constant amount of active oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the chitosan that can coordinate with Liþ, this chitosan layer de-solvates and regulates Li-ion flux approaching to the silicon and hence stabilizes the interface between electrolyte and the silicon surface, enables a more homogeneous lithiation process in Si bulk. Interestingly, after 100 cycles, the local structure of silicon in the Si@CS electrode is more ordered than that in bare Si electrode. This phenomenon is believed to be caused by the stable and homogeneous Liþ flux and compressive stress provided by chitosan layer. The nano-scale ordered structure suppresses the volume change of Si particles during cycling and presents a superior Liþ diffusion kinetics compared to the bare Si particle. Our finding reveals that the interface engineering strategy of Si anode is a promising and economical way to develop high-performance Si-based anode materials for next-generation high-energy lithium-ion batteries. The proposed strategy that forming a uniform Li-ion flux diffusion from the interface to the bulk by introducing the lithiophilic layer onto the material surface is also applicable for developing other high-capacity alloy metal electrode materials.\nNotes\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\nL.

Natural SEI layer has a heterogeneous structure, results in the inhomogeneous Li diffusion. The repeated destruction and regeneration of SEI aggravate the inhomogeneity of Li diffusion at the interface, leading to non-uniform alloy reaction in the Si bulk. In this work, the silicon surface is passivated by an ultrathin uniform chitosan layer with abundant lithiophilic groups. The capacity of chitosancoated Si (Si@CS) could reach 1500 mAh g 1 at a current density of 1 A g 1, and the capacity retention remains 91% after 400 cycles. It is demonstrated that the oxygen and nitrogen atoms in chitosan are coordinated with Li, providing uniformly distributed Li transfer sites, results in a homogeneous Li flux in the surface layer. Interestingly, a nano-scale ordered atomic arrangement is observed in the delithiated Si@CS, which contributes to more stable and reversible lithiation/delithiation reaction of the Si@CS electrode. It is proposed that optimizing the reaction interface on the Si surface is able to alter the Li-ion diffusion kinetics and structure transition behavior of silicon, which can improve the structure reversibility and stability during cycling.",
