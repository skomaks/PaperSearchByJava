CNMs are inevitably released into the environment during production, transportation, and use, which raises questions about the ecological safety and health risks of CNMs. Recently, environmentalists and researchers have suggested exploring the possibility that\neywords: arbon nanomaterial icrobe egradation\nmicrobial biodegradation technology could be a reliable and efficient method for the removal of CNMs from the environment, because several types of microbes have been found to successfully degrade CNMs. However, we do not agree with this opinion at this point because this technology is immature, and is still very much at the experimental stage. Most importantly, environmental CNMs are highly stable, where the carbon is often difficult to extract and use by microbes.\n© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

There have been a number of studies emonstrating the ability of microbes to decompose CNMs [7–9]. icrobes can degrade carbon nanomaterials, mainly because they an produce CNM-degrading enzymes, such as Manganese perxidase (MnP) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium [9] and lignin eroxidase (LiP) from Sparassis latifolia [8]. Taking multi-walled NTs (MWCNTs) biodegradation by bacteria as an example, the egradation pathway is that MWCNTs are first decomposed into everal intermediate products such as isophthalic acid, 2-methoxy aphthalene, cinnamaldehyde and 2-naphthol, and finally are ransformed into CO2 [10]. Recently, the biodegradation of CNMs y microbes has been reviewed, showing that both fungi and baceria can degrade carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene (GRA), and heir derivatives [11,12]. Known fungi for CNM biodegradation nclude Sparassis latifolia [8], Phanerochaete chrysosporium [9], and rametes versicolor with naturally occurring microbial communities rom aerated wastewater treatment plant sludge or field-collected ediment [13], while Trabusiella guamensis [14], naphthalene-\n∗ Corresponding author.

These fungi and bacteria can utilize CNMs as a carbon source, which leads to the degradation of CNMs. As a result, many researchers believed that microbial degradation could be a promising approach to environmentally eliminating CNMs. Moreover, most researchers considered microbial degradation as a better method to remove pollutants than traditional physicochemical methods because microbial degradation is a ‘green’ technology and avoids secondary pollution.\nCNMs as a “terrible” carbon source for microbes\nEnvironmentalists brought the findings about the microbial degradability of CNMs to light because of concerns about the risks of these materials in the environment [15]. Unfortunately, however, it is too premature to remove CNMs by microbes in practical applications at present. This is, in part, because CNMs are not a good carbon source for microbes (Fig. 1), although they are rich in carbon. For example, MWCNTs cannot be used as the sole carbon source to enrich CNM-degrading microbes [10]. Additional carbon sources such as glucose are often needed, which triggers the degradation of CNMs via co-metabolism. Previous studies on the microbial degradation of CNMs were mainly carried out under lab conditions [11]. Field conditions are largely different from those of lab. There are\nv u a i t r < d c fi t n C u\nI\nr m m e d o c t C a e o t w C t a\n[\n[ [\nccessible carbon sources (delicious carbon sources), rather than CNMs. Dotted elli NMs indicates that only a minor part of CNMs have been utilized by microbes.\narious carbon sources available for microbes in addition to CNMs nder field conditions. Microbes generally prefer to utilize more ccessible foods, rather than CNMs, because the carbon from CNMs s highly stable. In fact, despite claims by studies under lab condiions, CNMs show very low degradation rates by microbes under eal environmental conditions. For example, it was reported that 0.1% single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) were mineralized to carbon ioxide by T. versicolor together with naturally occurring microbial ommunities from aerated wastewater treatment plant sludge or eld-collected sediment [13]. Moreover, the growth and reproducion of microbes are related to the conditions in their particular atural environment. Strong adaptability of the microbes to the NM-containing environment is helpful to their survival by the tilization of CNMs.\nmplications\nThe widespread applications of CNMs in numerous areas require emoval strategies after they are disposed of in the natural environent because CNMs have been found to present toxic effects on any types of organisms. Although the current CNMs-degrading fficiency of microbes is low, but the ability of microbes to egrade CNMs can be improved by further studies. The methds to improve this ability include the development of a mixed ulture consisting of multiple microbes at a reasonable ratio, he findings of new microorganisms or enzymes with very high NMs-degrading potential, the adding of defects on the CNMs nd modification to make them more reactive, the control of nvironmental conditions such as pH and temperature, and so n. Thus, microbial biodegradation technology could be a potenial candidate for remediation of the environment contaminated\nith CNMs when various constrains such as weak ability to use NMs as carbon source, dependence on the environmental condiions and limited number of known CNM-degrading microbes are ddressed. Thus, we still have a long way to go to utilize microbial\n[\n[\n[\nows that the carbon sources have been consumed, while the small blank circle on\ndegradation technology for cleaning up CNMs from the environment.\nNotes\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest.\nAcknowledgments\nThe study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51508177,51521006), and the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (IRT-13R17).\nReferences\n[1] M.
