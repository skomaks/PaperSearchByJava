      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "With the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization, excess pollutants are discharged into the environment. It will undermine the ecological environment and even threatens human health and welfare [1,2]. On account of the toxicity persistence, bioavailability, and biological accumulation of pollutants, the risk of unfavorable effects of human health will increase when individuals are exposed continuously in a high concentration [3].\nA number of literatures have reported the methods of removing pollutants from the environment, including redox process [4–6], chemical precipitation [4], photocatalytic degradation [7,8], ion-exchange [9–11], reverse osmosis [12,13], adsorption [14–18], filtration [19–21], and electrochemical process [22,23]. Adsorption is a low-cost, high-efficiency and eco-friend method for environmental remediation. It has been used extensively in removing organic and inorganic pollutants from aqueous solution [24–27]. Adsorption material is the key factor in the adsorption process. So far, researchers focus on the application of carbon based materials [16], biochar [28,29], nano-sized metal oxides [30], clay minerals [31], and inorganic metal sulfides [32–34] to separate pollutants from environment. Some of the above materials, such as nano-sized metal oxides and inorganic metal sulfides, not only can adsorb the pollutants, but also have redox properties to remove redox-sensitive pollutants.\nIron sulfide (FeS) or mackinawite, one of the iron sulfides minerals, is a precursor to other more stable phases with a tetragonal structure that each iron atom is in tetragon coordination to four sulfurs [35,36]. The history of the application of FeS in soil and water remediation can be traced back to the 1990s [37,38]. The Fig. 1 provides an overview of the milestones on advance and application for environmental remediation used by FeS which has a high reactivity to numerous chemical substances. It has been confirmed that an iron sulphide material produced by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) has excellent adsorbent properties to some specific heavy metals such as mercury, cadmium, and copper. FeS contains high oxidation state iron site and reduction state sulfide site, so the chemisorption plays a leading role in whole adsorption process [39]. Meanwhile, FeS, as an effective reducing\nagent, can degrade halogenated hydrocarbon pollutants and remove variable valency metals from contaminated soil and water since Fe2+ and S2− species will act as electron donor [40]. Especially, FeS can be utilized for degrade the chlorinated hydrocarbons pollutants, including chloroethylene, hexachloroethane, trichloroethylene [41], and carbon tetrachloride [42]. For the removal of heavy metals, FeS also shows an excellent performance, especially on the reduction of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] to trivalent chromium [Cr(III)] which is much less toxic and has a strong affinity for particles [43].\nSince the emergence and rapid evolution of nanotechnology, more and more researchers have shifted their attention to the exploitation and application of nanomaterials. Nanomaterials are defined as the size of particles contained in materials measured between 1.0 and 100 nm at least one dimension [44]. Over the past decade, nanotechnology has been gradually used in remediation of contaminated surface water, groundwater, soil, and sediment. These are because of the high reactivity and large surface-to-volume ratio [45–47]. Nano-sized FeS can not only treat the redox-sensitive contaminants via reductive degradation, but also remove pollutants by chemical adsorption on account of the higher reactivity and the larger specific surface area than macroparticles [48]. Accordingly, nano-sized FeS shows more commendable potentials to reduce the heavy metal ions and organic contaminants compared to the macroparticles.\nThe purpose of this paper is to focus on the synthesis technique of nano-sized FeS particles, potential applications, and immobilization mechanisms in the remediation of contaminated soil and water. The objectives of this review are to (1) summarize the synthesis methods for the bare and modified FeS nanoparticles, (2) summarize the applications in decontamination of halogenated hydrocarbon pollutants, radionuclides, heavy metal ions, and toxic metalloids from soil and water, (3) exposit the interaction mechanisms between contaminants and FeS nanoparticles, (4) conclude the influence factors of contaminants uptake by FeS nanoparticles, and (5) propose the knowledge gaps and the future research expected."

      "heading" : "2.1. Synthesis of the naked nano-sized FeS",
      "text" : "Previous researches have reported some synthesis methods for FeS nanostructured materials, and the ordinary synthesis methods for naked nano-sized FeS particles are generally divided into two categories: physicochemical methods [49] and biological methods [39]. The traditional synthesis method for naked nano-scale FeS is chemical precipitation. It means the FeS nanoparticles could be synthesized by coprecipitation of Fe2+ and S2− in the aqueous phase with continuous stirring under anaerobic conditions [50]. Under the most circumstance, ferrous chloride (FeCl2) [51], iron sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4⋅7H2O) [52], and ammonium ferrous sulfate [(NH4)9SO4·FeSO4·6H2O] [53] were regarded as the source of Fe2+, meanwhile sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O) was used to provide S2−. Using FeCl2·H2O aqueous solutions and Na2S·9H2O aqueous solutions could synthesize the nanoparticulate FeS in situ in an anaerobic chamber [54], and the FeS shown a superior adsorption capacity for arsenate [As(V)] and arsenite [As (III)]. Apart from the traditional chemical precipitation method, another physical synthesis technique of bare nano-structured FeS powder is mechanical milling. Soori et al. [55] used the starting materials FeS2 and Fe to prepare the FeS nanocrystals by high energy ball milling, and the mechano-chemical reactions as follows:\n+FeS Fe 2FeS2 (1)\n+Fe S FeS (2)\nOn the other side, biosynthesis of FeS nanoparticles has also caught researchers’ attention for its “green” and environmental-friendly process. In general, ferric reducing bacteria (FRB) and sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) are utilized to reduce Fe3+ and sulfur species (including sulfate, thiosulfate, and elemental sulfur) into S2− and Fe2+ respectively to generate FeS nanoparticles [56–58]. Zhou et al [57] novelly synthesized nano-scale FeS by Acidiphilium cryputum JF-5 and Desulfovibrio vlugaris miyazaki SRB, and diffraction peaks of the black nanoparticles matched those of mackinawite (FeS0.9) according to X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 2). The reducing process of Fe3+ can be described as reaction (3) [59]:\n+ + + ++ +C H O 24Fe 24OH 6CO 24Fe 18H O6 12 6 3 2 2 2 (3)\nAdditionally, Shewanella species are frequently used in producing biogenic nano-sized FeS as well. Shewanella species can simultaneously reduce ferric iron and sulfur species such as thiosulfate which are the terminal electron acceptors when the lactate was used as the electron\ndonor commonly [48,60]. For instance, Fe3+ and thiosulfate could be biological reduced by the Shewanella putrefaciens CN32 to generate mackinawite that can reduce U(VI) to UO2 from aqueous [60]. The mechanism and processes of biosynthesis and abiotic reduction are exhibited in Fig. 3 that biological reduction of Fe3+ and thiosulfate would form aqueous Fe2+ and S2− so as to produce mackinawite. Xiao et al. [61] illustrated that FeS nanoparticles can be produced during the biodegraded of naphthol green B (NGB) by Shewanella species. The Fe2+ released from NGB and the H2S generated from thiosulfate reduced by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 could generate FeS nanoparticles with an average size of ∼30 nm."

      "heading" : "2.2. Synthesis of the modified nano-sized FeS",
      "text" : "FeS nanoparticles synthesized through traditional methods tend to not only agglomerate rapidly to macroparticles due to interparticle interactions (mainly van der Waals interactions), but also oxidize easily to decrease the reactivity [52]. Naked FeS nanoparticles with a lower chemical reactivity are difficult to disperse in contaminated soil and water, which restrict their large scale application in environmental remediation [62]. To overcome these obstacles, the modification of bare nano-sized FeS, such as attaching a stabilizer [62–64] or loading a supported materials [45,65] showed in Fig. 4 has been emerged so as to improve their mobility and efficiency in removing pollutants. The summaries of modified nano-scale FeS produced from different type of chemicals and methods are presented in Table 1.\nSome researchers have been carried out to coat stabilizers such as polymers and surfactants on the surface of bare FeS nanoparticles to limit their aggregation via providing the extra steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion, which can not only reduce the aggregation of nanostructured materials but also provide a great deal of functional groups to decontaminate pollutants [66]. In light of the existence of numerous carboxyls and hydroxyls on the macromolecular chain, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), a polyelectrolyte stabilizer, is widely applied to modify nanoparticles so as to enhance the stable and deliverable property of nano-sized FeS [52,62,67,68]. The CMC-FeS nanoparticles could be synthesized by adding FeSO4 solution to certain concentrations CMC solution to form the CMC-Fe2+ complexes, then adding Na2S solution (Fe:S molar ratio of 1:1) dropwise under the protection of N2. Under the most circumstance, the CMC-FeS nanoparticles were more stable that could suspend at least 24 h, while bare FeS nanoparticles aggregated and precipitated after only several minutes [52,67]. In addition to the CMC, other macromolecular biomaterials with similar physicochemical property such as starch, cyclodextrin (CD), and polysaccharide sodium alginate (SA) have also arisen great attention [63,64,69,70]. Wu et al. [64] utilized SA as a stabilizer coated on the surface of nano-FeS so as to prevent the growth and aggregation of nanoparticles. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were shown as Fig. 5 (A and B). It revealed that nanoparticles were dispersed homogeneously by SA and the size of SA-FeS was approximately 100 nm in diameter. In addition to CMC and SA, other biomaterials like CD, starch, glucose, beef extract, gelatin, peptone, and yeast extract could modify FeS nanoparticles and enrich U(VI) from aqueous solution [66]. It has been found that gelatin-FeS can be effectively dispersed in aqueous solutions. It was owing to the electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged gelatin-FeS nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the polymeric chain of gelatin could also disperse FeS nanoparticles. Taking advantage of the greater viscosities of gelatin-FeS, the stability of nanoparticles was enhanced via slowing down the Brownian motion as well.\nDifferent from coating macromolecular stabilizers on the surface of FeS nanoparticles, the physicochemical loading methods not only can disperse nanoparticles but also form more suitably-sized particles compared to biomaterial stabilization so as to improving the sequestration of contaminants [71,72]. Taking advantage of the physicochemical properties and performance on long-lasting and dispersing of\nporosint, porous materials are introduced to support and disperse nanoparticles [73]. Biochar is a carbon-rich, porous solid with many oxygen functional groups and aromatic surface, which is obtained from biomass via various thermochemical processes with little or no oxygen [74]. It has been demonstrated that biochar supported nano-composites shows highly potential to remove contaminants in environment due to the feature of biochar that environmental friendliness, easy raw materials getting, low-cost, and favorable physicochemical surface characteristics. Lyu et al. [75] prepare a novel biochar supported FeS nanoparticles composite (CMC-FeS@biochar) with lager specific surface area and smaller hydrodynamic diameter (253 ± 3 nm) compared to bare FeS (7420 ± 296 nm), which can remove Cr(VI) up to 130.5 mg/g higher than bare FeS (38.6 mg/g) and biochar (25.4 mg/g) respectively.\nExcept for porous carbon materials, non-carbon materials like limestone and aluminum oxide also possess the porous structure and high stability that could offer more sites to combine FeS nanoparticles. Moreover, the strong moisture adsorption characteristic of limestone and aluminum oxide could also create a dry surrounding so as to prevent inactivation and oxidation of FeS then prolong service life of composite nanomaterials [45,72]. The FeS/supporting materials could be prepared by both biosynthesis and abiotic synthesis. Liu et al. [45] used the biologically-formed nano-sized FeS-coated limestone synthesized by ironreducing bacterium Acidiphilium cryputum JF-5 and sulfate reducing bacterium to remove As(V) from contaminated water. Sun et al. [72] synthesized Al2O3-supported nanoscale FeS to immobilize mercury(II) in aqueous and the adsorption capacity was calculated about 891 mg/g,\nTa bl e 1 Su m m ar\ny of\nsy nt\nhe si\ns m\net ho\nds of\nm od\nifi ed\nFe S\nna no\npa rt\nic le\ns fr\nom di\nffe re\nnt ty\npe of\nm od\nifi er\n.\nM od\nifi er\nPr op\ner tie\ns of\nm od\nifi er\nSt ru\nct ur\ne of\nm od\nifi er\nSy nt\nhe tic\nm et\nho d\nCo m\nbi na\ntio n\nm od\ne Re\nf\nCa rb\nox ym\net hy l ce llu lo se (C M C)\nBi od\neg ra\nda bl\ne, hi\ngh ly\nst ab le an d so ilde liv er ab le .

      "text" : "Currently, FeS nanoparticles exhibit the tremendous potential and flourishing application in environmental remediation illustrated in Fig. 6. However, bare FeS nanoparticles show limitations on a large scale application due to the high agglomeration and oxidizability [67]. In light of these limitations, some modifiers are used to disperse the FeS nanoparticles to overcome these shortcomings [45,62,65]. Hence, the utilization of modified nano-sized FeS has been regarded as a potential technology which could improve the physicochemical properties of naked nano-sized FeS and then increase the remediation efficiency by adsorption and oxidoreduction reactions. It is a promising and prosperous option to remove the halogenated hydrocarbon pollutants, radionuclides, heavy metal ions, and toxic metalloids from water and\nsoil, which is discussed as follow."

      "heading" : "3.1. Halogenated hydrocarbon contaminants",
      "text" : "Halogenated hydrocarbons are widely found in the soil and water along with the large amount of wastewater discharged from industrial activities, which threaten the human health and ecological security [76]. FeS nanoparticles have been obtained extensive environmental applications in degradation of halogenated hydrocarbons, mainly including chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) and bromo-hydrocarbon [41,51,77,78]. CHCs, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), perchloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), dichloroethane (DCE), vinyl chloride (VC), and hexachloroethane (HCA) have been widely used as a raw materials in many industries like polymer materials, chemical, medicine, and pesticide [42]. The contamination of chlorinated hydrocarbons in soil and water arouses the worldwide concern in consideration of their properties of bioaccumulation, persistence, carcinogenicity, and toxicity which would cause the destruction of ecological balance and influence the normal growth of life body [79]. Various technologies have been focused on the dechlorination of CHCs such as bioremediation, redox process, permeable reactive barriers (PRBs), and photocatalytic degradation [80–82]. Among many technologies\ntested so far, abiotic dechlorination using Fe(II)-bearing minerals as reactive reductants to dechlorinate CHCs, like HCA and 4-chloronitrobenzene, appears to be an approving technique, especially using mackinawite (FeS) [83]. Taking advantage of the high density of reactive chemical species on the surface, mackinawite shows a strong reduction ability to dechlorinate CHCs from soil and water. It has been discovered that the HCA could be dechlorinated reductively by FeS (poorly crystalline mackinawite) relatively rapidly, and the process was highly pH-dependent and easily affected by coexisting organic matter. The products analysis revealed that HCA degraded into PCE principally, and the subsequent reaction products included TCE, cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cis-1,2-DCE), and acetylene [41].\nIn addition, it is noteworthy that reductive dechlorination of CHCs by nano-sized FeS may be faster than that by macro-sized FeS owing to the larger specific surface area. Hence, utilizing the FeS nanoparticles to degrade CHCs abiotically is a promising technology during the process of dechlorination reactions. Huo et al. [48] made use of Shewanella putrefaciens CN32 to generate biogenic FeS nanoparticles to improve the dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride (CT). The pasteurized biogenic FeS nanoparticles exhibited a high reactivity with the 5-fold higher CT dechlorination rate than the abiotic FeS which was shown in Fig. 7.\nHowever, not all the FeS nanoparticles exhibit a superb dehalogenation effect. Hyun et al. [84] confirmed that freshly prepared nanosized mackinawite could significant transform cis-DCE to acetylene while freeze-dried mackinawite had virtually no reactivity to cis-DCE. It might be due to aggregation formation or the reactivity of nano-sized mackinawite suspensions was lost during the rinsing and freeze-drying process. In order to overcome the aggregation and inactivation of nanoparticles, the study of modified FeS nanoparticles on dechlorination have increasingly captured the attention of scientists in recent years. It has been found that FeS nanoparticles stabilized by fungal polymer which produced from a basidiomycetous fungus, Itajahia sp. could catalyze a rapid reductive dehalogenation reaction of lindane (γ-hexachlorocyclohexane) (5 mg/L) with an efficiency of 94% in 8 h, while the non-stabilized FeS could degrade merely 25% lindane in the same period [70]. It is confirmed that stabilized FeS nanoparticles can provide a much more effective degradation on CHCs compared with bare nanoparticles.\nExcept for utilize nano-scale FeS particles individually to degrade CHCs, some studies have found the reductive dechlorination would be improved via nano-scale FeS with cyanocobalamin [Cbl(III)] together. The presence of Cbl(III) could improve the dechlorination efficiency of PCE significantly, and the main degrade mechanisms were the\nhydrogenolysis and β-elimination [79,85,86]. Amir et al. [86] demonstrated that PCE could fully degrade at pH 8.3 within 120 h by FeS nanoparticles with Cbl(III), and the dechlorination kinetic rate constant was 145 times greater than that without Cbl(III). During this process, the higher pH could lead to a better dechlorination performance. Kim et al. [85] found that almost 95% of PCE was degraded at pH 12 within 20 h with the presence of Cbl(III), while the remove rate was merely 25% of PCE without Cbl(III). The product analysis of PCE reductive dechlorination identified that acetylene and TCE were the main dechlorination products, and the dechlorination pathway was shown in Fig. 8.\nApart from chlorinated hydrocarbon organic compounds mentioned above, bromo-hydrocarbons are non-negligible contaminants in the natural environment as well. Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are usually discovered in soil and water on account of their comprehensive usage and improper disposal [87,88]. Li et al. [78] reported that FeS particles could transform 90% hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) within 48 h in a water/ethanol (98/2, v/v) solution. The possible pathway for dibromo-elimination was forming 1,5,9-cyclododecatriene and both Fe2+ and S2− on the FeS surface were oxidized during the reduction of debromination of HBCD according to the XPS analyses."

      "text" : "As the continuous evolution of nuclear science and technology during the past decades, a growing number of radioactive wastewater and solid wastes generated from mine field or nuclear power plants are discharged into the natural environment, and then resulted in water and soil contamination with radionuclides [89]. Some long-lived radioactive elements, such as uranium (U), neptunium (Np), plutonium (Pu), technetium (Tc), and rhenium (Re) are the common radioactive contaminants owing to their highly mobility, toxicity, and radioactivity which severely endangers the human health and life safety [90]. Redox state of radionuclide elements affects their toxicity, bioavailability, and solubility for valence-variable element like U, Tc, and Re. The U(VI), Tc (VII), and Re(VII) species in the higher oxidation states show very high\nsolubility compare to their reduction states. Under the most circumstances, ion exchange, co-precipitation, and sedimentation technologies were applied for radionuclide removal from soil and water. However, FeS nanoparticles are desired to immobilize radionuclide pollutants via the process of adsorption and redox reaction to low solubility products [90].\nIn general, existential forms of U in aqueous are uranyl [U(VI)] or carbonate complex, which are high soluble and toxic. The nanocrystalline mackinawite (FeS) could provide a good immobilization capacity, which not only could reduce U(VI) to U(IV) and restrain the reoxidation of U(IV) but also adsorb U(VI) and generate the mixture species of U(IV)/U(VI) to the surface of mackinawite [66,91]. Hyun et al. [92] covered that U(VI) could be eliminated almost complete at the initial concentration of 5 × 10−5 M via redox reactions. The elemental sulfur was formed with the coprecipitation of UO2. Beyond that, the sulfides could also be oxidized to sulfate (SO42−) ions [60]. However, the aggregation of bare FeS nanoparticles restricts their application. In consequence, modified nano-sized FeS obtained many attentions. The FeS/Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles stabilized by poly (acrylamide) (PAAM) was found have more enrichment capacity of U (VI) compared with Fe3O4 and PAAM-Fe3O4. The maximum enrichment capacity of U(VI) on PAAM-FeS/Fe3O4 was calculated to be 311 mg/g by the Langmuir model, while on Fe3O4 and PAAM-Fe3O4 were 90 mg/g and 121 mg/g respectively [93]. Meanwhile, it can be separated from aqueous solution by magnetic separation method due to the content of Fe3O4.\nTechnetium-99 (Tc-99) is another radioactive element with long half-life (t1/2 = 2.13 × 105 years) and redox-sensitive in radioactive waste. The prevailing redox states of Tc are Tc(VII) and Tc(IV), and pertechnetate (TcO4−) in aqueous shows higher solubility than other form over the entire pH, while the Tc(IV) is stable under reducing conditions and exists as precipitate oppositely [94]. Taking advantage of the difference of solubility with Tc(VII) and Tc(IV), contaminants could be eliminated via FeS nanoparticles owing to the property of oxidoreduction and high specific surface area to adsorb and coprecipitate. Liu et al. [95] used amorphous FeS nanoparticles with the surface area measured as 66.96 m2/g to immobilize TcO4− from aqueous solution. Results indicated that the product generated from the reaction of TcO4− and FeS was principally TcO2. About 60% immobilization yield could keep stable under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions at neutral pH and the reductive capacity of the FeS was calculated as 867 mg/g in long term stability studies. Wharton et al. [96] covered that pertechnetate (TcO4−) and perrhenate (ReO4−) could be reduced on coprecipitation with mackinawite via formed TcS2-like cluster and Re–S–Fe species respectively."

      "heading" : "3.3. Heavy metals",
      "text" : "Considering the non-biodegradable, toxic, and persistent, heavy metals are difficult to remove from environment and accumulate easily in food chain so as to cause discomfort of living organisms and even threaten the human health [1]. Hence, it is urgent to control the concentration of heavy metal ions effectively in environment for the sake of public safety. The common heavy metal contaminants include chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), and nickel (Ni). FeS nanoparticles have been portrayed as a commendable reductant and adsorbent for eliminating heavy metal ions [39,58,69].\nChromium (Cr) is a redox-active metal and widely used in electroplating, metallurgy, and other industries. It is one of the common heavy metal pollutants in soil and water. Particularly, Cr(VI) and Cr(III) are two stable species in environmental medium. The toxicity, carcinogenicity, and solubleness of Cr(VI) are higher than Cr(III). Therefore, it is significant to convert the Cr(VI) to Cr(III) so as to improve the remediation efficiency of chromium-contaminated soil and water. Some studies have found that FeS nanoparticles could not only be used as an\nadsorbent, but also as a reducing agent to promote the removing of Cr (VI) from soil and water [38,97]. Comparing bare FeS nanoparticles, the modify nanoparticles obtained a higher removing efficiency [75,98]. The sodium alginate stabilized FeS nanoparticles (FeS-SA) could enhance the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) observably that from 65% (7.50 mmol/g) to 100% (11.54 mmol/g) compared to bare nanosized FeS. The XRD patterns revealed α-FeOOH, S8, and Cr(OH)3 were generated from Fe(II) and S(−II) oxidation and Cr(VI) reduction respectively [64]. Lyu et al. [98] illustrated that CMC-FeS@biochar nanoparticles had a higher Cr(VI) immobilization efficiency from Cr(VI) contaminated soil than biochar and bare FeS, and the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure-leachable (TCLP-leachable) Cr(VI) was decreased from 11.9 mg/L to 0.63 mg/L.\nAnalogously, mercury (Hg) is also a notorious heavy metal contaminant in water and soil. The contaminants of mercury are presented in natural environment mainly in the form of methylmercury (MeHg) and Hg(II) [67]. Hg(II) can transform to MeHg easily, which is more poisonous and can accumulate in food chain. Hence, removing the bioavailable Hg(II) is the committed step to control the concentration of mercury in soil and water [99]. Taking advantage to the presence of thiol functional group which is a soft Lewis base, sulfur-containing chemicals can be employed to scavenge mercury in that Hg(II) which is a soft Lew acid can bond with soft Lewis base preferentially [67]. Previous studies indicated that mackinawite (tetragonal FeS) can adsorb Hg(II) so as to limit the methylation of Hg(II) [53]. The Hg(II) sorption mechanisms are dependent on the molar ratio of initial concentration Hg(II)/FeS, which adsorption predominated the Hg(II) removal when the molar ratio as little as 0.05 and precipitation predominated when the molar ratio was increased [100]. Meanwhile, Hg (II) can also be reduced to Hg(0) and adsorbed by nanocrystalline mackinawite from aqueous suspension at circumneutral pH [101]. Recently, the modified FeS nanoparticles were found that not only can prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles but also increase the removal efficiency of mercury from soil and water. It has been confirmed that CMC stabilized FeS nanoparticles can promote the deliverability in environmental medium as well as increase the removal capacity of mercury by up to 20% at a light concentration of CMC [62]. Sun et al. [69] synthesize magnetic nanoscale FeS/Fe3O4 composites stabilized by chitosan (CTO-MFeS) and the adsorbing capacity of Hg(II) up to 97.86 mg/g after 120 min. This nanocomposites not only can be separated easily but also improve the adsorption efficiency on account of the presence of Fe3O4.\nBeyond that, other bivalent heavy metal contaminants such as Cd, Pb, Cu, and Ni can also be treated by FeS nanoparticles through adsorption and co-precipitation [39,102,103]. The maximum Ni removal was reported could be up to 6.4 mmol/g with 2.25 g/L nanocrystalline FeS, and Ni was removed from aqueous solution rapidly in the initial period (< 1h) then turned into slower from about 1–55 h [104]. On the other hand, Pb and Cd could be retained in mackinawite surface via ionexchange with Fe and result in the formation of (Pb,Fe)S and (Cd,Fe)S, which could adsorb the Pb and Cd ion by means of surface adsorption reactions, or the formation of separate metal sulfide phases PbS and CdS [105]. Hence, this puts forward commendable ideas for the removal of divalent heavy metal ions such as Pb, Cd, and Ni, that is, utilizing the performance of adsorption and ion exchange of nano-scale FeS to immobilize pollutants from soil and water. It has been confirmed that FeS nanoparticles stabilized by CMC possessed a high affinity for metal ions (Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and could remove these metal ions from contaminants soil and sediment [68]."

      "text" : "In the wake of the dramatic increase of industrial and agricultural activities, toxic metalloids such as arsenic (As), selenium (Se), and antimony (Sb) distributed and occurred naturally in minerals are released to environment. Contamination of soil and water with As has\ncome into notice by reason of the highly toxic and carcinogenic of arsenic. Arsenic exists mainly in arsenite [As(III)] and arsenate [As(V)] in the environment. Ordinarily, oxyanions of As(V) are stable under aerobic conditions whereas oxyanions of As(III) dominate under hypoxia or anaerobic conditions [54]. It was observed that FeS particles showed high removal efficiency to As(III) and As(V) from acidic mining drainage via formatting As2S3 precipitates between S(−II) and As(III), and As(V) could be reduced to As(III) then formed As2S3 [106]. Along with the advance of nanotechnology, nano-sized FeS are not simply regarded as reductants, but served as superior adsorbents compared to macroparticles for their smaller particle size, larger specific surface area and higher reactivity. FeS nanoparticles could help to immobilize As (III) and As(V) with the co-exist of phosphate (PO43−), and the removal efficiency of As(III) and As(V) was up to 87–98% [54]. Liu et al. [45] utilized iron-reducing bacterium Acidiphilium cryputum JF-5 and a sulfate reducing bacterium (SRB) to form nano-sized FeS coating on limestone to scavenge As(V) and the maximum adsorption is 187 μg/g higher than that for pristine limestone (6.64 μg/g).\nMoreover, as other kind of redox-sensitive metalloids contaminants, Sb can also be removed from polluted water and soil by nano-sized FeS via adsorption, redox reaction, and secondary precipitation [107]. The existential state of Sb are trivalent and pentavalent oxyanion in natural environment [108]. The limestone coated by nano-sized FeS has been confirmed have a commendable removal efficiency higher than pristine limestone at 35, 60, and 126 times for scavenging As(V), Sb(V), and Cr (VI) and the maximum adsorbing capacity reach to 14.9, 9.9, and 9.2 μg/g respectively [109].\nIn like manner, contamination of Se in water and soil is also a potential threat to ecological balance and human health in spite of it is an essential nutrient for life body, furthermore it can cause teratogenesis or carcinogenesis under the long term exposure at low concentrations of Se [49]. Selenite species [Se(IV)] and selenate species [Se(VI)] are the primary inorganic form of Se in aqueous environment, and the existing researches are focus on the adsorption of Se(IV) in view of the higher toxicity of Se(IV) than Se(VI) [110]. The mackinawite was reported that can serve as a favorable adsorbent to scavenge Se from aqueous solution. Han et al. [49] indicated that both Se(IV) and Se(VI) can adsorbed on mackinawite and the removal of Se(IV) was up to 127 μM within 120 min at pH 8, which was higher than Se(VI) that 10% was removed within 1 h, owing to the affinity of Se(VI) with FeS was lower than Se (IV)."

      "text" : "Adsorption technology is a common method for removing organic and inorganic pollutants from soil and water via the solid materials. Nano-sized FeS particles showed a higher specific surface area than the bulk particles so as to provide more active sites. Therefore, adsorption reaction is one of the main mechanisms for the removal of pollutants by FeS nanoparticles, especially for the divalent metal ion like Ni2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, and Pb2+ [68]. During the Hg2+ was removed by nanocrystalline mackinawite at the molar ratio of Hg2+/FeS < 0.05 (initial concentration), the adsorption was the main mechanism and would be saturated with the increase of molar ratio due to the generation of\nmetacinnabar (β-HgS) [100].Similarly, more than 99% Ni2+ could be removed from aqueous by nanocrystalline mackinawite[104]. Meanwhile, there were no generation of nickel monosulfide (α-NiS or millerite), polydymite (Ni3S4) or godlevskite [(Ni,Fe)9S8], greigite, and pyrite. It confirmed that the sorption of Ni2+ at the surface of nanocrystalline mackinawite was the primary mechanism.\nIn addition to bare FeS nanoparticles, the adsorption mechanism of modified nano-sized FeS has been reported in recent years [52]. The biosynthetic FeS nanoparticles loaded on limestone had a greater removal performance on As(V) than pristine limestone and the interaction was attributed to chemical adsorption, which was investigated by attenuated total reflection Fourier-transformation infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) [45]. Sun et al. [72] discovered that Hg element was equally, relatively densely distributed in dense parts of FeS when Al2O3supported nanoscale FeS was used to remove Hg2+. It had been illustrated that HgS was produced during removal process and the main removal mechanism was chemical adsorption on the basis of the XPS analysis.\nAccording to the nature of the intermolecular binding force between adsorbate and adsorbent, the adsorption can be divided into physisorption (physical forces) and chemisorption (chemical bonds). The adsorption of matter is carried out by various mechanisms on the solid–liquid surface, such as ion exchange, electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic bonding, hydrogen bond and surface adsorption (Van der Waals) force, etc. [111]. It is a remarkable fact that the adsorption mechanisms of FeS nanoparticles is composite under the most circumstances usually accompanied by one or several ways discussed as follow: (1) the surface adsorption between FeS nanoparticles and target contaminants, (2) the surface complexation between sulfhydryl functional groups on FeS and contaminants, (3) the chemical precipitation of target contaminants with FeS nanoparticles and (4) the ion-exchange reaction between target ion and FeS to form [Fe(1−x)Mx]S, where the M represent the divalent metal ion like Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ [50,62,69,72]. The particular interaction mechanisms are shown in Table 2. Sun et al. [63] reported that precipitation was one possible removal mechanism involved in the adsorption of Hg2+ on the biomaterial stabilized FeS nanoparticles because HgS characteristic peaks appeared in all Hg-laden stabilized FeS according to the XPS patterns. Additionally, surface complexation was also occurred during the adsorption process owing to the formation of mercuric complexes [namely ≡FeS–Hg(II)] detected by the XRD characteristic peaks at 2θ = 31.4°. Excepted for the surface complexation and precipitation, ion exchange was another reported mechanism for Hg removal The XRD spectra of characteristic peaks indicated that the product of the reaction between Hg(II) and FeS nanoparticles were metacinnabar HgS, cinnabar HgS, and (Hg0.89Fe0.11)S, which showed the possible mechanism includes chemical precipitation and ion exchange[62]."

      "heading" : "4.2. Redox reaction",
      "text" : "Generally speaking, the redox reaction is another important mechanism for organic and inorganic contaminants removes from soil and water, especially for the redox-sensitive contaminants including As, Cr, U, Tc, Re, and halogenated organic matters [64,84,112]. In normal conditions, the solubility, toxicity, and carcinogenicity of Cr, U, Re, and Tc are higher under the high valence states than the lower valence states [64,91,96]. FeS is effective for the reduction of these contaminants owing to it can provide a source of Fe2+ and S2−, both of which can donate the electrons to contaminants and act as the reducing agents to reduce the pollutants [64]. Generally, FeS could partially dissolve to form Fe(II) and S(−II), and then undergoes oxidation by redox-sensitive contaminants. In the meantime, the redox-sensitive contaminants are reduced to low solubility and toxicity chemicals after they obtain electrons [64,75]. Zhou et al. [109] reported that the maximum adsorption capacity of As was 517 µg/g calculated by the Langmuir isotherm adsorption model, and As(V) could be reduced to\nthe As(III)-O, As(0), and As(II)-S by nano-FeS-coated limestone according to the analysis of the XPS 3d spectra. Liu et al. [106] illustrated that FeS particles provide available Fe(II) and S(−II) for As removal, and the dominant reactions between FeS and As(III) or As(V) were shown as Fig. 10.\nIt is noteworthy that the redox reaction is not a single process that also accompanied by other processes in most cases [66]. The reaction mechanism for the removal of contaminants could be brief summarized as the follow steps [64,66,75]: (1) chemical sorption of contaminants on the surface of nano-sized FeS, (2) partial dissolution of FeS so as to provide Fe2+ and S2− and reduce the contaminants from high valence states to lower valence states, (3) formation of complex between low valence states ions Mn+ and Fe2+ through ion exchange and surface complexation, (4) chemical precipitation of the sulfide M2Sn and oxide M2On. For example, when U(VI) was immobilized by the CMC-FeS nanoparticles and gelatin-FeS nanoparticles, the reaction mechanism were found consist two step. First, U(VI) adsorbed to the surface of FeS nanoparticles and Fe2+ released from FeS in the meantime. Second, U (VI) reduced by Fe2+ and S2− to form U3O8/U4O9/UO2 on FeS surfaces [66]. Wu et al. [64] reported that the removal mechanism of Cr(VI) by sodium alginate stabilized FeS nanoparticles (SA-FeS) including reduction and adsorption. According to the characterized of SA-FeS nanoparticles that XPS and TEM-EDX (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Transmission electron microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray), 82% Cr(VI) removal by the reduction of Fe2+ and S2−, and 18% Cr(VI) could be adsorbed by the products (e.g., α-FeOOH). Meanwhile, Lyu et al. [98] demonstrated that oxygen-containing functional groups such as CeO, C]O, and eOH provided by CMC-FeS@biochar could also\naccelerate the immobilization of Cr(VI) through (1) surface adsorption via surface pores and oxygen-containing functional groups, (2) reduction of Cr(VI) by Fe(II) and S(−II), and (3) formation of Cr2O3, Cr (OH)3, Fe2O3, and Fe(OH)3 by chemical precipitation.\nFor the halogenated hydrocarbon contaminants, reductive dehalogenation is the most important mechanism to degrade pollutants from water and soil. FeS nanoparticles could be regarded as a desired reductant to degrade the halogenated hydrocarbon contaminants, such as CT, TCE, PCE, HCA and so on, via reductive dehalogenation due to Fe2+ and S2− could act as electron donors for reductive decontamination reactions [41,70]. Huo et al. [48] reported that biogenic FeS nanoparticles exhibited a superior dechlorination performance to degrade CT then form chloroform (CF). The dechlorination activity was conducted by (1) the high content of Fe(II) and S(−II) to donate electron, and (2) the well-dispersed structure of biogenic FeS nanoparticles, which could also be the effective electron shuttle to the mediate bioreduction reactions. He et al. [113] investigated that TCE could be degraded rapidly by non-freeze-dried FeS nanoparticles and the major product was acetylene. The pathway of reductive dechlorination of TCE was β-elimination that additional carbon–carbon bond generated with loss of two vicinal halogens. The other products were cis-DCE, ethane, and methane, which means the hydrogenolysis might be another mechanism via hydrogen substitute halogen. Furthermore, the cis-DCE was found could be degraded by nano-sized FeS via β-elimination process that acetylene was the only detectable degradation product, which could avoid to form the toxic byproduct like vinyl chloride [84]:\n+ +cis DCE 2e acetylene 2Cl (27)"

It is necessary to evaluate the relationship\nbetween remediation conditions and decontamination efficiency so as to understand the interaction mechanism preferably and provide an optimum condition for environmental remediation.\nAmong these parameters, pH could be the most significant influencing factor in the remediation of contaminants by nano-sized FeS. Under most circumstances, pH could not only affect the properties of nanomaterials but also determine the existent forms of ions. The adsorption capacity was proved to decrease significantly in strong alkaline or strong acidic condition, which not only destroy the surface active sites then accelerate the corrosion of FeS nanoparticles, but also promote the hydrolysis of bio-modifiers then undermine the stability and dispersibility of modified nano-scale FeS [63,69,75]. Furthermore, under the strong alkaline condition, precipitation of iron hydroxides could decrease the Fe(II) in the aqueous and generate the passivation layer on the surface FeS [63,64]. It has been proved that the removal capacity of FeS-SA to Cr(VI) would increase from 92.51% to 99.65% at pH 4 to 6 and sharply decreased to 65.37% at pH 10. Meanwhile, at high pH values, there was competition for absorption between negatively charged hydroxyl ions and negatively charged ions (CrO42−). [64]. Therefore, the neutral condition could provide the optimal uptake of pollutants.\nOwing to the competitive relationship between the target contaminants and coexisting matters combined with FeS nanoparticles, it is necessary to\nTable 2 Reactions of various contaminants with FeS nanoparticles.\nTarget contaminants\nMechanisms Reactions Ref\nHg(II) Precipitation, ion exchange, surface complexation and surface adsorption.

The effects of chloridion (Cl−) and coexisting cations concentration on immobilization capacity of nano-sized FeS were tested. The Cl− could hinder Hg(II) sorption owing to form the HgeCl complexes [HgClx2−x (x = 1, 2, 3, 4)], which have a low affinity to nano-sized FeS [62,69]. Wu et al. [64] also found that high concentration of CaCl2 could cause high ionic strength and then enhance electrostatic repulsion between dichromate ions and adsorbent. However, there are still some publications mentioned that there was no obvious effect of Cl− concentration on contaminants removal capacity and the probable reasons could be: (1) the increase of Cl− could enhance the ionic strength, accelerate the charge transfer and shorten the equilibrium distance between the surface of nanosized FeS and contaminants, (2) with the increasing of Cl− concentration, more S(−II) were exposed to precipitate with contaminants due to the corrosion of FeS nanoparticles [63,66,72]. Therefore, the effect of Cl− concentration may be not always same under the different situations. It needs to be taken into consideration to attain optimal results in different applications. Meanwhile, the concentration of coexisting cations such as Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+ might also influence the immobilization process. It has been reported that the presence of Ca2+ could restrain the removal of Cr(VI) by SA-FeS nanoparticles owing to the positive charged Ca2+ was easily accessible to negative charged adsorbent and competed with dichromate ions to combine with the active sites [64]. Unlike removal of Cr(VI), Sun et al. [63] found that Ca2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+ had no distinct influence on removing Hg(II) owing to Ca2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+ were difficult to despoil S2− from Hg(II) (lgKspHgS < lgKspCuS < lgKspCdS < lgKspPbS < lgKspFeS, where Ksp represent solubility product).\nGenerally, contact time between FeS nanoparticles and contaminants can affect the removal efficiency during the redox and adsorption process. The interactive effects between FeS nanoparticles and contaminants could be described by pseudo-first-order kinetics and pseudo-second-order kinetics usually [114]. Under the most circumstances, the removal efficiency could decline dramatically in the initial time, and then slowed down till equilibrium. Lyu et al. [75] found that Cr(VI) could be removed fast by CMC-FeS@biochar within the first 5 min and then slowed down till equilibrium at ∼ 24 h. The pseudosecond-order kinetic model with the highest R2 (≥0.999) provided better fitting than the pseudo-first-order model (R2 varied from 0.313 to 0.903). Some researches demonstrated that Hg(II) could be adsorbed by both non-stabilized FeS and stabilized FeS nanoparticles rapidly in the initial about 120 min then decreased slowly, till reached equilibrium in about 7 h. The kinetics model could be described by pseudo-secondorder model, which revealed that chemisorption is the rate-limiting step in the Hg(II) adsorption [62,63,69].\nIn addition, dosage of modifiers is another significant influencing factor, and choosing an optimum dosage of modifiers can achieve the desired removal efficiency with a cost-effective modified materials. The optimum modifiers dosage usually can be determined by experiments. Gong et al. [62] illustrated that 100% of particles were suspended when the CMC concentration up to 0.03 wt% or higher and 0.03 wt% was regarded as optimum stabilization concentration. The removal efficiency of Cr(VI) by SA-FeS nanoparticles would increase from 65.38% to 99.65% when the percentages of SA increased from 0 to 0.08%, then slightly decreased with further increase of the SA concentration [64]. Hence, it is necessary to choose an optimum modifiers dosage during the removing process rather than utilize a large consumption of modifiers due to an excessive modifiers might inhibit the access of contaminants to the surface sites on nanoparticles."

      "text" : "In the past few decades, a growing number of publications are keeping a watchful eye on the application of FeS materials to solve the contamination in water and soil. Taking into consideration of the unique properties of nanomaterials that with a higher reactivity and larger\nspecific surface area compared to the macroparticles counterpart, the researches’ attention is gradually diverted into the utilization of nanosized FeS in environmental remediation. In this review, we summarize the recent studies on the synthesis technology of bare and modified FeS nanoparticles, the application of nano-sized FeS on the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants, and the mechanisms between nanoscale FeS and target pollutants including surface adsorption, redox reaction, ion exchange, coprecipitation, surface complexation, and dechloridation. Meanwhile, the effect of remediation conditions also discusses in this review including pH values and coexisting matters. Although the FeS nanoparticles have been widely used in pollutants removing from water and soil, there are still some knowledge gaps and challenges in the application of nano-sized FeS, which are proposed as follows:\n(1) Although the modification of FeS nanoparticles has largely improved the stability and mobility so as to inhibit the aggregation each other, the distance of transportation is still a limiting factor in the application of nano-sized FeS to decontaminate polluted water and soil effectively [98]. Hence it is necessary to further modify the stabilization technique so as to improve the migration of nanoparticles, especially in the contaminated soil. (2) The long-term stability and inoxidizability of modified FeS nanoparticles could further be studied in the subsequent research. FeS nanoparticles could be oxidized easily in the presence of oxygen. If the FeS nanoparticles are not stable in a long time and then lose reaction activity, the removal effect of contaminants will be affected, and then the practical applications in soil and water remediation could be limited seriously. Therefore it is important to maintain the stability and enhance the resistance to oxidation of nanoparticles in the process of remediation so that the technology effectiveness could be ensured. (3) An increasing number of researches have been pay attention to the nano-sized FeS in environmental remediation. However, the information of toxic effect of FeS nanoparticles was limited. It has been found that nucleic acids could bind FeS nanoparticles and then restrain the interaction with other nucleic acids or amino acids [115]. Zheng et al. [116] illustrated that exposure to CMC-FeS nanoparticles could significant damage DNA and protein due to the nanoparticle induced oxidative stress. Therefore it is important to fully investigate the potential environmental safety when the FeS nanoparticles are released in soil and water. (4) It is necessary to conduct the further research of FeS nanoparticles in the removal of pollutants from soil. Only a few literatures reported the soil remediation utilized FeS nanoparticles [68,98]. Therefore, utilizing the reduction and adsorption of FeS nanoparticles is a desired way to remove pollutants in soil. (5) The soil properties influenced by FeS nanoparticles should be taken into consideration. Only Lyu et al. [98] illustrated the influence of CMC-FeS@biochar amendments on soil physical–chemical properties such as total organic carbon (TOC) and redox potential of contaminated soil. Owing to the addition of nanomaterials, the physicochemical properties of soil could be changed and the function of soil might be affected. In consequence, it is important to carry out the subsequent research along with the application of FeS nanoparticles in soil remediation. (6) There is needed to understand further the fate of FeS nanoparticles after inject into the soil and water, especially under the field conditions. Detailedly and comprehensively researching the environmental fate of FeS nanoparticles could provide a more safe application in the repair process."
