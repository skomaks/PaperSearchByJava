      "text" : "Soil pollution involves the contamination of soil by various anthropogenic (agricultural, industrial, wastewater) activities which involve the addition of nutrients, pesticides, and sediments to soil, and on the other hand, industry and urbanization pollute the soil with solid wastes, heavy metals, solvents, and several other slow degrading organic and inorganic substances [1]. The pollution includes point sources, such as emission, effluents, and solid discharge from industries, vehicle exhaustion, and metals from smelting and mining, and nonpoint sources, such as soluble salts (natural and artificial), use of insecticides/pesticides, disposal of industrial and municipal wastes in agriculture, and excessive use of fertilizers [2–5]. Dispersal of waste from its source can be through the atmosphere, via the water bodies and water channels, or directly into the soil itself, and from there it enters the food chain and adversely affects the human life directly or indirectly [6]. Metals, like copper, iron, manganese, and zinc, are essential for life processes, whereas others, like cadmium, nickel, and mercury, have no physiological function but often result in harmful disorders at a higher concentration [7]. High heavy metal ingestion such as cadmium, chromium, mercury, and lead can cause renal and lung dysfunction, bone degeneration, liver damage, etc. in human and animal health [7–9].

Singh School of Environment and Sustainable Development, Central University of Gujarat, Gandhinagar, India\n384\nadsorption, precipitation, and transformations of chemical substances; and a biological filter by decomposing organic materials, it does not have infinite capacity to perform these functions [10]. Unlike air pollution which has a direct impact on human lives, soil pollution causes an indirect damage to humans and other animals. Any addition of a substance that may exert adverse effect on its functioning can be defined as soil contamination and those substances known as contaminants or pollutants. Phytoremediation has now emerged as a promising strategy for in situ removal of many contaminants [11]. Microbe-assisted phytoremediation including rhizoremediation appears to be particularly effective for removal and/or degradation of organic contaminants from impacted soils, particularly when used in conjunction with appropriate agronomic management and cultivation techniques [12]. Phytoremediation is widely viewed as the ecologically responsible alternative to the environmentally destructive physical and chemical remediation methods currently practiced. Significant progress has been made in recent years in developing native or genetically modified plants for the remediation of environmental contaminants. Phytoremediation has been defined as the use of plants directly or indirectly to degrade or remove contaminants from soil and water [13]. It is an emerging technology that utilizes plants and their associated rhizosphere microorganisms to remove and transform the toxic chemicals located in soils, sediments, groundwater, surface water, and even the atmosphere. Phytoremediation is an effective, nonintrusive, and inexpensive means of remediating soils [14].\nNanotechnology is a broad-based field of study focused on materials and applications occurring at a very small scale. In general, most people accept that nanotechnology deals with structures that are less than 100 nanometers (nm) and involves developing materials or devices within that size [15]. Nanoparticles exhibit a number of special properties relative to bulk material and often have unique visible properties because they are small enough to confine their electrons and produce quantum effects [9]. These are unique chemical and physical properties; hence they received much attention by the researchers working in many fields of science such as allotropic forms of carbon, fillers, and efficient gas adsorbents for environmental remediation and as support medium for different inorganic and organic catalysts [16]. Nanoparticles can be broadly grouped into two: namely, organic and inorganic nanoparticles. Organic nanoparticles may include carbon nanoparticles (fullerenes) or be produced from the dead organic matter such as orange peel, potato peel, etc., while some of the inorganic nanoparticles may include magnetic nanoparticles, noble metal nanoparticles (like gold and silver), and semiconductor nanoparticles (like titanium dioxide and zinc oxide). According to Ruffini-Castiglione and Cremonini [17], there were identified three types of NPs (nanoparticles): natural (e.g., volcanic or lunar dust, mineral composites), incidental (resulting from anthropogenic activity, e.g., diesel exhaust, coal combustion, welding fumes), and engineered. The last type of NPs belongs also to metal-based materials—quantum dots, nanogold, nanozinc, nanoaluminium, TiO2, ZnO, and Al2O3 [18]. Environmental applications of nanoparticles such as cleanup of pollutants from air, water and soil have been done by various approaches. Cleanup process of pollutants is mainly known as remediation. If biological agents are involved in the process to degrade\nA. Srivastav et al.\n385\nthe pollutants in less/nontoxic forms, it is known as bioremediation and if living plants are involved in the remediation process, that is known as phytoremediation. Nano-phytoremediation is a technique which involves nanotechnology and phytotechnology for the remediation of environmental pollutants. Nano-phytoremediation for degradation and removal of TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene)-contaminated soil is more effective than either nanoremediation or phytoremediation. Use of nanoparticles for environmental applications is increasing very rapidly. This is due to the large surface area of the particles as compared to bulk-size particles; therefore its reactivity is greatly enhanced for the chemical- or biological-mediated reactions for environmental applications [19]. Application of nanomaterials for remediation is rapidly progressing in the research field. Nanomaterials have the potential to absorb/ adsorb or reduce the contaminants from the environment. Iron-based nanoparticles are widely used nanoparticles for the remediation process. For example, nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) has been used to reduce the environmental contaminants such as cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (c-DCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and trichloroethylene (TCE) (https://clu-in.org/download/remed/nano-fact-sheet-2011. pdf). Recent researches focused on improving the efficiency of the nanomaterials, and in addition the researchers also focus on understanding the processes by which the nanomaterials have been taken up and transported to check of any toxicological effects on the system. Conventional remediation techniques involve disposal on landfills or immobilization of the contaminated soils. This technique is very costly, while phytoremediation techniques are cheaper. NPs tend to adsorb the pollutants due to large surface area. NPs adhere to the roots and translocated to the harvestable part of the plants which are used for the phytoremediation.\nThis chapter includes the nanotechnology-based phytoremediation process to reduce the contaminants from the environment."

It is the direct use of living green plants, waste of the fruit/vegetable, etc. for in situ removal or degradation of contaminants in soils, sludge sediments, surface water, and groundwater. It is allowing cost- and solar energy-driven cleanup technique. It is a cost-effective technique for remediation process which involves the plants to metabolize the molecules in the tissues and to degrade the elements from the environment. It is the natural ability of plants to accumulate, degrade, or concentrate the contaminants from soil, water, and air. Pollutants and toxic metals are the major goal for the phytoremediation. In recent studies, physiological and molecular mechanisms of phytoremediation are designed to improve the phytoremediation process for environmental cleanup.

It has been suggested that fastergrowing floras like grass species are effective plants for phytoremediation of PAHs in contaminated soils [20–22]. Trees like poplar (Populus spp.) or willow (Salix spp.), with extensive root systems and high transpiration rates, hold particular promise for phytoremediation [23]. The action of plants on these compounds is multifarious: they can be immobilized, stored, volatilized, and transformed into various extents (even mineralized) or a combination of them, depending on the specific compound, environmental conditions, and plant genotypes involved. The mechanisms used by plants to facilitate remediation include phytoextraction, phytodegradation, phytostabilization, phytovolatilization, and rhizodegradation.

By choosing and maintaining an appropriate cover of plant species, coupled with appropriate soil amendments, it may be possible to stabilize certain contaminants (particularly metals) in the soil [34] and reduce the interaction of these contaminants with associated biota.\n16 Nano-phytoremediation of Pollutants from Contaminated Soil Environment…\n388"

It is the natural ability of a plant to volatilize a contaminant that has been taken up through its roots which can be exploited as a natural air-stripping pump system. Volatile pollutants diffuse from the plant into the atmosphere through open stomata in leaves where gas exchange occurs. Additionally, processes such as plant uptake and phytovolatilization, contaminant accumulation, and metabolic transformation may be relevant for some plants and organic chemicals [31]. Direct volatilization and phytovolatilization are expected to be moderate for hydrophilic compounds such as acetone [36] and phenol [37]. In contrast, volatilization may be an important removal process for volatile hydrophobic compounds such as lower chlorinated benzenes ([38]), chlorinated ethenes [39, 40], and BTEX compounds [41]."

      "heading" : "16.2.1.5 Rhizodegradation",
      "text" : "Rhizodegradation is a biological treatment of a contaminant by enhanced bacterial and fungal activity in the rhizosphere of certain vascular plants. The rhizosphere is a zone of increased microbial density and activity at the root/surface and was described originally for legumes by Lorenz Hiltner in 1904. Plants and microorganisms often have symbiotic relationships making the root zone or rhizosphere an area of very active microbial activity [42–46]. Plants have several miles of roots per acre, suggesting the potential of pollutant degradation in the rhizosphere. Sugars, organic acids, and larger organic compounds which constitute about 10–50% of plant’s photosynthate are deposited in soils [47]. Rhizoremediation, an integral component of phytoremediation, can occur naturally or can be triggered by introducing specific pollutant-degrading microbes or plant growth-promoting microorganisms [48]."

NBR is the new emerging technique for the removal of pollutants for environmental cleanup. Current technologies for remediation of contaminated sites are chemical and physical remediation, incineration, and bioremediation having their own advantage and disadvantage. With recent advancements, bioremediation offers an environmentally friendly and economically feasible option to remove contaminants from the environment [49]. Earlier researches were focused upon the metal accumulation in the plants in search of hyperaccumulators; after that the concept of using the plants for remediation process has been developed. Many researchers investigated other plantcontaminant interactions, rhizosphere degradation, and uptake of metals. The\nA. Srivastav et al.\n389\nprogression of research led to full-scale phytoremediation process to various contaminated sites (Joel G. [50]). Nowadays air pollution is the major and complex problem which directly affects the human health. Development of phytotechnologies for removing the pollutants from the environment to improve the air quality is highly required for quality life. Recent researches focused on mechanism by which plants may inhibit the airborne pollutants from the environment. Due to anthropogenic activities, concentration of elements and its compounds is continuously increasing in soils. Manual analysis and eradication of all the soil contaminants are very expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is very important to know the soil-contaminant interaction to prevent the uptake of contaminants from the soil to plant [51]."

Nanomaterials are widely used nowadays in the field of cosmetics, paint, medicines, textiles, etc. Nanotechnology increases phytoremediation efficiency, and nanoparticles can also be used for remediation of soils and water which are contaminated with heavy metal, organic, and inorganic pollutants. Recent studies have shown that organic contaminants such as atrazine, molinate, and chlorpyrifos can be degraded with nanosized zerovalent irons. Nanoparticles in enzyme-based bioremediation can also be used in combination with phytoremediation [9, 52]. Many nanomaterials have been developed for the environmental application. Nanomaterials are useful for the remediation process because of their large surface area, hence these materials are more reactive than their bulk form, and they can easily penetrate the contaminated sites [53]. Use of nanomaterials for the environmental cleanup is progressing rapidly. Iron nanomaterials are most widely used for the remediation process (https://clu-in.org/download/ remed/nano-fact-sheet-2011.pdf). Some researchers investigated that nanomaterials decontaminated the organic pollutants (PCBs, PAHs, PPCPs, and organic solvents) in the soil [54]. According to Jiamjitrpanich et al. [55], a combination of nanotechnology and phytotechnology for TNT remediation from soil is more effective than the soil without nanomaterials.\n16.3.1 Factors Affecting the Nano-phytoremediation of Contaminant\nThe factors affecting chemical uptake and distribution within living plants include:\n1.

The integration of phytoremediation and application of nanoparticles comprise an important step in the progress of soil decontamination. Numerous studies have demonstrated that various nanoparticles/nanomaterials significantly detoxify or remediate the organic, inorganic, and heavy metal pollutants in soils.

Nano  TiO2 (nTiO2) degrade the  organic pollutants (diuron, p,p′-DDT, pyrene, phenanthrene) in soil and reduce the half lives of pyrene and phenanthrene [59], through redox reaction, photocatalysis, and thermal destruction under irradiation [60]. Recent study also performed the significant degradation of residues of the pesticide atrazine [2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine] through PEI-copper nanoparticles deposited onto montmorillonite and sand [61]. The indirect impact on the soil microorganisms may partially explain some mixed positive and negative results on the plants caused by NPs applied to the soil. Positive responses of soil bacteria have been reported in some cases, as was the case when 1 or 10 mg kg−1 of NPs of FeO were applied to the soil, although the application of NPs of Ag (0.1–10 mg kg−1) had a negative effect [62]. Nano-phytoremediation application has a wide range in terms of soil contaminants removal. Contaminants ranging from heavy metals to volatile organic compounds can be easily treated by this technology with high efficiency of its uptake by the plant. Nanomaterial-assisted phytoremediation is particularly effective for organic pollutants and more efficient removal of site contaminants. Recent studies have reported that the application of nanoparticles can also improve the stress tolerance of plants in ex situ and in situ conditions thereby promoting phytoremediation potential [63–65]."

Size is the major factor of the nanoparticle to penetrate inside the plants and translocate from roots to other parts of the plants. Nanomaterials penetration process is also a factor to determine how efficiently plant takes up the nanomaterials [66]. After entering in the plant roots, there are two ways to move inside the plant tissues. Apoplastic transport; this type of transport takes place outside the plasma membrane, xylem vessels [67]. The other is symplastic transport; it involves the movement of water between the cytoplasm and sieve plates [68]. Uptake is affected by the environmental conditions [69]. The temperature affects growth substances and consequently roots length. Root structure under field conditions differs from that under greenhouse condition.

The pollution includes point sources, such as emission, effluents, and solid discharge from industries, vehicle exhaustion, and metals from smelting and mining, and nonpoint sources, such as soluble salts (natural and artificial), use of insecticides/pesticides, disposal of industrial and municipal wastes in agriculture, and excessive use of fertilizers [2–5]. Dispersal of waste from its source can be through the atmosphere, via the water bodies and water channels, or directly into the soil itself, and from there it enters the food chain and adversely affects the human life directly or indirectly [6]. Metals, like copper, iron, manganese, and zinc, are essential for life processes, whereas others, like cadmium, nickel, and mercury, have no physiological function but often result in harmful disorders at a higher concentration [7]. High heavy metal ingestion such as cadmium, chromium, mercury, and lead can cause renal and lung dysfunction, bone degeneration, liver damage, etc. in human and animal health [7–9].
