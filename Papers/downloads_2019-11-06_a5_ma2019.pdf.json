The effects of influential aspects including; location of heat source/sink, number of tubes, Rayleigh number ( Ra ), volume concentration ( \uD835\uDF19) and type of the nanoadditives on the isotherms, streamline, stream function and average Nusselt number ( \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 ) are explored. The governing equations are solved numerically employing control-volume based finite volume technique. For pressure-velocity coupling, the Semi-Implicit Method is utilized. According to the obtained results, usage of nano-fluid leads to the considerable enhancement of heat transfer in the studied cavity. For all the examined configurations with two cylinders, the configuration 30° has the most \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 values which is followed by configurations 60° or 0°, 90°, 120°, 150° and 180°, respectively. It is clearly seen that for all the assessed configurations with three cylinders, the highest to lowest \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 respectively belongs to the Case 2C, Case 2A and Case 2B. Moreover, for all the investigated configurations with four cylinders, the highest and lowest \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 respectively occurs at Case 3B and Case 3A.\n1\nfl c e t c\na o H c c a t\nC\nk fl t t\nS t a i a t fl w h t e\nh R A 0\n. Introduction\nBuoyancy-induced convection phenomenon in enclosures filled with uid plays an important role in some of industry and engineering appliation such as nuclear reactor design, electronics cooling, heat exchangrs and thermal energy storage systems [1–4] . Also in recent decades, he convection heat transfer between horizontal cylinders is taken into onsideration more than ever.\nDesigners are often reluctant to utilize mechanical equipment to crete fluid flow, especially when a small power consumption, a negligible perating noise, and a high reliability of the system, are main concerns. owever, the inherently poor energy efficiency of natural and mixed onvection, in comparison with equivalent or similar forced convection ases, represents a substantial restriction to heat transfer. As well the cceptance of the conventional techniques which are used to enhance he heat transfer according to the usage of turbulators is a imaginable\n∗ Corresponding author at: Laboratory of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials, Adv ity, Vietnam.\nE-mail address: masoud.afrand@tdtu.edu.vn (M.

Therefore, an inclusive sympathetic of he thermal behavior of these systems is vital.\nKuehn and Goldstein [5] were the first to work on this topic. adripour conducted several investigations [6,7] on the naturally venilated horizontal coaxial annuli and examined the impact of various spects such as Ra, Pr and aspect ratio. In their empirical investigation, t was realized that laminar to turbulent flow regime transition happens t Ra = 10 6 . Kumar [8] investigated free convective flow in a horizonal annuli geometry where the inner cylinder is under a constant heat ux (hot wall) and the outer cylinder has a constant temperature (cold all). Ho et al. [9] studied numerically the natural/mixed convection eat transfer in two horizontal cylindrical annuli (coaxial and eccenric). They found that the hydrothermal aspects of the flow depend on ccentricity of the annulus and the Ra .

Desai and Vafai\n11] studied numerically 2D and 3D turbulent free convective flow in orizontal annulus. The finite volume method was used for their nuerical modeling of the turbulent fluid flow. They realized that for sufciently long annulus, it is possible to simulate approximately the free onvective flow in horizontal annulus by a 2D model. Also they realized hat usage of radial fins on inner cylinder has a significant influence n heat transfer in annulus. Existence of such fins makes the flow and eat transfer characteristics substantially different from those of annuus without fins. This flow geometry has been investigated for laminar ow case by Chai and Patankar [12] , Sheikhzadeh et al. [13] and Arbaan and Salimpour [14] . Chai and Patankar [12] investigated the fluid ow and heat transfer characteristics for a horizontal annulus equipped ith six radial fins. They found that the internal fins orientation has not ny significant influence on the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 . It is while the fluid flow, tempera-\n\uD835\uDC56\nure field and heat transfer rate are sharply affected by fins properties. heikhzadeh et al. [13] studied numerically the nano-fluid flow and heat ransfer characteristics for two different cases with two and four fins. hey realized that the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 rises by growing the Ra and \uD835\uDF19. Also they ound that the fins length and the number of fins have an important inuence on \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 and the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 reduces with growing of length and number f fins. Arbaban and Salimpour [14] studied numerically the hydrotheral aspects of nano-fluid flowing inside a coaxial annuls with internally nned inner cylinder and using three different nano-fluids. They realzed that the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 intensifies by boosting of \uD835\uDF19. Also they observed that he temperature gradient and absolute value of stream function reduces n case of using nano-fluid instead of base fluid. Rahnama and Farhadi 15] studied numerically the free convective flow of turbulent fluid flow egime between two horizontal coaxial cylinders equipped with radial ns. They realized that at the same Ra the heat transfer rate reduces by oosting of fins number.\nIn a numerical assessment, Gap et al. [16] examined the free conective flow in a square cavity with circular cylinders. It was reported hat growing the Ra causes an intensification in the heat transfer rate. ark et al. [17] studied numerically laminar free convective flow in an nclined square cavity with inner circular cylinder. They realized that he averaged Nusselt number reduces along the top and left walls by oosting of cavity tilted angel. It is while the averaged Nusselt number nhances along the bottom and right wall by boosting of cavity tilted ngel. Wang et al. [18] and Dai et al. [19] in similar studies investigated aminar free convective flow in a 2D horizontal square cavity with two ylinders having different temperatures. It was found that the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 is a unction of tube arrangement. Khanafer et al. [20] studied numerically ixed convection heat transfer in a lid driven enclosure with inner cirular cylinder. They found that the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 enhances with intensify of cyliner radius for all the studied Richardson numbers. Öztop et al. [21] and minossadati et al. [22] studied mixed convection heat transfer probem in a two-sided lid-driven enclosure. At low Richardson numbers, the \uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 changed sharply with moving walls direction changing. Park et al. 23] investigated numerically free convective heat transfer in a square nclosure with 4 inner circular cylinders. It was reported that the variaion in isotherm and streamline patterns varies drastically with distance etween enclosure walls and hot cylinders. Al-Zamily et al. [24] studed numerically the nano-fluid flow and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) ree convective flow in a semi-circular cavity. They observed that the eat transfer rate enhances by boosting of the Ra and the \uD835\uDF19. Hedayti et al. [25,26] conducted simulations to assess the mixed convection ow of nano-fluid through a vertical microchannel. The outcomes reealed that replacing the heat sources with smaller ones results in the nhancement of heat transfer. In a numerical assessment, Kefayati [27– 1] analyzed the mixed convection flow of nano-fluid in a differentially eated cavity and reported the Nusselt number enhancement by growng the \uD835\uDF19. Kalteh et al. [32] investigated numerically different nanoaditive diameter effects on mixed convection heat transfer inside a lid riven square enclosure. They found that at all Richardson numbers the eat transfer rate reduces by growing the nanoadditives diameter. Malandi et al. [33–36] studied numerically nano-fluid flow and natural and ixed convection heat transfer inside two different cavities (vertical and orizontal) under magnetic field effects. They found that in attendance f a magnetic field, the decline of heat transfer diminishes especially at igh nanoadditives diameters. Moradi et al. [37] investigated numerially fluid flow and free convective flow of Newtonian nano-fluids in an solated cylindrical cavity. They realized that the heat transfer rate enances with intensify of the enclosure aspect ratio. Selimefendigil et al. 38,39] investigated numerically nano-fluid flow and the MHD mixed onvection heat transfer in a lid-driven cavity equipped with a rotatng circular cylinder. In the attendance of a magnetic field, the velocity eld and convection heat transfer within the cavity were underdevelped. Also, it was reported that the heat transfer rate intensifies with rowing the \uD835\uDF19. Sheikholeslami et al.

They presented that the heat transfer rate enhances by oosting of Ra and \uD835\uDF19. But it reduces with the growth of Hartmann numer. Ho et al.

Garoosi et al. [48] investigated numerically fluid flow and natural nd mixed convection heat transfer in a square cavity with 2, 3 and hot and cold cylinders. They realized that the heat transfer rate enancement or reduction depends on the rotation direction of the hot and old cylinders. Also, they observed that the heat transfer rate enhances harply by changing the hot tubes location from top to bottom.\nGouidmi et al. [49] studied numerically upward vertical two-phase ow through an annulus coaxial pipe. The condition of two-phase flow as simulated with the volume of fluid model and turbulence effects ere simulated by employing the k- \uD835\uDF00 model. Earn et al.

In another study Sheremet and Pop [57] analyzed nuerically free convection in a horizontal cylindrical annulus filled with porous medium saturated by a nano-fluid using Tiwari and Das’nanouid model. Bondareva et al. [58] studied heatline visualization of free onvection in a thick walled open cavity filled with a nano-fluid. Also, ondareva et al. [59] investigated entropy generation due to free conection of a nano-fluid in a partially open triangular cavity.\nThe literature review elucidates that although the free convective ow in a space between two horizontal adiabatic coaxial cylinders hich filled with nano-fluids has been assessed, but, to the best of au-\nhor’s knowledge there is not any study which investigates the free conective flow between several differentially hot and cold tubes enclosed n a space between two horizontal adiabatic coaxial cylinders which lled with nano-fluid. The main aim of the present work is to investiate numerically the free convective flow between several differentially ot and cold tubes enclosed in a space between two horizontal adiaatic coaxial cylinders which filled with three different kinds of nanouids. The impacts of influential aspects including; location of the heat ource/sink, number of tubes, Ra , \uD835\uDF19 and nano-fluid type on the pattern f isotherms, streamlines, stream function and \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 are explored.\n. Problem definition\nThe free convective flow between several differentially heated tubes nclosed in a space between two horizontal adiabatic coaxial cylinders s investigated in the present work. Fig. 1 indicates a schematic diagram f differentially heated annulus that the present work has been validated y it.\nFig. 2 shows the geometries used in the present study. A polar cordinate system is adopted in such a way that the radial coordinate r s measured from the center and the angular coordinate \uD835\uDF03 is measured ounter-clockwise from the downward vertical symmetric line, along hich direction gravity acts. The hot and cold tubes are kept at constant emperatures and they are T h = 305 K, and T c = 295 K, respectively. It s while the cylinders surfaces are insulated. The reference temperature s T ref = ( T h + T c )/2 and it has been chosen as the average value of hot nd cold tubes. The following assumptions are predicted:\n• The nano-fluid is incompressible and the flow regime is laminar. • The nano-fluid is treated as single-phase fluid.\n• The base fluids and nanoadditive are in thermal equilibrium and no slip condition takes place between them. • The thermophysical properties of the nano-fluid are considered to be constant with the exception of density which differs according to the Boussinesq approximation.\n.

Code validation and mesh independence test\nDue the lack of experimental data for free convection in an annuus, the numerical procedure is validated by the experimental results of uehn and Goldstein [5] for Ra L = 2.09 • 10 5 , Pr = 5.45, ΔT = 0.371K, avg = 303.18K and L /2 ri = 0.8 providing T i > T o (see Fig. 1 ). The comarisons for six temperature profiles at six different angles, (angle meaured from the lower symmetry plane), are indicated in Fig. 3 . Numercal test related to the dependence of the results on the mesh spacing ave been performed methodically. A grid testing is undertaken for two ifferentially heated tubes at horizontal position ( \uD835\uDF03 = 90°) enclosed in a pace between two horizontal adiabatic coaxial cylinders filled with waer that the value of \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC61 is reported for temperature difference of tubes T = T h − T c = 10K, r o / r i = 2.5, R tubes / r i = 0.2 and H / L = 0.5. Seven nonniform nodes are engaged for the numerical procedure and the results re indicated in Table 2 . It is obvious that from the results, the grid with 0,319 nodes is fine to certify a grid independent solution adequately. ig. 3 b shows demonstration of grid mesh layout.\n. Results and discussion\n.1. Models with two tubes\nIn this section, usage of different nano-fluids (Cu-Water, Cu-EG and u-Water/EG) is investigated in space between two adiabatic horizontal oaxial cylinders equipped with two hot and cold tubes in different anles. Fig. 4 shows streamlines inside the cavity filled with pure fluid and queous Cu nano-fluid with \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 at different Ra (10 3 < Ra < 10 5 ) or Cases 1A–G. Fig. 4 shows that the temperature difference between he cylinders results in the formation of a eddy with counterclockwise otation. At Ra = 10 3 , the streamlines reveal that the eddy is very weak.\nI b i o s h fi\na a m 1 h m i t d t t t t h t i\no\nfl a u 0\na i b t a R t b w C f fi 1 t C\no fl ( ( f t fl a t f i a w a R\n\uD835\uDF19 a 0 o o o 1 o\n6\nC t i p w f d A F\nn addition, Fig. 4 shows that the rise of Ra results in the boosting of uoyancy force and therefore, the highest value of the stream function ntensifies and some other small eddies start to develop in the vicinity f the cavity walls. Moreover, based on Fig. 7 , some differences are oberved in streamlines of pure fluid and nano-fluid. This is due to the igher viscosity of nano-fluid compared to the pure fluid which intensies the diffusion of momentum in the nano-fluid [48] .\nThe impacts of Ra on the pattern of isotherms for flow of base fluid nd aqueous Cu nano-fluid with \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 inside the cavity for Case 1A–G re depicted in Fig. 5 . The parallelism of the isotherms indicates that the ain mechanism of heat transfer is conduction. Boosting Ra from 10 3 to 0 4 leads to the more dense isotherms and thermal boundary near the eat tube. In higher Ra , the convection becomes the main heat transfer echanism and as a result, the temperature gradient on the body surface ntensifies. In addition, Ra = 10 5 is coincident with the formation of the hermal plumes at the top and bottom of the hot tube, which depicts the ominance of the convection mechanism inside the cavity. Furthermore, he use of nano-fluid leads to the change of isotherms, which is due to he higher momentum diffusion in the nano-fluid in comparison with he base fluid because of its higher viscosity. Also, Fig. 11 demonstrates he higher thickness of thermal boundary layer of the cold tube in lower alf of the cavity in comparison with the upper half. This reveals that he major share of heat transfer is owned by the cold cylinders located n the upper half of the cavity.\nFig. 6 presents variation of total \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 with respect to \uD835\uDF19 and position f hot and cold tube at different Ra (10 3 < Ra < 10 5 ) for different nano-\nuids (Cu-W, Cu-EG and Cu-EG/W). It is clearly seen that for all cases nd for all volume fractions the configuration 30° has the most \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 vales among all other models and it is followed be configurations 60° or °, 90°, 120°, 150° and 180°, respectively.\nFig. 6 a shows variation of \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC61 with respect to \uD835\uDF19 and position of hot nd cold tube at different Ra for aqueous Cu nano-fluid. As it is seen n this figure, the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 values for all configurations (0–180°) intensify y boosting of Ra . This behavior is because of more convection heat ransfer at high Ra . For example for configuration 30° (Case 1B) the verage Nusselt value at \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 is 1.21, 2.06 and 2.92 for Ra = 10 3 , a = 10 4 and Ra = 10 5 , respectively. And in this condition the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 inensifies about 141.6% for Case 1B filled with aqueous Cu nano-fluid y boosting of Ra from 10 3 to 10 5 . Fig. 6 b illustrates variation of \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC61 ith respect to \uD835\uDF19 and position of hot and cold tube at different Ra for u-Ethylene-Glycol nano-fluid. As it is seen in this figure, the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 values or all configurations (0–180°) intensify by boosting of Ra . E.g. for conguration 30° (Case 1B) the average Nusselt value at \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 is 0.82, .66 and 2.19 for Ra = 10 3 , Ra = 10 4 and Ra = 10 5 , respectively. And in his condition the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 intensifies about 167.0% for Case 1B filled with u-EG nano-fluid by boosting of Ra from 10 3 to 10 5 .\nFig. 6 c demonstrates variation of \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC61 with respect to \uD835\uDF19 and position f hot and cold tube at different Ra for Cu-Ethylene-Glycol-water nanouid. As it is seen in this figure, the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 values for all configurations 0–180°) intensify by boosting of Ra . For instance in configuration 30° Case 1B) the average Nusselt value at \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 is 0.93, 1.88 and 2.88 or Ra = 10 3 , Ra = 10 4 and Ra = 10 5 , respectively. And in this condition he \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 intensifies about 202.2% for Case 1B filled with Cu-EG nanouid by boosting of Ra from 10 3 to 10 5 . From Fig. 6 it is realized that for lmost models usage of nano-fluid has a significant influence to enhance he heat transfer characteristics in studied cavity. For example in Fig. 6 a or Ra = 10 4 and configuration 30° is seen that usage of nano-fluid can ntensify the average Nusselt of base fluid from 1.35 to 2.06, which has n 52.6% enhancement in heat transfer. Also, it is found that usage of ater as base fluid leads to more \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 and it is followed by water-EG nd EG base fluid. On the other side, it is seen that for Ra = 10 4 and a = 10 5 cases, the average Nusselt value always intensifies by growing and hence for Ra = 10 4 and Ra = 10 5 cases the \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 is introduced s the optimum \uD835\uDF19. It is while for Ra = 10 3 case by growing the \uD835\uDF19 from to 0.01 or 0.02 the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 intensifies. But by intensify of \uD835\uDF19 from 0.01 r 0.02 to 0.05 the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 reduces. Therefore, for each case there is an ptimal \uD835\uDF19 which is 0.01 or 0.02. Finally, according to obtained results f this section, in case of using two tubes, the configuration 30° (Case B) is introduced as the best geometry with the highest \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 among all ther configurations.\n.2. Models with three tubes\nIn this section, usage of different nano-fluids (Cu-Water, Cu-EG and u-Water/EG) is investigated in space between two adiabatic horizonal coaxial cylinders equipped with two cold tubes and one hot tube n which are located in different stations. Fig. 7 demonstrates the imacts of Ra on the streamlines of base fluid and aqueous Cu nano-fluid ith \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 through the cavity for Cases 2A–C. It can be understood rom this figure that the difference between the temperature of cyliners results in the formation of an eddy with counterclockwise rotation. t Ra = 10 3 , the streamlines depicts the weakness of eddy. In addition, ig. 7 illustrates that the rise of Ra results in the boosting of buoyancy\nlled with water.\nf fi c i v d t C w f 1 l m h s t t n l d o a c t c\na d f v r o A i N g T f i F fl s b t R i F a\nfl\norce and therefore, the highest value of the stream function intensies and some other small eddies start to develop in the vicinity of the avity walls. Moreover, based on Fig. 7 , some differences are observed n streamlines of pure fluid and nano-fluid. This is due to the higher iscosity of nano-fluid compared to the pure fluid which intensifies the iffusion of momentum in the nano-fluid [48] . Also, it is realized that he strongest to weakest eddies respectively belongs to the cases 2C, ase 2A and Case 2B Fig. 8 illustrates isotherms inside the cavity filled ith pure fluid and aqueous Cu nano-fluid with \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 at different Ra or cases 2A–2C. It is realized that the intensification of the Ra from 0 3 to 10 4 results in the more dense isotherms and thermal boundary ayer becomes more dense near the heat source/sink. By further augentation of Ra , the contribution of the convection mechanism to the eat transfer increases and, as a result, the temperature gradient on the urface of the body intensifies. In addition, Ra = 10 5 is coincident with he formation of the thermal plumes at the top and bottom of the hot ube, which depicts that the convection mechanism is completely domiant inside the cavity. Furthermore, it is seen that the use of nano-fluid eads to the change of isotherms, which is due to the higher momentum iffusion in the nano-fluid in comparison with the base fluid because f its higher viscosity. Also, Fig. 8 displays that the thermal boundry layer around the cold tube in lower half of the cavity is thicker ompared to the upper one. This reveals that the major share of heat ransfer is owned by the cold cylinders located in the upper half of the avity.\nFig. 9 shows variation of \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC61 with respect to \uD835\uDF19 and position of hot nd cold tube at different Ra (10 3 < Ra < 10 5 ) for Cases 2A–C filled with ifferent nano-fluids (Cu-W, Cu-EG and Cu-EG/W). It is clearly seen that or all cases and for all volume fractions the Case 2C has the most \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 alues among all other models and it is followed be Case 2A and Case 2B, espectively. Fig. 9 a shows variation of \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC61 with respect to \uD835\uDF19 and varius nano-fluids (Cu-W, Cu-EG and Cu-EG/W) at different Ra for Case 2A. s it is seen in this figure, the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 values for Case 2A at Ra = 10 3 always ntensify by boosting of nanoadditives \uD835\uDF19 and for \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 the maximum u avg is achieved. It is while for Case 2A at Ra = 10 4 and Ra = 10 5 by rowing \uD835\uDF19 till a certain value the Nu avg intensifies and then it is reduced. herefore, in these situations there is also an optimum \uD835\uDF19. For example or Case 2A filled with Cu-Water the average Nusselt value at \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 s 1.16, 1.79 and 3.57 for Ra = 10 3 , Ra = 10 4 and Ra = 10 5 , respectively. ig. 9 b shows variation of \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC61 with respect to \uD835\uDF19 and various nanouids (Cu-W, Cu-EG and Cu-EG/W) at different Ra for Case 2B As it is een in this figure, the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 values for Case 2B at Ra = 10 3 decrease by oosting of \uD835\uDF19 till a certain \uD835\uDF19 and then intensify. Hence, there is an opimum Nu avg in this situation. It is while for Case 2B at Ra = 10 4 and a = 10 5 by growing \uD835\uDF19 till a certain value the Nu avg intensifies and then t is reduced. Therefore, in these situations there is also an optimum \uD835\uDF19. or example for Case 2B filled with Cu-Water the average Nusselt value t \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 is 0.61 and 3.32 for Ra = 10 3 and Ra = 10 5 , respectively.\nFig. 9 c shows variation of \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC61 with respect to \uD835\uDF19 and various nanouids (Cu-W, Cu-EG and Cu-EG/W) at different Ra for Case 2C. As it\nFig. 8.

Hence, there is an ptimum Nu avg in this situation. It is while for Case 2C at Ra = 10 4 and a = 10 5 by growing \uD835\uDF19 the Nu avg always intensifies. Therefore, in these ituations there is also an optimum \uD835\uDF19 ( \uD835\uDF19= 0.05). For example for Case C filled with Cu-Water the average Nusselt value at \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 volume raction is 1.00 and 3.76 for Ra = 10 3 and Ra = 10 5 , respectively. Finally, ccording to obtained results of this section, in case of using three tubes, he Case 2C is introduced as the best geometry with the highest \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 mong all other configurations.\n.3. Models with four tubes\nIn this section, usage of different nano-fluids (Cu-Water, Cu-EG and u-Water/EG) is investigated in space between two adiabatic horizontal oaxial cylinders equipped with three or two cold tubes and one or two ot tubes which they are located in different stations. Fig. 10 demontrates the impacts of Ra on the streamlines of pure fluid and aqueous Cu ano-fluid with \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 inside the cavity for Cases 3A–C. The difference etween the temperature of cylinders leads to the formation of an eddy ith counterclockwise rotation. At Ra = 10 3 , the streamlines depicts the eakness of eddy. In addition, Fig. 10 depicts that the augmentation f Ra results in the boosting of buoyancy force and therefore, the highst value of the stream function intensifies and some other small eddies tart to develop in the vicinity of the cavity walls. Moreover, based on ig. 10 some differences are observed in streamlines of pure fluid and ano-fluid. This can be attributed to the higher viscosity of nano-fluid ompared to the pure fluid which intensifies the diffusion of momentum\nn the nano-fluid [48] . Also, it is realized that the strongest to weakest ddies respectively belongs to the cases 3B, Case 3C and Case 3A. Fig. 11 llustrates isotherms inside the cavity filled with pure fluid and aqueous u nano-fluid with \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 at different Ra for Cases 3A–C.\nIt is realized that intensifying the Ra from 10 3 to 10 4 makes the sotherms more dense and the thickness of thermal boundary layer delines near the heat source/sink. By further augmentation of Ra , the ontribution of the convection mechanism to the heat transfer increases nd, as a result, the temperature gradient on the surface of the body ntensifies. In addition, Ra = 10 5 is coincident with the formation of the hermal plumes at the top and bottom of the hot tube, which depicts that he convection mechanism is completely dominant inside the cavity. urthermore, it is seen that the use of nano-fluid leads to the change of sotherms, which is due to the higher momentum diffusion in the nanouid in comparison with the base fluid because of its higher viscosity. lso, Fig. 11 demonstrates that the thermal boundary layer around the old tube in lower half of the cavity is thicker compared to the upper ne. This reveals that the major share of heat transfer is owned by the old cylinders located in the upper half of the cavity.\nFig. 12 shows variation of \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC61 with respect to \uD835\uDF19 and position of hot nd cold tube at different Ra (10 3 < Ra < 10 5 ) for Cases 3A–3 filled with ifferent nano-fluids (Cu-W, Cu-EG and Cu-EG/W). It is clearly seen that or all cases and for all volume fractions the Case 3B has the most \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 alues among all other models and it is followed be Case 3C and Case A, respectively. Fig. 12 a shows variation of \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC61 with respect to \uD835\uDF19 and arious nano-fluids (Cu-W, Cu-EG and Cu-EG/W) at different Ra for Case A. As it is seen in this figure, the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 values for Case 3A at Ra = 10 3 educe by boosting of \uD835\uDF19 till a certain \uD835\uDF19 and then intensify. It is while\nFig. 11.

Therefore, in all situations here is an optimum \uD835\uDF19. For example for Case 3A filled with Cu-Water he average Nusselt value at \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 is 0.61, 2.22 and 3.87 for Ra = 10 3 , a = 10 4 and Ra = 10 5 , respectively. Fig. 12 b shows variation of \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC61 ith respect to \uD835\uDF19 and various nano-fluids (Cu-W, Cu-EG and Cu-EG/W) t different Ra for Case 3B As it is seen in this figure, the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 values for ase 3B at all studied Ra intensify by boosting of \uD835\uDF19 till a certain \uD835\uDF19 and hen intensify. Hence, there is an optimum Nu avg for each situation. For xample for Case 3B filled with Cu-Water the average Nusselt value at = 0.05 is 1.16 and 5.68 for Ra = 10 3 and Ra = 10 5 , respectively. Fig. 12 c shows variation of \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC61 with respect to \uD835\uDF19 and various nanouids (Cu-W, Cu-EG and Cu-EG/W) at various Ra for Case 3C. As seen, he \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 values for Case 3C at all studied Ra intensify by boosting of \uD835\uDF19 ill a certain \uD835\uDF19 and then intensify. Hence, there is an optimum Nu avg for ll situations. For example for Case 3C filled with Cu-Water the average usselt value at \uD835\uDF19= 0.05 is 1.00 and 3.76 for Ra = 10 3 and Ra = 10 5 , espectively. Finally, according to obtained results of this section, in case of using\nhree tubes, the Case 3B is introduced as the best geometry with the ighest \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 among all other configurations.\nAn important issue is that in some cases by boosting of \uD835\uDF19 the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 educes and in some cases the \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 of tubes which are located in cavities lled with nano-fluid is less than cavities filled with base fluid. It is clear hat nano-fluids thermal conductivity intensifies comparing to the base uid so it is not possible to attribute this reduction in Nusselt number o thermal conductivity however it has an impact on Nusselt number inensify certainly. But it is also clear that the nano-fluid density and speific heat have great changes comparing to base fluid. The calculations how that the Pr is approximately 0.7 in the case of using the base fluid nd this demonstrates that the thermal boundary layer thickness is more han velocity boundary layer. By boosting the \uD835\uDF19 the Pr decreased and for nstance it reached to about 0.4 in \uD835\uDF19= 0.05. Besides in the case of using ano-fluid the thermal diffusion coefficient intensify and kinetic viscosty decrease. These items show that in the case of using nano-fluid the hermal boundary layers become thicker and velocity boundary layers ecome thinner. The intense intensify in thermal boundary layer based n Eq. (24) leads to less temperature gradient within thermal boundary ayer and consequently the Nusselt number reduces on the tube surface nd it while the thermal conductivity of nano-fluid is more than base uid.\nAt last the optimum models are presented in Table 3 .\n7\nh c w a t t f t 1 f 2 b f \uD835\uDC41 C\nA\nD S\nR\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n. Conclusions\nIn this work, the free convective flow between several differentially ot and cold tubes enclosed in a space between two horizontal adiabatic oaxial cylinders which filled with three different kinds of nano-fluids as investigated numerically. The control-volume based finite volume pproach was utilized to perform the required simulations. According o the obtained results, usage of nano-fluid has a noticeable impact on he hydrothermal aspects of the studied cavity. For all cases and volume ractions of configurations with two cylinders the configuration 30° has he most \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 values which is followed by configurations 60° or 0°, 90°, 20°, 150° and 180°, respectively. It is clearly seen that for all cases and or all volume fractions of configurations with three cylinders the Case C has the most \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 values among all other models and it is followed e Case 2A and Case 2B, respectively. For all cases and for all volume ractions of configurations with four cylinders the Case 3B has the most \uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC56 values among all other models and it is followed be Case 3C and\nase 3A, respectively.\ncknowledgments\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key Research and evelopment Program of China ( 2016YFB0100903 ), in part by JITRI uzhou Automotive Research Institute Project (CEC20190404).\neferences\n[1] Shahsavar A , Talebizadeh P , Toghraie D .

    "abstractText" : "In the present numerical study, the free convective flow between several differentially hot and cold tubes enclosed in a space between two horizontal adiabatic coaxial cylinders which filled with three different kinds of nano-fluids is investigated. The effects of influential aspects including; location of heat source/sink, number of tubes, Rayleigh number ( Ra ), volume concentration ( φ) and type of the nanoadditives on the isotherms, streamline, stream function and average Nusselt number ( Nu i ) are explored. The governing equations are solved numerically employing control-volume based finite volume technique. For pressure-velocity coupling, the Semi-Implicit Method is utilized. According to the obtained results, usage of nano-fluid leads to the considerable enhancement of heat transfer in the studied cavity. For all the examined configurations with two cylinders, the configuration 30° has the most Nu i values which is followed by configurations 60° or 0°, 90°, 120°, 150° and 180°, respectively. It is clearly seen that for all the assessed configurations with three cylinders, the highest to lowest Nu i respectively belongs to the Case 2C, Case 2A and Case 2B. Moreover, for all the investigated configurations with four cylinders, the highest and lowest Nu i respectively occurs at Case 3B and Case 3A.",
