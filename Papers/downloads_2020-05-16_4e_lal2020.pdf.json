Heavy metals accumulated in soil and water bodies enter into the food chain, and their hazardous effects on human health have been investigated extensively. Chromium and arsenic represent the toxic metals widely present in wastewater, and their high concentrations cause a life-threatening impact on human health. Many nano adsorbents have been developed to reduce the level of Cr and As ions from wastewater; however, their efficiencies are low. Recently, various carbonaceous nanomaterials have been developed with extraordinary and tunable physical-chemical properties to exhibit outstanding adsorption efficacy for heavy metals. The application of various carbonaceous nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and chemically modified forms and modifications have been discussed in detail in the present review article for the removal of Cr and As ions from wastewater."

      "text" : "Water is the primary need for the survival of human and animal beings. Among various sources responsible for water pollution, heavy metals are one of the primary sources [1]. Heavy metals are naturally occurring elements with high atomic weight and density as high as five times as water [2]. Weathering of soils and rocks, volcanic eruption, various anthropogenic activities including mining, processing, or use of metal pollutants are the sources of heavy metal introduction into the water system. The most common water-polluting heavy metals are arsenic, chromium, cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, and mercury. Heavy metals tend to bioaccumulate in the body, and their consumption above bio recommended limits leads to various biotoxic effects to the body [3]. Among all the heavy metals, arsenic (As) and chromium (Cr) are the major causes of water pollution by anthropogenic and natural sources.\nArsenic is known to be highly toxic to all life forms and has been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a group 1 human carcinogenic substance [4,5]. The chronic intake of inorganic As (above 50 μg/L) in drinking water causes different kinds of skin disorders (e.g., hyperpigmentation, hyperkeratosis) and cancer (skin, lung, kidney, bladder) which are collectively known as arsenicosis [6]. It has been reported that As is a metalloid that can exist in its organic forms as monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and\ntrimethylarsine oxide. And it also exists as trivalent arsenite As(III) and pentavalent arsenate As (V) in its inorganic forms. The toxicity of these species increases in the order: DMA–MMA–arsenate–arsenite [7]. As (III) is more harmful to human health than As(V) as it is more cytotoxic, genotoxic, mobile, and soluble. It has been well reported that the toxicity of arsenic is decided by the various factors, including the exposure dose, frequency, duration, biological species, age, gender, individual susceptibilities, genetic and nutritional values [8]. As (III) can inactivate about 200 enzymes in the body and As (V) can replace phosphate involved in many biochemical reactions and hence shows various adverse effects on different organ systems [9]. Therefore, the WHO recommended maximum contaminant limit (MCL) of 10 μg/L for arsenic in drinking water instead of its previous guideline (50 μg/L). The MCL recommended for chromium in drinking water is 0.1 mg/L. The high concentration of Cr also exerts strong toxic effects as it can diffuse through the cell membranes, oxidize biological molecules, and create a potential risk of living being healthy. Cr ions usually exist as Cr (III) and Cr(VI) in the water sources. The Cr(VI) is about 100 times more toxic than Cr(III), and it is a well known carcinogenic element present in drinking water [10]. Cr(VI) occurs in the form of CrO4− or Cr2O72oxyanions in water. Cr (VI) is responsible for skin tumors in animals, and it also damages the DNA by forming the Cr-DNA adduct. Cr (VI) is known to be responsible for stomach cancer, as well.\nVarious methods, including adsorption, dialysis, extraction, ion-\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2020.101276 Received 13 December 2019; Received in revised form 1 April 2020; Accepted 6 April 2020\n⁎ Corresponding author.

Due to the cost-effectiveness, ease in availability and operation, high efficiency for heavy metal removal and regeneration after use, the adsorption technique is one of the promising methods of choice. Carbonaceous materials with microporous and mesoporous structures, large surface area, and versatile adsorption qualities find their potential in the removal of heavy metal ions from polluted water reservoirs [12].\nNanotechnology has gained broad interest in almost every field of science as nanosized materials offer improved qualities and find potential in widespread applications [13]. Maitlo et al. recently published a review article based on the application of nanomaterials for chromium removal from water, highlighting the influence of various factors, synergetic effect, and a possible mechanism for adsorption phenomenon [14].\nAnother recent review article by Baby et al. [15] demonstrated the varied applications of different carbon nanomaterials in the removal of varying water pollutants, including heavy metals. They have also focused on the bio-compatibility of different carbon structures, which offers an additional advantage to their use in environmental remediation. Agarwal et al. reported the recent advances in the application of commercially available nano adsorbents and bio-adsorbents in the removal of heavy metals from water [16]. Yang et al. [17] described the importance of carbon nanomaterials, zero-valent metal nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles and different other nanocomposites in the separation of heavy metals from wastewater.\nKalarikkal et al. have prepared various nanomaterials for a wide range of applications [18,19] [20]. Their research group fabricated polylactic acid /nano chitosan-based composite fibers for effective adsorption of cadmium ions from water [21]. They have also developed ionic liquids modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes embedded with styrene-butadiene rubber for the preparation of membranes, which was used for the selective removal of toluene from the azeotropic mixture of toluene and methanol [22]. It was observed that the benzyl group of the ionic liquid unit plays a vital role in selective binding with toluene.\nGopakumar et al. reported the development of nanocellulose materials for different applications [23–25]. They reported the synthesis of antibacterial nanopaper for the removal of anionic dyes [26]. They also prepared cellulose nanofiber aerogels through silanization process for their environmental remediation application [27]. These nanostructures can be easily synthesized for their commercialized use by the easy, economical and environmentally friendly method. These nanomaterials can effectively remove dyes from the water. They have developed nanocellolulose materials for water purification applications [28–31].\nGopi et al. reported the synthesis of 3-D cross-linked hydrogels using graphene oxide materials and borax crosslinker [32]. The nanostructure possessed high surface area and exhibited high adsorption efficiency for heavy metals and dyes. They developed cellulose acetate/ chitosan [33], and cellulose acetate/carboxymethyl cellulose [34] blend films by eco-friendly solvent casting method and used them for the removal of dyes from the water. They reported the fabrication hybrid bioaerogels using cellulose nanofibers and chitin nanocrystals and used them for the removal of dyes [35].\nVadakkekara et al. also worked on the development of different modified and functionalized nanocellulose materials. They synthesized nanocellulose using cheap and readily available jute fiber and then grafted it with sodium itaconate. This nanomaterial acted as an excellent adsorbent for lead ions via the ion exchange process [36]. They also reported the modification of nanocellulose with maleic acid, which was a superb chemisorbant for the removal of lead from water [37]. They also modified cellulose nanofiber with meldrum’s acid and then developed its polyvinylidene fluoride-based microfiltration membrane for the removal of dyes from water [38].\nBeeran et al. reported the modification of cellulose nanofibrils by graphene oxide incorporated 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl for\nthe removal of dyes from water [39]. They also developed film-like xerogels and porous cryogels from cellulose nanofibrils and reduced graphene oxide [40]. The recent development in the synthesis and processing of 2-D nanomaterials with the desired structure, large surface area, and broad applicability has also been reported by their group [41].\nIn recent years, nanosized carbonaceous materials have also been reported to show enhanced efficiency in water remediation technologies [42,43]. Carbon nanomaterials are gaining more importance over other nanomaterials due to its different advantageous properties including high surface area, mechanical strength, electric and optical properties, layered structure, lightweight, chemical stability, high ease of biodegradation, porous framework, controlled pore size distribution, intense binding energy, and high π-π electrostatic forces. Various carbonaceous materials used for removal of As and Cr heavy metal ions include graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, and activated carbon materials. The applications and modifications of various carbonaceous materials for the removal of As and Cr ions from wastewater has been discussed in the present review."

      "text" : "In recent decades, different types of carbon-based nanomaterials have been used widely for heavy metal remediation. It has been demonstrated that the nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, activated carbons, carbon fibers, etc. play an essential role in the wastewater treatment processes by effectively removing As and Cr ions from water samples.\nThe variable adsorption mechanisms have been anticipated to act simultaneously on the surface of carbonaceous nanomaterials depending upon the surface functionalization and environmental test conditions [44]. As the adsorption relies on the availability of active sites, in the case of activated charcoal adsorbent, physical/chemical activation need to be performed for efficient adsorption phenomenon. On the other hand, nano-dimensional graphene having high surface area disperses and unfolds in aqueous media providing higher interaction and adsorption sites for the pollutants as compared to activated carbon. Graphene oxide contains various oxygen-containing surface functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxylic, epoxide, etc. which not only helps in its homogeneous dispersion but also interact with multiple pollutants via electrostatic interaction and π-π interaction [45]. The adsorption mechanism of heavy metals by CNTs relies on the surface feature, electrochemical potential, and ion exchange process. The pristine CNT shows meager adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions, but that could be significantly enhanced by oxidation with HNO3, NaOCl, or KMnO4 [44]. The oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of CNTs allow for binding metal ions and organic pollutants via physical adsorption, electrostatic interaction, precipitation, and chemical interactions [46]. Besides surface functional groups of carbon nanomaterials, it was observed that an increase in solution pH and temperature also increased the adsorption of metal ions. This may be attributed to the higher diffusion rate of metal ions, lower activation energy of adsorption, solution viscosity, and structural changes [47].\nAlthough, as an adsorbent, every carbonaceous nanomaterial offer unique structural and functional characteristics, they all have active surface functional groups in common, providing physical/chemical interactions, responsible for the adsorption of heavy metals [48]. The impact of the presence of surface functional groups on separation application is well established in the literature [49]. By using physical/ chemical modification methods, functionality, and quantity of the heteroatom (O, N, S) containing functional groups can be enhanced on the surface of carbonaceous nanomaterials (Fig. 1). Such modification may lead to the alteration/ enhancement of the various surface properties of carbon nanomaterials such as specific surface area, pore size distribution/volume, etc. [50]. There are various mechanisms\nresponsible for the separation/adsorption of heavy metals like As and Cr by carbonaceous nanomaterials, including physical adsorption, electrostatic interaction, ion exchange, surface complexation, and precipitation. It depends upon the surface chemistry of carbonaceous nanomaterial as adsorbents, ionic environment of the aqueous media, and nature of the adsorbate, as depicted in Fig. 2 [50].\nA thorough molecular dynamic simulation study for adsorption of metal ions by surface-functionalized CNT’s was reported by Anitha et al. [47]. It has been reported that the CNT–COO– surface effectively adsorbs over 150–230 % more metal ions compared to the bare CNT surface. On the other hand, –OH and –CONH2 are relatively weak functional groups where excess metal ions adsorption compared to the bare CNT is in the range 10–47 %. The effect of the various functional groups of nanomaterials on maximum adsorption capacity (Qmax) is\nlisted in Table 1."

      "text" : "Graphene has gained considerable attention in the field of water treatment due to its remarkable adsorption capability. It can be easily obtained from graphite and hence offers a non-expensive method to remove heavy metal ions and other pollutants from wastewater. It occurs in the form of a carbon sheet with an sp2 hybridized structure and possesses a large surface area. However, it gets challenging to separate graphene from the water after adsorption of contaminants that may lead to nanotoxicity or recontamination. Hence, researchers have explored different functionalized graphene materials to get better outcomes of graphene properties [57].\nAmong the chemically functionalized graphene, graphene oxide (GO) acts as remarkable adsorbent material decorated with a variety of hydrophilic oxygen-containing functional groups such as carbonyl (–C=O), carboxyl (–COOH), epoxy (C–O–C) and hydroxyl (–OH) throughout the GO sheets [58]. Graphene oxide can be easily synthesized from graphene by treating with acid using a modified Hummers procedure [59]. The increased surface area and presence of oxygencontaining functional groups of GO allow the formation of the membrane with enhanced water permeability through the graphene oxide sheets. They hence offer increased potential for its use in water remediation [60]. It has been used for the efficient removal of heavy metal ions, and other organic and inorganic pollutants from waste water [61–63]. Owing to its great beneficial uses in water remediation, researchers have explored further functionalization of GO to achieve even better results [64,65]. It can be obtained either by chemical reactions at oxygen-containing functional groups or non-covalent interactions of other molecules with GO or its reduced form."

      "text" : "The modification of GO by magnetic nanoparticles has been widely explored for the removal of organic and inorganic water pollutants. Chandra et al. have reported the application of water-dispersible magnetite modified reduced GO for the removal of As ions from aqueous media [66]. Adsorption data calculated from the Langmuir model shows maximum adsorption capacity for As (V) and As (III) as 5.83 mg/ g and 13.10 mg/g, respectively. It has been well established that As (V) exist in the anionic form (H2AsO3) and As (III) exist in its neutral form (H3AsO4) over a wide range of pH, thus emphasizing the role of pH in\nadsorption phenomenon. It has been reported that at pH>point of zero charges, the adsorbent is negatively charged, and at pH<point of zero cost, the adsorbent is positively charged. Thereby, adsorbent exhibits high As (V) adsorption at low pH. However, at high pH, the adsorption process is followed by surface complexation, rather than electrostatic interactions as high As (III) adsorption was observed at high pH value. Hang et al. have reported the maximum adsorption capacity for As (III) and As (V) as 54.18 mg/g and 26.76 m/g, respectively, using magnetic iron oxide@GO with the iron content of 51 wt % [67].\nInterestingly, the elemental distribution map generated through the X-ray fluorescent technique suggests that As(V) is preferentially associated with iron oxides during the adsorption process and that the distribution of Fe and As is directly correlated. Yan et al. have reported the synthesis of three-dimensional nanostructured Fe3O4/graphene aerogels for the removal of As ions from water [68]. The aerogels exhibit a significant capacity of As(V) ions adsorption up to 40.048 mg/g. The adsorption isotherm has been well correlated with the Langmuir model, which follows pseudo-second-order kinetics for the adsorption process.\nSuresh Kumar et al. has reported the excellent adsorption properties of nanohybrids of single-layer GO and magnetic manganese ferrite for Pb and As ions [69]. The GO-MnFe2O4 nanocomposite effectively removes heavy metals, and the nano adsorbent could be easily recovered using external magnet from the water sample (Fig. 3). Adsorption mechanism of As on these manganese ferrites GO nanohybrids have been explained on the behaviour of As and adsorbent at different pH conditions. As (V) exists in different ionic and neutral forms such as H3AsO4° (pH<2.1), H2AsO4− (2.1< pH<6.9), HAsO42− (6.9< pH<11.5), and AsO43− (pH>11.5) [70]. Whereas in natural environmental pH (4 − 8) conditions, As(III) exists in As(OH)3° and AsO(OH)2− and As(V) exists in H2AsO4− and HAsO42− ionic forms [71,72]. At pH below 4.3, H2AsO4− species remain in higher concentration, whereas the −OH groups on nanoparticles convert to −OH2+ ions favoring the adsorption of As(V) [72]. Conversion of As (III) to As (V) is attributed to the presence of an enormous number of the active site in the manganese environment to expedite the adsorption\nprocess. The decrease in the solution pH, due to precipitation of manganese (II) arsenate, also favours the adsorption process [73]. Change in the solution pH before and after adsorption process, the effect of temperature and other parameters are well illustrated in the concerned literature. Shahrin et al. reported two new hybrid nanomaterials, GO‐manganese ferrite (GMF) and titania nanotube‐manganese ferrite (TMF), for their application in removal of As (V) by adsorption process. The maximum adsorption capacity for As (V) removal using GMF and TMF was found to be 102 mg/g and 80.8 mg/g, respectively [74].\nRezaee et al. have developed GO-based nanocomposite membranes by modified Hummer’s method for As (V) removal from aqueous media. It has been found that increased GO coating on membrane increases the rejection of arsenate ions. With the initial concentration of 1000 μg L−1, the maximum percentage of arsenate rejection was 86.7 %. The removal of As ions by the nanostructure is attributed to the exceptional hydrophilic behaviour of GO [75].\nChitosan, a natural biopolymer, has been widely explored for environmental remediation due to its versatile properties, biodegradability, non-toxicity, and the presence of numerous hydrophilic amine and hydroxyl functional groups. Jiang et al. have devolved chitosan modified GO as an efficient adsorbent for As ion removal from aqueous solution [76]. The several responsible interactions such as cation–π interaction, RNH3+- aromatic π system, electrostatic interaction (H2AsO4−, HAsO42- -+NH3R), inter and intermolecular hydrogen bonding as well as anion–π interaction (R−COO− - aromatic π system and R–O− - aromatic π system) have been proposed for As removal from aqueous media using chitosan modified GO."

      "text" : "Kumar et al. have reported the modification of GO with ionic liquid (IL) for the improved extraction of hexavalent chromium from waste water [77]. The enhanced adsorption property of the nanocomposite is attributed to the electrostatic interaction of hexachromate anion with ionic moieties of IL. Recently, Jiang et al. have proposed a sandwich nanocomposite of GO, iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles, manganese dioxide nanowires and polypyrrole for efficient removal of hexavalent\nTable 1 Effect of functional groups of carbon nanomaterials on Qmax.\nNanomaterial Metal Removed Qmax (mg/g) Functional group Reference`\nGraphene sand composite Cr(VI) 2859.38 OH, –COOH, –OCH3 [51] Polyethyleneimine and GO Cr(VI) 539.53 COOH, –NH2 [52] Three-dimensional graphene foam As(V) 177.6 –C–C, –C=C [53] Sulfuric acid doped poly diaminopyridine/graphene composite Cr(VI) 609.76 –NH, –C=C [54] Poly(m-phenylenediamine)-coated Fe3O4/o-MWCNTs Cr(VI) 346 –NH [55] Nitrogen-doped magnetic CNTs Cr(III) 638.56 –C–C [56]\nCr from wastewater using adsorption-reduction mechanism [78]. GO provides the functional groups with the large surface area for effective adsorption while magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles offered easy separation and recovery from water. MnO2 acted as an oxidant and template for polymerization of pyrrole on the activated surface of nanocomposite GO/MnO2/Fe3O4/PPy(GMFP). The effect of pH on adsorption has also been demonstrated, and partial reduction of adsorbed Cr(VI) to Cr(III) leading to effective adsorption has been explained. Li et al. have developed a modified GO-complex with magnetic cyclodextrin-chitosan that showed productive potential in chromium (VI) removal [79]. Functionalization with magnetic complex imparted enhanced adsorption qualities to graphene oxide due to improved surface charge concentration, larger surface area, and better binding sites. Wang et al. developed a nanocomposite of reduced graphene oxide (RGO), polyethyleneimine (PEI), and magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) through oxidation-reduction reaction, which effectively adsorbed Cr(VI) via electrostatic attraction and then partially reduced them to less toxic Cr(III) [80]. The optimal nanocomposite of RGO/PEI/ Fe3O4 was represented as ORTF. A magnet can easily recover the ORPF after adsorption of Cr ions with its maximum removal capacity of 266.6 mg/g (Fig. 4)."

      "text" : "Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are one of the most promising carbonbased nanomaterials discovered by Iijima [81] having unique structural, electronic, mechanical, optoelectronic, semiconductor, and physiochemical properties. Due to their unique structure and properties, they represent an attractive class of carbon-based nanomaterials that have found wide application in the removal of heavy metals and dyes in wastewater treatment [82,83]. According to their superstructure, CNT can be classified as single-walled and multiwalled CNTs. Single-walled CNT is one sheet of graphene rolled in a cylindrical form. In contrast, multi-wall CNTs are multiple layers of graphene sheets rolled over each\nother in a cylindrical shape with a spacing of 0.34 nm between adjacent layers. The characteristic properties of CNT can be improved by functionalization with different types of metals resulting in the increase of oxygen, nitrogen, and other surface functional groups with enhanced dispersibility and specific surface area. A wide range of studies for the removal of heavy metals by CNT has been reported for water remediation [84]. CNT has excellent potential to remove many types of heavy metals, including Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu, As, etc. [85]. To enhance the sorption capacities, CNTs can be modified by oxidation, combining with other metal ions or metal oxides, and coupling with organic compounds [85]. The mechanism for metal ion adsorption on CNT was attributed to the electrostatic interaction and chemical interaction between metal ion and surface functional groups of CNT."

      "text" : "Al Omar et al. has reported the functionalization of CNT using deep eutectic solvents (DESs) based on N, N-diethyl ethanol ammonium chloride, and glycerol for the removal of As(III) from water [86]. Optimum removal conditions for As (III) (17 mg/g) were found to be at pH 6.0 with an adsorbent dosage of 20 mg and contact time of 55 min using response surface methodology central composite experimental design setup. Multistage functionalized MWCNT was developed by Budimirovic et al. with enhanced surface terminal amino groups followed by subsequent modification by iron (oxy) hydroxide for As (V) removal [87]. This study reports 91−97% adsorption of As (V) on the developed MWCNT at pH value lower than 7.12 pHPZC due to the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged adsorbent surface and negatively charged monovalent anion H2AsO4− (pKa1 2.3). Kausar et al. fabricated polystyrene nanocomposite films with 4-aminophenyl methyl sulphone and CNT as nanofiller and studied their biodegradation behaviour and As (V) sorption capabilities. Sorption result indicates that CNT formed some network with polystyrene, which can be used for the removal of As (V) upto 99 % efficiency [88]. Aranda et al. have developed a method for the determination of ultra-trace amount of As (V) present in water sample adsorbed on MWCNT modified with tertiary amine aliquot using the XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) technique. The author suggests the applicability of the method for better selectivity, detection limit, wide pH range, reproducibility, and exemption of organic solvents for estimation of trace amount of As in water sample [89].\nVarious modifications and functionalization of CNT’s have been reported to overcome the aggregation problem and insolubility issue of CNT’s in aqueous media. Especially, incorporating the magnetic behaviour of iron oxide with adsorption properties of CNT is of great interest due to the fast and effective action in the removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater. Bo Chen et al. have synthesized magnetic iron oxide CNT through a solid phase method and subsequently functionalized it by glutathione through a facile chemical route for enhanced As (III) adsorption capacity. These magnetic heterogeneous CNT surfaces have shown a maximum adsorption capacity of 19.12 mg g−1 for As (III) [90]. To overcome the tedious, uneconomical, and environmentally unfriendly liquid phase synthesis procedure, Chen et al. have developed a one-pot solid-phase synthetic methodology for the development of magnetic iron oxide CNT for As removal [91]. The synthesized magnetic iron oxide CNTs bear characteristics of an ideal adsorbent, including high specific surface area, high dispersibility, and desirable magnetic properties with a high adsorption capacity of 47.41 mg/g and 24.04 mg/g for As (III) and As (V), respectively. Vadahanambi et al. developed graphene@CNT@iron oxide nanostructures by microwave route with amino functionalization, which exhibited excellent As removal efficiency due to its porous structure and the high surface-volume ratio [92] (Fig. 5).\nNalini et al. have reported the development of zero-valent iron nanoparticles impregnated MWCNTs (multi-walled carbon nanotubes) for As removal from aqueous media [93]. EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) used as a chelating agent in the MWCNT, was\nresponsible for the preservation of the zerovalent state of iron. The As adsorption data fitted to the Langmuir model have shown maximum adsorption capacity of 111 mg/g and 66 mg/g for As (III) and As (V). The presence of surface functional groups, including hydroxyl, amino, and carboxyl groups, played an essential role in the adsorption of As on the synthesized MWCNT. Recycling studies indicate the performance of this adsorbent up to 5 cycles without any considerable reduction in the adsorption capacity.\nIn a study, TiO2 coated CNT network filter was prepared by the filtration steam hydrolysis method and further evaluated for the As removal in aqueous media [94]. A 5.5 nm thick TiO2 coating has wholly covered the CNT surface and enhanced the surface area upto196 mg/g almost two-fold more significant than the pristine CNT. Electro assisted sorption capacity of these network filters was found to be about 1.8 and 1.3 mg/g for As (III) and As (V), respectively. CNTs can also be functionalized to increase removal efficiency for metal ions. PEG (polyethylene glycol) functionalized CNT has been studied by Velickovic et al. for the removal of As from waste water [95]. It was reported that the maximum adsorption capacity of this adsorbent for As was 13 mg/g using initial concentration As of 10 mg/ L at pH 4. The magnetron sputtering technique has reported the functionalization of CNT without chemical treatment by depositing copper on the CNT membrane (Cu/ CNT) [96]. The removal of As(III) using Cu/CNT was compared with Cu/MCE (MCE-mixed cellulose ester), which possesses similar permeability. The As(III) removal efficiency was more than 90 % with Cu/ CNT, whereas only 75 % removal efficiency was observed with Cu/ MCE. The As ions removal took place in two steps. Firstly, Cu catalyzed oxidation of As(III) to As(V) takes place and then there is efficient\nadsorption of As(V) on the membrane (Fig. 6)."

The modified MWCNTs showed enhanced adsorption capability in the removal of chromium ions from waste water [97]. Song and group have reported the synthesis of reticulated vitreous carbonCNT (RVC-CNT) electrode as a more efficient biocathode in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) for improved removal of hexavalent chromium ions from wastewater along with the generation of electricity [98]. The RVC-CNT offered enhanced electron transfer rate and electrical conductivity, which in turn facilitated enhanced Cr(VI) reduction by providing more reaction sites. Tawabini and co-workers have reported the efficient removal of Cr(III) from wastewater using modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes with varying conditions of adsorbent dose, pH, agitation speed, and contact time. They demonstrated that the physical and chemical properties of modified CNTs (M-CNTs) best suited the affinity of Cr(III) ions to get adsorbed onto M-CNTs and hence enhanced adsorption efficiency of CNTs could be obtained for Cr (III) removal from wastewater [99]. Gupta and colleagues have also determined the role of SWCNTs (Single-walled carbon nanotubes) and MWCNTs (Multi-walled carbon nanotubes) inefficient removal of Cr(VI) ions from wastewater under different experimental conditions including pH, contact time, initial Cr(VI) ions concentration and adsorption capacity of adsorbent materials in the presence of competing for anion such as sulfate ions [100]. They demonstrated the vital role of competing anions and pH as fighting for sulfate anions hindered the\nadsorption of Cr(VI) ions on the CNT's adsorption sites. SWCNTs and MWCNTs showed their maximum adsorption potential at an optimum pH of 2.5.\nTseng et al. [101] have reported the enhanced adsorption efficiency of multi-walled carbon nanotubes by functionalizing them with ionic liquids. In contrast, Huang et al. have introduced magnetic properties to MWCNTs to improve their adsorption efficiency for the effective removal of Cr ions [102]. Ionic liquids provided the interesting electrostatic interactions between quaternary ammonium cations and oxygencontaining carboxyl and hydroxy groups present on the surface of MWCNTs. They hence acted as robust adsorption material to host the adsorption of Cr ions and other polluting metal ions from wastewater. The cation-π, anion-π and other electrostatic interactions amongst the MWCNTs-IL complex and chromium ions enhances the adsorption of chromium ions onto MWCNTs-IL complex and hence justifies the improved potential of modified CNTs in water remediation. On the other hand, magnetic CNTs can be easily dispersed in water and separated from water as well due to the presence of a magnet and hence poses like a supermodel for effective removal of heavy metal ions with no postcontamination which is an important criterion to be considered in water remediation techniques. Atieh has described the use of carbon nanotubes supported with activated carbon for efficient removal of chromium (VI) ions from wastewater [103]. He demonstrated that the adsorption efficiency of carbon nanotubes for Cr removal gets enhanced on the coating with activated carbon. Hence, it can be concluded that CNTs act as robust adsorbent material for the effective removal of heavy metal ions and find great potential in water remediation."

Activation treatment of carbon material results in the generation of high surface area with a large number of binding sites that facilitate adsorbent to interact with different species, including metal ions. Activated carbon composition comprises 80 % of carbon material with 20 % of other oxygen or nitrogen-containing species that get introduced to content while the activation process [105]. AC usually binds to chemical moieties by π-π interactions; however, various modifications, including acidic/primary and other treatment, results in stronger binding capacity of its. Metal impregnated ACs have shown improved efficiency towards the removal of heavy metal ions and other contaminants from wastewater by offering more adsorption sites to these species [106]. The metal impregnation of ACs can be easily achieved either by adsorption of pre-prepared metal nanoparticles onto ACs or by reduction of metal salt solution [106]."

      "text" : "Although the adsorption by AC is the most current technology for pollutant removal, it has a disadvantage of the high application cost. This can be overcome by preparing activated carbon from natural biomass and modifying it for better removal efficiency [107]. Low-cost plant Prosopisspicigera L derived silver-impregnated carbon (SIC) and its precursor (un-impregnated) was designed, characterized, and investigated for the As (III) removal [108]. An increase in pH shows no regular trend for As removal, as two pH were obtained for maximum extraction of As at pH 4 and pH 10 for 98.2 mg/g and 207.5 mg/g, respectively. Under the acidic condition, oxidation of metallic Ag to Ag+ leads to the reaction between AsO3− and the formation of Ag3AsO3 precipitate adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent. However, under the alkaline conditions, H2AsO3− and HAsO32- also get adsorbed on the SIC surface and lead to an increase in adsorption capacity. Arsenic removal was found to increase with an increase in temperature, and 59.19 mg/g adsorption capacity was observed at 45 °C. The adsorption data\nwere found to follow the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and pseudosecond-order kinetics model.\nIn another work, activated carbon prepared from Shea cake was used for the removal of As from aqueous media [109]. The batch adsorption method was found to follow first-order kinetics and Langmuir adsorption model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 7.87 μg/g of As. Activated carbon was used with a maximum adsorption capacity of 2.18 mg/g for As removal from aqueous media [110]. Fazeli et al. have physio-chemically modified activated charcoal obtained from the walnut shell using phosphoric acid (5% v/v) and investigated for As removal [111]. This modification led to the improvement in the surface area of the adsorbent from 1067 to 1437 m2 g−1 and decreased the mean pore size from 3.28 to 2.08 nm. Equilibrium time was obtained within 3 min with 98 % removal efficiency for As in aqueous media. The adsorption isotherm was found to obey the Langmuir adsorption isotherm with a maximum adsorption capacity of 120 μg/g of As. It has been suggested that the introduction of high amounts of free carboxyl groups through acidification of adsorbents resulting in ample physical and chemical interactions to absorb As ions on the surface.\nCeria coated powdered activated carbon was used for the removal of As from aqueous media with a maximum adsorption capacity of 10.3 and 12. 2 mg/g for As(III) and As(V), respectively [112]. An increase in pH has not shown any variation in the As (III) removal percentage below pH 9.2 due to the lack of any electrostatic interaction between adsorbent and neutral H3AsO3 species. This strong interaction between As (III) and adsorbent is supposed to be quite applicable over a wide range of pH. For As(V), the highest removal was observed at pH 8 as it exists in the anionic form within the pH range of 4–10 [113]. The more negative nature of the arsenic species facilitates the higher adsorption on the positively charged adsorbent at pH 8 and hence the most top removal. Iron compounds have been widely explored for the removal of arsenic from the aqueous media [114–116]. Numerous studies are available for arsenic removal using iron impregnated activated charcoal/ carbon, which considerably improves its As adsorption tendency.\nRecently, Mn impregnated iron modified AC was developed by a simple and efficient method, characterized and investigated for the removal of arsenic (V) from aqueous solutions [117]. The presence of iron in activated charcoal increased the adsorption capacity to 11.05 mg/g from 4 mg/g for raw carbon, which was further found to enhance by 19.35 mg/g after incorporating Mn to the iron activated charcoal. Surface complex formation of As (V) at the specific aqueous arsenate/ Fe–Mn oxide interface was suggested to be the responsible mechanism for As (V) adsorption on the synthesized novel adsorbents. In a similar pattern of studies, the adsorption of As (III) on iron oxide coated granular activated charcoal has been studied [118]. The pH range of 7.5−9.5 was found to be suitable for maximum adsorption of As (III) as the initial concentration was found to decrease by 10 μg/L within 90 min of contact time from an initial level of 100 μg/L. The pH of zero point charge (pHzpc) for iron oxide coated granular activated charcoal was observed at pH 8.2. At pH above 8.2, the surface of adsorbent becomes positively charge that facilitates the adsorption of negatively charged As (III) species due to electrostatic interaction and hence high adsorption was observed.\nIron impregnated granular activated charcoal was used for the removal of As from water and to access the portioning behaviour of As under different conditions [119]. A range of ferric concentrations was used for the synthesis of iron impregnated activated carbon, which has shown 92−98% removal capacity for As (V) and 42−65% for as As (III). Langmuir adsorption isotherm has well fitted the adsorption data suggesting the adsorption capacity of 125 mg/g and 98.4 mg/g for As (V) and As (III), respectively, which was well explained based on pHdependent behaviour of Arsenic and adsorbent. Similarly, Yao et al. [120] have reported the As (V) removal studies using iron impregnated activated charcoal with 98 % removal capacity within 60 min of contact time in the pH range of 3.5−8."

      "heading" : "2.3.2. Removal of Cr ions",
      "text" : "In case of activated carbon (AC), several investigations have shown that the maximum removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions take place in acidic conditions probably due to the neutralization of negative charges on the surface of the adsorbents by excess hydrogen ions, thereby enabling the diffusion of hydrogen chromate ions (HCrO4−) and then subsequent adsorption [121]. In a recent study by Su et al., AC was modified with micro-sized geothite (mFeOOH) using a facile and cost-effective impregnation method for enhanced Cr(VI) removal from aqueous solutions via adsorption, reduction and co-precipitation mechanism with a maximum adsorption capacity of 28.1 mg/g as represented in Fig. 7 [122].\nHuang et al. [123] proposed three mechanisms (physical, electrostatic, and chemical redox reaction) for the removal of Cr (VI) by the chitosan/MWCNTs−COOH composite, as shown in Fig. 8. The first physical adsorption was due to the electrostatic interaction between anionic Cr (VI) and cationic amino and carboxylate groups at the\nsurface of the composite. Simultaneously, the chemical redox reaction occurred where Cr (VI) reduced to Cr (III), which further desorbed and released into the solution due to electrostatic repulsion. Finally, a second chemical redox reaction also occurred via the direct reduction of free Cr (VI) anionic species to Cr (III), where the later was subsequently adsorbed by the chitosan/MWCNTs−COOH composite. The maximum adsorption efficiency of Cr ion observed was 163 mg/g within 30 min at pH 2 using these composite materials.\nAzari et al. used the technique to modify ACs with bimetallic nanoparticles comprising zero-valent iron and silver for efficient removal of hexavalent chromium ions from aqueous solution. This modified bimetallic activated carbon nanocomposite act as magnetic adsorbent as well and showed enhanced potential in the removal of Cr(VI) [124]. ACs can also be functionalized with CNTs to enhance the adsorption efficiency for efficient removal of heavy metal ions and other contaminants from wastewater.

They compared the adsorption capacity of nanocomposites having different shapes such as tubular and spherical AC-CNT complexes and determined that tubular composite exhibits better adsorption potential rather than its spherical counterpart and hence showed improved efficiency in removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution [125]. Recently, a new kind of adsorbent is synthesized using waste sludge for efficient removal of Cr(VI) by adsorption on activated carbon [126]. These studies show that carbonaceous materials offer remarkable adsorption capabilities for efficient removal of chromium and other heavy metal ions and contribute effectively towards water remediation.\nThe adsorption capacities of different carbon nanomaterials for the removal of As and Cr ions from water samples have been tabulated in\nTable 2 and Table 3. The data reveals the impact of functionalization and modification on the adsorption tendency of nanocarbon materials to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions."

      "text" : "Carbon nanospheres have been prepared by the spray pyrolysis method and used to remove As and Se ions from various water samples (deionized, canal, and well water) through adsorption mechanism [133]. The microporous nanospheres exhibited useful adsorption tendency due to primary functional groups present on the surface and high surface-volume ratio. Venkateswarlu et al. developed an economic graphene oxide like 2D carbon flake material (2D-CF) using waste onion sheathing and then modified it with magnetite nanoparticles for the removal of As(III) from water [134]. The adsorption capacity of bioinspired nanocomposite material was 57.47 mg/g with pseudosecond-order kinetics. The mechanism of As (III) adsorption has been demonstrated in Fig. 9.\nGe et al. have established the effective removal of arsenite (adsorption capacity: 103.4 mg/g), and arsenate (adsorption capacity: 172.9 mg/g) ions from the aqueous solution using β-FeOOH nanorods modified 3D carbon foams [135]. The abundant active sites, presence of hydroxyl groups, and hierarchical porous structure of nanostructure help in the effective binding of As ions. Fullerenes extracted soot modified with ethylenediamine has also been developed for adsorption\nof Cr(VI) ions from aqueous solution [136]. Pathan et al. reported the synthesis of nanoporous carbon structures by pyrolysis of grass, and this acid-functionalized porous nanocarbon was used for the removal of Cr (VI) ions. Magnetic carbon particles (MCPs) and magnetic carbon fibers (MCFs) were also prepared by different methods to study the effect of morphology on the adsorption process. MCFs showed three times better adsorption capacity (43.17 mg/g) as compared to MCPs (15.88 mg/g) for the removal of Cr(VI) ions at pH 1 [137]. This is ascribed to more active sites in the fibrillar sample, and their mechanism of removal has been given in Fig. 10.\nThe nano-hydrogels based on feedstock has also been developed as renewable bio-based materials for As removal applications [138]. Calixarenes based nanomaterials have also been developed for effective removal of As and Cr ions. Nanofibres of calixarene derivatives supported on polymeric (polyacrylonitrile) material were prepared by the electrospinning method [139]. The nanofibre mats exhibited excellent adsorption capacity for chromate anion in aqueous solution. Magnetite modified calixarene nanomaterials have also been developed for the removal of arsenate and dichromate from the aqueous solution [140]. The electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding play an essential role in the adsorption process. The development of newer carbon-based nanomaterials provides a unique platform for the water remediation process by effectively removing As and Cr ions from the aqueous solution.\nRahman et al. have developed new nanocomposites fabricated electrode with polyaniline/graphene/carbon nanotubes (PANI/G/ CNTs) nanostructures for selective sensing of 4-aminophenol by the electrochemical method [141]. The potential of immiscible polymer bends in membrane development for separation applications has also been analyzed, and the role of surface modification and precise poresize distribution on separation techniques have also been studied [142].\nThe significant challenge to develop carbon nanostructure is the use of costly and harmful chemicals. Gaddam et al. addressed this issue by developing carbon nanomaterials derived from camphor for the separation of heavy metals [143]. Shivaprasad et al. have studied the removal of fluorine from drinking water using nano alumia [144]. Satapathi et al. developed an eco-friendly multimodal nano-based sensor which has magnetic and fluorescent components and exhibited excellent detection and removal efficiency for mercury ions from the water with significant low detection limits [145].\nMa et al. developed magnesium oxide-based different nanostructures such as nanoflowers and nano-wires [146]. The nanowires of magnesium oxide showed promising removal tendency for arsenate and phosphates from the water. The electrostatic interaction was considered to be responsible for the adsorption process. Sharma et al. reported the efficient removal of arsenic (III) from water using nano tin ferrous oxide modified graphene oxide sheets with a sorption capacity of 105 mg/g [147]. The pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetics was followed, and the new developed nanomaterial obeyed Langmuir isotherm.\nManish et al. elaborated on the synthetic procedures for the development of carbon nanodots with tunable emission tendencies and high luminescence. The applications of carbon nanodots in the detection of different metal ions have also been discussed [148]. The carbonaceous material also acts as a stabilizing agent for nanostructures. Dutta et al. reported the synthesis of silver bio-nano composite using citric acid as a reducing agent and chitosan as a stabilizer [149]. They examined the size-dependent antibacterial activity of these nanosilver structures. Zhao et al. reported the effective removal of chromium (VI) ions along with Rhodamine B and methylene blue dyes using hydrothermally fabricated TiO2-MoO3 nanomaterials [150].\nBecause of the burning issue for the removal of two toxic metals, Cr and As from wastewater, tremendous research data and reviews are available. However, limited patents are found recently. In a patent, the investigators claimed to modify a filter using gravity and dip-coating method involving a polymer-carbon based nanocomposite (poly-Nvinyl carbazole/ graphene/graphene oxide) to significantly improve the\nefficiency of filtration, separation, and remediation of a broad range of pollutants [151]. In another patent, carbon-magnetite nanocomposites have been developed using renewable resources for the removal of arsenic from water [152]."

      "text" : "Due to the porosity, high adsorption capacity, chemical inertness, and environment-friendly nature, various nanomaterials, including\ncarbon-based materials (activated carbon) are most widely used as an adsorbent for the remediation of effluent water treatment. However, their high cost, agglomeration tendency, and restriction to recycle and reuse limit their use on a large scale [153,154]. Therefore, to overcome these shortcomings, efforts have been made to load carbon nanoparticles on the surface of natural minerals (like, attapulgite, illite, palygorskite, montmorillonite, etc.) to obtain carbon nanocomposites with enhanced surface activity than singel carbon nanomaterial [155]. Nanocomposite, a multiphase solid material, offers multifunctionality,\nwhich is generally not found in conventional materials [156]. The enhanced properties of polymer/carbon nanocomposites as compared to traditional composite materials depends upon the quality of dispersion, processing methods, loading of the particles, aspect ratio of the nanoparticles, modification of the surfaces of nanoparticles, compatibility of particle and host polymer, size of particles, etc.\nNanocomposites, as nano adsorbents, offer high sorption efficiency and rapid process kinetics due to their large specific surface area, poresize distribution, and easily accessible sorption sites [157,158]. The presence of non-metallic minerals provides enhancement of oxygencontaining functional groups on the surface of carbon nanocomposites with improved capacity for adsorption/ separation of pollutants/heavy metals from the wastewater with cost-effectiveness. Recently, Sun et al. have reported efficient removal of Cr VI (142.8 mg/g) from wastewater using carboxyl-rich carbon nanocomposite based on natural diatomite. In this study, diatomite has been selected for its high ion exchange capacity, availability of abundant adsorption sites, high porosity, strong permeability, and chemical inertness. The synthesized carboxyl abundant carbon-based nanocomposites were free from the agglomeration problem with improved adsorption capacity and reduced cost. The material can be recycled and reused effectively up to four times after washing with alkali [155]. It is reported that polypyrrole/Fe3O4 nanocomposite is an excellent adsorbent for the removal of Cr(VI) from wastewater [155]. Salam et al. prepared multi-walled CNTs/chitosan nanocomposite by sonicating the chitosan and CNTs suspension and then cross-linking them with glutaraldehyde for efficient removal of metal ions [159]. Hayati et al. [160] have synthesized CNT coated polyamidoamine dendrimer nanocomposite for adsorption of As (III), in a fixed-bed system with maximum uptake efficiency of 432 mg/g. Gupta et al. designed the SWCNTs-polysulfone nanocomposite based membrane with reduced pore size, smoother surface and higher rejection capacity for the removal of 96.8 % Cr(VI), and 87.6 % As(III) metal ions [161]. In another study, Bankole et al. used poly hydroxybutyrate functionalized carbon nanotubes (PHB-CNTs), a composite of biodegradable and biocompatible polymer with carbon nanotubes with low toxicity, ease of production, and high availability. The author has suggested that the metal adsorption phenomenon is not only influenced by the surface area but indirectly by composite’s water holding capacity and attached functionality. Finally, the metal treated (PHB-CNTs) composite as adsorbate meets the water quality standard for re-use, either for industrial or agricultural (irrigation) activities [162].\nDue to the complex nature of Cr(VI)-adsorbent interactions mentioned earlier, researchers have found ways to capitalize on the different synergies by producing adsorbents that address two or more mechanisms [163]. Graphene and GO/RGO-based materials have been extensively reported to remove heavy metals from wastewater [17,164]. Ali et al. [46] published a detailed survey of GO in its pristine and modified form for the removal of heavy metals and organic pollutants. The synergism of CNT with GO in the way of nanocomposites at a commercial level is limited because of the formation of stable and concentrated dispersion of CNTs and GO as starting material, especially in the water system beyond (0.01 to 0.1 %), even in the presence of surfactants which is undesirable at times [165]. Efforts have been made to increase the water solubility of GO and CNT by modification with (resol-type phenol-formaldehyde resins) in an alkaline medium, with improved compatibility and distribution characteristics [166].\nAn important property of the carbonaceous nanomaterials as adsorbent should be their ability to reuse after the regeneration process. These nanomaterials should possess a high adsorption capacity, with a good desorption property, which considerably reduces the total cost of the adsorbent. To reuse the metal adsorbed carbonaceous nanomaterials, an efficient methodology is required for efficient extraction/ removal of the metals so that the desired material can be utilized for further metal adsorption cycles. These carbon nanomaterials can be reused after washing with alkali solutions. Budimirovic et al. have reported the removal of various metal ions using functionalized MWCNTs\nand found pH-dependent desorption of As(V) after adsorption. About 30 % of As(V) is desorbed at pH 6.5. The sudden desorption increase occurs at pH>6.5,and reaches a value of 78 % at pH 10 [167]. The metal adsorbed carbon nanomaterials should meet the water quality standard for re-use, either for industrial or agricultural (irrigation) activities. Researchers have suggested that instead of chemically oxidized multiwalled CNTs, plasma-oxidized multiwalled CNTs may be used as sorbents for various metals. Compared with chemically oxidized CNTs, plasma-oxidized tubes showed an increased sorption capacity, mainly due to the addition of oxygen-containing functional groups to the CNT surface. The study of the regeneration process showed that the metal ions are easily desorbed from the plasma-oxidized CNTs [168].\nThe toxicity of carbon nanotubes is a controversial topic nowadays. Even after various in vitro and in vivo studies, the exact defined cause of CNT toxicity is not yet fully understood. It has been reported that the accumulation of CNT and subsequently generated reactive oxygen species could be the most probable cause of CNT toxicity. However, to confirm the toxicity of CNT’s, a vast study is required taking into consideration the physio-chemical parameters like CNTs length, diameters, mass/particle/concentration, defective/reactive sites, surface functionalization/absorption, aggregation/agglomeration states, metallic impurities, etc. [169] [170]\n2.6. Cost-benefit analysis\nCarbon-based nanomaterials have been extensively explored for their enhanced removal efficiency of heavy metals in water due to their exceptional physiochemical properties. Despite various advantages offered by the carbon-based nanomaterials (CNTs, Graphene, GO, RGO) for the removal of pollutants/ heavy metals from wastewater, they are still associated with various drawbacks. Some certain issues and challenges need to be addressed for the successful employment of these carbon-based nanomaterials at a large scale for the removal of heavy metals. Most of the research using these nanomaterials or heavy metal removal is at their preliminary stage and required extensive research for practical application. High manufacture and modification cost, difficulty in separation after adsorption of pollutants, high treatment cost of pollutant/heavy metal adsorbed nanomaterials, regeneration, recycling, and toxicity of these nanomaterials are the crucial matters of top consideration [171]. Primarily, the synthesis and operational cost of the nanomaterials need to be minimized and optimized from the economic point of view. Tremendous efforts for the large scale production of these nanomaterials, using green research methodology, are required for their application in the treatment of actual industrial wastewater, irrespective of the available laboratory level research data. The toxicity and biocompatibility of these carbonaceous nanomaterials for the environment and human beings should be abundantly explored. From the economic point of view, methods to improve metal removal efficiency by overcoming their agglomeration tendency, regeneration, reuse, and recycling of the heavy metal adsorbed carbon nanomaterials is highly mandatory and required extensive research for the development [171]."

      "text" : "The high concentration of heavy metals, in particular, arsenic and chromium in water bodies due to natural and anthropogenic routes, has aroused a great concern worldwide. Their presence in the environment in more than the recommended values of the World Health Organization in most of the parts of the world necessitates the need for a very selective, economical and efficient system to remove them from water. The toxicity of arsenic includes abdominal pain, watery diarrhea with blood, encephalopathy, skin thickening and darkening, heart disease, and numbness. Its high concentration in the body is also linked to affect the gut microflora and thereby could lead to metabolism and digestion alarms accompanied with several kinds of cancer and other diseases [172]. The intake of a high percentage of chromium ions is also\nknown to cause bronchial carcinomas [173]. The poisoning of chromium ions causes dermatitis, eczematous skin effects, hepatocellular deficiency, mucous membrane ulceration, nasal septum perforation, allergic asthmatic problems, gastro-enteritis, and renal oligo anuric deficiency problem [173]. Therefore, there is a social urge to remove and arsenic and chromium ions from water through adsorption and thereby prevent the main entry route of heavy metals into the physiological system.\nThe carbonaceous nanomaterials have been reported with remarkable adsorption capabilities at the laboratory scale. However, for the actual treatment of wastewater, these nanomaterials are still facing many challenges that need to be resolved for practical application to remove pollutants, mainly, As and Cr like heavy metals. Simple, costeffective, and extensive scale fabrication methods are required for the development of carbonaceous nanomaterials for a variety of applications. The natural recovery and reusability of these materials could make the process cost-effective and sustainable. However, their modifications with magnetic nanoparticles have been performed for their magnetic separation; the processing at the industrial level need to be analyzed for commercialization. Agglomeration of carbonaceous nanomaterials (like CNT and GO) in aqueous media is one of the major hindrances in pollutant removal from wastewater, which results in a lack of surface area and reduction in the number of active sites. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the surface modification of these nanomaterials for efficient adsorption, selection, and affinity for As and Cr ions. Despite the exceptional properties of CNTs and other carbon nanostructures, the development and applications of carbon materials are mainly limited by their low volume of production, low removal efficiency, limited selectivity, and high cost [174]. Also, carbon nanomaterials cannot be used alone without any supporting medium [175]. The toxicity of various carbonaceous nanomaterials needs to be investigated on an urgent basis for human beings, living things, and the environment. CNTs have been a growing concern since their discovery in the early 90 s. Recently, many reports have come up regarding health concerns [176,177]. Besides this, the pH of the water sample is an essential parameter for the effective removal of As and Cr by functionalized carbon nanostructures. For actual wastewater treatment, synthesis, and surface modification of the carbonaceous materials are required to be scaled up, which could be costly in some cases. Disposal of pollutant adsorbed carbonaceous nanomaterials need attention so that the accumulation of second-generation waste materials can be avoided.\nHowever, these limitations can be addressed methodically, and the usefulness of carbonaceous nanomaterials can be improved for real-life applications. The modification of nano-carbons with biomaterials and their bio-inspired synthesis opens a new avenue in the development of green and economical materials where large scale production can effectively be carried out for the removal of toxic As and Cr ions from real industrial waste. The combined remediation approach involving redox and adsorption mechanism by carbon nanomaterials modified by redoxactive metals or organic moieties is the future of new generation materials for converting more toxic metal ions into its less deadly form such as As(V) turns to As(III), and Cr(VI) changes to Cr(III), followed by adsorption on the porous carbon nanomaterials. The functionalization to introduce selectivity in hybrid carbon nanostructures progresses their structural and chemical aspects, developing the promising potential for the pollutants and heavy metal removal from the wastewater system."

      "text" : "The water pollution by heavy metals like As and Cr is getting increased day-by-day and causing grave concern to aquatic and human life due to their inability to self-purification, bio-accumulative effect, chemical toxicity, and smooth migration and transformation. Carbonaceous materials show promising potential to remove As and Cr\nions from wastewater due to their unique structural and chemical properties. The nano-carbon materials such as CNTs (SWCNTs and MWCNTs), graphene oxide, and activated carbon possess incredibly high surface area and porosity, which is responsible for faster adsorption rate of As and Cr ions from aqueous solution. Carbon nanomaterials can be synthesized and modified by simple processes to introduce endowed selectivity, tunability, and performances. These materials can penetrate deeper and thus can treat water/wastewater, which is generally not possible by conventional technologies. Graphene, carbon nanotubes, and activated carbon-based materials are the most widely developed carbon nanostructures for their application in heavy metals, As and Cr removal from water bodies. Nowadays, their bio-based modifications and chemical-free modification techniques are growing to provide a green solution to the water pollution problem. The hybrid materials with a coupled mechanistic approach involving redox and adsorption techniques are producing astonishing results. They have the potential to take this nanotechnological approach to the next level of commercial growth. The pH and nature of functional groups present on carbon nanomaterials are essential parameters for the success of designed functional nanomaterials as a promising candidate for the potential removal of As and Cr ions via adsorption mechanism. There is an urgent need to address all the challenges for the revolution of carbon nanomaterials from laboratory-scale research to the commercial level platform. The promising future of carbon nanostructures may provide an ultimate solution to the water pollution problem by effectively removing toxic heavy metals.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThere is no conflict of interest."

Heavy metals accumulated in soil and water bodies enter into the food chain, and their hazardous effects on human health have been investigated extensively. Chromium and arsenic represent the toxic metals widely present in wastewater, and their high concentrations cause a life-threatening impact on human health. Many nano adsorbents have been developed to reduce the level of Cr and As ions from wastewater; however, their efficiencies are low. Recently, various carbonaceous nanomaterials have been developed with extraordinary and tunable physical-chemical properties to exhibit outstanding adsorption efficacy for heavy metals. The application of various carbonaceous nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and chemically modified forms and modifications have been discussed in detail in the present review article for the removal of Cr and As ions from wastewater.",
