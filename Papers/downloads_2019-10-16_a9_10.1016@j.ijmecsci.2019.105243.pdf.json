Ghalambaz; Email: mohammad.ghalambaz@tdtu.edu.vn) Abstract The natural convection of a Nano Encapsulated Phase Change Materials (NEPCMs) suspension in a cavity with a hot wall having a time-periodic temperature is investigated. The top and bottom walls of the enclosure are insulated, the right side wall is kept at a constant temperature of Tc while the left side wall is considered as hot wall and is subjected to a time-periodic temperature. The NEPCM consist of capsules with phase change material PCM in their core. The phase change core of the capsules is covered by a shell. During the fusion or the solidification of the core, the phase change will absorb or release heat in the surrounding, when the temperature is close to the PCM fusion temperature. The partial differential equations governing the flow and heat transfer in the enclosure are formulated in the dimensionless form, and affective key dimensionless numbers and parameters are introduced. The finite element method is used to solve the governing equations. The accuracy of the results is verified by comparison to the benchmark solutions available in the literature. The average Nusselt number in the enclosure, as an indicator of the heat transfer performance, is analyzed. It is shown that the average Nusselt\nnumber in the enclosure follows a periodic variation with the same frequency of the temperature of the hot wall and with an amplitude that varies correspondingly with the temperature amplitude. The heat transfer in the cavity is enhanced when a higher fraction of the NEPCM is used, and a fraction of 5% provides the highest heat transfer. Increasing the volume fraction of nanoparticles from 2.5% to 5% enhanced the average Nusselt number by 21% and the maximum value of Nusselt number by 18.5%. The fusion temperature of nanocapsules is an important parameter affecting the thermal performance of the enclosure, mainly, when the fusion temperature is notably different from cold or hot-wall temperatures.\nKeywords: Nano-encapsulated phase change materials (NEPCMs); Fusion temperature; timeperiodic temperature boundary condition; Natural convection."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Phase change materials (PCM) have been an active research area in recent years, due to their\nuse in thermal storage applications. Such applications include, among others, the thermal performance of buildings [1], domestic air-conditioning systems [2], and electronic devices and space instruments [3]. The main advantage of PCMs is their large latent heat for a relatively small temperature difference and volume change. Heat storage or release occurs at a certain fusion temperature when the PCM undergo melting or solidification, respectively. However, despite the ability of PCMs to store large amounts of energy, these materials are not very efficient in terms of heat transfer due to their low thermal conductivity. Thus, many techniques have been developed to enhance the heat transfer of PCM, such as the use of metallic fins [4, 5] or porous media [6-8], which are some of the techniques, utilized for PCM heat transfer enhancement.\nIn devices and systems subject to temperature rise or to temperature gradients, like computer\nchipsets, laser alignment systems, and detectors needing temperature control, internal thermal\nstresses can develop inside the system due to the disparity of thermal expansion coefficient between different materials. In this context, encapsulation of PCM presents an effective method to enhance the performance of the working fluids and to better control of the system temperature.\nEncapsulation consists of using capsules with a shell-core structure, where the core is made\nof PCM [9]. For instance, Fang et al. [10] used formaldehyde as a shell and n-tetradecane as a core and. Qiu et al. [11] synthesized capsules with n-octadecane as a core encapsulated in MMApolymer shell. Based on the size of the particles, the terms nano-encapsulation and microencapsulation are often used [12, 13]. Nano-Encapsulated Phase Change Materials (NEPCMs) dispersed in fluids can, therefore, be considered as nanofluids. It is worth noting that many studies considered the addition of nanoparticles to PCM for heat transfer enhancement [1, 14, 15]. In the presence of such nano-additives, the acronym NEPCM means Nano-Enhanced Phase Change Materials [14, 16-18], which is different from the technique considered in the present study.\nNatural convection of nanofluids, i.e., fluids comprising suspensions of nanoparticles, in\ncavities and enclosures have been widely investigated. Suspensions of uniform solid particles without phase change in cavities with different configurations, such as wavy walled cavities [19, 20], cavities with hot wall obstacles [21] and porous enclosures [22, 23] have been considered. Other studies addressed the effects of magnetic fields [24] and conjugate heat transfer [25] on the natural convection of the nanofluid in the enclosure. Taking phase change of NEPCM into account, most of the studies focused on forced convection in channels or tubes. For instance, [26] performed a numerical study of the heat transfer enhancement in microtube heat sinks by PCM encapsulation and concluded that while the presence of the NEPCM substantially improved the fluid cooling power, it leads to a significant pressure drop in the tube. Seyf et al. [27]\ninvestigated the flow and heat transfer of a slurry of nano-encapsulated octadecane past a square cylinder numerically and found a remarkable enhancement of the heat transfer characteristics of the slurry with respect to the base fluid. Ho et al. [28] conducted experiments to investigate the effect of using water-based microencapsulated PCM on heat transfer in a minichannel. They observed that heat transfer can be enhanced or deteriorate by the presence of the PCM capsules depending on various parameters like the flow rate and the latent-sensible heat ratio. Other experiments [29, 30] used Alumina nanoparticles and/or slurries of microencapsulated PCM in circular tubes [29] and minichannels [30]. Their results also indicated that heat transfer performance is affected by different parameters, such as the flow rate and the heating location.\nOn the other hand, works dealing with the natural convection of NEPCM suspensions have\nbeen very limited. In a recent study [31], we investigated the steady natural convective flow of NEPCM in a square cavity with two differentially-heated isothermal vertical walls and found that the heat transfer enhancement depends greatly on the fusion temperature of the NEPCM. In practice, it is very possible that the temperature of the walls fluctuates with time and, thus, the assumption of isothermal walls cannot be valid. The presence of an unsteady time-periodic heat transfer can contribute to the thermal charging/discharging capability of NEPCMs and provide a different trend of behavior rather than the steady-state case which was investigated in [31]. The present research aims to examine the case of a cavity with a time-dependent temperature boundary condition. For the sake of simplicity, the temperature is assumed to be time-periodic."

      "text" : "Highly non-linear equations describing the flow and temperature fields are solved by using\nthe finite element method. The utilized method can be found in details in [37]. The computational domain is discretized using a structured mesh consisting of N×N rectangular elements. The mesh is refined near the walls and gradually coarsened towards the domain center. The selection of an adequate time step is very important in phase change heat transfer. Hence, in the present study, the time step is controlled automatically using a free time-step Backward Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) [38]. A grid independence test was performed to determine the optimal number of elements for the numerical computations. The test was done for ϕ = 0.05, Ste = 0.2, Ra = 10 6 , θf = 0.25, f = 0.05, and A = 1. Three grids were considered: 50×50, 100×100 and 150×150. The variation of the non-dimensional horizontal velocity U and the nondimensional temperature along the central line of the domain (X = 0.5), at τ = 2τp, for the three grids is plotted in Fig. 2. It is shown that varying the grid size has minimal impact on the results. It was then decided to use a 100×100 grid in the computations, as it shows a good compromise\nbetween good numerical precision and low computational cost. Besides, to verify the numerical model for suspension simulations comprising NEPCMs particles, initial calculations are done and evaluated with the works conducted in [39-41].\nTuran et al. [39] investigated the steady natural convection in a cavity when the top and\nbottom walls were insulated, and the side walls were at a constant temperature. The right and the left walls were at hot and cold temperatures, respectively. For a case of Newtonian fluid with Pr = 1000 and Ra = 10 5 , a comparison between the isotherms of the present study and those of [39] is reported in Fig.3. As seen, the results are in excellent agreement.\nAs a transient heat transfer case, a comparison with the results of Kalabin et al. [41] in\nperformed in Fig. 4. Kalabin et al. [41] studied an unsteady natural convection heat transfer in a square cavity with the adiabatic horizontal walls. A time-periodic temperature varying by sinusoidal law about the average value of Tc was applied to the left vertical wall. The other sidewall was at an isothermal temperature of Tc. The average Nusselt number of the current study with that given in [41] is compared when Ra = 2×10 5 , Pr = 1, and f = 20π. As shown in Fig. 4, the results of the current work are in good agreement with Kalabin et al. [41]. In another verification, a comparison of the average Nusselt number for different values of the volume fraction , obtained by the present work and the solution of Kahveci et al. [40] is carried out. The left and right of the enclosure investigated by Kahveci et al. [40] were maintained at the higher and lower temperatures, while the other walls were perfectly insulated. The thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity numbers for the comparison are 3.3 and 2.88, respectively. As found clearly from Table 2, the outcomes of the employed code match the outcomes presented by Kahveci et al. [40].

      "text" : "temperature of the cold wall is fixed at θc = 0 , while that of the hot wall is following the periodic variation θ = 1+ Asin(fτ).\nThe default values of the main parameters are ϕ = 0.05, Ste = 0.2, Ra = 10 6 , θf = 0.25, δ =\n0.05, f = 0.05, and A = 1. In the following, unless stated otherwise, the results are reported for these default values. In order to investigate the effect of a specific parameter on the heat transfer inside the cavity, its value will be varied in a defined range, while the other parameters will keep their default values.\ncase of a constant hot wall temperature (f = 0 or A = 0) is equal to the average Nusselt number Nua in the case where and . Increasing the frequency of the oscillations does not have any effect on the amplitude of Nua,τ. However, it confirms that the frequency of variation of Nua,τ is always equal to that of the hot wall temperature. On the other side, increasing A does not change Nua but it increases the amplitude of Nua,τ. These results indicate that the frequency of variation of the heat transfer intensity in the cavity always follows the frequency of the timeperiodic temperature. A temperature with a higher amplitude will lead to an increased heat transfer when the temperature is maximum. It is worth noting that for A = 1.5 (as shown in Fig. 6), at τ = 2.75 τp, Nua,τ has a negative value. In fact, the temperature of the hot wall at this instant is equal to θ = -0.5, which is lower than θc, thus leading to a negative heat transfer rate as the hot wall will behave as the cold one and vice versa. Anyway, in all the cases, the average value Nua will always be the same.\nFig. 6. Variation of Nua,τ as a function of time for A = 0.5, A = 1 and A = 1.5, and for various values of f\nThe variation of Nua,τ as a function of time for different values of the nanoparticles\n(NEPCMs) volume fraction ϕ is illustrated in Fig. 8a. It is shown that a higher value of ϕ increases the average Nusselt number Nua as well as the amplitude of Nua,τ. In the case of a pure fluid (ϕ = 0), Nua,τ is varying periodically around the average value Nua = 9.19, with a maximum of 22.36. Increasing ϕ to 0.025 and 0.05 increases Nua respectively to 12.45 and 15.15 (21% enhancement) and the maximum values of Nusselt to 29.12 and 34.51 (18.5% enhancement). An increase of the volume fraction of the NEPCM would lead to higher latent heat storage and consequently would enhance the heat transfer in the enclosure. Fig. 8.b shows that the Normalized average Nusselt number reaches its maximal value for ϕ = 0.05. This\nmeans that the optimal value of the NEPCM particles volume fraction is 5%, as it is the maximum value in the range that corresponds to dilute suspensions, thus respecting the assumptions of the study.\nFig. 8. (a) Time variation of Nua,τ for different values of the volume concentration ϕ. (b) Variation of the Normalized average Nusselt number NNuϕ=0 as a function of ϕ.\nFig. 9 shows the variation of Nua,τ as a function of time for Ra = 10 5 , 10 6 and 10 7 . It is\nshown that increasing the value of Ra increases substantially the amplitude of Nua,τ and the average Nusselt number Nua. Indeed, Ra expresses heat transfer in natural convection, and increasing its magnitude will thus enhance the heat transfer rate in the enclosure.\nFig. 9. Time variation of Nua,τ as a function of time for different values of Ra\nThe impact of Stefan number Ste and the fusion temperature θf and on the rate of heat\ntransfer is depicted in Fig. 10. For all the values of Ste, varying θf in the range [0, 0.75] shows that increasing θf changes the magnitude of Nua,τ slightly. To further illustrate the effect of θf and Ste, the variation of Nua,τ as a function of θf for different values of Ste is plotted in Fig. 11. It should be noted that a decrease of Ste indicates a rise of the PCM core latent heat, and thus, an increase of the heat storage of the NEPCM particles.\nFig. 10. Time variation of Nua,τ as a function of time for different values of θf and Ste\nθf is comprised in the interval [0.25θmax, 0.75θmax]. When Ste → ∞, Nua,τ does not vary as no phase change is occurring. The Normalized Nusselt number is plotted as a function of Ste for different values of θf in Fig. 12. It is shown that when the fusion temperature θf is close to the temperature of one of the walls, the value of remains equal to 1. When θf deviates from the walls temperature, increases, mostly for small values of Ste. This result confirms the fact that the phase change of the PCM cores is an essential factor in heat transfer enhancement. Nonetheless, the phase change of NEPMCs is only effective when the fusion temperature is close to the temperature of the walls, and the value of Ste should be kept small.\nFig. 12. Variation of as a function of Ste for different values of θf\nFigs. 13 and 14 show respectively the isotherm and the heat capacity ratio (Cr) contours for\nθf = 0.25 and θf = 0.5.

The isotherm θ = 0.5 follows a very similar variation, but it starts further from the cold wall and ends closer to the hot wall, while its horizontal part is directed towards the center. It is clear that the pattern of the isotherms is slightly affected by the fusion temperature θf. However, as the melting and solidification of the NEPCM core occurs when the temperature is close to θf, this means that increasing θf would move the zone of the phase change\ntowards the center of the cavity and closer to the hot wall. This observation is confirmed by looking at the heat capacity ratio Cr depicted in Fig. 14, where the yellow ribbon-shaped zone represents the phase change region. At τ = 2.25τp, the isotherm θ = 0.25 starts at the top of the cold wall with a prolongation in the vicinity of the bottom wall. The shape of the isotherm θ = 0.5 is similar to the case τ = 2τp. The pattern of the isotherm contours is also not affected by the variation of θf. Nonetheless, compared to the case τ = 2τp, the contours move towards the bottom wall, due to the fact that the temperature of the hot wall has doubled. In the two cases, the zone of phase change moves upwards when θf is increased. Moreover, the ribbon-shaped zone of Cr is always wider in the center of the cavity, since the temperature gradients are larger near the walls. In all cases, the maximum value of Cr is 8.82.\nFig. 13.

Summary and conclusion:\nNatural convective flow and heat transfer of a dilute NEPCM suspension in a cavity with\ntime-periodic temperature boundary condition are investigated. An adiabatic boundary condition is imposed on the top and bottom walls, while one of the side walls is kept at a constant temperature and considered as a cold wall. The temperature of the hot wall oscillating around a mean value higher than the temperature of the cold wall. Due to temperature difference, a buoyancy-driven flow is created in the cavity. The equations governing flow and heat transfer inside the cavity are formulated in the dimensionless form. The latent heat released and absorbed during the phase change by the NEPCM is included in the equations. The governing equations are solved by means of the finite element method with adequate boundary conditions. The main parameter that is measured to assess heat transfer inside the cavity is the average Nusselt number Nua,τ, of which the variation is tracked as a function of time. Various values of the dimensionless parameters affecting the flow and heat transfer behaviors in the cavity are considered. The main results of the study can be summarized as follows:\nIn the case of time-periodic temperature boundary condition, the Nusselt number Nua,τ\nfollows the variation of the temperature. Nua,τ varies periodically around an average value Nua and has the same frequency as the temperature. An increase in the amplitude of the temperature increases the amplitude of Nua,τ, but the average Nua remains the same. Nua represents the value of Nusselt number in the case of a constant temperature boundary condition, i.e., when the amplitude of the temperature is zero.\nUsing a higher volume fraction of the NEPCM particles increases the Normalized\naverage Nusselt number NNuϕ=0 and the amplitude of Nua,τ, and, thus, enhances heat transfer in the enclosure. The optimal value of ϕ is 0.05, which improves heat transfer while respecting the condition of dilute suspension. Ra is another parameter which when increased, enhances heat transfer by increasing Nua.\nIncreasing the latent heat of the PCM core of the NEPCM particles (by decreasing the value\nof Stefan number Ste) further enhances heat transfer in the cavity by increasing the values of Nua,τ under the same temperature conditions. Varying the fusion temperature of the PCM core also affects heat transfer. In fact, using fusion temperature close to the temperature of the cold wall or to the maximum temperature θmax of the hot wall reduces the heat transfer. The heat transfer is optimal when the fusion temperature is in the range [0.25 θmax, 0.75θmax].\nIn the present study, the heat transfer and fluid flow of a cavity with a constant and time-\nperiodic wall temperature are investigated. The Nusselt number is investigated as the charasterestic parameter for wall temperature. There are many applications that the cavity is subject to a constant or variable heat flux instead of constant wall temperature. As the nanocapsules contribute to temperature control of the cavity by their latent heat, the investigation\nof the effect of nano-capsulses on the temperature distribution of a cavity wall subject to a constant or variable wall heat flux can be investigated in future studies.\nconflict of interest\nThe authors clarify that there is no conflict of interest for report."
