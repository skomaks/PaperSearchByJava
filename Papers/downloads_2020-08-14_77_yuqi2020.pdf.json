It was observed that HNO prefers to be adsorbed on the cage oxygen atom with −0.70 eV adsorption energy. This process of adsorption remarkably decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap (Eg) of the cage from 3.91 to 1.41 eV. The time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) indicates a high intensity peak in 390.29 nm in the steadiest complexes of HNO with Al12N12. The alteration in electronic attributes of the Al12N12 nanocage on adsorption of HNO is enough to consider it a potential sensor for the detection of HNO.

      "text" : "Aluminum nitride has a combination of electronic and physical attributes and exists in tubular, spherical, and planer forms. All members of this nitride are semiconductor materials with large band-gap and have many excellent attributes [1]. Following the synthesis of fullerenes by Li et al. [2], numerous works have been done to investigate\nthe attributes of fullerene-like cages made of non-carbon atoms owing to their superior physical and chemical attributes [3,4]. Because of the prominent chemical and physical attributes of fullerene-like cages constructed of non-carbon atoms, extensive research has been done to investigate their properties. However, group III-V fullerene-like tubular structures and cages have been the subject of intense research because of their large bandgaps. As a result, they provide optical low electron\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.inoche.2020.108069 Received 18 April 2020; Received in revised form 24 June 2020; Accepted 28 June 2020\n⁎ Corresponding author. ⁎⁎ Corresponding author.

Among these materials, nanocages have been an interesting structure for many studies because of their features such as their large bandgap, low electron dependency, and unique chemical and physical attributes [5–7]. Baei et al. [8] showed that the B12N12 nanocage is a potential effective absorbent for toxic pyridine adsorption in environmental systems. Also, Al12N12 nanocage was studied as a potential sensor for NO detection by Beheshtian et al [9]. Wu et al. [10], using ab initio calculations, studied stability and structures of (AlN)n fullerene-like cages (n = 2–41) and reported that Al12N12 is the steadiest nanocage among various types of (AlN)n nanocages. Also, AlN has attracted the attention of scientists because of its singular physical and chemical attributes in various fields such as microelectronic, materials, ceramic, and surface sciences [11]. So, several works showed the interaction of different gas molecules with AlN structures such as fullerenes, tubes, and (AlN)n nanocages [12–18]. Nitrosyl hydride (HNO) is a small molecule used in bacterial, atmospheric, and industrial processes [19]. HNO is an attractive molecule in chemistry regarding its numerous physiological efficacies in several biological processes such as neurological function regulation, vascular relaxation, and regulation of enzyme activity [20–25]. It has also been shown to increase the disruption of the blood-brain barrier [26] and induce the release of the calcitonin gene-related product in peptidergic [27] neurons. Also, HNO has been recognized as a drug treatment to reduce neuronal disruption, for example, during stroke [20]. In biology, it can be used as an inhibitor to prevent tumor growth [28]. Lopez et al. [29] have shown that HNO can inhibit glycolysis without affecting the thiol status of the cell. These observations indicate that HNO plays an important role in biology and medicine. Considering the importance of HNO detection, this research is allocated to investigate the possible usage of Al12N12 based sensors for HNO detection. So, DFT technique was utilized to avoid deeper insight about the adsorption of HNO on Al12N12 fullerene."

      "text" : "DFT computations at the (B3LYP-D) level (Becke’s three-parameter [30] exchange function using the Lee, Parr, and Yang correlation function [31]) with 6-31G* basis sets were done on the Al12N12 nanocage and HNO/Al12N12 complexes utilizing the GAMESS code [32]. By an experimental scattering term, the B3LYP function is incremented (B3LYP-D) to enhance the reliability in the computation of noncovalent interactions. Geometry optimization, density of states (DOS), and energies were computed for the prepared structures. Also the frequency computations for the optimized structures were computed at the (B3LYP-D) function with the 6-31G* basis set to determine the attendance of a local minimum. By studying various nano-structures, it was found that the calculations based on the B3LYP function could yield reliable results for the attributes of the electronic structure of nanostructures [33,34]. The adsorption energy (Ead) of HNO on the surface of Al12N12 for the optimized structures is obtained using the following equation:\n= +E E [E E ]ad HNO/Al12N12 Al12N12 HNO (1)\nwhere EHNO/Al12N12 is the whole energy of the complex of an absorbed HNO molecule on the Al12N12 nanocage. EAl12N12 and EHNO are the whole energy of the pristine Al12N12 and HNO molecule, respectively. The negative values of Ead exhibit that the adsorption is exothermic. The energy gap (Eg) of the optimized structures was obtained by the energy diversity between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Also, work function (Ð¤) of the intended structures and Fermi level energy (EFL) were computed."

      "text" : "In this study, a nanocage containing 12 nitrogen and 12 aluminum atoms was utilized to investigate the steadiest state of HNO adsorption on its surface. The optimized pristine cage of Al12N12 and its DOS are indicated in Fig. 1.\nIt was found that the geometry of this cage consists of six-four member rings having Th symmetry. There are two non-equivalent bonds of Al-N: the Al-N bond between the four-membered ring. It has a length of 1.78 Å while the Al-N bond in the four-membered ring has a length of 1.84 Å. Ionic bonding is dominant in the Al12N12 cage due to the large diversity in electronegativity between N and Al. The computed frequencies range from 155.84 to 943.96 cm−1, suggesting that the geometry is optimized on some ground states at some local levels of minimum energy. The energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest un-occupied molecular orbital (LUMO), Eg of Al12N12 nanocage is calculated to be about 3.93 eV, showing a semiconducting character. As shown in Fig. 2, the HOMO and LUMO of Al12N12 are localized on the N and Al atoms, respectively, indicating that the Al atoms could act as electron deficient centers towards the electron donor molecules [9].\nIn this study, HNO molecule was chosen as target adsorbate. We carried out full structural optimization on the Al12N12 nanocage with and without HNO molecule to examine the energetic, equilibrium geometries and electronic properties. We probed a number of orientations as well as different adsorption sites on the nanocage surface, for\ninstance, the top (above the Al or N atom) and bridge (above the Al–N bond) site in order to find the lowest-energy configuration for the adsorbate/adsorbent system.\nAfter optimization of pristine nanocage, to find the minimum energy structure, HNO is placed in different positions of this cage and six possible adsorption structures (i.e., A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6) are obtained.\nThe constant structures following full structural optimization and their DOS plot are shown in Figs. 2–4. Also, the electronic properties of the pristine cage and their complexes with the HNO molecule are shown in Table 1. According to these findings, for the molecular adsorption, the molecule of HNO prefers to attach to the Al site of the Al12N12 surface. The connection of the oxygen of HNO on the Al of Al12N12 HNO/Al12N12 is desirable compared to other atoms in an energetic manner (Fig. 3).\nConfiguration A1 in Fig. 2 shows a feeble interaction between the HNO molecule and the Al12N12 nanocage via its O atom above hexagonal ring and the computed interaction spacing is almost 2.84 Å. In Configuration A3 and A6 (Fig. 4), the HNO molecule close to the Al12N12 nanocage via its N atom and the computed interaction spacing is almost 2.02 Å. as shown in Fig. 2, Configuration A4 shows a interaction between the HNO molecule and the Al12N12 nanocage via its O atom\nabove tetragonal ring with the equilibrium distance of about 2.04 Å. In these Configurations (A2, A3, A5, and A6), a HNO molecule, was initially placed above aluminum and nitrogen atoms, with the HNO molecule oriented perpendicular and parallel (with the N or O atom pointing towards the nanocage surface) to the nanocage. After full relaxation, four configurations with the adsorbed HNO axis aligned diagonal to the nanocage surface was found to be stable: (i) the nitrogen head (configuration A3 and A6) and (ii) the oxygen head (configuration A2 and A5) of HNO adsorbed on the top of an Al atom of the nanocage (Figs. 3 and 4). The calculations show that the adsorption of HNO molecule from its O head on the top of an Al atom (A2) is an exothermic process with negative Eads of −0.73 eV and interaction distance of 2.01 Å (Fig. 3). The interaction leads to charge transfer of 0.05 |e| from the HNO to the nanocage (Table 1), indicating that the HNO acts as an electron donor and the nanocage as an electron acceptor. The all above mentioned suggest that in the configuration A2, the interaction between the molecule and the nanocage is much stronger in comparison to that of other.\nSo, the favorable adsorption structures are complexes A2 and A5 (Fig. 3) while, the equilibrium distance between the oxygen atom and the aluminum atom in these complexes are about 2.01 and 2.02 Å, respectively. The above results show that configuration A1 should be\nconsidered as physisorption. State of chemisorption is the other type of the interaction between HNO and Al12N12 so that the O or N atoms of HNO molecule are near the Al atom of the nanocage (i.e., A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6) with the adsorption energies (Ead) of −0.73, −1.03, −1.01, −0.73 and −1.05 , respectively.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, the adsorption of HNO induces a local structural deformation on the HNO and the Al12N12 nanocage. The bond length of N = O of HNO is enhanced from 1.20 Å in isolated HNO to 1.23 Å in A2 and A5 complexes, respectively. Also, the length of the N–H bond of HNO is reduced from 1.07 Å in free HNO to 1.05 Å in the complexes (A2 and A5). The Al–N bonds of the Al12N12 are enhanced from 1.79 and 1.85 Å in the pristine nanocage to 1.81 and 1.88 Å in the HNO-absorbed form. The appreciable adsorption energy and deformation of the system structure propose that the interaction in the A2 and A5 complexes depend on chemisorption. The above findings show that the HNO molecules were chemisorbed on the Al12N12, and the nanocage can be a promising absorbent for the adsorption of HNO. B3LYP, a popular functional, has been used in several theoretical studies on nanostructures [35–37]. Here, this functional was used with two popular basis sets (6-31G*, 6-31G**) to find an optimal basis set from the standpoints of calculation time and accuracy. A negligible deviation (0.2 eV) was observed for Ead, when the 6-31G* basis set augmented\nwith polarization function (6-31G**). We found that 6-31G* is the most optimal basis set among the two investigated basis sets from the standpoints of calculation time and accuracy. Using polarization functions in the basis set, result in small (< 10%) changes in the binding energies and do not alter the revealed trends in complex geometries and binding energies. These corrections are likely to be unnecessary for accurate geometry calculations.Also, Ahmadi et al have shown that the 6-31G* is the most optimal basis set from the standpoints of calculation time and accuracy [38].\nThe whole density of states (DOSs) in each system was applied to examine the electronic structure of pristine Al12N12 and Al12N12-HNO complexes. The energy gap (Eg) between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the pristine Al12N12 and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) was computed to be 3.91 eV. The DOSs of the Al12N12 indicate an important variation due to HNO adsorption, representing that the electronic attributes of the nanocage are susceptible to the HNO adsorption. Particularly, both valence and conduction levels slightly shift toward higher energies, so that Eg of the nanocage is much reduced for the all HNO/Al12N12 complexes. Particularly, Eg reduces from 3.91 eV in the pristine cage to 1.41 eV (63.5% change) and 1.42 eV (63.8% change) in complexes A2 and A5, enhancing their electrical conductance. Eg was found relevant to the population of\nconduction electron (N) according to Eq. (3) and it is possible to use its variation as an appropriate indicator for the sensibility of an absorbent to a chemical [39].\n=N AT exp3/2 ( Eg 2kT ) (3)\nwhere A is a constant (electrons/m3 K3/2) and k shows the Boltzmann’s constant. According to the numerous articles a good consent exits between the results of this technique and those of the investigations [39–41]. Eq. (3) expresses the increased conduction electrons population as a result of a reduction in the Eg exponentially, hence, the\nelectrical conductivity able to transform to an electrical signal is improved. The signal is linked to the existence of HNO in the ambient. It should be stated that it is possible to identify the existence of HNO by Al12N12 cage through generating an electrical noise. Moreover, we evaluated the impact of the investigated gases adsorption on the level of Fermi and work function (Ф) of the Al12N12 cage as a basic factor in the Ф-type sensors. the decrease in EF with HNO adsorption leads to an escalation in the work function (Φ) about 21.53%.The work function (Φ) is the energy content required to delete an electron from the Fermi level.\n= +V EFel ( ) (2)\nwhere V el (+∞) is the electrostatic potential energy of an electron away from a structured surface. If V el (+∞) = 0, we can write Φ = -EF. The energy of the Fermi level is also calculated as follows:\n= +E E (E E )/2F HOMO LUMO HOMO (4)\nSo, in these complexs (i.e., A2 and A5), the electrical conductivity and work function of Al12N12 nanocage are enhanced. So, the attendance of the HNO can be discovered by the conductivity variation of the nano-cage after and before the adsorption process. This phenomenon can be described according to the below equation:\nwhere k is constant of Boltzmann and σ is the electric conductivity of the complexs. According to Eq. (4), a smaller Eg at a certain temperature leads to a larger electric conductivity. So, the significant variation in Eg of the Al12N12 nano-cage indicates that the nano-cage can be a promising candidate for detecting the HNO molecule."

The density of electronic energy is obtained from the equation H = G + V, where V and G are the potential energy and local kinetic densities at a BCP, respectively. The density of energy time G is computed according to the Virial theorem 1/4∇2ρ = 2G + V [42]. A BCP with (H > 0 and ∇2ρ > 0), (H < 0 and ∇2ρ < 0), and (H < 0 and ∇2ρ > 0) shows various types of interactions such as noncovalent, covalent, and highly polar covalent, respectively.

      "text" : "nanocage. The results show that in the presence of HNO molecule, O atom of HNO interacts with Al12N12 nano-cage. The geometries and topological parameters of this HNO- cage, which interacted in H and O sites, are presented in Table 2. As can be seen, the Laplacian sign for NAl and O-Al in all structures was positive, indicating the bonds were closed-shell interaction like van der Waals and ionic interaction. Also, for the analyzed bonds, H > 0 and ∇2ρ > 0 represent a noncovalent nature. In comparison, H < 0 and ∇2ρ > 0 indicate the nature of highly polar covalent. A more negative value of density of electronic energy at the BCP of the O26-N7 compared to that of the H25-N17 indicates more covalent properties of the O26-N7 bond. The obtained critical points and bond paths of A2 and A5 configurations are shown in the topological graphs (Fig. 5)."

The results of UV-Visible adsorption data for Al12N12 nanocage and the most stable complex (A2) are shown in Table 3. It is clear from the obtained results that the maximum electronic transmission for the pristine cage happens at the 390.29 nm wavelength corresponding to the highest oscillator stability 0.0007 with the 3.176 eV transmission energy. According to UV-Vis spectrum analysis, after adsorption of HNO on the nanocage, the transmission wavelength shifts toward the longer wavelength side of the spectra and occurs at 702.15 nm wavelength corresponding to the highest oscillator stability 0.0151 for A2 configuration. So, the red shift\nhappens when the HNO molecule is close to the Al12N12 nano-cage. The UV-Visible spectra for Al12N12 nanocage and A2 complex are presented in (see Table 4)."

It was observed that the HNO molecule chemisorbed through its oxygen to an Al of the surface of nanocage with adsorption energy of −0.7 eV with a 6-31G* basis set. The computation results also indicated that the adsorption of the HNO molecule on the surface of Al12N12 induces some shifts in the electronic attributes of the nanocage. Significant changes in electronic attributes of the Al12N12 nanocage on HNO adsorption lead to the conclusion that Al12N12 is a new potential sensor for measuring the HNO molecule. According to UV-Vis spectrum analysis, after adsorption of HNO on the nanocage, the transmission wavelength shifts toward the longer wavelength side of the spectra and occurs at 506.98 nm for A2 configuration. So, the red shift happens when the HNO molecule is close to the Al12N12 nano-cage. The present results show that Al12N12 nanocage can be a potential effective absorbent for the adsorption of HNO. Additionally, we showed that 6-31G* is an optimal basis set from the standpoints of calculation time and accuracy for B3LYP functional among two considered basis sets.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nBai Yuqi: Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization.
