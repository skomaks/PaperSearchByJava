Huge interest has been paid recently in the\ndevelopment of carbon allotropes with high degrees of sp hybridization as the\npresence of ethynyl units can considerably affect their properties.

Graphene quantum dots, graphdiyne, supercapacitors, solar cells, ion\nbatteries, carbyne\n2\n1. Introduction.\nCarbon is one of the most important elements in nature and is closely related to\nthe development of human history. Carbon nanomaterials demonstrate a variety of\nproperties such as the hardness—softness, insulator—semiconductor—conductor,\nthermal insulation—thermal conductivity, full light absorption—full light\ntransmission, heat resistance, radiation resistance, chemical resistance, surface and\ninterface properties [1-7], etc, and they are extensively applied in a wide range of\nfields including catalysis, electronics, energy storage, biomedicine and therapy [2, 8-17]. Thanks to the various combinations of carbon atom hybridization, such as sp3, sp2, sp, carbon allotropes with different structures and properties are obtained. Apart from two naturally existing carbon allotropes: diamond (sp3) and graphite (sp2), the discovery of fullerenes (sp2) [1], carbon nanotubes (sp2) [18, 19] and graphene (sp2)[20] expanded the categories of available versatile dimensionality of sp2-hybridized carbon materials (zero-, one-, and two-dimensional (0D, 1D, 2D),\nrespectively). Theoretically, carbon allotropes can be constructed by changing the periodic motifs within networks of sp3-, sp2-, and sp-hybridized carbon atoms due to\nthe versatile flexibility of carbon atoms [21-23]. Huge interest has been paid\nnowadays in the development of carbon allotropes with high degrees of sp\nhybridization because the presence of ethynyl units plays a significant role in the properties. In this regard, we aim at three allotropes with sp2 or/and sp hybridized\ncarbon atoms: graphene quantum dots (GQDs), graphdiyne (GDY) and carbyne. 0D GQDs material is taken as the representative for carbon allotropes with sp2\nhybridization owing to a large surface area, low cytotoxicity, excellent solubility and\ntunable bandgap, as well as quantum confinement effects and edge effects. The extended existence of sp2- and sp-carbon atoms endows 2D GDY material with high\nπ-conjunction, tunable electronic properties, and uniformly distributed pores, which\nmakes it a developing material star. The advent of so-called “carbyne” is an infinite\ncarbon chain with sp hybridization, and is regarded as the only true 1D carbon\nallotrope. Special focus has been given to the fabrication strategies and recent energy\n3\nstorage and conversion applications based on GQDs and GDYs including\nsupercapacitors, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and solar cells.\nAs is well known that it has sensationalized the world and greatly promoted the\nstudy of graphene-based materials when the research on graphene won the Nobel\nPrize in Physics in 2010 [20]. Standing for a new type of quantum dots (QDs) with\nunique properties associated with both graphene and QDs, GQDs are single or\nfew-layer graphene with a tiny size of only several nanometers. In contrast to the\nother 0D carbon nanomaterials known as carbon dots that lack explicit structural\ninformation, GQDs obviously possess graphene lattices inside the dots despite of the\ndot size [24-26]. Comparing to its 2D native form, GQDs offer some unique merits\nsuch as bandgap opening due to quantum confinement, excellent dispersibility, more\nabundant active sites (edges, functional groups, dopants, etc.), better tunability in\nchemicophysical properties, and comparable size to biomolecules [1, 27, 28]. Several\nexcellent reviews on GQDs have been published recently focusing on sensing [6, 25]\nand bioimaging [29]. Regarding the energy-oriented applications, Wang et al. [27]\nproposed a review on QDs derived from 2D materials including graphene, transition\nmetal dichalcogenide, graphitic carbon nitride, hexagonal boron nitride, and\nphosphorene with an emphasis on catalysis and energy applications in 2016. Since\nthen, the energy field is rapidly evolving and many new exciting progresses have been\nmade. Therefore, latest significant developments on GQDs as the representative carbon allotrope with sp2 hybridization for energy storage and conversion applications\nare needed.\nAs a new member of carbon nanomaterial family, graphyne (GY), which features\nassembled layers of sp- and sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, has attracted tremendous\nattention since the first serendipitous discovery in 1987 [30]. This planar, layered\nmaterial containing both acetylenic linkages and hexagonal rings was named for its\nsimilar structure to graphite and ethyne (Figure 1a, b). It was not until 2010 that Li’s\ngroup proposed a methodology to prepare large area graphdiyne (GDY) films on the\nsurface of copper via a cross-coupling reaction using hexaethynylbenzene (HEB) as precursor [31]. The excellent semiconductor feature (conductivity of 2.516 × 10−4 S\n4\nm−1) was similar to that of silicon, making GDY promising in electronics and semiconductors. This work verified the successful preparation of GDY with sp-sp2\ncarbon hybridization in the laboratory and promoted the rapid development of GDYs\nin practical applications. Many efforts including theoretical calculations and\nexperimental results have been made during the last decade, exploring the potential\nmechanical, optical and electronic properties of GDY based materials [15, 32-34].\nIn the 1960s, a suspected new carbon allotrope, called carbyne, was discovered\nin a German crater called Chaoite, and triggered intensive interest all over the world.\nThe carbyne is an infinite carbon chain with sp hybridization, and the carbon–carbon\ntriple bond (sp) is a quite useful connecting unit owing to the structural linearity that\ndoes not suffer from fluctuation originating from cis–trans isomerization. Theoretical\npredictions reveal that carbyne is a very promising material with plenty of outstanding\n5\nproperties. Unfortunately, it is difficult to synthesize and characterize carbyne, and\nonly linear carbon chains with dozens of carbon atoms in the laboratory were\nsuccessfully obtained at present. In this regard, only a brief overview of extraordinary\nproperties of carbyne is predicted regrading two possible geometric arrangements of\ncarbyne: cumulene with double bonds throughout the chain (=C=C=C=C=) and\npolyyne with alternating single and triple bonds (-C≡C-C≡C-).\nHerein, the general properties and fabrication methodologies of three carbon\nallotropes (GQDs, GDYs and carbyne) are summarized. Special focus has been given\nto the recent energy storage and conversion applications based on GQDs and GDYs\nincluding supercapacitors, LIBs and solar cells (Figure 1c). The challenges and\nperspectives are also discussed."

      "text" : "As a 2D crystal with mono-atomic layer, graphene is composed entirely of\ncarbon atoms and has a perfect hexagonal crystal structure. The arrangement of carbon atoms is bonded by sp2 hybrid orbitals in the same way as that of graphite\nmonoatomic layer. The unique 2D crystal structure of graphene offers many excellent properties [35], such as great specific surface area (2 630 m2 g-1), high electron mobility (200 000 cm2 (V·s)-1), high Young's modulus (≈ 1.0 TPa), high thermal conductivity (≈ 5 000 W (m·K)-1), high optical transmittance (≈ 97.7%) and excellent\nconductivity [36-40]. One of the most important properties is its unique carrier\nproperties and mass-free Dirac Fermion properties [41]. The carriers in graphene\nfollow a special quantum tunneling effect and do not generate backscatter when they\nencounter impurities, which is why graphene has superior conductivity and high\ncarrier mobility.\nInterestingly, when the 2D graphene transforms to 0D (GQDs, i.e., lateral sizes\nbeing reduced to typically <20 nm), superior or new properties emerge due to\nprominent edge and quantum confinement effects, and meanwhile, some inherent\nmerits of the 2D parents are still preserved. GQDs are small graphene flakes usually\n6\nsmaller than 100 nm in size and less than 10 layers in thickness, which bears defects\nin graphitic lattice, chemical moieties and heteroatom dopants."

      "heading" : "2.1.1 Photoluminescence properties",
      "text" : "The photoluminescence (PL) properties of GQDs are intriguingly governed by\nthe combination or competition between intrinsic state and defect state emission [28].\nThe former derives from quantum confinement, edge effects (zigzag or armchair\nedge), and radiative recombination of localized electron–hole pairs, while the latter is\ninduced by energy trap states because of chemical groups, dopants or vacancy defects\n[27]. The high tunability makes it challenging to synthesize GQDs with homogeneous\nproperties, thus sometimes leading to contradictory hypotheses due to inconsistent\nexperimental observations. The fact that the PL properties of GQDs are determined by\nnumerous parameters results in unsettled PL mechanism for GQDs.\nCompared to zero-bandgap semi-metallic 2D pristine graphene sheets, GQDs are\nfluorescent and semi-conductive with size-dependent bandgaps due to quantum\nconfinement effect. Chen’s group systematically calculated the emission wavelength\nof pristine zigzag-edged GQDs with different diameters ranging from 0.46 to 2.31 nm\n(Figure 2a), and found that these GQDs (G1-G6) fluoresced from deep UV (bandgap\nof 6.81 eV) to near infrared (bandgap of 1.64 eV) indicating the size dependent PL of\nGQDs [42]. In addition to the prominent size-dependence, the excitation wavelength\ndependence of the emission wavelength and intensity is another common\nphenomenon observed in carbon-based fluorescent materials [28]. On the other hand,\nheteroatom doping is another route to enhance fluorescence quantum yield [43] and\nconfer interesting up-conversion properties on GQDs originating from an anti-Stokes\ntransition or a multiphoton active process [44-46]. Li et al. [47] demonstrated that\nnitrogen-doping (with pyridinic and pyrrolic N atoms; N/C atomic ratio of ca. 4.3%)\ncould cause the blueshift of GQD emission, to be specific, pyrrolic N-doping [42].\nIt was reported that small sp2 clusters isolated within the sp3 carbon network\nwere responsible for the PL emission of graphene oxide sheets [48-50]. Similarly, most synthesized GQDs were composed of isolated sp2 clusters, which dominated the\n7\nPL emission [42]. In general, GQDs mostly have some oxygen-containing functional\ngroups, such as hydroxyl, epoxy/ether, and carbonyl/carboxylic acid groups, leading\nto the formation of “surface states”, which are the energy levels between π and π*\nstates of C=C. The resultant various energy levels may result in a series of emissive\ntraps. When a certain excitation wavelength illuminates the GQDs, a surface state\nemissive trap will dominate the emission [51].\nFigure 2.

      "text" : "GQDs usually possess wide rang absorption with a tail extending to visible\nregion. Two characteristic peaks are often observed in the UV-vis absorption spectrum:\none between 200–270 nm due to π–π* transition and the other between 270–390 nm\n8\ndue to n–π* transition from C=O functional groups [26, 28]. The size dependent\noptical absorption characteristics are attributed to the quantum confinement effect.\nThe absorption peak red-shifted from 270 nm to 330 nm when increasing the size\nfrom 1–4 nm to 7–11 nm for GQDs synthesized by chemical oxidation and cutting of\ncarbon fibers at different temperatures [53]. While the hydrothermally prepared GQDs\nalso showed the same size dependence: with varying the average size of GQDs from 5\nto 35 nm, the peak energy of the absorption spectra monotonously decreased (Figure\n2b,c) [52]. However, for the GQDs prepared via glucose carbonization, the two\nabsorption peaks were independent of the size even though the size increased from\n1.65 to 21 nm (Figure 2d,e) [51]. Besides, the variation of oxygen content was\nreported to play important role in deciding the absorption peak position of GQDs [54]."

      "text" : "The preparation of GQDs is mainly divided into two categories: top-down and\nbottom-up methods. The former usually employs various carbon materials (e.g.,\ngraphene sheets, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers) as precursors to be separated,\ncut or peeled into small-sized GQDs by solvothermal, hydrothermal, mechanical,\nchemical and electrochemical means, including acid oxidation, electron beam\nirradiation, arc discharge, oxygen plasma treatment, microwave assisted irradiation,\netc. These methods are of low throughput, and produce GQDs with undesired lateral\nsize and thickness (layer number). The harsh conditions inevitably damage the\ngraphene lattice structure. While the bottom-up methods involve small organic\nmolecules as carbon precursors (e.g., glucose, hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene, citric\nacid) through dehydration, polymerization, and carbonization, such as fullerenes cage\nopening methods, solution chemistry methods, pyrolysis of polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons, and unfocused laser irradiation, etc. The produced GQDs are always in\nwell-distributed sizes with controllable morphologies.

Moreover, the prepared GQDs exhibit good\nstability without accumulation or color change when being stored in ambient\ncondition for a long period, such as 3 months [60]. While the disadvantage lies in the\nlong-time pretreatment of graphite raw materials, and the subsequently cumbersome\nseparation process. Generally, the mechanism of electrochemical reactions can be\nexplained by three main steps: i) Firstly, the electrolyte produces oxygen radicals (O·)\nand hydroxyl radicals (HO·) which act on the anode, to oxidize and shear the crystal\nlattice of graphite accompanying by the carboxyl plasma into the graphite layer. ii)\nThen graphite anode expands significantly. Meanwhile, the outer edge region of\ngraphene undergoes oxidative decomposition reaction, and precipitation gradually\n10\noccurs in the solution. iii) At last, the graphite sheet is obviously peeled off from the\nanode with most of the graphite fragmented into nanoscale GQDs [61-63].\nDifferent electrode materials can be used in the electrochemical generation of\nGQDs, such as graphite rod, carbon nanotube, carbon paste, carbon fiber and Pt sheets\nwith the carbon source in electrolyte solution [63-66]. Common electrolytes include\nionic liquid, acetonitrile containing tetrabutylammonium perchlorate and NaH2PO4 [67]. The electrode materials and electrolytes are important as they can render the\nGQDs with different properties relating to surface states, cytotoxicity and PL\nperformance. For instance, Ananthanarayanan et al. [60] used an ionic liquid in\nacetonitrile (10%, v/v)) as the electrolyte to offer high ionic conductivity and wide\nelectrochemical potential window, and produced high quality GQDs from monolithic\n3D graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with good crystallinity,\nuniform distribution of lateral diameter (~ 3 nm) and thickness (mostly single layer) at\na constant voltage of 5 V for 100 s (Figure 4a). Huang et al. [18] developed a weak\nelectrolyte-based (typically an ammonia solution) electrochemical method to enhance\nthe oxidation and cutting process (Figure 4b), and confirmed the significant\nadvantages of weak electrolyte for preparation GQDs. Compared with strong\nelectrolytes, the yield of GQDs (3~8 nm) obtained by this method was increased by\n28 times.\n11\nFigure 4. (a) Schematic illustration of GQDs synthesis from 3D graphene.

However, it usually\nrequires a lot of reagents and time to obtain the raw materials first through a series of\nchemical reactions. The mechanism was first proposed by Pan et al. [68] and is\nschemed in Figure 4c: The graphene sheet is first treated with concentrated acid to\nproduce graphene oxide (GO), making the oxygen-containing functional group\nattached to the edge and cavity of the graphene sheet forms linearly arranged epoxy chains. These epoxy chains surround the surrounding sp2 clusters, leading to the\n12\nbreakage of C-C bonds in the region. Under hydrothermal conditions, the chemical\nchains are easily open, and the oxygen atoms are detached, while the relatively stable\ncarboxyl groups are retained, resulting in excellent water-soluble GQDs.\nZhao et al. [55] used the commonly hydrothermal process to cut GO with\nassistance of potassium superoxide (KO2) as proper “scissors”. The produced GQDs with yellow fluorescence in aqueous solution were obtained, and the yield was as high\nas 35%. Qin et al.[69] developed a facile and ‘‘slow-release’’ method to prepare\nGQDs by immersing graphene hydrogels in low-polarity organic solvents (Figure\n4d,e). The obtained GQDs showed a strong fluorescence effect in the near ultraviolet\nregion with sizes of 2.3 nm to 3.8 nm.

Typically, in a closed reaction\nenvironment, the substance is allowed to react in a liquid phase solvent under\nconditions of high temperature and high pressure. Shin et al. [70] developed a novel\nacid-free and solvothermal synthesis of GQDs using various natural carbon resources\nincluding graphite, multiwall carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers, and charcoal. They\nused oxone as a neutral oxidant to directly synthesize GQDs through one-pot\nsolvothermal method and followed by a simple purification step. The obtained GQDs\nwere fairly uniform with size distribution of 2-8 nm and exhibited a strong blue PL\nunder 365 nm UV light illumination. Note that it was the first time that GQDs had\nbeen mass produced directly from natural carbon resources by solvothermal method.\nTian et al.

The size of GQDs prepared by this method can be precisely adjusted, and\nusually has good water solubility. Generally, the water solubility and large size of\nGQDs are not compatible by solution chemistry method. As the size of graphene\nincreases, the interaction between layers becomes stronger and the water solubility\ndrops greatly.\nYan et al.[57] obtained tunable and uniform GQDs by multiple 2′,4′,6′-triakyl\nphenyl groups covalently attached to the edges of graphene moieties, which resulted\nin reduced face-to-face interaction between the graphene sheets, thus effectively\nincreasing their solubility and producing stable GQDs larger than previously achieved.\nThe prepared GQDs contained 168, 132 and 170 carbon atoms, respectively, which\nwas the largest stable colloidal GQDs material reported at that time. The flexible side\nchain was adsorbed onto the graphene, making the attraction between the solvent and\nthe side chain greater than that between graphene layers [80]. Subsequently, driven by\nentropy, the spacing of the graphene layers become large, and then increasing water\nsolubility. However, for large-size GQDs, the interlayer force was greater than the\nsolubilizing power, which failed to achieve the above effect. Here, 2', 4', 6'-triakyl\n14\nphenyl was encapsulated on the outside of GQDs to form a 3D cage structure, so that\nGQDs could no longer be stacked, which not only enhanced its water solubility but\nalso improved the stability.\nXu et al.

Subsequently, triethylamine, boron trifluoride and diethyl ether were separately\nadded and stirred, and the aqueous solution was extracted with dichloromethane after\nwashing with water.

      "text" : "Supercapacitors, also named electrochemical capacitors, store energy based on\neither electrochemical double layer effect or fast surface redox reactions\n16\n(pseudo-capacitance). The advantages lay on the fast charge/discharge rates\n(compared with rechargeable batteries) and long cycle life (millions of cycles), as well\nas a reasonable energy density (sometimes even close to batteries) [86, 87]. Presently,\ncommercial supercapacitors are mostly electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC),\nbecause of their low cost and technical maturity. But the low energy density limits the practical application. In general, the energy density of EDLCs is less than 10 Wh kg-1, and this value is less than 50 Wh kg-1 for pseudocapacitors. Lots of work has been\ndone to effectively improve the energy density.\nCompared with graphene sheets, GQDs have larger specific surface area, more\nsurface-active sites, and more accessible edges, which can conveniently afford full\naccessibility of ion adsorption/desorption. Besides, the excellent electron mobility of\nGQDs is favorable to increase the conductivity of the active layer and greatly\nfacilitates the charge transport through the active layer. By electrophoretic deposition\nof GQDs on the interdigital Au finger microelectrodes, Liu et al. [88] constructed a\nGQD-based symmetric micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) with high rate capability, high\nfrequency response, and outstanding cycle stability (97.8% retention after 5000\ncycles). In addition, another kind of GQD-based asymmetric MSC involving\nelectrodeposited MnO2 nanoneedles was also assembled and two times higher specific capacitance (1107.4 µF·cm-2 at) and energy density (0.154 µWh·cm-2) were obtained\ncomparing to the symmetric MSC in the same aqueous solution. Huang et al. [89]\nused GQDs to induce the morphological change of CuCo2S4 nanosheets from smooth surface to rough with particles accumulative features. Electrochemical performance\ntests revealed that the GQD/CuCo2S4 electrode possessed a specific capacitance of 1725 F·g-1 at 0.5 A·g-1 and good cycling life (90% retention after 10000 cycles),\nwhich was possibly due to the rich electroactive sites and short diffusion paths for\ncharge transport originated from the unique particles-accumulative morphology.\nHowever, more work needs to be done to get insight into the formation mechanism of\nthe morphological evolution as no significant morphology change could be observed\nwhen replacing CuCo2S4 by another bimetal oxide NiMoO4.\n17\nBesides, heteroatom doping (such as N [68, 90, 91], S [92-94], and B [95-97]) of\nGQDs can effectively regulate their intrinsic properties including surface and local\nchemical properties, optical and electrical properties. For instance, with close atomic\nradius to carbon atoms, N atoms can change the electron donor/acceptor properties of\nthe graphene layer [90, 91], which affected the charge and discharge of the electric\ndouble layer and the Faraday reaction of the tantalum capacitor, thereby effectively\nimproving the capacitance performance of GQDs-based electrodes. Li et al. [98]\nsynthesized N-doped GQDs (N-GQDs) by the alkali-catalyzed molecular fusion\nmethod and assembled them onto the carbonized metal–organic framework (cMOF-5)\nto produce hierarchical N-doped porous carbon electrode (Figure 5a-c). The obtained\nN-GQDs offered a high concentration of active N and O sites owing to the most\nmarked edge effect and doping effect, which played an important role in enhancing\nthe pseudocapacitive activity and improving the surface wettability of the electrode,\nwhile cMOF-5 provided an effective cubic porous framework with a large specific\nsurface area and good electrical conductivity. Therefore, the capacitance was boosted from 188 F·g-1 (cMOF-5) to 780 F·g-1 (N-GQD/cMOF-5) at a scan rate of 10 mV·s-1.\nThe N-GQD/cMOF-5 symmetric supercapacitor exhibited cyclic stability with 94.1%\nretention after 5000 cycles and 84.6% retention after 12 000 cycle with coulombic\nefficiency of 92.2%, confirming the good cycling life and excellent stability.\nMoreover, when used as the positive electrode, the N-GQD/cMOF-5//AC (activated carbon) asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited an energy density of 14.4 Wh·kg-1 at a power density of 400.6 W·kg-1 (under a wide potential window of 0~1.6 V). The\nlightening behavior also indicated the high energy density (inset of Figure 5c).\nZheng et al. [99] used an electrochemical method to synthesize\namino-functionalized GQDs (af-GQDs) and designed Ni(OH)2/af-GQDs composites (Figure 5d-f). The layered Ni(OH)2 nanosheets were spaced by -NH2 groups from af-GQDs in a self-assembled manner, forming a sandwiched structure with a large\npore size of 1.8 nm, which reduced the accumulation of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets and increased electrode surface area. The introduction of af-GQDs led to enhanced\nelectrical conductivity, the accessibility of the charged ions and better cycling stability\n18\nas well as contributing additional EDLC. So the specific capacitance reached 2653 F·g-1 at 1 A g-1 in 1 M KOH solution with good rate capability. As for the asymmetric\nsupercapacitor based on Ni(OH)2/af-GQDs and electrochemical-exfoliated graphene , it exhibited a wide potential window range (~1.8 V), a high energy density, and an\nexcellent cycling stability with 90.15% capacitance retention.\n2.3.2 Lithium ion batteries\n19\nWith the continuous development of high-tech products such as portable devices\nand electric vehicles, people's requirements for the performance of LIBs batteries\nkeep rising [17, 19, 100-102]. As a traditional electrode material, graphite has the\nadvantages of low cost and high chemical stability. Moreover, graphite is one of the\nearliest commercial anode materials for LIBs [103]. But it has low lithium ion\ndiffusion coefficient, and the low theoretical maximum capacity of graphite (372 mAh g-1, LiC6) hardly meets our demand for high-capacity batteries [104, 105]. In this regard, GQDs are expected to show great potential due to the tunable size and surface\nchemistry. The introduction of GQDs not only affects the electrolyte transport, but\nalso greatly improves the electron transfer and the lithium storage capacity [106].\nChao et al. [107] designed a novel type of binder-free cathode by bottom-up\ngrowth of biface VO2 arrays directly on graphene foam and then coating uniformly with GQDs by electrophoresis deposition (GVG electrode) (Figure 6a,b). Here, the\nGQDs acted as sensitizer to improve ion diffusion and charge transport kinetics;\nmeanwhile, the homogeneous GQDs coverage can suppress the dissolution of VO2 and agglomeration of the arrays. Thus, the GVG electrode delivered a capacity more than 420 mAh·g-1 and capacity retention of 94% after 1500 cycles at 18 A·g-1 in lithiation. During sodiation, it can also exhibit a high capacity of 306 mAh·g-1 and\nsuperior rate tolerance, as well as good capacity retention (88% after 1500 cycles at 18 A·g-1) with a power density of 42 kW·kg-1 at an energy density more than 100 Wh·kg-1. Guo et al. [108] synthesized GQDs doped MoS2 nanosheets via a facile solvothermal method with boosted electrochemical lithium storage properties. The\ndoped GQDs served as conducting components to enhance the electron transfer in the\npoorly conductive MoS2, and also as toughening additives to buffer the volume variation and thus improving the cyclic stability of the electrode. As expected,\ncompared with the pristine MoS2, the obtained GQDs/MoS2 electrode exhibited high reversible capacity (1099 mA h·g-1 at 100 mA·g-1), good cyclic stability and excellent rate performance (660 mAh·g-1 at 5000 mA·g-1).\n20\nFigure 6.

[109] selected carboxyl-functionalized GQDs and af-GQDs\nto modify yolk–shell NiO microspheres to give NiO/GQDs electrodes (Figure 6c,d).\nThe modification of GQDs on the surface also served both as a conductive media for\nbetter electron transfer and as an addictive buffer to alleviate the volume change\nduring cycling. Compared with the capacitance of bald NiO without GQDs modification (396 mAh·g-1), the obtained NiO/GQDs-COOH and NiO/GQDs-NH2 electrodes displayed remarkably improved lithium storage performance with a specific capacity of 1081 and 834 mAh·g-1 after 250 cycles at 0.1 A·g-1, respectively.\nThe slightly better behavior of NiO/GQDs-COOH that that of NiO/GQDs-NH2 was\n21\npossibly due to a higher content of functionalized GQDs with more uniformly\ndistribution on surfaces of NiO microspheres and stronger electronegativity of oxygen\natoms in carboxyl groups than that of nitrogen atoms in amino groups in the GQDs."

The possible wide-range absorption of GQDs makes them attractive for\ndesigning efficient solar cells. Besides, the two orders of magnitude slower hot carrier\ncooling rate (100–300 ps) of GQDs (compared with bulk graphene) also enables more\nefficient hot charge carrier harvesting in solar energy conversion [110]. Travis G.\nNovak et al. [111] proposed that the functionalization of GQDs with low molecular\nweights of polyethylene glycol (PEG) significantly improved the GQD interaction\nwith the P3HT:PCBM (poly 3-hexylthiophene: 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl\nester) active layer, resulting in improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of\norganic solar cells. The reason was possibly because that faster P3HT exciton\ndissociation in GQD containing cells led to an absorption improvement in the visible\nrange due to fewer bound charges remaining in P3HT (Figure 7a,b). Jaehoon Ryu et\nal. [112] found that the introduction of the GQDs into planar-type perovskite solar\ncells boosted the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) by the ultrafast electron extraction to the blocking TiO2 layer (Figure 7c,d). Size effect of GQDs on cell performance was studied and the results revealed\nthat the devices with appropriately sized-GQDs showed an average PCE of 10%\nenhancement compared with those cells without GQDs (19.11% as the best PCE).\n22\nFigure 7.

By accounting for the number of acetylene bonds between two benzene rings,\nGYs can be distinguished as graphyne, graphdiyne, graphtriyne and so on (Figure 8a).\nBy varying the linkages of acetylene bonds, GYs can also be split into different planar\nstructures, such as 6,6,12-, α-, and β-GY, which have also been theoretically discussed\nand reviewed [95, 113, 114]. Four different types of C–C bonds can be found in GYs. (1) C(sp2)–C(sp2) bonds of the benzene rings with bond lengths of ~1.426 Å; (2) C(sp2)–C(sp) bonds between neighboring C═C double bonds and C≡C triple bonds,\n23\nbond lengths of 1.407Å; (3) C(sp)–C(sp) triple carbon bonds, bond lengths of 1.223 Å;\n(4) single C–C bonds linking two adjacent C≡C bonds [115]. The GY monolayer has\nthe same hexagonal symmetry (P6m) as graphene.\nFigure 8. (a) Structure of GYs. Reproduced with permission [95]. Copyright 2012 American Physical Society.

Copyright 2011 American Physical Society.\nNote that only graphdiynes (GDYs) can be prepared in the laboratory, and most\nreported studies focus on GDYs. Thus, we will mainly discuss GDYs in this review.\nGDY is a large triangular ring of 18-carbon atoms with the introduction of butadiyne\nlinkages (−C≡C−C≡C−) [117, 118], demonstrating a 2D flat porous network, making\nit the most stable non-natural carbon allotrope containing diacetylene bonds [119]. In\nGDY, the bond lengths are1.33 Å for the single C–C bonds linking two adjacent C≡C\nbonds, which has some character of double bonds for the effect of multiple conjugation [120]. Due to the sp and sp2 carbon atoms and their related bonds, GDYs\ndisplay greater structural flexibility than graphene, which offer the opportunity to\nform curved structures. In an infinite plane, GDY has a 2D planar structure similar to\ngraphene, which can be simply regarded as about one-third of the C-C bonds in\ngraphene inserted into two C≡C bonds [121]. The 2D planar structure is formed via\nvan der Waals force and π-π interaction, which endows a high degree of π-conjugation\ncharacter, evenly dispersed pores, and tunable electronic structure [122]."

As shown in Figure 8b,\nthe band gap is 0.44 eV at the local density approximation (LDA) level and increases\nto 1.10 eV at the GW level [116]. The 1.5 times quasiparticle correction is due to the\nenhanced Coulomb interaction in reduced dimensionality. Interestingly, the energy\nband gap values of GDY can be widely tuned by hydrogenation or halogenation [125],\nmaking them promising candidates in optoelectronic devices. Due to the special role\nof C≡C bonds, GYs has versatile Dirac cones as suggested by the density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculation results [95]. The C≡C bonds modulate effective hopping\nmatrix elements and reverse their signs, resulting in Dirac cones of GYs having the\ncharacteristics of reversed chirality, momentum shift and switch of the energy gap\n[96]. GYs is a self-doped semiconductor that already has charge carriers, unlike\ngraphene that requires additional doping [126]. The intrinsic hole and electron mobility of 6,6,12-GYs can reach 4.29×105 and 5.41×105 cm2 (V s)-1, respectively [123, 127], larger than those of graphene.

The current synthetic methods of GDY include template coupling method\nin organic solvent [10, 130-132], chemical vapor deposition method [133, 134],\ntwo-phase coupling method [8, 135] and explosive coupling method [136, 137].\nAmong them, the template coupling method in organic solvent is the most common\nand mature strategy. Zhou et al. [138] synthesized the GDY nanowalls (GDY-NWs)\nby using the modified Glaser-Hay coupling reaction (Figure 9a). In this process, Cu\nions acted as catalysts, where the Glaser coupling reaction of HEB monomers\noccurred; pyridine acted as both ligand and solvent to dissolve Cu ions from the\nsurface of Cu foil.

The specific capacitance reached 71.4 F g-1 at 3.5 A g-1.

The oxidation form (graphdiyne\noxides, GDYO) was proved to be an even excellent substrate for MnO2 growth to enhance the capacitor performance. The MnO2@GDYO electrode had a high specific capacitance of 301 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and 98% initial capacitance retention was\nobserved after 3000 cycles.\nFigure 10.

Compared to graphite-based electrode\nmaterials, the specific capacities and lithiation potentials of GDY are greatly\nenhanced [148, 149]. By DFT calculations, it was found the theoretical capacity was twice the value of graphene (744 mAh g-1, LiC3) by adsorbing lithium on the surface because of the presence of acetylene bonds of GDY [150]. The lithiation potentials of\nGDY range from 2.7 to 2.1 V. Meanwhile, due to the large triangular pores of GDY,\nlithium ions can pass through the layers to form an out-of-plan diffusion with the\ndiffusion energy of only 0.18-0.48 eV [151]. Lou et al. [152] and Zhang et al. [153]\nstudied the energy and kinetics process of lithium in single-layer GDY by\nfirst-principle theory and found that the diffusion direction of lithium is not only\nparallel to the interlayer plane of the GDY layer, but also between the triangular pores,\nwhich makes graphite alkyne suitable for the anode material of LIBs [154].\nHuang et al. [155] prepared GDY-based electrode on the surface of Cu without\nbinder, which exhibited superior electrochemical performance including high specific\ncapacities, outstanding rate performance, and long cycle life (Figure 11a,b). The obtained reversible capacities were up to 520 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles at 500 mA g-1; and 420 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1. The authors elucidated the method\n28\nbehind the Li atom storage in multilayer GDY by using GDY with varying thickness.\nThe intercalation of Li atoms occurred primarily through both interlayer\ninsertion/extraction process and surface absorption/desorption process. However, the\nperformance is still far from the theoretical capacity value of GDY electrode.\nTherefore, more work needs to be done to further enhance the lithium storage\nperformance of GDY. For instance, it is necessary and effective to improve the graded\npores between the GDY monolayer film and sheet layer, as well as increasing the\nactive sites to promote the ion diffusion rate.

The GDY\nnanosheet was grown in situ by the mechanism of Glaser cross-coupling reaction.\nThey claimed that the reasonable voids with the flexible GDY walls were helpful for\nsolving the problems of interface contact and volume change of silicon anode during\nthe cycle process, leading to excellent cycle stability, high capacity and good rate performance.

As a well-established way, nitrogen (N) doping could generate heteroatomic\ndefects to increase electrochemical active binding sites, achieving enhanced\nelectrochemical performance [157-162]. Similar to the case in supercapacitors, the big\n30\nchallenge lies in how to control the content and type of N atoms. Yang et al.

The uniform distribution\nof F atoms in the 2D plane made the lithium ions being inserted into F-GDY more\nstable, resulting in more active sites. Meanwhile, the macroporous structure in the 2D\nmolecule improved the diffusion of lithium ions in the vertical direction. The flexible\nhalf-cell assembled with F-GDY as the cathode showed a reversible capacity of 1700 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, and remained a reversible capacity of approximately 350 mAh g-1 after 9000 cycles at 2 A g-1, therefore, it is predictable that F-GDY is a good option\nfor the next generation of flexible electrode materials in LIBs."

Li et al.[178] developed a simple method to use GDY as the host material\nfor the active layer of perovskite and found that the introduction of GDY can improve\nthe morphology of the active layer, and achieved a uniform MAPbI3 film with high crystallinity, large domain sizes, and few grain boundaries (Figure 13d-f). The XPS\nresults revealed the possible reasons for the crystallinity enhancement. The binding\nenergies of Pb 4f peak and I 3d peak in PbI2 (GDY) were both reduced by about 0.2 eV compared to those for PbI2, which may be induced by the Pb atom binding to the GDY coordinate bond to absorb more electrons, as well as inhibiting iodide ion\nvacancy formation, and thereby improving the crystal quality and the stability of the\nMAPbI3 film. The optimal PCE of the MAPbI3 (GDY)-based device reached 21.01% (PCE without GDY was 16.69%), and other parameters such as fill factor (FF) and\nshort-circuit current (Jsc) were also significantly improved. Another effective method to boost the electronic transmission property is adding dopants into the electron\ntransportation layer (ETL) of PSC (e.g., N-doping).[179]\n33\nand a relative humidity (RH) of 60%, the PCE of PVSK/GDY device was nearly\nunchanged and still maintained 95% after 140 days."

      "text" : "Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have the virtues of low production cost, high\nenergy conversion efficiency, and simple manufacturing, which have been regarded as\nan alternative to silicon-based solar cells [173, 181, 182]. Nevertheless, their\napplications have been limited by the reservation of precious metal Pt which has\ntraditionally been the material choice for the counter electrode on account of its\nresistance to electrolyte corrosion, high conductivity, and excellent catalytic\n34\nperformance for iodine reduction. A typical DSSC device usually contains a\ndye-sensitized anode, electrolyte, and a counter electrode. The counter electrode plays an important role in a DSSC device, which is to catalyze the triiodide/iodide (I3 −/I−) redox couple of the electrolyte. Many efforts have been devoted to reducing or\nreplacing Pt-based electrodes in DSSCs [72, 82, 183-187]. One promising approach is\nby taking advantage of carbon materials as the counter electrodes [188-191].\nDue to its unique structure, GDY shows n-type semiconductor behavior with\nmoderate bandgap. Its electron cloud density is reported to be higher than that of\ngraphene based on theoretical calculation results [193]. It could be more easily to\nform chemical bonds between GDY and Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) owing to the 3d\nunoccupied orbitals in Pt, beneficial for enhancing electron transfer and catalytic\nperformance [90]. As expected, Hao et al. [192] demonstrated the successful\npreparation of PtNPs onto GDY nanosheets by ion-beam sputtering, which endowed a\nspecial \"p-n\" structure (Figure 14a-b). The DFT calculations showed that this\n35\nstructure improved the catalytic performance and electron transfer when used as\ncounter electrode in DSSCs. The experimental results confirmed that the performance\nof PtNPs-GDY nanosheets was almost equivalent to that of metal Pt foil, and was\neven superior to that of reduced graphene oxide/PtNPs composite and PtNPs. Zhu et\nal. [194] successfully prepared GDY-doped TiO2 (P25)-based photoanodes with superior cell performance. The optimal photoanode achieved the best PCE of 8.03%,\nwhich was increased by 26.5% comparing with that of undoped cell. The reason was\nbecause the introduction of GDY increased the dye adsorption capability, accelerated\nthe electron transfer rate and reduced the charge recombination."

      "text" : "Colloidal quantum dot solar cell (CQDSC) is expected to be a leader in the next\ngeneration of photovoltaic devices because of its low cost, good stability, quantum\nsize effect and adjustable bandgap [195-202]. It is a feasible path to improve the\nperformance of CQDSC by introducing a buffer layer between the CQD active layer\nand the anode. Jin et al. [203] spin-coated GDY on PbS-EDT (EDT: 1,2-ethanedithiol)\nas an anode buffer layer to greatly improved the performance of photovoltaic devices\n(Figure 15). Compared with the reference device without GDY, the PCE increased\nfrom 9.49% to 10.64%. In addition, the Impedance spectroscopy (IS) results indicated\nthat the effective carrier lifetimes were determined to be 2.4 and 1.9 µs under\nillumination for devices with and without GD, respectivley, (corresponding values in\nthe dark were 22.8 and 20.2 µs, respectively). The longer carrier lifetime of the device\nindicated that photogenerated carriers needed more time to move toward, and\nultimately be collected by the Au anode, in consistent with the larger recombination\nresistance of the device (the diameter of the semicircle), which indicated less carrier\nrecombination inside the device. The longer carrier lifetime and larger recombination\nresistance should be induced by the improved contact between the PbS-EDT layer and\nthe Au anode. Forturnately [123, 127], GDY material can be used as an ideal electron\ntransport layer and hole transport material owing to the intrinsic hole and electron\nmobilities [143], [148]. It can be used as both dopant to enhance the electron transport\n36\nrate of ETL, and directly as the subject of hole transfer to improve the device\nperformance. Therefore, it has promising and encouraging potential in optoelectronic\ndevices, especially solar cells in the future.\nFigure 15.

      "heading" : "4. Carbyne—Linear carbon chains",
      "text" : "Since the proposal of “The era of carbon allotropes” by A. Hirsch in 2010 [204],\nthe case of “lacking allotrope” consisting of sp-hybridized carbon atoms called\ncarbyne showed a huge interest in the past [205]. The fact that sp-carbon atoms are very easily to react and crosslink to form sp2- or sp3- carbon atoms makes it a big\nchallenge to obtain very long carbon chains. A lot of controversy about whether the\ncarbyne was existed arose until the fabrication of the stable systems of polyynes: short\nsp hybridized linear carbon arrangements with end-capping groups [206]. DFT\ncalculations on model chains revealed that the transition from finite length chains\nruled by end-effects to a chain ruled by Peierls distortion (that was following the\nbehavior of an ideally infinite 1D system) occurred for chains having more than 50\ncarbon atoms [207]. In real systems, finite length effects and end-groups play a\n37\nfundamental role and drive the system to a specific degree of bond length alternation:\nthe terminal groups affect the overall wire configuration with an increasingly larger\neffect in shorter wires. Due to the difficulty in synthesis and characterization, we still\nknow very little about carbyne.\nThe ideal carbyne generally has two structures, as shown in Figure 16a [13].\nOne is called cumulene with double bonds throughout the chain (=C=C=C=C=) and\nthe other is polyyne with alternating single and triple bonds (-C≡C-C≡C-). The\n38\npolyyne, respectively. Reproduced with permission [13]. Copyright 2016 Royal Society of Chemistry. (b) Experimental and simulated images of straight carbyne and alkane. a.

Simulated images of d and g were obtained at 4 nm defocus. Reproduced with permission [208]. Copyright 2014 Elsevier.\nVarious chemical and physical strategies mainly in a bottom-up manner have\nbeen employed to produce linear carbon chains of possibly different lengths [13, 14,\n209, 210], whilst spectroscopic measurements were performed to characterize the\nstructural, vibrational and electronic properties [211]. Techniques based on physical\nvapour deposition methods depend on the rapid quenching of carbon vapour/plasma\nproduced by arc discharge/laser ablation to induce carbon clusters under\nout-of-equilibrium conditions [212-215]. While two chemical approaches are often\nexplored to synthesize a large number of sp carbon chains terminated with different\nmolecular groups. One is the polymerization strategy [216] and the other targets\nmolecules with a defined length and specific endgroups [217-219]. On the other hand,\nthe top-down methods are based on pulling a carbon nanotube or graphene in order to\nform a wire as predicted by theoretical studies. For example, polyynes can be formed\nusing Pt atoms on graphene [208] and the formation of Pt-endcapped 1D wires has\nbeen observed by TEM images (Figure 16b) where Pt atoms acted as nucleation sites\nof additional carbon atoms. Nevertheless, the structure stability is still a key issue as\nexplosions are possible upon isolation of sp-carbon wires in the solid state, especially\nin the case of H-terminated polyynes [205].\nTheoretical predictions indicate that carbyne is a very promising material. A brief\noverview of some outstanding properties is predicted as follows. First, the effective surface of carbyne is estimated to exceed 13 000 m2 g-1 [220], which is four times\nhigher than the theoretical value of graphene. Benefitted from the strong σ-bonds,\ncarbyne probably endows the best mechanical strength, a very high value of Young’s modulus (up to 32 TPa) and a specific stiffness of about 109 N m kg-1 [2]. These\nvalues are much higher than those of other carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes,\n39\ngraphene and even diamonds. In addition, the thermal conductivity of carbyne is excellent, what is estimated to exceed 20 080 kW m-1 K-1 for cumulenes and polyynes at room temperature. Compared with graphene (5 kW m-1 K-1) and carbon nanotubes (3.5 kW m-1 K-1) which exhibit the best thermal conductivity known at present; the\ngap is quite obvious. Such superhigh thermal conductivity is attributed to high phonon\nfrequencies and long phonon mean free path allowing ballistic thermal transport up to\nthe micron-scale [221]. As for electronic properties, as mentioned above, cumulene is\nexpected to be a metal while polyyne is a semiconductor with large electron mobility\nand peculiar conductance behavior. The molar absorptivity has been measured for\nlong polyynes showing an increase with the chain length. For polyyne of 20 carbon atoms, the experimental value reaches 7.5 ×105 L-1 mol-1 cm [210]. In a word, the\nsp-carbon-based nanoscale system seems to have infinite potential and much work is\nneeded in order to unveil the potential of this “new” member in the vast family of\ncarbon-based materials."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "In summary, we have summarized the recent developments regarding 0D GQDs\nwith sp2-hybridized carbon atoms and 2D GDYs with sp- and sp2-hybridization for\nenergy storage and conversion applications including supercapacitors, LIBs and solar\ncells. An overview of the promising properties of 1D carbyne with sp-hybridization is\ngiven. Although a series of functional systems derived from GQDs and GDYs had\nbeen successfully constructed and applied in the energy fields, many challenges still\nneed to be explored. For GQDs, plenty of synthetic methods have been reported,\nwhich results in huge heterogeneity and the fact that the PL properties of GQDs are\nintriguingly determined by numerous parameters, making the tunable luminescence\nmechanism waits discovery. Besides, how to improve the quantum yield and\nfluorescence intensity are also needs to be solved. A low-cost effective approach is\ngreatly desirable to produce massive GQDs. It is worth mentioning that the severe\nsafety hazards for the electrochemical energy storage devices caused by the battery\nshort-circuit, thermal runaway, and failure with possible explosion or fire are critical\n40\nand challenge issues for practical applications. Even so, there is no doubt that the\npractical promising prospects of GQDs are very bright, and their applications will\ndefinitely alleviate energy problems. The high electron mobility of GQDs could\nimprove the conductivity and greatly facilitate the charge transport, which is a big\nadvantage for supercapacitors and LIBs. This feature even possibly enables GQDs as\na suitable hole conductor in DSSCs. The introduction of GQDs as an electrode\nmaterial is rather appealing due to the affordable accessibility of ion\nadsorption/desorption derived from large surface area and abundant surface sites, as\nwell as the effective agglomeration suppression and volume expansion alleviation.\nWith the development of new assembling methods and techniques, multidimensional\nsystems and the hybrid/composition of GQDs will further benefit the energy-related\ndevices. For example, in heterojunction solar cells, modified GQDs with an improved\nenergy alignment could theoretically work as an electron donor as well, showing the\npossibility that charge transfer may take place even between two types of GQDs and\ntherefore forming an interesting junction completely based on GQDs.\nThe research on GDYs is still at the infant stage although there are numerous\npublished studies on related topics. What we know is only the tip of the iceberg. So\nfar, the preparation of high quality single- or few-layer GDYs has been crucial.\nSpecific characterization techniques are highly required to analyze the GDY\nstructures such as percentage of C-C triple bonds. GDY shows competitive properties\nand exhibits greater potential than many carbon materials for application in energy\nsustainability, such as wide interlayer spacing, large specific surface area, unique pore\nstructure and excellent electrical conductivity. However, more efforts are needed to\nfurther improve the electrode/device performance. In addition, it is worth noticing that\nGY is a class of materials and research studies should not be limited to GDY.\nDeveloping new members of the GY family is also attractive.\nEven though the existence of carbyne as the ‘third carbon allotrope’ is\ncontroversial, sp-carbon nanostructures can be synthesized in stable forms and are\nsubsequently investigated now. The strong structure–property relationships allow the\ntuning of optical and electronic behavior over a large variety of desired applications.\n41\nThe structure and the functional properties can be designed by controlling the number\nof carbon atoms and endgroups, which provides the possibility to adjust the properties\nranging from metallic through semiconducting to insulating for new nanosystems. It\nwill be rather appealing for carbon science and have great potential in nano/molecular\nelectronics and optoelectronics fields. However, although the seemingly limitless\npotential of sp-carbon-based nanosystems has been suggested in many theoretical\nstudies, only a small part of the experimental realm has been obtained. Much work is\nstill needed to unveil the potential of this “new” member in the vast carbon material\nfamily.\nAcknowledgement.\nY. Wang and P. Yang contribute equally to this work.
