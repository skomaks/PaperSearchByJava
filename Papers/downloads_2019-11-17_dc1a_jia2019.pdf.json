Such electrode containing pores between nanostructures imparts large-area contact with electrolyte, improved electrical conductivity with current collector, and good structural stability and mechanical integrity. Herein, we report, for the first time, outstanding cycling stability and rate performance of CuO electrode in LIBs. CuO nano-labyrinths (NLs) composed of densely interlaced nanowalls on Cu foil are crafted via a facile solution-based etching process. It is notable that macroscopic and mesoscopic pores are found to ubiquitously present among the adjacent CuO nanowalls and within the nanowall, respectively (i.e., forming hierarchically porous CuO NLs). Intriguingly, CuO NLs anodes yield an ultralong cycling stability, that is, a specific capacity of 320mA h g−1 after 800 cycles without the capacity fading at high current density of 1 A g−1, and an outstanding high-rate performance (up to 30 C). This is a direct consequence of unique synergistic effects of hierarchical pores and interlaced nanostructures. Moreover, a further enhancement of reversible capacity is achieved by deposition Si thin film on the surface of CuO NLs. Such interlaced nanowall-containing structures with hierarchical pores represent an important type of architectures that underpin the development of electrode materials for long cycle-life energy storage devices."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Widely used portable electronics, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage devices have driven the need for high-rate Li-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density and good environment compatibility [1–7]. As key parameters to evaluate the lithium storage performance of electrode, cycling stability and rate performance can be greatly affected by drastic changes in structure and volume during the charge-discharge processes [8–12]. Copper oxide is one of the important transition metal oxides, which exhibits promising potential for use in energy storage and conversion [13–15], particularly in LIBs. CuO is recognized as a promising anode material for LIBs owing to its relatively large theoretical capacity (670mA h g−1), high abundance, low cost and ease in preparation with diverse shapes (e.g., hollow nanoparticles, mesoporous particles, etc.) [16–20]. However, pure CuO electrodes were found to experience a low capacity at high C-rates and\ndeteriorative cycling stability, which is due primarily to intrinsically low conductivity and morphological collapse. Much effort has been centered on improving the electrical conductivity of CuO anodes, such as the introduction of carbon materials [21,22] and the development of binder-free electrodes [23,24]. CuO electrodes have poor cyclability due partly to the pronounced volume expansion (~ 174%) upon the repetitive lithiation/delithiation process. In addition, the commonly used organic binder, that is, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) leads to poor stability of electrodes owing to its swelling in common electrolyte [25]. Various methods have been adopted to solve the cyclability problem of CuO. For example, CuO nanostructures prepared by metal organic framework (MOF)-based approach exhibited a ~90% of retention of initial reversible capacity after 40 cycles due to its porous structures [26]. CuO nanorod arrays produced directly on Cu foils displayed enhanced rate capability and cycling ability [27].\nIt is important to note that one effective strategy to greatly increase\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.081 Received 4 December 2018; Received in revised form 30 January 2019; Accepted 30 January 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

In this context, nanomaterials with porous structures (e.g., micro-, meso- or macro-porous) have been investigated as electrodes to improve the stability of electrochemical performance by alleviating the strain and volume expansion during the repeated Li+ insertion and extraction. Additionally, porous nanostructured electrodes also exhibit high rate performance due to the easy access of electrolyte to the electrode surface and the shortened Li+ diffusion and charge transfer pathway [30–33] as in copious past works [34–37]. It is also noteworthy that compared to the powder-form materials, electrode materials comprising an array of aligned nanostructures directly grown on conductive substrate carry several practical advantages: first, improved charge transfer efficiency because of the vectorial electron transport route; second, easy electrolyte penetration due to the void space between neighboring nanostructures; third, accommodation of the volume expansion during the ion insertion owing to the interspaces between the arrayed nanostructures; finally, bypass of the exfoliation of active materials as a result of their good adhesion to current collector, that is, conductive substrate as noted above (e.g., 3D graphene) [38–40]. Furthermore, arrayed structures containing interconnected nanosheets or nanofibers may effectively accommodate the strain induced by the volume change during the lithiation/delithiation process, resulting in improved cycling stability of electrodes [41,42].\nHerein, we report a simple yet robust route to hierarchically porous CuO nano-labyrinths (NLs) comprising nearly vertically aligned, interlaced CuO nanowalls that are directly grown on Cu foil for LIBs with ultralong cycle life. As these CuO nanowalls are in intimate contact with Cu foil substrate, they can be exploited directly as an integrated electrode for LIBs, thus eliminating the need for the addition of electrochemically inactive conductive agent (e.g., carbon) or polymer binders (e.g., PVDF) as well as the application of current collectors widely used for the assembly of LIBs. Another remarkable feature of this type of electrodes is their hierarchically porous structures possessing mesoscopic pores within CuO nanowall and microscopic hollow interior between adjacent CuO nanowalls to relax the volume change during cycling, thereby achieving the improved cycling stability of CuO anode. Moreover, interlaced CuO NLs via direct growth on copper substrate is structurally stable, thus relieving the pulverization during cycling. Taken together, CuO NLs anode yields a high capacity over 300mA h g−1 at the 1 A g−1 rate after 800 cycles as a result of the synergy of hierarchical pores and interlaced NLs, representing the first report on the outstanding long-term cycling stability of CuO anode materials at high current density. Further deposition of Si thin film over CuO NLs (i.e., forming CuO/Si composite electrode) displays an enhanced reversible capacity of 450mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 500 cycles, signifying that CuO NLs possess excellent structural integrity and stability, rendering the templated creation of composite electrodes with long cycling stability."

      "heading" : "3. Results and discussion",
      "text" : "CuO NLs were crafted by engraving Cu foils that function as not only a copper source for producing CuO NLs but also an intimate substrate to support them (see Experimental Section in Supporting Information). On the basis of SEM images and XRD patterns acquired at different reaction (i.e., etching in the alkaline solution) times (Figs. S1 and S2), the growth mechanism of CuO NLs can be proposed as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. First, high-density, long and randomly oriented Cu (OH)2 nanowires are formed over a large area on the Cu foil due to the use of high-concentration sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (Fig. S1a; panel (a) in Fig. 1). As Cu(OH)2 is a metastable phase as evidenced by the time-dependent XRD study, it is easily transformed into more stable CuO under the alkaline condition according to the following chemical reaction:\nCu(OH)2 + 2OH- → [Cu(OH)4]2- → CuO + H2O\nSpecifically, the intermediate product [Cu(OH)4]2- complexes may first form on the top of Cu(OH)2 nanowires as the concentration of NaOH in this region is likely to be much higher than that on the bottom, followed by the conversion of [Cu(OH)4]2- complexes into CuO.\nInterestingly, as the etching of Cu foil progresses, CuO nanowires grow longer. Thus, the falling of long CuO nanowires occurs driven by the formation of the [Cu(OH)4]2- complexes noted above and their subsequent conversion into CuO that may change the crystallization process of CuO, leading to the bundling of adjacent falling CuO nanowires (panel (b) in Fig. 1), which can be clearly seen in Fig. S1b. As the falling direction of CuO nanowires is random, the orientation of CuO nanowalls is varied. As a result, macropores are yielded between these nanowalls. It is not surprising that the continuous transformation of Cu (OH)2 nanowires into CuO and the falling and bundling (i.e., self-assembly) of the formed CuO nanowires results in the densely packed CuO nanowires with mesopore situated between them (Fig. S1c; panel (c) in Fig. 1). Consequently, CuO NLs comprise interlaced nanowalls\nwith macro- and mesopores (i.e., hierarchically porous structures; panel (d) in Fig. 1) are densely populated over the entire copper substrate, as shown in Fig. S1d. It is notable that in-situ film formation renders intimate contact and adhesion between the CuO NLs and Cu foil used as the current collector [43].\nThe crystal structure of CuO NLs was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1a, the diffraction peaks at 35.6° and 38.7° can be indexed to the monoclinic CuO phase (JCPDS 05-0661). The other two strong diffraction peaks at 43.3° and 50.4° are originated from the Cu foil. The size and density of CuO nanowalls can be easily controlled by varying the concentration of NaOH in the etching solution (Fig. S3). Fig. 2b shows a low-magnification scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of as-obtained products. Clearly, CuO NLs display a network-like structure interconnected by CuO nanowalls on the Cu foil over a large area. The majority of nanowalls are orientated vertically to the copper substrate without agglomeration. A close-up shown as an inset in Fig. 2b reveals macropores (marked with red dash circles) formed between adjacent nanowalls, which facilitate the Li+ insertion/ extraction and the electrolyte penetration. The average wall thickness is approximately 20 nm. Such unique nanostructure offers the rough surface that increases the effective surface area for charge storage. Furthermore, CuO nanowalls are interlaced rather than independent of each other, thereby imparting mechanical stability of electrode materials. The surface of CuO nanowalls are rough and mesoporous (marked with red dashed circles), as revealed by TEM (Fig. 2c), consistent with the SEM measurement. It is interesting to note that the mesoporous structures of CuO nanowalls may be resulted from incomplete aggregation (i.e., self-assembly) of nanowires as clearly evidenced in Fig. 2c where the ends of each nanowire within the nanowall can be seen. Fig. 2d displays a representative high-resolution TEM image of an individual nanowall. The 0.25 nm lattice spacing corresponds well to the (002) lattice plane of monoclinic CuO. A typical cross-sectional SEM image of CuO NLs on Cu foils is shown in Fig. 2e, where CuO nanowalls are ~1.0 µm in height and densely grown, vertically aligned over the copper substrate. Taken together, hierarchically porous interlaced CuO NLs were yielded. Compared to two-dimensional (2D) array consisting of separated CuO nanowires or nanowalls, these CuO NLs are mechanically robust, and may thus enhance the long-term cycling stability, which is a crucial parameter for practical devices.\nIn this context, the electrochemical performance of CuO NLs as the anode for LIBs was evaluated by a suite of tests to demonstrate the advantageous features of hierarchically porous 2D structures of CuO\nNLs. As a reference, the electrochemical properties of CuO nanosheet powders prepared by a facile solution method [44] were also conducted. Fig. 3a shows the first eight cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the CuO NLs electrode carried out at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 to identify the electrochemical reactions. In the first negative scanning, three main reductive peaks located at 2.16, 1.28 and 0.79 V were observed, which can be attributed to the formation of the intermediate CuO phase, the subsequent conversion into Cu2O and Cu, respectively. In the reverse anodic scan, the peaks at 1.44, 2.54 and 2.84 V correspond to the partial decomposition of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and the formation of Cu2O and CuO [45]. The CV curves overlap in the subsequent cathodic and anodic sweeps, confirming a good reversibility for the redox reaction once the initial structure rearrangement is completed. The galvanostatic charge/discharge voltage profiles were further examined over a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V at a current density of 100mA g−1, as shown in Fig. S4a. The multiple plateaus in the charge curves demonstrate that multiple reactions take place during the conversion reaction between CuO and Li+, correlating well with the results of CV measurements described above. The initial discharge and charge capacities of CuO NLs are measured to be 978.4 and 650.0 mA h g−1 with a Coulombic efficiency of 66.4%. The capacity loss in the initial cycle can be attributed to the electrolyte decomposition and formation of SEI layers. Subsequently, reversible capacities are nearly constant and maintain approximately 650mA h g−1 with Coulombic efficiencies approaching 100%, attesting to the improved contact between the electrode and electrolyte, and the stable, hierarchically porous 2D structures of CuO NLs.\nThe rate capabilities of CuO NLs and CuO nanosheet powders were also compared at different C rates (1 C = 670mA g−1). Fig. 3b details the current-dependent capacity, potential plateau, and needed charge time. The self-supported CuO NLs anode delivers the reversible capacities of 400, 390, 340, 255, 160, and 76mA h g−1 at the current rates of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 C, respectively, reflecting much better performance than those of CuO nanosheet powders. When the rate further increases from 20 to 30 C, the anode capacity remains nearly unchanged, signifying a promising potential of CuO NLs as anode for LIBs with outstanding high rate capability. Moreover, it takes only 13.6 s (76mA h g−1 ÷ (30 *670mA g−1) = 13.6 s) for full charge at such an extremely high current density. It is notable that few studies have reported the battery performance using CuO anodes under the current density of 30 C. Importantly, when the applied current returns to 0.5 C, the specific capacity still reaches 505mA h g−1, indicating the good\nreversibility and nearly no damage of hierarchically porous CuO NLs during the fast charging and discharging processes [46]. We note that the superior rate capability is resulted from the hierarchically porous, interlaced structures of CuO NLs with a large free space which facilitates better wetting of CuO NLs by electrolyte and the rapid Li+ transport across the electrode/electrolyte interface [47,48].\nTo demonstrate the wettability of electrodes, the contact angle tests were conducted by dropping the electrolyte vertically onto CuO NLs and CuO nanosheet powder electrodes, respectively (Fig. 4). The contact angle of the CuO NLs electrode is 29.5°, which is much lower than that of the CuO nanosheet powder counterpart (76.5°), indicating a markedly improved wettability for CuO NLs due to its hierarchically\nporous structures, thus imparting the sufficient contact between the electrolyte and electrode. The introduction of surface roughness will improve the wettability. The mesopores formed on the CuO nanowalls significantly increased the surface roughness, as confirmed by the TEM imaging. Thus, the presence of mesopores may account for the superior wettability. In addition, the macropores existed between different nanowalls are beneficial to the penetration of the electrolyte, and thus the wettability of CuO NLs was enhanced. Moreover, the presence of nanowalls in CuO NLs effectively shortens the transport length for Li+, manifesting the excellent capacity retention at continuously varied current densities.\nIn addition to rate performance, the cycling stability at high current densities is another decisive characteristic for grid energy storage yet still challenging for LIBs due to the structure instability of active materials and the side reactions occurred between the electrode and electrolyte. Fig. 5 illustrates the correlation between the capacitance retention and cycle numbers at a relatively high current density of 1 A g−1. Notably, the specific capacity increases steadily up to a maximum of approximately 330mA h g−1 over the initial 100 cycles, due possibly to the delayed wetting of electrolyte into porous CuO NLs as well as the gradual formation of new reversible SEI layer [35]. After that, the capacity remains at 320mA h g−1 after 800 cycles, corresponding to a 97.0% capacity retention with a Coulombic efficiency close to 100% during the course of battery operation. It is noteworthy that few copper oxides exhibit such an ultralong cycle life (up to 800 cycles), and the present stability is the best one reported to date. In sharp contrast, the\ncycling performance of CuO nanosheet powders tested at the same current density of 1 A g−1 shows the significantly decreased specific capacity and retains only 100mA h g−1 after 250 cycles, indicating that the hierarchically porous structures greatly improve the cycle life. The comparison of the electrochemical performances of as-prepared CuO NLs with some previously reported CuO anode materials of various nanostructures for LIBs is summarized in Table S1.\nTo further confirm their structural stability, CuO NLs were coated with a thin layer of Si. Si is widely recognized as a promising anode material due to its ultrahigh theoretical capacity (4200mA h g−1) [49]. While, the huge volume change during the lithium insertion/extraction restricts its commercial applications. To this end, in our study, a thin layer of Si was deposited on the surface of CuO NLs via radio frequency (rf) sputtering to overcome the mechanical rupture during the volume changes of Si. Remarkably, as-prepared CuO/Si composite electrodes sustain an excellent and stable specific capacity of 450mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 500 cycles (Fig. 5b).\nThe high stability of CuO/Si composite anode can be attributed to the unique structural design of CuO NLs. First, the CuO nanowalls, which functioned as the core of the CuO/Si composite grown directly from the copper foil, facilitated the charge transport from the less conductive amorphous Si to the current collector. Moreover, the interlaced nanowalls with unique hierarchically pores rendered the structural reinforcement to overcome the mechanical breaking during the volume change of Si. In addition, the macropores among nanowalls can accommodate the large volume change of Si during cycling. The\ncomposition and morphology of the composites are shown in Fig. 6. Clearly, CuO/Si composites preserve the interlaced nanowall structure of CuO NLs, thereby rendering stable capacity of the composite electrodes. Thus, CuO NLs may stand out as a potential candidate to yield composite electrodes possessing both high stability and large capacity.\nWe now turn our attention to rationalize CuO NLs with unique hierarchically porous, interlaced nanowall structures offering impressive electrochemical performances. First, the direct growth of CuO nanowalls presents an intimate and robust adhesion to the Cu foil greatly decreases the ion transport resistance, thereby providing fast electron-transport to the current collector (Fig. 7a). To further understand the charge transfer resistance property, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the identical cell freshly assembled and experienced 400 and 800 cycles were investigated (Fig. 7b). The semicircle in the high-frequency region is associated with the charge transfer resistance. From the Nyquist plots, it is clear that the semicircle progressively decreases from the 1st to 800th cycle, signifying the transport of electrons and ions was significantly facilitated due to the formation of SEI film and the activation process during cycling, which in turn imparts considerably improved electrochemical properties [50]. The depressed semicircle after cycling is believed to be due to the unique interlaced structure with hierarchical pores that facilitate intimate contact between the CuO NLs and the electrolyte. The strong anchoring to the Cu substrate enables intimate electrical contact of CuO NLs and the current collector, and offers high tolerance for the successive volume change of CuO upon cycling. This leads to a fast electron transfer and a better cycling stability, which is reflected by high rate capability (Fig. 3b) and ultralong cycle stability (Fig. 5a). In addition, the direct growth of CuO NLs on the Cu foil dispenses with the need for polymer binders as in copious past work. Such a binder-free electrode can effectively avoid undesirable interfaces and possible side reactions that reduce the charge conductivity, thereby leading to a high rate capability and an improved cycling stability. Moreover, more parts of active materials can be exposed to the electrolyte due to the removal of binder from the electrode, expanding more surfaces for electrochemical reaction.\nSecond, the judiciously constructed hierarchically porous electrode not only promotes a good access of the electrode surface to electrolyte as well as charge transfer, but also adequately accommodates the volume changes during the lithiation/delithiation process, benefiting the long cycle life and high rate capability. To further investigate the\nporosity of CuO nanowalls, nitrogen cryosorption measurements were conducted. The N2 absorption isotherm shows a type-IV isotherm with a distinct hysteresis loop, indicating a mesoporous structure of CuO nanowalls (Fig. 7c). The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda pore size distribution (inset in Fig. 7c) calculated from the adsorption branch demonstrates the pore sizes are in the range of 5–50 nm, confirming the formation of mesopores.\nThird, in addition to the hierarchically porous characteristic, the interlaced nanowall structures can also virtually buffer the volume changes and retain the mechanical integrity of the CuO NLs anode upon the repeated Li+ intercalation and deintercalation, thus rendering the prolonged cycling stability of electrode. As noted above, Fig. 7d shows the SEM image of CuO NLs after an 800 discharge-charge cycle, where the retention of both interlaced 2D nanowall structures and vertical CuO nanowalls of similar size is clearly evident. Moreover, the CuO NLs electrode is found to uphold its original flexibility and no CuO nanowalls are detached from the Cu foil after 800 cycles (Fig. S5)."

      "text" : "In summary, we developed a simple yet robust strategy for crafting hierarchically porous CuO NLs composed of densely interlaced nanowalls directly grown on Cu foil that can be employed as binder-free electrode for LIBs, eliminating the addition of binder and current collector. This hierarchically porous electrode delivers excellent cycle life and high rate performance as a direct consequence of an array of advantageous structural features, that is, vigorous contact between the anode material (CuO NLs) and the current collector (Cu foil) enabling high electrical conductivity, good mechanical integrity due to the interconnected nanowalls, ample space for accommodating volume expansion during charge-discharge cycles, plentiful electro-active sites available for electrochemical reaction because of no additional binder, and shortened Li-ion diffusion distance owing to thin nanowalls. The deposition of thin Si layer on CuO NL yields CuO/Si composites, exhibiting enhanced reversible capacity and high stability. Such porous yet stable nanostructured materials may be exploited as active components or templates for various other applications in energy conversion and storage, such as supercapacitors, solar cells, photocatalytic hydrogen generation, and photodetectors."

Such electrode containing pores between nanostructures imparts large-area contact with electrolyte, improved electrical conductivity with current collector, and good structural stability and mechanical integrity. Herein, we report, for the first time, outstanding cycling stability and rate performance of CuO electrode in LIBs. CuO nano-labyrinths (NLs) composed of densely interlaced nanowalls on Cu foil are crafted via a facile solution-based etching process. It is notable that macroscopic and mesoscopic pores are found to ubiquitously present among the adjacent CuO nanowalls and within the nanowall, respectively (i.e., forming hierarchically porous CuO NLs). Intriguingly, CuO NLs anodes yield an ultralong cycling stability, that is, a specific capacity of 320mA h g after 800 cycles without the capacity fading at high current density of 1 A g, and an outstanding high-rate performance (up to 30 C). This is a direct consequence of unique synergistic effects of hierarchical pores and interlaced nanostructures. Moreover, a further enhancement of reversible capacity is achieved by deposition Si thin film on the surface of CuO NLs. Such interlaced nanowall-containing structures with hierarchical pores represent an important type of architectures that underpin the development of electrode materials for long cycle-life energy",
