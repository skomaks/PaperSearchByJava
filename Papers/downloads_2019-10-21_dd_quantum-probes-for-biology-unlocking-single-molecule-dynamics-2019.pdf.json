This quantum echnology revolution will be enabled by quantum systems and robes which can be coherently controlled and manipulated with xtreme precision. The emergence of solid state quantum systems ased on defect centres in semiconductor materials has provided a obust platform to build and develop novel quantum sensors. The perating principles of quantum sensors are governed by the laws f quantum mechanics and bring about several advantages when ompared to their classical counterparts, for example in the size nd sensitivity of the sensor itself. One interesting application area n which quantum sensors are being actively pursued is nanoscale\nagnetic resonance spectroscopy and the characterisation of indiidual molecules and nuclei. The dynamics and reaction kinetics f single molecules are of enormous interest in biology: from DNA oding and transcription through to energy production in our cells. ver the past two decades, tremendous advances in imaging techiques have enabled the study and characterisation of individual roteins and biomolecules. Such techniques include: X-ray crysallography [1], Cryo-EM [2], and Optical Tweezers [3], to name\nfew. Whilst these techniques provide unprecedented access to omplex molecular structure and behaviour, they are limited in heir ability to operate under physiological conditions. X-ray crysallography, for example, often requires both crystallisation of the arget protein and multiple recordings from replicate biomolecules o capture an overall molecular fingerprint.

Therefore, one of the grand challenges for single molecule imaging is to capture dynamic information from single molecules in their natural state. In this endeavour, magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques are leading the way. Magnetic resonance techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) interrogate the magnetic properties of molecules as determined by their composition and coordination environment. Structural NMR allows the chemical composition and structure of ensembles of molecules to be determined based on the chemical shift experienced by nuclei. At present, however, state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers require 1011 or 1012 nuclear spins to generate sufficient signal to noise ratios for typical acquistion times < hours. A similar story exists for ESR spectrometers, in which molecular dynamics are revealed by attaching electron spin labels, such as nitroxides, to particular components of a molecule, termed site directed electron spin labelling (SDSL). Given the magnetic moment of an electron spin is a factor of ∼ 1000 times larger than nuclear spins, the detection limit of traditional ESR spectrometers remains constrained at ∼108-109 electron spins under ambient conditions in which molecular dynamics can be observed. Therefore, a transformative shift in technology is needed in terms of magnetic sensitivity to realise magnetic resonance studies of individual molecules. Quantum technology, and quantum sensors in particular, offer a promising approach to this challenging problem and have made staggering progress over the past 5–10 years [4–8].\nOne promising solid state quantum sensing platform in this regard is based on atomic defects in diamond known as nega-\nt i c p a d s t p n a a t r t t a m\no S s d n t t a fi u w a i T t m\nnterface showing the green excitation used to excite the NV centres and paramagn pins below the diamond surface.

The NV centre n diamond comprises a substitutional nitrogen atom with an adjaent vacancy aligned along the <111> crystallographic axes. This articular defect can be engineered into the diamond lattice by ccelerating nitrogen ions into the diamond or via chemical vapour eposition techniques. The ground state of the NV centre is a spin 1 ystem whose spin levels are optically addressable. Magnetic detecion in these systems is thus achieved by optically monitoring the opulations and quantum phases of these spin states under magetic dipole-dipole coupling to target molecules. One of the most ttractive features of these quantum probes is that they operate t room temperature and can be engineered in close proximity to he diamond surface (less than 10 nm) leading to nanoscale spatial esolution [10]. The intimate contact between the NV probes and arget molecules results in single electron spin sensitivity at disances of order ∼10 nm [8]. This sensitivity, spatial resolution and mbient operation is ideal for SDSL studies of single proteins and olecules. The first demonstration of single site directed electron spin resnance (ESR) using an NV quantum probe came in 2015 when hi et al. used techniques adapted from magnetic resonance pectroscopy (double electron-electron resonance or DEER) to emonstrate the direct detection and spectroscopy of a single itroxide spin label attached to a single spindle checkpoint proein (MAD2) [11]. Spectroscopy of this individual protein allowed he orientation of a single spin label to be determined, marking n important first step for future functional studies targeting conrmation changes of individual proteins. This work was followed p recently with a study on single DNA hybridisation [12]. In this ork the Du group utilised nanostructured diamond pillars, which ct to enhance the NV fluorescence collection efficiency, in order to mprove the acquistion time for a single spin label ESR spectrum. his speed-up is critical for room temperature applications where he spin labels are prone to ionisation from the aqueous environ-\nent, as well as photo-ionisation from the optical pumping of the\nu2+ molecules diffusing through the sensing volume. Red arrows represent the NV m quantum-based ESR of ∼1000 Cu2+ molecules compared to bulk ESR ensemble\nNV centres. Additional challenges faced by this form of nanoscale ESR include the co-localisation of the single molecules with respect to the NV atomic sensors. Current studies are performed on a statistical basis and rely on the NV centres being sufficiently close to the proteins or molecules of interest.\nA possible solution to the localisation of molecular targets may lie in the development of quantum-based ESR microscopes. Instead of interrogating a single NV centre in diamond, an alternate approach is to engineer NV centres uniformly across the diamond surface to create a 2D near surface sensing layer which can be addressed and readout in parallel using conventional CCD cameras. These 2D NV sensing arrays have been used for electron/nuclear spin imaging applications [13–15] and provide a possible solution to the localisation of the target molecules with respect to the NV probe, since the average NV spacing in these layers can be of order 20 nm. At present, the imaging resolution in these quantumbased ESR microscopes is limited by optical diffraction to around ∼ 300 nm, however super resolution imaging techniques [16] have demonstrated possible pathways toward ESR nanoscopy which would enable single molecule reconstruction of individual spin labels. Another important consideration in the development of ESR microscopy is an appropriate sensing protocol which can operate over large fields of view to provide high-resolution ESR spectra over MHz-GHz spectral range. Hall et al. identified a microwave-free, ESR measurement protocol using NV centres in diamond which uses an applied magnetic field to Zeeman split the energy states of the NV to cover this measurement bandwidth [17]. The applied magnetic field modifies the paramagnetic ground and excited states of the NV centres to tune them into resonance with target paramagnetic molecules. When the resonant condition is reached the target molecules and NV centre exchange magnetisation efficiently, resulting in a strong reduction in the spin lattice relaxation time (T1) of the NV centres. By implementing this approach using the 2D NV sensing arrays, the ambient ESR spectrum of hexaaqua copper (Cu2+) molecules in aqueous solution was obtained with\nno Tod\nd t\nm t n p p e f s i t u a j m D t h m fi d p t t n a s b\nR\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\nresonance spectroscopy techniques to study the magnetic properties of biological systems.

Simpson / Na\niffraction limited spatial resolution (Fig. 1) and spin sensitivity in he zeptomol ∼1000 spins/pixel regime [15].\nOne of the current hurdles facing quantum-based ESR icroscopy is the introduction of paramagnetic defects, both at he surface and within the NV sensing layer, resulting from the itrogen implantation used to engineer the sensing array. These aramagnetic defects have g-factors of ∼2 and, due to their close roximity, can quench the NV relaxation time which reduces the lectron spin sensitivity to targets with g-factors of 2, most notably ree radicals. It is anticipated that alternate fabrication strategies uch as chemical vapour deposition, together with specific annealng strategies to remove these parasitic spins [18], will overcome his issue. Finally, for near surface NV centres the sensing volme is limited (∼10 × 10 × 100 nm3) by the T1 and T2 relaxation nd coherence times, respectively. Therefore, the NV centre is subect to statistical variations in the magnetic signal from individual\nolecules in aqueous solution, this is particularly problematic for EER protocols that are susceptible to orientation changes within\nhe sensing volume. A promising zero magnetic field approach as been proposed to eliminate this orientation dependence, by atching the NV driving frequency to the target molecules hyperne transition frequency [19]. Such protocols will be critical to the evelopment and future application of ESR microscopy in studying rocesses such as cell metabolism, and the production and reacivity of organic free radicals. The maturation of quantum sensing echniques into a robust platform for nanoscale magnetic resoance spectroscopy represents an exciting time for both quantum nd biomolecular scientists. In the coming years, we hope to see ingle molecule dynamics unravelled by these sensitive quantumased ESR and NMR microscopes.\neferences\n[1] B. von Ardenne, M. Mechelke, H. Grubmüller, Nat.
