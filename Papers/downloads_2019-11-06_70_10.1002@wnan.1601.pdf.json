      "heading" : "1 | INTRODUCTION ABOUT COMPLEX NANOSTRUCTURE",
      "text" : "This is a structure-controlled world. Complex structures are playing their important roles at all the material scales. No matter how complex the structures are, they can be viewed as a derivative or a combination of the most fundamental core-shell (or core-sheath) and side-by-side (or Janus) structures (Yu, Li, Zhang, & Williams, 2017). Shown in Figure 1 are several typical examples. The earth is always one side black and one side white to comprise a side-by-side whole (Figure 1a), whereas it has a multiple-layer core-shell inner structure, as indicated in the inset of Figure 1a. An egg has a quadruple structure from the hard sell to membrane protein, to egg white and yolk (Figure 1b), but there are always a gasbag side-by-side with egg white. In the micro-world, things are similar for materials from a molecule to a living cell. A cell always has the inner–outer coreshell structure but the cell membrane is a typical Janus double-lecithin structure (Figure 1c). As for many molecules, such as a\nWIREs Nanomed Nanobiotechnol. 2019;e1601. wires.wiley.com/nanomed © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 1 of 11 https://doi.org/10.1002/wnan.1601\nhydrogen chloride molecule in Figure 1d, it can be viewed as a side-by-side structure, but the chlorine atom should have the core-shell structure with the electron clouds surrounding its nucleus (the bottom-left inset of Figure 1d).\nInspired by nature, people are creating new materials through manipulation of their inner structures, which is particularly popular in the nanomaterial field (Zhao & Jiang, 2009). Nanostructure and nanodevices act as more and more as the key elements to promote the fast developments of nanomaterials to generate nanoeffects for functional applications, rather than the previous nanosize. It is so important of nanostructures that “In nanoscience, the ability to make new structures enables new science and technology. The ways nanomaterials are made can be classified according to what determines the final structure of the material” was declared (Isaacoff & Brown, 2017). Although the most common core-shell and Janus nanostructures have been broadly reported in literature both through “top-down” and “bottom-up” manner (Ghosh Chaudhuri & Paria, 2012; Walther & Müller, 2013), very limited publications can found about the complex nanostructures with multiple compartments. Although several publications have reported the possibilities of creating core multishell heterostructures using the growth of crystalline overlayers on nanocrystals (Lauhon, Gudiksen, Wang, & Lieber, 2002), and of creating Janus core-shell nanostructures using an in-fiber microfluid instability (Kaufman et al., 2012), both the complex nanostructures and also their preparation methods are extremely scarce. The reasons should be attributed to difficulty of creating complex nanostructures using the traditional methods. Today, as the fast developments of electrospinning, it is obvious that the multiple fluid electrospinning can provide powerful tools for generating different kinds of complex nanostructures in a simple one-step straightforward “top-down” process (Han, Sherman, Filocamo, & Steckl, 2017)."

      "heading" : "2 | THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF MULTIPLE-FLUID ELECTROSPINNING",
      "text" : "Electrospinning, as one of the most important electrohydrodynamic atomization methods, is developing along two directions presently, just as its peer electrospraying (K. Wang et al., 2018; K. Wang, Wen, Yu, Yang, & Zhang, 2018; Z.-P. Liu et al., 2018). One is the scale production of nanofibers for potential industrial and commercial applications (Vass et al., 2019). The other is expanding its capability of generating complex nanostructures, from the fundamental core-shell and Janus\nFIGURE 1 Complex structure at all material scales: (a) The black-white Janus earth with multiple-layer coreshell structure (the bottom-left inset); (b) the multiple-layer structure of an egg; (c) the multiple-layer core-shell structure of a cell with the well-known Janus lipid membranes; (d) a Janus structure of HCl molecule with coreshell of the inner atom structure (the bottom-left inset)\nnanostructures to the tri-layer (Kalra, Lee, Park, Marquez, & Joo, 2009) and quad-layer nanofibers (Labbaf, Ghanbar, Stride, & Edirisinghe, 2014), to the multilayer Janus microfibers (Bhaskar, Hitt, Chang, & Lahann, 2009; Bhaskar & Lahann, 2009; George & Braun, 2009), nanowire-in-microtube structure (Chen et al., 2010), and to the combinations of core-shell and Janus nanostructures (K. J. Lee, Park, Hwang, Yoon, & Lahann, 2013). As the core-shell and Janus have been broadly reported in literature, and many excellent papers have reviewed the electrospun core-shell nanofibers (Han & Steckl, 2019; Lu et al., 2016; Pant, Park, & Park, 2019; Yoon, Yang, Lee, & Yu, 2018), thus, the focus of this work is mainly the complex structures with three or over three parts within the nanofibers. Correspondingly, the multifluid electrospinning is mainly about working processes that three or more than three different working fluids are simultaneously treated in the preparation.\nA simple summary about the appearances of different kinds of electrospinning processes are concluded in Table 1. In 1995, Doshi and Reneker published the first journal paper about polymeric nanofibers, which marked the reviving of electrospinning technology. Followed the reports about coaxial electrospraying (Loscertales et al., 2002), the double-fluid coaxial electrospinning was explored to create core-shell nanofibers in 2003 (Sun, Zussman, Yarin, Wendorff, & Greiner, 2003). And also at the same time of mid-2003, two publications reported the double-fluid side-by-side electrospinning for creating Janus nanostructures (Gupta & Wilkes, 2003; Madhugiri, Dalton, Gutierrez, Ferraris, & Balkus, 2003). As the understanding of electrospinning progresses, it was recognized that the most important thing for a successful electrospinning process was the formation of Taylor cone. This led to the needleless electrospinning, in which many Taylor cones could be formed from a free liquid surface to initiate a multiple-jet preparation process simultaneously (Yarin & Zussman, 2004). Meanwhile, the desire for creating nanofibers on a large-scale promoted the occurrence of multiple-jet electrospinning formed from many parallel spinnerets (Theron, Yarin, Zussman, & Kroll, 2005). Although the needleless and multiple-spinneret electrospinning can treat multiple bundles of working fluids at the same time, they are completely the same working solutions, and the resultant nanoproducts are essentially monolithic fibers (SalehHudin, Mohamad, Mahadi, & Muhammad Afifi, 2018). Thus, these processes are not included in the topic of the present review on multifluid electrospinning, which means the treatment of multiple different sorts of fluids at a single spinneret. The spinneret has a typical structural characteristic for guiding several fluids into the electrical fields for creating complex nanostructures.\nThe first paper about tri-fluid coaxial electrospinning was published in 2007 (Lallave et al., 2007), in which the outer fluid was pure ethanol to lubricate the working process and correspondingly the created products were core-shell fibers. It is also in this year, a brilliant concept that multiple channel structure could be generated using a special multifluid electrospinning process was demonstrated by Zhao, Cao, and Jiang (2007). The multifluid process was essentially a modified coaxial electrospinning, in which two kinds of fluids were organized in a core-shell manner. A shell TiO2 precursor fluid was explored to encapsulate three to five parallel inner fluids branched from a same core liquid of oil for creating the channels in the final products.\nIn 2009, different types of tri-layer microstructures from tri-fluid electrospinning were successively demonstrated. Kalra et al. (2009) firstly showed that tri-layer core-shell structures could be produced using the tri-fluid coaxial electrospinning, and three similar jobs were published about the creation of tri-layer Janus fibers (Bhaskar et al., 2009; Bhaskar & Lahann, 2009; George & Braun, 2009). However, all the three-layer Janus fibers had a similar size of around 10 μm. In 2010, Chen et al. organized two kinds of fluids into a tri-fluid coaxial process, in which the outer and inner fluids were TiO2 precursor solutions and the middle fluid was oil (Chen et al., 2010). Thus, a new complex structure, that is, nanowire-in-microtube, was firstly reported. In 2013, the concept about a combination of coaxial and side-by-side electrospinning was firstly demonstrated by K. J. Lee et al. (2013), in which a shell fluid was exploited to encapsulate dual core fluids. In 2014, the first publication about simultaneous treatment of four different kinds of fluids in a quad-axial manner was reported by Labbaf et al. (2014). Based on the combination of coaxial and side-by-side electrospinning, a tri-fluid coaxial with an acentric side-by-side fluids (Yu et al., 2017) and a side-by-side fluid with one side having the coaxial manner (Yu, Yang, Zhang, & Zhang, 2019) were firstly demonstrated for creating high quality Janus nanofibers and Janus fiber with a core-shell side, respectively."

      "text" : "The traditional monoaxial electrospinning cares mainly the electrospinnability of the solely working fluid for successful creation of polymeric nanofibers. In contrast, there are some other key elements for a successful multifluid electrospinning, which mainly exist in the applied apparatus (particularly the spinneret), the simultaneous treated working fluids, and the reasonable operational conditions as well."

      "heading" : "3.1 | The structured spinneret",
      "text" : "The spinneret is the most important part of an electrospinning system (Zhao et al., 2007). The electrospinning processes are often divided and termed through the structured spinnerets, such as concentric spinneret for coaxial processes (Q. Wang et al., 2017; C. Yang et al., 2016), side-by-side spinneret for side-by-side electrospinning (K. Wang, Liu, et al., 2018; K. Wang, Wen, et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2016), and tri-layer concentric spinneret for tri-axial electrospinning (Y. Y. Yang, Li, et al., 2019). Thus, for implementing a multifluid electrospinning, a reasonable spinneret having the desired complex structure characteristic for “duplicating” the similar complex nanostructures is necessary.\nSome special structured spinnerets are shown in Figure 2. A typical concentric tri-layer spinneret is given in Figure 2a. Although the spinneret was useful for conducting the tri-layer fluid coaxial electrospraying (Y. H. Lee et al., 2011), a similar technology of electrospinning in electrohydrodynamic atomization, there are two inevitable disadvantages. One is a heavy spinneret is not convenient for organization, and the other is the whole metal spinneret is easy to waste the high electrical energy to the surroundings. In contrast, a most recent investigation has optimized the design of tri-layer concentric spinneret (Figure 2b), in which a horn polypropylene (PP) tubing was explored to coat a traditional concentric spinneret to comprise a special tri-layer concentric spinneret. A small needle was utilized to penetrate the horn PP tubing to lead the outer working fluid in the spinneret as the outer working fluid (the upper-right inset of Figure 2b, Y. Y. Yang, Li, et al., 2019). For a better outer–middle–inner fluid envelope effect during tri-axial electrospinning, the three capillaries comprising the spinneret can be projected (Yu et al., 2015) or cut (B. S. Lee et al., 2014) slightly from each other.\nLahann's group developed a structured spinneret, in which two parallel capillaries were nested into a large capillary, shown in Figure 2c (K. J. Lee et al., 2013). Based on this spinneret, Janus microcylinders composed of different polymers were prepared through coaxial co-jetting with dual core fluids, followed by cross-linking, microsectioning, and shell removal. In electrospinning field, side-by-side electrospinning is always a big challenge. Although a concentric spinneret can be utilized for creating core-shell nanofibers, a side-by-side spinneret with two parallel capillaries (Figure 2d1) is hard to get the integrated Janus nanofibers due to mutual repulsion of fluids with same charge (Yu et al., 2016, 2017). In contrast, an acentric spinneret (Figure 2d2) and a structured spinneret (Figure 2d3) were reported to create Janus nanofibers with high quality (Yu et al., 2017). The failure of spinneret in Figure 2d1 and the success of spinnerets in Figure 2c, d2 and d3 can be explained by the diagrams in Figure 2e,f. A full and round charge distribution around the multiple fluids when they are pumped out from the spinneret's nozzle can benefit the matched behaviors of the multiple fluids to experience the whole working processes for creating integrated nanostructures. As for nonround charge distribution shown in Figure 2f, in which the two fluids have a very small point to contact each other, fluid divisions due to “the like electric charges repel” under the electrical field is very easy to happen, and in turn result in the failure of integrated Janus nanostructures (Yu et al., 2016)."

      "heading" : "3.2 | The compatibility between different working fluids",
      "text" : "For preparing a functional ingredient-loaded polymeric nanofiber using the monoaxial electrospinning, the compatibility between them is very important for forming monolithic nanocomposite (Lu, Wang, & Wei, 2009). The selected solvent or solvent mixture should meet the conditions that the polymer matrix has good enough electrospinnability and the functional ingredient has sufficient loading amount. As for multifluid electrospinning, all the components within a certain working fluid should have good compatibility. But the most important thing is that these working fluids should be compatible with each other (Yu et al., 2015).\nThe compatibility between different working fluids in the multifluid electrospinning processes can be evaluated in terms of three aspects. Firstly, none of the working fluids should generate the possibility of clogging the spinneret during the co-jetting processes (X. K. Liu et al., 2019). Secondly, there is no chemical reaction or physical coagulation between the contact fluids, and their interfacial forces should be as small as possible. Thirdly, there should be little diffusion of solute in one working fluid to another one.\nThe first one has a close relationship with the electrospinnability of the working fluid alone. The third one was demonstrated that the diffusion can be often overlooked between two parallel micro working fluid during a fast-drying process (Squires & Quake, 2005). Thus, the most important element in implementing a multifluid electrospinning is to reduce their interfacial tension during electrospinning. To solve this issue, some most recent typical examples are shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3a is a tri-fluid coaxial electrospinning, in which all the three fluids consisted of the same ethyl cellulose solutions but containing a gradient content of small molecule drug in them, eliminating totally the interfacial tensions (Yu et al., 2015). The up-right inset of Figure 3a shows a clear tri-layer compound Taylor cone, suggesting little diffusion by the red and blue markers. Figure 3b1 is a tri-layer droplet of three tri-layer fluids, an electrospinnable core fluid with an unspinnable middle fluid and an outer solvent, in which the diffusion phenomenon can be discerned (X. K. Liu et al., 2019). However, when three fluids were applied high voltage (Figure 3b2), the inner-middle and middle-outer boundaries are clear, suggesting little diffusion. Under the fine compatibility, the middle fluid flow rates can be easily manipulated for manipulating the thicknesses of the shell sections in the final nanofibers (Figure 3b3 and b4).\nIn a coaxial/side-by-side combination multifluid process (K. J. Lee et al., 2013), the three working fluids of poly(lactideco-glycolide), poly(vinyl cinnamate) and thermally cross-linkable epoxy resin were prepared using the totally same solvent mixture consisting of chloroform and dimethylforamide (95:5, vol/vol), effectively reducing the interfacial tensions and the possible coagulations. Figure 3d–f is a working processes of different side-by-side electrospinning, and their upper-right insets are their compound Taylor cones. The compatibility between the two side-by-side or acentric fluids could ensure a successive working process consisting of Taylor cone, straight fluid jet, and a bending and whipping unstable region (Figure 3d,e).\nHowever, a further additional co-shell solvent ethanol was demonstrated to be able to further stabilize the working processes (Figure 3f) and improve the final Janus nanofibers' quality (Yu et al., 2017)."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.3 | The special parameters for manipulating multifluid electrospinning",
      "text" : "Just as a routine single-fluid electrospinning, the multifluid process has the following parameters for manipulating the working processes, which can be categorized as four types: (a) about the working fluids' property: polymer molecular weight and its distribution, molecular branching or linear structure, solution properties such as concentration, viscosity, conductivity, surface tension, and the volatility of applied solvents; (b) about the operational parameters: flow rate, applied voltage, collecting distance, and the temperature of working fluid (Williams, Raimi-Abraham, & Luo, 2018); (c) about the apparatus: stability and accuracy of equipment, needle structure, nozzle diameter and shape, fluid introduction mode, collector form, and applied high voltage mode (Mirek, Korycka, Grzeczkowicz, & Lewi nska, 2019); and (d) about the environmental conditions: temperature, humidity, vacuum state, indoor air flow speed, heating and so on.\nHowever, compared with the traditional electrospinning, there are unique characteristics for manipulating the multifluid electrospinning process. The first one is that there should be a key fluid among the different working liquids, which should be electrospinable and should act as a leading role during the whole process. Other fluids can be electreospinnable or unspinnable. They need to follow and match the behaviors of the main fluid under the electrical fields. For example, core-shell nanofibers with blank coating were prepared using tri-axial electrospinning, in which two unspinnable liquids (outer and middle) followed well with the inner spinnable core fluid (X. K. Liu et al., 2019; Y. Y. Yang, Li, et al., 2019).\nThe second is the addition of two important parameters, that is, the total real flow rate of all the working fluids pumped out from the nozzle of spinneret and the rate ratios among them. The former should match the applied voltage well for effectively drying the working fluid and meanwhile preventing the dripping droplet phenomena during the working processes. The latter should keep the leading fluid as a control role, which often have a larger flow rate than others. For example, in the preparation of core-shell structure with Janus core, the flow rate of the shell fluid was always 2.5 to 5 larger than the sum of double core fluid for better encapsulation (K. J. Lee et al., 2013).\nThe third is how to correlate the working process with the final products' quality. For the traditional single-fluid process, numerous publications have reported the influences of all the variables that can exert their influences on the process and final nanofibers' quality. However, the results are not satisfactory because that there are too many parameters to interact with each\nother (Zhou et al., 2019). As for the multifluid processes, the situation is further complicated by the influences of each other (Jiang, Duan, Zussman, Greiner, & Agarwal, 2014). However, no matter how many fluids being treated simultaneously, the formation of Taylor cone is always the most important phenomenon and there should be only one compound Taylor core, only one straight fluid jet and a sole unstable region (M. L. Wang et al., 2019). Thus, the parameters reflecting these process characteristics should be explored as a powerful tool kit for adjusting the multifluid electrospinning and the quality of final nanofibers, just as the single-fluid electrospinning (Y. Y. Yang, Zhu, et al., 2019) or electrospraying (Huang et al., 2019)."

      "heading" : "4 | DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF THE COMPLEX STRUCTURES",
      "text" : "The double-layer core-shell and Janus structures have been broadly explored for creating a wide variety of functional nanomaterials. In comparison, very limited publications can be found on the functional applications of multilayer complex nanostructures. They are difficult to be created either through “top-down” or through “bottom-up” methods. Correspondingly, the complex structures prepared from multifluid electrospinning are similarly at their infant stage. Most of the related publications mainly reported the preparation processes and how to optimize the experimental parameters (X. K. Liu et al., 2019). Only very simple functional applications are endowed to these complex structures.\nAccording to the conceiving strategies, the electrospun complex structures can be further divided into three categories. Firstly, the multiple-layer structures consisting of different components, which are generated directly from the multifluid electrospinning. For example, tri-layer core-shell structures are formed directly from the tri-fluid coaxial electrospinning in Figure 4a (Kalra et al., 2009) and Figure 4b (W. Liu et al., 2013), and quad-layer core-shell structure are generated directly from quad-axial in Figure 4c (Labbaf et al., 2014). McClure et al. reported an electrospun tri-layer conduit composed of poly\n(ε-caprolactone), elastin and collagen with different ratios for different layers, which held promise for vascular graft application (Garg & Bowlin, 2011; McClure, Sell, Simpson, Walpoth, & Bowlin, 2010).\nSecondly, special after-treatments are applied to the products generated from the multifluid electrospinning, for example, removal of a certain layer to get the desired Janus structure in Figure 4d (K. J. Lee et al., 2013), or calcination of the multilayer fibers to achieve the unique inner channels and promote the material transformation in Figure 4e–h (Zhao & Jiang, 2009; Zhao et al., 2007).\nThirdly, there should be many routes for functionalizing these complex multiple-layer nanostructures based on the combination of different sorts of polymeric matrices and through intentionally tailoring the components, compositions, and spatial distributions within each layer. For example, tri-layer nanofibers (Figure 4i, a TEM image) with the components spatial organization within the fibers (Figure 4j) was designed to have an intermediate barrier allowing a controlled release function. The hygroscopic sheath layer consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidone and drug could give an initial burst release. The hydrophobic intermediate sheath layer composed of polycaprolactone between the inner core and outer sheath could act as a barrier to prevent leaching from the core. The inner medicated layer as a drug depot was able to provide a drug sustained release profile. The whole complex structure could give a dual drug delivery with each having its own drug controlled release profile (Han & Steckl, 2013).\nShown in Figure 4k is a transmission electron microscopic (TEM) image of a tri-layer core-shell nanofiber, in which the drug had a gradient distribution (Yu et al., 2015). Figure 4l is a schematic illustration about the action mechanism for providing a zero-order linear drug release profile. As the diffusion distance of drug gradually increased from inner layer (Ri) to middle layer (Rm) and to outer layer (Ro), the gradual increase of drug contents could counteract the negative effects for providing a sustained release."

      "heading" : "5 | CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES",
      "text" : "The multifluid electrospinning is still in its infancy stage comparing with the single-fluid electrospinning and double-fluid coaxial electrospinning. The structured spinneret, the compatibility among the working fluids, and the special parameters are key elements for implementing a successful multifluid electrospinning process. Complex nanostructures can be created using the multifluid processes through different strategies such as direct electrospinning, after-treatment of the electrospun nanoproducts, and elaborate tailoring the components, compositions and their spatial distributions within the nanofibers. These complex structures should provide a platform for developing new kinds of multiple function nanomaterials.\nTo advance multifluid electrospinning research, more attention should be paid on the following aspects. Firstly, design of more kinds of multifluid electrospinning methods based on the organizations of three or more different sorts of working fluids. The conceptual thinking has to be broadened from that of only two kinds of double fluid electrospinning, that is, coaxial and side-by-side electrospinning. Based on the developments of structured spinneret, new multifluid electrospinning processes are still waited to be disclosed.\nSecondly, because it is not a prerequisite that all the working fluids must be electrospinnable in a multifluid process, the inclusion of one or even two unspinnable working fluids would greatly expanding the capability of electrospinning in forming new structured nanofibers for taking advantages of the unique property of non-woven nanofiber mats.\nThirdly, new insights and mechanisms about the multifluid electrospinning are still waited to be disclosed, particularly the behaviors of multiple fluids under the electrical fields, their matching behaviors and the simultaneous property.\nFinally, how to take advantage of the electrospun complex nanostructures for functional applications is still a big challenge. These complex nanostructures, on one hand, can be a strong platform for directly designing and developing multifunctional nanomaterials, just as the fundamental core-shell nanostructure that has supported thousands of investigations about functional applications. On the other hand, they can be excellent templates for further creating complex nanostructures of creamic and other inorganic nanofibers, for producing nanotubes and for manipulating self-assembly of molecular building blocks within the confined region of nanofibers' diameter."

The need of complex nanostructure-based advanced functional nanomaterials has promoted the appearance of several kinds of multifluid electrospinning processes, such as triaxial electrospinning, quad-fluid coaxial electrospinning, tri-fluid side-by-side electrospinning, and coaxial electrospinning with a side-by-side core. These multifluid processes can greatly expand the capability of electrospinning in generating new types of nanostructures with different organization manner of the inner parts, and from both spinnable and unspinnable working fluids. The key elements for conducting a multifluid electrospinning lie in a well-designed spinneret, compatibility of the working fluids, and special operational parameters. The complex nanostructures can be created through direct electrospinning of multiple fluids, through after-treatment of the electrospun products, and through ingenious design of the components, compositions and their spatial distributions as well. This article provides a simple review on the most recent publications about the multifluid electrospinning processes and the corresponding complex nanostructures.",
