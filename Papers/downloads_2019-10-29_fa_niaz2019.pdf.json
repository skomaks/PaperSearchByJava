In this study, rhamnosomes (RS) were developed by engineering the membrane of nano-liposomes with antimicrobial surfactant i.e. rhamnolipids (RL). Intrinsically active rhamnosome nano-vesicles (RSNVs) were loaded with bacteriocin (nisin Z) to acquire broadspectrum antimicrobial activity. Addition of rhamnolipids into the lipid bilayer exhibited an increase in the encapsulation efficiency of nisin from 47 ± 4% to 88 ± 7%. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Zetasizer revealed that the surface functionalization with RL increased the size of vesicles from 145 ± 2 nm to 209 ± 4 nm. Whereas, the zeta potential of nisin-loaded RSNVs was −20 ± 0.25mV as compared to −3.47 ± 0.13mV for loaded nano-liposomes, indicating higher physical stability of RSNVs. RSNVs not only demonstrated higher antimicrobial activity than liposomes but also enhanced the activity of nisin against Grampositive and Gram-negative resistant foodborne pathogens including L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Almost 80% reduction in biofilm biomass was observed when treated with nisin-loaded RSNVs due to its improved binding with bacterial surface. Thus, surface-active nanoliposomes (intrinsically active) with higher stability can provide an innovative strategy to control the biofilm-forming food associated pathogens."

      "text" : "Global burden of deaths due to foodborne pathogens and food spoilage is reaching epidemic level. The worldwide incidence of foodborne diseases is alarming with 600 million cases reported each year, which contribute for 420,000 deaths annually (Fung, Wang, & Menon, 2018; Organization, 2015), while 30–50% of the food supply is wasted due to spoilage pathogens (Eleftheriadou, Pyrgiotakis, & Demokritou, 2017). Food industry is exploring novel strategies to develop effective natural antimicrobials to improve food safety and extend product shelf life (Irorere, Tripathi, Marchant, McClean, & Banat, 2017; Tai et al., 2017). Among natural antimicrobial food preservatives, bacteriocins e.g. nisin are used to protect the food from microbial growth during processing and storage. Nisin has been used in food bio-preservation since 1950, it inhibits cell wall synthesis and forms pores in the cell membrane of bacteria by binding to the precursor of peptidoglycan i.e. lipid II. Generally, Gram-positive bacteria are very sensitive to nisin, including lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Listeria, Mycobacterium, Staphylococcus spp. and also spore-forming bacteria such as Clostridium and\nBacillus (Johnson et al., 2017). The effectiveness of free nisin in the food systems is mostly affected by the interaction and complex formation with food components. Various factors including salt concentration, pH of the food matrix, divalent ions, glutathione, and proteolytic enzymes present in the food system (Khan & Oh, 2016) disturb the permeability, solubility and distribution of bacteriocin in the food matrix (Hugo & Hugo, 2015). Furthermore, recent reports have verified that the strains of L. monocytogenes and S. aureus are becoming resistant to the free form of nisin (Ceotto-Vigoder et al., 2016; Lather, Mohanty, Jha, Garsa, & Sood, 2015). Structural change in gadD2 gene and ABC transporter required for the function of virulence factor (VirR) in Listeria monocytogenes (Grubaugh et al., 2018a; Szendy et al., 2019) and activation of an intrinsic peptide antibiotic detoxification module (Randall et al., 2018) in S. aureus are involved in the development of nisin resistance.\nTo overcome these limitations, nano-scale innovative approaches can be applied to control bacterial food spoilage. Utilization of biobased, non-toxic, biocompatible materials in the form of nano delivery systems (NDS) with either intrinsic or extrinsic (encapsulated agents)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.108583 Received 12 April 2019; Received in revised form 2 August 2019; Accepted 30 August 2019\n∗ Corresponding author.

Among nano-vesicles, liposomes are widely used food-grade carrier systems to increase the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble compounds (M. Imran, A.-M. Revol-Junelles, G. Francius, & S. Desobry, 2016a; Imran et al., 2015). Use of natural lecithin (e.g. soy-lecithin) in the production of liposomes does not raise any food legislation concerns and provides nutritional value due to high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content.\nHowever, high percentage of PUFA makes liposomes more permeable and less stable (Greninger et al., 2016). Moreover owing to high sensitivity of liposomes to environmental conditions (temperature, pH, ionic strength), liposomal fusion can occur, which leads to burst release of encapsulated agents. Polymer coated liposomes can improve the thermal, fusogenic, physicochemical and controlled release properties of liposomes (Han, Sherman, Filocamo, & Steckl, 2017; Raval, Rangnekar, & Raval, 2017).\nPotential of glycolipids based antimicrobial surfactants for the functionalization of liposomes has not been explored yet for food-safety applications. Bio-surfactants e.g. rhamnolipids (RLs) are surface-active biomolecules produced mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Hannon, Kerry, Cruz-Romero, Morris, & Cummins, 2015) and are composed of rhamnose moiety and lipid part. RLs are characterized by unique antimicrobial and physiochemical properties including surface activity, membrane permeability and amphipathic nature. The presence of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties allows rhamnolipids to change cell surface polarity, and thus affect the biofilm architecture.\nPreviously, topological changes in liposomes were studied that are induced upon interactions with cationic, anionic and oligomeric surfactants and their effect on both the disintegration and solubilization of liposomes was evaluated (Y. He & Chen, 2010). Recent reports assessed the thermodynamics of liposome-surfactant interactions while understanding the effect of physiochemical interaction of surfactants with liposomes and their skin penetration ability (Han et al., 2017; Hassan Baig et al., 2016). The purpose of our study was to develop stabilized nano-liposomes having intrinsic antimicrobial activity and to enhance nisin spectrum against Gram negative foodborne pathogens.\nTo our knowledge, there is no report to elucidate the influence of RLs on liposomal properties including intrinsic antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential. The present study was aimed to characterize the rhamnolipids functionalized liposomes (rhamnosomes) and its utilization as vehicles for the delivery and controlled release of bacteriocin against foodborne pathogens."

      "text" : "3.1. Resistance and susceptibility profiling of foodborne pathogens\nTo assess multidrug resistance in pathogens, disc diffusion method on the Muller-Hinton agar was performed. All four bacteria were tested against 14 different commercially available antibiotic discs. Zone of inhibition of each antibiotic was measured (Fig. S1, supplementary data). Breakpoints used to determine susceptible, intermediate, and resistant categories and comparison of CLSI breakpoints (Table SI, supplementary data) applicable to antibiotics relevant to L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are given in Table 1. All Gram negative and positive strains used in this study were resistant to penicillin derivatives and penicillin group of β-lactam antibiotics e.g. ampicillin (AMP), Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC) and methicillin (MET) and aztreonam (ATM) belonging to monobactams class of β-lactams, which might be due to horizontal transfer of resistance genes present on the plasmid of these pathogens (Holmes et al., 2016). However, except S. aureus, all other bacteria were sensitive towards broad spectrum first generation carbapenems e.g. imipenem (IMP). Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to third generation cephalosporins e.g. cephalothin (KF), ceftriaxone (CRO) and vancomycin (VA), which mark it as vancomycin resistant strain (VRSA). In addition, S. aureus was also resistant to methicillin, hence considered as\nmethicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Emergence of β-lactam resistance in Gram negative pathogens like E. coli and opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa could be due to a chromosomally encoded β-lactamase called AmpC (Fumeaux & Bernhardt, 2017). L. monocytogenes acquire resistant to multiple antibiotics through transferable plasmid-mediated resistance (Escolar, Gómez, del Carmen Rota García, Conchello, & Herrera, 2017; Honary & Zahir, 2013). This multiplicity of resistance mechanisms poses a significant therapeutic challenge as even relatively new antibiotics are unable to provide therapeutic coverage against infections caused by such pathogens. Effectiveness of traditional antibiotics based combinational therapy may possibly fail in future by large repertoire of mutations causing resistance in pathogens."

      "text" : "The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the nisin, RLs and nisin loaded nano vesicles (NVs) against different Gram positive and Gram-negative pathogens are summarized in Table 2. Nisin demonstrated potent activity against Gram-positive pathogens with MICs of 25 μg/mL and 5 μg/mL for L. monocytogenes and S. aureus respectively. Previously reported MIC of nisin against sensitive strains of L. monocytogenes is 3–6 μg/mL (Carniello, Harapanahalli, Busscher, & van der Mei, 2018; Grubaugh et al., 2018b; Ibarra-Sánchez, Van Tassell, & Miller, 2018). However, in our study resistant strain of Listeria was tested, which resulted in higher MIC of nisin. Whereas, against Gramnegative pathogens e.g. E.coli, nisin demonstrated inhibitory activity at very high concentration of 1000 μg/mL and showed no activity against P. aeruginosa. Similar results were obtained by Biswaro, Sousa, Rezende, Dias, & Franco, 2018, where nisin demonstrated inhibition activity against Gram negative pathogens when used in combination with antibiotics (Biswaro et al., 2018). This inactivity of nisin is due to outer membrane present in the Gram-negative pathogens, which prevent the peptide to reach the periplasm and to bind with lipid II in the inner membrane (He et al., 2016).\nRhamnolipids demonstrate MICs of 1000, 10, 50 and 5 μg/mL against L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and E. coli and P. aeruginosa respectively. These results suggest that all foodborne pathogens used in this study were sensitive to rhamnolipids at very low concentration except L. monocytogenes. Previously Nitschke., 2018 (Nitschke & Silva,\n2018) reported MIC of rhamnolipids' against L. monocytogenes was 2500 μg/mL. However, RLs demonstrated bacteriostatic activity at lower concentration e.g. 78 μg/mL and may produce bactericidal activity in synergism with nisin at this low concentration."

      "text" : "Particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index (PDI), encapsulation efficiency (EE %) and DL capacity of various nano formulations are presented in Table 3.\nIn order to deduce the hydrodynamic radius (RH) of the NVs, dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique was used. Void and loaded Liposomal nano-vesicles exhibited a mean diameter of 145 ± 2 nm and 161 ± 2 nm, respectively. However, incorporation of RLs in the membrane of liposomes nano vesicles (LNVs) increased the particle size to 209 ± 4 nm which increased further to 292 ± 2 nm after encapsulation of nisin. Many researchers studied on polysaccharide stabilized LNVs and observed increase in particle size after coating and encapsulation (Lopes, Pinilla, & Brandelli, 2019; Niaz et al., 2018; Trapani et al., 2018). In our data PDI values were found to be almost 0.2 and 0.3 in both non-functionalized and RLs functionalized liposomes (RSNVs) respectively, which indicate the presence of monodispersed and more stable nano-vesicles (Fu, Sarkar, Bhunia, & Yao, 2016).\nZeta potential at the characteristic slipping plane of electrophoretically mobile functionalized and non-functionalized nano vesicles was also analysed, which is another important parameter to determine the stability of nano-formulations. Zeta potential values above +30 mV or below −30 mV generally indicate good dispersion stability by preventing aggregation and fusion of the LNVs (Furuya et al., 2017; Gang et al., 2012). Phospholipid composition predominantly influenced surface charge of LNVs because of the anionic nature of group linked to phosphate moiety. Liposomal vesicles had a ζ-potential of −4.7 ± 0.16mV at 25 °C (Table 2). Ζ-potential of RSNVs was −35.5 ± 0.20mV, which is higher because of the addition of anionic surfactant RLs.\nChemical structure, composition, size and charge on nano structure as well as on active agent are the main factors affecting encapsulation efficiency of nano-vesicles (NVs). Nisin is a cationic amphiphilic peptide containing a cluster of hydrophobic residues at the N-terminus and hydrophilic residues at the C-terminus, so it can encapsulate simultaneously in the core as well as in the bilayers of LNVs (Imran, RevolJunelles, Francius, & Desobry, 2016b).\nIncrease in the size would increase the encapsulation efficiency (EE %), and vice versa. EE% and drug loading capacity (DLC) of rhamnosomes was noticeably higher than liposomes. With RSNVs, 88% encapsulation efficiency of nisin was achieved which is almost double than liposomes (47%). This could be due to the increase in size of liposome nanovesicle after functionalization with rhamnolipids (145 nm–209 nm). Additionally, nisin contains terminal amino group of isoleucine and terminal carboxyl group of lysine, ionization of this carboxyl group occurs at pH below 6.5, which increase its solubility in water. At basic pH, structural modifications (intra molecular\ninteractions) and de-protonation of terminal amino groups of nisin reduce its positive charge and make nisin less available for interaction with other molecules. As a result, reduction in electrostatic interaction between nisin and oppositely charge liposomes was observed (Gharsallaoui, Joly, Oulahal, & Degraeve, 2016). Thus, non-functionalized LNVs result in reduced EE % and antimicrobial efficiency of nisin. As the pKa values of RLs ranges from 5.6 to 5.9 (Rodrigues, Gudiña, Teixeira, & Rodrigues, 2017) which is in the solubility range of nisin, which results in better interaction of nisin with rhamnolipids moieties in the RSNVs, thus increasing its encapsulation efficiency.\nAnother reason behind increased EE% of nisin in RSNVs could be the anionic character of rhamnolipids. Carboxylate group present in rhamnolipids increased the negative charge in phospholipids bilayer structure of LNVs, thus promoting the binding of cationic nisin (Fernández-Gutiérrez et al., 2016; Fleige, Quadir, & Haag, 2012). Hence, higher DLC and EE values were achieved with the addition of the RLs, enabling the RSNVs to entrap additional amounts of nisin.\nSimilarly loading capacity of the RSNVs was (45.2 ± 1.6) higher than that of the LNVs (31.4 ± 2). As it was previously stated that surfactant molecules with high hydrophobicity are easier to embed into the phospholipid bilayers through steric fitting and hydrophobic interactions (Tan, Feng, Zhang, Xia, & Xia, 2016), thus result in imperfect longitudinal stuffing inside the membranes. Such stuffing of RLs moieties in the lipid bilayer of LNVs provided more space for nisin molecules (Tai et al., 2017). In addition, surfactants embedding into bilayers of liposomes increased the overall mass of the NVs, which resulted in higher entrapment of active agents. These results coincide with the previous studies where intercalation of surfactants and proteins in phospholipid bilayer of liposomes increased the EE and LC of active agents (Hong et al., 2018; Lopes, Pinilla, & Brandelli, 2019; Tai et al., 2017).\nThe amount of encapsulated substance in LNVs is dependent on the capacity of bilayers to accommodate it and on its concentration in the internal aqueous phase of the vesicles. The increased entrapment capacity of RSNVs may indicate that part of the encapsulated nisin is inserted or immobilized on the surface of NVs membrane as well, suggesting that the lipid membrane area available per unit mass for nisin Z increased after RLs addition in phospholipid membrane, that may serve to increase the lipid membrane available for nisin adsorption, which resulted in bigger size and higher entrapment efficiency of RSNVs (Laridi et al., 2003)."

      "text" : "The morphological characterization was carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to know the structure, shape and size of the NVs. SEM image (Fig. 1) illustrates that liposomes are spherical and have a smooth surface. Size analysis performed on SEM images confirmed liposome (with or without nisin) with mean diameters below 50 nm. Furthermore, it was also observed that nisin incorporation in LNVs did not affect their morphology as it is demonstrated in Fig. 1-II. Apparently, the morphology of nano-vesicles changed after the addition of rhamnolipid (Fig. 1-III), rough surface morphology was observed which might be because of incorporation of monomers of rhamnolipids in phospholipids double layer of rhamnosomes, giving rhamnosomes\nrough appearance. These results are in accordance with the previous studies where coating with polymers usually change the morphology of nano vesicles (NVs) from smooth surfaced ones to slightly irregularly and rough spherical shaped ones (Hao et al., 2017; Li, Hwang, Chen, & Park, 2016).\nSimilarly, nisin loaded rhamnosomes nano vesicles (N-RSNVs) demonstrated irregular shape with rough surface morphology (Fig. 1-IV), which confirms that the inclusion of nisin in rhamnosomes did not modify the shape and morphology of the produced nano-vesicles. Thus we can conclude that more nisin is encapsulated inside the nano-systems rather than to attach or adsorbed onto the surface of NVs.\nSize of LNVs and RSNVs observed under SEM was different from the values obtained from DLS. This phenomenon might be attributed to the characteristic difference in detection method of the particle size between DLS and SEM. The DLS determined the size of nanoparticles in the aqueous solution, whereas SEM measured the size of the nanoparticles from the images of dried sample (Dai et al., 2018)."

FTIR spectra of soylecithin (SL) phospholipids (Fig. 2-I) revealed NH or CH3, CH2 in alkyl chain, C]C stretching vibrations at 3439, 2933 and 2031 cm−1, respectively. Characteristic bands of C]O, symmetric and asymmetric PO2 and (CH3)3 N appeared at 1735, 1515 and 898 cm−1, respectively. Asymmetric vibration of PO2 group was very sensitive to the hydration state of bilayer as evident from the appearance of a deep peak appearing at 1635 cm−1 in void liposomes (Fig. 2-II). This shift of asymmetric spectra of broad PO2 stretch (1735, 1515 cm−1) occurred because of hydrogen bonding between water molecules and PO2 groups of phospholipids, which was an indication of lipid bilayer vesicle formation. In the FTIR spectra of void liposomes, a broad and deep band appeared at 3429 cm−1 representing O–H group from COOH. This band broadening also indicates the interaction between O–H groups of phospholipids and the surrounding water to form NVs (Niaz et al., 2018).\nSimilarly, in the FTIR spectrum of RLs, major characteristic bands appeared at 3423, 2924, 2859, 1731 and 1586 cm−1; these peaks represent the bending of OH, CH2, CH3, C–H and COO− cm−1, respectively. Another characteristic peak of RLs was found at around 1057 cm−1corresponding to the C–O stretching vibration because of the ether bonds. However, in the spectral analysis of RSNVs, two major transmission peaks were appeared at 3416 and 1637 cm−1. First broad and deep peak is the indication of week electrostatic interaction of predominantly hydrogen bonding between OH group of RLs and N terminal group in phosphide (Irorere et al., 2017), second sharp peak at 1637 cm−1 is owing to possible interaction between PO2 group of SL and C–H group in RL. Moreover, all FTIR transmission peaks present in liposomes (Fig. 2-II) are present in RLs functionalized liposomal nanovesicles, which confirms that RLs did not disturb the vesicular structure of liposomes. However, slight change in PO2 and O–H stretching peaks observed in RSNVS from 3429 to 3416 cm−1 and from 1635 to 1637 cm−1 were notable and confirms the incorporation of RLs between the phospholipids and stabilize the vesicular structure. These\nresults are in accordance with previous studies where shift in the FTIR spectra of nano-systems observed after stabilizing nanoliposomes with RLs (Wei et al., 2019). Similar result has been published recently (Bnyan et al., 2018), where author observed that incorporation of surfactant monomers in nanoliposomes, reduces vesicle aggregation and enhance stability of the nano delivery systems. Another study suggested that single chain surfactant act as edge activators and improve membrane stability by incorporating at the edges of liposomal membrane (Hua, 2015). From this data, we can conclude that rhamnolipid will orient itself between the molecules of phospholipid and make vesicular structure of liposomes more stable.\nIn FTIR spectral analysis of nisin powder, O–H stretch of COOH groups, symmetrical stretch of C–H group and bending of primary amines were observed at 3301 cm−1, 3046 cm−1 and 1517 cm−1 which is in accordance with the previous data (Abd-El-Azim, Ramadan, Nafee, & Khalafallah, 2017; Chopra, Kaur, Bernela, & Thakur, 2014). All these characteristics of bacteriocin are absent in the FTIR spectrum of nisin loaded RSNVs (Fig. 2-II).\nHowever, after nisin encapsulation in RSNVs, slight increase in all the major characteristic peaks of nano-vesicles was observed e.g. 3416–3456 cm−1 and 1673 to 1638 cm−1, which could be due to interactions between nisin and nano-vesicle as encapsulation slightly disturbed the orientations of bonds and resulted in compact arrangements of alkyl chains (Alavi, Karimi, & Safaei, 2017). FTIR results suggested that hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effects and electrostatic\nattraction contributed to the formation of RSNVs. Similarly week electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions are responsible for the entrapment of nisin in fabricated NVs as no covalent bonding was observed in N-RSNVs."

      "heading" : "3.6. In-vitro antibacterial activity: survival curve",
      "text" : "The survival curve depicted the effect of free form of nisin, rhamnolipids, void and nisin loaded nano-liposomes and rhamnosomes at MIC concentration against the growth of four foodborne pathogens (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) e.g. Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nIn survival curve of Listeria monocytogenes (Fig. 3-I), it was observed that both rhamnolipids solution and void rhamnosomes (RS) nano-vesicles (NVs) controlled the bacterial growth almost similarly for first 12 h. Afterwards, an increase in the bacterial growth was observed in the presence of rhamnolipids solution only. However, it could be observed in Fig. 3-I that void liposomes did not demonstrate any effect against Listeria monocytogenes. Free nisin initially reduced Listeria monocytogenes growth almost double than rhamnolipids solution and void RSNVs but after 12 h constant increase in bacterial growth was observed till 44 h, which can be attributed to less active and bacteriostatic nature of nisin in its free form (Blair, Webber, Baylay, Ogbolu, & Piddock, 2015). Nisin loaded liposomes controlled the bacterial growth more efficiently than free nisin. But bacteriocin loaded RSNVs totally\ninhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes till 56 h because of dual antimicrobial activity of RSNVs as well as encapsulated nisin. Thus, encapsulation of nisin in rhamnosomes efficiently improved its antimicrobial activity than its free form which showed bacteriostatic effect till 24 h only. Previously, it was observed that L. monocytogenes cells in presence of surfactant e.g. rhamnolipids were more sensitive towards nisin. As rhamnolipids alter the cell surface properties (Bortolaia, Espinosa-Gongora, & Guardabassi, 2016) by changing the number of anionic lipids in the membrane.\nSimilarly, free nisin reduced the growth of Staphylococcus aureus (Fig. 3-II) to almost half as compared to control positive because of well-known bacteriolytic activity of nisin (Brandelli, Brum, & dos Santos, 2016; Brotfain et al., 2016). Rhamnolipids controlled the growth of S. aureus better than free nisin which was corresponding to\nthe lower MIC value of rhamnolipids (2 μg/mL) than nisin (5 μg/mL) against S. aureus. Void rhamnosomes reduced the bacterial growth more efficiently than nisin loaded liposomes (N-liposomes) and free nisin. Moreover, nisin loaded RSNVs (N-RSNVs) remarkably controlled the growth of S. aureus till 56 h because of synergistic effect of rhamnolipids and nisin. Anionic phospholipids in the presence of bio-surfactant could facilitate electrostatic interactions with bacterial cell membranes, thus enhancing membrane susceptibility to encapsulated cationic peptides (Caetano, Almeida, & Gonçalves, 2016; Y.; Chen, Qiao, Fan, Han, & Wang, 2017), thus resulting in better antimicrobial activity against bacterial pathogens. Moreover controlled release of nisin from rhamnosomes did not allow pathogen to grow over longer period of time. These results suggested that the encapsulation in RSNVs effectively sustained the release of nisin for at least 56 h, providing an\neffective way to control L. monocytogenes growth in In-vitro assays. The survival curves in Fig. 3 (III, IV) displayed the effect of the various nano formulations on the growth of Gram-negative pathogen e.g. E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The survival curve of both pathogens demonstrated that the free nisin was unable to control the bacterial growth. Nisin uses lipid II as a docking molecule to form pores in bacterial membrane, which ultimately leads to the bacterial cell lysis and death (Wilmes & Sahl, 2017). However, this lipid II is present in inner membrane of Gram-negative pathogens. In these pathogens, the outer lipopolysaccharide membrane (OM) shields the cytoplasmic membrane (inner membrane), thus preventing nisin to act against E. coli and P. aeruginosa effectively.\nRhamnolipids controlled the growth of Gram-negative pathogens twofold than free or encapsulated nisin. Previously, it was observed that rhamnolipids change the cell surface polarity, zeta potential and cell membrane hydrophobicity in Gram-negative pathogens e.g. P. aeruginosa (C.-Y. Chen, Nace, & Irwin, 2003; J. Cheng et al., 2007). Hence, adsorption of rhamnolipids (RL) on bacterial cell membrane at lower concentration (below critical micelle concentration) reduce cell surface hydrophobicity by releasing LPS (lipopolysaccharides), protein and other polysaccharides from cell surface of Gram-negative pathogens (L. Cheng, Bulmer, & Margaritis, 2015). This may increase the permeability\nof outer membrane, which leads to bacterial cell lysis. Void RSNVs controlled the growth of Gram-negative pathogens more efficiently than free rhamnolipids (RLs), which could be attributed towards the low surface tension of rhamnolipids at nano-scale (R. Cheng, Meng, Deng, Klok, & Zhong, 2013). Moreover, in free-form, bio-surfactants form large micelles which reduces their adsorption on cell surface. Thus, after liposomes functionalization with the monomers of rhamnolipids, RLs were incorporated between/within the phospholipid bilayer resulting in increased adsorption of vesicle on bacterial cell surface. As the antimicrobial and adsorption effects of rhamnosomes are more seffective than the micelle adsorption, it had demonstrated better activity against selected Gram-negative strains than the free RLs (Corazzari et al., 2015; Corcione & Frigione, 2012). It was observed that nisin loaded rhamnosomes nano-vesicles (N-RSNVs) efficiently controlled the growth of E.coli and P. aeruginosa because of increased permeability through outer-membrane. Thus, RSNVs enabled the encapsulated nisin to pass protectively through outer membrane barrier of Gram-negative bacteria, so that nisin could reach the cytoplasmic membrane and performed its bacterial membrane lysis function.\nA recent study showed that antimicrobial activity of encapsulated nisin was higher when anionic nano delivery systems were used to encapsulate it, due to a decrease in the electrostatic repulsion induced\nby divalent cations associated with bacterial cell walls (Zimet et al., 2018). Consequently, it is plausible that the negatively charged RSNVs prepared in this study may also had a positive effect on the antimicrobial activity of encapsulated nisin as, kmcompared to free nisin (cationic). Thus, it can be concluded that functionalization of liposomes with rhamnolipids not only produce intrinsic antimicrobial potential in liposomes but increase the activity of rhamnolipids and nisin against\nboth Gram-positive and Gram-negative foodborne pathogens.\n3.7. Antibiofilm activity of antimicrobial nano-vesicles\n3.7.1. Preventive antibiofilm assay Preventive biofilm inhibition effect of nisin, rhamnolipids and their nano-formulations were tested after 48 h of incubation with bacterial\npathogens (Fig. 4-I). It was observed that rhamnolipids solution inhibited almost 50% of biofilm biomass formed by foodborne pathogens. Though, nisin did not considerably controlled the biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa and E. coli, because of its ineffectiveness against Gramnegative pathogens (H. Chen & Zhong, 2017). Void liposomes demonstrated negligible biofilm inhibition activity against all pathogens. Interestingly nisin loaded rhamnosomes achieved more than 80% reduction in the biofilm biomass even against Gram-negative pathogens. For nisin loaded RSNVs, reductions in the biofilm biomass of Gramnegative and Gram-negative pathogens were almost equal.\nThis might be due to combined effect of RLs and antibacterial agent i.e. nisin in RSNVs to decrease overall biofilm biomass. RLs in nanoliposomes would alter the physicochemical properties of the surface, hence restraining bacterial cell to attach on polystyrene surface and form biofilm (Díaz De Rienzo, Stevenson, Marchant, & Banat, 2016). This difference clearly demonstrates that the RLs functionalized NVs exhibited 2-folds greater anti-biofilm effect than free nisin and nisin loaded liposomes. However, this effect was more pronounced against the biofilms of Gram-positive pathogens than those of Gram-negative i.e. P. aeruginosa.\n3.7.2. Pre-formed biofilm reduction activity Biomass inhibition was determined by crystal violet assay and the representative biofilm images (magnification, 10× 100) of all selected bacterial strain treated with nano formulations were also assessed (Fig. 5). Untreated biofilms were considered as control positive. Light microscopy image analysis showed high surface colonization in the control P. aeruginosa and the treatment with RSNVs extensively disintegrates 48-h old biofilm formed on microscopic cover glass (Fig. 5C). Similar observations are made with the biofilms formed with E. coli, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes. Our results revealed that free nisin did not significantly diminish the pre-formed biofilms of all four pathogens because of more complex and barrier properties of the extracellular\nbiofilm matrix which did not allow free antimicrobial peptide to penetrate inside the biofilm matrix (Benmansour et al., 2016; Bernela, Kaur, Chopra, & Thakur, 2014) Active liposomes also notably eradicate S. aureus and L. monocytogenes (Fig. 5A and D) biofilms.\nIn term of biomass inhibition, more than 50% of reduction in S. aureus and L. monocytogenes biofilms was observed (Fig. 4-II), which could be due to small surface area of liposomes thus enabling nisin to penetrate inside the biofilm matrix in concentrated form and promote cell lysis. Nisin loaded RSNVs effectively reduced biofilms formed by L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa up to 84, 88, 83 and 86%, respectively, which is in accordance with previous results were contents of P. aeruginosa biofilms were reduced by 79.6% (Kim, Jung, Yu, Chae, & Kim, 2015; Nitschke & Silva, 2018). Rhamnolipids could act directly on the biofilm matrix to disrupt and solubilize its components by altering cell polarity. Rhamnolipids also affect the cell surface appendages, which play important role to chain bacteria with each other in biofilms, hence could induce bacterial cell detachment (Aliyu, Smaldone, & Larson, 2017; de Araujo et al., 2016; e; e Silva, Carvalho, Aires, & Nitschke, 2017). Moreover, RLs absorb in biofilm matrix via water channels, reducing the interfacial tension and attraction between\nsurface material and biofilm thus leading to the detachment of microcolonies (Elshikh et al., 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2019). These results coincide with the previous study (Khalid et al., 2019), where RLs coatings on nano delivery systems improved the antiadhesive and antibiofilm properties of nano-systems against both Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens."

      "heading" : "3.8.1. Cumulative release of nisin",
      "text" : "Fig. 6-I displays the cumulative percentage release of nisin from RSNVs and liposomes at pH 4. Non-functionalized liposomes exhibited a typical initial rapid burst release (20%) and almost 60% of loaded nisin was released from liposomes during first 8 h. Whereas, RSNVs exhibited no burst release with overall slower release of nisin (29%) during first 8 h. Controlled, linear and sustained release of nisin was observed from RSNVs (up to 50%) till 48 h before reaching a plateau.\nHigher release of nisin from liposomes at pH 4 might be due to rapid increase in size of liposomes in the acidic environment, which suggests sensitivity of liposome at pH 4. The exposure to acidic pH leads to the protonation of phosphate group that suppresses the charge repulsion in the bilayer and promotes destabilization, leading to significant fusogenic effect and releasing the encapsulated drugs (Dizaj, Lotfipour, Barzegar-Jalali, Zarrintan, & Adibkia, 2014).\nSimilarly, at pH 7, almost 30% of nisin was released from liposomes and less than 8% of nisin was released from RSNVs (Fig. 6-II) during first 8 h. Overall, rhamnosomes exhibited better controlled release of bacteriocin than liposomes. A recent study has also reported that incorporation of different polymers on the surface of liposomes improves their stability and controlled release over different pH and temperature values (Du et al.; El-Houssiny et al., 2016).\nThus, incorporation of rhamnolipid monomers in the phospholipid bilayer not only stabilizes the liposome structure at acidic and neutral pH but also improves the encapsulation and controlled release of bacteriocin to control MDR food pathogens."

      "heading" : "3.8.2. Bacteriocin release kinetics",
      "text" : "Nisin release data was fitted into various kinetics models e.g. zero order, first order, Hixson Crowell, Higuchi and Korsmeyer-Peppas to evaluate the release mechanism (Table 4). In Korsmeyer-Peppas release model, different values of “η” suggest the types of diffusion. e.g. values of “η” ≤ 0.45, 0.45–0.89 and > 0.89 demonstrate the release from NVs as Fickian diffusion ( Prakash Upputuri & Azad Mandal, 2017), anomalous non Fickian or case II diffusion (which occur by mechanical deformation of the nano-structures in response to the swelling stress) and super case II transport, which is due to the relaxation of the nano structure, respectively. In our study, release from LNVs at both pH (η values≤ 0.45) was observed as a Fickian release, and the release was through diffusion from higher concentration (inside NVs) to lower concentration (outside NVs) with an initial burst release. Similar results were observed by Fernández-Romero, Maestrelli, Mura, Rabasco, & González-Rodríguez, 2018, where curcumin released from liposomes through Fickian diffusion (Fernández-Romero et al., 2018). Similarly, for RSNVs, the observed “η” values were 0.45 and 0.52 at pH 4 and 7.4 respectively. These values suggest that sustained release of nisin from RSNVs was non Fickian or case II diffusion (predominance in\nanomalous transport) which involves erosion and diffusion after swelling of NVs. This data suggest that nisin adsorbed on the surface of RSNVs (through hydrophobic interaction with RLs monomers in RSNVs) will release through erosion of RLs moieties from the membrane of vesicle, while remaining nisin entrapped inside the NVs will release through diffusion after swelling of nano-vesicles."

Functionalized nano-liposomes effectively controlled the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative foodborne bacteria. RSNVs displayed better antibiofilm activity by the synergistic action of nisin and RLs as compared to conventional liposomes. RSNVs provided sustained release of nisin through diffusion (Fickian) at various physiological and food storage conditions. Thus, rhamnosomes can offer an innovative yet viable solution for the sustained release of antimicrobial peptides to ensure food safety with extended shelf-life."

    "abstractText" : "Synthetic lipid membranes are considered as promising food-grade nano vesicles (NVs), but their functionalization is required to empower them as active-nano vesicle systems. In this study, rhamnosomes (RS) were developed by engineering the membrane of nano-liposomes with antimicrobial surfactant i.e. rhamnolipids (RL). Intrinsically active rhamnosome nano-vesicles (RSNVs) were loaded with bacteriocin (nisin Z) to acquire broadspectrum antimicrobial activity. Addition of rhamnolipids into the lipid bilayer exhibited an increase in the encapsulation efficiency of nisin from 47 ± 4% to 88 ± 7%. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Zetasizer revealed that the surface functionalization with RL increased the size of vesicles from 145 ± 2 nm to 209 ± 4 nm. Whereas, the zeta potential of nisin-loaded RSNVs was −20 ± 0.25mV as compared to −3.47 ± 0.13mV for loaded nano-liposomes, indicating higher physical stability of RSNVs. RSNVs not only demonstrated higher antimicrobial activity than liposomes but also enhanced the activity of nisin against Grampositive and Gram-negative resistant foodborne pathogens including L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Almost 80% reduction in biofilm biomass was observed when treated with nisin-loaded RSNVs due to its improved binding with bacterial surface. Thus, surface-active nanoliposomes (intrinsically active) with higher stability can provide an innovative strategy to control the biofilm-forming food associated pathogens.",
