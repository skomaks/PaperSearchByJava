      "text" : "Microorganisms are everywhere, around us and deeply within us. Some of them are beneficial and while other cause major sepsis, mortality and further, modernization is enhancing these challenging issues. Despite immense advancement in diagnosis and treatment, the microbial infections are acknowledged cause of chronic sepsis, morbidity, and mortality. Available reports showed that more than 3 billon people die due to microbial infection and their contamination in developing countries (Baranwal et al. 2018). The emergence of bacterial resistance toward antibiotics is becoming the major challenging conditions. This issue has led to the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) bacterial strain and superbacteria, which shows resistance to nearly all antibiotics. The reason behind this is the wide use and abuse of antibiotic which leads to evolutionary process in bacteria, both genetically and morphologically (Wang et al. 2017). The mechanism of resistance includes expression of efflux pumps, modification of cell components, and expression of some enzymes such as aminoglycosides. Further, a gene NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase) is a supergene that is responsible for broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance in superbacteria (Hsueh 2010). Apart from these, most bacterial species interact with each other to form microbial aggregates on a solid surface and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) which is secreted outside by these bacteria itself. These bacterial aggregates on EPS are specifically known as biofilm. These biofilms act as a protective covering for the bacteria in unfavorable environmental conditions and act as a barrier for antibiotics which inhibit their access to the bacteria that leads to continuous growth resulting in a mature biofilm. Further, these mature biofilm bacteria can invade the immune system by producing the superantigen within the biofilm.\nG. Arya · N. Sharma · R. Mankamna · S. Nimesh (*) Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Rajasthan, Ajmer, India\n90\nThus, these biofilms are also a serious threat to biomedical and healthcare section (Arima et al. 2018; Zhu et al. 2018).\nTo combat these issues of microbial resistance and biofilm, recent advancement in nanostructured formulation has occurred that is raising a hope in antimicrobial medication. The most accepted mechanism of nanostructure formulation, nanoparticles (NPs), is that they directly contact with the bacterial cell wall and destabilize them. These NPs do not need to penetrate inside the cell wall and this is the reason that the antibiotic resistance mechanisms are irrelevant for these particles (Edmundson et al. 2013). These NPs, both organic and inorganic, have antibacterial properties against a wide range of bacteria. Among all the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), the inorganic one is of great interest of researchers as antimicrobial agent because of their effectiveness, versatile applications, and potential to enhance the effect of conventional antibacterial agents toward multidrug resistance bacteria by synergism (Siddiqi et al. 2018; Aziz et al. 2014, 2015, 2016). If we traced back in history, before the introduction of antibiotics, silver in various forms (metallic silver, silver salt and silver colloids) has been extensively used throughout for a variety of configuration including vessels, water preserver in the form of liquid container and silver coins, shaving, sutures, and medicinal purposes for which it was first documented in 750 AD (Alexander 2009; Maillard and Hartemann 2013).\nThe journey of silver to silver nanoparticles occurs due to dynamic development of nanotechnology. Earlier silver has been used in the form of silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, and silver zeolite (Rai et al. 2012). The advantage of AgNPs over silver salt is due to their unique property of having highly developed and larger surface area to volume ratio which leads to higher bioavailability and allows increased antimicrobial activity than the bulk material. Further, silver nanoparticles have been proven to show less toxicity in comparison to silver (in its ionic form), even at same molar concentration. The antibacterial potential of AgNPs has high influence based on their physicochemical properties, i.e., size, morphology, charge, and stability. These physicochemical properties further depend on the method of their synthesis and preparation condition like nature of solvent, strength of reducing agent, concentration, and temperature (Kedziora et al. 2018).\nAccording to the market survey, AgNPs, among all nanomaterials, is the leading commercialized nanoparticles that accounts for more than 50% of the global nanomaterial consumer products. It is estimated that the annual manufacture market of AgNPs goes up to 320 tons production which have been used for healthcare and food products only and the global market is known to surpass over 3 billion by 2020. Due to its unique antibacterial and antifungal properties, their preference is rising in textile, water treatment, agriculture, paint industry, and food and beverage packing industry (Adibzadeh et al. 2014; Ahmadi and Adibhesami 2017; Li et al. 2017). Various approaches are available for their production that is broadly categorized into two groups, i.e., top-down and bottom-up (Fig. 6.1).\nTop-down method includes physical processes that include the breakdown of solid into nanoparticles, whereas bottom-up method includes synthesis of nanoparticles from silver ions by employing chemical, photochemical, and biological reactions.\nG. Arya et al.\n91\nThe physical and chemical methods of synthesis are expensive, generate toxic byproducts, and have high-energy requirements. To mask these issues of toxicity, biological methods that include microorganism and plant-based synthesis have evolved as one of the most promising options in the AgNP biosynthesis (Singh et al. 2016; Prasad 2014). Among them, plant-based synthesis of AgNPs is considered as very cost- effective and less laborious (Joshi et al. 2018). Several Phyto-constituents possesses both protective and reductive properties that are mainly responsible for the reduction of silver ions to AgNPs. Several studies have been done for biosynthesis of AgNPs from plant extracts including Rheum turkestanicum, Salvia lerifolia, Terminalia arjuna, Prosopis juliflora, Canarium ovatum, Cicer arientinum, Cordia dicotoma, and Dicoma tomentosa. Here in these studies, the synthesized AgNPs showed very efficient antimicrobial potential (Fig. 6.2) (Ahmed et al. 2017; Arya et al. 2016, 2017a, b; Baghayeri et al. 2018; Geeta et al. 2017; Kumari et al. 2016; Taghavizadeh Yazdi et al. 2018).\n6 Antimicrobial Silver Nanoparticles: Future of Nanomaterials\n92\nIn the present chapter, we will focus and discuss the current scenario and recent advancement of silver nanoparticles as antimicrobial agent in widespread domains such as healthcare, textile, and water treatment. Further, we will discuss their possible challenges and future prospects."

      "text" : "By reaching to a nanometer platform, silver tends to show unique properties and a strong correlation exists between morphology (shape and size) and physical properties of silver nanoparticles on biological platform. Cellular uptake, cellular activation, intracellular distribution and the antibacterial potential of these nanoparticles are highly influenced depending on the shape, size, and surface charge of these nanoparticles. Further, the size, morphology, and stability of AgNPs are strongly influenced by various parameters of reaction including methods of synthesis, reducing agent, and stabilizing agent. So, by controlling specific parameters, we can control the specific physicochemical properties of our particles. The nanoparticles synthesis reaction consists of three steps, (i) nucleation, (ii) seeding or coalescence, and (iii) growth (Fig.  6.3) in the solution, and by changing the kinetic and\nG. Arya et al.\n93\nthermodynamics of reaction at each stage, we can control the size and shape of the particles.\nHere is a brief description of factors that affects the antimicrobial potential of these silver nanoparticles."

      "heading" : "6.2.1 Size of the Particles",
      "text" : "The size of nanoparticles is the unique characterization which is one of the key deciding factors for their antimicrobial activity. The smaller particles have larger surface area-to-volume ratio for the interaction of microorganism and show better antimicrobial activity. A reduction of size range of particles from 10 μm to 10 nm leads to increase the interaction by increasing the surface area to 109 (Pal et  al. 2007). Ample amount of studies has been conducted to evaluate the size-dependent antimicrobial potential of synthesized AgNPs.\nAgnihotri et  al. performed the antimicrobial efficacy experiment with sizecontrolled silver nanoparticles over the range of 5–100  nm. Here the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bacteriostatic concentration (MBC) were performed against eight bacteria including four strains of E. coli, two strains of B. subtilis, and two strains of S. aureus. The results of their experiment revealed that among all sizes, the best results for antibacterial effect were obtained from 5, 7, and 10 nm, and among them 5 nm demonstrated fastest results against all the test strains (Agnihotri et al. 2014). Raza et al. synthesized particles in the set of S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 which were in the size range of 30–80, 150, 25–70, 15–50, and 30–200 nm. They performed disk diffusion assay against E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They observed that all synthesized particles showed good antibacterial effect, but the maximum zone of inhibition (ZOI), i.e., 8 mm, was obtained through S4 sample after antibiotic ZOI (11.3 mm) due to their smaller size range (Raza et al. 2016). After that, Kim et  al. showed the size effective studies against growth of bacteria. They synthesized different size ranges of particles with 70, 20, and 10 nm of spherical shape and evaluated against GFP-expressing E. coli for their comparative antimicrobial effect. The maximum zone of inhibition was observed with 10 nm treatment. Further, they performed comparative study for shape-dependent antimicrobial effect (Kim et al. 2017b). Further, Dogru et al. used green method where different size of particles was synthesized using extract of Matricaria chamomilla reduction. The particles were synthesized with 70 ± 5, 52 ± 5, and 37 ± 5 nm and tested against S. aureus and E. coli. Here the results demonstrated that particles with all three ranges showed inhibitory effect even at 6.25 ppm and among these, particle with 37 ± 5 showed highest inhibitory potential (Dogru et al. 2017).\nAll the studies mentioned here are satisfactory to the previous studies where finer AgNPs tend to have better antimicrobial activity than the larger one. But some exceptions are still found in the study of Ginjupalli et al. where they synthesized particles in different set of ranges including 10–20 nm, 30–50 nm, 50–80 nm, and 80–100 nm; they performed disk-diffusion assay against E. coli and Staphylococcus\n6 Antimicrobial Silver Nanoparticles: Future of Nanomaterials\n94\naureus, and the obtained results here revealed that the particles having 80–100 nm size only showed antibacterial potential in dose-dependent manner and other size of particles does not show the activity (Ginjupalli et al. 2018)."

      "heading" : "6.2.2 Shape of the Particles",
      "text" : "The antibacterial potential of AgNPs not only be influenced by size; it is highly influenced by their shape too. The particles can be synthesized in different shapes including spherical, near spherical, nano-cubes, nanorods, triangular or pyramid, truncated triangular, nanowires, nano-bars, nano-prism, flower shaped, octahedral and tetrahedral (Chang et al. 2011; Xia et al. 2013).\nGao et al. synthesized silver nanoparticles with triangle, nanoplate, and nanosphere through chemical reduction method where L-ascorbic acid is used as reductant and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as surface modification or protectant agent. These three different shaped AgNPs were then compared for their antibacterial potential against E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa through both disk diffusion and broth dilution method. Here the results indicate that the nanosphere exhibits better antibacterial potential as compared to Ag triangles and Ag nanoplates (Gao et al. 2013). In the study of Logaranjan et al., they synthesized octahedral AgNPs by biological method where aloe vera plant extract was used as reducing agent at room temperature and under microwave irradiation. The resulted particles were synthesized in the size range of 5–50 nm and compared to chemically synthesized nanoparticles for their antimicrobial effect against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and E. coli. The obtained results here revealed that the octahedral particles are showing two- to fourfold higher activity as compared to other particles (Logaranjan et al. 2016).\nHelmlinger et al. also experimentally showed that different morphology of silver nanoparticles shows different extents of antimicrobial effect. Here the results showed that nanoplates showed higher toxicity toward bacteria in comparison to nanosphere and nanorods. Nanocubes among all these served as somewhat less effective against bacteria (Helmlinger et al. 2016).\nIn 2017, the study of Kim et al. as mentioned above after size effect they performed comparative studies of antibacterial effect with respect to their shape or morphology against GFP-expressing E. coli. Here synthesized particles were in cube, triangular plate, and spherical shape, and the size range of all the shapes was in 70 nm. The results of disk diffusion assay evaluate that the triangular plate AgNPs showed the highest ZOI comparative to the cubic and spherical nanoparticles. Further, the MIC and MBC results showed that 150 ng/ml dose of spherical- and plate-shaped nanoparticles inhibits the bacterial growth completely, whereas the required dose of cubic AgNPs was 1500 ng/ml for complete inhibition. So, their study revealed the pattern of antimicrobial effect with respect to shape is triangular plate NPs > spherical > cube (Kim et al. 2017b).\nG. Arya et al.\n95\nFurther, Chakraborty et al. did experimental studies in which they suggested that the shape of the synthesized nanoparticles can be tuned by using protein in synthesis and protection or capping process. They used eight different proteins including lysozyme, apo-transferrin, avidin, β-lactoglobulin, BSA, hemoglobin, ovalbumin, and catalase. For the synthesis of different shaped particles, firstly Ag+ were reduced to Ag cluster through citric acid salt. The clusters were then mixed with different proteins for AgNP growth. Further in the same pattern, particles were synthesized in the presence of different amino acids for investigation of the role of individual amino acid in shape control mechanism. The results here showed that alanine, glycine, isoleucine, serine, threonine, and valine dictate anisotropic nanoparticles, whereas lysine and cystine lead to broad size distributed spherical particles. The rest of amino acid only showed the nonsignificant optical featured reaction product. Further, among all amino acid protected AgNPs, only lysine protection (other degrades within 2 hour of synthesis) is the one, which resulted in the formation of chemically stable particles. Further, it was observed that free lysine and lysine in the protein affect differently on the shape and can lead to anisotropic growth. To evaluate this effect, a number of experiments were performed that revealed a high number of accessible lysines are responsible for anisotropic growth of nanoparticles (Chakraborty et al. 2018).\nRecently, Acharya et al. in 2018 have synthesized particles using chemical reduction method with spherical and rod shapes. They performed disk diffusion method and MIC to compare their antimicrobial effect against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus. They found that both the candidates showed good antibacterial activity and in case of K. pneumoniae the spherical-shaped AgNPs showed higher activity as compared to rod-shaped AgNPs. The results also revealed that in case of both spherical and rod AgNPs, the (111) plane is responsible for their antimicrobial effect (Acharya et al. 2018)."

      "heading" : "6.2.3 Electric Charge on the Surface of Silver Nanoparticles",
      "text" : "The electric charge on the surface of AgNPs tends to contribute effective variation on the potential bioactivity of the particles. Depending on the method of synthesis, different surface charges can exhibit on the surface of particles. Generally, the stabilizer and the capping agent in the synthesis procedure are employed to change the surface charge that can provide stability and influence the bioactivity of the AgNPs.\nSilva et al. synthesized organo-coated silver nanoparticles having positive, negative, and highly negative charge on the surface. These three coated AgNPs were further compared with AgNO3. Here, for synthesis of coated charged AgNPs, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), citrate, and branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI) were employed as stabilizers that were responsible for negative (−7), highly negative (−20), and positive charge (+28) AgNPs, respectively. Further, these particles were evaluated for comparative study of their antibacterial potential against two model bacteria, i.e., E. coli and Daphnia magna. The results here indicate that among all\n6 Antimicrobial Silver Nanoparticles: Future of Nanomaterials\n96\nthe three charged coated nanoparticles, BPEI-AgNPs showed the maximum antibacterial potential by E. coli bioassay (% inhibition of β-galactosidase) and Daphnia magna mortality assay (% of mortality). The reason behind this was the smaller particle size of the particle and the most importantly the positive charge on the surface, i.e., +28 that leads to effective electrostatic interaction of particles to the cell membrane of bacteria. In case of E. coli, the EC50 (effective concentration) value of BPEI-AgNPs, citrate-AgNPs, and PVP-AgNPs were evaluated as 305, 791, and 2040 μg/L, respectively. Further, in case of Daphnia magna, the LC50 values (median lethal concentration) were observed as 0.45, 2.69, and 4.71  μg/L with respect to above (Silva et al. 2014).\nFurther, the study was also supported by Abbaszadegan et al. They conducted the study to evaluate the effect of neutral AgNPs for their antimicrobial potential in comparison to negatively and positively charged AgNPs. Here they investigate their study against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans) and Gram-negative (E. coli and Proteus vulgaris) bacteria. For this study, they firstly synthesized AgNPs with different surface charges. For negatively charged particles, sodium borohydride was used as a reductant and rice starch was used for the synthesis of neutral AgNPs. For positively charged particle synthesis, AgNO3 were mixed with 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and sodium borohydride was added. Further to investigate antibacterial potential, both well diffusion and microdilution method were performed against the panel of bacteria mentioned above. From the results, it was evaluated that in well diffusion assay, the highest inhibition zone was presented by the positively charged AgNPs against all test organism, in all concentrations. Further microdilution (MIC) results suggested that the positively charged AgNPs are much active and effective at 100 to 1000 times lower concentrations as compared to negative and neutral AgNPs and even the size of these particles (i.e., 19 nm and 20 nm, respectively) are smaller than positively charged particles (24 nm) (Abbaszadegan et al. 2015).\nIn contrast to this, Salvioni et al. (2017) conducted a study where they synthesized water-soluble, negatively charged AgNPs through the reduction of citric acid and tannic acid. They assessed their synthesized AgNPs against Gram-negative E. coli MG1665 and Gram-positive Staphylococcus bacteria for MIC and compared to the commercially available AgNPs, i.e., citrate-stabilized AgNPs, CSNPs (colloidal silver nanoparticles), and silver ion in the form of AgNO3. The results here evaluated that the best antibacterial efficacy was shown by the synthesized AgNPs as compared to AgNPs, CSNPs, and AgNO3. As compared to synthesized AgNPs (20 nm), the AgNPs have larger size (40 nm) that possess significantly smaller surface area which leads to decreased interaction of bacteria and reduced Ag+ release. In case of CSNPs, even the smallest size of, i.e., 5 nm, the antibacterial potential is very low. As the CSNPs attributed to a strongly elevated surface tension, the stability of these particles is reduced in biological media and tends to behave like Ag ions. From the previous studies, it was observed that positive charge is an essential condition for the effective antibacterial potential of AgNPs because it facilitates the effective electrostatic interaction of AgNPs to the negatively charged bacterial cell wall. But here the results are showing just contrast where negative charge of the particle\nG. Arya et al.\n97\ncontributes more effective antibacterial potential. They suggested that these negatively charged AgNPs represent a safety concern for mammalian cells and tissue by giving a possibility that the cationic NPs show more cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells compared to neutral or negative surface-charged particles. They also experimentally suggested that the Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus), due to the presence of a thicker peptidoglycan cell wall, require tenfold higher concentration as compared to Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli) (Salvioni et al. 2017).\nThus, from the studies, it is concluded that the surface charge of the particles rises as the most important factor over other parameters (size and morphology) that confer the antibacterial potential. The electrostatic interaction of negatively charged bacterial cell membrane with positively charged AgNPs leads to effectiveness of antibacterial potential while the negatively charged AgNPs lead to the safety or less cytotoxicity toward the mammalian cell that is a major issue of concern with AgNPs."

      "text" : "Silver nanoparticles are well known for their antimicrobial potential which demonstrates greater toxicity toward microorganism as compared to other metallic nanoparticles. These particles are also regarded as the next-generation antibiotics due to their emergence as an alternative to antibiotic therapy. These particles have been evaluated for their antimicrobial potential against a broad range of microbes including bacteria (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), fungi, and viruses. Further, these particles showed efficacy against various multidrug resistance (MDR) bacteria. Despite ample amount of work being done and further progressively occurring, the precise mechanism of their action of antimicrobial effect is still not completely known (Dakal et al. 2016).\nThe antibacterial activity of the silver nanoparticles is mainly associated with the generation of silver ions and several evidences are there that suggest that these silver ions Ag+ are associated with the surface area of the particles. It was evidenced that the higher surface area of the particles is responsible for the release of higher concentration of Ag+ that leads to increased antimicrobial effect, whereas lower surface area releases lower concentration and ultimately decreased antimicrobial effect (Möhler et al. 2018). Hence, we can say that the antimicrobial property of silver nanoparticles is associated with the quantity and the grade of silver released. Further, the toxicological pathway of silver nanoparticles toward bacteria depends on particles and physicochemical properties. The ample amount of work in this area has shown that silver nanoparticles can disrupt more than one cellular and metabolic pathway of cells for their antibacterial mechanism action (Aziz et al. 2014, 2015, 2016; Abd-Elsalam and Prasad 2018). The mechanism can be broadly categorized into two groups: (1) nonoxidative mechanism and (2) oxidative mechanism (Fig. 6.4).\n6 Antimicrobial Silver Nanoparticles: Future of Nanomaterials\n98"

      "heading" : "6.3.1.1 Cell Wall and Cell Membrane Attachment in Bacteria",
      "text" : "Silver nanoparticles, when comes in contact with bacterial cells or other microorganisms, the positive charge these particles confer the strong electrostatic interaction to the negative charge on the membrane which facilitate the adhesion or anchoring of these AgNPs to the cell wall. After attachment, some of these particles undergo dissociation into biologically active Ag+, and further, by Trojan horse mechanism, these ions bind to cell wall and release more Ag+ into the cell (Singh et al. 2015). These ions further interact with peptidoglycan layer, composed of sugar (β-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetyl muramic acid) and amine acid (Agnihotri et al. 2014). This interaction leads to the morphological changes which include cytoplasmic shrinkages and detachment of cell membrane. Further, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies have revealed the formation of electrondense pits by cross-linking interaction between sugar and amino acid that leads to site-specific damage of the cell wall. These Ag+ also interact with sulfur-containing protein in the cell wall that affect the integrity of lipid bilayer and cause permeability. This permeability and pits formation affect the transport activity and disrupt the\nG. Arya et al.\n99\nphosphate ion and potassium ion pump. Ultimately the prolonged permeability leads to the leakage of cellular content out in the surrounding media and causes cell disintegration, and inhibition of cellular function leads to necrosis and cell death.\nFurther, this nonoxidative mechanism of antibacterial action also depends on bacteria type, whether Gram-positive or Gram-negative. In cash of Gram-positive bacteria, the cell wall is composed of 30 nm thick negatively charged peptidoglycan layer, whereas in Gram-negative bacteria, the layer is of Σ3–4 nm thickness. This structural and compositional difference makes the Gram-negative bacteria more susceptible for the antibacterial action of AgNPs rather than Gram-positive bacteria at same concentration. So, there exists a correlation between the effective concentration of AgNPs and the class of treated bacteria (Patil and Kim 2017)."

It was evidenced that the use of surfactant along with these AgNPs can enhance the penetration of AgNPs in the bacterial cells.\nAfter penetration of cell membrane, these particles interact with protein, lipid, DNA, and other biomolecules. Hsueh et al. and Kumar et al. suggested that these AgNPs interact with DNA which causes denaturation and shearing and causes DNA damage. Further, these AgNPs are responsible for the mutation in the essential DNA repair gene of mutant E. coli. These particles result in the loss of replicability of the DNA due to change in relaxed to the condensed state. The Ag+ generated by AgNPs interacts with purine and pyrimidine base separately and destabilize the double helical and β-sheet structure of DNA that leads to inhibition of transcription of gene (Hsueh et al. 2015; Kumar et al. 2016). This leads to inhibition of cell division and their reproduction. The AgNPs also inhibit the process of translation by interacting with the ribosomal subunit and lead to their denaturation. These ions are also responsible for the inhibition of proteins that are involved in the generation transmembrane ATP by reacting with their thiol group. The Ag+ also interact with the functional group of proteins and inhibit resulted in their deactivation. Further, these ions interact with synthesized protein and inhibit their overall functioning by altering their three-dimenstional structure or block their active binding site and leads to overall functional defect in the microorganism."

The AgNPs are responsible for the increased cellular oxidative stress in microbes that is associated with the antibacterial potential of the particles. The electron spin resonance spectroscopy studies evaluated that\n6 Antimicrobial Silver Nanoparticles: Future of Nanomaterials\n100\nthe increased concentration of Ag+ generated through AgNPs surface area after interaction with bacterial is expected to cause higher production of ROS and free radical. These ROS and free radical include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxy radical, superoxide anion (O2−), hydroxyl radical (OH), hypochlorous acid (HOCl), and singlet oxygen (Yang et al. 2011).\nDuring normal aerobic respiration, metabolic activity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic mitochondria, chloroplast, peroxisome, and cytosol generates ROS and free radical, and their level is maintained by scavenger like reduced glutathione (GSH). But when AgNPs interact with bacterial cells, the released Ag+ interact with the thiol group of reduced glutathione (convert reduced GSH to oxidized form glutathione disulfide GSSH) and other related enzymes that leads to disruption of scavenging mechanism (Tang and Zheng 2018). These Ag+ also bind to the cell membrane of bacteria and cause dysfunction of respiratory electron transporter chain and inhibit respiratory chain enzymes. Further, in the presence of dissolved oxygen, these Ag+ serve as catalyst for generation of ROS and free radical. This excessive number of ROS and free radical causes damage to mitochondrial membrane, singlestrand breakage in DNA components, and necrosis and leads to cell death. Further, hyperoxidation of protein, lipid, DNA, and cell membrane also result in increased ROS (Korshed et al. 2016; Prasad and Swamy 2013; Gupta et al. 2018; Prasad et al. 2017). In case of biologically synthesized AgNPs, the oxidative stress is caused by the elevated level of both ROS and reactive nitrogen intermediate (RNI). Reduction of RNI causes the oxidative stress that is like the effect of antibiotics (Quinteros et al. 2016).\nSignal transduction pathway affects the bacterial growth and other molecular and cellular activity. Further, the protein involved in the signal transduction pathway of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria is highly affected by the treatment of AgNPs that leads to inhibit growth and prevent various molecular and cellular activities, and we can say that particles can change the phosphorylation profile of bacterial peptides. So, to examine this offers a useful way to study the toxicity effect or the mechanistic behavior of AgNPs in bacteria (Dakal et al. 2016).\nIn general mode of action of silver nanoparticles results in:\n1. Attachment to the surface of cell membrane 2. Cause structural changes and damage to the cell wall. 3.

But along with this, it is the most exposed part and more prone to any cut and damage that can lead to chronic wound (Nam et al. 2015). These wounds or cuts on the skin are the leading source of bacterial and fungal infection first locally and then spread and become serious infection for the patients. These microbial infections in the wound area have been noted for the delaying in the process of wound healing and sometimes lead to major sepsis, resulting in death of individual (Wilkinson et al. 2011). Further diabetes and obesity patients also suffer with wound, their healing, and sepsis problem. From centuries, silver and its various forms are also known for their tremendous wound healing properties. More specifically green-synthesized silver nanoparticles have been proven to exhibit significant wound healing action (Gong et al. 2018). By taking the advantage of the strong broad-spectrum property of silver nanoparticles, these particles have been extensively being used for treatment of chronic wound healing and their dressing material. These AgNPs have been used as an active agent of large number of dressing material as silver-impregnated bandages and in the form of ointment or cream. These AgNP-coated dressings proved as effective dressing with nontoxicity that can decrease the chance of infection and further accelerate the healing time. Silver nanoparticles are beneficial for wound healing and dressing material due to their characteristic property of broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against MDR and biofilm-forming bacteria along with their anti-inflammatory property that promote wound healing by reducing cytokines release, decreasing mast cell infiltration and lymphocyte. Further these particles can be easily adsorbed on the dressing and cotton fabric that can be applied on the wound area and show\n6 Antimicrobial Silver Nanoparticles: Future of Nanomaterials\n102\nvery low level of toxicity along with improved mechanical properties (Gong et al. 2018; Gunasekaran et al. 2011).\nGuthrie et al. (2012) investigated antibacterial effect of silver-impregnated dressing in vitro and in vivo murine wound infected by S. aureus. In this study, author fabricated a silver-impregnated polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) film using poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) assembled on poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). This synthesized Ag-PEMs membrane was then analyzed both in vitro and in vivo for their antibacterial potential. The results of in vitro analysis revealed that the Ag-PEMs significantly reduce the concentration of S. aureus (up to 99.99%) as compared to unmodified PEM. Further, the in vivo results revealed that there is absence of any mortality, surgical complication, illness, or weight loss. The Ag-PEM-treated murine wound resulted in reduced bacterial burden in the skin wound as compared to control (Guthrie et al. 2012).\nPaladini et  al. (2013) synthesized silver nanoparticle-doped hydrogel of diphenylalanine which was modified with aromatic group. These doped hydrogels are proposed to show the antibacterial wound healing potential. So, the experiments are performed against S. aureus. The obtained results here suggested that the hydrogel provides the efficient antibacterial potential and moist environment which is required to prevent the infection and promote wound healing, respectively (Paladini et al. 2013).\nAnisha et al. (2013) prepared a nanocomposite sponge composed of chitosan, hyaluronic acid, and green-synthesized silver nanoparticles, and the sponge was prepared through freeze-drying method that resulted in a porous structure. This sponge was then evaluated for their antibacterial potential in wound dressing for diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) infection. The analysis was carried out against E. coli, S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumonia. The results here revealed that the nanocomposite sponge showed the effective antibacterial potential against all the test bacteria and the higher concentration of AgNPs (0.005%, 0.01% and 0.02%) containing sponge showed antibacterial potential against MRSA. The results of cytotoxicity study on human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells showed the concentration-dependent toxicity of AgNPs. In all, the results suggested that the synthesized sponge could be used as a potential material for wound dressing for DFU infected with resistant bacteria (Anisha et al. 2013).\nLin et al. (2014) prepared different concentration of silver containing activated carbon fiber for wound dressing material by using bio-medical carbon technology. After synthesis, this Ag-ACF dressing was evaluated for Ag concentration- dependent antimicrobial activity and wound healing efficacy. The result indicated that the concentration- dependent antimicrobial activity and wound area reduction that is higher concentration lead to effectively prevent the microbial growth and promote the wound healing process. Further, in  vivo experiment showed the synthesized Ag-ACF can promote infected wound healing in early phase as compared to the commercial silver dressing used in the same concentration-dependent manner and showed significant biocompatibility (Lin et al. 2014).\nMei et al. (2014) synthesized a cationic polymer poly 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (PDMAEMA-C4) reduced silver nanocomposite which display the\nG. Arya et al.\n103\nenhanced antibacterial potential against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria due to the synergistic behavior of AgNPs and capped polymer. The results here showed the effect of these synthesized nanocomposite leads to enhanced antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and improved wound area reduction. Ag@PDMAEMA-C4 also show the efficient antibacterial potential in diabetic rat model and effectively treat the bacterial infected wound (Mei et al. 2014).\nDas et al. (2015) prepared an amorphous hydrogel containing in situ synthesized AgNPs, propylene glycol, and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) in a single step by heating AgNO3 along with other ingredients. The synthesized hydrogel was then analyzed for their effective antimicrobial activity against MRSA, S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa. Further to check the wound healing properties, the in  vitro migration or proliferation assay was performed against human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells. The result showed that the hydrogel effectively reduces the bio-burden of all the test organism including MRSA at 50 ppm concentration. The migration and proliferation results showed the effective cytocompatibility of AgNPs-CMC on HDF cells (Das et al. 2015).\nDai et al. (2016) synthesized ɛ-polylysine polymer-reduced AgNPs by one-pot synthesis strategy. These EPL-g-butyl@AgNPs were in vitro analyzed for their antibacterial efficacy against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Further, in vivo antibacterial studies of these synthesized particles were carried on diabetic rat with bacterial infected wound. The results of in  vitro assay revealed the effective reduction of growth of bacteria in a dose-dependent manner in case of both bacteria. Further, the maximum ZOI was observed in EPL-g-butyl@AgNPs as compared to AgNPs alone and EPL-g-butyl alone. This was due to the polyvalent interaction and the synergistic effect of both moieties. The results of in vivo experiments showed potential antibacterial effect on the infected wound in diabetic rat model and revealed that the nanocomposite could modulate inflammatory cells thus promoting wound healing without side effect on dermal tissue (Dai et al. 2016).\nTonda-Turo et al. (2016) prepared biodegradable wound dressing using chitosanbased porous membrane via freeze-drying technique which was further impregnated with gentamicin and different ratios of AgNPs (5, 10, and 15%) to improve the antibacterial effect against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis, S. aureus, and E. faecalis. The results here showed the initial burst release of gentamicin on the first day of treatment, but then the decreased release rate was observed that was maintained up to 56 days against bacteria and, hence, can be used as good candidate against reduction of bacterial infection in wound (Tonda-Turo et al. 2016).\nKim et al. (2017a) synthesized a wound dressing material using a cotton wool coated with AgNPs. Here in this experiment, they used solution-dipping method which involves soaking the piece of cotton wool in the alcoholic silver-2 ethylhexyl- carbamates solution (0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0%), followed by thermal reduction at 120 °C. The AgNPs were synthesized on the cotton wool surface in the size range of 20–80 nm and analyzed for their blood clotting property and antibacterial potential against S. aureus and E. coli. The obtained results showed that the fabric coated with 0.5% AgNPs represents the fastest blood clotting and excellent\n6 Antimicrobial Silver Nanoparticles: Future of Nanomaterials\n104\nUV-blocking in the UV-R range as compared to the unmodified cotton wool. This fast clotting of blood was due to procoagulant activity of AgNPs which increase the concentration of thrombin. Further, the UV-blocking property of the fabric provides protection against intense UV rays. Further, the results of antibacterial assay also represent the maximum antibacterial effect, as shown by 0.5% AgNPs-coated cotton as compared to 0.01, 0.1, and unmodified cotton. All these results go with the essential factors required for wound dressing material (Kim et al. 2017a).\nAhmadi and Adibhesami (2017) performed a study to check the effect of AgNPs on wound contaminated with P. aeruginosa. Here the experiment was performed in four groups including negative control (normal saline), positive control (tetracycline), AgNPs alone, and AgNPs + tetracycline treatment. The three groups among them showed effective wound infection treatment where % of wound healing was observed as 98, 99, and 100% in AgNPs, tetracycline, and AgNPs + tetracycline, respectively. Along with this the least bacterial load was observed in case of AgNPs + tetracycline at the site of treatment. These results indicate that the AgNPs and tetracycline show synergistic effect together and the AgNPs are almost equally effective as the antibiotic treatment (Ahmadi and Adibhesami 2017).\nAdibhesami et al. (2017) investigated the in vivo effect of AgNPs in wound healing infected with S. aureus. The bacterial suspension was added on the back of mouse where a full-thickness skin wound is created. The AgNPs of 20 nm in diameter were used in this experiment. Here the mouse was divided into five groups including negative control (normal saline), positive control (Gentamicin 8 mg/kg), and different concentrations of AgNPs (0.08, 0.04, and 0.02 mg/kg). The results here revealed that AgNPs in 0.08 mg/Kg concentration showed the maximum acceleration in reduction of both wound area and the bacterial load as compared to other AgNPs concentration. On day 21, after treatment the bacterial counts in case of both gentamicin and AGNPs (0.08 mg/kg) were 0.00 CFUg−1, which show no significant difference, whereas, on day 14, the bacterial load of AgNPs was observed as 1.02 × 104 as compared to gentamicin, that is, 3.24 × 104. So, these observations suggested that the AgNPs more effectively reduce the bacterial infections and the wound area in comparison to antibiotics (Adibhesami et al. 2017).\nRecently, Liu et  al. (2018) prepared a hydrogel for wound dressing that was composed of cross-linked carbohydrate cellulose nanofiber (CNF), gelatin (G), and different concentrations of AgNPs (0.2 and 0.5 mg/ml). The antibacterial efficacy assessment was done via both liquid culture medium and agar disk diffusion. Here also CNF/G/Ag0.5 showed the better performance as compared to only CNF and only AgNPs. Further the results of in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity and wound healing demonstrate that CNF/G/Ag0.5 showed the maximum CNF/G/Ag0.5 exhibit the maximum biocompatibility, (appr. 100%) cell viability, and wound healing efficiency via efficient growth promoting effect. So, this hydrogel holds the efficient capability of both antibacterial infection and accelerates cell proliferation (Liu et al. 2018).\nG. Arya et al.\n105"

      "text" : "In the modern era, indwelling devices have become the major and key element in the treatment of various medical conditions. But all these modernizations are somewhere associated with risk of device-associated infections due to bacterial attachment and biofilm formation on the surface of medical devices which can spread the infection to the patients and cause serious sepsis (Bottros and Christo 2014; Smith and Nolan 2013). The AgNPs application, due to their antimicrobial activity, has been increasing in nanoparticle-based medical devices (Aziz et al. 2016). European and international regulator and occupational safety community have raised their vision toward AgNPs due to the pressing need to prevent the increasing healthcareassociated infections (HCAIs) (Marassi et al. 2018).\nFor this Kim et al. (2017c) developed methods to fabricate the film of silicon, impregnated with silver nanoparticles on a poly-dimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) bed. The AgNPs were then synthesized in situ by reduction of silver ions, and these AgNPs were then grown and allow to electrostatically bind to hydroxyl group formed on the surface of the film after treatment with air plasma. The reduction of AgNO3 occurred through sodium citrate. The film was then assessed for their antimicrobial efficacy against E. coli and B. subtilis. The results here showed 5 log10 times more reduction of bacterial species as compared to commercial AgNPmbedded films. So, according to author these films can be useful for the siliconbased implanting on device providing biosafety toward medical device-induced infections and sepsis (Kim et al. 2017c).\nFurther, Gomez-Carretero et al. (2017) have designed an electro-enhanced antimicrobial coating by using AgNPs. For this, an electrically conducting polymer layer was chemically synthesized using poly(hydroxymethyl 3, 4- ethylenedioxythiophen): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT-MeOH:PSS) and 3-(aminopropyl) tri-ethoxy-silane. PEDOT-MeOH:PSS was integrated with AgNPs. The coating was further analyzed for its antimicrobial potential against S. aureus (the major colonizing microbe of medical implants) in a comparative manner including electrical dressing and without electrical dressing. From the results it was evaluated that the electro-enhancement (electrical dressing) of the coating membrane showed the complete prevention of biofilm growth (Gomez-Carretero et al. 2017).\nBiofilm formation has been found to play role in various infections including catheterized blood stream and urinary tract infection that can lead to major sepsis and mortality. Dybowska-Sarapuk et  al. (2017) designed graphene nanolayer for coating of catheters in order to surmount these biofilm infection problems. Here the graphene layer was decorated with AgNPs by spray-coating system. This coating was further assessed for their antibiofilm efficacy against S. epidermidis bacteria. It was found that the coated layer of graphene prevents the biofilm completely from the surface of a Foley catheter. Further this method found to be very economic and useful for variety of substrate (Dybowska-Sarapuk et al. 2017).\nApart from antibacterial efficiency, AgNPs can enhance the sensitivity in medical devices. As in the study of Bai et al. (2018), they have designed a surface- enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based lateral flow assay strip (LFASs) for the quantitative\n6 Antimicrobial Silver Nanoparticles: Future of Nanomaterials\n106\nanalysis of biomarkers in low concentration range. Here the authors have enhanced the sensitivity of the probe by using AgNPs along with the widely used AuNPsLFASs. Here citrate reduction method was used and three forms of citrate capped bio-metallic NPs including Au core with Ag shell NPs (Au@ AgNPs), rattle-like Au core in Ag-Au shell NPs (Au@ Ag-AuNPs) and Ag-AuNPs were synthesized that can be used as optical probe. These synthesized nanocomposites were then evaluated for their solution-based SERS activities. In a detection model, the probe was chosen for the detection of a specific biomarker cTn-I (cardiac troponin- I) for cardiac injury. The results here indicated that the citrate-capped rattle-like Au core in Ag-Au shell NPs (Au@ Ag-AuNPs) exhibit the maximum activity of SERS among all three and were used as both optical and SERS probe in LFASs. The probe was able to detect the signal even at 0.09 ng/ml and that limit can be further lowered by optimization (Bai et al. 2018)."

      "text" : "The burn injury resulted in the modulation of patient’s immune system in which the function of immune cells is suppressed. Further, this leads to increase the susceptibility toward various infections. The mortality rate in case of burn injury patient was mainly due to the sepsis which was due to the massive release of various inflammatory mediators including interleukins (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL 10), inflammatory cytokines, and interferon-gamma (INF-γ). Further, it was observed the IL-10 deficiency or aberrant expression leads to inflammatory bowel disease and several autoimmune disease (Shaheen 2016). Silver nanoparticles, due to their effective antibacterial, anti- inflammatory, and angiogenic properties, have potential application in the treatment of burn care injuries and wounds (Gurunathan et  al. 2009; Nadworny et al. 2008).\nMuniyan et al. (2017) synthesized AgNPs by using a green eco-friendly manner which showed the effective antibacterial potential against bacterial species related to severe burn wound infection including E. faecalis, S. aureus, A. baumannii, E. asburiae, E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. For the synthesis purpose, they use fenugreek seed as a source of saponins and used for the reduction of AgNO3 to produce saponin-capped AgNPs (SN-AgNPs). The results of both disk diffusion assay and MIC revealed that the synthesized SN-AgNPs efficiently show their antibacterial potential against all test organisms. The enhanced potential was due to the synergistic effect of saponin (that can cause destabilization of the permeability of bacterial membrane) and AgNPs (Muniyan et al. 2017).\nLuna-Hernandez et  al. (2017) synthesized chitosan and silver NPs composed film with ultralow silver level and without aggregation of AgNPs for dressing of thermal burn wounds. The application of this nanocomposite film in the treatment of burn wound resulted in the higher antibacterial potency even at 10 nm concentration of AgNPs embedded in the film against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa infection. The healing of wound is also observed by inducing increased myofibroblast, collagen remolding, new blood vessel formation, and regeneration of epiderma after\nG. Arya et al.\n107\n7  days of treatment. Further, these synthesized nanocomposites are able to show biocompatibility and, hence, can be a potent material for burn wound care (Luna- Hernandez et al. 2017).\nStojkovska et al. (2018) prepared alginate and silver nanoparticle-based nanocomposites for the treatment of wounds that were due to second-degree thermal burn in model Wistar rat. Here electrochemical method was firstly used to synthesize AgNPs, which were then mixed with alginate solution to obtain microfibers for in vivo application. The infected rats were then divided into five groups for different levels of treatment to perform a comparative study. The groups include G1 (untreated wound), G2 (commercial cream containing silver sulfadiazine), G3 (AgNPs/alginate and ascorbic acid), G4 (Ca-alginate containing Ag+), G5 (wet AgNPs/alginate microfiber), and G6 (dry AgNPs/alginate microfiber). The in vivo experiment results revealed that the maximum wound healing was observed in group G4, G5, and G6 in a shortest period of 19 days. Whereas G2 and G3 showed significant wound healing after 21 days and G1, the untreated wound takes 25 days. Further, the histopathological studies showed the results of enhanced granulation and reepithelialization in the same manner. There results have shown the effective potential of the synthesized nanocomposites based on alginate and AgNPs for burn wound treatment (Stojkovska et al. 2018)."

      "heading" : "6.4.1.4 Bone Cement",
      "text" : "Bone is complex structure which is composed of living cells embedded in a biomineral matrix (consisting 30% organic and 70% inorganic material). The solid bone is formed by hardening of this biomineral matrix around the entrapped cells. The orthopedic extremity trauma leads to complication of larger segment bony defect and nonunion (Kanakaris and Giannoudis 2007). Further the tissue barrier loss between the site of fracture and external environment leads to the susceptibility of bacterial infection and sepsis. For larger segment loss of bone, the conventional treatment and repair method includes use of polymeric cement spacer. The spacer embedded with antibiotics is generally nondegradable. These conventional methods are associated with limitation as (1) the embedded antibiotic effect locally due to poor release and rise in antibiotic resistance. (2) The spacer removal by second operation and (3) the cement spacer can cause bacterial biofilm infection (Behzadi et al. 2017).\nNanotechnology application, by designing and engineering of nanomaterials, opens a new way that can surmount the issue of conventional therapies (Farokhzad and Langer 2006). Nanoparticles incorporation gives an alternative to antibiotics that can resolve the multidrug resistance issues (Guzman et al. 2012; Montanaro et al. 2011). Among metal, silver nanoparticles are best suited for this purpose due to their anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and most importantly antibiotic and antibiofilm activity. An ample amount of work has been progressing in this area (Gurunathan et al. 2009; Nadworny et al. 2008).\n6 Antimicrobial Silver Nanoparticles: Future of Nanomaterials\n108\nGonzález-Sánchez et al. (2015) synthesized methacrylate hydrogel for artificial bone graft application with incorporation of silver nanoparticles in it. In their work, they first synthesized silver nanoparticles using sodium citrate reduction, and these particles were then integrated into the hydrogel at two different (0.5 and 1 mM) concentrations. The integration was done by using three different methods including entrapment of AgNPs before mineralization, diffusion, and adsorption after mineralization. The synthesized hydrogels were then assessed for their antimicrobial potential against S. epidermis and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The results revealed that among the three cross-linking methods, only adsorption of AgNPs on biomineralized hydrogel represents the antibacterial efficiency. Further the potential was independent of the concentration of AgNPs cross-linking. The cytotoxicity results on osteoblast (MC-3T3) cells represent the nontoxicity, and no detrimental consequence was observed on rheological characterization (GonzálezSánchez et al. 2015).\nZhang et al. (2016) modified alginate with mussel-inspired dopamine to prepare a gel which was coated by AgNPs. The gel was expected to promote the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells and reduce the bacterial infections. The comparative study was performed using alginate-dopamine and alginate-dopamineAgNPs beads and fibers. The resulted gel showed efficient antibacterial potential against S. aureus and E. coli; the gel also showed the excellent cell viability and bone regeneration activity even in contaminated bone (Zhang et al. 2016).\nZhang et al. (2017) prepared bio-ceramic scaffold using β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) which was further modified with silver and graphene oxide nanoparticles (Ag@GO) via liquid chemical reduction approach. The nanocomposites were then prepared in different Ag to GO mass ratio. The antibacterial potential was assessed against E. coli where the results revealed that the β-TCP scaffold modified Ag@GO does not show effective antibacterial activity but positively promotes the expression of osteoblast-related gene. Further, nanocomposite of Ag and GO showed reduction in bacterial growth (Zhang et al. 2017).\nFurther, a novel 3D printed polyetheretherketone (PEEK) has been developed by Deng et al. (2017) via catecholamine chemistry which was surface decorated with AgNPs. For in  vitro antimicrobial and antibiofilm analysis, comparative study between 3D PEEK and 3D PEEK/Ag (1 mM) was performed against E. coli and S. aureus. The results here showed that the 3D PEEK/Ag (1 mM) showed the efficient contact killing and release killing. Further, it was effective for the rupture of biofilm. The in vitro studies of MG-63 cells, via LDH assay and ALP test, also revealed 3D PEEK/Ag (1 mM) exhibit maximum activity in both experiment and is proven as potential scaffold for osteoblastic differentiation (Deng et al. 2017).\nAurore et al. (2018) performed their study to evaluate the effect of silver nanoparticles against the osteoclast infection by S. aureus and E. coli. Here the study revealed the mechanistic behavior of antibacterial effect of AgNPs toward bacteria in which ROS moiety increased that is responsible for reduction of bio-burden of S. aureus and E. coli (Aurore et al. 2018).\nFurther to achieve osteoinductivity along with antibacterial properties, Mao et al. recently (in 2018) prepared microsphere (PM) of strontium ranelate (SR)-loaded\nG. Arya et al.\n109\npoly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) which was assembled with AgNPs and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HANPs). The SR-PM-Ag-HA microsphere was prepared using solid-in-oil nanosuspension method. The in  vitro studies were conducted in a comparative manner between PM, SR-PM, SR-PM-Ag, and SR-PMAg-HA. The results revealed that all the synthesized microspheres are biocompatible against MC3T3-E1 cells, and except PM, all other form of microsphere showed adequate drug release efficiency along with effective proliferation. The best osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells was exhibited by SR-PM- Ag-HA. Further the antibacterial analysis and antibiofilm assay against S. epidermis and MRSA bacteria revealed that SR-PM-Ag-HA and SR-PM-Ag showed effective potential in both bacteria (Mao et al. 2018)."

Silver nanoparticles due to their effective antimicrobial properties have been extensively used in dental restoration materials that show efficiency against the bacteria producing carries, i.e., Streptococci and Lactobacillus (Melo et al. 2013). Along with its antibacterial potential these particles effectively provide strength to the incorporated selfetching materials that can further help in restoration dentistry (Fatemeh et  al. 2017).\nFan et al. in 2014 conducted study to evaluate the effect of silver nanoparticles in the growth inhibition of bacterial colonization of dentine. Here, they used mesoporous calcium-silicate nanoparticles (MCSN). The synthesized silver nanoparticles were then incorporated in the biomaterial by two methods including adsorption and template method. These biomaterials were then tested against E. faecalis in different forms (MCSN alone, AgNPs adsorbed MCSN, and AgNPs templated MCSN) to evaluate their antibacterial potential. Here, the results revealed that both surfaceadsorbed and surface-templated AgNPs-MCSN significantly inhibit the bacterial attachment and colonization of dentine. Further, as compared to adsorption AgNPs, templated AgNPs-MCSN were much lower in cytotoxicity and resulted in controlled release of Ag+ that can inhibit both planktonic and biofilm that can be effectively used for root canal disinfection (Fan et al. 2014).\nEmmanuel et al. (2015) used an eco-friendly approach for the systemic of AgNPs when the Justicia glauca leaf extract was used as reducing agent. The synthesized particles were in the range of 10–20 nm. These particles were then tested for their antimicrobial potential against S. mutans, S. aureus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The results here evaluated that AgNPs showed effective antimicrobial effect in a dose-dependent manner (Emmanuel et al. 2015).\nInbakandan et al. (2016) also synthesized flower-like silver nano-colloids using a green biosynthesized method. Here Haliclona exigua (marine sponge) extract was prepared used for the reduction of silver salt to AgNPs. These nanoparticles were then used against the oral biofilm-forming bacteria including S. orulis, S. salivarius,\n6 Antimicrobial Silver Nanoparticles: Future of Nanomaterials\n110\nand S. mitis. The results showed that even at 10 μg, concentration of AgNPs can effectively inhibit the growth of these test bacteria (Inbakandan et al. 2016).\nFurther, Fatemeh et al. (2017) performed a study to evaluate the effect of silver nanoparticles on the composite shear bond strength to the exposed dentine. Here firstly the AgNPs were prepared using sodium dodecyl-sulphate (SDS) that also act as capping agent for these particles. Further specimen preparation was done by using six different types of adhesive system and AgNPs. Here the results revealed that the AgNPs can improve the bonding effectiveness of Clearfil SE bonds on the wall of cavity. Further, it was evaluated that the bond strength of etch-and-rinse adhesive was effectively high as compared to self-etch (Clearfil SE bond) adhesive. So this study revealed the effective antibacterial potential in restorative dentistry and can increase the bond strength of adhesive system (Fatemeh et al. 2017)."

The objective of this advancement is there to fulfill the complete bactericidal potency of fabric that can be used in undergarments, sportswear, hospital clothing, work-wear, seat, and carpets of vehicles that can improve the quality of life by control of spreading microorganism from one person to other. Several studies are there with the use of silver nanoparticle-embedded fabric.\nPulit-Prociak et al. (2016) used silver nanoparticle-modified dye which can be used for dyeing cotton fabric that gives permanent antimicrobial property to fabric. Here firstly, dyes (indigo and yellow commercial dye) were prepared and AgNPs were reduced in situ with dye. The silver-modified dyes were then used for coloring the cotton fabric which was then assessed against S. cerevisiae strain to evaluate their antibacterial potential. Results indicated that these fabric showed efficient antibacterial potential along with UV-protection property (Pulit-Prociak et al. 2016).\nBallottin et al. (2017) synthesized silver nanoparticles from a biogenic method where Fusarium oxysporum fungal filtrate (FF) solution was used for the reduction of silver to AgNP1 and AgNP2. These AgNPs were impregnated on cotton fiber that can be used in medical and agricultural clothing to avoid the spread of microbes and severe infection. The antimicrobial potential of these fabricated cotton was evaluated against fungi (Candida albican, Candida parapsilosis) and bacteria Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri. The cytotoxicity study was evaluated against standard fibroblast cell line 3T3. The evaluated results showed that AgNP2 exhibit efficient effectiveness with MIC value lower as compared to AgNP1 due to high Ag+ release in case of AgNP2 (Ballottin et al. 2017).\nRecently, Li et al. in 2017 developed a method for preparation of cotton fabric with characteristic antimicrobial and UV-protection properties. In their study, they used hydrothermal deposition method for deposition of flower-like TiO2\nG. Arya et al.\n111\nmicro- particles onto the cotton fabric. The AgNPs were then in situ synthesized onto this TiO2@ cotton surface that was pretreated by sodium hydroxide solution. The AgNPs were deposited in different concentration to check their comparative concentration- dependent effect against bacteria (S. aureus and E. coli) and UV. The comparative study was done between AgNPs@ cotton, TiO2@ cotton, and Ag/ TiO2@ cotton. The results of in vitro assay revealed the good antibacterial efficacy of both AgNPs@ cotton and TiO2@ cotton, while the maximum antibacterial potential and high UV-protection factor of 56.39 was observed in Ag/TiO2@ cotton which was due to the synergistic behavior of both TiO2 and AgNPs (Li et al. 2017)."

Here the membrane was fabricated using chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol with 70 to 30 mass ratio, respectively. Further, the silver nanoparticles were decorated on the surface of membrane by in situ reduction of AgNO3. To evaluate the disinfectant potency, the membrane was assessed against E. coli that resulted in efficient reduction in bacterial growth and exhibit significant increase in both static and dynamic antibacterial filtration efficiency (Adibzadeh et al. 2014).\nQurban Ali et al. in 2017 fabricated multifunctional nanocomposite that is composed of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). These nanocomposites were then embedded with iron oxide and AgNPs. Due to antimicrobial potency of embedded AgNPs, this nanocomposite was used to treat the E. coli-infected drinking water (Ali et al. 2017).\nRecently, Elwakeel et al. in 2018 synthesized magnetic disinfectant through the polymerization of thiourea and formaldehyde in the presence of magnetite nanoparticles (MTUF). The obtained polymerized magnetic chelating resin was then impregnated with Ag ions. Further, to evaluate the antibacterial potential, the resultant MTUF-Ag was assessed against Gram-negative bacteria including E. coli, S. typhimurium, P. aeruginosa, and Gram-positive bacteria including Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, E. faecalis, and B. subtilis. The results of in vitro study revealed that the minimum inhibitory dosage (MID) after 40 min of treatment of MTF-Ag was 1.5, 2.0, 1.0, 1.5, and 1.5 mg/ml for E. coli, S. typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus, respectively, whereas the MID value 2.5  mg/ml in C. albicans revealed that the bacteria have resistance potential against this magnetic disinfectant (Elwakeel et al. 2018). All these studies revealed that the AgNPs can be successfully used as a good candidate for water disinfectant.\n6 Antimicrobial Silver Nanoparticles: Future of Nanomaterials\n112"

      "text" : "The resistance toward antibiotics among bacteria has now became a major concern in environment and public health. Further, emergence of superbacteria that are resistant to almost all antibiotics are worsening the situation. There are two aspects of occurrence of antibacterial resistance through mutation in their genome or acquisition of resistance gene by horizontal gene transfer (Hocquet et al. 2016). So, to combat with these conditions, silver nanoparticles were focused by researcher, but the expected risk of repeated intentional (as biocide) and unintentional (dispose-off of various commercial consumer products) use of these AgNPs can lead to major resistance problem. Although there are no clear reports on bacterial resistance toward AgNPs, there is presence of resistance reports toward Ag+ (von Wintersdorff et al. 2016).\nHachicho et  al. in 2014 presented a study where they evaluated the effect of AgNPs and Ag+ on the adaptive response mechanism and growth of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 (the best strain for stress response investigation). Their investigated results show that the Ag+ was about 1600 times more toxic than AgNPs and the activity of these AgNPs reduced with the decreased amount of silver ion release. Further, from the experiment they found that the P. putida mt-2 excluded the toxicity effect of AgNO3 and AgNPs. It was reported in the literature that the Pseudomonas strain have ability to modify the surface hydrophobicity of their cell envelope. So, here author suggested that it could be a reason of excluded toxic of AgNO3 and AgNPs (Hachicho et al. 2014).\nFurther in 2015, Graves et  al. performed a study where they utilized citratecoated AgNPs and AgNO3 against E. coli K-12 MG1655 (not known for any silver resistance element). In their experiment E. coli was exposed to AgNPs environment for a larger number of generation. The results of genomic analysis revealed that a total of three mutations were observed to occur after treatment of AgNPs up to 200 generations, which leads to high-frequency resistance toward these particles. Finally, the exposure of AgNPs upto 225 generations resulted in a complete resistance in the presence of 10 nm concentration of citrate-capped AgNPs and AgNO3 (Graves Jr et al. 2015).\nKaweeteerawat et  al. (2017) performed study of AgNPs resistant effect and mechanism against S. aureus and E. coli. Here the results showed, after treatment of AgNPs the bacteria showed 3–13 fold more resistance toward ampicillin and penstep. Further, in case of kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and penicillin, the MIC and MBC value increased up to eight fold. This occurred by lowering of both the membrane damage and oxidative stress. Further, it was observed that the repeated penetration of AgNPs resulted in promoting stress tolerance generated through ROS and free radicals (Kaweeteerawat et al. 2017).\nThese resistance issues can be resolved by the combinational use of silver with antibiotics where synergistic effect of antimicrobial agent reduces the chance of microbial resistance and occurs due to single mechanism of resistance (Graves et al. 2017).\nRecently, Panacek et  al. in 2018 have performed experiments against Gramnegative bacteria E. coli 013, P. aeruginosa CCM 3955, and E. coli CCM 3954 to\nG. Arya et al.\n113\nevaluate the mechanism behind the development of bacterial resistance toward AgNPs. Their results also revealed that the resistance of bacteria toward AgNPs can be developed by repeatedly exposing to inhibitory concentration. They also revealed the mechanism of bacterial resistance is due to the production of adhesive protein (flagellin) in the bacterial flagella which enhance aggregation. They also revealed that the problem can be resolved by inhibiting the flagellin production that will reduce the aggregation of particles toward flagella. Further their study revealed that the Pomegranate rind extract (PGRE) can be used against flagellin to inhibit production of flagella. This can minimize the existing challenges toward the use of silver nanoparticles against bacteria (Panáček et al. 2018)."

      "text" : "Regardless of the preparation methods, all fabricated AgNPs can exhibit their antimicrobial potential in a good manner. This potential further depends on the various physicochemical properties including size, shape, state, charge, concentration, and dose of the particles. The efficient antibacterial potential of these AgNPs can make it applicable in broad-spectrum area such as healthcare, medical devices, cosmetic, food and beverage packing, purification units, and sterilized coating materials. These particles are emerging as a powerful weapon against various multidrug resistance bacteria. Further, these particles efficiently show their potential toward biofilm- forming bacteria and reducing the bio-burden in healthcare and medical field. Nowadays, researchers are extensively trying to focus on these AgNPs for their antibacterial potential against superbacteria that is giving a hope to minimize the worsening of condition of present scenario. Despite all these spectacular benefits, there are emergence of new reports of antibacterial resistance toward Ag+ released through AgNPs which have been observed due to the intentional (as biocidal) and unintentional (other consumer products) exposure of these AgNPs toward bacteria in an extensively repeated manner. So, all these findings indicate that care should be taken with regard to the use of unintentional exposure of microbial communities to these AgNPs in waste products."

Some of them are beneficial and while other cause major sepsis, mortality and further, modernization is enhancing these challenging issues. Despite immense advancement in diagnosis and treatment, the microbial infections are acknowledged cause of chronic sepsis, morbidity, and mortality. Available reports showed that more than 3 billon people die due to microbial infection and their contamination in developing countries (Baranwal et al. 2018). The emergence of bacterial resistance toward antibiotics is becoming the major challenging conditions. This issue has led to the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) bacterial strain and superbacteria, which shows resistance to nearly all antibiotics. The reason behind this is the wide use and abuse of antibiotic which leads to evolutionary process in bacteria, both genetically and morphologically (Wang et al. 2017). The mechanism of resistance includes expression of efflux pumps, modification of cell components, and expression of some enzymes such as aminoglycosides. Further, a gene NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase) is a supergene that is responsible for broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance in superbacteria (Hsueh 2010). Apart from these, most bacterial species interact with each other to form microbial aggregates on a solid surface and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) which is secreted outside by these bacteria itself. These bacterial aggregates on EPS are specifically known as biofilm. These biofilms act as a protective covering for the bacteria in unfavorable environmental conditions and act as a barrier for antibiotics which inhibit their access to the bacteria that leads to continuous growth resulting in a mature biofilm. Further, these mature biofilm bacteria can invade the immune system by producing the superantigen within the biofilm.",
