      "text" : "Splitting water to produce hydrogen fuel using solar energy is one of the best solutions for a sustainable world although it remains a huge challenge on the inefficient conversion [1–3]. The low conversion efficiency is owing to the fact that most photocatalysts cannot offer active sites for photocatalytic HER, so a co-catalyst is necessary to modify the photocatalyst [4]. The noble metal Pt is known as the most efficient cocatalyst for photocatalytic HER although it has disadvantages of high cost and scarce reserve on the earth [5]. To replace Pt, lots of significant progress have been achieved recently for alternative non-precious HER co-catalysts that are based on transition metal compounds, among which the two-dimensional (2D) transition metal disulfides (TMDs) such as MoS2 stands out for its comparable catalytic activity to Pt while having low cost and high chemical stability [6–10]. MoS2 has three types of 2D structures, 1 T, 2H and 3R phases, respectively, among\nwhich the 1 T and 2H phases can have high catalytic activities for HER because of the exposed edges and distorted structures on the basal plane such as S vacancies and distorted Mo-S chemical bonds [11–13]. Previous research suggested that making smaller MoS2 particles to create more exposed edges or activating basal planes by making vacancies or changing phase could significantly improve the catalytic activity of MoS2 [14–17]. As the co-catalyst in photocatalytic HER, MoS2 nanosheets from few to monolayer, especially the nanosized monolayer in diameter of −20 nm, [18–20] were successfully fabricated with enhanced photocatalytic activity from 28 % to 76 % quantum efficiency at 420 nm when they were loaded onto the surface of photoharvester CdS nanoparticles, even far exceeded the hydrogen activity of Pt/CdS (−51 %) [21]. However, metal sulfides including CdS are chemically unstable because of photo-corrosion itself, which is therefore necessary to use chemically stable metal oxides as the photoharvester.\nAs one of the most representative stable metal oxide\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119387 Received 21 June 2020; Received in revised form 31 July 2020; Accepted 3 August 2020\n⁎ Corresponding author at: Photocatalytic Materials Group, International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute for Materials Science, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0044, Japan.\n⁎⁎ Corresponding authors.

As an alternative to Pt/TiO2, MoS2 loaded on TiO2 photocatalyst had been extensively studied in the past [22–24]. Similar to the photocatalyst MoS2/CdS, great efforts were made to create more exposed edges or change the phase of MoS2 to increase the photocatalytic HER activity. It was reported that the MoS2 nanosheets [25,26] or nanodots [27,28] was applied in MoS2/TiO2 photocatalyst with the activity around 2.0 mmol h−1 g−1. For the above purpose, exposing more edges of the MoS2 [29,30] or preparing 1 T-MoS2 [18,31] embedded on TiO2 can further increase the photocatalytic HER activity. However, most of these MoS2/TiO2 photocatalysts still show much lower photocatalytic HER activity than that of Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst for two main reasons: 1) the semiconducting 2H-MoS2 shows low HER activity; 2) the metallic 1 T-MoS2 nanosheet bigger than 20 nm cannot physically well match the surface of TiO2 particle such as P25 with rapid electron transfer [18]. In order to achieve not only the rapid electron transfer between MoS2 and TiO2 but also the high HER activity of MoS2, it is necessary to prepare ultra-small nanosized 1 T-MoS2 to have better interface bonding with TiO2, which still remains a challenge now. On the other hand, it is expected that the photocatalytic HER activity will be enhanced if the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are separated efficiently. It was reported recently that the fabrication of the photocatalysts such as MoS2/TiO2/Ti3C2 [32,33] or MoS2/TiO2/Bi2S3 [34] can dramatically enhance the photocatalytic HER activity. However, the roles of such fabrications are to enhance the photogenerated electron transfer between TiO2 and MoS2 to achieve the electron-hole separation. Considering the hole generation and accumulation will retard the electron-hole separation, it is necessary to integrate additional cocatalyst that capture the hole efficiently instead of TiO2 of low efficiency.\nIn this work, a nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer with only around 10 nm of diameter was successfully fabricated using a facile chemical exfoliated method. Benefiting from its ultrasmall size to get a superior interface bonding with TiO2, the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer has much higher photocatalytic HER activity than the nanosized 2H-MoS2 few-layers over P25 TiO2. When the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer along with a supporting co-catalyst NiOx was loaded onto TiO2, the photocatalytic HER activity of the dual co-catalyst MoS2/NiOx/TiO2 is almost close to Pt/TiO2."

Under the protection of Ar atmosphere, the temperature was first raised up to 80 °C and kept for 8 h to dry the water in the precursors. Subsequently, the temperature was increased to 350 °C with an increasing rate of 5 °Cmin−1 and kept for 4 h, and then cooled down to the room temperature naturally. 50.0 mg of the annealed precursor was added into 40.0mL DI water with stirring and then sonicated for 10 s. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5min to remove the precipitates. The supernatant was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 30min, then collected and washed by DI water and ethanol.

      "heading" : "3.1. Characterization of nanosized 1T-MoS2 monolayers",
      "text" : "It had been demonstrated to synthesize MoS2 and control its phases by employing lithium molten salts as the precursor at different calcination temperatures [18]. After the hydrolysis of the lithium thiomolybdate precursor followed by sonication, the precursor can decompose and exfoliate into 2H- or 1 T- phase MoS2 monolayer. The calcination temperature played a decisive factor in the phase formation of MoS2. It was set at 350 °C in this work with a similar preparation method of MoS2 monolayer as represented in Fig. S1a. Obviously, a black-brown suspension that might contain nanosized MoS2 can be obtained after the final dispersion in ethanol. Fig. 1a shows the HRTEM image of the assynthesized MoS2 monolayers with around 10 nm size. The characteristics of ultra-small size are due to the low annealing temperature at which the growth of MoS2 has a slow kinetic. The enlarged HRTEM image in Fig. 1b and its corresponding FFT image Fig. 1c indicate that there are hexagonal symmetry structures in two sets, which suggests the as-synthesized MoS2 is the 1 T-MoS2 phase. As a comparison, the MoS2 prepared under the same annealing temperature without LiOH assist (Fig. S1b), has a size around 10 nm within few layers (Fig. S2a) and has only one set of hexagonal symmetry structure (Fig. S2b and inset), which suggests this MoS2 is 2H-MoS2 phase. In Fig. 1d of the TEM image, a large amount of the exfoliated 1 T-MoS2 nanosheets were found and their thicknesses were estimated approximately 0.7 nm by the AFM image (Fig. 1e), which was close to the theoretical thickness of 1 T-MoS2 monolayer [36].\nThe phase composition of the synthesized nanosized MoS2 monolayer can be further determined by employing XPS, of which the emission spectra of Mo 3d and S 2p are shown in Fig. 1f and 1 g, respectively. In Fig. 1f, two main peaks locating at 231.7 and 228.5 eV correspond to the emission peaks of Mo4+ 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of the 1 TMoS2 monolayer, respectively [18]. However, both peaks are not symmetric, suggesting possible phase transformation from metastable 1 T-MoS2 into stable 2H-MoS2 under certain conditions [37]. To determine the compositions, a deconvolution was carried out to separate the emission peaks of 1 T-MoS2 and 2H-MoS2, in which, 231.7 and 228.5 eV are attributed to the emission peaks of Mo4+ 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of 1 T-MoS2 and 232.7 and 229.5 eV are attributed to the emission peaks of Mo4+ 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of 2H-MoS2 [38,39]. The peak ratio of 1 T-MoS2 and 2H-MoS2 in the XPS indicates a high percentage (≈ 70 %) of the 1 T-MoS2. In addition, a small peak locating at 235.8 eV is attributed to Mo6+ 3d3/2 due to the partial oxidation of unsaturated Mo of the nanosized 1 T monolayers. In Fig. 1g, it is seen that a strong peak locating at 161.8 eV and a small peak locating at 168.5 eV in S 2p region. Similar to the analysis for the XPS of Mo 3d, a deconvolution was carried out to separate the emission peaks of 1 T-MoS2 and 2H-MoS2, in which, 162.1 and 161.0 eV are attributed to the emission peaks of S2−\n2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of 1 T-MoS2 and 162.8 and 162.0 eV are attributed to the emission peaks of S2− 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of 2H-MoS2 [38,39]. Corresponding to the analysis of Mo 3d, the components consist of mainly 1 T-MoS2 but partially 2H-MoS2 determined from S 2p. The oxidized S was revealed from the emission peak at 168.5 eV, which is relative to the partial oxidation of unsaturated S of the nanosized 1 T monolayer. Therefore, the formation of the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer with partially transformation into 2H-MoS2 and oxidized MoS2 was confirmed. Without the assist of LiOH, the MoS2 can grow only as 2H\nphase. As shown in Fig. S3a and S3b of the XP spectra Mo 3d and S 2p, the peaks at 232.7 and 229.5 eV in Mo 3d and the peaks at 162.8 and 162.0 eV in S 2p are corresponding to the emission peaks of 2H-MoS2.\nThe UV–vis absorbance spectra in Fig. 1h illustrate the difference between the two as-prepared MoS2. While the 2H-MoS2 dispersion has the typical absorbance peak at around 400 nm, the 1 T-MoS2 dispersion absorbs light from 300 to 800 nm with a monotonic decrease of the absorbance with increasing wavelength, indicating the characteristics of a non-plasmonic metallic nanostructure. Due to the partial transformation of the 1 T-MoS2 into 2H-MoS2, there are inconspicuous characteristic absorbance modes A and B. The difference in the absorbance peaks is shown more clearly in the inset figure where the 2nd derivative of UV–vis spectra distinguishes the characteristic absorbance modes A and B. Additionally, Raman spectra can also precisely distinguish the MoS2. As shown in Fig. S4, two prominent peaks corresponding to the in-plane E12g and out-of-plane A1g modes of MoS2 are observed in both specimens. The 1 T-MoS2 has additional peaks J1, J2 and J3 in the lower frequency region, respectively, which are only active in 1 T-MoS2 but not allowed in 2H-MoS2. Considering the above analysis, the formation of the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayers with partial 2H-MoS2 was confirmed. Without the assist of LiOH, the nanosized 2H-MoS2 few-layers was formed."

      "text" : "The LSV was carried out to evaluate the electrocatalytic HER activity of the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayers and the nanosized 2HMoS2 few-layers along with Pt as a reference. Fig. 2a shows LSVs of the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayers, the nanosized 2H-MoS2 few-layers and Pt. It is clearly observed from Fig. 2b that the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer is a more efficient electrocatalyst for HER since the overpotential is reduced more compared with that of the 2H-MoS2 nanoparticles, although it is still not so efficient as that of Pt. The relative activities are further compared by the Tafel slope (Fig. 2c), in which the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayers, the nanosized 2H-MoS2 few-layers and Pt are 55, 101 and 31 mV∙dec−1. The activity is the best we obtained in our work so far by using the 1 T- or 2H- MoS2 monolayer or few-layers [18–20,23]. It is reasonable to have so high activity since the nanosized\n1 T-MoS2 monolayer can expose more active sites from the edges and the basal planes. In Fig. 2d, the long-term stability of the nanosized 1 TMoS2 monolayer in the acid solution was tested using repeated LSV under a scan rate of 50 mV∙s−1. It is observed that the nanosized 1 TMoS2 monolayer keeps the high activity even after the 1000th cycle. In short words, the as-synthesized nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer has significantly high HER electroactivity and chemical stability.\nSince the interface contact between planar MoS2 and spherical TiO2 is limited, it is unable to obtain extremely high photocatalytic HER activity for a relatively large-size 1 T-MoS2 monolayer on P25 TiO2 nanoparticles [18]. The closer interface contact can be realized using nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer. Fortunately, the ultra-small size of the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer in this work fulfills the requirement to get more interface contact over TiO2 and obtain higher photocatalytic HER activity. The TEM image of the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayers dispersed on P25 TiO2 is shown in Fig. 3a. It is observed from Fig. 3b that a close-contact interphase between the 1 T-MoS2 monolayer and TiO2 is formed. It is expected more contact area between the 1 T-MoS2 monolayer and TiO2 will facilitate the electron transfer through the interface, thus increasing the photocatalytic HER activity. The photocatalytic HER activity was then tested for the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer in methanol-containing aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. 3c, the photocatalytic HER activity of the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer can reach as high as 300.3 μmol h−1 with an AQE of 12.6 % at 365 nm, which is much higher than that of 48.2 μmol h−1 for the nanosized 2H-MoS2 few-layers and higher than the previous reported large-size 1 T-MoS2 sheet loading on TiO2 [18] as well as other MoS2/ TiO2 photocatalysts as shown in Table S1 [23,28,30,31]. The enhanced photocatalytic HER activity is mainly attributed to the intrinsic higher catalytic activity of 1 T-MoS2 and that the 1 T-MoS2 monolayer has more contact area with TiO2 interface, facilitating the effective electron transfer and electron-hole pair separation. However, as shown in Fig. 3d, the photocatalytic HER activity of the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer loading on TiO2 is still much less than 2196.8 μmol h−1 of Pt/TiO2 which corresponds to the AQE of 91 %. The potential reason for the much lower photocatalytic HER activity of 1 T-MoS2/TiO2 is the sluggish reaction of the photogenerated holes on the TiO2 surface. In the case of Pt/TiO2, the photogenerated holes can be captured by Pt\ninstead of TiO2 for methanol oxidation, [40–42] and get a high apparent quantum efficiency by efficiently separate photogenerated electrons and holes."

      "heading" : "3.3. Photocatalytic HER of the dual co-catalysts MoS2/TiO2/NiOx",
      "text" : "The photocatalytic methanol oxidation on Pt was revealed by carrying out photoelectrochemical methanol oxidation in methanol-containing Na2SO4 aqueous solution under dark and light condition for Pt/ P25 TiO2. As shown in Fig. 4a, under the dark condition, the potential of electrochemical oxidation of methanol is around 2.5 V for P25 but negatively shifts to around 2.3 V for Pt/P25. It implies that Pt can provide more active sites for the electrochemical oxidation of methanol. Under the light condition in Fig. 4b, the photocurrent starts to flow at a more negative potential, and the limit current is increased for Pt/P25 compared with P25. The increase of the limit current is caused by more separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes due to the ability of capturing the holes by Pt instead of TiO2. In fact, even without methanol, the photocurrent for Pt/P25 also starts at a more negative potential (Fig. S5), which reveals again the ability to capture the photogenerated holes by Pt. In addition, it is well known that Pt provides the active sites to capture the photogenerated electrons for HER. Therefore, due to the ability to capture photogenerated electrons and holes simultaneously by Pt, the Pt/P25 has excellent photocatalytic HER activity.\nWe had proved the as-synthesized nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer has a high HER activity, however, a relatively low photocatalytic HER activity over P25 compared with Pt/P25 in the methanol-containing solution. It is because of low activity to capture the holes for TiO2 to oxidize methanol. A strategy is to add other co-catalysts that can capture the holes into 1 T-MoS2/P25, so as to fabricate a dual co-catalysts composite that enhances the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes as shown in Fig. 4c. In general, Ni-based materials such as\nNiOx are considered as the good candidates for methanol oxidation over metal oxide such as TiO2 [35,43]. The NiOx nanoparticles are used here as one role of the dual co-catalysts. In Fig. 4d, the TEM image shows the size of the NiOx nanoparticles is around 10 nm and has close contact with TiO2 while dispersed. The LSV of the photocatalytic methanol oxidation for NiOx/P25 was carried out in 1.0 M NaOH + 0.1M MeOH aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. 4e, the limit current of methanol oxidation under light condition is in the order that Pt/P25>NiOx/ P25 > P25. It suggests that the NiOx/P25 enhances the photocatalytic methanol oxidation than P25.\nThe nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayers and the NiOx nanoparticles were mixed and dispersed to fabricate a dual co-catalyst over P25, as well as the nanosized 2H-MoS2 few-layers with the NiOx nanoparticles. The photocatalytic HER activities are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively, for the single co-catalyst and the dual co-catalyst that combines the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayers with the NiOx nanoparticles. As is observed, the dual co-catalyst has significantly enhanced photocatalytic HER activity than the single co-catalyst. The activity enhancement can be observed more directly from the inset figures. Obviously in the SI movies, the H2 gas bubble generated strongly in the case of dual cocatalysts. The H2 evolution rate of such dual co-catalysts can reach as high as 1629.1 μmol h−1 close to 2196.8 μmol h−1 of Pt over TiO2, which is significantly higher than that of 83.5 and 201.5 μmol h-1 for the single co-catalysts NiOx nanoparticle and nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer, and also much higher than the recently reported hybrid photocatalyst as shown in Table S1 [32,33,44]. For the nanosized 2HMoS2 few-layers as shown in Fig. S6, the photocatalytic HER activity also increases through the dual co-catalyst fabrication. The photocatalytic HER activity of the single co-catalyst and the dual co-catalysts using the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer and the nanosized 2H-MoS2 few-layers is summarized in Fig. S7.\nIt is expected to obtain higher HER activity if the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are separated rapidly and efficiently. In the recently\nreported hybrid photocatalysts MoS2/Ti3C2/TiO2 [33,44], the excellent electronic conductivity of Ti3C2 Mxene between MoS2 and TiO2 facilitates the electron transfer from TiO2 to MoS2, thus promotes the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, as well as in another case that use graphene as conductive mediate between MoS2 and TiO2 [45]. However, in the dual co-catalysts photocatalyst 1 T-MoS2/TiO2/ NiOx in this work, the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is promoted by not only the rapid electron transfer from TiO2 to the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 due to their strong interface contact, but also the fast capture of the hole by the NiOx. The schematic of using the dual cocatalysts to enhance photocatalytic HER activity is shown in Fig. 5c to e. For the single co-catalyst MoS2 monolayers, they can capture the photogenerated electrons and the residual photogenerated holes will accumulate to drive the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes (Fig. 5c). Similarly, single co-catalyst NiOx nanoparticle can capture the photogenerated holes, where the residual electrons will accumulate to drive the electron-hole recombination (Fig. 5d). However, in the dual co-catalysts, these two roles are successfully separated to carry on the MoS2 monolayers and the NiOx nanoparticle simultaneously (see Fig. 5e). Due to the fast electron and hole capture by the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayers and the NiOx nanoparticle, the residual electrons and holes keep in low concentrations, and then the recombination is reduced. Overall, the closer interface contacts between the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer and P25 along with the assistance of co-catalyst NiOx for the enhanced separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes, makes the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer in this work to obtain a superior photocatalytic HER activity that is close to Pt/ P25 photocatalyst."

      "text" : "The nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer with around 10 nm was successfully synthesized in this work by a facile lithium salt assisted chemical exfoliation method. It has an electrocatalytic HER activity with a\nlow overpotential of 78mV vs RHE at 10mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 55mV·decade−1, better than the nanosized 2H-MoS2 few-layers. The nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer has enhanced photocatalytic HER activity of about 300.3 μmol h-1 due to its more interface contacts with TiO2, but still lower than Pt/P25 with a photocatalytic HER activity of 2196.8 μmol h-1. A strategy of dual co-catalysts composite MoS2/TiO2/ NiOx combining the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer and the NiOx nanoparticles effectively enhance the photocatalytic HER activity to 1629.1 μmol h-1, which is close to Pt/P25. The fast capture of photogenerated electrons and holes in the dual co-catalysts make the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer performed closely to Pt on the photocatalytic HER. The effectiveness of the dual co-catalysts on enhancing the photocatalytic activity is expected to be applied further in other photocatalytic systems.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nHuiwen Lin: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft.

    "abstractText" : "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) of 1 T phase was found to potentially replace Pt as efficient co-catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, an ultrafine nano 1 T-MoS2 monolayer of around 10 nm was successfully synthesized and showed a high electrocatalytic HER activity with low overpotential of 78mV at 10mA cm. When the 1 T-MoS2 is loaded onto P25 TiO2, its ultrafine size dramatically promotes the superior interface bonding with TiO2 and a high photocatalytic HER activity of 300.3 μmol h is obtained. Furthermore, a strategy by introducing NiOx co-catalyst into the 1 T-MoS2/P25 to fabricate a dual co-catalyst composite 1 TMoS2/P25/NiOx significantly improves the photocatalytic HER activity to 1629.1 μmol h which is very close to Pt/P25 of 2196.8 μmol h. The close interface-bonding between the nanosized 1 T-MoS2 monolayer and P25 along with the assistance of NiOx results in the superior photocatalytic HER activity by the enhanced separation and transfer of the photogenerated electrons and holes.",
