Moreover, in field studies, it is difficult to compare the data obtained due to the lack of sampling protocols, standardized methodologies and techniques for the identification and quantification of microand nanoplastics, owing to the inherent physical characteristics of the these materials. Also, the definition of exposure limits is difficult due to the challenge of analytical methodologies. Therefore, this paper aims to characterize the existent analytical challenges in each step from isolation to quantification of nano- and microplastics and their consequences in the estimation of risks.\n© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

      "text" : "Microplastics are generally defined as plastic particles < 5 mm [1], although other size definitions have been proposed, such as <10 mm [2], 2e6 mm [3], <2 mm [4] and <1 mm [5]. These materials, believed to accumulate in the environment due to either their direct release or through the fragmentation of larger particles, have been subject to increasing scrutiny by the scientific community. Propelled by the current immediacy of global news and social media, both plastic- and microplastic-related contamination has garnered the interest of the general public, evidenced by the mounting news pertaining to these topics. Yet, despite the recent explosion of literature regarding the prevalence and effects of microplastics, particularly in marine settings, these risks have been identified since the 1970's. Carpenter and co-workers first reported the presence of microsized plastic particles in the environment and immediately identified their associated hazards and potential consequences, including the ingestion of these materials by numerous organisms, the adsorption of persistent organic\nUniversity of Aveiro, Campus\n.costa@gmail.com (J. Pinto da .pt (A. Paço), mfc@ufpe.br t (T. Rocha-Santos).\npollutants (POPs) found in the ambient water and the colonization of these particles by microorganisms [6]. These risks become even more evident when assessing the widespread distribution of these materials, which, geographically, is frequently updated based on the mounting scientific literature detailing the prevalence of these materials in the oceans. Such databases include, among others, the Global Microplastics Initiative, one of the largest global online microplastic pollution datasets to date, which has also been published elsewhere [7].\nRecently, in addition to microplastics, another class of plastic materials has raised concerns e nanoplastics. Such materials pose similar risks to those exhibited by microplastics, but these threats are exacerbated by the potential of being ingested by organisms that are at the basis of the food chain, such as planktonic organisms. Not only from an environmental perspective, but also from a public health one, it is perhaps even more worrisome that nanoplastics have been demonstrated to, once ingested, become distributed across different tissues and organs, as exemplified by the presence of latex nanoparticles accumulated in the testis, liver, blood, gills and intestine of Oryzias latipes [8]. However, of greater concern, these nanoparticles were also able to cross the blood-brain-barrier, a highly selective permeable barrier essential for the neuronal function and crucial for maintaining the necessary homeostasis and the protection of the brain from systemic toxins.\nIt becomes essential, therefore, to have an accurate depiction of the current prevalence of these materials in the different environmental compartments and how these interact with both the surroundings and biota. Alas, despite the increasing efforts in understanding the presence, fate and effects of microplastics in the environment, many uncertainties prevail, mostly due the inherent methodological and analytical challenges associated to the study of these plastics at environmentally relevant (low) concentrations [9]. Hence, in the following sections, the existent analytical challenges in each step from sampling to quantification of nano- and microplastics will be examined. Additionally, the potential significance of this quantification in the subsequent estimation of risks is also assessed.\n2. Defining micro- and nanoplastics: size does matter\nThere is a general consensus regarding the classification of microplastics as particles <5mm in size. For nanoplastics, however, the size definition remains somewhat a topic of debate. Similarly to engineered nanomaterials (ENM), nanoplastics have been defined as particles <100 nm in at least one dimension [10], as well as particles smaller than 1 mm [11]. Nonetheless, owing to the classification of nanoplastics proposed by the European Union, many researchers now consider the former definition [10]. Although it may be tempting to shrug off such debates as merely semantic discussions, these definitions have a profound impact in both research and implementation of regulatory instruments. Etymologically, the 1 mm cut-off size is coherent with particles that are, in fact, below the micrometer range and also result in narrower size ranges, as opposed to the use of the definition used for ENM (>100 nm - < 5 mm). In fact, this threshold may fail to accommodate the highly complex environmental interactions of these materials, as well as the ensuing biological and physiological implications for biota. As such, other authors have suggested to classify nanoplastics as plastic particles <20 nm, as this is the categorization used to classify plankton as nanoplankton [12]. Therefore, this may in fact be the size at which both nanoplastics and ENM become a heightened hazard to these organisms, which stand at the basis of numerous foodwebs. Nonetheless, for practical reasons, namely, the already implemented definition of ENM as particles <100 nm, recently published research has resorted to this classification. Of course, sampling is the initial step in any environmental assessment experiment, and, although there are pertinent aspects that still need to be addressed in studies focusing on the prevalence of micro- and nanoplastics in the environment, such as the lack of replicates and the use of methods that either eliminate or allow for the correct quantification of procedural contamination, the sampling process has been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere [13], and, as such, is not herein considered."

      "heading" : "3. Sample pre-treatment/microplastic extraction",
      "text" : "The versatility of plastics and their apparent endless range of applications render these materials, and, consequently, micro- and nanoplastics, highly ubiquitous. It is therefore not surprising that these materials have been found in freshwater systems, oceans, atmosphere, soils, and even in remote locations, such as polar waters and the seabed [14,15]. Hence, considering the number and differences of matrices, direct analysis of these materials is not possible and a pre-treatment process, prior to their analysis and characterization, is required. Not surprisingly, pre-treatment methods depend on the sampled matrix (i.e., soils or water, for example) and, owing to the fact that there is the need to develop methodologies enabling a high sample throughput, practicability becomes very important. Pre-treatment steps aim at removing\nnon-plastic materials, such as minerals and organic matter, while, simultaneously, extracting micro- and/or nanoplastics without inflicting damages on the particles to be analyzed. Concomitantly, it is also key that the chosen methods do not result in the accidental generation of additional micro- and nanoplastics, as is the casewith stress-inducing methodologies, such as ultrasound-assisted extraction. For both waters and marine sediments, the US's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has recommended the use of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a suitable method for the extraction of these particles [16]. Similarly, the use of H2O2 has also been recommended in an extensive guide prepared within the scope of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) [17], which also included the use of potassium hydroxide (KOH), a method tested by Dehaut and colleagues [18]. In their findings, the authors described that, comparatively to the use of KOH, extraction methods resorting to strong acids, such as nitric acid (HNO3) and used by some researchers, led to a significant degradation of some polymers, namely, polyamide (PA). The use of other strong acids and bases has also been described as viable digestion alternatives, including sodium hydroxide (NaOH) [19], hydrochloric (HCl) and sulfuric acids (H2SO4) [20], as well as enzymatic digestion procedures [21]. In spite of the high efficiency of the latter, evidenced by Cole and colleagues [21], such techniques are not susceptible to be used in high-throughput methodologies, owing to their inherent high costs. The use of sequential digestion protocols, based on the use of NaOH, followed by HNO3, has also been suggested [22]. However, notwithstanding the high recovery rate observed (>95%), the extracted polymers exhibited changes in weight, size, and color, although the authors described these as merely minor. Unfortunately, not all studies aiming at the detection and/or quantification and/or characterization of micro- and nanoplastics in the environment are accompanied by simultaneous quality control tests. Thus, a direct comparison of differently obtained data by different researchers resorting to either identical or different separation/ extraction procedures is impaired. In order words, absent tests detailing, for example, the recovery rate of the usedmethodologies, comparingmost of the data reported in themyriad of studies on the prevalence of micro- and nanoplastics in different matrices becomes futile. In Table 1, some of the most widely used separation/ extraction techniques are summarized. These are separated according to their physical (separation) and chemical (digestion/ extraction) nature and only references detailing recovery rates observed are included, except Mor et-Ferguson et al. [23], whom only reported the precision of the separation process.\nFrom the examples highlighted in Table 1, it is possible to extrapolate that the described methodologies, albeit different in nature, tend to exhibit relatively high recovery percentages (typically, >88%). Interestingly, one of the most recently developed technique (MPSS), has been shown to display high recovery rates, particularly when applied to sediment samples; however, the applicability of this method for the separation of real plastic particles found in marine sediments has been put into question, owing to the very low recovery noted for real particles, as opposed to artificially added representative particles [25]. Considering the densities of the most widely used plastics, such as high and low density polyethylene (HDPE, <0.970 g/cm3, and LDPE, <0.930 g/ cm3, respectively), polypropylene (PP, 0.946 g/cm3), polystyrene (PS, 1.02 g/cm3), expanded PP (EPP, 0.640 g/cm3) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 1.4 g/cm3), plastic particles may be separated from matrices composed of materials of higher densities, such as marine sediments (1.70e2.90 g/cm3), resorting to saturated salt solutions. Owing to its low cost and low ecological impact, concentrated solutions of NaCl (1.2 g/cm3) are often used, although denser polymers, such as PET or polyurethane (PUR, 1.25 g/cm3)\nmay not be isolated or become under-represented. Other salts have been used, such as NaI (1.8 g/cm3) [28], ZnCl2 (1.5 g/cm3) [27], lithium metatungstate (1.62 g/cm3) [32] or sodium polytungstate (1.4 g/cm3) [33]. The use of NaI has been noticeably accompanied by alternative density separation techniques, namely, elutriation, a process based on the use of a stream flowing in the opposite direction of sedimentation. This is a method that appears to be a suitable and cost-effective alternative, yielding good rates of recovery for polymers with densities as high as 1.4 g/cm3. Additionally, it is a versatile method that reduces the required volume for density separation, which is of significance, given the high costs of sodium iodide. Sodium polytungstate (Na6[H2W12O40]) has a very high solubility (maximum density of 3.1 g/cm3), thus making it highly suitable as a heavy liquid for separation. Compared to ZnCl2, highly toxic, sodium polytungstate is non-toxic, odorless, reusable and displays low viscosity. However, its high cost curtails its use in most laboratories and hinders the practicality in high-throughput analysis. Therefore, although all these high-density solutions are suitable for the separation of most consumer plastics, NaCl, due to the aforementioned advantages, is in fact recommended by NOAA in its manual of methods for analyses of microplastics from environmental samples [16]. Zinc chloride, though more effective in the separation of higher density plastics, should be reused for financial, but mostly, environmental reasons, and its recycling through pressure filtration has been highly recommended [34].\nFor extraction/digestion protocols, commonly used for isolating plastic particles from biota, but also for the removal of organic matter in sediments, although HNO3 is routinely used (e.g. Ref. [5]), it leads to significant degradation of the polymeric materials and, consequently, its use is not recommended. In fact, comparative studies [18] have led to results suggesting that the use of 10% KOH may be the best compromise for the extraction and subsequent characterization of plastic particles from biological samples. As KOH is mainly sold as a solid, depending on the degree of purity, a 10% KOH solution may correspond to a 1.5e1.8 M solution, and, therefore, future research should clarify this in their methodological section, as to meet the calls to provide standardized effective and cost-effective analytical methods by different international organizations [35].\nAlthough digestion methodologies are often applied in biological samples, they may also be used in samples isolated from sediments or aquatic samples, essentially as purification steps, obligatory stages for identification resorting to instrumental analyses, namely, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies, as well as pyrolysis-GC/MS [34]. Interestingly, for sediments, the use of hydrogen peroxide in a Fenton reaction has not only been recommended [16], but its comparative efficiency has also been confirmed [31]. Under such conditions, the use of H2O2 yielded not visible degradation effects, which may be due to its use at lower temperatures when compared with its use in isolation.\nLastly, but not less importantly, it is essential to ensure that the equipment used is free from plastic particles prior to sample processing, and, in cases in which this is not possible, samples should be processed randomly as to ensure the independence of the data collected and statistical validity. Background contamination, from both air systems and clothing, including lab coats [16], particularly when assessing contamination levels of microfibers. In fact, the simple use of a clean bench has been demonstrated to reduce microfiber contamination by up to 96.5% [36], thus suggesting that reports detailing pollution levels by microfibers may have been highly overestimated.\n4. Identification and characterization of micro(nano)plastics\n4.1. Visual identification/sorting\nFollowing the isolation of micro- and nanoplastics from the matrix from which these particles are samples, it is necessary to accurately quantify and characterized them. It is generally considered that, for microplastics, visual sorting is an essential, obligatory step. This process may be by naked eye or resorting to a dissecting microscope, a suitable strategy down to 500 mm [37]. However, multiple reports have detailed how putative microplastic particles were subsequently identified as naturally occurring fibers and materials [38], leading to the assertion that visual identification alone leads to either under- or overestimates of microplastic abundance. Therefore, although many results on the prevalence of\nmicroplastics rely on the combination of visual identification techniques with other methods (such as spectroscopic analyses), some rely solely in visual identification methods, which may not reflect the reality of the prevalence of these contaminants. In order to reduce subjectivity and human errors, some standardized protocols have been developed [39], including analyses by optical microscopy of particles only down to 1 mm. Nonetheless, visual identification remains a cheap, simple and relatively fast technique that presents the added benefit of potentially being carried out in situ."

      "text" : "Thermal degradation techniques, such as pyrolysis (pyr) or thermal extraction and desorption (TED), in conjunction with gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) are destructive techniques that allow for the identification of the polymer type (PP, PE, or other) of microplastics by analyzing their thermal degradation products [40]. Both Pyr-GC/MS and TED-GC/ MS have the advantage of eliminating any pre-treatment steps and allowing the identification of multiple particles in one step, as individual sorting is not required, demanding minimum amounts of sample (5e200 mg) [41]. It also permits the simultaneous identification of polymer-associated organic chemicals, as evidenced by the report by Fries et al., noting the presence of diethylhexyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, benzaldehyde, diisobutyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol in PE, PP, PS and PA marine microplastics [42]. However, these thermal degradation techniques do not allow the physical characterization of the analyzed samples, including number, color and size, but rather the masses of said samples. Moreover, although needing only minute amounts of sample, for pyr-GC/MS, particles do have to be manually placed into the pyrolysis tube. Due to the fact that samples can only be manipulated until a certain size limit, this inherently restricts the analysis of smaller particles and may compromise the representativeness of the sample, especially in complex matrices, as samples may not be homogeneous at a smaller scale. Because pyr-GC/MS is limited to low quantities, this hinders its application in the examination of large numbers of samples and it is therefore not suited for high throughput testing. Such limitations may be circumvented resorting to TED-GC/MS, which does allow the use of substantially higher sample masses (up to 200 times than in pyr-GC/MS) and comparatively fast analyses and mass quantification times [43], particularly for the most common types of polymers, PE, PP, PS, PA and PET. Again, however, the particle quantification and morphological characterization of isolated materials remains a severe limitation of this method, which has been validated solely for the aforementioned most common types of polymers, though not yet experimentally validated for other polymers, such as PVC, PUR or polycarbonate (PC)."

      "heading" : "4.3. Raman spectroscopy",
      "text" : "Raman spectroscopy is a non-destructive spectroscopic technique that allows to observe low-frequency modes in a system, such as rotational and vibrational interactions. It is a straightforward technique that provides a structural fingerprint that has been successfully applied in the identification of microplastic particles in different environmental matrices [24]. Because polymers exhibit characteristic Raman spectra, this approach enables the identification of suspected particles within minutes. Visually sorted particles may be readily analyzed and, when coupled with a microscope (Raman microscopy), particle of sizes < 1 mm may also be successfully identified [44]. Combining Raman microscopy with techniques such as Raman spectral imaging, it is possible to obtain\nimages with chemical spatial distribution, and, in theory, spectral analysis of whole membrane filters with high spatial resolution (below <1 mm), is possible [34]. This could simplify the detection and identification of smaller particles, but, currently, its applicability in micro- and nanoplastic research has not been demonstrated. Another potential combination is that of Raman spectroscopy with confocal microscopy, which may allow for the detection and identification of plastic particles in cells and tissues, with subcellular precision. Combinedwith atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman may also enable the identification of nanoplastics, operating AFM in both contact and non-contact mode [45]. However, it would be both difficult and time consuming to find and focus the AFM-Raman laser in a single nano-sized particle, and, as such, even if effectively demonstrated as a viable alternative for the identification of nanoplastics in environmental samples, it would not be feasible in the analysis of large numbers of samples. There are, nonetheless, some drawbacks in the application of Raman spectroscopy in the analysis of microplastics. For example, fluorescent samples (such as samples containing color pigments, additives or biomass, as algae) excited by the laser generate Raman spectra that are not interpretable [34], owing to the varying baseline that arises from this laser-induced fluorescence interference [37]. Therefore, samples for analysis through Raman spectroscopy are recommended to be subject to preceding purification steps, aiming at reducing fluorescence. Additionally, the use of Raman spectroscopy system parameters is not yet standardized, and many researchers tend to use their own, including the most commonly used laser wavelengths of 532 nm and 785 nm [45]. Higher wavelengths may result in decreased fluorescence artifacts, but the lower energy of the laser will result in lower signals of the plastic samples. Hence, a compromise is needed and, owing to the significantly higher times of analysis required for Raman spectroscopy examinations, a size division has been proposed by K€apler et al.: 1e50 mm (for a detailed, though more time-consuming analysis by Raman spectroscopy) and 50e500 mm (rapid and reliable analysis by FTIR imaging) [46]."

      "heading" : "4.4. Infrared spectroscopy",
      "text" : "Infrared spectroscopy, or, more precisely, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is similar to Raman spectroscopy, as it allows for the exact identification of polymers based on their IR spectra. In fact, Raman and FTIR spectroscopies may be viewed as complimentary techniques, as molecular vibrations that are IR inactive are Raman active, and vice-versa [34]. Simply put, Raman spectroscopy relies on light scattering, and IR in its absorption. As with Raman spectroscopy, the IR spectra generated for plastic materials are highly specific and exhibit distinct band patterns. FTIR spectroscopy can, additionally, provide supplementary information regarding the weathering of the plastic samples, effectively permitting an estimation of the degree of degradation or even biodegradation, based on the intensity of oxidation. This may be achieved, for example, by the determination of the carbonyl index, as the formation of carbonyl groups has been associated to the oxidation of, for example, PE [47]. Larger particles can be easily analyzed resorting to a surface variant of FTIR spectroscopy, known as attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR). Depending on the experimental conditions, each sample may be unequivocally identified in less than 1 min; nonetheless, sample is required to be isolated and, ideally, to be completely dry, as to avoid the IR signals from water. Regarding practicality, for relatively low numbers of samples, for example, <100 particles, FTIR-ATR analyses should be carried on all pre-sorted particles; conversely, for samples >100, it has been suggested that >50% should be identified as a representative sub-sample, totaling a minimum number of 100 particles\n[48]. By coupling microscopic imaging to FTIR, it is possible to collect IR signals at high spatial resolution, as the beam size may be as small as 5 mm, with resulting high potential for the detailed characterization of compositionally complex samples. In fact, literature surveys suggest that mFTIR-based identification of microplastics have become the prevailing experimental technique (e.g. Ref. [49]). Nonetheless, these approaches have to deal with increasing number of samples, each perhaps containing growing numbers of plastic particles, and, for each of these, a spectrum has to be generated, recorded, analyzed and stored. Hence, a promising extension of FTIR is focal plane array (FPA)-based mFTIR, which allows for high throughput analysis of total particles on a sample filter, without any operator bias or error, significantly decreasing time demands necessary for the interpretation of complex imaging data while simultaneously increasing data quality. However, the generated number of spectra and the necessary storage capacity may require highly potent and expensive hardware, as up to 1.8 million spectra may be generated from just a few datasets, as reported by Primpke and colleagues [50]. A simpler alternative may be fluorescent tagging followed by mFTIR identification using Nile Red, which has been demonstrated to result in decreased measuring effort [51]. Owing to the solvatochromic nature of Nile Red e i.e., the ability to change color due to a change in solvent polarity e it may be possible to thoroughly categorize polymers on the basis of the surface polarity characteristics of the identified particles. This strategy could be partially automated by coupling it to static image analysis, with concomitant reduced operator errors and biases, although this is yet to be validated.\nTable 2 summarizes some associated advantages and disadvantages of these commonly used techniques for the identification and characterization of plastic particles in environmental samples."

      "heading" : "4.5. Other techniques",
      "text" : "A technique recently suggested for the identification and characterization of suspensions containing monodisperse and polydisperse spherical and non-spherical polymeric particles is hyperspectral imaging [52]. Its subsequent use for characterizing microplastic litter has since been validated, and, for reference and real samples, this methodology has reportedly shown 100% and 84% pixel (particles) recognition down to 300 mm particles [53], demonstrating to be a non-destructive, non-invasive, cheap, fast and reliable technology with no requirement for sample preparation e though these required isolation. Hyperspectral imaging has also been proposed for the identification of microplastics in complex matrices, namely soils, by directly imaging the sampled soils with wavelength ranges between 400 and 1000 nm [54]. When resorting to a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for\nthe identification of the polymers, this technique identified PE particles in size ranges of 1e5mmwith a precision of 84%, and, for smaller particles (0.5e1 mm), precision was slightly lower (77%). Nevertheless, as noted for the authors, this method could only be directly applied in the determination of microplastics at the surface of the soils, precluding from quantification and identification any particles immediately underneath the surface. However, hyperspectral imaging has only been tested for the characterization of PE, PP and PS, and a detailed examination of all samples from any environmental compartment must account for all polymer types.\nDifferent polymers possess unique elemental composition, therefore allowing for the use of C:H:N analyzers in the identification of plastic particles. Mor et-Ferguson et al., for example, used this approach to assign different isolated plastic materials to a group of potential polymers [23]. In order to do this, these authors previously separated the collected particles according to their density, thus narrowing the search of the potential type of polymer [34]. This approach does not constitute a rigorous chemical analysis and does require significant time, thus not making it amenable to high throughput analysis. Additionally, it is not applicable to smaller particles, although it may be a useful approach in ascertaining the presence of microorganisms, as it may reveal the presence of nitrogen, which is not a component of synthetic polymers.\nSome works have detailed the use of spectrofluorometry for the quantification of microplastics [55]. Similarly to UVeVis spectrophotometry, this technique requires the use of standard independent colloidal suspensions and the measured fluorescence values are correlated to the corresponding nominal concentrations of suspended particles. Nonetheless, the use of spectrofluorometry as a quantitative analytical tool for the determination of microplastics in the environmental samples is not recommended, owing to its high sensitivity to numerous factors, such as pH or the presence of dissolved oxygen, which may severely affect reproducibility.\nThe analysis, identification and quantification of nanoplastics remains a challenging subject, as it is not sufficient to morphologically characterize these particles, but also to obtain a detailed chemical analysis at the nanoscale. Presently, there are still no established protocols for the detection and quantification of nanoplastics in real environmental samples and there are no reports describing the successful identification and characterization of plastics <100 nm in the environment [34,37], as these are not distinguishable from naturally-occurring nanoparticles. It is therefore essential to develop new methods for the accurate determination of these particles in environmental samples, and some methods may transition from other sciences, while new, fitfor-purpose methodologies, may be developed.\nand drawbacks are described.\nA frequently used technique for the characterization of engineered nanomaterials is electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS or SEM-EDS). It is themost widely used surface analytical technique and may achieve a spatial resolution better than 50 p.m. (5.0 10 5 mm) [56]. In addition to the low energy secondary electrons generated, backscattered electrons and X-rays are also formed by the electron bombardment on the sample. The intensity of these backscattered electrons can be linked to the atomic number of a specific element in the sampled area/volume, allowing a certain degree of qualitative information to be obtained. Hence, this versatile methodology has allowed not only to identify microplastics the aquatic samples, but also to sustain the assertion that UV radiation is pivotal in the embrittlement and subsequent breakdown of larger plastic debris into microplastics and to identify inorganic additives in microplastic particles [42]. However, there are some intrinsic limitations to this technique. Electron microscopes are expensive to acquire and maintain, and some require very stable buildings e often underground e and special conditions, such as magnetic field canceling structures. Additionally, despite the enhanced resolution that allows for very detailed observations, the use of electron microscopes reduces practicability, owing to the lengthy, extensive sample preparation and analysis, which also requires the samples to bemanipulated, an inherent added difficulty while ascertaining the presence of nanosized plastics in environmental samples.\nA recently proposed technique for the detection of nanoplastics in both aquatic and complex matrices, such as food, is asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation coupled to multi-angle light scattering, or AF4-MLS [57]. The fractionation step (AF4) allows for the separation of the synthetic polymers, while size is determined by MALS. Nonetheless, currently, this methodology still holds some limitations, including low recovery rates (~50% for 50 nm plastic particles [57]) and elevated light scattering background, which prevents the detection of, for example, PE, expected to be amongst the most ubiquitous nanoplastics in the environment [11]. Although still not optimized, the currently obtained recovery rates may be increased, by improving the separation conditions in the AF4 step. These may include pH and buffer concentration, which have a direct impact in the performance of this methodology. Nonetheless, these are presently mere suggestions, and such possibilities remain hypothetical."

      "text" : "The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines in its 31000 (2009) ISO Guide risk as the “effect of uncertainty on objectives”, in which uncertainties include events e that may or may not take place e and uncertainties by ambiguity or a lack of information [58]. These effects may be either positive or negative. Although plastics may be considered chemically inert, their presence in the environment may pose risks for both biota and, ultimately, humans. Nonetheless, it should be noted that their presence, i.e., contamination, is not a synonym of pollution, i.e., a biological and/or ecological response to said contamination. There is no dispute, however, that these materials e micro- and nanoplastics e are susceptible of being ingested by multiple organisms, ranging from zooplankton to large cetaceans [11]. These are often accompanied by a decreased in what may be described as “natural” feeding, such as algal feeding, as observed for the copepod Centropages typicus in the presence of polystyrene beads [44]. Other effects that have been directly attributed to the ingestion of these materials include lack of energy, reduced growth, development and fecundity, and, ultimately, survival. However, notwithstanding such evidences pointing to these severe impacts during chronic exposure to micro- and/or nanoplastics, they are not always observable,\nas noted for a number of organisms, including detritivorous (e.g., amphipods and isopods) [59] and suspension-feeding invertebrates (such as oysters and urchin) [60], which showed no impaired ingestion patterns when exposed to these materials.\nThe current use of sub-micron additives, most of which of low molecular weight and not chemically bound to the polymers, in an increasing number of thermoplastic applications, may result in the leaching of such compounds to the environment, as well as biota. Consequently, it is not surprising that virgin pellets have been shown higher toxic effects than beach-stranded particles, as measured by anomalous embryonic development in the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus [61]. However, plastic materials found in the environment may also adsorb chemical pollutants already present, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), organochlorine pesticides and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), thus constituting a(nother) source of exposure to organisms, particularly in aquatic environments [11]. Numerous studies have demonstrated this potentially detrimental occurrence, as a result of either a direct ormodulated response [62]. Most of these compounds are lipophilic in nature and, therefore, may more easily permeate cell membranes and, subsequently, potentially become involved in biochemical reactions that may lead to (cyto)toxic effects. As noted by Andrady [63], the risks that microplastics (and nanoplastics) pose to biota stem not only from their immediate physical consequences following their ingestion, including obstruction, increased energy expenditure (for egestion), false satiety and injuries, but also the leaching of contaminants, namely, additives, plasticizers and POPs. Such risks have been highlighted in numerous reports detailing observed behavioral, morphological and reproductive consequences of exposure of numerous organisms to these micro- and nanoplastics, and some of these studies are summarized in Table 3. However, these findings should be interpreted as “proof-of-concept”, meaning that the observed ecotoxicological effects, when observed, highlight the possibility of such phenomena, as the concentrations of plastic particles that far exceed those found in the environment and that are, therefore, of limited de facto environmental relevance.\nHence, the reported effects of micro- and nanoplastics, in isolation or in combination with other pollutants (Table 3) paint a dire picture and may be construed as rather alarming. Nonetheless, as previously noted, these results should be taken at face value. For example, Avio and colleagues observed cellular effects that included alterations of immunological responses, lysosomal compartment, peroxisomal proliferation, neurotoxic effects and the onset of genotoxicity, as well as alterations in gene expression profiles in organisms exposed to either PS or PE particles in conjunctionwith pyrene at 50mg L 1 [73]. However, as the authors note themselves, this is an extremely high concentration. Although possible, is not common and only occurs, for example, under very specific conditions, such as oil spills. For this PAH, 100%mortality of the common goby was observed after 96 h exposure to PE with pyrene at a concentration of 200 mg.L 1 [84], although the concentrations of microplastics were as high as 184mm L 1, values that are of little to no ecological relevance. Interestingly, microplastics seemed to delay pyrene-induced death in the P. microps juveniles, in spite of reducing isocitrate dehydrogenase activity, an enzyme involved in the citric acid cycle, an essential process in cellular energy production [85]. This may be due to the fact this hydrophobic compound is adsorbed by polymers such as PE, as demonstrated by Seidensticker and colleagues [86] for 19 different contaminants, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, at three different pH values (4, 7 and 10) and showed that sorption to plastic particles was considerably stronger for hydrophobic compounds and that neutral species, such as phenanthrene and DEET (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide), contribute to the\nJ.Pinto da Costa et al./ Trends in A nalyticalChem istry 111 (2019) 173 e 184\n179\noverall sorption. Additionally, these researchers were able to ascertain that partitioning was still the main sorption mechanism involved and that partition coefficients for polar compounds could only be accurately determined when solid-to-liquid rations were >6 orders of magnitude higher than any of the plastic concentrations reported in environmental samples. Therefore, the authors concluded, sorption of charged species in freshwaters is, given the current microplastic concentrations, irrelevant [86]. It should be noted, nonetheless, that these researchers used pristine particles and that the biological and environmental interactions may change the characteristics of the particles, including surface charge, texture and aggregation and that these factors were not accounted for in the described study. Additionally, the use of such pristine particles should also be carefully considered, as, often, these materials are sold with biocides, used to prevent bacterial growth, and/or dispersing agents, effectively rendering any toxicity studies with such materials useless, as any effects observed may be due to the presence of these agents.\nSimilar observations were made by Rehse and co-workers [87], whom demonstrated that the presence of polyamide (PA) microplastics reduced the acute effects of bisphenol A (BPA) on freshwater zooplankton (Daphnia magna). All tested concentrations of both BPA and PA far exceeded those detected and reported in aquatic environments, thus limiting the environmental relevance of the reported findings. By re-calculating previously published data, Koelmans et al. conclude that, overall, bioaccumulation of hydrophobic organic chemicals is mostly caused by the ingestion of natural prey, greatly overwhelming the flux from ingested microplastic [88]. It is also pointed out, nonetheless, that the effects of ingestion of these materials on bioaccumulation is, most likely, limited and, owing to the current lack of environmentally relevant, long-term studies assessing these effects, the analyzed field data is difficult to confirm and certainly “does not imply that plastics do not have deleterious effects on marine life” [88].\nIt is generally considered that the effects of a pollutant cascade through the different levels of biological hierarchy e subcellular, cellular, tissue and physiological e affecting individual fitness and, consequentially, populations of individuals, and, ultimately, ecosystems. The impacts in individuals constitute an indelible link to physiological and ecological processes, and do allow for a sensitive measurement of the responses to environmental pollutants and stressors. Therefore, observed impacts in groups of individuals may serve as warning signals and indicators of ecosystem-level effects. However, the inherent focus of these studies in sometimes reduced number of individuals renders the ecotoxicological impacts of the tested pollutants, to a certain extent, conjectural. Hence, the translation of sub-organism level impacts based on short-term data gathered using small groups of individuals into ecosystem-level impacts is immensely difficult.\nAnother risk that has been pointed out regarding the increasing prevalence of micro- and nanoplastics in the environment and, particularly, in the aquatic environment, is that these materials may constitute for invasive species [11]. Plastic particles may be colonized by numerous organisms, including tube worms, barnacles, mollusks and algae, thus increasing the probabilities of these organisms to reach new destinations. Such assertions are perhaps less controversial, as these risks have been demonstrated, for example, in the North Pacific, where plastic debris was found to contain invasive taxa from 11 phyla [89], including, noteworthy, the pathogen Halofolliculina spp., associated to the skeletal eroding disease that has affected Caribbean and Hawaiian corals. Furthermore, the colonization of plastic debris in the Ocean has been shown to take place by communities that greatly differ from the surrounding waters, which may have profound ecological impacts [90]. Remarkably, the bacteria found on the surface of\nthese plastic materials appeared to originate from non-marine environments and colonization varied according to the polymer type. Additionally, metabolic analyses results suggest adaptations of these bacteria to the plastic surface-colonization, namely, “cell motility” and enhanced “xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism” [91].\nUltimately, however, all the gathered evidence and subsequently perceived risk lead to speculations on the potential effects of these materials to human health. Although microplastics have been detected in commercial sea food and bottled water [92], nanoplastics appear to be more readily adsorbed and atmospheric pollution and ingestion of shellfish may constitute the major sources of contamination of plastic particles in humans [11]. However, the very limited data currently available suggests that toxicity caused by the presence of these materials in food is not likely, unless absorption of micro- and/or nanoplastics is not only high, but also continuous [92].\nThe recent surge of publications highlighting the potential deleterious effects of micro- and nanoplastics in the environment, and, possibly, their role in human health, have led to an increasing degree of concern among both researchers and the general public alike. Although this must be viewed as a positive outcome, some skepticism has emerged and suggests that the perceived risks of these materials in the environment may be vastly exaggerated and need to be more carefully evaluated. Off course, risk perception is highly subjective and, ultimately, personal. Hence, despite the need for implementing trans-national public health interventions aiming at curtailing the prevalence, and, ultimately, the effects of plastics in the environment, their implementation and effectiveness will be influenced by individual and collective risk perception and only accurate risk assessment protocols will definitively help to (in)form the basis of public health interventions."

      "heading" : "6. Future venues of research",
      "text" : "From the previous account, it is clear that there is some confusion and even unclear definitions in micro- and nanoplastic environmental research. Scientists use different approaches while assessing the presence of microplastics in different environmental matrices and, to this day, environmentally isolated nanoplastics remain elusive. As secondary microplastics are formed, owing to fragmentation of larger plastic particles [11], so are nanoplastics expected to be generated when, for example, microplastics are exposed to the elements and, in fact, laboratorial experiments support this still theoretical assertion [93]. Yet, although it is expected that environmental micro- and nanoplastics far exceed meso- and macroplastics by number, there are still no standardized established methodologies for accurately determining their presence and certainly to establish their ecotoxicological effects e or whether if these even exist as reported in the literature (see previous section). The development of portable methods for the extraction/isolation of microplastics from environmental matrices may actively contribute towards a better understanding of the prevalence of thesematerials. For example, Coppock and colleagues [27] developed a Sediment-Microplastic Isolation (SMI) unit based on the principle of density floatation, which showed high recovery rates (>95%). Although further field experiments and validation are required, it may point the way to true in situ observations. These may possibly be complemented by accurate determinations of the concentrations of these materials using, for example, particleimpact electrochemistry [94] or even FTIR-based techniques, such as FTIR-ATR portable equipment [95]. These, however, are presently not accessible to all researchers and, similarly to the findings using SMI, further field testing is required, as well as extensive inter- and intra-laboratorial validations.\nRegarding the identification and characterization of microplastics, spectroscopic-based strategies are the most widely used techniques and it is foreseeable that, in the near future, this will hold true. However, it is also evident that any used technique will have to deal with increasing number of samples and, therefore, automation e either partial or complete e is required. The use of FPA-mFTIR [50] is an interesting approach, but the predicted number of generated spectra would be unmanageable. Therefore, new tools and analytical strategies must be developed for the adequate characterization of these particles. Micro- and nanoelectronics, given their potential for miniaturization and coupling to, for example, automated samplers, may constitute valuable tools in the development of sensors fit for the analysis of plastics in numerous environmental compartments, and, potentially, for in situ analysis.\nMicro- and nanoplastics represent, therefore, not only new pollutants, but also potential new matrices and surfaces for other pollutants, microorganisms and organic matter to adsorb, absorb, interact and be transported [11]. The bioavailability of these only seldom renders them lethal for organisms (see Table 3), although chronic exposure do alter feeding, behavior, growth and reproductive patterns. However, these are often the result of exceedingly high concentrations, and, although the rationale for the use of such high concentrations may be obtaining measurable effects and to identify important modes of action, it may also lead to the manifestation of effects that are transient in natural settings. Tested concentrations should hence be environmentally relevant and studiesmust also focus on determining the underlyingmechanisms that are at the basis of these effects e when observed e which, presently, are still poorly understood. Additionally, these effects must also be benchmarked against any results observed due to the presence of naturally-present micro- and nanoparticles.\nFor nanoplastics, despite the existence of standardized protocols for the determination of the ecotoxicity of nanomaterials (e.g., ISO 20787:2017 [96]), it is important to understand which parallels can and cannot be drawn. Although the nature of the tested particles e engineered or the result of larger particles breaking downe should not imply differences in the methods for ascertaining their toxicity, micro- and nanoplastics presently cover a vast range of materials and characteristics, including in terms of size, differing in up to six orders of magnitude [97]. Consequently, it is possible that the similarities between ENM and nanoplastics may be valid only for smaller nanoplastics. Additionally, even standardized methodologies may yield results whose environmental validity may be limited, as the extrapolation of toxicological impacts on limited numbers of or groups of individuals, often in isolation and based on short-term exposures, challenges our current knowledge to identify, quantify and model relevant processes from a local to a global scale. It is therefore vital to assess the ecotoxicity of any material under, for example, long-term multispecies exposures, and mesocosms studies are important steps is establishing a link between the field and highly controlled laboratory experiments [98].\nThis perceived risk has led to growing concerns regarding the presence of both micro- and nanoplastics in food for human consumption [92,99] and the presence of the former has certainly been confirmed ([18,99]). However, there is currently no toxicity and toxicokinetic data for either micro- nor nanoplastics for human risk assessment, including the potential formation of nanoplastics in the human gastro-intestinal tract. Interestingly, although for commercial fish species it is generally considered that most of any potentially ingested micro- and nanoplastics during evisceration, it has been recently demonstrated that higher particles loads were actually present in the edible tissues [100], though confirmation is required. Hence, also from the food industry perspective, it is necessary to develop easily implementable methods to determine and quantify the presence of these materials in foodstuffs, while\nsimultaneously developing and enact appropriate quality assurance protocols. An increasingly evident and essential aspect of microand nanoplastic research is the current need to evaluate the generated data. In fact, although researchers commonly describe, in meticulous detail, the analytical processes used, information regarding the inspection and interpretation of measurement data is commonly absent. How the identification of the different materials is carried out, namely, through manual or automated databases, and, in this case, which algorithms are used, are details frequently omitted, and this information is of the utmost importance for the direct comparison of experimental data. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, there are still no available studies detailing intermethod and inter-laboratory data comparison, which is key in validating the currently used methods (and respective modifications) by different researchers and research groups.\nLastly, in a time where the maxim “publish or perish” still holds, the publication of negative results, while less impacting, certainly, from a PR perspective, should be highly encouraged, as only provided with a complete picture will scientists be able to reach significant conclusions on the (eco)toxic effects of these particles in individuals, groups, species, ecosystems and, ultimately, humans."

      "heading" : "7. Conclusions",
      "text" : "There has much that we have learned in the past few years regarding plastic pollution and their associated hazards. Yet, it pales in comparison to what there is still to learn, particularly regarding micro- and nanoplastics in the environment and their risks.\nFirst and foremost, it is necessary to develop and establish clear definitions and categorizations for plastic particles and perhaps the best way to achieve this goal is to have an interdisciplinary approach, led by international organizations that may lend not only credibility, but, most importantly, expertise e and, therefore, some degree of authoritye over which definitions to implement. There is also the need to research new analytical methods for the identification, characterization and quantification of micro- and nanoplastics in environmental matrices and detailed toxicity and toxicokinetic of these materials. These should be performed in realistic environmental concentrations and must consider not only short-term exposure of individuals or groups of individuals, but also long-term effects, if any, in multispecies and mesocoms studies. For this, it will be necessary to:\n1) Systematically characterize particles in studies of exposure, including intrinsic particle properties, agglomeration, heterand homoaggregation and sedimentation as well as (potential) leaching of constituent monomers and additives. 2) Develop analytical techniques for the accurate quantification of micro- and, more pressingly, nanoplastics, that minimize any change to the tested plastic particles during sample preparation and examination. 3) Create and continuously expand reference libraries, allowing for method validation and inter-method comparison. 4) Develop specific protocols for (eco)toxicity assessment, considering not only the physical and chemical characteristics of the tested samples, but also of the potentially leached compounds and absorved/adsorved pollutants, including POPs. 5) Evaluate how weathering and (bio)degradation processes affect the environmental distribution and effects of micro- and nanoplastics;\nFinally, in order to unambiguously establish micro- and nanoplastics as pollutants, it is essential to understand what are the fundamental underlying mechanisms associated with any potential biological effects of these materials. Only by definitively answering\nthis question will it be possible to safely replace these materials with alternatives that do not pose a threat to organisms and the environment."
