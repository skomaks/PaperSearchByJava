      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Over the last century nanotechnology branch is flourishing to a great extent. And today many types of research are directly or indirectly related to the nanotechnology. Nanotechnology can be stated as the developing, synthesizing, characterizing and application of materials and devices by modifying their size and shape in nanoscale” In each and every stream the prefix ‘‘nano” is using as a keyword even in advertising the products also. Actually the word ‘‘nano” is derived from the Greek word nanos or Latin word nanus means which ‘‘dwarf”. It is the combination of physics, chemistry, material science, solid state, and biosciences. So profound knowledge in one field will not be sufficient, the combined knowledge of physics, chemistry, material science, solid state, and biosciences is required. The applications of Nanotechnology\nare spreading in almost all the branches of science and technology. The difference between the nanoscience and nanotechnology is the nanoscience gives the knowledge about the arrangement of atoms and their basic properties at nanoscale whereas the nanotechnology is the technology used in governing the matter at the atomic level for the synthesis of the novel nanomaterials with different characteristics [1]. The nanotechnology getting attention in almost all engineering branches but the common people didn’t get the knowledge about its existence in daily life but its vast usage in the medicine, engineering, environment, electronics, defense, and security is still increasing (Fig. 1). Even though so much work was done using this technology but still have space for developing the new novel nanomaterials in various fields for the progress of mankind. The researchers are fascinated and working for the progress of knowledge in terms of their size, capability, and expenditure. So special interest on the miniaturization of the device with economical is focusing mainly in the field of medicine, electronics. In upcoming days the nanotechnology controls mankind in living, working and communicating fields. So this gives interest in this\naterials\nsubject and leads to the discussion of the basic and major topics of nanotechnology.\nThe basic and the key elements of nanotechnology are the ‘‘nanomaterials”. The nanomaterials are the materials with less than 100 nm size ones at least in one dimension. That means they have very less size than that of microscale. The nanomaterials are usually 10 9 m in size that means it is one billionth of a meter. The nanomaterials show different physicochemical properties than the bulk material which inherently depends on their size and shape. Surprisingly the nanomaterials produce a unique character with new characteristics and capabilities by modifying the shape and size at the nanoscale level. Nanomaterials may be of different shapes like nanorods, nanoparticles, nanosheets which can be characterized based on their dimensionality. Nanomaterials with zero-dimensional are nanoparticles, one dimensional is nanorods or nanotubes and two dimensional are generally films and layers type one. These are categorized mainly for the single isolated nanomaterials. By the interaction of two or more particles, their physical properties will alter. These particles of different constituents are called bulk or three-dimensional nanomaterials.\nBased on the dimensions of nanoscale (<100 nm) they are classified as follows.\n(1) Zero-dimensional nanomaterials (0-D): In this, all the three dimensions of the nanomaterials are in the nanoscale range. Nanoparticles will come into this classification. (2) One dimensional nanomaterial (1-D): In this, in any one dimension it will be in nanoscale range and remaining two dimensions are out of the nanoscale range. Nanorods or nanotubes or nanowires are related to this class. (3) Two-dimensional nanomaterials (2-D): Any two dimensions are in nanoscale range and remaining one dimension is out of it. These include nanofilms, nanolayers, and nanocoatings. (4) Three dimensional or bulk nanomaterials (3-D): In any dimension, these nanomaterials are not in nanoscale range. That means in three arbitrarily dimensions they are >100 nm scale. These include nanocomposites, core shells, multi nanolayers, bundles of nanowires, bundles of nanotubes [2].\nDimensionality\nType of Nanomaterial\nZero dimensional\nNanoparticles, quantum dots\nOne Dimensional\nNanorods, nanotubes, nanowires\nTwo dimensional\nNanofilms, nanolayers.\nThree dimensional or\nBulk nanomaterials\nCore shells, a bundle of nanowires, a bundle of nanotubes.\nThe nanomaterials are of different types based on their morphology, size, properties and the constituent in it. They are carbon-based nanomaterials, metal nanoparticles, semiconductor nanomaterials, polymeric nanomaterials, lipid-based nanomaterials."

Basically, the CNTs are embedded with graphene sheets which are rolled into a tube. These are much stronger than steel and can be useful for structural enhancement. The CNTs are of a singlewalled type and multi-walled type.\nFullerenes are the hollow cage structure particles with sixty or more carbon atoms. These are allotropes of carbon. Its structure similar to hollow football with pentagonal and hexagonal carbon units is organized in a regular pattern. They show good electrical conductivity, electron affinity, and high strength [1,2]."

There are different methods for the preparation of metal nanoparticles like chemical or photochemical methods. By using reducing agents the metal ions are reduced to the metal nanoparticles. These have a high surface area and have the good adsorption ability of small molecules. They are widely used in different research areas, environmental and bioimaging studies. Not only a single nanoparticle but also the mixing of two or more nanoparticles with the size control can also be achieved. By doping different metals even the rare earth metals can change the main element characteristics. By doping different elements in different constitutions their properties also get vary [3–6]."

These are widely used in photocatalysis, electronic devices. For instance, ZnS [7], ZnO [8], CdS [9], CdSe [10], CdTe [11] are related to group II-VI semiconductor materials. GaN [12], GaP [13], InP [14], InAs [14] are from group III-V. In recent times, semiconductor grapheme nanocomposites attracted the researches. The graphene can improve the physical and chemical properties of the semiconductor. For gas sensing sensitivity [15–17], piezoelectric properties [18,19] graphene composites materials can be utilized."

      "text" : "The nanocomposite is a polyphase solid material where one of the phases has one, two or three dimensions of less than 100 nm. Nanocomposites have a high surface to volume ratio which differs from typical composites. Based on the size and the shape the physicochemical properties may differ as follows [2,20].\nSize\nActivity\n<5nm\nCatalytic activity\n<20 nm\nChanging the hard magnetic material to soft\n<50 nm\nTo change the refractive index\n<100 nm\nFor achieving superparamagnetism\nThere are different types of nanocomposites like that of nanomaterials. The different types are Ceramic Matrix Nanocomposites (CMNC), Metal Matrix Nanocomposites (MMNC) and Polymer Matrix Nanocomposites (PMNC).\nIn them, the polymer composite of graphene-based composites is developing in recent days to a large extent. Graphene is composed of carbon moiety. The single layer carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal matrix [21,22]. It exists with zero band gap and the electrons are almost as the massless particles which consist of the good electrical medium in 2D [23]. The precursor of graphene is graphene oxide (GO) whose electronic conductivity [24] is very less. So the conversion of GO to reduced graphene oxide rGO gives better results with good conductivity. There are different methods like Exfoliation method [25–27], CVD method [28,29], thermal reduction [30,31], chemical reduction [32–34], multistep reduction method [35–38] to convert the GO to rGO. The different types of semiconductor graphene family nanocomposites are a metal oxide/grapheme nanocomposites, metal chalcogenide/grapheme nanocomposites. The metal oxides possess a variety of applications. In them ZnO [39,40], In2O3 [41], TiO2 [42], MnO2 [43], Fe2O3 [44] shows the photocatalytic, photovoltaic, drug delivery [45], gas sensors [46,47], batteries [48,49] and cytotoxicity activities [50]. The basic key role for these applications is the interaction of matter with surroundings."

      "heading" : "1.5. Different properties of the nanomaterials",
      "text" : "The nanomaterials with in the critical size (<100 nm) show unique and fascinating properties led to an interest in them. These properties of nanomaterials are different from the bulk material. While the macro-structured properties are identical to their bulk. On decreasing the particle size the number of particles on the surface increases. The coordination number for surface atoms is less than the inner atoms and so they mobile easily. Based on the surface property we can apply the nanomaterials in various fields like catalysis, functional coatings, adsorbents, nanoelectronics, sensors.\nThe excitation, emission, chemical reactivity, and stability properties are also size-dependent properties at nano-regime. Not only had the size the shape also played an important role in judging the nanomaterial property. When the nanoparticle size is nearer to the de Broglie wavelength limit and diameter is less than the quasiparticle interaction then they exhibit quantum size effects. The controlling and manipulation of nanomaterials properties is possible by controlling their size during their synthesis by using different methods. Due to having more surface area they can be applied as catalysts. Mostly the metal nanoparticles can be utilized as good catalysts. By using the surface phenomenon the nanomaterials can be applied in the following fields [1].\nElectronic property of a metal is based on their electronic band structure. The band structure depends upon the particle size. The delocalized bands are seen in the molecular states. The band structure of nanocrystal is in between the discrete states of atoms (and molecules) and continuous bands of crystals. The adjacent lines energy separation depends on the size of the particle. On decreasing the size the separation of energy levels increases. The metallic character decreases and gradually changes to the semiconductor nature.\nThere are different types of magnetic materials like dia, para, Ferro, antiferro, ferromagnetic materials. The soft and hard magnetic materials are different types of magnetic materials based on their coercivity. The soft materials have low coercivity with small hysteresis area and these materials can be magnetized by a low magnetic field. The hard magnets are contrasted to this. The coercivity will change based on the particle size. Generally on increasing the surface area and decrease in grain size the coercivity and saturation magnetization increases. So the nanoparticles have the more surface area with less grain size and show high magnetic strength. If further, the particle size decreased then the ferromagnetic particles changes to paramagnetic materials due to instability. These paramagnetic materials behave in a different way from the bulk material and so they called as superparamagnetic. The magnetic materials can be applicable in data storage capacity, electronic circuits, actuators, transformers, power generators and many more.\nThe nanomaterials show novel optical properties. The interaction of the material with light is known as the optical property which depends on the size, shape, doping, surface characteristics, and also on the surrounding environment interaction. This property is due to the due to their surface plasmon and quantum confinement of electrons. Free electron density and the dielectric medium of the nanomaterial will judge the surface plasmon resonance energy. Gold particle exhibits the surface plasmon resonance band at 520 nm, for silver, it is at 410 nm. The size-dependent Optical properties depend upon the size. For instance, a 2.3 nm size CdSe emits blue light whereas the 5.5 nm size CdSe emits red light. Based on the optical properties the nanomaterials can use in polymers to increase their refractive index. In LCD’s and LED’s, better resolution images can develop. They can applicable for optoelectronic materials. All the properties mainly depend on the size and shape of nanomaterials. So the controlling and manipulation of nanomaterials properties is possible by controlling their size during their synthesis by using different methods [51]."

In in vitro conditions, the core diameter of 20–45 nm homogeneous particles may be produced [55–57]. In\nspite of all this, in medical applications magnetosomes shows good magnetic properties may be as hyperthermia [58,59].\nBy using the photosynthetic bacteria like Rhodopseudomonas capsulata He et al. prepared 10–20 nm size gold nanoparticles extracellularly. The bacterial enzyme Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Hydride (NADH)-dependent reductase plays a major role in the reduction of gold ions to gold nanoparticles. They observed that pH in the growth medium controls the shape and morphology of the nanoparticles [60].

They produce unique and sophisticated nanostructures by using the biological templates like DNA and proteins. Biosensors [64], bioNEMS, bioelectronics systems [65] can be designed through this nanoparticles. Proteins are the main constituent elements for nanocomposite materials. For instance, in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the intracellular iron – storage protein is Ferritin. It stores in the form of iron oxide and releases it in a controlled fashion. In humans, it acts as a buffer and controls at the iron deficiency and iron overload conditions. It has a protein shell in which the iron oxide core is embedded in it. To obtain apoferritin the core with iron oxide can be selectively dissolved without damaging the surrounded protein. In the empty core of Apoferritin again iron oxide or any other desired nanoparticle can be filled. Now the protein with inorganic nanocomposite is obtained. In horse spleen ferritin, Fan et al synthesized the gold nanoparticles [66]. Yttrium phosphate radionuclide nanoparticle was prepared inside the apoferritin by Wu et al and conjugated with biotin [67]. The DNA templates are also useful in assembling the nanoparticles. Plasmids are the closed circular DNA molecules which are found in various bacterial species. 5–10 nm CdS DNA nanoparticle conjugate can be synthesized by the spin coating of the mixture of cadmium perchlorate and plasmid DNA."

The main disadvantage of this method is the toughness of getting the desired particle size and shape [74]. When compared to regular particles of the same size the deviation of magnetic characteristics of the prepared samples by milling process is observed due to the defects of lattice parameters which were developed due to the milling process [75]. In the ‘‘bottom-up” method either liquid or gaseous phase, nanoparticles are condensed in which the larger materials are formed by the chemical combination of the smaller ions."

Hyeon et al prepared the iron oxide nanoparticles by thermal decomposition method [110]. Park et al prepared 13 nm size monodispersed nanoparticles [111]. In biomedicine for the treatment of cancer, the monodispersed nanoparticles are the convenient ones. Kelly et al proposed that for the preparation of monodispersed nanoparticles by thermal decomposition, coordination compounds and metallocenes are the best precursors [112,113]. Before conducting the thermal decomposition the coordination compounds want to subject to the stabilizing agents and capping agents. By changing stabilizing agents and capping agents or changing the concentration of precursors or the solvents or the time of the reaction the size and morphology alters. Sometimes the stabilizing agent itself acts as a capping agent also. For instance, by using lithium azide, LiN3 small lithium particles can be made. In an evacuated quartz tube the material is placed and heated to 400 C. The LiN3 decomposes around 370 C and releasing N2 gas. After a few minutes, all the N2 gas has been removed in which the pressure drops. The left out lithium atoms combine to form the metal colloidal particles.

      "heading" : "2.3.1. Co-precipitation method",
      "text" : "This is the simple and common method and widely used for the preparation of a variety of nanoparticles. This method requires the aqueous medium for precipitation. The uniform nanoparticles can be achieved by using this process [80–86]. R5. In a short, the coprecipitation method involves the mixing of two or more watersoluble salts of generally divalent and trivalent metal ions. In them mostly the trivalent metal ions contain the soluble salts. These water-soluble salts undergo reaction and get reduced to form finally at least one water-insoluble salt which gets precipitated. The solution needsto be stir continuously which may or may not follow the heat conditions subject to the reaction conditions and also on the reducing agent [87–89]. Usually, by using this method, the particles show less crystalline nature. Heat energy can be applied to boost up the degree of crystallinity into the particles [90]. The whole process is maintained in the alkaline medium by adding common reducing agents like ammonia solution, sodium hydroxide and many more for maintaining the required pH. Size of the nanoparticles depends upon several factors viz., the ratio of a salt selected, pH of the solution, temperature of reaction medium maintained and type of the base used\nThrough filtration or centrifugation, the solvent can be separated out and further purified and dried. By doping different rare earth metals into the ferrites, doped ferrites can also be prepared. In biomedical applications, the usage of very small size nanoparticles is needed. So by using this method the biocompatible nanoparticles can also be prepared. For the formation of nanoparticles this method involves by the following processes nucleation, growth, coarsening (Ostwald ripening), agglomeration and stabilizing processes. In them, the nucleation and growth are the main steps.\nNucleation is the process of occurrence of smallest elementary particles of the new thermodynamic phase. The main factor for the nucleation process is the degree of supersaturation. In supersaturation state, the solution contains dissolved materials in more concentration than the solvent could be dissolved. So the solute exceeds the equilibrium solubility. In the growth process to reduce the surface energy of smaller particles the larger particles will consume them. This process is known as coarsening or Ostwald ripening. To decrease the surface energy agglomeration may also occur. Without controlling the coarsening and agglomeration the particles may continue to grow beyond the nanorange. Some capping or stabilizing agents are helpful to cease the growth of nanomaterials. The capping agents bind to the nanoparticle surface through chemisorption of charged species and produce the electrostatic (vander Waals) repulsion on its surface. If the repulsive forces are strong then the stable nanoparticles will form or else the coagulation will occur [1]. There isa number of reducing agents such as hydrogen (H2), metal borohydride (NaBH4, LiBH4), hydrazine hydrate (N2H4 H2O) and hydrazine dichloride (N2H4 2HCl).\nThe reduction reaction will be as follows:\nMnþ þ ne ! M0 Mnþ is ametal\nSimultaneously oxidation reaction also occurs which can be depicted as follows,\nXm ne ! Xm n Xm is reducing agentð Þ The whole reaction occurs in the liquid state but the final compound collected in the solid state. So this process also called reactive crystallization."

In this method first, the metal alkoxide solution undergoes hydrolysis with water or alcohols in presence of acid or base followed by polycondensation. Due to polycondensation, the liquid phase was changed into the gel phase by the removal of the water molecules in the solution and also the increases the viscosity of the solution. After all the water molecules were condensed then the gel phase changes into the powder phase (Fig. 2). Some additional heat is required to get the fine crystalline nature to the powder [91–95].\nThis method was useful for the preparation of oxides, composites, and hybrids of organic and inorganic ones. The basis of the sol–gel method is inorganic polymerization reactions. The main advantage of this method is its simple procedure. But the purity is less in this method due to the formation of composites in it. So post-treatment is required for the purification of the sample."

The main advantage of this method is the preparation\nof good quality crystals with controlling the composition. In 1:2 mol ratios the divalent and trivalent transition metal salts are mixed together [96–100]. To get the homogeneous solution mix the organic solvent with constant stirring to the above solution. Then the solutions are brought into the sealed vessel or commonly called autoclave (bomb). By heating, the autogenous increase of pressure takes place which will directly raise the solvents above their boiling points. The temperature adjustment and time are dependent on the type of the nanoparticle to be synthesized [101]. This is a good method for the preparation of the least size nanoparticles which can be applied in the biological field. Copper ferrites, a typical magnetic nanoparticle were synthesized by using the hydrothermal method and its cytotoxic nature was observed by MTT test. Their cellular response in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) was observed [102]. By the selection of suitable solvents and also by varying factors like temperature, pressure, pH, aging time, the concentration of reactants and time of the reaction the controlled and desired size, morphology and surface chemistry of nanoparticles will be produced. Highly homogeneous nanoparticles can be achieved by using this technique. Without postannealing treatments development of the least size nanoparticles, in the desired crystalline phase at relatively lower temperatures is possible in this method. This attracted so many researchers than the traditional methods.

The frequencies range of 1 and 2.5 GHz is using and so 100–200 C temperature will develop. It requires a shorter reaction time so that the more time taking reactions can be completed in a few minutes [115,116]. Using this method narrow size distributed small size particles can be prepared. Colloidal metals, ferrites, oxides, selenides [117] are prepared by using this method. The improved mode of the microwave synthesis is microwave polyol process which was developed by Fievet, al.

The surface morphology can be done by using the AFM, TEM, and FESEM. The images obtained by using these techniques will give an idea about the shape of nanoparticles of which whether they are in spherical shape or rod shape or with pores. The diameter of the nanoparticles can also calculate. On comparison with SEM, TEM will give information regarding the compositional, morphological and crystallinity of nanoparticles. In SEM a beam of electrons interact with atoms of the sample and they produce various signals. These signals will provide information about surface topography and composition of the sample. So at least the surface of the samples should be electrically conductive. In the case of nonconductive samples, the surface coating must be done with ultrathin electrically conducting material. AFM will also do the same job as SEM and TEM but it works for only dry samples. HRTEM, FESEM, XRD are mainly used for size calculation of nanoparticles. When compared with light microscopes TEM can capture the image at high resolution. So detailed and clear information of nanoparticles will be achieved. The orientation of the crystal, aggregation state, electron structure, lattice spacing, and electron phase shift can also be achieved by using the TEM instrument. The determination of the size of the nanoparticle can be done easily by using the TEM [118,119]. In them by using XRD spectroscopy size determination can be done by using Scherrer equation. The sharp XRD peaks are convenient for the determination of the size of nanoparticles. But in case of non-crystalline nanoparticles, the XRD peaks are broad and not easy to determine the size than TEM. By using XRD the very small nanoparticles size can also be not determined. Photon correlation spectroscopy, Mossbauer spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS) are useful for the calculation of mean particle size and size distribution. Brunauer Emmet Teller (BET) method is useful to determine the surface area of nanoparticles."

For this application of releasing the drug at the targeted site through the blood circulation, the nanoparticle must be in the least size (Cobabeeg 2003). The nanoparticles will release the drug at the targeted site under stimulation. There are different types of stimuli like physical–chemical, biological, temperature and electricity. Based on these stimuli the drug will be released. For drug delivering and targeting mainly gold, titanium, magnetic nanoparticles or quantum dots are used. When these nanoparticles are combined with polymers good and improved output will observe. Among all the nanoparticles the gold nanoparticles are the most efficient ones in drug targeting. The optical properties of gold nanoparticles unique and plays an important role in cancer photothermal therapy and diagnosis [129]. Gold [130], silver [131] and magnetic nanoparticles [132] are acts as good nanocarriers too. The nanocarriers are constructed for the delivery of anticancer medicines to the targeted site [133–136].\nNanoparticles have high penetration character and show less disturbance to the normal healthy tissues. So the normal cells will be protected. The Silver nanoparticles also play an important role\nin Drug Delivery action. These nanoparticles have various types like Fe, Ni,Co and their oxides in which some of them all doped with the rare Earth elements. They can form the cluster also due to magnetic attractions of the dipole–dipole interactions. The magnetic core–shell nanoparticles are also frequently using and the organic or inorganic coatings are also using. Another class called QDs nanoparticles are useful for tumor targeting agents. QDs have electrical properties and used as imaging agents [137]. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles have high uses in diagnosis and therapy [138].
