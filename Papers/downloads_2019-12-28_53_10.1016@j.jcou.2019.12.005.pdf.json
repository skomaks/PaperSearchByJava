      "text" : "As climate change caused by the elevated CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is one of the biggest challenges facing the world, carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) has received significant attention [1]. In particular, CO2 conversion technologies have come into limelight lately as difficulties and concerns surfaced with the geological storage of CO2 [2,3]. Through CO2 conversion technologies, CO2 can be converted into chemicals which can potentially generate extra revenues for industry. Among them, mineral carbonation produces mineral carbonates (e.g. CaCO3 and MgCO3) and silica by reacting CO2 with magnesium- and calcium-containing silicate minerals (e.g. CaSiO3 and MgSiO3) [4–11]. This is considered an attractive option because it can store CO2 for a long period in a stable, inert, and solid form [12,13]. In addition, the risk of CO2 leakage is very low due to the stability of the mineral carbonates [13].\nA popular target product for CO2 mineralization has been calcium carbonate, as it is widely used in industries (paper manufacturing, filler in paints, plastics, and rubber industry) [14,15]. The traditional calcium carbonate production method utilizes limestone (CaCO3) as the source of calcium [8,9,16,17]. First, the limestone is calcined to calcium oxide, which is slaked with water to produce calcium hydroxide. Then, the calcium hydroxide is reacted with gaseous CO2 to produce\ncalcium carbonate. However, during the calcination reaction, a significant amount of CO2 is released to the atmosphere. To overcome this disadvantage, technologies that utilize industrial solid wastes containing calcium, such as steel slag, have been developed as an alternative mineral carbonation process [18–22]. Steel slag, which is a mixture of metal oxide and silicon-based compounds, is obtained as a by-product of the steel-making process [23]. Given the high volume of steel slag generated, it is an abundantly available source for calcium for the carbonation reaction. [6].\nA new process recently proposed by researchers at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) produces calcium carbonate by using steel slag [19]. The process named the KIST process not only utilizes steel slag as a feedstock of calcium but also exploits pH differences to increase metal ion extraction efficiency and selectivity. In the carbonation processes, acids are used to extract mineral ions from the steel slag, while bases are used to create a favorable condition for the carbonation reaction. In this proposed method, an electrolysis system which is modified from the chlor-alkali electrolysis process is developed to produce both the acid (HCl) and the base (NaOH) [24–26]. On the other hand, the electrolysis system requires a large amount of electricity and incurs a high capital cost due to the high price of the electrolysis cell [26]. Therefore, it is important to undertake a quantitative investigation to estimate the techno-economic feasibility and the CO2\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcou.2019.12.005 Received 14 June 2019; Received in revised form 27 November 2019; Accepted 5 December 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author.

Therefore, this study (1) develops a detailed model for the KIST process to get the mass balance and heat balance data needed for the analyses, (2) conducts a CO2 lifecycle assessment (LCA) to estimate the CO2 emission reduction (3) conducts a techno-economic analysis (TEA) for determining its feasibility, and (4) makes a comparison with the conventional carbon mineralization process based on the LCA and TEA results obtained. In addition, a scenario study is conducted to further analyze the techno-economic feasibility of the KIST process."

      "text" : "The traditional way of producing calcium carbonate (Fig. 1), especially nano calcium carbonate (nCaCO3), involves sub-processes, including limestone calcination, gas scrubbing, and precipitation process. Limestone is fed to a lime kiln and calcined to calcium oxide (CaO) at high temperature (1000 °C) [17,27,28]. In this sub-process, off-gas mostly containing CO2 is emitted. The off-gas is scrubbed by the gas scrubbing process to reduce CO2 emission. CaO is slaked with water, and then converted to calcium hydroxide, which is reacted with CO2 in the flue gas from the kiln, or other CO2 sources. nCaCO3 is separated using a filter. The non-reacted gas from the precipitation reactor contains CO2, so net CO2 emission should be positive. In this study, mass and energy balance data of the conventional process are obtained from the previous studies [27,28]."

      "heading" : "2.2. The KIST process",
      "text" : "A CO2 utilization process analyzed in this study (i.e., the KIST process) produces nCaCO3 using the steel slag process which is performed and developed by KIST [19] and is intended as an alternative to the conventional nCaCO3 production process. The KIST process (Fig. 2) produces very high purity of nCaCO3 using the steel slag. The process comprises six sub-processes: NaCl electrolysis, steel slag crushing, extraction, purification, carbonation, and NaCl solution recycling [19]. Calcium ions extracted from waste steel slag, which contains a large amount of calcium, and CO2 are the reactants of the carbonation reaction, which produces the nCaCO3. Besides, sodium chloride solution is used to produce acid and base solutions, which are used to extract the calcium ions from the steel slag and to remove the impurities (Mg, Al, and Fe ions), respectively. The KIST process is possible to utilize the flue gas without an additional CO2 capture process, which accounts for high portion in the capital cost and energy consumption [29,30]. In this\nstudy, flue gas from a coal-fired power plant [31] is assumed as the CO2 source. The NaCl electrolysis process produces HCl and NaOH solutions from the NaCl solution with the following reaction at 60 °C and 1 bar:\n+ + +aq l aq aq2NaCl( ) H O( ) 2e 2NaOH( ) 2HCl( )2 (1)\nCalcium ions in the crushed steel slag leaving the crushing process are extracted with the HCl solution in the extraction process, and then the non-extracted components of the steel slag are removed by filtration. The filtrated solution contains dissolved Ca ions, as well as dissolved impurity metal ions such as Mg, Al, Fe, and K ions. During purification process, the impurity ion precipitation is induced at a solution pH of 11, which is carried out by the addition of NaOH. Theses precipitated impurities are subsequently removed via filtration. Ca (OH)2 is produced by feeding the rest of the NaOH solution to the filtered solution after the purification process, and then high purity nCaCO3 is produced by supplying flue gas to it. Finally, nCaCO3 is filtered, and the produced NaCl solution is recycled back to the NaCl electrolysis process after a make-up."

      "heading" : "2.3. Simulation model development",
      "text" : "The KIST process comprises six sub-processes. For the purpose of techno-economic analysis and CO2 lifecycle assessment (LCA), a simulation model has been developed using the process configuration and experimental results from an published experimental research [19]. Fig. 3 illustrates the detailed flowsheet of the developed model. The overall process is simulated in Aspen Plus using previously published experimental data [19]. The eNRTL (electrolyte NRTL) equation of state embedded in Aspen Plus is used for thermodynamic calculations. In this process, waste steel slag (CaO, 47.1 wt.%; SiO2, 31.5 wt.%; MgO, 3.9 wt.%; Al2O3 15.2 wt.%; K2O, 0.5 wt.%; Fe2O3, 0.6 wt.%) [19] and flue gas from a coal-fired power plant (CO2, 14.0 Vol.%; N2, 72.2 Vol.%; O2, 3.0 Vol.%; H2O, 10.8 Vol.%) [32] are the major feedstocks.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, NaCl solution is fed into the NaCl electrolysis process (R-101). In the electrolysis cell, NaCl is converted to HCl and NaOH by the reaction in Eq. (1). The electrolysis cell is assumed to be operated at 60 °C and 1 bar [19]. To control the concentrations of the acid (0.5M) and base (1.0M) solutions, water is fed to these solutions (M-101 and M-102, respectively) [19]. After being crushed by the crusher (CRUSHER), the crushed steel slag is fed into the extractor (R102) and then metal ions (Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, and K) are extracted using the 0.5M HCl solution. The extraction process operates at 30 °C and 1 bar condition [19]. The detailed reaction stoichiometry is shown below.\n+ +s aq aq lCaO( ) 2HCl( ) CaCl ( ) H O( )2 2 (2)\n+ +s aq aq lMgO( ) 2HCl( ) MgCl ( ) H O( )2 2 (3)\n+ +s aq aq lFe O ( ) 6HCl( ) 2FeCl ( ) 3H O( )2 3 3 2 (4)\n+ +s aq aq lAl O ( ) 6HCl( ) 2AlCl ( ) 3H O( )2 3 3 2 (5)\n+ +s aq aq lK O( ) 2HCl( ) 2KCl( ) H O( )2 2 (6)\nAmong the extracted metal ions, calcium and magnesium ions are main products of the extraction process. The dissolution efficiency of Ca and Mg ions are estimated using the equations proposed in H. Jo et al. [19]. All the equations used in this study are listed in Table 1. Other efficiency values based on the experimental data are listed in Table 2. In this model, the extraction process operates at the following condition: 0.5M HCl solution at 30 °C with the S L ratio of 50 g/L over 1 h [19].\nAfter being filtered by a sedimentation tank (F-101), which uses gravity sedimentation, the filtrate is sent to the purification unit (R103) to produce Ca ions of high concentration. The pH value of the filtrate solution is 3.80 [19]. The purification unit uses the solubility product (pKSP) value differences among the metal hydroxides. The pKSP values of Ca(OH)2, Mg(OH)2, Fe(OH)3, and Al(OH)3 are 4.05 [33], 10.3 [34], 38.5 [35], and 32.8 [36], respectively. In the purification unit, the metal ion solution and 1.0M NaOH solution split at a constant ratio (22mol.%) by a splitter (S-101) are fed and hydroxylation reactions occur. With increasing pH, precipitation occurs in the order Fe > Al > Mg > Ca according to their solubility product values. Thus, most of the Mg, Fe, and Al ions are precipitated to Mg(OH)2, Fe(OH)3,\nand Al(OH)3. The pH value of the solution increases from 3.8–11.0 [19].\nAfter being filtered by a sedimentation tank (F-102), the Ca ion-rich solution is sent to the carbonation unit (R-104). At low temperature and 1 bar, Ca(OH)2 is precipitated from the Ca ions and the rest of the1.0M NaOH solution. CO2 source is then fed into the carbonation unit and the carbonation reaction occurs to produce nCaCO3. The CO2 conversion through the carbonation reactor is around 95 % [11]. The unreacted gas is separated in the flash drum (SEP-102) from the solution. The porcess outlet gas a very dilute CO2 concentration (0.09mol.% CO2), and hence it is emitted to the atmosphere rather than being recycled. Here,\nbecause the flue gas is directly used as the CO2 source, the benefit from recycling is small compared to the cost of recycling. The reacted solution leaving the carbonation process is filtered with a centrifuge (F-103) to obtain high purity nCaCO3 (80–120 nm [19]). To reduce the raw material cost, NaCl solution recycling should be considered. The NaCl solution filtered by the centrifuge is evaporated, because it contains much higher amount of water. The water separation process consists of two separators (SEP-101 and SEP-102). To reduce the heat consumption, the waste heat of the flue gas is used to increase the temperature of the NaCl solution. The NaCl solution filtered by the centrifuge (F-103) is heated up to 80 °C, and then, some of the water is separated by the first separator (SEP-101). To meet the target concentration of NaCl solution, an additional heater (H-103) is used to remove the water further. The concentrated NaCl solution is recycled back into the NaCl electrolysis process.\nIn addition, pumps for the liquid transportation and shaft work of the vessels (R-102, R-103, and R-104) are considered in this model. Six pumps (P-101 ∼ P-106) are used for the liquid transportation. The shaft work of the vessel is estimated by Nagata’s equation [19]:\n=W N n dvessel p 3 5 (11)\nwhere Np is a dimensionless power number. , n, and d denote the density of the fluid kg m( )3 , stirring rate s( )1 , and the paddle diameter m( ), respectively.

Re is the Reynolds number, and µ (Ps s) is the viscosity of the fluid. The ratios of the reactor and the paddle are specified to be =b D/ 0.1 and =d D/ 0.5 [37,38]. Viscosity is assumed to be 0.002 Ps s. Electricity consumption for crushing the steel slag, Wc (kWh/ton-slag), is estimated by Bond’s equation [19]:\n=W W W W10 (1 1 )c i P F80 80 (17)\nwhereWF80 andWP80 are the 80 % passing sizes of the feed and product slag, respectively [19]. Value of the work index of steel slag W( )i is considered as 30.4 kW h/ton-slag, and we assume that WF80 is 20,000 µm andWP80 is 30 µm. To reduce energy consumption, heat integration and recovery systems should be considered. Within the NaCl electrolysis cell (R-101), the hot outlet stream is used to preheat the feed stream."

Given this purpose, both economic feasibility\nand environmental sustainability of the proposed process with the benchmark conventional process are verified through techno-economic analysis (TEA) and CO2 lifecycle assessment (LCA).\nIn order to evaluate CO2 emission of the KIST process and the traditional process, the system boundaries are set up as shown in Fig. 4. ‘Cradle-to-gate analysis’, which considers the raw material and utility (heat and electricity) production as well as the CO2 utilization process, is chosen. In the present study, CO2 emissions from manufacturing the equipment used in the process are not included within the boundary. There are some assumptions made in calculating the CO2 reduction amount. It is assumed that the flue gas, which is the CO2 source, is already treated through the de-sulfurization and de-NOx processes. For CO2 LCA, various procedures have been proposed and tried [39,40]. This study used the work of Roh et al. [40]. Details are presented in Appendix A.\nTEA is performed to determine and analyze the economic feasibility of the KIST process replacing the conventional process (either to meet the future demand increase or to replace existing facilities).

The characteristics of the significant streams of Fig. 3 are shown in Table 3. As summarized in Table 3, approximately 0.44 ton/h of CO2 and 2.72 ton/ h of steel slag are required to produce 1.01 ton/h of nCaCO3 of high purity (98.5 %). All the significant streams are well matched with the available experimental data [19] (Table 3).\nElectricity consumption for each sub-process is summarized and is validated with the results from the experimental study (Table 4). The energy balance of the KIST process is calculated for 1 ton of nCaCO3 production.

      "text" : "To estimate the CO2 emission, mass and energy balance of the KIST process are recalculated as balance results per the set functional unit (Table 5). In this study, the function unit chosen is 1 ton of nCaCO3 production. In addition, to compare the result with the conventional process, the mass and energy balance data of the traditional process obtained from the previous study are enumerated in Table 6 [27,28].\nUsing the recalculated mass and energy balance data, the net CO2 emission is estimated. Direct/indirect CO2 emission rate of each component is calculated in terms of CO2-equivalent value for a fair comparison. Table 7 lists CO2 emission factors of the utilities and the reactants involved. Coal-fired power generation is assumed as electricity source to estimate indirect CO2 emission. The CO2 emission factor of slag treatment is calculated from the amount of avoided slag landfilling\n[27]. On the other hand, the CO2 emission factor of waste treatment (impurities and disposal) is calculated from the amount of slag landfilling. The CO2 emission factor of lime is estimated from the amount of CO2 emission during lime mining.\nThe CO2 LCA results are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 8. As shown in\nFig. 5, the direct and indirect CO2 emissions are approximately -0.60 ton, and 1.47 ton, respectively, per ton of nCaCO3 production, resulting in a 0.87 ton of net CO2 emission. Compared to the LCA result of the traditional process, the calcium carbonation of this work is capable of reducing the emission by 0.08 ton per ton of nCaCO3 produced. In the conventional process, the biggest contributor to the net CO2 emission is limestone mining (53.7 % of positive emission). On the other hand, indirect CO2 emission from electrical energy is the largest contributor in the proposed system (86.0 % of positive emission). By\nchanging the calcium feedstock from limestone to waste steel slag, the net CO2 emissions can be reduced by 1.02 ton CO2-eq per functional unit. The GHG emission reduction originates from the change of calcium source, i.e., replacing emission-intensive limestone with waste steel slag. The proposed system uses waste steel slag as a calcium source, thus it causes the system to eliminate the steel slag landfill process. On the other hand, the GHG emission from the utility increases significantly due to the NaCl electrolysis process (+0.93 ton CO2-eq per functional unit). However, the net GHG emission of the proposed system is still reduced, and it can potentially save up to 1.5 million ton CO2 per year by replacing the conventional processes globally (nCaCO3 production in 2018: 19 million ton per year [41]). The new process is analyzed to bring a CO2 emission reduction effect primarily because of the changes in the calcium source and process design."

      "text" : "To judge the techno-economic feasibility of the proposed process, a techno-economic analysis (TEA) is conducted. The key financial parameters for the TEA and prices of the utilities and fuels involved are shown in Table 9. In this research, the cost of electricity provided in the previous studies is used for the cost estimation and the cost of electricity based on coal-fired power plant is used as the baseline.\nThe estimated cost is given in Fig. 6 and Table 10. From Fig. 6 and Table 10, the equipment cost of the NaCl electrolysis process occupies the greatest portion of the capital costs (53.1 % of capital cost), while the operating cost for the NaCl electrolysis process accounts for most of the variable operating cost (73.6 %). This is due to the high purchase cost of the NaCl electrolysis cell (1,000 USD/kW [42]) and the high electricity consumption by the NaCl electrolysis reaction. The unit cost of production using the CO2 utilization process is calculated as 484 USD/ton. Compared to the current commercial nCaCO3 cost (400–500 USD/ton), this process is sufficiently competitive. This is especially so given that this value has significant room for improvement, e.g., by\na Average values of the South Korea electric power price (2018.10, Korea Electric Power Statistics Information System).\nb U.S. Geological Survey (2019).\nchanging the primary energy source and lowering the purchase cost of the NaCl electrolysis cell.

      "heading" : "3.4. Sensitivity analysis",
      "text" : "The CO2 emission factor and cost of electricity are highly affected by the primary source. Therefore, we consider six different cases of electricity source for the CO2 utilization process: coal-fired power plant (baseline), biomass (dedicated), natural gas combined cycle (NGCC), photovoltaic (PV), wind (onshore), and nuclear. Using these different energy sources, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to see the influence of the primary energy source. The CO2 emission factors and prices for the different primary energy sources are provided in Tables 7 and 9, respectively. For the sensitivity analysis, only the electricity energy source used in the NaCl electrolysis process, which accounts for the highest portion of net CO2 emission and production costs, is considered.\nThe results of the sensitivity analysis are plotted in Fig. 7. As plotted in Fig. 7(a), PV (−0.09 ton CO2-eq./ton nCaCO3), wind (-0.12 ton CO2eq./ton nCaCO3), and nuclear (−0.08 ton CO2-eq./ton nCaCO3) all show negative net CO2 emissions. This is due to the high electricity consumption by the studied CO2 utilization process and the lower global warming impacts of the renewable energy electricity sources (PV, wind, and nuclear) compared to the fossil-based energy sources (coal-fired and natural gas). As plotted in Fig. 7(b), PV and wind have higher unit costs of production than the fossil fuel (coal, NGCC) cases due to its high operating cost of electricity generation. If the fossil fuel based electricity is replaced entirely by renewable energy (PV and wind), the CO2 utilization process is competitive in terms of net CO2 emission, but uncompetitive in terms of cost. Fig. 7 also indicates that NGCC is not an attractive option due to the high purchase cost of natural gas, but nuclear energy is the best energy source in overall."

As shown in Section 3.4, all the cases used in the sensitivity analysis are uncompetitive in terms of cost, compared to the commercial nCaCO3 price. However, there are some possible ways to improve the economic feasibility of the process. First is to improve the efficiency of the NaCl electrolysis process to reduce its electric power consumption. Until 2030, the efficiency of the\nalkaline electrolysis cell (AEC) process is expected to increase from 62 % to 80 % [42], so its electric power consumption will be reduced. In addition, the capital cost of the electrolysis cell is estimated to decrease to as low as 500 USD/kW from 1000 USD/kW [42].\nA scenario study reflecting this cost estimation is carried out (Fig. 8). For the scenario study, the capital cost of the electrolysis cell is varied from 1000 USD/kW to 500 USD/kW and the coal-fired power plant is assumed as the electric energy source. As plotted in Fig. 8, if the capital cost of the electrolysis cell is reduced to 610 USD/kW, nCaCO3 produced from the CO2 utilization process is competitive in terms of cost, compared to the commercial nCaCO3. The above process improvements can also reduce the power consumption to reduce the amount of indirect CO2 emissions and thereby further decrease the unit cost of production.\nTable 10 Detailed result of techno-economic analysis.\nUnit cost of annual investment cost Total 250.9 USD/ton nCaCO3 NaCl electrolysis 139.4 USD/ton nCaCO3 Extraction 15.0 USD/ton nCaCO3 Purification 15.5 USD/ton nCaCO3 Carbonation 43.6 USD/ton nCaCO3 Crusher 21.6 USD/ton nCaCO3 NaCl recycling 15.9 USD/ton nCaCO3 Unit cost of variable operating cost Total 134.4 USD/ton nCaCO3 Process water 0.02 USD/ton nCaCO3 Steel slag (feed) −0.1 USD/ton nCaCO3 Waste treatement 1.00E-3 USD/ton nCaCO3 NaCl electrolysis 99.0 USD/ton nCaCO3 Extraction 5.1 USD/ton nCaCO3 Purification 1.6 USD/ton nCaCO3 Carbonation 7.4 USD/ton nCaCO3 Crusher 11.2 USD/ton nCaCO3 NaCl recycling 10.3 USD/ton nCaCO3 Unit cost of fixed operating cost 99.1 USD/ton nCaCO3 Unit cost of production 484.4 USD/ton nCaCO3 Total annual investment cost 1.98 million USD/year Total operating cost (fixed+ variable) 1.84 million USD/year Total annualized cost (TAC) 3.82 million USD/year\nFig. 7.

      "heading" : "4. Conclusion",
      "text" : "To assess the commercialization potential of an improved nCaCO3 production process using waste steel slag, its techno-economic feasibility and CO2 reduction impact were investigated. For the CO2 reduction evaluation and techno-economic feasibility of the process, the mass and energy balance was calculated using a simulation model of the CO2 utilization process based on 1 ton of nCaCO3, and its performance was evaluated in terms of economics and CO2 emission reduction. The simulation model was validated using experimental data available. In addition, the proposed process was compared with the conventional nCaCO3 process in terms of CO2 reduction estimation and cost. The conventional process gave 0.95 ton of net CO2 emission per ton of nCaCO3 produced, while the proposed CO2 utilization process gave 0.87 ton, resulting in a net CO2 reduction of 0.08 ton. Technoeconomic analysis based on the same mass and energy balance results estimated the cost of 483 USD per ton of nCaCO3 produced, when the coal-fired power plant was utilized as the electric energy source. These changes caused an energy consumption increase (by 68 %), but the net\nCO2 emission was decreased (by 8 %) because the proposed process replaces the raw material of the conventional process, which come with much higher indirect CO2 emission (limestone: 1.363 kgCO2-eq./kg limestone). Therefore, the new process is analyzed to remain economically feasible while reducing the CO2 emission, primarily because of the changes in the calcium source and process design.\nThe sensitivity analysis results showed that nuclear energy is the most competitive among the examined six sources as it led to the lowest unit cost of production as well as the lowest net CO2 emission. Additionally, an optimistic scenario study based on forecasted technology improvements was conducted to provide the future economic potential of the CO2 utilization process. With the economic feasibility and CO2 emission reduction results in this study, future research should aim to develop energy-efficient commercial-scale processes. In addition, optimization research should be conducted in tandem with development studies to reduce the consumption of utilities and capital cost caused by the overestimation of equipment scale.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nJaeseo Lee: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Validation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Writing - original draft.

      "text" : "Techno-economic analysis (TEA) is a method to evaluate and analyze the techno-economic feasibility of a given process. Key metrics used in TEA are annualized capital cost (ACC) and unit production cost, which is proposed by D. R. Woods [43] and G. Takacs [44]. The key metrics are calculated as:\n= ×ACC CRF TPCC (B.1)\n= + +CRF i i i( 1) (( 1) 1)n n (B.2)\n= +ACC TOC FUnit production cost ( ) P (B.3)\nwhere CRF is capital recovery factor; i is annual discount rate; n is operation time of the system; TPCC is total project capital cost; TOC is total operating cost [44]. A process is economically feasible if the calculated unit production cost of the CO2 utilization process is lower than the current unit price of the product. For the TPCC estimation, the bare module (BM) cost methodology is used. BM considers the equipment purchase cost, installed instrumentation cost (e.g. control systems), tax/insurance cost, and indirect cost."

The analyzed process uses steel slag instead of limestone as the calcium source to produce nano calcium carbonate and comprises a calcium carbonation process and a NaCl electrolysis process. CO2 reduction impact and techno-economic feasibility of the system are analyzed to investigate its feasibility. The new process is expected to reduce the CO2 emission by about 8 %, compared to the conventional process of making the nano calcium carbonate. In addition, unit cost of production for the new process is 484 USD/ton indicating that it is economically feasible. Sensitivity and scenario analyses are performed with respect to the type of electricity sources and the capital cost of the electrolysis system, which are the key contributors to the overall cost.",
