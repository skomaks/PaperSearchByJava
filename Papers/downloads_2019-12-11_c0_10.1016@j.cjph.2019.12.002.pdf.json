      "text" : "The importance of thermophoresis and its essential role in particle migration have led to many published reports (i.e. aim and objectives). However, there exists no report on thermomigration of tiny/nano-sized particles in the motion of various fluids. A meta-analysis on the significance of either nano or tiny particles exposed to thermophoretic force owing to temperature gradient during the dynamics of liquid substances is deliberated upon in this report. The method of slope linear regression through the data point was adopted to scrutinize sixty (60) published reports in which the effects of thermophoresis (thermodiffusion) is deliberated upon. The outcome of the study shows that different responses to the force of a temperature gradient are sufficient enough to enhance the temperature distribution and the concentration of non-Newtonian fluid due to an increase in thermophoresis. Thermophoretic effect increases the concentration of fluids in which the relationship between the shear stress and shear strain is non-linear. Skin friction coefficients is a decreasing function of thermophoresis. Increase in thermophoretic deposition is achievable due to an increase in thermophoresis. The effect of haphazard motion of nanoparticles should be investigated when it increases negligibly and considerably large. Thermal radiation strongly influences the significance of thermo-migration of tiny particles on fluid flow.\nKeywords: Meta-analysis; Thermophoresis; Non-Newtonian fluids; Skin friction Coefficients; Temperature distribution."

      "text" : "The movement of either tiny or nanoparticles from the region of hot to cold environment along the path of a temperature gradient is an unavoidable event during the colloidal crystal growth processes, deposition of aerosol particles across flowing fluids, determination of exhaust gas particle trajectories from combustion devices, removal of small particles from gas streams, and separation of micro-particles; Green and Lane [1] and Fuchs [2]. Zhao et al. [3] remarked that thermo-migration of these particles is indeed a versatile technique in controlling genomic-length as in the case of HIV Virus and DNA. All these have led to an exponentially increase in the knowledge and understanding of thermophoresis as it enhances not only the improvement, but also the production of optical fibers, reduction in chip failures and cleaning of small particles on electronic chips; see Cooper [4], Liu and Ahn [5], Stratmann et al. [6, 7] and Ye et al. [8]). Whenever there are small particles in stagnant or flowing fluids possessing a temperature gradient, a unique force is exerted on the particles due to imbalance forces related to molecular collisions from different regions with different temperatures. This force is commonly in the direction of cold regions and often encountered with aero-colloidal particles rather than colloidal particles. The phenomenon tends to be small in liquids when compared with convection and other forces. The occurrence of this phenomenon can be traced to the collision of molecules on one side of the particles which possess different average velocities from those on the other side due to the temperature gradient; see Sheikholeslami and Rokni [9], Grosan et al. [10], Hayat\net al. [11], Eslamian et al. [12], Kumar et al. [13], Bahiraei and Hosseinalipour [14], Shagaiya et al. [15], Wakif et al. [16], Qayyum et al. [17], Chamkha et al. [18], Shagaiya Daniel et al. [19], and Animasaun [20]. However, its occurrence can be seen on the glass globe of a kerosene lamp or smudges on the wall of a kitchen near the stove where deposits of soot particles or small droplets of grease or oil move from the hot region to the colder surface. The significance of the thermophoresis further led to the description by Geelhoed et al. [21] as the movement of large molecules of fluid substance or colloidal particles in response to a large-scale temperature gradient which is inevitable due to the mixing of different molecular species.\nPioneer reports on the motion of colloids due to temperature gradient ware presented by Carl Ludwig in the year 1856 and Charles Soret in the year 1879; see Burelbach et al. [22]. The report of Tyndall [23] and Aitken [24] on the case of thermophoresis in the year 1870 was an experiment involving gas mixtures in which the formation of streams of dust is apparent around an object moderately heated. James Clerk Maxwell explained the motion of a small and large particle due to a temperature gradient in the year 1873. To further demonstrate the phenomenon, Lord Rayleigh [25] stretched a platinum wire across a beam with its two ends connected to a galvanic battery. The strength of the current was regulated using a rheostat to gradually increase the temperature from the feeble current. Before reaching the heat of ignition, a flat stream of air (i.e. dark region) was observed and tagged destruction of the floating matter. In 1879, Maxwell [26] published a remarkable paper explaining the kinetic theory of non-uniform gas, and the theory of thermophoresis. Talbot [27] pointed out that thermophoresis plays a role in the distribution of soot in flames and leads to soot deposition on cooled gas turbine blades; thus highly relevance in the industry. On the other hand, thermophoretic motion is not the same as buoyancy-driven convection produced owing to the hot surface beneath the cold surface. In the year 1981, Ruckenstein [28] remarked that thermophoresis, electrophoresis, and diffusiophoresis are bound to manifest wherever there exists variation in the surface tension. Bakier [29] further defined thermophoresis suspension of submicron-sized particles in a non-isothermal medium and thus the acquisition of velocity (also known as thermophoretic velocity) relative by each particle in the direction of decreasing temperature. The force (also known as thermophoretic force) experienced by the suspended tiny or nano-sized particles owing to the significance of temperature gradient is inevitable. The analysis of Bahiraei [30] shows that thermophoresis has a relatively significant effect on particle distribution and concentration distribution.\nNanofluids are the man-made colloidal suspension of particles like alumina, gold, silica and copper oxide whose diameter is between the range of 1-100nm in a base fluid (i.e. water, ethanol, kerosene, and blood) without agglomeration (i.e assemblage of the particles). The report of Buongiorno [31] in the year 2006 on the transport phenomenon of nanofluids presents a better model superior to dispersion and homogeneous models in which the properties/nature of nanoparticles and that of the base fluid are incorporated. Considering the fluid within the immediate fluid layers of the nanoparticles as a continuum, seven slip mechanisms including Brownian diffusion and thermophoresis were presented and discussed. Thereafter, several researchers were led to deliberate on the significance of Brownian diffusion and thermophoresis of tiny/nanoparticles within the thin boundary layer. In the year 2010, Kuznetsov and Nield [32] explicitly explained the seven slip mechanisms suggested in Ref. [31] and thus, present the significance of thermophoresis within the boundary-layer flow induced by free convection. The model was considered by Reddy and Chamkha [33], Ghalambaz et al. [34], Zaraki et al. [35] to deliberate on the dynamics of water conveying thermo-migration of Al2O3-water and TiO2. Sequel to all these facts, it is worth remarking that there is no report on the metaanalysis of thermophoresis on concentration, Sherwood number which is proportional to mass transfer rate, skin friction coefficients, Nusselt number which is proportional to heat transfer\nrate, temperature distribution across flowing fluid, velocity of the transport phenomenon, Local Stanton which is proportional to wall deposition flux, and local flux of particles at the wall. Also, exploration of thermophoresis on the thermophoretic deposition, motile microorganisms, concentration of heterogeneous (i.e. catalyst) can be referred to as an open question, hence this study sought to provide answers."

      "heading" : "2. Theoretical Review",
      "text" : "In this subsection, the outcome of the theoretical review of sixty (60) reports on the significance of thermophoresis is presented. During the process of aerosol sampling devices and air cleaning, Goren [36] pointed out the occurrence of thermophoresis and illustrated the concentration of gas particles in a non-isothermal flow field. Variations in the concentration of gas particles at various values of viscous dissipation, Prandtl number, and thermophoretic velocity are presented in the report. The motion of submicrometer-sized particles in gas attracted Jia et al. [37] to study the case of a steady flow of laminar fluid on an impermeable flat surface in the presence of thermal radiation and thermophoresis effects. A report on the significance of surface mass flux on mixed convective flow over a heated vertical flat in the presence of thermophoresis was investigated by Selim et al. [38] owing to its importance being a dominant mass transfer mechanism in the modified chemical vapor deposition process. An implicit finite difference method together with the Keller-box technique was used to obtain the effects of thermophoresis as it is relevant to experts in the manufacturing of graded-index optical fiber preforms. Chamkha and Pop [39] established the impact of thermophoresis particle deposition on the steady laminar boundary layer flow of a typical Newtonian fluid on a porous medium. In the report, the velocity along the vertical surface is of the form u = gKν [βt(T − T∞) + βc(C − C∞)] and thermophoretic deposition velocity Vtm = [(−kPr)/(1 +Nt)]θ′(0) emerged. The aim and objectives of Ref. [39] was extended by Postelnicu [40] to further investigate the case where the velocity along the vertical surface is of the form u = −Kµ ∂p ∂x and the velocity normal to the surface is\nof the form v = −Kµ ( ∂p ∂y + ρg ) . The effect of thermophoresis on the boundary layer flow of a Newtonian fluid along a semi-infinite inclined permeable flat surface in the presence of Lorentz force, thermal radiation was investigated by Alam et al. [41]. In the report on heat and mass transfer, Boussinesq approximation +gβ(T − T∞) and the influence of magnetic field is on the entire domain. Since the flow was forced convection, the significance of Lorentz force on fluid’s domain was incorporated using −σB2oρ (u − U∞). The problem of two-dimensional boundary layer flow of nanofluid induced by forced convection on a horizontal surface in the presence of thermophoresis was investigated by Khan and Pop [42].\nThe governing equation which models micropolar fluid flow due to natural convection in the presence of thermophoresis was presented by Bakier [29]. In the study carried out by Chamkha et al. [43] on nanofluid flow in the presence thermophoresis effect, boundary layer analysis of natural convection over an isothermal porous sphere using the Darcy model was presented. The aim and objectives of the study Ref. [29] was later reduced by Bakier and Gorla [44] to the case of a pure Newtonian fluid in the presence of thermal radiation. In summary, Ref. [44] presents the effects of thermophoresis and thermal radiation on the laminar boundary layer flow along a semi-infinite vertical plate. The mathematical equation suitable to unravel the wall thermophoretic deposition velocity Vm is also presented. A numerical investigation of the effect of thermophoresis in the presence of magnetic field on laminar fluid flow due to stretching of the vertical surface with variable stream conditions in a nanofluid was investigated by Kandasamy et al. [45] using Oberbeck - Boussinesq approximation and Buongiorno model. Using Buongiorno model, a numerical study of the thermophoresis effects on the MHD laminar flow of a viscous incompressible electrically conducting nanofluid over moving chemically reacting porous stretching sheet when momentum and thermal slip are significant, hence incorporated in the boundary\ncondition by Uddin et al. [46]. Anbuchezhian et al. [47] investigated the problems of thermophoresis nano-sized particles in the flowing fluid under the influence of thermal stratification arising from solar energy. Mustafa et al. [48] carried out a study on the magnetohydrodynamic boundary layer flow of a non-Newtonian nanofluid over a stretching sheet. The study led to the investigation of thermophoresis parameter on the dimensionless governing equation which models the flow. The problem of thermophoresis effects on boundary layer flow and heat transfer across the flow of nanofluid over a vertical object with uniform thickness attracted the attention of Wubshet and Bandari et al. [49]. The motion of a nanofluid over a vertical cylindrical surface was investigated by Gorla and Khan [50] using the Oberbeck - Boussinesq approximation in the presence of thermophoresis of tiny particles. The well-known Scaling Group Transformation (SGT) was adopted by Uddin et al. [51] to investigate the skin friction, heat transfer rate, and nanoparticle volume fraction rate in the boundary layer flow of a fluid containing tiny particles on a convectively heated surface in the presence of partial slip, internal heat generation, and suction. The similarity transformations η = y\nx2/3 and ψ = x1/3f(η) was adopted by Jashim\nUddin et al. [52] to investigate the dynamics of incompressible flow of nanofluid in the presence of thermophoresis within the boundary layer formed on a convective heated vertical surface. Nadeem et al. [53] focused on the hemodynamic behavior of non-Newtonian flow of blood dependent on arterial stenosis in the presence of thermophoresis effect. The objectives led to nanoparticle volume fraction analysis on the flow of nano-Prandtl fluid, as in the case of blood with stenosis in a tube whose length is L. Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation was adopted by Poornima and Reddy [54] to examine the simultaneous effects of thermal radiation and Lorentz force on heat and mass transfer across a nanofluid over a nonlinearly stretching sheet. In the study, the model accounts for the significance of thermophoresis. Awad et al. [55] investigated the effects of thermophoresis parameter on magneto-nanofluid flow over a stretching sheet. In addition, the significance of thermal-diffusion and diffusion-thermo was properly accounted for in the same governing equation. Spectral linearisation method was adopted to obtain the numerical solutions of the dimensionless governing equation for momentum, energy, concentration, and mass fraction equation. Thermophoretic effects on the flow of Jeffrey non-Newtonian fluid along a vertical surface when the combined influence of Joule heating and thermal radiation is highly significant have been presented by Shehzad et al. [56]. The two-dimensional flow of Oldroyd-B nanofluid on a linearly stretchable surface when thermophoresis is significant was investigated by Nadeem et al. [57].\nIn the presence of thermophoresis effect, boundary layer flow of Maxwell nanofluid on a horizontal porous surface was investigated by Bakar et al. [58]. At the end of the nondimensionalization, Lewis number, suction parameter and thermophoresis parameter emerged. Vijaya and Mallikarjuna [59] presented the problem of steady natural convection heat and mass transfer over a vertical wavy surface in a homogeneous Darcy porous medium in the presence of thermophoresis. The solutions of the emerged boundary layer equations were solved numerically using Runge-Kutta with shooting technique. Accordingly, the effects of variable viscosity, variable thermal conductivity and thermophoresis parameter were investigated on the fluid velocity, temperature, concentration profiles, and rate of heat and mass transfer. Malvandi and Ganji [60] carried out a theoretical investigation on the effects of thermophoresis and Brownian motion on the flow of alumina/water nanofluid within a circular microchannel under the influence of the magnetic field. The variations of the velocity u/uB, the temperature T\n∗/T ∗B and the nanoparticle volume fraction φ/φB were investigated for varying values of the ratio of Brownian motion to thermophoretic parameters NBT . In the presence of thermophoresis and Joule heating, Mutuku [61] investigated MHD boundary layer flow induced by forced convection and heat transfer of nanofluid over a porous moving surface with the effects of thermal radiation and viscous dissipation. The governing equation suitable to study three-dimensional flow of Maxwell nanofluid subject to thermophoresis at the wall in x− and y−directions was\npresented by Mohammad et al. [62]. In the study, the model for zero nanoparticle mass flux was imposed. Thus, at η = 0, NBφ\n′ +NT θ′′ = 0 exist at the wall. Animasaun [20] unravel the effects of thermophoresis on the flow of Casson fluid, suction, nth order of chemical reaction on a vertical porous surface when viscosity and thermal conductivity are constant and temperature dependent. The effect of thermophoresis, entropy generation on MHD non-Newtonian Casson nanofluid flow on a permeable stretching/shrinking surface was explained by Qing et al. [63]. Mishra et al. [64] investigated numerically MHD convective heat and mass transfer across the flow of nanofluid over a non-linear stretching surface with the effect of thermophoresis, thermal radiation, and ohmic heating. Awais et al. [65] presented MHD boundary layer flow of couple-stress nanofluid over a movable convective wall and thermophoresis. Vijayaragavan [66] presented the significance of thermal radiation, heat source, and thermophoresis of tiny particles in the flow of MHD Casson fluid due to stretching on passively controlled nanofluid at the wall.\nBabu and Sandeep [67] studied the effects of non-linear thermal radiation and bioconvection of MHD nanofluid over a convectively heated stretchable surface. The report presents the analysis of thermophoresis effect on motile microorganism during oblique flow and free stream flow. In the presence of quartic autocatalytic kind of chemical reaction and nonlinear thermal radiation, Makinde and Animasaun [68] explained the effects of thermophoresis on the flow of MHD bioconvection of nanofluid over an upper horizontal surface of a paraboloid of revolution (uhspr). The flow of blood was modeled as third-grade and the viscosity of the non-Newtonian flow was assumed to vary with temperature using constant model, Reynold and Vogel models by Rahbari et al. [69]. The effect of thermophoresis parameter on the flow in the presence of nanoparticles through porous vessels was illustrated. The problem of MHD free convective heat and mass transfer flow on an inclined stretchable surface considering the significance of haphazard motion of unknown tiny particles, Dufour effect, and Soret effect was unraveled by Alam [70]. The problem of two-dimensional MHD boundary layer flow of nanofluid influenced by a porous stretchable surface in the presence of thermophoresis, convectively heat surface and the corresponding effect on the concentration was presented by Hayat et al. [71]. The effects of viscous dissipation and magnetic field on time-dependent MHD thermo-bioconvection boundary layer flow of a nanofluid containing gyrotactic microorganisms along a stretchable surface when the nanoparticle flux is zero was investigated by Hady et al. [72]. Babu et al. [73] investigated heat and mass transfer in MHD boundary layer flow of Eyring-Powell nanofluid on a permeable cone medium in the presence of buoyancy forces, thermophoresis, and suction/injection effects. The significance of Lorentz force and stretching on the flow of unsteady nanofluid over a slender surface in the presence of thermophoresis was scrutinized by Ramana Reddy et al. [74]. The two-dimensional flow of a magnetohydrodynamic fluid along an inclined vertical surface subject to a constant heat flux in the presence of gyrotactic microorganisms and thermophoresis of tiny particles was investigated by Avinash et al. [75]. The dimensionless governing equation was obtained using the stream function ψ = αRa 1/4 x f(η) and dimensionless distance η = y xRa 1/4 x . Sandeep et al. [76] presented the mathematical model which models the flow of Jeffrey and Oldroyd-B nanofluids (a mixture of water and magnetite nanoparticles) over a stretched plate with the transverse magnetic field, space and temperature-dependent heat source/sink, and Brownian movement effects.\nDuring metal spinning, Shateyi [77] remarked that thermophoretic diffusion coefficients, convective mass transfer and convective heat transfer at the wall are highly significant. Hence, adopted spectral relaxation method (SRM) to unfold the effects of thermophoresis on a threedimensional magnetohydrodynamic fluid flow containing nano-sized particles under the influence of thermal radiation, convective heat and mass transfer on a stretchable porous surface in x− and y− directions. The influence of viscous dissipation and thermophoresis of tiny particles in the flow of a steady fully developed hydromagnetic through parallel plates partitioned into\nclear medium (0 < y < D) and porous medium (D < y < H) was investigated by Habib-Olah and Amir [78] owing to the industrial applications of nanofluids in engineering and industrial processes. Using the second law of thermodynamics, the combined effects of nonlinear thermal radiation and thermophoresis of nanoparticles on the flow of magnetohydrodynamics couple stress nanofluid in a convectively heated vertical permeable channel was presented by Makinde and Eegunjobi [81]. In the study, the rate of entropy generation was considered. At the end of non-dimensionalization, the boundary condition of temperature distribution is dependent on the Biot number and the concentration equation of the fluid contains injection/suction Reynolds number. In the presence of thermophoresis of CuO nanoparticles, gyrotactic microorganism, nonlinear thermal radiation, and unequal diffusion coefficients case of isothermal quartic autocatalytic kind of chemical reaction, boundary layer analysis of 29nm CuO/water nanofluid on an upper horizontal surface of a paraboloid of revolution was presented by Koriko et al. [79]. The nanofluid was considered due to the fact that the average particle size of CuO nanoparticle powders produced by Nanophase Technologies Corp., Romeoville, Illinois, USA is 29nm. One of the objectives is the exploration of thermophoresis effect on the concentration gradient of heterogeneous fluid (catalyst) H ′(ς), concentration of heterogeneous fluid (catalyst) H(ς), concentration of homogeneous bulk fluid G(ς), and concentration gradient of the same homogeneous bulk fluid G′(ς) are investigated.\nIn the presence of thermo-diffusion (Soret effect), diffuso-thermal (Dufour effect), Brownian motion and thermophoresis of tiny particles, Kumaran et al. [80], investigate the flow of magnetohydrodynamic chemically reacting Casson and Maxwell fluids over a stretchable surface. In the presence of thermophoresis, Qayyum et al. [82] unraveled the boundary layer flow of tangent-hyperbolic nano liquid induced by stretching surface and buoyancy forces. Khan et al. [83] presented the combined effects of thermophoresis, magnetic and electric field on unsteady flow of Maxwell nanofluid over a stretching surface with thermal radiation. The transport phenomenon of micropolar nanofluid between two rotating parallel plates under the influence of thermophoresis, electric, and the magnetic field was presented by Shah et al. [84]. Usman et al. [85] carried out a study on the velocity and thermal slip effects on the flow of Casson nanofluid with heat and mass transfer over an inclined permeable stretching cylinder. In the study, Buongiorno’s model was considered for the study of thermophoresis effects on the fluid into consideration. The paper discusses the effects of Soret, Dufour, and thermophoresis on mixed hydromagnetic convective heat and mass transfer over an inclined flat plate with uniform thickness coupled with a non-uniform heat source and chemical reaction have been presented by Mondal and Pal [86]. The dynamics of non-Newtonian Casson fluid over a radially stretching surface in the presence of thermophoresis and non-linear thermal radiation can be easily fetched in the report of Dianchen et al. [87]. The theoretical exploration of thermophoresis effects on enrobing dynamics of magnetic nanomaterials as in the case of steady-state transport phenomenon of Casson nanofluid on an isothermal vertical cone induced by partial slip was presented by Subba et al. [88]. In the field of food rheology, flow pattern during the squeezing of fluid can either be classified as lubricated or frictional. It has also been established that squeezing flow helps to determine rheological properties of semi-liquid foods. Based on this, Hosseinzadeh et al. [89] deliberated on the effects of thermophoresis on squeezing nanofluid between two movable plates. In the presence of the Soret effect (i.e. mass transport provoked by thermal gradients), the significance of thermophoresis on the boundary layer flow over a horizontally elongated sheet was presented by Sulochana and Ashwinkumar [90]. The threedimensional flow of a fluid which behaves perfectly like a mixture of Casson-Nanofluid in the presence of thermophoresis on a dual surface with variable thickness was presented by Durgaprasad et al. [91]. The aim of the paper specifically focused on the suspension of graphene nanoparticles at 10 degrees and 50 degree Celsius. The significance of thermophoresis of tiny particles in the unsteady dissipative flow of Casson fluid in the presence of Lorentz force and\nenergy flux due to mass (concentration) gradient was presented by Avinash et al. [92].\nFig. 1: Method of slope linear regression through the data points on Microsoft Excel 2007"

      "heading" : "3. Systematic Review Procedure",
      "text" : "Step-by-step procedure of meta-analysis suggested by Neyeloff et al. [93] was considered but not suitable. This could be traced to the fact that calculations of weighted effect size (w× es), outcome size, test measures of heterogeneity, variance (Var), individual study weights (w), standard error (SE) and a number to quantify the heterogeneity of all the reported studies on the effects of thermo-migration of tiny/nano-sized particles in the motion of various fluids are not realistic. In this section, the method of slope linear regression through the data points on Microsoft Excel was used. To illustrate the technique, let consider a case in which the effects of the buoyancy parameter on the skin friction coefficient at PST and PHF are investigated as shown in Fig. 1. The formula on Excel for Skin friction Coeff. PST = SLOPE(C4 : C7, B4 : B7). The formula on Excel for Skin friction Coeff. PHF = SLOPE(D4 : D7, B4 : B7). Using the method of slope linear regression through the data points in Fig. 1 above, it is seen that the local skin friction coefficient for the case of PST increases with thermal Grashof number at the rate of 0.353. However, the local skin friction coefficients for the case of PHF decreases with thermal Grashof number at the rate of −0.0811. According to Pfister et al. [94], Shah et al. [95], Koriko et al. [96], Animasaun et al. [97, 98, 99] slope extraction for multiple points can be summarized, the method can be used to quantify, explore and differentiate between the effects of dimensionless number. In the report of Goren [36], the ratio of wall temperature to free stream temperature was quantified as 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 0.90. At each stage, the effects of thermophoretic velocity (K) on the concentration of dust particle in the absence of Brownian motion is presented. When Tw/T∞ = 0.25, decrease in concentration cw/c∞ with K was estimated as −0.324. When Tw/T∞ = 0.9, decrease in concentration with thermophoretic velocity was quantified as −0.064.\nIn the study carried out by Jia et al. [37], the effects of thermophoretic coefficient (K) on local flux of particles at the wall (Jw) and aerosol concentration at the wall (φw) when stream\nwise boundary-layer coordinate ξ = 0 and ξ = 1 were extracted. When ξ = 0, it was observed that Jw increases with K at the rate of 0.22278 and φw decreases with K at the rate of −0.18989. At the larger values of stream wise boundary-layer coordinate (i.e. ξ = 1), Jw increases with K at the rate of 0.19244 and φw decreases with K at the rate of −0.16038. Based on this method of analysis, it was deduced that the rate of increase in local flux of particles at the wall when ξ = 0 is greater than that of ξ = 1; see table 1. Selim et al. [38] discovered that the local Stanton number increases with thermophoretic parameter at the rate of 0.152762763. The concentration of the fluid was also presented as a decreasing function of thermophoretic parameter at the rate of −0.28. One of the results observed by Chamkha and Pop [39] is a decrease in the concentration of the flowing fluid with thermophoresis parameter at the rate of −0.000318221 (this was estimated at η = 0.125). Thermophoretic deposition velocity Vtm in the presence and absence of buoyancy parameter N are presented. In the absence of buoyancy, Vtm decreases at the rate of −0.00001. Meanwhile, when the buoyancy effect is significant (N = 50), Vtm decreases at the rate of −0.000029. Postelnicu [40] discovered that thermophoretic deposition velocity Vtm decreases at the rate of −0.00001 in the absence of buoyancy. When the buoyancy effect is significant (N = 50), Vtm decreases at the rate of −0.000013. When Pr = 0.7, Sc = 0.60, R = 0.4 and α = 30o, the investigation of Alam et al. [41] revealed that a decrease in the concentration of the Newtonian fluid within the fluid domain (2 ≤ η ≤ 4.5) with an increase in thermophoretic parameter (τ) is evident at the rate of −0.04. In the absence of the local buoyancy parameter (γ = 0) and at a larger magnitude (γ = 5), it was discovered that local Stanton number which is proportional to wall deposition flux (i.e. StxScRe 1/2 x ) increases with τ at the rate of 0.06 and 0.0625 respectively.\nTable 1 : Variations in the local flux of particles at the wall (Jw) and aerosol concentration at the wall (φw) with thermophoretic coefficient (K) K Local Particle flux Aerosol Conc.

Further observed that for Pr = 1, Nusselt number NuxRe 1/2 x decreases with Nt when Nb = 0.1 at the rate of −0.2 and for Nb = 0.5 at the rate of −0.14. The result of Bakier [29] indicates that both concentration of the micropolar fluid and velocity of the transport phenomenon increase with thermophoretic parameter at the rate of 0.012836168 and 0.0015143 respectively. Moreover, a decrease in the concentration near the wall is also apparent due to suspension of randomly particles of micropolar fluid. This was estimated at η = 0.25 as −0.00124669. In the report of Chamkha et. al [43], the skin-friction S′′(ξ, 0), heat transfer rate −θ′(ξ, 0) and mass transfer rate −f ′(ξ, 0) are decreasing functions of thermophoresis parameter with rates estimated at ξ = 0.5 as −0.0298, −0.17 and −1.75 respectively. When Schmidt number Sc = 5, thermal radiation N = 0.5, modified Prandtl number P−1rm = 0.1, and at η = 0.5, it was observed that the velocity function increases with thermophoresis parameter κ at the rate of 0.001796014; see Bakier and Gorla [44]. Also, the concentration of the flow was found to be an increasing function of κ. The rate\nof increase in φ(η) with κ at η = 0.25 was estimated as 0.014838846. When the magnitude of Prandtl number P−1rm = 1 and P −1 rm = 20, the local skin friction coefficient increases at the rate of 0.00193 and 0.00492 respectively. Likewise, the Nusselt number increases with κ when P−1rm = 1 at the rate of 0.00021 and when P −1 rm = 20 at the rate of 0.00171. Reverse is the effect on mass transfer rate (Sherwood number) as it decreases with κ at the rate of −0.00321 and −0.01146 for P−1rm = 1 and P−1rm = 20 respectively. Also, the dimensionless wall thermophoretic deposition velocities Vm increases negligibly with κ when P −1 rm = 0.05. The same property is found to increase significantly with κ when P−1rm = 0.4. These were estimated using the Slp as 0.015 for lower value of P−1rm and 0.07 for larger value.\nIn the case of the effect of thermophoresis parameter Nt considered by Kandasamy et al. [45], both the temperature profile and nanoparticle volume fraction profile are discovered to be an increasing function of Nt with rates 0.277757 and 0.02061 respectively. In the study conducted by Uddin et al. [46], both the concentration profile and temperature distribution are observed to be an increasing functions of thermophoresis parameter Nt with rates estimated at η = 2 as 0.21 and 0.04 respectively. In the study of Anbuchezhian et al. [47] on the analysis of the effects of thermophoresis parameter Nt on the temperature and nanoparticle volume fraction profiles. It was discovered that Nt has significant effects on the temperature and nanoparticle volume fraction profiles. The effects were estimated at η = 0.25 using Slp through the data points as 0.0947201 and −0.04343 respectively. In the study by Mustafa et al. [48], the thermophoresis parameter Nt was discovered to increase the concentration of the second grade nanofluid near a convectively heated wall at the rate of 1.765. At the wall, a temperature distribution was observed to be an increasing function of thermophoresis parameter Nt at the rate of 0.155405. Furthermore, the thermophoresis parameter has a decreasing effect on the concentration profile with slope estimated at η = 2 as −0.372449; see figure eleven of Wubshet and Bandari [49]. When the Lewis number (Le) and the magnitude of non-similar parameter (ξ) are small (i.e. Le = 2 and ξ = 1) Gorla and Khan [50] observed that with an increase in the magnitude of thermophoresis parameter (Nt), skin friction coefficient Cf decreases at the rate of −0.2554, Nusselt number NuRa −1/2 x decreases at the rate of −0.2134, and Sherwood number ShRa−1/2x also decreases at the rate of −0.42. At larger values of Lewis number (Le = 5) and nonsimilar parameter (ξ = 5), it was seen that skin friction coefficient and Nusselt number NuRa −1/2 x are decreasing properties of Nt at the rate of −0.277 and −0.5209. Meanwhile, Sherwood number ShRa −1/2 x increases with Nt at the rate of 2.4431.\nWhen the magnitude which denotes Brownian motion of tiny particles Nb = 0.1, Biot number is extremely large (Bi → ∞), and Le = Pr = 10; Uddin et al. [51] observed that reduced Nusselt number and Sherwood number increase with Nt at the rate of 0.24301 and 1.82424 respectively. The result above was further investigated for the case when the magnitude of Biot number is small (i.e. Bi = 0.1), the magnitude of Brownian motion has been increased (Nb = 0.4), and Le = Pr = 10. In the article, it was unraveled that the so-called reduced Nusselt number can be decreased with Nt at the rate of −0.05292. For this new case, the reduced Sherwood number is an increasing property of Nt at the rate of 0.5205. In the absence of suction/blowing (fw = 0), convective heat transfer is sufficiently large (γ = 1000), Lewis number (Le = 10), and Brownain motion of parameter Nb = 0.3, Jashim Uddin et al. [52] discovered that Nusselt number decreases with thermophoresis at the rate of −0.11823. Nadeem et al. [53] investigated the effect of Nt on concentration for the three cases (i.e. non-tapered artery, converging tapering, and diverging tapering). At z = 0, the concentration of the nonNewtonian fluid decreases at the rate of −0.00975. The outcome of the study carried out by Poornima and Reddy [54] indicates that temperature distribution θ(η) is an increasing function of thermophoresis parameter at the rate of 0.107091172 measured at η = 2. Meanwhile, concentration of the fluid decreases negligibly with Nt at the rate of −0.192307692 measured\nat η = 0.9. The result of the study by Awad et al. [55] shows that increase in the magnitude of thermophoresis parameter leads to an increase in both the temperature across the fluid and nanoparticle volume fraction (concentration) profiles. It was however seen that temperature distribution increases at the rate of 0.162712 while the nanoparticle volume fraction increases at the rate of 0.483051. Also, increasing the magnitude of thermophoresis parameter leads to a decrease in the heat transfer coefficient Nur when the magnitude of Prandtl number is small (Pr = 2) and considerable large (Pr = 10). Moreso, the rates of decrease of the heat transfer coefficient for Pr = 2 and Pr = 10 are −0.25 and −1.31 respectively.\nShehzad et al. [56] discovered that heat transfer rate −θ′(0) decreases with thermophoretic parameter τ at the rate of −0.0006. Also, mass transfer rate −φ′(0) is an increasing property of τ at the rate of 0.07348. The result of this study further indicates that local skin friction coefficients increases with τ at the rate of 0.000905. Nadeem et al. [57] discovered that temperature and concentration are increasing properties of thermophoresis parameter Nt. The rate of increase in these properties of the flow was estimated at η = 2 as 0.115 and 0.21 respectively. In the same study, the effects of Nt on the flow when the magnitude of Brownian motion is small (Nb = 0.3) and large of Brownian motion (Nb = 0.7) are presented. When Prandtl number is less than Lewis number and Nb = 0.3, Nusselt number decreases with Nt at the rate of −0.135. At a larger value (i.e. Nb = 0.7), Nusselt number decreases with Nt at the rate of −0.1165. But, when Prandtl number is greater than Lewis number and Nb = 0.3, Nusselt number decreases with Nt at the rate of −0.482857143. At a larger value of Brownian motion (i.e. Nb = 0.7), Nusselt number decreases with Nt at the rate of −0.023214286. Moreover, when Nb = 0.3, Sherwood number which is proportional to mass transfer rate increases with Nt at the rate of 0.5681. When Nb = 0.7, mass transfer rate increases with Nt at the rate of 0.228325. In the study carried out by Bakar et al. [58], thermophoresis parameter increases within the range of 0.1 ≤ Nt ≤ 0.7. It was discovered that the physical quantity −θ′(η) decreases with Nt when Pr = 10, Le = 1 and Nb = 0.1 at the rate of −1.140344396.\nIn the study carried out by Vijaya and Mallikarjuna [59], the effect of thermophoresis parameter (τ) on the velocity profile u(η) was examined near the surface η = 2. An increasing effect with the slope estimated as 0.07275625 was observed. However, the thermophoresis parameter (τ) was observed to have a reduction effect on the temperature field, with the slope of linear regression through data points estimated at η = 2 as −0.0099044. In the same vein, the concentration profile (φ) was observed (at η = 2) to be an increasing function of thermophoresis parameter τ with slope of linear regression through data points estimated as 0.06895911. At the leading edge (ξ = 0), it was shown that Nusselt number increases with τ . This increase was quantified by estimating Slp as 0.0168. Also, at ξ = 0 Sherwood number was found to be a decreasing property of thermophoresis parameter τ . The observed decrease was quantified using Slp as −0.121. Malvandi and Ganji [60] observed that the parameter NBT which is a ratio of Brownian motion to thermophoretic parameters has dual effects on the three profiles (i.e. u/uB, T\n∗/T ∗B, and φ/φB). The velocity profile u/uB was observed to decrease with increasing NBT within the domain 0 ≤ η ≤ 0.4. The decrease was approximated at η = 0.25 using Slp through the data points as −0.00183. However, reverse was observed when η > 0.4 till free stream and it was estimated at η = 1 at the rate of 0.0040203. Also, NBT is seen to have a negative effect on the temperature profiles T ∗/T ∗B from the wall until it gets to the middle of the microchannel (i.e η = 0.5). The decrement was estimated at η = 0.25 using Slp through the data points as −0.00314 while from the point η > 0.5 till free stream, T ∗/T ∗B increases with NBT and the increase was estimated at η = 1 through the data points as 0.0065921. The volume fraction of the nanoparticle φ/φB is an increasing function of NBT within the region 0 ≤ η ≤ 0.4 and the increase was estimated as 0.042777 at the wall. Although, the nanoparticle volume fraction φ/φB was observed to decrease outside this domain till free stream and the\ndecrease was estimated at the middle of the microchannel (i.e η = 0.5) as −0.01881.\nIn the report by Mutuku [61], the heat transfer decreases at the rate of −0.27875 and the mass transfer increases at the rate of 0.214 but with no effect on the skin coefficient as the thermophoresis increases. Mohammad et al. [62] observed that at η = 2.25, thermophoresis parameter enhances the temperature distribution across the flow at the rate of 0.01. In addition, it was seen that thermophoresis parameter has a dual effect on the concentration of the fluid φ(η). At the wall η = 0, φ(η) decreases with NT at the rate of −0.696. Also, optimal effect of NT on the concentration at η = 2.2 was estimated as 0.37. Also, when the magnitude of Brownian motion was fixed NB = 0.5, the local Nusselt number decreases with Nt at the rate of −0.0406. Animasaun [20] discovered that when the thermo-physical properties of the Casson fluid (viscosity and thermal conductivity) are constant, thermophoresis has no significant effect on the horizontal velocity. However, when viscosity and thermal conductivity are temperature dependent, ξ = 5&ε = 2, velocity of the Casson fluid in the presence of Dufour effect decreases with thermophoresis τ at the rate of −0.00926338 (evaluated at η = 3) and temperature increases at the rate of 0.000350425 (evaluated at η = 3). In addition, when viscosity and thermal conductivity are constant function of temperature, evaluated at η = 2.5, concentration φ decreases with τ at the rate of −0.056075516. When viscosity and thermal conductivity are temperature dependent, φ decreases at the rate of −0.032548774. Qing et al. [63] discovered that an increase in the thermophoresis parameter leads to a decrease in the Sherwood number at the rate of −1.087. Mishra et al. [64] remarked that the velocity increases as the thermophoresis parameter Nt increases at the rate of 0.1103.\nThe Nusselt number and Sherwood number decreases and increases with thermophoresis parameter at the rate of −0.06636 and 0.05957 respectively in the report by Awais et al. [65]. In the study carried out by Vijayaragavan [66], the concentration and the temperature in the flow of Casson fluid containing tiny particles increase as the thermophoresis parameter increases at the rate of 4.5 and 0.03 respectively. In the study carried out by Babu and Sandeep [67], it was reported that temperature distribution θ(η) is an increasing function of thermophoresis parameter for oblique flow and free streamflow. With an increase in the magnitude of thermophoresis parameter Nt, θ(η = 0.5) increases at the rate of 0.026 for oblique flow and 0.03 for free streamflow. In addition, concentration φ(η) increases with Nt. Where the optimal effect is observed η = 1.1, it was found that φ increases with Nt at the rate of 0.055 for oblique flow and increases with Nt at the rate of 0.06 for free streamflow. With an increase in the magnitude of Nt, for oblique flow, reduced Nusselt number decreases at the rate of −0.002626, reduced Sherwood number decreases at the rate of −0.043734 and motile microorganisms decreases at the rate of −0.021067. Also, the method was used to explore the effects of thermophoresis parameter on the reduced Nusselt number, reduced Sherwood number and motile microorganisms for free streamflow. The report shows that Nusselt number decreases at the rate of −0.002958, reduced Sherwood number decreases at the rate of −0.0521175, and motile microorganisms decrease at the rate of −0.0267865. The result of Makinde and Animasaun [68] shows that the concentration gradient of homogeneous bulk fluid within the region 0.4 ≤ ς < 6 and the concentration profile of heterogeneous catalyst at the surface are increasing functions of the thermophoresis parameter Nt. The increments were estimated at ς = 1 and ς = 0.2 using Slp through the data points as 1.725 and 1.29 respectively. An increase in the value of Nt resulted in the decrease in the concentration profile of homogeneous bulk fluid and the profiles which represent the concentration gradient of the catalyst at the surface. The decrements were estimated at ς = 0.2 and ς = 1 using Slp through the data points as −2.97 and −1.025 respectively.\nIn the study carried out by Rahbari et al. [69], the velocity of the transport phenomenon v(r), temperature distribution across the flow θ(r) and concentration of the nanoparticles φ(r)\nare found to be an increasing functions of thermophoresis parameter Nt. At r = 1.4, with an increase in the magnitude of thermophoresis parameter, the increase in v(r) was estimated as 0.0052. Also, at r = 1.6, an increase in θ(r) with Nt was estimated as 0.132. At r = 1.4, the rate of increase in φ(r) due to Nt was estimated as 0.136. In the report of Alam [70], it was observed that the velocity and concentration of the fluid flow are decreasing functions of thermophoresis parameter (τ) at the rate of −0.23333 and −0.43333 respectively evaluated at η = 0.6 and η = 1.2. With an increase in the magnitude of thermophoresis parameter, the temperature increases at the rate of 0.0333 evaluated at η = 1.1. It was also reported that in the absence of thermal boundary condition (n), the Nusselt number decreases at the rate of −0.006139 for various values of (τ). Meanwhile, in the presence of thermal boundary condition (n = 2), the Nusselt number decreases at the rate of −0.009296. Hayat et al. [71] reported that increasing the thermophoresis parameter Nt yields an increasing value for the temperature and the concentration. The increase for temperature was quantified by estimating Slp as 0.072 at η = 1 while for concentration the Slp was estimated at η = 1 as 0.445714. When Schmidt number is two, the heat transfer rate −θ′(η) was found to be a decreasing function of the thermophoresis parameter at the rate of −0.042. It was reported by Hady et al. [72] that the velocity decreases at the rate of −1.02741 estimated at η = 0.36 for various values of the thermophoresis parameter. In the same vein, increasing the thermophoresis parameter reduces the volume fraction at the rate of −0.4 away from the wall. At the wall, the same parameter increases the volume fraction at the rate 7.15.\nBabu et al. [73] reported that the velocity increases for both injection and suction at the rate of 0.15 and 0.35 for various values of thermophoresis parameter. The concentration of the fluid also increases for injection and suction at the rate of 0.8 and 0.7 as the value of thermophoresis increases. The results presented by Ramana Reddy et al. [74] show that when Brownian motion Nb = 0.2, Schmidt number Sc = 0.6, Lorent force M = 2, with an increase in the magnitude of thermophoresis parameter, local skin friction coefficients is not influenced (Slp = 0), Nussselt number decreases (Slp = −0.037127255), and Sherwood number increases (Slp = 0.021026052). At η = 4, optimal increasing effect of Nt on the temperature distribution is at the rate of 0.047845691 while optimal decreasing effect on the concentration is at the rate of −0.025751503. In the article published by Avinash et al. [75], it was deduced that an increase in the value of thermophoresis parameter (Nt) corresponds to a negligible decrease in local Nusselt number NuxRa −1/4 x , local Sherwood number ShxRa −1/4 x and local motile microorganisms NnxRa −1/4 x with slope of linear regression through data points (Slp) estimated as −0.010101626, −0.035925926 and −0.057317073 respectively, whereas Cf was discovered to be an increasing coefficients of Nt with slope of linear regression through data points (Slp) estimated as 0.059350394. Sandeep et al. [76] discovered that concentration χ(ζ) of Jeffrey and Oldroyd-B nanofluids are increasing functions of thermophoresis parameter with Slp (evaluated at ζ = 0.5) as 1.05 and 0.95 respectively.\nIn the study carried out by Shateyi [77], when Nb = 0.1, Bit = Bic = 0.2, the Nusselt number defined as < i > −θ′(0) < /i > was observed to be a decreasing properties of the thermophoresis parameter Nt and this was quantified as −0.2730895. Also, the Sherwood number defined as < i > −φ′(0) < /i > increases with an increase in the values of the thermophoresis parameter Nt. The rate of increase was estimated as 0.1073415. Furthermore, the temperature distribution and concentration profiles are seen to be influenced positively by the increase in the magnitude of thermophoresis parameter Nt. The increments were estimated at η = 5 and η = 3 using Slp through the data points as 0.007869 and 0.00889 respectively. Habib-Olah and Amir [78] noticed that thermophoresis parameter was observed to enhance the temperature profile with Slp (evaluated at the point η = 0.4) as 0.453464169. In the study conducted by Makinde and Eegunjobi [81], it was observed that concentration φ(η) which denotes (mass diffusion) is\na decreasing function of the thermophoresis parameter. The rate of decrease in φ(η) at η = 0.4 was calculated using Slp as −0.02. Also, it was also observed that the Bejan number Be (a dimensionless quantity which measures the pressure drop within the channel) is a decreasing property of thermophoresis parameter Nt. The rate of decrease in the property was quantified at η = 0 using Slp as −0.006625. It is worth mentioning that the decreasing effect of Nt on the Bejan number Be is significant near the wall of the channel. However, Koriko et al. [79] observed that G(ς = 0.5) is a decreasing function of Nt at the rate of −1.765714286. The effects of Nt on the concentration gradient G\n′(ς) was investigated at the point ς = 1.5. It was discovered that G′(ς) is an increasing property of Nt at ς = 1.4 with Slp estimated as 0.76. It was observed that thermophoresis parameter enhances the concentration of heterogeneous fluid (catalyst) H(ς = 0.5) quantified using Slp as 0.834285714. At the point ς = 1.5, the effect of Nt on the concentration gradient of heterogeneous bulk fluid H ′(ς) was illustrated. It was observed that H ′(ς) decreases with Nt. The decreasing effect was quantified using Slp estimated at the point ζ = 1.5 as −0.508571429.\nIn the study conducted by Kumaran et al. [80], the effects of thermophoresis parameter Nt on the concentration φ(η) of Maxwell and Casson fluid was observed at η = 3. In both cases, φ(η) is an increasing function of Nt with slope estimated as 0.85. Some of the facts that was established by Qayyum et al. [82] at a fixed value of Brownian motion parameter (Nb = 0.3) are increase in the temperature distribution and concentration of the fluid due to thermophoresis parameter Nt and such observed increases were quantified at η = 0 as 0.142980936 and 0.643 respectively. It was seen that the effect of increasing values of Nt is to decrease the Sherwood number and such decrease was estimated as −0.1965. The influence of thermophoresis parameter on the concentration profile was investigated by Khan et al. [83]. It was discovered that the concentration profile is an increasing function of thermophoresis parameter Nt with slope of linear regression through data points estimated at η = 2 as 0.047121. In the report of Shah et al. [84], it was noticed that increasing the magnitude of thermophoresis parameter Nt, temperature distribution and concentration of the fluid increase. Optimal effects of this parameter on both physical quantities at η = 0.4 were observed within the fluid domain and quantified as 0.765 and 0.41. In the same report, effects of Nt on the temperature gradient at the wall for the case of strong concentration microstructures (k = 0) and weak concentration microstructures (k = 0.5) are presented. It is worth mentioning that −Θ′(0) and −Φ′(0) are proportional to local heat transfer and mass transfer rates respectively. In view of this, negative sign was used to multiply the results presented as table four by the authors. When k = 0, the decreasing effect on −Θ′(0) was estimated as −0.312127027 while that of case k = 0.5 was estimated as −0.394106757. Moreover, when k = 0, the increasing effect on −Φ′(0) was estimated as 0.072090541 while that of case k = 0.5 was estimated as 1.388256757.\nIn the report of Usman et al. [85], concentration profile is an increasing function of thermophoresis parameterNt. Such increase is at the rate of 0.365 (evaluated at η = 1). Accordingly, the graph of Nusselt number −θ′(0) against thermal slip parameter (δ) was studied and it was discovered that Nt has a reduction effect on −θ′(0) at the rate of −0.75 (evaluated at δ = 0). However, the graph of mass transfer −φ′(0) against curvature parameter (c) revealed that Nt has an increasing effect on the property at the rate of 0.25 (evaluated at c = 0). Some of the results of Pal and Mondal [86] are decrease in the velocity and concentration of the thermophoresis particle τ . At η = 0.55 and η = 1, decrease in the velocity function f ′(η) and concentration function φ(η) were estimated as −0.028 and −0.076 respectively. Mondal and Pal [86] further reveled that thermophoresis particle deposition is suitable to decrease both skin-friction coefficient and local Nusselt number, and increase the local Sherwood number. The decrease in Cf and Nux were estimated as −0.11636662 and −0.036818011, while the increase in Shx was estimated as 0.28613952. In the study carried out by Dianchen et al. [87] it was observed that\nan increase in thermophoresis parameter gives an increase in the temperature distribution which was quantified at η = 2 as 0.068. The outcome of the same report shows that concentration φ(η) of the non-Newtonian fluid enhances within the domain of 0.7 ≤ η < 6 with Nt at the rate of 0.4. At the wall (η = 0), φ(η) decreases with Nt at the rate of −0.352. Furthermore, the value of Nusselt number which is proportion to local heat transfer rate decreases due to an increase in the magnitude of thermophoresis parameter and such decrease was estimated as −3.605005086.\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\nBakier [29]\nWubshet and Bandari [49] Vijayaragavan [66]\nRahbari et al.

[92]\nSlope linear Regression through the data points for concentration\nWith an increase in the magnitude of thermophoresis parameter (Nt) in the study by Subba et al. [88], an increase in the velocity of the flow and concentration of the fluid substance were observed. Meanwhile, a decrease in the temperature distribution due to Nt can be deduced from the report. The increase in horizontal velocity was measured at η = 1.4 as 0.013121547 and the increase in the concentration at η = 1.25 was estimated as 0.532044199. The decrease in the temperature at η = 1.6 was estimated as −0.026243094. Hosseinzadeh et al. [89] revealed that temperature distribution across the flow of squeezed nanofluid through parallel plates and the concentration of the liquid are decreasing and increasing properties. Using the slope of linear regression through the data points, a decrease in the temperature was estimated as −0.114974619 while the increase in concentration was estimated as 0.157360406. At the end of the analysis of Sulochana and Ashwinkumar [90], temperature distribution across the flow is shown to be an increasing function of thermophoresis parameter. The nature of such increase was quantified at η = 2 as 0.52. Away from the horizontal elongated wall, concentration of the fluid substance is seen to be an increasing property which was estimated at η = 2.5 as 0.6. Heat and mass transfer rates (−θ′(0) and −φ′(0)) are found to be a decreasing and an increasing coefficient of thermophoresis parameter Nt. These results are quantified using Slp as −0.40771 and 1.29094 respectively. The outcome of the study conducted by Durgaprasad et al. [91] reveals that the concentration of Casson-Nanofluid for the case of graphene nanoparticles at 10 degree and 50 degree Celsius increase with thermophoresis near the surface ς = 0.5 as 0.35\nand 0.1 respectively. Also, at ς = 0.5, the temperature distribution across the flow was found to be an increasing function with thermophoresis (Nt) for the two cases (graphene nanoparticles at 10oC and 50oC) as 0.8 and 0.45 respectively. The method of slope linear regression through the data point reveals that the rate of decrease in the Nusselt number with Nt for the case of 10oC (Slp = −1.05783) is lower than that of 50oC (Slp = −0.4482). For the case of graphene nanoparticles at 10 degree, the Sherwood number decreases with Nt at the rate of −0.63271. Meanwhile, for the case of graphene nanoparticles at 50 degree, Sherwood number decreases at the rate of −0.641045. The investigation carried out by Avinash et al. [92] shows that temperature is an increasing property of thermophoresis parameter Nt at the rate of 0.05 for steady flow and at the rate of 0.02 for an unsteady flow (estimated at η = 1). The concentration of the fluid is also observed to be an increasing function of Nt at the rate of 1.3 for steady flow and at the rate of 0.87 for an unsteady flow (estimated at η = 0.25). For steady flow, with an increase in the magnitude of thermophoresis parameter Nt, the local skin friction coefficient remains the same (i.e. at the rate of 0), Nusselt number increases at the rate of 0.0571 and Sherwood number decreases at the rate of −4.0088. Further observed that for an unsteady case, the Nusselt number decreases with Nt at the rate of −2.004318."

      "text" : "The study carried out by Goren [35] shows that the rate of decrease in concentration of the dust with thermophoresis can be maximized when the ratio of wall temperature to free stream temperature is large. One of the reasons why Nt decreases the concentration profile in the report of Makinde and Eegunjobi [81] is the presence of the Biot number Bi which accounts for the significance in the variation of the heat conduction inside a body and heat convection away from the body surface when immersed in a fluid. The Biot value used in the study is Bi = 0.1 which is an indication that the heat convection away from the surface of the body, when immersed in the fluid, is much faster than heat conduction inside the body. It is worth pointing out that the concentration of all the non-Newtonian fluid increases with thermophoresis. The only exception is the case of Bakier [42] where Talbot model was used to discover that the concentration of micropolar fluid decreases with thermophoresis within the fluid domain\nnear the wall. In another study by Shah et al. [84], figure twenty-six, on the effect of thermophoresis on the dynamics of micropolar fluid using Buongiorno model, it is observed that the concentration is an increasing property of thermophoresis. This contradiction can not be traced to the presence of Hall effect but due to different models that were used in both papers. The outcome of this study shows that figure 2b presented by Awad et al. [55] and figure 10 presented by Sulochana and Ashwinkumar [90] indicate an increase in the concentration of nanofluid models as Newtonian with thermophoresis. These are erroneous due to repetition because Awad et al. [55] presented combined effects of energy flux caused by the composition gradient (Dufour effect) and thermophoresis together. Also, Sulochana and Ashwinkumar [92] focused on the dynamics of nanofluid models as Newtonian in the presence of mass flux created by a temperature gradient (Soret effect) and thermophoresis. In other reports by Alam [70], and Ref. [86] Dufour effect, Soret effect, and thermophoresis were investigated using Talbot model. It is deduced that in this case, the concentration decreases with thermophoresis at the rate of −0.4333 in Ref. [70] and at the rate of −0.076 in Ref. [86]. Table 2 presents all the observed decreasing effects of concentration due to an increase in the thermophoresis.\nIn the case of non-Newtonian Maxwell fluid subject to zero nanoparticle mass flux, a significant increase in the concentration at the middle is assured; see Hayat et al. [62]. In addition, it is worth mentioning that negligible increase in the concentration with thermophoresis is achievable if the vertical surface is wavy as presented by Vijaya and Mallikarjuna [59]. An attempt was made to scrutinize the report of Bakier [42] on the concentration of micropolar fluid, Mustafa et al. [48] on the concentration of second grade nanofluid on a convectively heated, Nadeem et al. [57] on the concentration of Oldroyd-B nanofluid, Vijayaragavan [66] on passively controlled Casson nanofluid in the presence of thermal radiation, Rahbari et al. [69] on the flow of blood model as third grade non-Newtonian, Sandeep et al. [76] on Jeffrey and Oldroyd-B nanofluids, Qayyum et al. [82] on tangent-hyperbolic nanofluid, and Khan et al. [83] on Maxwell non-Newtonian nanofluid. As shown in Fig. 2, it is seen that thermophoresis increases the concentration of non-Newtonian fluid flow. Maximum increase in the concentration due to thermophoresis is found in the case of passively controlled Casson nanofluid in the presence of thermal radiation by Vijayaragavan [66]. It is worth remarking that there exists a significance difference in the effect of thermophoresis on Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid flows. The outcome of the meta-analysis illustrated as Fig. 3 shows that local skin friction is a decreasing property of various fluid flow with thermophoresis. It is worth remarking in the study by Chamkha et al. [43] and Gorla and Khan [50] that local skin friction coefficient is a decreasing property of thermophoresis. This can be traced to Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation that was employed. The other report by Mondal and Pal [86] where thermophoresis significantly decreases friction between the wall and the adjacent fluid can be traced to the combination of Talbolt model and Buongiorno model for studying thermophoresis, which is not really appropriate. The results of Avinash et al. [75] shows that skin fiction coefficients is an increasing property of thermophoresis. Physically, this can be traced to the existence of inclined magnetic field of strength which is non-zero.\nIt is observed in the report by Bakier and Gorla [44], Uddin et al. [51], Vijaya and Mallikarjuna [59], and Avinash et al. [92] that Nusselt number which is proportional to heat transfer rate is an increasing property of thermophoresis parameter when the magnitude of Biot number is large (i.e. non-uniformity of temperature distribution within the fluid domain is ascertained) and that of Brownian motion is small (haphazard motion of tiny particle is minimized), thermal radiation is strong in nature and the porous surface is wavy. In addition, the report by Khan and Pop [41] shows clearly that, indeed, maximum Nusselt number is ascertained whenever haphazard motion of tiny particle is minimized. Heat transfer rate can also be negligibly maximized when momentum diffusivity dominates the flow (i.e. the magnitude of Prandtl number\n-0.3 -0.25 -0.2 -0.15 -0.1 -0.05 0 0.05 0.1\nChamkha et al. [43]\nBakier and Gorla [44]\nBakier and Gorla [44]\nGorla and Khan [50]\nGorla and Khan [50]\nShehzad et al. [56]\nAvinash et al. [75]\nMondal and Pal [86]\nSlope linear Regression through the data points for Skin Friction Coefficients\nFig. 3: Forest plot of the effects of thermophoresis on Skin Friction Coeff.\nis large). Decreasing effect of thermophoresis on the thermophoretic deposition, in the presence of buoyancy is more negligibly enhanced than in its absentia; see Chamkha and Pop [38] and Postelnicu [39]. As established by Bakier and Gorla [44], for the case where thermal radiation is highly significant, thermophoresis is seen to be a mode of increasing thermophoretic deposition; see Fig. 4. On Bejan number, Makinde and Eegunjobi [81] reported that it can be decreased due to thermophoresis. The outcome of this study shows in Fig. 5 that different responses to the force of temperature gradient are sufficient enough to enhance the temperature distribution due to an increase in thermophoresis. Exceptional cases are that of Vijaya and Mallikarjuna [59] due to the omission of convective acceleration in the momentum equation due to infinite wavy vertical porous surface, Subba et al. [88] due to the motion of Casson fluid induced by thermal slip, and Hosseinzadeh et al. [89] due to squeezing of the nanofluid. In addition, it is evident in the study carried out by Bakier [42], Bakier and Gorla [44], Vijaya and Mallikarjuna [59], Mishra et al. [64], Rahbari et al. [69], and Babu et al. [73] that velocity is an increasing function of thermophoresis parameter. Practically speaking, in all these reports, velocity increases due to an increase in the temperature which is inevitable. In other words, the observed increase in the velocity can be traced to the formation of relatively particle-free layer near the surface since thermophoresis tends to blow nanoparticles away from the surface. Also, decrease in the velocity function is seen when the effect of energy flux caused by composition gradient and/or mass flux created by a temperature gradient are also imposed together with thermophoresis; see Animasaun [20], Alam [70], and Mondal and Pal [86].\nRecently, the significance of water conveying 29 nm CuO and 47 nm Al2O3 nanoparticles on a horizontal paraboloid of revolution subject to quartic autocatalytic chemical reaction was presented by Animasaun [100]. The effects of thermophoresis on the flow when 0.1 ≤ Nt ≤ 0.5 and 1 ≤ Nt ≤ 5 were explained explicitly. When the rate of haphazard motion of nanoparticles is negligible and considerably significant, thermophoresis has no effect on the velocities (i.e. along x−direction and y−direction), shear stress (i.e. friction between any successive layers of the fluid), temperature distribution, and temperature gradient. For 0.1 ≤ Nt ≤ 0.5, in the flow\n-0.02 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08\nChamkha and Pop [39]\nChamkha and Pop [39]\nPostelnicu [40]\nPostelnicu [40]\nBakier and Gorla [44]\nBakier and Gorla [44]\nEffect of thermophoresis on thermophoretic deposition when modified Prandtl number is small\nEffect of thermophoresis on thermophoretic deposition\nwhen modified Prandtl number is large\n1 0.07rmP − =\n1 0.05rmP − =\nSlope linear Regression through the data points for thermophoretic deposition\nFig. 4: Forest plot of the effects of thermophoresis on the thermophoretic deposition.\n-0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\nSubba et al.

      "heading" : "5. Concluding Remark",
      "text" : "Owing to the validation of future results and enhancement of empirical review, this report presents the outcome of meta-analysis and scrutinization of thermophoresis effects on the flow of various fluids. Based on the outcome of the theoretical/conceptual and systematic review procedure of all the relevant published reports on the thermo-migration of tiny/nano-sized\nparticles in the motion of various fluids, it can be concluded that the formation of a relatively particle-free layer near the surface after blowing away of tiny particles due to thermophoresis is a major factor why concentration decreases with thermophoresis. Whenever energy flux caused by a composition gradient or mass flux created by a temperature gradient is considered, the effect of thermophoresis should be ignored. Different responses to the force of a temperature gradient are sufficient enough to enhance the temperature distribution due to an increase in thermophoresis. Effect of thermophoresis on the concentration of Newtonian fluid flow decreases while that of non-Newtonian fluid increases."

    "abstractText" : "The importance of thermophoresis and its essential role in particle migration have led to many published reports (i.e. aim and objectives). However, there exists no report on thermomigration of tiny/nano-sized particles in the motion of various fluids. A meta-analysis on the significance of either nano or tiny particles exposed to thermophoretic force owing to temperature gradient during the dynamics of liquid substances is deliberated upon in this report. The method of slope linear regression through the data point was adopted to scrutinize sixty (60) published reports in which the effects of thermophoresis (thermodiffusion) is deliberated upon. The outcome of the study shows that different responses to the force of a temperature gradient are sufficient enough to enhance the temperature distribution and the concentration of non-Newtonian fluid due to an increase in thermophoresis. Thermophoretic effect increases the concentration of fluids in which the relationship between the shear stress and shear strain is non-linear. Skin friction coefficients is a decreasing function of thermophoresis. Increase in thermophoretic deposition is achievable due to an increase in thermophoresis. The effect of haphazard motion of nanoparticles should be investigated when it increases negligibly and considerably large. Thermal radiation strongly influences the significance of thermo-migration of tiny particles on fluid flow.",
