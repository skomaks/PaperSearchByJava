It has become a subject of increasing importance as new fungi and their associated biomolecules are identified. The interaction between fungi and their environment is central to many natural processes that occur in the biosphere. The hosts and habitats of these eukaryotic microorganisms are very diverse; fungi are present in every ecosystem on Earth. The fungal kingdom is equally diverse, consisting of seven different known phyla. Yet detailed knowledge is limited to relatively few species. The relationship between fungi and humans has been characterized by the juxtaposed viewpoints of fungi as infectious agents of much dread and their exploitation as highly versatile systems for a range of economically important biotechnological applications. Understanding the biology of different fungi in diverse ecosystems as well as their interactions with living and non-living is essential to underpin effective and innovative technological developments. This series will provide a detailed compendium of methods and information used to investigate different aspects of mycology, including fungal biology and biochemistry, genetics, phylogenetics, genomics, proteomics, molecular enzymology, and biotechnological applications in a manner that reflects the many recent developments of relevance to researchers and scientists investigating the Kingdom Fungi. Rapid screening techniques based on screening specific regions in the DNA of fungi have been used in species comparison and identification, and are now being extended across fungal phyla. The majorities of fungi are multicellular eukaryotic systems and therefore may be excellent model systems by which to answer fundamental biological questions. A greater understanding of the cell biology of these versatile eukaryotes will underpin efforts to engineer certain fungal species to provide novel cell factories for production of proteins for pharmaceutical applications. Renewed interest in all aspects of the biology and biotechnology of fungi may also enable the development of “one pot” microbial cell factories to meet consumer energy needs in the 21st century. To realize this potential and to truly understand the diversity and biology of these eukaryotes, continued development of scientific tools and techniques is essential. As a professional reference, this series will be very helpful to all people who work with fungi and should be useful both to academic institutions and research teams, as well as to teachers, and graduate and postgraduate students with its information on the continuous developments in fungal biology with the publication of each volume.\nMore information about this series at http://www.springer.com/series/11224\nAjar Nath Yadav • Shashank Mishra Divjot Kour • Neelam Yadav • Anil Kumar Editors\nAgriculturally Important Fungi for Sustainable Agriculture Volume 2: Functional Annotation for Crop Protection\nISSN 2198-7777 ISSN 2198-7785 (electronic) Fungal Biology ISBN 978-3-030-48473-6 ISBN 978-3-030-48474-3 (eBook) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-48474-3\n© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020 This work is subject to copyright.

Sustainable agriculture requires limited use of harmful chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Among diverse groups of microbes, soil and plant fungal communities play an important role in plant growth, development, and soil health. The beneficial fungal communities help to promote plant growth directly or indirectly via different plant growth-promoting mechanisms viz: releasing plant growth regulators; solubilization of phosphorus, potassium and zinc; biological nitrogen fixation or by producing siderophores, ammonia, HCN and other secondary metabolites. The plant growth promoting fungal communities with multifunctional PGP attributes could be used as biofertilizers and biocontrol agents replacing chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the environmental as eco-friendly agents for sustainable agriculture and environment. Fungal communities possess a huge sink of capability by which they act as bioprotectants and biostimulants as well as for mitigation of different abiotic stress in plants. The utilization of beneficial soil and plant fungal resources will surely support sustainable agriculture. The present book on “Agriculturally Important Fungi for Sustainable Agriculture, Volume 2: Functional Annotation for Crop Protection” covers soil- and plant-associated fungal communities and their role in plant growth promotion, and crop productivity for sustainable agriculture. This book will be immensely useful to the biological sciences, especially to microbiologists, microbial biotechnologists, biochemists, researchers, and scientists dealing with fungal biotechnology. We have the honour that the leading scientists who have extensive, in-depth experience and expertise in plant-microbe interaction and fungal biotechnology took the time and\nvi\nmade efforts to contribute these outstanding chapters. Each chapter is written by internationally recognized researchers and scientists so that the readers are given an up-to-date and detailed account of our knowledge of fungal biotechnology and its innumerable agricultural applications.\nSirmour, Himachal Pradesh, India Ajar Nath Yadav Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India Shashank Mishra Baru Sahib, Sirmour, India Divjot Kour Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, India Neelam Yadav Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India Anil Kumar\nPreface\nvii"

      "heading" : "1.1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Fungi are one of the most important pathogens of crop plants in agriculture and forestry but they are also used as potential biocontrol agents to prevent and control plant disease. In recent years, the development of fungi for biocontrol of diseases, pests, and weeds has received a significant amount of interest among the community of scientists and researchers (Rangel et al. 2018). Public concerns on the usage of pesticides in the agricultural field and their effect on the environment are increasing day by day. Many fungi are being developed and mass produced as a commercially available biocontrol agents and are used in agriculture to promote the growth of plant and increase plant defense mechanism (Vega et al. 2009) as well as to control plant disease (Costa et al. 2012), terrestrial weeds (Monteiro, AC, Machado 2012). These biocontrol agents can also control and reduce aquatic weeds, plant-parasitic nematodes (Siddiqui and Mahmood 1996), and insects (Alston et  al. 2005; Li et al. 2010).\nRecent study in agricultural system on the role of Arbuscular mycorrhiza suggests that they can improve salinity tolerance and drought tolerance of their host plant by increasing the nutrient uptake, accumulation of organic solutes, and reducing the oxidative stress as a result of enhanced activity of catalase, peroxidase, calmodulin, superoxide dismutase, and ascorbate peroxidase (Abdel Latef and Chaoxing 2014; Chandrasekaran et al. 2014; Huang et al. 2014). An important role in stress tolerance is enhanced by symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi in both forest and agricultural ecosystems by improving nutrient uptake and drought tolerance and restricting base cation leaching as well as by mitigating the toxic effects of aluminum and other heavy metals (Finlay 2008; Finlay et al. 2009; Yadav 2017, 2019b).\nThe non-mycorrhizal fungi such as Trichoderma are well known for mediating stress reactions in plants and have the potential to parasitize or antagonize plant pathogenic fungi by stimulating the defense response and increasing the plant growth (Druzhinina et al. 2011; Sharma et al. 2019). The other fungi species such as Piriformospora indica induce disease resistance, tolerate salt stress, and promote the growth of crops through their capacity of glutathione ascorbate cycle mediated antioxidation activity (Waller et al. 2005). The enhancement of plant growth utilizing plant bio-stimulants and to access novel molecules by exploiting the fungal stress response to be used in agriculture is of current interest (Calvo et al. 2014; Yadav 2018).\nEndophytic microbes specifically endophytic fungi are those that have established an equilibrium with their host during the evolution and are recognized as a potential source of a wide variety of bioactive secondary metabolites (Rana et al. 2019a; Tan and Zou 2001; Sonaimuthu et  al. 2010; Gangadevi and Muthumary 2008). Their relationship with the host plant can vary from bordering on the pathogen to symbiotic. They adopt a different type of symbiosis such as facultative saprobic, exploitative, parasitic, and mutualistic (Clay and Schardl 2002). In most cases, the plant hosts are benefited by asymptomatic relationship. However in few cases they may exhibit beneficial or pathogenic effects (Photita et  al. 2001; Wei\nP. Selvasekaran and R. Chidambaram\n3 et al. 2007; Neubert et al. 2006) Few endophytic fungi exhibit mutualistic relationship with single plant species and not with the other plant species whereas some species have the potential to associate with wide range of plant host as well as association of endophyte with specific host tissue has also been reported (Hardoim et al. 2015; Yadav et al. 2020d). Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous and have been found in the majority of plant species that have been studied to date (Rana et al. 2019b; Yadav et al. 2019b). However, the literature available on the association between few plant host and endophytic fungi is limited and has to be explored further (Brundrett 2007).\nEndophytic fungi by secreting selected secondary metabolites have found to be associated with the plants to promote growth (Dai et al. 2008), protect from insects and disease (Wilkinson et al. 2000; Tanaka et al. 2005), and improve stress resistance (Lewis 2004). These secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi also have been identified as the source of antidiabetic, insecticidal, anticancer, immunosuppressive, and biocontrol compounds. These novel compounds help as remedies with their valuable biological and chemical characteristics for the health problems of plants, animals, and humans. The fungal endophytes have been represented as “chemical synthesizer inside the plant” because of the production of a variety of these useful chemical compounds (Yadav et al. 2020b, c).\nFungal diversity on earth is contributed significantly by endophytic fungi (Photita et al. 2001). Their biological distribution and diversity are massive in tropical rainforest and temperate zone. The detection of novel compounds from this group of fungi is extensively studied to investigate their potential to be used in pharmaceutical, medical, industrial, and agricultural sectors. A noteworthy discovery is the use of these compounds in agriculture as a biocontrol agent (Mane and Vedamurthy 2018). Fungal endophytes contribute to the fitness of plants by enabling the adaption of plant host to abiotic and biotic stresses. They establish a symbiotic relationship between their hosts and confer disease and pest resistance to host by enhancing their fitness, increasing the growth to resist stresses to the maximum extent, and promote the production of secondary metabolites (Gautam and Avasthi 2019; Rastegari et al. 2020a). Therefore, the use of fungi for the purpose of sustainable agriculture is of major interest."

      "text" : "Biofertilizers are an important source of essential nutrients for plants and crops. They are inexpensive and eco-friendly. They play a vital role in improving the nutrient status of soil, increase soil fertility, and, thus, crop productivity. Biofertilizers are the formulation of living microbes including bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi (Kour et al. 2020d). They can be applied directly to plant roots, soil, seed, and seedlings. Due to their inherent biological activity of the microorganisms, they help in mobilization and accessibility of nutrients (Pal et al. 2015). Fungal biofertilizers can be applied alone or in combination to the natural fields and can be beneficial directly\n1 Agriculturally Important Fungi for Crop Protection\n4 or indirectly to plant development, yield, and growth through various methods (Rai et al. 2013; Yadav et al. 2019c). The roots of herbs, trees, xerophytes, epiphytes, aquatics, shrubs, trees, aquatics, hydrophytes, and terrestrial plants are reported to develop mycorrhizal associations when grown with the insufficient availability of essential elements such as zinc, phosphorus, nitrogen, iron, sulfur, boron, and copper (Rastegari et al. 2020b; Singh and Yadav 2020).\nFungal biofertilizers that solubilize phosphate are the biological agents that are commonly employed for improving the growth and development of plants by enhancing the phosphorus uptake. The phosphate solubilizing property of fungi contributes significantly to the soil phosphate availability to plants. Several fungi have phosphate solubilizing property, the most common are Saccharomycopsis schoenii, Cryptococcus luteolus, Trichosporon beigelii, Rhodotorula aurantiaca A, Kluyveromyces walti, Neosartorya fisheri var. fischeri, Candida montana, Penicillium purpurogenum var. rubrisclerotium, and Zygoascus hellenicus (Birhanu et al. 2017). The fungi that solubilize phosphate belonging to the genera Fusarium, Aspergillus, Penicillium sp. are also found in the rhizospheric region of various plants.\nThe fungal genera of Penicillium, Chaetomium, and Aspergillus are of widespread occurrence (Yadav et al. 2018, 2019c). The commonly employed fungi for the production of biofertilizer are Trichoderma which is predominantly present in agricultural soils. The rhizosphere inhabited by Trichoderma species can also interact and parasitize with other fungi. These species have long been recognized as they enhance crop nutrition, nutrient acquisition, and augment plant productivity. The metabolites produced by these species serve as a fungicide against the fungal pathogens that cause disease (Harman et al. 2008; Chang 1986; Vinale et al. 2009). The utilization of Trichoderma as a culture filtrate and its inoculation in soil enhances biomass production and plant growth. The application of this fungus as a model organism is feasible as they are easy to cultivate under laboratory conditions for the evaluation of beneficial interaction between plants and microbes. They can be used as a novel tool to enhance the productivity of plants (Varma et al. 2012)."

The major factor responsible for 10–30% of annual crop productivity loss is plant disease. In spite of the development of water management practice, an agricultural practice that has posed to be the effective management of plant disease, new techniques in agronomy, the development of disease-resistant varieties, there are still pathogens for which the synthetic chemicals are broadly used for the management of the disease (Kour et al. 2019b; Yadav et al. 2020a). The attractive choice of using the biocontrol agent against different pathogens has emerged as the most common and significant factor responsible for the death of insects in a large populations (Villa et al. 2017). Several postharvest diseases are biologically balanced using fungal species that have antagonist properties. The worldwide scientist is attracted by this area of research. The components of the biocontrol system are influenced by various factors such as UV light, temperature, pH, as well as abiotic and biotic stresses (Kumar et  al. 2019a, b; Yadav 2019a). The biocontrol agent preparation is significantly affected by various abiotic stress factors which lead to modification of functionality. Therefore, knowledge on the survivability of biocontrol agents under certain environmental conditions and the development of the procedure to make the biocontrol agent resist stress tolerance is required to maintain their commercial exploitation and effectiveness. The experimental studies on various biocontrol agents on different plant species have been studied to understand their reaction under varied environmental conditions (Sui et al. 2015) (Table 1.2).\n1 Agriculturally Important Fungi for Crop Protection\n6 Ta bl e 1. 1 Fu ng al b io fe rt ili ze rs f or c ro p pr ot ec tio n an d su st ai na bl e ag ri cu ltu re L is t o f ag ri cu ltu ra lly im po rt an t f un ga l b io fe rt ili ze r R ef er en ce Z in c so lu bi li zi ng b io fe rt il iz er • E ri co id m yc or rh iz a (o id io de nd ro n m ai us ) • P en ic il li um s im pl ic is si m um • S ac ch ar om yc es s pp . • A sp er gi ll us n ig er M ar tin o et  a l.

Fungal endophytes obtain nutrition, propagation opportunities, protection and shelter from their host by internal plant tissue colonization. This symbiotic relationship helps the host by promoting the overall health and reducing environmental sensitivity. The best offer to the control of chemical disease is the use of endophytes (Yao et al. 2017).

An in-depth\n1 Agriculturally Important Fungi for Crop Protection\n8 understanding of the mechanism involved in the association of plants and fungal endophytes is of major interest to optimize the efficacy as well as for the registration of products that are used for plant protection (Rana et al. 2019a; Suman et al. 2016; Yadav et al. 2018). The possible mechanism that is considered to be adopted by the fungal endophytes against the pathogens may be mycoparasitism, induction, antibiosis, direct and indirect inhibition, competition, and improvement of host plant resistance (Yu et al. 2010; Nisa et al. 2015; Gautam and Avasthi 2019).

Some researchers have proposed a few possible mechanisms by the use of fungal endophytes and their secondary metabolites to suppress the pathogens (Yadav et  al. 2017b, c). However, the knowledge on the mechanism between plant, endophyte, and pathogen is to be explored further. In direct mechanism fungal endophytes secrete lytic enzymes and produce antibiotics or the pathogens are directly suppressed through antibiosis, mycoparasitism, and competition (Bamisile et al. 2018; Mejía et al. 2008; Ganley et al. 2008; Gautam and Avasthi 2019)."

The plant pathogenic fungi are often attacked by these fungi that act as mycoparasites either to inhibit or suppress their growth. One of the most popular examples of mycoparasitism is Trichoderma. Prior to making any contact, Trichoderma detects the fungal pathogen and the extracellular exochitinase is produced in lower levels and discharges the oligomers of cell wall from the target fungus (Harman et  al. 2004). This mechanism initiates the Trichoderma to release toxic endochitinase that can degrade the target plant-fungal pathogen. The hyphae of the plant pathogens including Rhizoctonia solani is parasitized by the Trichoderma species (Grosch et al. 2006). A novel endophytic fungus Acremonium strictum isolated from Dactylis glomerate has been reported (Rivera-Varas et al. 2007) for the activity of mycoparasitism against Helminthosporium solani. In the process of mycoparasitism the binding of chemical compounds between the host fungus and mycoparasite occurs initially. One such example is binding of lecithin in the cell wall of the host fungi to the carbohydrate present in the cell wall of Trichoderma. Later the establishment of contact with the host fungus is inhabited by the hyphae of the mycoparasite. Several\nP. Selvasekaran and R. Chidambaram\n9 lytic enzymes are involved along with the mechanisms in the cell wall degradation of the host fungi (Cao et al. 2009). These findings have proven that the pest damage in the agricultural crops can be limited by the mycoparasitic activity of the endophytic fungi and can prove to be a potential alternative to the use of chemical pesticides (Gautam and Avasthi 2019)."

The effect on traditional rice varieties by the most frequently isolated endophytic fungi on the growth of plant and incidence of blast disease was evaluated by Atugala and Deshappriya (2015). The study concluded that a range of mechanisms of antagonistic activity was utilized by the endophytic fungi including the competition for antibiosis, substrate, and mycoparasitism.

The single or multiple kinds of antibiotics which has been proven to be effective has been reported to be produced by single fungus including aromatic compounds, polypeptides, terpenoids, and alkaloids. Researchers (Mejía et al. 2008; Wei et al. 2007) have been carrying out the examination of antibiotic compounds produced by endophytic fungi and have proven that the plants inoculated with endophytic fungi induce the defense mechanism in the host plant. It has been determined that the cultures of endophytic fungi possess the antibiotic properties against several plant pathogens after a series of tests involving liquid broths of endophytic fungi. It was also reported by Atugala and Deshappriya (2015); Kim et al.

It has been reported that the endophytic fungi produce secondary metabolites to protect the host plant from disease and pest (Sudha et  al. 2016). These bioactive compounds serve as mediators for specific communication and interaction with the host plant. The competition, fitness, and growth of the host plant are triggered by the endopytic fungi upon production of the secondary metabolites that inhibit the pathogens.

The endophytic colonization of the host plant improves the uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other essential nutrients and enhances the metabolic activity such as physiological functions and increases the growth of plant (Bolton 2009).

During the endophytism certain protein that acts as pathogenicity related proteins is produced that are reported to suppress the activity of plant pathogen (Li et al. 2004). The promotion of plant growth enhanced by the fungal endophytes is another benefit that enhances the capacity of the plant to develop resistance against various pathogens. The study on the ability of fungal endophytes to induce resistance among host plants was done by many researchers. The barley plants are reported to be resistant against Blumeria graminis, Fusarium culmorum, leaf and vascular pathogens that are inoculated with Piriformospora indica. They also\nP. Selvasekaran and R. Chidambaram\n15\nexhibited an increase in tolerance towards salt stress. The endophytic fungi such as Colletotrichum sp. and Cryptosporiopsis cf. quercina are reported to be effective against various phytopathogens such as Gaeumannomyces graminis, Rhizoctonia cerealis, Pyricularia oryzae, and Phytophthora capsici (Lu et  al. 2000b). The Festuca rubra L., when inoculated with the endophyte Epichloe festucae the induced resistance was observed against Sclerotinia homoeocarpa which causes dollar spot disease (Clarke et al. 2006)."

Hence, the requirement for the use of chemical pesticides to prevent and control numerous foliar phytopathogens that have a high rate of sporulation is reduced. They are well suited for widespread dissemination as airborne propagules. • The beneficial microbes are affected by the use of synthetic chemicals although they inhibit pathogens. During the treatment with pesticide, the effective root nodule formation with the nitrogen-fixing bacteria is decreased and inhibited. This proves endophytic fungi as a potential alternative over synthetic chemicals. • The systemic fungicide increases the chance of fungicide resistance by pathogens though they help in the control of plant pathogens. The fungal endophytes manage these pathogens in a better way and reduce the development of resistance by pathogens. • The requirement of farmers on the synthetic chemical is reduced by the use of fungal endophytes thereby reducing the exposure of user and environment to the synthetic chemicals that are harmful. • The use of endophytic fungi as a biocontrol agent, an eco-friendly and costeffective method when compared to all the other methods.

      "heading" : "1.5 Arbuscular Mycorrhizae and Its Role in Agriculture",
      "text" : "The term mycorrhizae was derived from the Greek words mycos and rhiza which means fungus and root, respectively (Wang and Qiu 2006). Mycorrhiza is categorized into arbuscular, ectendo, ecto, ericoid, abutoid, monotropoid, and orchid mycorrhiza. One of the most effective microorganisms involved in the stabilization of soil structure is Arbuscular mycorrhiza (SWABY 1949; Miller and Jastrow 2000). They are economically important types of microorganisms and are exploited\n1 Agriculturally Important Fungi for Crop Protection\n16\ncommercially in forestry and agriculture. Arbuscular mycorrhiza is a monophyletic lineage of obligate mycobionts (Schwarzott et al. 2001). They form symbiotic associations with plant roots belonging to phylum Glomeromycota (Owen et al. 2015). About 80–90% of extant plant species are mycorrhizal as phylum is an ancient form of symbiosis in plants. Mycorrhiza penetrates the root cell walls of plants and develops arbuscules, hypae, and vesicles (intra-radical structures) in the cortical cells of the host and hyphae and spores (extra radical structures) in soil. Bidirectional flux characterizes the mutualistic association whereas the acquisition of soil nutrients in phytobiont is enhanced by mycobiont while the phytobiont provides carbon sources (photo assimilates) to the mycobiont (Buscot et al. 2000; Brundrett 2009). The ability of Arbuscular fungi to form hyphae for nutrient uptake with highly favorable surface area to volume ratio and to secrete enzymes and organic acids is due to the mutualistic association (Owen et al. 2015).\nThe interaction between plants and microbes has a major impact on the functioning of the plant and ecology of the plant community (Boon et al. 2014; Vimal et al. 2017). Mycorrhiza along with plant root hairs increases soil-root contact area as they are the vital components at the soil–root interface through their extra radical hyphae. Hence, they improve plant nutrient uptake mainly phosphate (Jakobsen et al. 2005; Bucher 2007), iron (Treeby and Bag 1992), calcium (Azcón and Barea 1992), manganese, nitrogen, and zinc. Arbuscular mycorrhiza is also beneficial to improve the nutrient acquisition of plants in soils with a low fertility rate. They serve as a substitute for reduced fertilizer input and lead to sustainable agriculture (Galvez et al. 2001).\nThe beneficial attributes to host by Arbuscular mycorrhiza include:\n• Increased plant tolerance to salinity, drought, and metal pollution (abiotic stress) and pathogenic infection, herbivory (biotic stress) (Augé 2004) • Increases plant growth and development by improving the rooting of micropropagated plantlets. • They contribute to plant nutrition acquisition by influencing the chemical and microbial ecology of the mycorrhizosphere (Azcón and Barea 1992) • In a disturbed ecosystem, they help to improve energy flow, nutrient cycling, and plant establishment. • The symbiosis by Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi helps to stimulate the synthesis of secondary plant metabolites which are essential for the plants to tolerate environmental induced stresses and beneficial to human beings through their antioxidant activity and protective nutrient compounds. • They enhance plant diversity as they interconnect several individual and unrelated plant species • Arbuscular mycorrhiza enhances the soil bioremediation as they are involved in phytoremediation-use of plants for the uptake of pollutants. They are beneficial in revegetation and restoration of contaminated and disturbed areas as they help in alleviating toxicity of metals to plants by reducing the translocation of metal from the root to shoot.\nP. Selvasekaran and R. Chidambaram\n17\n• Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae improve the soil stability, water retention, and binding property through the extra radical mycelial network and secretion of glomalin which is a hydrophobic proteinaceous substance.\n1.6 Penicillium and Its Role as Plant Growth Promotion\nPenicillium as an ascomycetous fungus is a genus which is significant for the production of food and drug in the environment. In the human body, the antibiotic penicillin produced by Penicillium restricts the spreading of certain bacteria. Penicillium belongs phylogenetically to Trichocomaceae and is an anamorph genus (Berbee et al. 1995; Samson 2016). The name Penicillium is derived from the word penicillus which means little brush. It has been reported that Penicillium spp. intermingles with the roots of plants and crops to enhance their growth (Shivanna et al. 1994; Khan et  al. 2008). Several plant hormones such as gibberellins (GA), indole-3acetic acid (IAA) are secreted by this fungus and are involved in phosphate solubilization (Khan et al. 2008, 2011; Radhakrishnan et al. 2013).\nPenicillium species are widely spread in nature across various soil environments such as dessert soil, cultivated soil, beach soil, forest soil, and marine habitats (Chandanie et al. 2006). Penicillium species are of great interest to researchers as they secrete herbicides, insecticides, antibiotics, mycotoxins, antioxidants, anticancer compounds, and extracellular enzymes (Munns and Tester 2008). The production of phytohormones such as gibberellins, auxin, cytokinin, solubilization of minerals and antagonism against phytopathogens are the key mechanism involved in promoting plant growth by Penicillium species (Volpin et al. 1995). The phosphorus uptake, growth, and yield of several crops such as pomegranate, sesame, and wheat are promoted by the inoculation of Penicillium species with PGP in soil. The upregulation of IAA which is a plant growth-promoting phytohormone during stress conditions promotes plant growth (Faeth and Fagan 2002).\nIt has been reported that under oxidative stress Sesamum indicum L. treated with Penicillium showed a significant increase in IAA. The species of Penicillium and Phoma glomerata produce gibberellins and IAA to promote the growth of the host plant under the condition of abiotic stress. The phytohormone gibberellins regulate various physiological processes such as fruit set, floral development, flowering, seed germination, and shoot growth (Khan et al. 2011). The level of GA is increased in host plants with the help of the endophytic Penicillium population under abiotic stresses such as heat, heavy metals, and salinity. The production of GA by various species of Penicillium has been reported such as P. funiculosum under drought and salinity (Waqas et al. 2012), P. janthinellum LK5 under the stress of cadmium toxicity (Khan et al. 2013), and P. resedanum under drought, heat, and salinity (Khan et al. 2013).\n1 Agriculturally Important Fungi for Crop Protection\n18"

      "heading" : "1.6.1 The Role of Penicillium Under Abiotic Conditions",
      "text" : "The tolerance of host plants against various pathogens and metal toxicity is provided by Penicillium. The tolerance in host plants against metal toxicity can be enhanced by different strains of Penicillium. The strains of Penicillium simplicissimum and Penicillium janthinellum synthesize citric acid and are known to reduce zinc and aluminum toxicity (Zhang et al. 2002). Similarly, the cadmium content is reduced by the strains of Penicillium species obtained from the polluted industrial sediments (Massaccesi et al. 2002). Studies on the potential of Solanum lycopersicum against cadmium toxicity proved that the metal toxicity can be mitigated by Penicillium species by the synthesis of enzymes and various other bioactive metabolites. Plants under cadmium stress are addressed through the complexation and compartmentation (Mazid et al. 2011). Sulfur is one of the most significant nutrients for plants along with a component of glutathione which is considered to be active in the detoxification of heavy metals (Howden et  al. 1995). Under the exposure to cadmium and Pencillium, the glutathione and the sulfur content of the root increased. The sulfur content is enhanced by treatment with Penicillium that increases the synthesis of glutathione required for the synthesis of phytochelatin (Rüegsegger et al. 1990). The calcium content under cadmium stress increases by the treatment of Penicillium.\nIn the plant growth, calcium plays an essential role and is a key molecule in the signal transduction under biotic and abiotic stress conditions (White and Broadley 2003). The plants need to reduce the peroxidation of lipids in the cell membrane and enhance their capacity to intake nutrients and antioxidant activities to reduce the effects of metal toxicity and to increase the plant yield (Siddiqui et al. 2011). The potential of antioxidant activity of plants against cadmium is stimulated by the Penicillium janthinellum and lowers the content of cadmium in roots as well as protects the plant from electrolytic leakage induced by cadmium. The plant generates ROS due to the membrane damage caused by the cadmium injury and releases the product MDA resulting in from the breakdown of aldehydic lipid in the membrane. The plants treated with Penicillium during cadmium stress have significantly less MDA indicating less injury to the functional membrane. Studies have shown that osmotic stress is induced by drought and salinity stress which is transmitted through the abscisic acid-dependent and the abscisic acid-independent pathways (Mauch-Mani and Mauch 2005; Cao et al. 2014). It has been observed that the synthesis of abscisic acid is low under stress and fungal treatment (Hause et al. 2007; Jahromi et al. 2008). The minimum effort is required by plants for the synthesis of abscisic acid and to control the movement of the guard cell under stress conditions as the water balance in the plant can be improved by Penicillium treatment. The exposure of the plant to stresses like cold and drought significantly increases the expression of the RAB18 gene while the heat shock suppresses the gene. However, in Penicillium-treated and salinity-stressed plant the mRNA of RAB18 accumulation is noted.\nP. Selvasekaran and R. Chidambaram\n19\nThe interaction of fungi and the production of phytohormone GA might have activated the expression of RAB18 (Ghelis et al. 2000). Similarly, the same results had been noted by the exogenous abscisic acid-induced RAB18 in the abscisic acid mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana (Ghelis et al. 2000). In plants treated with Penicillium the upregulation of RAB18 under salinity stress is due to the anionic channel activation during stomatal closure as confirmed by the increased ionic flux (Bray et al. 2000). The accumulation of abscisic acid is correlated with the increased\n1 Agriculturally Important Fungi for Crop Protection\n20\nelectrolytic flux which causes a reduction in the elongation of shoot, rate of photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, leaf area, development of flower and fruit. The treatment of plants with endophytic fungi P. janthinellum mitigates the negative effect as the plants synthesize abscisic acid in smaller amounts to deal with the stressful condition. This mechanism of growth promotion is related to the effects of exogenous GA3 treatment under stress (Hamayun et  al. 2010; Iqbal and Ashraf 2013) (Table 1.4).\n1.7 Trichoderma for Sustainable Agriculture\nThe species of Trichoderma suppresses the severity of disease by antagonizing the pathogens and improves the growth of the plant through different modes of actions through the combination of mechanisms such as the production of cell wall degrading enzymes, antibiotics, competition for growth production and key nutrients, stimulation of mechanism of plant defense, parasitism of host fungus, and induced systematic systemic resistance (Jayalakshmi et al. 2009).\nP.

The process of mycoparasitism is complex involving chemotrophic growth on the host by the antagonist, host recognition by the mycoparasite, attachment, and coiling of pathogen hyphae, excretion of extracellular enzymes followed by lysis and exploitation of host (Chet et al. 1990). The suppression of R. solani by T. lignorum was reported. The hyphal cell walls of the pathogen are lysed by enzymes such as\n1 Agriculturally Important Fungi for Crop Protection\n22\nproteases, chitinases, β-1,3-glucanases during the activity of mycoparasitism (De La Cruz et  al. 1992). The degradation of the cell wall, inhibition of mycelium growth, and spore germination of pathogenic plant fungi are associated with the properties of the enzyme, β-1,3-glucanases (Lin et al. 2007). The degradation of the pathogen cell wall and hyphal membranes and cell walls are reported (Grandgirard et al. 2002) to be associated with proteases produced by T. harzianum T-39. The hydrolytic enzymes, exogalacturonase, and endopolygalacturonase produced by Botrytis cinerea that reduces the severity of gray mold can be deactivated by the proteases.

Several species of Trichoderma and various other biological agents produce enormous antibiotics (Handelsman and Stabb 1996). The species of Trichoderma are also known to produce extracellular enzymes that are involved in biocontrol of plant pathogenic fungi (Monte 2001). It has been reported that T. lignorum produces a toxic substance called gliotoxin lethal to R. solani and Sclerotinia americana. But later it was found that gliotoxin was produced by Gliocladium virens and not T. lignorum (Webster and Lomas 1964). It has also been reported that the culture filtrate of T. harzianum inhibits the growth of F. longipes and F. solani by 74% and 60%, respectively.\nThe produced toxins suppressed the disease development by affecting the spore germination (fungistasis) and causing mortality to the cells (antibiosis). Trichoderma species produces antibiotics such as harzianic acid (Vinale et  al. 2013), viridian (Zafari et  al. 2008), gliotoxin (Anitha and Murugesan 2005), viridiol (Phuwapraisirisan et  al. 2006), alamethicins (Aidemark et  al. 2010), and several others (Goulard et al. 1995). The process of action of these antibiotics is synergized by combining with the enzymes that degrade the cell wall and by producing a strong inhibitory effect on the pathogens (Vinale et  al. 2008). T. harzianum produces Trichotoxin A50 that is reported (Suwan et al. 2000) to inhibit the growth of mycelium and sporangium produced by P. palmivora.

Trichoderma species are either added to the soil directly or as seed treatments and grow spontaneously along with the developing root system thereby protecting the plant against pathogens (Howell et al. 2000). The colonization of Chondrostereum purpureum, the pathogen of plum trees was suppressed by T. viride (Corke and Hunter 1979). The determination of the antagonism expressed by various strains of Trichoderma spp against F. oxysporum and several other plant pathogens involves competition for carbon (Sivan 1989). The Fusarium species on several different crops were controlled by T. harzianum T-35 through nutrient competition and colonization of the rhizosphere (Viterbo et al. 2007).

The induction of resistance mechanisms such as hypersensitive response induced systematic resistance and systematic acquired resistance protects the plants from pathogens when the strains of Trichoderma are added to the rhizosphere (Haggag 2008). Induced resistance has been observed by De Meyer et al. (1998); Koike et al. (2001) with an unidentified Trichoderma sp. on cucumber, T. harzainum on bean, and T. virens on cotton. The seedlings of cotton treated with the strains of T. virens (Howell et al. 2000) had a higher level of compounds such as terpenoids that are related to the mechanism of defense and higher peroxidase activity in the roots of the host plant. The peroxidase activity induced by T. virens has also been reported (Howell et al. 2000) in the seedlings of cotton more than in the control experiment. The production of phytoalexin in the cells of grapevine (Calderón et al. 1993) is elicited by ethylene-inducing xylanase produced by the T. viride. The stimulation of significantly higher terpenoid levels in cotton was noted in the culture filtrates of few effective strains of T. virens and the elicitors are mostly glycoproteins or proteins (Hanson and Howell 2004). The root inoculation of the cucumber seedling which is 7-day old in an aseptic hydroponic system with T. harzianum has been reported (Yedidia et al. 1999) to induce the response of defense in the leaves and roots of the treated plants.\nThe activation of systematic acquired resistance in plants correlates with the expression of pathogenesis-related genes such as acidic and basic β-1,3-glucanase and chitinase which acts against the cell wall of plant pathogen (Ferreira et  al. 2007). The systematic resistance induced by Trichoderma species in plants is phenotypically similar to that of systematic acquired resistance (Yedidia et al. 2000). The cellulase and xylanase derived from Trichoderma are well known in inducing the biosynthesis of ethylene (Martinez et al. 2001).

Sivan (1989) speculated that the growth promotion of plant may be due to the activity of the biocontrol fungus that reduces the concentration of plant growth inhibitory substances or increase the concentration of compounds that are related to the defense mechanism of plant. Thus, the growth promotion of plants may be due to the production of growth-promoting hormones or increased nutrient uptake by the plants (Sivan 1989).\nThe application of Trichoderma species can strengthen the defense mechanism of plants. It has been reported (Rabeendran et al. 2000) that by dipping transplants in spore suspensions (107 conidia/mL) of T. tomentosum and T. longipile can increase the surface area (58–71%), dry weight of root (100–158%), dry weight of shoot (91–102%) of cabbage.

In recent years species of Trichoderma have also been reported to solubilize phosphorus. A clear zone of phosphate solubilization was recorded by Saraf et al.

The 14 strains of Trichoderma species isolated from the rhizosphere of the forest tree such as deodar, bamboo, guava, pinus, and oak for their potential of in vitro solubilized phosphate in the culture broth containing tricalcium phosphate as the sole source of phosphate (Khan et al. 2008). The maximum amount of phosphate solubilization was shown by Trichoderma isolate DRT followed by T. harzianum after 96 h incubation period at 30 °C (Kapri and Tewari 2010). The phosphate solubilization under the environment of low temperature was induced by fungal root endophytes with maximum solubilization by T. pseudokongingii. Similarly, the solubilization of phosphorus from ten isolates of Trichoderma species derived from the rhizosphere has been reported (Saravanakumar et al. 2013).\nIn the evaluation of plant growth promotion among the 12 fungal endophytes, Chaetomium globosum, Fusarium fusarioides, mucor species, and Aspergillus versicolour showed the production of HCN.  Rawatand studied  T. virens (SE6 and KT28), Aspergillus flavus (BRT11), T. viride (KT6) for their potential of plant growth promotion  and indicated that only three isolates, SE6, KT6, and BRT11 showed the production of HCN (Rawat and Tewari 2011). During the isolation of six Trichoderma isolates for the potential of in vitro plant growth promotion only Trichoderma produced HCN. Colonization of root by the strains of Trichoderma frequently enhances the growth and development of root, abiotic stress resistance, productivity of the crop, uptake, and use of nutrients. After the addition of T. hamatum or T. koningii the productivity of crops in fields increased up to 300%.\nThe experiments that were carried out by treating the seeds with Trichoderma spores in greenhouses significantly showed greater yield. When the plant seeds were separated from Trichoderma by a cellophane membrane, they showed an equal degree of yield enhancement. This indicates the production of growth factors from Trichoderma that enhances seed germination, growth of the plant, and the yield. Besides having the inhibitory effect on the germ tube elongation and conidial germination of Botrytis cinerea, the T. harzianum T39 also reduces the production and activity of the pectolytic enzymes. The reduction in the activity of pectolytic enzymes can increase the accumulation of pectic enzymes that is oligogalacturonides. The host plant defense can be elicited by these sugars, thus checking the development of the disease.

In traditional agricultural practice, the effectiveness of the use of chemical or synthetic fertilizers is also significantly affected by drought (Saba 2012). Improvement in the stimulation of plant growth and soil fertility in the dry and drought areas is one of the major issues that farmers have been facing for decades. Few species such as T. harzianum, T.\nP. Selvasekaran and R.

Trichoderma species also help in sustaining the plants under drought conditions which are considered as biological methods. The interaction of the plant with Trichoderma species increases the yield, development, and stress tolerance in various conditions. These species occur almost in all the ecosystems and constitute one of the parts on the microflora of the rhizosphere. The alleviation of damage is induced by Trichoderma through reactive oxygen species, improvement in the efficiency of water use, and phytohormone secretion that enhances the growth of plants under drought stress (Khan and Mohiddin 2018).\nTrichoderma is considered a virulent organism that stimulates the growth of plant under the suboptimal conditions. The plant symbionts help in either inducing plants to scavenge ROS or by preventing the production of ROS under abiotic stress. Symbiotic plants spend significantly less water when compared to the non- symbiotic plants. Tomato and rice with the Trichoderma species used less fluid than the nonsymbiotic plants. Trichoderma protects the plants against ROS by increasing the ROS scavenging capacity. The antioxidative enzymes such as peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-reductase, and glutathione-S-transferase as well as other detoxifying enzymes present in leaves increase due to the inoculation of roots with Trichoderma species. The superoxide dismutase converts the toxic superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen through the dismutation reaction. The application of T. atroviride ID20G increases the fresh and dry weight of the roots of maize under the drought stress.\nBesides inducing the antioxidant enzyme activity, the fungal strains also increased the carotenoid and chlorophyll content of the seedlings. The colonization of root by T. atroviride ID20G prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation and also reversed the changes in the contents of pigment and efficiency of photosystem caused by drought. The seeds that are subjected to oxidative stress restored vigor after treatment with the Trichoderma T22. Furthermore, in cucumber plants, the peroxidase gene was primed after inoculation with Trichoderma species. In tomato seeds, the percentage of germination increased after the application of T. harzianum T22 under osmotic conditions. An increase in the content of lipid peroxide in young seedlings was reported in a study with an increase in the water potential of the media whereas the seedlings that are treated with T22 have significantly less lipid peroxide than the untreated seedlings (Khan and Mohiddin 2018).\n1.8 Piriformospora indica\nThe endophytic Agaricomycetes fungus Piriformospora indica owing to its exceptional ability to efficiently promote the growth of plant, protection, and tolerance to stress has received significant attention over the past few decades and mimics the capabilities of Arbuscular Mycorrhizae.

The root colonization by Piriformospora indica promotes plant performance and enhances the proliferation of root by the production of indole-3-acetic acid. The production of indole-3-acetic acid also improves the nutrient acquisition and improves the growth and productivity of the crop. Through the signal transduction pathway, this fungus can induce local and systemic resistance to viral and fungal plant disease. The plant stress tolerance is conferred through the stimulation of components involved in the defense mechanisms and expressing the genes related to stress by the P. indica. Therefore, micro-propagated plantlets can be biotized by this fungus as well as the transplantation shock can be overcome. P. indica can also be involved in various symbiotic relationships such as symbiosis of tripartite and promotes the rhizobacteria thereby enhancing the population dynamics of plant growth. Hence, Piriformospora indica has the potential to be utilized as a bio protector, bioregulator, biofertilizer, biotization agent, and plant growth promoter."

      "text" : "Phosphorus is one of the important essential nutrients. The phosphorus present in the soil cannot be directly accessed by the plants as the phosphorus is in the form of scarcely soluble complexes. Hence, the deficiency of phosphorus impedes the production of crops throughout the world. It was reported that the uptake of radiolabeled phosphorous from the culture media was mediated by the Piriformospora indica. The acid phosphatases are also produced by this fungus in significant amounts which helps the host plants to access insoluble, condensed, and complex forms of phosphate in the soil (Yadav et al. 2010). Isolation of high-affinity phosphate transporter, identification and characterization of their functional property from the root endophytic fungus P. indica revealed that the phosphate transporter is essential for the transport of phosphate to the host plants (Johri et al. 2015). The mechanism behind the transport of phosphate from fungus to plant is still not clear but the hypothesis states that it might occur at the plant-fungus interface. This process requires two transporters. The first transporter to enable the phosphate efflux from the fungus and the second transporter to mediate the uptake of phosphate by the plants (Rausch and Bucher 2002). The reports concerning the involvement of P. indica in the transfer of phosphate are contradictory. It has been reported that the phosphate uptake in Arabidopsis seedling is enhanced by Piriformospora indica 2–3 times higher (Shahollari et al. 2005). It has been reported by Yadav et al. (2010) on the influence of phosphate on the biomass of Z. mays plant that was colonized with P. indica. Increased biomass and total phenolic content were observed in the plants colonized with P. indica of wild type as compared with non-colonized (Yadav et al. 2010). The growth-promoting activity of P. indica was observed to be higher under the condition of low phosphate as compared with the condition under high phosphate. Hence it has been concluded that P. indica can be a potential agent for\nP. Selvasekaran and R.

This effect is activated by the enzyme that plays a significant role in the acquisition of nitrate, NADH-dependent nitrate reductase.

      "text" : "The growth, development, and yield of many crops, horticulture, and other medicinal plants were increased by the P. indica (Varma et al. 2012). In several crops seed germination and development induced by this fungus have been reported (Pham et al. 2008; Kumar et al. 2009; Vadassery et al. 2008). The enhanced seed development and production have been reported in A. thaliana as a result of microdomains present in the plasma membrane such as pii-2 and AT5g16590. The H. vulgare seeds inoculated with P. indica showed higher viability (Harrach et al. 2013). The germinated seeds under adverse conditions showed a higher survival rate when immersed in the homogenate containing P. indica. In vascular plants, the early seed germination is facilitated by the filtrate of P. indica. The seed oil yield from the Helianthus annuus was evidenced to be influenced by the culture filtrate of P. indica (Bagde et al. 2011). As a result of root colonization by P. indica the members of angiosperms, gymnosperms, bryophytes, and pteridophytes were reported to have higher seed yield. In medicinal plants the inoculation and colonization role of P. indica has been seen as utmost significance (Hock 2012).\nIn medicinal plants, the colonization by P. indica has been reported including Lantana camara, Coleus forskohlii, Linum album, Bacopa monnieri, Ocimum sanctum, Stevia rebaudiana, Chlorophytum borivilianum, Artemisia annua, Withania somnifera,, Linum album, Spilanthes calva, Trigonella foenumgraecum (Kumar et al. 2009; Das et al. 2014; Sharma and Agrawal 2013). In C. forskohlii increased content of secondary metabolites and chemical compounds have been reported due to the colonization of roots by P. indica (Das et al. 2014). The hypertrophy B. monnieri nuclei and the growth, the level of bacoside endogenous, and antioxidant\n1 Agriculturally Important Fungi for Crop Protection\n30\nactivity are enhanced by P. indica (Prasad et al. 2013). The properties of medicinal plants such as H. annuus, A. elegans, A. indica were increased by their colonization with P. indica (Bagde et al. 2011). In the cell culture of L. album the inoculation of P.  indica improved the anticancer drug podophyllotoxin. In the herbaceous plant such as A. annua and S. rebaudiana their leaf area and biomass were enhanced when cultivated with P. indica. The medicinal plants namely W. somnifera and S. calva were reported to have a positive impact on their growth in a field trial when inoculated with P. indica (Rai et al. 2001). In W. somnifera and A. annua the productivity of biomass was enhanced by in  vitro co-cultivation with the filtrate of P. indica (Baishya et al. 2015). In view of the colonization role of P. indica in crop plants, it has been reported that the enhanced growth and production of biomass have been observed in Ridax procumbans, Oryza sativa, Phaseolus vulgaris, Saccharum officinarum, Zea mays, Abrus precatorius (Varma et al. 2012). The plant root growth is promoted by P. indica due to their role in the production of auxin as well as their interaction with ethylene signaling. They stimulate the synthesis of the secondary metabolites such as betulinic acid, ursolic acid, oleanolic acid in the suspension culture of L. camara. Further, this fungus can be used as a biopriming agent due to its symbiotic effect on the overall growth of plant biomass (Gill et al. 2016)."

      "text" : "There has been an extensive report on the ability of Piriformospora indica to increase the tolerance capacity of plants against various abiotic stress including heavy metal toxicity, salinity, and low temperature. In Triticum aestivum and Arabidopsis seedlings, the colonization with P. indica mediated tolerance against high salinity and drought stress, respectively (Zarea et al. 2012; Sherameti et al. 2008). The activation of genes that are related to defense mechanisms such as LOX2, PR, and ERFI are reported (Zarea et al. 2012) to be activated by colonization with P. indica. The interaction of P. indica with the roots of A. thaliana can be used as a unique model system to study the symbiotic relationship. The ability to deliver molecules such as effectors has been evolved by the mutualistic fungi P. indica to enhance and manipulate the microbial infection and host metabolism, respectively. These molecules play an important role in the establishment as well as the maintenance of symbiosis in endo and ectomycorrhiza and allow the manipulation of plant defense response (Vahabi et al. 2015a).\nThe antioxidant defense enzymes such as monodehydroascorbate reductase and dehydroascorbate reductase including other components related to the ROS scavenging system have been reported to be modulated by the P. indica (Vadassery et al. 2008). The upregulation of various enzymes involved in the ROS metabolism of the plants exposed to salinity is mediated by P. indica colonization. The tolerance of plants against various abiotic stresses such as heat, salinity, drought, and heavy metal was conferred by the inoculation of P. indica. In addition to protection against abiotic stresses, P. indica also provides protection against various biotic stresses\nP. Selvasekaran and R. Chidambaram\n31\nsuch as pathogenic fungi, bacteria, and virus. The genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of ascorbate in Arabidopsis are due to the greater colonization by P. indica.\nResearch Van Wees et al. (2008) concerning the greenhouse study of Solanum lycopersicum Mill inoculated with the culture filtrates of P. indica showed a significant increase in their growth under osmotic stress and chloride toxicity. The\n1 Agriculturally Important Fungi for Crop Protection\n32\nmechanism underlying the development of resistance by P. indica has already been studied for abiotic and biotic stresses in plants colonized with rhizobacteria but very less research has been done on the mechanism underlying the resistance induced by P. indica against various abiotic and biotic stresses. The observation on the interaction that is beneficial between the host plant and fungus has been reported to upregulate various genes that are related to the mechanism of defense including PR genes involved in pathogenesis and ethylene signaling genes (ERF1) in pathogen attack (Molitor et al. 2011). The plant H. vulgare is protected from Fusarium culmorum and Blumeria graminis which cause root damage and shoot infection, respectively (Molitor et al. 2011). The activity of antagonism by the endophytic fungus, P. indica directly inhibits various root pathogens except for F. culmorum (Waller et al. 2005), F. oxysporum (Saba 2012), and P. herpotrichoides (Serfling et al. 2007). The resistance of host plants against various root pathogens was also reported to be associated with the root colonization of P. indica. The crop plants result in better vegetative and generative development as they are defended against various viral and fungal pathogens.\nTo the economically important agricultural and horticultural crops, the Piriformospora indica has been found to possess the potential as a bio protective agent. The resistance against fungal disease is increased in plants by the utilization\nP. Selvasekaran and R. Chidambaram\n33\nof P. indica. It has been reported (Molitor et al. 2011) that the H. vulgare plants, when colonized with the P. indica, became free from the fungal pathogen such as F. culmorum. The plants treated with the P. indica were protected against root pathogens such as Cochliobolus sativus fungus (Oelmüller et  al. 2009). The systemic resistance against the biotrophic leaf pathogen such as B. graminis f. sp. hordei in H. vulgare roots was developed by colonization with P. indica (Waller et al. 2005). This fungus has also been involved in the biocontrol of take-all diseases of T. aestivum and Fusarium wilt disease of lentil. Therefore from the reports, P. indica is a multifunctional agent providing service such as nutrient uptake, stress tolerance, disease resistance, and promotion of growth (Gill et  al. 2016) (Tables 1.8, 1.9, and 1.10)."

Crop production, particularly in tropical regions is facing increasing stresses caused due to natural and anthropogenic factors. Stress in plants refers to external\nF. A. Abo Nouh · A. M. Abdel-Azeem (*) Systematic Mycology Laboratory, Botany Department, Faculty of Science, University of Suez Canal, Ismailia, Egypt\n56\nconditions that adversely affect growth, development, or productivity of plants (Verma et al. 2013). Stresses trigger a wide range of plant responses like altered gene expression, cellular metabolism, changes in growth rates, crop yields, etc. (Kour et al. 2019b). A plant stress usually reflects some sudden changes in environmental condition. Plant stress can be divided into two primary categories namely abiotic stress and biotic stress (Yadav et al. 2017a). Abiotic stress imposed on plants by environment may be either physical or chemical, while biotic stress exposed to the crop plants is a biological unit like diseases, insects, etc. (Verma et al. 2013). Plants in natural systems and crop lands are simultaneously exposed to both biotic and abiotic stresses. Abiotic stresses such as drought (water stress), excessive watering (water logging), extreme temperatures (cold, frost, and heat), salinity, and mineral toxicity negatively impact growth, development, yield, and seed quality of crops and other plants (Yadav et al. 2020c). Abiotic stress tolerance plays a vital role in determining crop productivity and distribution of plant species across the environment (Boyer 1982; Chaves et al. 2003). These factors are likely to cause serious negative impacts on crop growth and yields and impose severe pressure on our land and water resources (Grover et al. 2011). Environmental stresses such as drought, extreme temperatures, salinity, or chemical toxicity bring serious consequences to crop production, causing collectively more than 50% yield losses worldwide (Wang and Frei 2011). Due to global climate change, abiotic stresses are expected to become more widespread in the coming decades and will pose serious threats to global food security (Ashmore et al. 2006; Battisti and Naylor 2009). Among the environmental stresses, water stress commonly, known as “drought,” is considered as one of the major challenges to crop production worldwide (Yue et al. 2006; Kour et al. 2020a, 2020b, c). If the crop is subjected to stress, particularly drought during its early stage of growth, germination and seedling establishment are severely arrested mainly owing to low water uptake, low energy supply, and hindered enzyme functions (Okcu et al. 2005; Kour et al. 2019a). Oxidative stress, which frequently accompanies high temperature, salinity, or drought stress may cause denaturation of functional and structural proteins (Smirnoff 1998). Plant responses to abiotic stresses are complex, involving signal reception and transduction followed by genetic and physiological responses. It is perceived that all plants are capable of perceiving and responding to stress (Bartels and Sunkar 2005).\nSome biochemical processes which are common to all plant stress responses are: the production of osmolytes, altering water movement, and scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Singh et al. 2011).\nThe interaction of microbes with the plant can be traced back to the origin of plants. Fossil records indicate that fungi have been associated with plants since at least 400 MYA and might have played an important role in the movement of plants from an aquatic arena to comparatively dry terrestrial habitats (Rodriguez et  al. 2008). The most well-known plant–microbe interaction is the mutualism between mycorrhizal fungi and plants where both partners generally benefit from each other (Verma et al. 2017a, b). However, under natural settings, plants form relationships with endophytic fungi which can be beneficial or harmful for the partners depending on host types and natural and environmental situations (Dastogeer and Wylie\nF. A. Abo Nouh and A. M. Abdel-Azeem\n57\n2017). Nasim (2010) showed that the growth and health of colonized plants are improved and they obtain increased protection against biotic and abiotic stresses detrimental to their survival. Among the sustainable efforts, the role of root-associated microbes especially arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in imparting stress tolerance has been exploited by many researchers in the recent years (Evelin et al. 2009; Garg and Singla 2012; Garg and Pandey 2015). Mycorrhizal symbioses are ubiquitous system of green technology. In these symbioses, the fungal mycelia scavenge through soil for resources (often phosphorus or nitrogen) and provide these resources to plants in exchange of organic carbon. The associations are mutualistic most often but sometimes exist as parasitism depending upon fungal nature (Prasad 2017). They are ubiquitous soilborne fungi, whose origin and divergence date back to over 450 million years (Gutjahr and Parniske 2013).\nBesides mycorrhizal endophytes, non-mycorrhizal endophytes (hereafter referred to as endophytes) have been recovered from most plants. Fungal endophytes are microfungi that internally infect living plant tissues without causing disease or any harm to plants, and live in mutualistic association with plants for at least a part of their life cycle (Rana et al. 2019a; Rodriguez et al. 2009; Lugtenberg et al. 2016; Jain and Pundir 2017; Lata et al. 2018; Chhipa and Deshmukh 2019). The existence of fungal endophytes from fossil records suggests that endophyte–host associations may have evolved from the time of development of first higher plants on earth (Dastogeer and Wylie 2017). The plant provides nutrition to the endophytes, while in return endophytes help in adaption to abiotic conditions like nutrients limitation, salination and extreme pH, drought, temperature variation, and protection from pathogens, insects, and nematodes (Chhipa and Deshmukh 2019; Abo Nouh 2019; Yadav et al. 2015a, b; Verma et al. 2016)"

      "heading" : "2.2 Abiotic Stress Effect on Agriculture Crops",
      "text" : "Fundamentally, plants require energy (light), water, carbon, and mineral nutrients for growth. Abiotic stress is defined as environmental conditions that reduce growth and yield below optimum levels. Plant responses to abiotic stresses are dynamic and complex (Skirycz and Inze 2010); they are both elastic (reversible) and plastic (irreversible). The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress (Cramer et al. 2011). Abiotic stresses, such as drought, salinity, extreme temperatures (heat and cold), heavy metal toxicity, and oxidative stress are serious threats to agriculture and result in the deterioration of the environment (Singh et al. 2011; Saxena et al. 2016; Yadav 2017, 2019; Yadav and Yadav 2018). A global water shortage due to significant climatic changes is the leading cause of these abiotic stresses including drought, extreme temperatures, and salinity (Redman et al. 2011; Hussain et al. 2018). Abiotic stress is the primary cause of crop loss worldwide, reducing average yields for most major crop plants by more than 50% (Boyer 1982). Abiotic stress leads to a series of morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular changes that adversely affect plant growth and productivity (Yadav 2017;\n2 Role of Fungi in Adaptation of Agricultural Crops to Abiotic Stresses\n58\nWang et  al. 2001). Drought, salinity, and extreme temperatures, which are often interconnected, result in oxidative burst and cellular damage (Kaur et al. 2020; Rana et al. 2020; Yadav et al. 2019b). For example, water stress and salinization, which are apparent osmotic stress, disrupt the ion distribution and metabolism in the cell (Raghuwanshi 2018). A plant’s first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots. One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role during plant adaptation to environmental stress such as high salinity, drought, low temperature, or mechanical wounding (Gull et al. 2019). Among abiotic stresses, drought stress, soil salinity, and accumulation of heavy metals (HM) in the soil are one of the major grounds of diminished plant performance and restrained crop yield worldwide (López-Ráez 2016). In response, plants modify their root morphology, ultrastructure (Fusconi and Berta 2012), which may modulate their physiology and biochemistry to limit stressinduced damages and/or facilitate the repair of damaged systems (Latef et al. 2016)."

Worldwide, more than 45 million hectares of irrigated land have been damaged by salt, and 1.5 million hectares are taken out of production each year as a result of high salinity levels in the soil (Munns and Tester 2008). It was found that salinity stress resulted in decrease of water content, accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, and electrolyte release in plants (Mandhania et al. 2006). Throughout the world about 45 million hectares of irrigated land is affected by salt (Munns and Tester 2008). Salt stress affects plants in numerous ways such as ion toxicity, nutritional disorders, physiological drought, oxidative stress, modification of metabolic processes, membrane incompetence, and reduction of cell division (Zhu 2007)."

The osmotic effects of salinity stress can be observed immediately after salt application and are believed to continue for the duration of exposure, resulting in inhibited cell expansion and cell division, as well as stomatal closure (Munns 2002). If plants are exposed for long time to salinity, plants face ionic stress, which can direct to premature senescence of adult leaves, and thus a reduction in the photosynthetic area available to support continued growth (Cramer and Nowak 1992). High salt concentration in soil affects plants in two ways such as high concentrations of salts in the soil upset the ability of roots to extract water, and high concentrations of salts within the plant itself can be toxic, resulting in an inhibition of many physiological and biochemical processes such as nutrient uptake and assimilation (Batool et al. 2014).

In the latter condition, the absence of adequate water table which is required for normal plant growth, development, and reproducibility results in drought/water stress (Latef et al. 2016). Severe droughts occur periodically in several major foodproducing countries, having far-reaching impacts on global food production and supply. Drought is the most significant abiotic stress, adversely affecting the productivity and distribution of crop plants worldwide. For example, drought alone affects up to 45% of the global agricultural land (Hussain et al. 2018). Plants reduce their growth of shoots under drought conditions and reduce their metabolic demands. After that protective compounds are synthesized by plants under drought by mobilizing metabolites required for their osmotic adjustment (Gull et al. 2019; Yadav et al. 2018a, b)."

High temperature stress causes extensive denaturation and aggregation of cellular proteins, which lead to cell death (Singh et al. 2011; Verma et al. 2019; Yadav et al. 2019a). Heat stress significantly affects plant growth and development by imparting loss of plant vigor and inhibition of seed germination, retarded growth rate, decreased biomass production, wilting and burning of leaves and reproductive organs, abscission and senescence of leaves, damage as well as discoloration of fruit, reduction in yield and cell death, and enhanced oxidative stress (Begum et al. 2019). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007) reported that global temperatures are predicted to increase by 1.8–3.6 °C by the end of this century due to climate changes (Hussain et al. 2018). Increase in temperature throughout the globe has become a great concern, which not only affects the growth of plants but their productivity as well especially in agricultural crops plants. When plants encounter heat stress the percentage of seed germination, photosynthetic efficiency, and yield declines (Gull\n2 Role of Fungi in Adaptation of Agricultural Crops to Abiotic Stresses\n60\net al. 2019).

Such HMs are produced by various natural activities as well as by different anthropogenic activities such as metal smelting, use and drainage of chemical agro-products (e.g., fertilizers and pesticides), mining tail dumping, and burning of fossil fuels (Wang and Chen 2006). Heavy metal like Cu is taken up by plant cell by specific transport systems. “Free” Cu is extremely dangerous because it will reduce molecular oxygen leading to increased formation of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals switching normal metabolism to programmed cell death (Singh et  al. 2011). At elevated levels, HMs have been documented to cause several morphological, physiological, biochemical, and structural changes in plants including inhibition of seed germination, decrease in root elongation, growth inhibition, disturbance in cellular homeostasis, suppression of photosynthesis rate, leaf chlorosis, and premature leaf senescence (Benavides et al. 2005; Kour et al. 2020d; Yadav et al. 2020d). In addition, toxic metals have been reported to get translocated to different plant parts where they interfere with active sites of many enzymes including phosphatase, ATPase, and enzymatic antioxidants (Latef et al. 2016), thereby destroying protein structures and replacing crucial elements resulting in deficiency symptoms (Bhandari and Garg 2017).\nF.

      "text" : "There are two major classes of fungal symbionts associated with plants: (1) Endophytic fungi, which reside entirely within plant tissues and may be associated with roots, stems, and/or leaves; and (2) Mycorrhizal fungi that reside only in roots but extend out into the rhizosphere (Singh et al. 2011; Rana et al. 2019b). Based on the survey conducted in the last 20 years on endophytes, it is thought that the majority, if not all plants, have one or more types of these endophytes and numerous endophytic species; in some cases, above a hundred can be found in a certain plant species (Arnold 2007). Rodriguez et al. (2009) classified the endophytes under two major groups, viz. clavicipitaceous and non-clavicipitaceous on the basis of phylogeny and life history traits. Clavicipitaceous fungal endophytes are limited to certain grasses, while non-clavicipitaceous ones have a broad host range including both nonvascular and vascular plant species. In addition, recent reviews propose that members of the non-clavicipitaceous group can be segregated into three subgroups on the basis of host range, type of tissue infected, pattern spread, in planta infection and the establishment, diversity, and benefits given to hosts (Rodriguez et al. 2009; Dastogeer and Wylie 2017). Endophytic fungi which are predominantly ascomycetous are ubiquitous and have been isolated from all groups of plants starting from the lower forms like mosses and ferns to the higher ones including the conifers and the angiosperm plants (Arnold 2007), as they have been recovered from plants adapted to a wide range of ecosystems that include hot deserts, Arctic tundra, mangroves, temperate and tropical forests, grasslands and savannahs, croplands (Lugtenberg et al. 2016), and extreme arctic, alpine, and xeric environments (Ali et al. 2018).\nColonization by endophytic fungi promotes plant growth by protecting against several fungal and bacterial borne diseases, assisting in the uptake of available phosphorus or improving the ecological adaptation abilities of the host by providing tolerance to counteract against biotic and abiotic stresses (Schulz et al. 1999; Schulz and Boyle 2005; Yadav et al. 2017a, b). Endophytic fungi have been classified into Clavicipitales, with few hosts within the monocots, and non-clavicipitaceous species inhabiting both monocots and eudicots (Carroll 1988), which probably represent the majority of microbial symbionts which interact with plants, with a great diversity occurring both at taxonomical and at functional levels (Jain and Pundir 2017). Class 2 endophytes have a broad host range of both monocot and eudicot plants, are the largest group of fungal symbionts, are readily culturable on artificial media, and are thought to colonize all plants in natural ecosystems (Rodriguez et al. 2008). Class 2 endophytes confer stress tolerance to host species and play a significant role in the survival of at least some plants in high-stress environments (Rodriguez et al. 2004). For example, class 2 endophytes confer heat tolerance to plants growing in geothermal soils (Redman et al. 2002), the extent of tree leaf colonization by endophytes correlates with the ability to resist pathogens (Arnold et al. 2003), and endophytes confer drought tolerance to multiple host species (Waller et al. 2005).\n2 Role of Fungi in Adaptation of Agricultural Crops to Abiotic Stresses\n62\nMycorrhizae are highly evolved soil fungi involved in tripartite interaction mutualistic associations amid soil and plant. The associations formed by Glomeromycota fungi in plants usually colonize in arbuscules and often vesicles thus, known as vesicular mycorrhiza (AM) and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas (VAM). These are members of Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, and Basidiomycetes classes of fungi kingdom (Prasad 2017). The term symbiosis in mycorrhiza association is used to describe their highly interdependent or obligatory mutualistic relationships with the plants where the host plant receives mineral nutrients and in turn fungus harness photosynthetically derived carbon compounds (Prasad 2015). AMF, belonging to the phylum Glomeromycota (Schüβler et al. 2001) are the obligate biotrophs that have been documented to form symbioses with the roots of more than 80% of terrestrial plant species (except in the plants belonging to families Amaranthaceae, Brassicaceae, Proteaceae, Commelinaceae, Polygonaceae, Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, and Chenopodiaceae) (Gutjahr and Parniske 2013). Mycorrhizal symbionts have long been investigated and considered as the primary mutualistic fungal symbionts associated with plant roots (Diouf et al. 2003). AMF found in rhizosphere and associated with several vascular plants have tremendous contribution in sustainable agriculture as well as agricultural ecosystems management (Prasad 2017). The beneficial effects of indigenous AM fungi on the nutrition replenishment for plants depend on both the abundance and type of fungi present in the soil (Prasad and Gautam 2000). AMF also benefit plants by increasing nutrient water uptake, resistance against phytopathogens, adaptation to a variety of environmental stresses such as drought, heat, salinity and heavy metal contamination, production of growth hormones and certain enzymes, and even in the uptake of radioactive elements (Prasad 2017). AMF are ecologically significant to the majority of vascular plants. It is quite easier to separate the list of mycorrhizae from others (Harley and Smith 1983)."

      "text" : "Symbiosis, defined as the permanent association between two or more specifically distinct organisms, at least during a part of the life cycle, is known to be a ubiquitous and important aspect of life on Earth (Kour et  al. 2019b). Evolutionarily, plants require some specialized microbial partners in order to adapt to certain ecological niches and maintain their normal growth and development (Yuan et al. 2010; Rana et al. 2019c). There are several outcomes of symbiotic interactions defined by the fitness benefits realized by each partner (Lewis and Clements 1986). Benefits to fungal symbionts can be positive (mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism), neutral (amensalism and neutralism), or negative (competition). Benefits to host plants can also be positive (mutualism), neutral (commensalism and neutralism), or negative (parasitism, competition, and amensalism) (Rodriguez et al. 2008). While it is fairly straightforward to determine the impact of symbiosis on host fitness, it is more challenging to determine the benefits for fungal endophytes. Mutualistic benefits for endophytes may involve acquiring nutrients from hosts, abiotic and biotic\nF. A. Abo Nouh and A. M. Abdel-Azeem\n63\nstress avoidance and dissemination by seed transmission (Schardl et  al. 2004; Schulz 2006). Commensal symbioses have no beneficial or detrimental effects on hosts whereas parasitic symbioses negatively affect host fitness by decreasing growth rates and/or fecundity, or inducing disease symptoms that may result in lethality (Redman et al. 2001).\nSuccessful plant–fungal symbioses involve at least three events: penetration by the fungus into plant tissues; colonization of plant tissues by the invading fungus; expression of a fungal symbiotic lifestyle (Pieterse and Dicke 2007; Yadav et al. 2019d). It is assumed that some form of biochemical and/or genetic communication occurs between the symbionts and hosts that allow mutualists to confer physiological benefits to hosts (Singh et al. 2011). Rodriguez et al. (2008) however, current studies suggest that fungi may express different symbiotic lifestyles in response to host genotypes or environmental factors (Yadav et al. 2019c). For example, depending on the physiological status of plants, some mycorrhizal fungi may be mutualistic or parasitic (Johnson et al. 1997). One of the most interesting aspects of lifestyle expression is that the initial phases of infection and colonization by pathogens, mutualists, and commensals are identical for many fungi (Rodriguez et al. 2004). Thus, the mode of recognition and early signaling processes are crucial in understanding how a plant can differentiate between a beneficial and a detrimental microbe and express a lifestyle accordingly (Vadassery and Oelmüller 2009). A very early event in the interaction of pathogenic, mycorrhizal, or endophytic microbes with a plant cell is an increase in the intracellular calcium (Ca2+) levels within seconds or minutes after the recognition of the two partners. Ca2+ ion is a second messenger in numerous plants signaling pathways, coupling extracellular stimuli to intracellular and whole-plant responses. The cellular Ca2+ level is tightly regulated and even a small change in its concentration provides information for protein activation and signaling (Vadassery and Oelmüller 2009; Singh et al. 2011).\nA diverse kind of relationships exists between the fungal endophytes and plant ranging from mutualistic (Redman et al. 2002), symbiotic, and commensal (Deckert et al. 2001) to pathogens (Schulz et al. 1998). However, the state of the interaction between endophyte and host may be transitory, and many factors could make changes in their mode of interaction (Schardl et  al. 2004). For example, Colletotrichum spp. are classified as virulent pathogens, yet several species can express mutualistic lifestyles in non-disease hosts. Mutualistic benefits conferred by Colletotrichum spp. include disease resistance, growth enhancement, and/or drought tolerance (Redman et al. 2001; Singh et al. 2011). When C. magna is introduced into different tomato cultivars, the fungus may express mutualistic, commensal, or parasitic lifestyles. Whereas parasitic and mutualistic lifestyles are easily observed, commensal lifestyles are often designated when no host fitness benefit is observed. However, depending on the traits being assessed, the commensal designation may be misleading (Rodriguez and Redman 2008). For example, C. gloeosporioides was designated a pathogen of strawberry and a commensal of tomato because it conferred no disease protection (Redman et al. 2001); Nevertheless, C. gloeosporioides increased plant biomass and conferred drought tolerance to tomato plants and was therefore designated a mutualist (Rodriguez and Redman 2008).\n2 Role of Fungi in Adaptation of Agricultural Crops to Abiotic Stresses\n64"

The ability of endophytes recovered from grasses were applied to confer drought & water stress, high temperature and high salinity to genetically distant plants such as tomato (Chaw et al. 2004). The concept that fungal endophytes adapt to stress in a habitat-specific manner has been confirmed with different fungal and plant species, and different environmental stresses (Redman et al. 2002). This habitat-specific adaptation is defined as HA-symbiosis, and it is hypothesized that this allows plants to establish and survive in high-stress habitats (Rodriguez and Redman 2008). During performing laboratory and field studies of Class II endophytes from plants from geothermal soils, coastal beaches, and agricultural fields, Rodriguez and co-researchers observed a new ecological phenomenon and defined as habitat-adapted symbiosis. They have determined that endophytes from these habitats confer habitat-specific stress tolerance to plants. This habitat-specific phenomenon provides an intergenomic epigenetic mechanism for plant adaptation and survival in high-stress habitats (Rodriguez et  al. 2008; Singh et al. 2011). For example, within the geothermal soils of Yellowstone National Park, WY, a plant species (Dichanthelium lanuginosum) has been studied and found to be colonized by one dominant endophyte (Curvularia protuberata). C. protuberate confers heat tolerance to the host plant, and neither the fungus nor the plant can survive separately from one another when exposed to heat stress >38 °C (Redman et al. 2002).\nA comparative study of C. protuberata isolates from geothermal and nongeothermal plants revealed that the ability to confer heat tolerance was specific to isolates from geothermal plants, hence the ability to confer heat tolerance is a habitat-adapted phenomenon (Rodriguez et  al. 2008). Another example, a native dunegrass (Leymus mollis) on coastal beaches of Puget Sound, WA, L. mollis which is colonized by one dominant fungal endophyte (Fusarium culmorum), F. culmorum confers salt tolerance to the host plant which cannot survive in coastal habitats without the habitat-adapted endophyte. A comparative evaluation of F. culmorum isolates from L. mollis and a noncoastal plant revealed that the ability to confer salt tolerance was specific to isolates from the coastal plants, indicating that the ability to confer salt tolerance is a habitat-adapted phenomenon (Rodriguez et al. 2008; Singh et al. 2011). Evaluation of C. protuberata, F. culmorum, and C. magna isolates further supports habitat-specific adaptation of endophytes: C. protuberata confers heat but not disease or salt tolerance; F. culmorum confers salt but not heat or disease tolerance; and C. magna confers disease but not heat or salt tolerance (Rodriguez et al. 2008).\nF.

Osmotic potential is determined primarily by two components: solute potential and matrix potential, and it is likely that symbiotic fungi contribute to the matrix potential, which is particularly important in helping plants retain water and thereby enhance plant drought tolerance (Singh et al. 2011). Upon exposure to heat stress, nonsymbiotic panic grass and tomato plants significantly increased osmolyte concentrations as predicted. Increased osmolyte concentrations correlated with the development of subsequent wilting and desiccation symptoms prior to plant death (Rodriguez et al. 2008). In contrast, symbiotic plants either maintained the same (panic grass and Rutgers tomato), (Márquez et al. 2007) or lower (Tiger-Like tomato) (Rodriguez et al. 2008), osmolyte concentrations when compared to non-stressed controls. The differences in osmolyte patterns in tomato may be reflective of differences in the varieties (Rutgers versus Tiger-Like). Most investigations of Epichloe effects on stress tolerance focus on osmotic adjustment, water relations and drought recovery (Cheplick et al. 2000), accumulation of drought protective osmolytes in the grass tissues (Richardson et al. 1992), and photosynthetic rates under water or heat stress (Amalric et al. 1999). Under water stress, the tall fescue endophyte is also associated with a significant increase in cell wall elasticity as measured by bulk modulus tissue elasticity, and by turgid weight to dry weight ratio (TW/DW) (White et al. 1992); likewise, Neotyphodium uncinatum increases TW/DW in water-stressed meadow fescue (Rodriguez et al. 2008)."

Decreased water consumption and increased water-use efficiency may provide a unique mechanism for symbiotically\n2 Role of Fungi in Adaptation of Agricultural Crops to Abiotic Stresses\n66\nconferred drought tolerance. Substantial (>50%) stand losses in tall fescue were reported after removing the endophyte from this grass (Read and camp 1986). These losses are typically associated with drought periods, and endophyte-infected tall fescue exhibits improved recovery after drought compared to endophyte-free tall fescue (Arachevaleta et al. 1989). It was suggested that grass endophytes, particularly N. coenophialum in tall fescue, affect plant–water relations, nutrient acquisition, as well as allocation and photosynthetic assimilation (Bacon 1993)."

Some speculation regarding osmoprotectants centers around the fungal loline alkaloids, which are abundant in those symbiota for which the endophyte has a documented and consistent positive effect on drought tolerance (Malinowski and Belesky 2000). Other potential osmoregulators and protectants are soluble sugars and sugar alcohols, produced by the endophyte, plant, or both (Richardson et al. 1992)."

On the other hand, ROS can act as signaling molecules for stress responses and generation of ROS is an early event in plant response to stress (Apel and Hirt 2004). Tanaka et al. (2006) Therefore, in a pathogenic or symbiotic association, both the plant and the microbe must be able to deal with a complex mixture of ROS coming from both sides. ROS are not necessarily harmful for the partners and, depending on the model considered, they can also help to signal and limit/control the interaction (Rouhier et al. 2008). Certainly, low ROS concentrations are known to be required for signaling, growth, and development, while high concentrations are detrimental to the cell and can damage various macromolecules. It is of primary importance for the development of plant–microbe interactions that ROS produced at the interface between the partners, that is, in the extracellular matrices, cell walls, and more generally the apoplast compartment (Rouhier et al. 2008).\nSymbiotic and nonsymbiotic plants when exposed to ±stress (panic grass and tomato to heat stress and dunegrass and tomato to salt stress) revealed that in the absence of stress, both nonsymbiotic and symbiotic plant leaf tissues for all plants (panic grass, tomato, dunegrass) remained green indicating the absence of ROS\nF.

An interesting feature of the interplay between oxidants and antioxidants is that it occurs in all subcellular compartments including plastids and mitochondria, two sites of extensive ROS production (Navrot et  al. 2007). Under salt stress conditions P. indica increases the tolerance of a salt-sensitive barley (Hordeum vulgare) cultivar to severe salt stress. P. indica-colonized plants contained higher ascorbate concentrations in roots compared with noncolonized plants, while the ratio of ascorbate vs. dehydroascorbate was not significantly altered and catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and monodehydroascorbate reductase activities were increased (Waller et al. 2005; Singh et al. 2011)."

Grass species growing on coastal areas harbor symbiotic fungal endophytes which strengthen them against salinity and heat (Rodriguez et al. 2008). These endophytes have been reported to induce salt tolerance in several noncoastal plants. Leymus mollis (dunegrass), plants harboring endophyte Fusarium culmorum, flourished on the coastal beaches of the USA, which are areas of high salinization. Salt-sensitive plants not growing in coastal areas were able to develop salt tolerance when inoculated with the endophyte Fusarium culmorum (Rodriguez et  al. 2008). Redman et al. (2011) showed that some class 2 fungal endophytes can confer salt and drought tolerance to two commercial rice varieties which were not adapted to these stresses. Moreover, these endophytes reduced water consumption by 20–30% while increasing growth rate, reproductive yield, and biomass of greenhouse grown plants. Colonization of plants by P. indica shows salt tolerance, and this attribute is well demonstrated in tobacco (Nicotiana) and members of Poaceae family like barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), wheat (Triticum), and rice (Oryza sativa) which involve the detoxification of ROS by initiating production of antioxidants and enhancing the photosynthetic efficiency (Johnson et al. 2014).\nTolerance of the host Festuca arundinacea against a hydrocarbon mixture was enhanced by endophytic fungi Lewia (Cruz-Hernández et al. 2013).

Perhaps the most widely documented example of endophyte-mediated drought stress tolerance in plants is the enhanced drought tolerance of tall fescue and perennial ryegrass due to infection of the endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum (Dastogeer and Wylie 2017). Interestingly, all fungal endophytes conferred drought tolerance to plants regardless of the habitat of origin (Rodriguez et  al. 2008). Kane (2011) studied the leaf-inhabiting endophyte Neotyphodium lolii to assess its potential benefits or harm in drought stress tolerance of native perennial ryegrass collections formerly obtained from the Mediterranean regions. The findings showed that endophyte colonization can help improve biotic stress tolerance such as drought in N. lolii (Cheplick 2006; Suman et al. 2016). Curvularia protuberata (Cp4666D) and Fusarium culmorum (FcRed1) isolates from geothermal soil and Costal Beach both conferred similar levels of drought tolerance in tomato (Rodriguez et al. 2008) and rice (Redman et al. 2011). Endophytes Chaetomium globosum and Penicillium resedanum isolated from Capsicum annuum plants promoted shoot length and biomass of the host plants subjected to drought stress (Khan et al. 2012). Drought-challenged tomato plants showed higher root and shoot biomass when inoculated with class 2 fungal endophytes, including Alternaria sp. and Trichoderma harzianum (Azad and Kaminskyj 2016).

Penicillium brevicompactum isolated from wild barley species was helpful in drought tolerance improvement of barley plant in drought condition (Chhipa and Deshmukh 2019).\nExtensive amount of research literature indicates that mycorrhizae often have a substantive impact on water movement into, through, and out of host plants, with consequent effects on plant tissue hydration and leaf physiology (Nasim 2010). They usually increase host growth rates during drought, by affecting nutrient acquisition and possibly hydration and typically water-use efficiency, which are influenced by the kind of fungi involved (Augé 2001). Growing evidence indicates that association with AM fungi can improve overall plant growth and reproducibility by improving root length, leaf area, plant biomass, plant tissue hydration, and nutrient uptake under water-deficit condition (Bhandari and Garg 2017). Mycorrhizal plants may avoid drought to some extent through enhanced water uptake at low soil moisture levels. In onion, the effects seem to be conferred through improved phosphorus nutrition (Nelson and Safir 1982). An influence on host osmotic potential has been observed in wheat (Allen and Bosalis 1983). However, there is a strong evidence of drought stress alleviation by AMF in different crops such as wheat, barley, maize, soybean, strawberry, and onion (Ruiz-Lozano et al. 2015). Lavender plants inoculated with Glomus intraradices and Glomus sp. strain accumulated these compounds and exhibited high drought tolerance by improving water contents, root biomass, and N and P contents (Hussain et al. 2018). While working on sunflower plant exposed to drought stress, Gholamhoseini et al.

Moreover, a majority of reports state that various plants inoculated with AMF at low temperature grow better than non-AMF inoculated plants (Liu et al. 2013). AMF support plants in combating cold stress and eventually improve plant development (Begum et al. 2019). Maya and Matsubara (2013) have reported the association of AMF Glomus fasciculatum with plant growth and development leading to positive changes in growth under the conditions of high temperature. For example, during cold stress, AMF-inoculated plants showed an enhanced water conservation capacity as well as its use efficiency (Zhu et al. 2010). The role of AMF during cold stress has also been reported to alter protein content in tomato and other vegetables (Abdel Latef and Chaoxing 2011)."

In addition, more than 30 species of AM fungi have been identified in contaminated soils worldwide and some at high frequencies, such as Paraglomus occultum, G. clarum, G. intraradices, and Scutellospora pellucida (Bhandari and Garg 2017). Studies have further depicted that spores isolated from polluted soils are more tolerant to and germinated better in HM-polluted soil in comparison to spores isolated from non-polluted soils (Gaur and Adholeya 2004). Consequently, AM fungi have been validated to lower the translocation of metals from roots to aerial organs (Garg and Kaur 2012). In one of the studies, Garg and Kaur (2012) demonstrated that in comparison with non-AM pigeon pea plants, colonization with F. mosseae led to significant immobilization of metals—Cd and Zn in roots—thus leading to lower translocation of toxic ions in above-ground plant organs in mycorrhizal- stressed plants. Similarly, colonization with R. intraradices restricted large amount of Pb in roots of woody legume Robinia pseudoacacia, thus preventing future damage to above-ground parts (Bhandari and Garg 2017). AMF association with wheat positively increased nutrient uptake under aluminum stress. Also in rice, AMF were very effective in lowering the levels of Cd in both the vacuoles and cell wall (Begum et al. 2019)."

      "text" : "Now a days, we are suffering with a problem climate change which is causing drought in large areas of the earth (Sheffield et al. 2012). Drought is one of the most destructive abiotic stresses being faced by plants and it has widely attracted the attention of agricultural scientists and biotechnologists. Drought is a major concerned agriculture problem and reduces or limits plant growth and productivity (Kour et al. 2020b). A large piece of agricultural land is affected by drought and it adversely affects human society, economical rate, etc. (Disante et al. 2011; Mishra and Singh 2010). Drought stress limits water content available in soil, reduces cell size, membrane integrity, produces reactive oxygen species, and promotes leaf senescence causing reduction in crop productivity (Kour et al. 2020a; Tiwari et al. 2015). Apart from morphological changes there are some molecular changes in drought stressed plants such as increase in ethylene production (stress-responsive\nD. Goyal (*) · S. Mishra · P. K. Dantu Department of Botany, Dayalbagh Educational Institute, Deemed University, Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India\n82\nphytohormone), reduction in chlorophyll content, and inhibition in photosynthetic rate (Lata and Prasad 2011). Drought elevates accumulation of free radicals that induce change in membrane function, protein conformation, and lipid peroxidation leading to cell death (Tiwari et al. 2016; Yadav et al. 2020c, d, e). It is being believed by some scientists there will be increase in drought as time passes out due to climate change. Drought stress is among the most destructive abiotic stress that increased in intensity over the past decades affecting world’s food security (Kour et al. 2019; Singh and Yadav 2020). Drought stress may range from moderate and short to extremely severe and prolonged duration, restricting the crop yields (Austin 1989; Pereira and Chaves 1995). Drought is expected to cause serious plant growth problems for more than 50% of the arable lands by 2050 (Ashraf 1994; Vinocur and Altman 2005; Kasim et  al. 2013). Under drought stress plants adapt themselves through physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses (Ito et al. 2006) and control water status by adjustment of root hydraulic conduction, reduced transpiration, and stomatal closure (Parent et al. 2009). A change in plant stress- responsive genes is found by transcriptomic and proteomic approaches (Hirayama and Shinozaki 2010; Deshmukh et  al. 2014; Liu et  al. 2015). Some genes are found upregulated whereas others are found downregulated.\nIn molecular responses of drought, plants synthesize some specific proteins to impart drought tolerance such as LEA (late embryogenesis abundant), DSP (Desiccation stress protein), and dehydrins (Fig. 3.1). In addition, mycorrhizal association is a symbiotic non-pathogenic relationship between plant roots and fungal hyphae (Osonubi et al. 1991; Sieverding et al. 1991). In this mutualistic association, the fungi gain carbon compounds and other nutritional supplements from the roots of plants, and in return, provide the plant with macro and micronutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) from the soil. The importance of mycorrhizae association in both agricultural and ecological systems had earlier been widely recognized (Mosse 1978; Osonubi et al. 1991). The increased plant growth by vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM)\nD. Goyal et al.\n83\nassociation is usually due to increased mineral elements uptake by the hyphae from the soil, improved water relations and pest resistance of host plants (Farahani et al. 2008; Olawuyi et al. 2011a, b, 2012). VAM provided tolerance to a variety of abiotic stresses (Wilcox et al. 1990) and increased resistance to soil pathogens (Odebode et al. 1998; Pozo et al. 2002; Olawuyi et al. 2014a, b). Mycorrhizae can also resist drought in many plants under stress conditions; therefore, the plants infected with VAM are less likely to wilt under drought affected conditions as compared to noninoculated plants (Lindermann and Hendrix 1982; Olawuyi et al. 2011a, b, 2014a, b)."

Most of the AMF belong to the sub-phylum Glomeromycotina, of the phylum Mucoromycota (Spatafora et  al. 2016). AM fungi are classified in four orders namely, Glomerales, Archaeosporales, Paraglomerales, and Diversisporales and these orders include 25 genera (Redecker et  al. 2013). Mycorrhizae are obligate biotrophs and ingest carbon compounds (Bago et al. 2000) and lipids to sustain their life cycle (Jiang et al. 2017). AMF provide drought tolerance to plants and act as safety-valve against fungal pathogens (Smith and Read 2008; Jung et al. 2012). In this way, Mycorrhizae are playing a vital role to maintain energy system and global harmony (Yadav et al. 2019a, b, c). They act as biofertilizers and improve crop productivity under adverse conditions also (Gianinazzi et al. 2010)."

Biofertilizers improve soil health and plant growth and development (Kour et  al. 2020c; Sadhana 2014; Yadav et  al. 2020a). From a long ago many researches are being conducted on AMF and myriad benefits are observed on soil health and crop productivity. Therefore, it is considered that AMF could be used as bio-fertilizer as a substitute of inorganic fertilizers due to their application can lower the quantitative use of chemical fertilizer input especially of phosphorus (Ortas 2012). Continuous exposure of herbicides, inorganic fertilizers, and fungicides has caused ecological imbalance and many threats to soil, plants, and human health, through their harmful effect on the quality of food products, soil composition, and aquatic bodies. It is believed that AMF can lower down the application of chemical fertilizers up to 50% for best agricultural production, but this estimate depends on the type of plant species and the prevalent stressful regimes (Rana et al. 2019; Yadav et al. 2020b). AMF are being used in various\n3 Arbuscular Mycorrhizae Associations and Role in Mitigation of Drought Stress…\n84\napplications such as to provide resistance to plants against various abiotic stress and biotic stress along with used as biofertilizers (Fig. 3.2).\n3.4 Mechanisms Used by AMF to Provide Drought Tolerance to Plants\nThere are certain mechanisms which explain how AMF provide resistance to plants against drought stress such as (1) adjustment of hormonal balance (Estrada-Luna and Davies Jr 2003), (2) enhancement of plant water status by improving hydraulic conductivity through an increase of water absorption by the external hyphae of VAM (Augé et al. 2007), (3) osmotic adjustment (Porcel and Ruiz-Lozano, 2004), (4) increase in antioxidant activity (Goicoechea et al. 2005), and (5) higher nutrients absorption (Al-Karaki 2006).

On the other hand, in tomato concentration of ABA increases under drought stress (Asensio et al. 2012). This change in hormonal levels is due to AMF genotype and the host plant (Ludwig-Müller 2010); it is found through various studies that, under drought stress, the mutualistic association with AMF regulates the ABA content (Table  3.1) (Estrada-Luna and Davies Jr 2003). ABA is primary requirement of AMF for sustainability and colonization, in host plant especially in water-deficit stress (Ludwig-Müller 2010). In fact, in tomato, ABA increases the susceptibility of plants to AMF colonization and appears to play an indispensable role in the development and functionality of arbuscules (Herrera-Medina et al. 2007).

ABA and strigolactones are apocarotenoids (Auldridge et al. 2006) and their biosynthesis is similar to each other (Walter et al. 2010).

JA also plays important roles in the development and functionality of arbuscules together with ABA (Isayenkov et  al. 2005). The increase of JA could be related to the variation of the root osmotic potential, caused by an increase of carbohydrates from shoots (Ludwig-Müller 2010). It has been suggested that sugar could induce the expression of genes related to JA biosynthesis, which could elevate the JA level and produce an increase in the sink strength through the extracellular invertase, whose expression is induced in mycorrhizal roots (Schaarschmidt et al. 2006). The narrow relationship found between ABA and AMF colonization in water-deficit conditions, as well as the functionality of the arbuscules suggests that the association between AMF and some plants could be one strategy to deal with a water deficit, probably regulated by the interaction of ABA with other hormones (Table 3.1)."

Mycorrhizal hyphae that are involved in water transport (Allen 2009) are characterized by a diameter between 2 μm and 5  μm and can penetrate smaller soil pores that are inaccessible to root hairs (10–20  μm diameter) and thereby absorb water that is not available to nonmycorrhizal plants (Marulanda et al. 2003). AMF produce a glycoprotein known as glomalin, which generates stable aggregates and beneficial effects on soil structures (Wu et al. 2008).

(2005) reported that non-inoculated plants of Myrtus communis and Phillyrea angustifolia under drought stress increased their superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and total peroxidase (POX) activity as compared to inoculated plants. According to second mechanism there is an increase in the production of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants in plants symbiosed with AMF especially in water-deficit conditions (Zou et al. 2015; Amiri et al. 2015; Abbaspour et al. 2012). AM fungi are found to reduce the content of malondialdehyde and soluble protein in host plant and improved the activity of SOD and CAT (Gaspar et al. 1991). Recently, maize plants under water-deficit conditions have been found to be benefited by the AMF\n3 Arbuscular Mycorrhizae Associations and Role in Mitigation of Drought Stress…\n92\nsymbiosis not only by a lower oxidative stress, but also by local restriction and nonsystemic oxidative stress (Bárzana et  al. 2015). However, the exact mechanism involved is not yet clear and requires further experiments to better understand the actual function of AMF in the changes of reactive oxygen metabolism and antioxidants production (Table 3.1)."

Although phosphorous is abundant in soil, only 0.1% of the total phosphorous is available to plants (in the form of orthophosphates H2PO4− and HPO42−), thus making it a major limiting factor for plant growth (Zhou et al. 1992; Illmer and Schinner 1995). Since it is less mobile in soil through ion transporters and aquaporins AM improve its transport in host plants (Augé 2004). Inoculation of AM increase P content in plants such as marigold, wheat, sorghum, and squash (Asrar and Elhindi 2011; Al-Karaki et al. 2004; Wu and Xia 2006; Augé et al. 2007).

AMF inoculation improves photosynthetic rate of plants by increasing stomatal conductance and, therefore, CO2 fixing (Boldt et al. 2011). Increased stomatal conductance enhances the rate of photosynthesis in corn, guava, and rosemary (Estrada et al. 2013; Estrada-Luna et al. 2000; SánchezBlanco et al. 2004). Some of the non-stomatal factors also enhance photosynthesis rate by increasing accumulation of photosynthetic pigments, and protecting photosynthetic apparatus from reactive oxygen species, avoiding photo inhibition (Asrar and Elhindi 2011). Inoculation of AM increases content of photosynthetic pigments in marigold (Asrar and Elhindi 2011), Indian coral tree (Manoharan et al. 2010), sweet potato (Yooyongwech et al. 2016), and tangerine (Wu and Xia 2006). AMF improves the efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm) in corn, tomato, olive and black hawthorn plants (Ruíz-Sánchez et al. 2010; Yooyongwech et al. 2016; Estrada et al. 2013; Boldt et al. 2011). As a consequence of increase in (Fv/Fm) plants use the excitation energy more efficiently for CO2 assimilation (Table  3.1). This increased CO2 assimilation results in higher quantity of carbohydrates and plant biomass under drought stress (Boldt et al. 2011). F. mosseae (mycorrhizal fungi) establishes a symbiotic association with indian coral tree plants and increased contents of chlorophylls, carotenoids, and proteins and decreased the content of sugars, starches and proline (Manoharan et al. 2010). Wu and Xia (2006) reported symbiosis effect of Glomus versiforme with trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) and found increase in chlorophyll and carotenoids and decrease in sugars, starches, and proline.

It is known as an abiotic environmental factor and is common globally (Wani et al. 2016). Salt stress also inhibits the growth of shoots and roots, and perturbs plant metabolism and physiological status as a result of ionic disparity in plant cells (Munns and Tester 2008). Salinity stress is caused by accumulation of compatible solutes and upregulation of antioxidants in cell signaling\nP. Chandra (*) Department of Environmental Microbiology, School for Environmental Sciences, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University (a central university), Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India\nEnespa Department Plant Pathology, Sri Mahesh Prasad Degree College, University of Lucknow, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India\nR. Singh Lucknow, India\n102\npathways and cellular responses (Wang et al. 2003). Additionally, observations have shown that ∼6% of the total land area around the world and 50% of the irrigated land are acutely affected by salt stress (Shabala and Cuin 2008).\nIn all plants, calcium is an essential element, which maintains the integrity and structures of membranes and cell walls through formation of intermolecular linkages (Baluška et al. 2003). Toxic accumulation of Na+ ions in the cytosol leads to increased ambient salt concentrations. Procurement and homeostasis of essential nutrients such as K+ and Ca2+ are affected by inconsistent presence of Na+ in both cellular and extracellular partitions (Banjara et  al. 2012). A low K+:Na+ ratio is another specific symptom of salt toxicity. For activation of many enzymes, the presence of K+ in the cytosol is essential (Maathuis and Amtmann 1999). Excess Na+ tends to substitute K+ with Na+ at binding sites and hence impairs cellular biochemistry because of physicochemical similarities between Na+ and K+ (Benito et al. 2014).\nPlants adapt by de novo synthesis of organic compatible solutes acting as osmolytes to cope with salt stress–induced osmotic problems (Paul 2013; Suman et al. 2016; Yadav et al. 2019a). The highly ordered states of membranes and quaternary protein structures are stabilized by glycine betaine, which acts as an osmoprotectant (Sakamoto and Murata 2001). Under salt stress, proline serves as a storage sink for carbon and nitrogen and also as a free-radical scavenger, stabilizes subcellular structures (membranes and proteins), and buffers cellular redox potential (Sotiropoulos 2007).\nAccumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide radicals (O) hydrogen peroxide (HO) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) is induced by salt stress, with detrimental effects on plant growth and metabolism (Cakmak 2005). Therefore, soil amendment through exploitation of soil fungi is of considerable importance (Besharati et al. 2018). In saline conditions, various biological approaches such as use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to enhance plant growth and tolerance of abiotic environmental stress are receiving increasing recognition from scientists (Evelin et al. 2009).\nAMF also improve nutrient access and physiological processes such as the water absorption capacity of plants by increasing root hydraulic conductivity and favorably adjusting the osmotic balance and composition of carbohydrates in saline soil (Abdelhamid et al. 2019; Yadav et al. 2019b). Therefore, excess salt accumulation in the root is also ameliorated, and various observations have demonstrated effects on osmotic adjustment (Arora and Sahni 2019). Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.)) is a major grain legume (pulse) annual crop in the tropics and subtropics. It can be used as a source of seed and forage for livestock and as a soil ameliorator in agroforestry and shifting cultivation systems (Dagar 2016). A number of cereals such as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), and maize (Zea mays L.) have traditionally been grown in intercropping or mixed cropping systems (Gemenet et al. 2016). AMF can play an important role in improvement of salt tolerance in various crops. The main objective of this chapter is to characterize salt resistance approaches by describing membrane peroxidation, electrolyte leakage, osmolyte accumulation, and enzymatic antioxidant defense systems under\nP. Chandra et al.\n103\nabiotic salinity stress (Laouane et al. 2019). To date, there is little information available on the effects of salinity on plant biomass and nitrogen fixation, antioxidant defense systems, and use of mycorrhizal inoculation for osmoprotection in legumes (Wang et al. 2016).\nObservations have revealed a possible interrelationship between AMF inoculation and tolerance of ionic, osmotic, and oxidative stress in pigeonpea exposed to long-term salinity. Trichoderma longibrachiatum T6 (T6) has been shown to promote wheat growth and induce plant resistance to parasitic nematodes (Zhang et al. 2016a, b). Aspergillus aculeatus has an important effect on mitigation of salt stress by producing indole- 3- acetic acid and siderophores, thereby conferring stress tolerance on plants, as shown in perennial ryegrass (Li et al. 2019). The possible effects of 24-epibrassinolide and the AMF Glomus mosseae, singularly and collectively, on salt stress in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants have been studied (Tofighi et al. 2017). Important indicators of salt stress, such as the growth rate and nutritive values of perennial ryegrass, have been observed in order to explain mechanisms of protection against salt stress in ryegrass (Hu et al. 2012).\nAntioxidant activities such as lipid peroxidation, photosynthetic routines, ionic homeostasis, and metabolic homeostasis have been scrutinized (Jackson et  al. 2007). It has been estimated that associations between roots and AMF are present in over 80% of terrestrial plant species such as halophytes, hydrophytes, and xerophytes (Uhlmann et al. 2006). Mycorrhizal application represents a good option to alleviate salt stress through biological processes. Additionally, AMF can expand host physiological processes such as the water absorption capacity of plants by increasing root hydraulic conductivity and favorably adjusting the osmotic balance and composition of carbohydrates (Syvertsen and Garcia-Sanchez 2014). This may lead to increased plant growth and consequent dilution of toxic ion effects (Al-Karaki 2000; Yadav and Saxena 2018). These benefits of AMF have encouraged their use for mycoremediation of saline soils (Kumar et al. 2019a). Various plant growth– promoting fungi (PGPF) that reduce salinity stresses in various crops are listed in Table 4.1. These fungi—such as Aspergillus, Fusarium, Trichoderma, Penicillium, Piriformospora, Phoma, Claroideoglomus, Glomus, and Rhizoctonia—have a natural capability to stimulate various growth-related traits of plants and thereby benefit the plants (Contreras-Cornejo et al. 2009; Enespa and Chandra 2019).\nVarious observations in dicots and monocots have shown that PGPF mimic wellstudied plant growth–promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in their interactions with host plants (Chandra and Singh 2016; Kour et al. 2019b; Kumar et al. 2019b; Singh et  al. 2020; Yadav et  al. 2018a). As an example, treatment of seeds with PGPF inoculum can improve germination and seedling vigor, and induces growth of longer and larger shoots in different plants. Some PGPF may exert effects on root development and performance (Enespa and Chandra 2017). The photosynthetic capability of plants can also be enhanced by PGPF inoculation, stimulating early and vigorous flowering of the plants. Various PGPF have the capability to stimulate the production of the host’s secondary metabolites and increase crop productivity (Singh and Yadav 2020; Yadav et  al. 2019c). PGPF show beneficial effects on growth and changes in biochemical, physiological, and molecular mechanisms used\n4 Soil Salinity and Its Alleviation Using Plant Growth–Promoting Fungi\n104\nP. Chandra et al.\n105\nby host plants to alleviate salt stress (Zhang et al. 2016a, b; Rastegari et al. 2020a). This chapter discusses the effects of salinity on PGPF—such as colonization, hyphal length, and sporulation both in  vivo and in  vitro—and the presence of fungi in saline soils."

      "text" : "The physicochemical processes resulting from the presence of various salts in soil and water are known as salinization. In irrigated agricultural systems, soil salinity is an enormous problem. There are two main types of soil salinity: primary and secondary (Qadir and Schubert 2002). Primary salinity refers to natural processes of salt formation in soil and water. Development of secondary salinity results from anthropogenic activities such as land development, agriculture, irrigation, and industrial development (Rengasamy 2006). Common causes of secondary salinity are rising groundwater tables due to excessive irrigation or use of poor-quality water, clearance of vegetation, and changes in land use. Soils in hot and dry regions of the world are frequently saline with low agricultural potential. Secondary salinization of land and water resources in arid and semiarid conditions results from major anthropogenic activities such as agricultural irrigation (Chandra and Enespa 2019a; Machado and Serralheiro 2017).\nAnthropic salinization occurs in arid and semiarid areas because of waterlogging and mismanagement of irrigated water (Singh 2015). Worldwide, more than 45 million hectares of irrigated land, representing about 20% of all irrigated land and about 2% of all dryland agriculture, has already been damaged by salt (Carillo et al. 2011). Poor irrigation systems causing loss of once productive agricultural land represent the most serious salinity threat (Machado and Serralheiro 2017). Calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and sodium (Na+) salts are found in irrigation water. Evapotranspiration plays a very significant role in pedogenesis of saline soils in arid and semiarid regions. Ions of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) salts released after evaporation often precipitate into carbonates, leaving Na+ dominant in the soil (Acosta et al. 2011; Qadir et al. 2007). Therefore, high concentrations of Na+ in the soil solution may put a brake on nutrient ion activities and produce extreme Na+:Ca2+ or Na+:K+ ratios (Guan et al. 2017; Antoniadis et al. 2015). During the last century, physical, chemical, and/or biological land degradation processes have resulted in\n4 Soil Salinity and Its Alleviation Using Plant Growth–Promoting Fungi\n106\nserious concerns about compaction, inorganic/organic contamination, and diminished microbial activity/diversity in natural soil resources worldwide (Mondal and Kaur 2017). As a result of introduction of irrigation, the areas of soils affected by these problems continue to increase each year. In India, saline soil mostly occurs in the Indo-Gangetic plain, which covers the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, and some parts of Rajasthan. Semiarid tracts in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh are also largely affected by saline soils, as are arid tracts in Gujarat and Rajasthan (Chandra and Singh 2014; Shinde 2018; Silva et al. 2019)."

Individual PGPF may differ conspicuously from one another in terms of their taxonomy, habitats, physiology, and interactions with plants, as observed in various studies (Bhattacharyya et al. 2016; Venturi and Keel 2016). A fungus that stimulates the growth of a given plant may not have the same effect upon the growth of another plant, or the effect may vary under a different set of environmental conditions (Hardoim et al. 2015; Vejan et al. 2016; Yadav et al. 2019d). Not all fungi that promote plant growth are considered to be PGPF, in the same way that symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi are known to improve plant growth but are not considered to be PGPF (Baum et al. 2015; Hossain et al. 2017). Mycorrhizal fungi behave as obligate biotrophs and establish an intimate association with the roots of most host plants (Hiruma et al. 2018). On the other hand, PGPF are nonsymbiotic saprotrophic fungi, which live freely on the root surface, in the interior of the root itself, or in the rhizosphere (Kour et al. 2019a). Fungal microbial flora identified as PGPF have diverse taxonomy (Chagas et al. 2018). The majority of true fungi characterized as PGPF primarily belong to the phylum Ascomycota (Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, Chaetomium, Cladosporium, Colletotrichum, Exophiala, Fusarium, Gliocladium, Penicillium, Phoma, Phomopsis, Purpureocillium, Talaromyces, and Trichoderma), and a few of them belong to Basidiomycota (Limonomyces, Rhizoctonia, Rhodotorula, and sterile fungi) and Zygomycota (Mucor and Rhizopus), according to the literature (Hossain et al. 2017; Rana et al. 2019a; Sharma et al. 2019; Yadav 2019; Zhang et al. 2018a, b). Fusarium oxysporum, Colletotrichum, and binucleate Rhizoctonia are phylogenetically related to plant pathogens but lack functional virulence determinants for many of the plant hosts from which they can be recovered (Lorenzo-Gutiérrez et al. 2019; Jiang et al. 2018). The members of the Oomycota are mostly virulent plant pathogens, while some are nonpathogenic (Hassani et al. 2018). Pythium oligandrum and Phytophthora cryptogea, which colonize root ecosystems and act as PGPF, are nonpathogenic oomycetes (Hossain et al. 2017). PGPF mostly have origins either in the soil or in the roots of a large range of hosts.\nP. Chandra et al.\n107\nCommonly, 44% of rhizospheric fungal isolates are PGPF (Compant et al. 2010). The occurrence of PGPF in the rhizospheric region differs between different crop plants. Various fungi that live inside the root tissues or endophytes also have miscellaneous positive effects on plant growth and are PGPF (Cardoso Filho 2019). Fusarium, Penicillium, and Alternaria are the most dominant endophytes (Barsainya et al. 2016; Khalmuratova et al. 2015)."

Most agricultural crops come under the category of glycophytes, which exhibit a spectrum of responses under salt stress (Volkmar et al. 1998; Hester et al. 2001). Salinity affects the physicochemical properties and ecological balance of the land, leading to low economic returns, soil erosion, and decreased crop productivity (Karami et al. 2012).\nThe particular effects of salinity include the following:\n• Excessive accumulation of sodium ions in cell walls results in osmotic stress and cell death (Flowers and Yeo 1986; Munns and Passioura 1984). • Higher concentrations of salt in soil can interrupt nutrient stability in plants or interfere with uptake of some nutrients (Bernstein and Hayward 1958). • Extensive decreases in leaf area, chlorophyll content, and stomatal conductance occur, leading to a less competent photosystem II (PS-II) (Hura et al. 2007). • A substantial reduction in phosphorus uptake by plants occurs as a result of precipitation of phosphate ions in the form of calcium phosphate (Wendling et al. 2013). • Salinity inhibits the development of fertilization by weakening microsporogenesis and stamen filament elongation, causing ovule abortion and senescence of fertilized embryos (Gómez et al. 2015). • The supply of photosynthetic assimilates or hormones to growing tissues becomes impaired (Weber 2009). • Salt stress is a result of ion toxicity in which the K+:Na+ ratio changes, leading to replacement of K+ by Na+ in biochemical reactions. Because of this, quite a few enzymatic activities, as well as binding of transfer RNA (tRNA) to ribosomes— and consequently protein synthesis, in which K+ is a requisite—are inhibited (Almeida et al. 2017). Furthermore, high levels of Na+ and Cl− induce conformational changes in proteins. Recent reports have also shown that salinity adversely affects plant growth and development by hindering enzyme activity (Rani et al. 2019), DNA, RNA, protein synthesis, and mitosis (Atieno et al. 2017). • Osmotic stress and ion toxicity can cause metabolic imbalance, which in turn leads to oxidative stress (Liang et al. 2018).\n4 Soil Salinity and Its Alleviation Using Plant Growth–Promoting Fungi\n108\n• Cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclin activities are reportedly hindered by soil salinity, resulting in fewer cells in the meristem and limited growth.

In saline areas, the average density of spores has been reported to be low by some investigators but not others (Yang et al. 2018a, b). The most predominant species of AMF in the severely saline soils of the Tabriz plains (with an electrical conductivity (ECe) of 162 dS m−1) were found to be Glomus intraradices, Glomus versiform, and Glomus etunicatum (Becerra et al. 2019; Sheng et al. 2019). Increases in AMF spore numbers in the presence of soil salinity (defined as a mean of 100 spores per 10 g of soil) have been observed by various investigators (Bencherif et al. 2019a, b). Sporulation is stimulated under salt stress in saline soil with a high fungal spore density (Kissoudis et al. 2015). It has also been revealed that in severely saline ecosystems with low root colonization levels, AMF may produce spores (Sheng et al. 2019). One study found that saline soils with ECe of approximately 45 dS m−1 had zero spore inhabitants, in contrast to other observations (Kong et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2015). A 150 mM NaCl concentration inhibited hyphal growth and spore germination of AMF. An abundance of AMF spores were found in highly alkaline soils with a pH of up to 11; the degree of colonization varied between individual AMF, independently of the soil type and salt type (NaCl, Na2CO3, Na2SO4, or CaSO4) (Hage-Ahmed et al. 2019; Latef et al. 2016; Porcel et al. 2016). AMF spore distribution was evaluated in two salt marshes (Powell and Rillig 2018). Greater AMF biodiversity was observed in\nP. Chandra et al.\n109\nsoil samples from both sites on the basis of morphological analysis of spores, but the overall biodiversity was lower in the roots at both sites, according to sequencing analysis (Faggioli et al. 2019; Berruti et al. 2017). AMF interactions were found to have valuable effects on water status, addition of osmolytes, and growth of Phragmites australis plants in a saline environment (Pereira et al. 2016).\nIn mycorrhizal Aster tripolium plants in saline soil, an amended water relationship was observed. It was reported that the most common AMF observed in saltstressed soil were Glomus spp., and one species, Glomus geosporum, produced 80% of the spores detected by biological molecular techniques (Mahmood et al. 2019; Plouznikoff et al. 2016). In the primary stage of growth, Glomus mosseae, Glomus intraradices, and Glomus claroideum were found to ameliorate salt stress in olive trees (Yasmeen et al. 2019). In terms of olive tree performance, Glomus mosseae was the most proficient fungus in acting against unfavorable effects of salinity, particularly in terms of the protection it offered (Kour et al. 2019). The negative properties of salinity stress may be contingent on the behavior of each species of AMF and its capability in protecting the plants, as suggested by these observations (Igiehon and Babalol 2018). Various observations have revealed that AMF increase the growth and productivity of plants through ingredient uptake, but the exact apparatus used by AMF to alleviate the reduction of growth in saline conditions is not yet clear (Vangelisti et al. 2018).\nIn severely saline soil conditions, Glomus intraradices, Glomus versiforme, and Glomus etunicatum were found to be the most predominant species (Chun and Chandrasekaran 2018). Hyphal growth, spore germination, and colonization capability are adversely affected by extremely saline conditions, and salt can reduce formation of arbuscular mycorrhizae (Wang et  al. 2017; Venneman et  al. 2017). However, spore germination is not prevented or inhibited in severely saline ecosystems, although it may be delayed (Nagler et al. 2015). Multiple biochemical pathways such as ion homeostasis and retention and/or acquisition of water help to protect chloroplast functions in salt-tolerant plants (Suo et al. 2017)."

In most soils, the ionic form of phosphate is poorly transferred. A phosphate-depleted soil zone forms around plant roots over time, as a result of continuous nutrient uptake by the roots (York et al. 2016; Hinsinger et al. 2018). The extraradical hyphae of AMF play a dynamic part in nutrient uptake from soil after colonization is successfully completed (Hodge et al. 2010). In the undepleted nutrient zone, extraradical hyphae infiltrate the soil and extend more widely (Bücking and Kafle 2015). From the undepleted nutrient zone, the hyphae absorb nutrients and supply them to the plant via the arbuscular membrane (Jakobsen and Hammer 2015). Under salinity stress, mycorrhizal plants absorb and accumulate more nutrients (such as phosphorus) from the soil than nonmycorrhizal plants do (Parihar and Bora 2019). Macromolecules such as lignin, chitin, protein, and nucleic acid are broken down into simple monomers, which are hydrolyzed by the hydrolytic enzymes produced by extraradical hyphae in the soil. Nutrients are absorbed as monomers more efficiently by AMF (Ma et al. 2015)."

This is due to early nodule senescence prompted by salinity stress (Matamoros et al. 2017), changes in formation of green pigments from leghemoglobin, damage to nitrogen fixation, and consequent acceleration of lytic activities (Savitha et al. 2016). The detrimental effects of salt on nodulation and nitrogen fixation in legumes is counteracted by application of AMF (Mia et al. 2014). It has been observed that AMF interaction can ameliorate drought stress–induced premature nodule senescence (Zahir et al. 2019). A resilience effect of a mycorrhizal booster on nodule development under salinity stress has been observed (Choudhary et al. 2016). The number of nodules and the colonization of legumes was observed to be increased by AMF (Mahdhi et al. 2017). A positive boost from AMF collaboration with nitrogen-fixing bacteria was observed in leguminous plants (Montaño et al. 2012). In mycorrhizal plants, higher leghemoglobin content was observed (Khatabi et al. 2019; Chandra and Singh 2016). In the synthesis of green pigments from leghemoglobin, a change of color in the nodule from pink to brownish pink was used to estimate the leghemoglobin content (Shahid et al. 2019). Higher nitrogenase activity occurs in mycorrhizal plants. Nodule interaction and mycorrhiza act synergistically to influence the infection rate, mineral nourishment, and plant growth (Muleta 2017; Zarea et al. 2011), which fulfill the requirement for both N and P, and improving plant tolerance of salt stress (Zhang et al. 2016a, b; Porcel et al. 2016)."

The protection against salt stress conferred by AMF has been attributed to increased uptake of nutrients as the result of interaction (Wu et al. 2010), osmoregulator accumulation, and increases in both water-use efficiency (WUE) and the rate of photosynthesis through a combination of nutritional effects (Waraich et al. 2011; Gattward et al. 2012), biochemical effects, and physiological effects, resulting in observations of salt stress alleviation in various studies (Katschnig et al. 2013).\nDuring salinity stress, alterations at the cellular, anatomical, and morphological levels are initiated by the plant itself to increase its capability to tolerate or avoid stress (Fahad et al. 2015a, b; Julkowska and Testerink 2015). These adaptations are not common in plants and are a dynamic consequence in several species of plants (Lämke and Bäurle 2017). To combat these stresses, in addition to inherent adaptations that can alleviate the effects of stress, several rhizospheric soil microorganisms display interactions (Singh et al. 2011). Photosynthetic efficiency, membrane integrity, and water status are physiological mechanisms that are disrupted by salinity effects (Evelin et al. 2009; Van Oosten et al. 2017). Salinity stress can be alleviated by enrichment of the physiological processes of plants by AMF, in addition to the aforementioned mechanisms (Parray et  al. 2016; Bhandari and Garg 2017). Colonization, spore germination, hyphal elongation, and growth of AMF (as well as that of host plants) have been shown to be hindered by salt stress (Lenoir et al. 2016; Mostofa et al. 2018). However, various studies have observed increased colonization and sporulation (Le Fevre et al. 2016). In saline and alkaline stress in soil, plant biomass, growth, elongation of roots and shoots, productivity, transformation of nutrients (Pii et al. 2015; Yadav et al. 2019d), production of phytohormones, water status, and various physiological and biochemical properties of plants can be increased by the interaction of mycorrhizal associations (Evelin et al. 2009; Chandra and Singh 2016). To protect plants from the adverse effects of salt stress, various approaches have been recommended (Fahad et al. 2015a, b; Jorge et al. 2016).\nNutrient enrichment in colonized plants is attributable not only to nutrient uptake via the mycorrhizal pathway but also to morphological and biophysical modifications that are indirectly due to root colonization (Delian et  al. 2011; Chen et  al. 2016). The rate of carbon dioxide exchange, transpiration, stomatal conductance, and WUE boost nutrient absorbency with truncated mobility of P, Zn, and Cu related to changes in physiological processes associated with upgraded halotolerance in mycorrhizal plants (Elhindi et  al. 2017; Augé et  al. 2016). Various studies have reported that plants that are not inoculated with AMF contain less water than those inoculated with AMF (Symanczik et al. 2018; Santander et al. 2017), in which low water potential is enhanced by the hydraulic conductivity of the root (Robbins and Dinneny 2015).\nP. Chandra et al.\n113\nA change in the morphogenetic atmosphere of the roots is associated with upgraded root conductance (Forni et al. 2017; Yadav et al. 2020d). The meristem activity of the root apexes is decreased by AMF, leading to an increase in the formation of adventitious roots, and these AMF-facilitated amendments in the morphology of roots may contribute to sustaining nutrient absorbance and water stability in the host plant under salt stress (Bahadur et al. 2019). Alterations in root systems in response to AMF- predominantly augmentations in branching and root system volume- have been reviewed (Sánchez-Bel et al. 2018; Schmidt and Gaudin 2017). In a salt-stressed ecosystem, water absorbency was augmented per unit of root length in colonized plants (Metwally and Abdelhameed 2018). Mycorrhizal colonization helps host plants to use water more efficiently and also allows maintenance of lower concentrations of carbon dioxide intercellularly, as manifested by several parameters (Yooyongwech et al. 2016). Consequently, in mycorrhizal plants, the capability for gas exchange increases (Romero-Munar et al. 2017), and fungi are considered to be bioameliorators of saline soils (Al-Amri et al. 2016)."

Thus, solubilization of phosphorus to overcome the P-binding capacity of the soil is necessary for the growth of the plant and helps to alleviate salt stress (Kour et al. 2020; Reynolds and Davies 2001; Reef et al. 2010). Phosphate concentrations in plants are increased by mycorrhizal inoculation, which augments uptake. This is facilitated by the widespread hyphae of the fungus, giving mycorrhizal plants access to a greater soil volume than nonmycorrhizal plants (Casieri et al. 2013). It has been estimated that up to 80% of a plant’s phosphorus requirement is fulfilled by external hyphae (Tarafdar and Marschner 1994). In saline soil with various levels of soil salinity (1.2, 4, 6.5, and 9.5 dS m−1), higher P content was observed in mycorrhizal Acacia nilotica plants (1.2, 1.2, 0.9, and 0.6%, respectively) than in nonmycorrhizal plants (0.6, 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1%, respectively) (Giri et al. 2007; Soliman et al. 2012).\nThe concentration of phosphorus in Trifolium alexandrium plants was found to be reduced with increasing levels of salinity (Shokri and Maadi 2009). It was also determined that as soil salinity increased from 2.2 to 5 and 10 dS m−1, P concentrations in shoots of nonmycorrhizal Trifolium alexandrium plants decreased from 0.41 to 0.36 and 0.28 mg L−1, respectively, while the respective concentrations in mycorrhizal plants were 0.68, 0.62, and 0.47 mg L−1 (Navarro et al. 2014; Alqarawi et al. 2014). In mycorrhizal plants, higher P absorption at all salinity levels showed that AMF increased P uptake in plants under saline conditions (Frosi et al. 2017; Evelin et al. 2009). In legumes, AMF-inoculated plants increased their growth rate, antioxidant production, and nodulation when the supply of phosphate nutrition was increased (Ashrafi et al. 2014; Veselaj et al. 2018). In AMF-inoculated plants grown in saline ecosystems, phosphate uptake was increased and vacuolar membrane integrity was maintained, while compartmentalization within vacuoles and ion uptake were selectively enhanced and negative effects of Na+ and Cl2 ions were\nP.

AMF can enhance absorption of nitrogen in host plants (Verzeaux et al. 2017), as shown by greater N accumulation in shoots of mycorrhizal Sesbania grandiflora and Sesbania aegyptiaca plants than in nonmycorrhizal control plants (Giri and Mukerji 2004) (Yadav et  al. 2020b, c). Inorganic nitrogen is absorbed from the soil in the form of nitrate by extraradical mycelia and assimilated by nitrate reductase sites on arbuscule cells (Toussaint et al. 2004), and arginine formation occurs via the glutamine synthetase–glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GS-GOGAT) cycle. In primary nitrogen fixation in extraradical mycelia, these processes are consistent with increased expression of enzymes involved in arginine catabolism (Bücking et al. 2012; Azcón-Aguilar and Barea 2015). Metabolism of nitrogen is changed by alterations in enzyme processes when absorption of nitrogen is increased in plants with AMF (Burns et al. 2013; Van Der Heijden et al. 2008). The toxic effects of Na+ ions are decreased with upgraded nitrogen nutrition and this indirectly helps to maintain chlorophyll content (Friedman 2002). Plants absorb nitrogen in the form of nitrate (NO32−) and ammonium (NH4+) ions, strongly affecting accumulation of Na+ ions (Giri and Mukerji, 2004; Kaushal and Wani 2016).

K+ ions are essential for various cellular functions and compete with Na+ ions (Rejili et al. 2007; Khan and Panda 2008). In plant metabolism, K+ activates a range of enzymes and plays a dynamic role in protein synthesis and the movement of stomata (Martinoia et al. 2006). In protein synthesis, K+ ions bind tRNA to ribosomes in high concentrations (Weinger et al. 2004). A high Na+:K+ ion ratio caused by salinity disrupts the ionic balance in the cytoplasm, disturbing various metabolic pathways (Tuteja 2007; Tester and Davenport 2003). The effect of salinity on K+ and Na+ nutrition in plants with AMF can be reversed through mycorrhizal colonization, improving the uptake of K+ ions in saline ecosystems (Tester and Davenport 2003; Estrada et al. 2013a, b, c) while preventing Na+ translocation to shoot tissues. Synthesis and storage of polyphosphate influence uptake of Na+ ions and other cations (Giri and Mukerji 2004) by amending expression and movement of K+ and Na+ transporters and of H+ pumps that produce the driving force for transportation of ions (Matsui and\n4 Soil Salinity and Its Alleviation Using Plant Growth–Promoting Fungi\n116\nHomareda 1982). The transfer of Na+ out of the cytoplasm into either vacuoles or the apoplasm is catalyzed through Na+/H+ antiporters (Bassil et al. 2012; Ouziad et al. 2006). Interruption of various K-mediated enzymatic developments and protein synthesis is prevented by a higher K+:Na+ ion ratio. The ionic balance of the cytoplasm or Na+ efflux from plants influences the high K+:Na+ ion ratio (Maathuis and Amtmann 1999; Wishnia et al. 1975). In mycorrhizal plants, in comparison with nonmycorrhizal plants, lower Na+ ion concentrations are also attributable to the dilution effect due to growth enhancement (Garg and Manchanda 2009). In mycorrhizal plants, Na+ concentrations are increased with increasing salinity up to a certain level but then successively diminish at higher concentrations of salinity (Chartzoulakis and Klapaki 2000). These observations suggest that AMF promote a buffering effect on uptake of Na+ ions when the Na+ content is within an acceptable limit (Onofre et al. 2015).\nThis also indicates an opportunity for a regulatory mechanism to function in the plant to contain Na+ ions. However, the uptake of P by mycorrhizal plants is diminished when salt concentrations are too high (9.5 dS m−1), because of the toxic effects of Na+ ions on fungal growth (Wang et  al. 2019), suggesting that mycorrhizal responses are only influential up to a certain level of salinity (4.7 dS m−1) (Elhindi et al. 2017)."

Chloride ions pass through the root via a simplistic pathway and are released from cells within the stele through specific anion channels to reach the xylem and then the shoots (Clarkson 1993). Accumulation of chloride ions greatly increases at high salt concentrations but remains constant in the root (Schachtman et al. 1989; Chen et al. 2002). High chloride ion concentrations can be toxic to crop plants and may restrict agriculture in saline regions where concentrations are higher (Chartzoulakis 2005). AMF can tackle this problem by reducing uptake of Cl2 ions (Evelin et al. 2009). In vacuolar membranes, Cl2 ions can be clustered in a way that inhibits them from interfering with metabolic pathways in the plant. However, some reports have indicated that Cl2 accumulation can actually be increased as a result of mycorrhizal colonization. This may be due to the carbon drain imposed by mycorrhizal hyphae on plants, which enhances translocation of highly mobile anions such as Cl2 from the soil (Elhindi et al. 2017; Evelin et al. 2009)."

However, in contrast to the above observations, the concentration of Ca2+ ions was found to remain unchanged in shoot tissues of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal Acacia auriculiformis plants (Kaya et al. 2009).

However, higher concentrations of these micronutrients are found in plants inoculated with rhizospheric fungi than in noninoculated plants (Richardson et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2013). This may be attributable to (1) a widespread root–hyphal system that shortens the path of nutrients entry into the plant; (2) the mycelium of fungi acting as a substrate for nutrients to bind to; (3) changes in the rhizosphere after introduction of AMF, influencing the solubility of nutrients and their ability to be absorbed; (4) an increase in the sink size of Cu and Zn due to higher shoot P concentrations, successively instigating uptake of nutrients and their translocation to the shoots (Maathuis et al. 2011); or (5) upregulation of expression of transporter genes for these nutrients.

In plants exposed to saline stress, a number of nitrogen-containing compounds accumulate. Amino acids, amide, and proteins are the most common, along with quaternary ammonium compounds (betaines) and polyamines (Mansour 2000).

Higher relative water content was observed in mycorrhizal Robinia pseudoacacia plants than in nonmycorrhizal plants under salt stress (Stratu et al. 2016).

Additionally, more compatible solutes were accumulated by mycorrhizal plants to adjust the osmotic potential and enable efficient water usage by the host plants (Juniper and Abbott 1993). In salt-stressed mycorrhizal plants, improved water status may be due to AMF-regulated expression of aquaporin genes present in the leaves and roots (Rapparini and Peñuelas 2014).\nHowever, each aquaporin gene in the roots of mycorrhizal plants may react differently to salt stress (Bárzana et  al. 2014). For instance, the LePIP1 gene was downregulated with AMF colonization in Lycopersicon esculentum, while the same gene was upregulated in Lactuca sativa (Ouziad et al. 2006; Jahromi et al. 2008).

The AMF symbiosis effect on transcription of aquaporin genes varies between different plant species, the type of plant tissue in which they are expressed, and the level of salinity (Ruiz-Lozano et al. 2012).

The plants must respond to the lower water potential to sustain a favorable gradient for water flow from the soil into the roots and to prevent dehydration of cells in this situation (Ruiz-Lozano et  al. 2006, 2012). Proline, betaine, polyamines, sugars, organic acids, amino acids, and osmolytes such as trehalose start to accumulate in the plants (Mansour 2000).

Furthermore, they are involved in ROS quenching and in maintaining membrane integrity, the enzyme balance, and the protein balance; thus, they are also known as osmoprotectants (Xiao et al. 2008)."

This suggests that the mycorrhizal plants had considerably lower root plasma membrane electrolyte permeability than the nonmycorrhizal plants. The membrane stability increase has been attributed to mycorrhiza-mediated increased uptake of phosphorus and increased antioxidant production (Chang et al. 2018; Evelin and Kapoor 2014)."

      "text" : "Plants must decrease their water potential to maintain a favorable gradient for water flow from the soil into the roots when the soil dries and the water potential reduces (Cook and Papendick 1972; Sharp and Davies 1985). Osmotic adjustment is promoted by the plants through active accumulations of organic ions or solutes, which mitigate the osmotic potential and counteract adverse effects (Eisa et al. 2012; Blum 2017). In plants grown in saline ecosystems, compatible osmolytes are commonly found—for example, nitrogen-holding complexes such as amino acids, amides, imino acids, ectoine (1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4-carboxylpyrimidine), proteins, quaternary ammonium complexes, low molecular weight sugars, organic acids, and polyols (Ciulla et  al. 1997; Slama et  al. 2015). Various biochemical changes are discussed briefly here. In plants’ reactions to salt stress, several compounds that accumulate are nitrogen-containing ones such as quaternary ammonium compounds (betaines) and polyamines, and also amino acids, amides, and proteins (Rhodes and Hanson 1993). These compounds are generally present in low concentrations when the plant is not under salt stress (Edreva et al. 2008; Sudha and Ravishankar 2002). The compounds that accumulate in saline ecosystems vary from species to species (Al Hassan et al. 2016) and are present in very low concentrations in the absence of salt stress (Wu et al. 1988). To maintain turgor and turgor-dependent processes such as photosynthesis and stomatal opening, growth and cellular expansion occur in cells by osmoregulation (Daie and Patrick 1988; Hsiao 1973)."

Proline is a nontoxic and defensive osmolyte, which maintains an osmotic balance under a lower water potential in saline ecosystems and is accumulated by various plants under saline conditions (Hayat et al. 2012; Hare et al. 1998). During salt stress, it\nP. Chandra et al.\n121\nacts as a pool of energy and nitrogen for utilization (Mansour 2000). When a plant is inoculated with AMF, proline accumulation has been found to increase. Vigna radiata and Glycine max (L.) mycorrhizal plants were shown to have higher proline content than nonmycorrhizal plants (Nadeem et  al. 2014; Kim et  al. 2012), and higher concentrations of proline were found in the roots and shoots of the plants. The osmotic balance between water-absorbing root cells and external media is maintained by the roots, which are the primary sites of water absorption (Bernstein and Hayward 1958; Sharifi et al. 2007). In contrast, more proline was found to accumulate in nonmycorrhizal Vicia faba plants than in mycorrhizal plants at various salinity levels (0–6 dS m−1). In less-salinity-tolerant plant species, proline accumulation may be a symptom of stress and its involvement in the adjustment of osmotic may be insignificant and associated with potassium ions (Chun and Chandrasekaran 2018). Accumulation of proline in response to salinity may not necessarily be due to mycorrhizal colonization (Porcel et al. 2012). In response to salinity, high levels of proline were shown to accumulate in Lotus glaber (Sanchez et al. 2005), and AMF influenced this proline accumulation. To determine the salt tolerance mechanisms operating in different plant systems, better explanations are needed (Andrade et al. 2009)."

They are also used as an indicator of salt stress (Juan et al. 2005; Tramontano and Jouve 1997). Betaines are simple nontoxic cellular osmolytes, improve the construction and actions of enzymes and complexes of proteins, and also maintain membrane integrity against the destructive effects of excess salt (Burg and Ferraris 2008; Papageorgiou and Murata 1995). When a plant is colonized by fungi, the accumulation of betaines is found to increase under salinity stress (Hameed et al. 2014).

Putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd), and spermine (Spm) are the three main polyamines in plants (Galston and Sawhney 1990). As a result of sequential accumulation of amino propyl groups, spermidine and spermine are synthesized from putrescine (Pál et al. 2018; Moschou et al. 2008). Putrescine is manufactured indirectly via decarboxylation of arginine and directly from ornithine decarboxylase\n4 Soil Salinity and Its Alleviation Using Plant Growth–Promoting Fungi\n122\n(Panagiotidis et  al. 1987). A significant role is played by these cations in plant responses to a wide collection of ecological stressors such as salt stress (Urano et al. 2004), high osmolarity (Rajam et  al. 1998), and antioxidative stress. Under salt stress conditions, they have been suggested to regulate root development (Sannazzaro et al. 2007) and pools of free polyamine have been observed to be reduced (Talaat and Shawky 2013). However, host plant inoculation with rhizofungi increases concentrations of free polyamines (Barea et al. 2005). In Lotus glaber plants colonized by Glomus intraradices, the total free polyamine pools were increased, as observed by Sannazzaro et al. (2007). Individual polyamines determine variations in response to salinity and mycorrhization, contingent on the genotype of the plant and the organ (root/shoot) being considered. Salt-tolerant genotypes of mycorrhizal Lotus glaber plants displayed higher levels of root spermine than nonmycorrhizal plants (Abdel-Fattah et al. 2016). Under salt stress, salt-sensitive Lotus glaber mycorrhizal plants exhibited higher root spermine, lower shoot and root putrescine, and lower spermidine levels than nonmycorrhizal plants (Talaat and Shawky 2015). Polyamine pool modulations may be one of the apparatuses used by AMF to increase plants’ adaptation to saline soils (Acosta-Motos et al. 2017; Augé et al. 2014)."

Using the addition of soluble sugars a significant plant protection mechanism formed by the osmotic potential of plants against salt stress (Ashraf and Harris 2004). With increased concentrations of NaCl, the soluble sugar content in Phragmites australis was found to be expressively increased (Li et al. 2019; Vilela and Barbosa 2019). Phragmites australis plants inoculated with Glomus fasciculatum had higher levels of soluble sugars than nonmycorrhizal plants (Nasim 2010). Sugar concentrations were increased in soybean roots inhabited by Glomus intraradices (St-Arnaud et al. 1995). The presence of mycorrhizae and sugar content were positively correlated as a result of the sink effect of the fungus obtaining sugars from the shoot tissues (Abbaspour et al. 2012; Ruiz-Lozano et al. 2012). The presence of carbon compounds in the root system of mycorrhizal host plants habitually leads to increased rates of photosynthesis involvement in the development process (Fitter 2002). As a result of hydrolysis of starch to sugars in seedlings immunized with mycorrhizae, sugar accumulation was found to be increased (Conrath 2009). Correlations between sugar accumulation and P concentration were observed in host plants grown in saline conditions (Hammer et al. 2011; Flowers et al. 2010).\nSoluble sugar concentrations were found to be higher in the roots of mycorrhizal maize plants than in those of nonmycorrhizal plants in spite of similar P concentrations (Feng et al. 2002). It was suggested that the higher soluble sugar concentrations in mycorrhizal roots were due to AMF settlement and not to an enhancement in the P status of the plants (Délano-Frier and Tejeda-Sartorius 2008; Mohammadi et al. 2011). Trehalose carbohydrate is a nonreducing disaccharide stored in AMF\nP. Chandra et al.\n123\nand plays a significant role as an abiotic stress protectant, stabilizing dehydrated enzymes and membranes, and protecting biological structures from drying damage (Redillas et al. 2012; Moussaid et al. 2015). It is also present in spores and in the extraradical mycelium of AMF (Hajiboland 2013). Trehalose is a rare sugar involved in AMF settlement and helps to defend plant roots against saline stress in higher vascular plants (Iordachescu and Imai 2011; Kosar et al. 2019). It is believed to possibly play a role in defending plants against abiotic stresses, as shown by the effect of salinity stress on trehalose content and metabolism in the extraradical hyphae of Glomus intraradices (Kaushal 2019). After treatment with 0.5 M NaCl in Glomus intraradices, no alteration in trehalose content was observed (Bencherif et al. 2019a, b; Liu et  al. 2014). Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase activations of moderate transient and neutral trehalase actions not associated with any transcriptional changes have been detected (Zhou et al. 2014).\nIn extraradical hyphae and mycorrhizal roots, trehalose accumulation is of interest and may influence the response of AMF to stress environments, with trehalose being used as a stress defense agent (Kravić et al. 2013; Maralian et al. 2010). A substantial role in alteration of hyperosmotic conditions in symbiotic bacteria is played by trehalose metabolism (Reina-Bueno et al. 2012). This molecule plays a part in initiating tolerance of salt stress (Ghosh et  al. 2011). Consequently, the potential of trehalose in protecting cells from salt stress needs to be determined (Mostofa et al. 2015). A reduction in carbohydrate concentrations with proliferation in the percentage of root colonization has been determined (Zangaro et al. 2012). In the responses to salinity of soybean plants colonized by Glomus etunicatum, no role of soluble carbohydrates was detected (Dodd and Pérez-Alfocea 2012)."

Proteins, lipids, and DNA react with all activated oxygen species and when defensive mechanisms are deficient, cell structure and function can be damaged (Birben et al. 2012). Plants released antioxidants and enzymes from oxidative destruction which used as defense mechanisms. Thus, defensive mechanisms are found in plants outflow from oxidative destruction connecting antioxidant fragments and enzymes (Grassi et al. 2010). Correlations between antioxidant capability and NaCl tolerance have been established in various plant species (Arbona et al. 2013; Ashraf et al. 2012). Maximum antioxidant concentrations providing plants with more resistance to oxidative impairment have been determined (de Bernonville et  al. 2010). Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APOX), glutathione reductase (Wang 2011), dehydroascorbate, monodehydroascorbate reductase (Yin et al. 2010; Eltelib et  al. 2011), guaiacol peroxidase, oxidized glutathione (Bela et  al.\n4 Soil Salinity and Its Alleviation Using Plant Growth–Promoting Fungi\n124\n2015), glutathione peroxidase, and enzymes involved in the ascorbate–glutathione cycle are considered to be antioxidants (Caverzan et al. 2012; Joseph et al. 2011).\nActivated oxygen species such as carotenoids, glutathione, tocopherols, and ascorbic acid are scavenged by nonenzymatic compounds (Carocho and Ferreira 2013). AMF symbiosis helps plants to alleviate salt stress by enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, as shown by various observations (Estrada et al. 2013a, b, c; Ruiz-Lozano et al. 2012). In mycorrhizal plants, these advanced antioxidant enzymes indomitable comparison to the non-mycorrhizal plants observed in various studies (Zhu et  al. 2010). Higher antioxidant activities of SOD, peroxidase, and APOX have been observed in mycorrhizal soybean plants than in nonmycorrhizal plants (Gong et al. 2015). SOD helps to detoxify superoxide into hydrogen peroxide (Rodrigues and Gomes 2010). CAT and peroxidase detoxify hydrogen peroxide (Ramos et al. 2014). Detoxification of hydrogen peroxide produced in the chloroplasts of stressed host plants by APOX has also been reported (Liang et al. 2013). Increased glutathione reductase activity may assist nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) to receive electrons resulting from photosynthetic electron transport, thereby attracting electrons away from oxygen and reducing the production of O2 (Jing et al. 2011; Yamamori et al. 2012)."

They are derived via biosynthetic pathways in plants and can act at the site of production or away from it. Abscisic acid (ABA), auxins, brassinosteroids (BRs), cytokinins (CKs), gibberellins (GAs), jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), strigolactones (SLs), nitric oxide (NO), and triazoles are phytohormones known to play substantial roles in communicating salt stress tolerance in plants (Hilbert et al. 2012). Hormonal interactions between them modify biological and physiological processes, translating into mediation of growth, development, nutrient allocation, and source/sink transitions in response to environmental stimuli (Lüttge 2013). Furthermore, ABA, auxins, JA, and SA are known to act as signaling molecules in AMF symbiosis (Miransari et al. 2014; Martínez-Medina et al. 2011). Consequently, it is assumed that these hormones reduce soil salinity and play significant roles in improving plant growth (Paul and Lade 2014; Yaish et al. 2015). A newly recognized class of phytohormones is strigolactones, which are involved in various characteristics of plant development such as root growth coordination and shape, access to soil nutrients, secondary branch suppression in shoots, influence on internode length in cross talk with auxin, leaf senescence regulation, and induction of AMF symbiosis (Koltai and Kapulnik 2011).\nH2O2 accumulation depends on reduced NADP+ (NADPH) oxidase activities, which play an important role in ABA signaling (Ishibashi et al. 2010).

AMF colonization was shown to have a positive influence on endogenous concentrations of GA (Kiers et al. 2010; Jung et al. 2012).

In response to salt stress in the shoot apical meristems of canola, increases in plasmodesmata numbers, cytoplasm vacuolization, and thickening of cell walls have been observed (Rewald et al. 2013). In Arabidopsis thaliana, as a result of dissipation of mitochondrial membranes, potential disruptions in thylakoid and thylakoid membranes and induction of ovule abortion have been observed (Waraich et al. 2012; Cossani and Reynolds 2012). Consequently, ROS accumulate in the cells of gametophytes, gradually leading to programmed cell death (Xie et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2013). Aborting gametophytes are produced from the concentric rings of endoplasmic reticulum, surrounding chloroplasts, mitochondria, microbodies, and cytoplasm due to the accumulation of ROS (Perry et al. 2011). The cytoplasmic content and organelles were invaginated into the vacuole. Antioxidant activities are increased in plants by inoculation with AMF (Yang et al. 2014a, b; Hoeksema et al. 2010), and AMF can be applied to neutralize the actions of ROS and alleviate salt stress (Estrada et al. 2013a, b, c; Filippou et al. 2013).\nExpression of a few proteins such as Na+/H+ antiporters, D1-pyrroline-5carboxylate synthetase (LsP5CS), late embryogenesis abundant protein (LsLea), and ABA (Lsnced) has been the focus of various molecular inventions (Vaseva et al. 2010; Shu et al. 2013).

Pathogens causing disease in plants affect such a relationship by influencing plant defense, fitness, hindering plant growth, and sustainability greatly impacting plant ecosystem and population (Creissen et  al. 2016). Over 100 different diseases affect crop plants. While, only a single pathogen under given circumstances multiplies enough to become a disease causing agent. These crop plant diseases falls among the biggest hurdles limiting the production of large and adequate quantities of food (Savary et al. 2012). It is estimated that various plant diseases at different planting stages and plant pests are responsible for half of the total agricultural production loss in the world (Khan 2008).\nS. Sikandar (*) · A. Y. Saqib · I. Afzal (*) Department of Biology, Lahore Garrison University, Lahore, Pakistan\n150\nPlant disease can be defined as “a physiological disorder or structural abnormality that is harmful to the plant or to any of its parts or products that reduces the economic value” (Stalkman and Harrar 1957). Phytopathogenic agents are responsible for significant loss of crops resulting from plant diseases. In order to sustain the standard and diversity of feed, food and fiber all over the globe, plant diseases need to be eradicated and controlled. For this purpose, various approaches for plant disease control have been proposed. Apart from efficient horticulture and agronomical applications, often producers are heavily reliant upon chemically synthesized pesticides and fertilizers, while, the environmental pollution and fluctuations resulting from these synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, and agrochemicals have caused significant changes over their use in agriculture, plant disease control and prevention (Kaur et al. 2020; Kour et al. 2020; Singh and Yadav 2020). Biological control of fungal plant pathogens is of great interest and in recent times, more emphasis is provided as potential alternatives to the chemical use (Rastegari et al. 2020b; Yadav et al. 2020b, e; Vinale et al. 2014). Synthetically produced pesticides are expensive, pollutants of environment and hazardous to humans and animals as well. Moreover, repeated exposure of such chemicals enhances the stride of resistant pathogenic strains. Pest management mediated by microbes is among the most efficient and inexpensive biological control applications in agriculture (Rana et al. 2019; Verma et al. 2017; Yadav 2019).\nOutcome of such an approach is largely based upon the choice of microbial strain. The benefits for the plant associated involve: (1) plant growth promotion; (2) establishment of microbial community within the rhizosphere involving antagonistic activity; (3) pathogen elimination; (4) plant health benefits; (5) greater uptake and availability of nutrients, and (6) improved biotic and abiotic stress resistance to host (Harman et  al. 2004; Vinale et  al. 2008; Yadav et  al. 2017). Advantageous microbes have been known to have various mode of action such as: pathogen inhibition or parasitism using antibiotics sometimes in conjugation with cell wall decomposing extracellular enzymes; contention for nutrients (i.e., carbon, iron or nitrogen) in sites of colonization; onset of plant developmental and resistance phenomenon (Kour et al. 2020; Howell 2003; Whipps 2001). Microbial species, particularly of fungi, secrete diverse range of secondary metabolites involving a variety of industrially and economically important compounds (Herbert 1989; Yadav et al. 2019b). Chemically, secondary metabolites are naturally different compounds characterized by low molecular weight usually, less than 3 kDa.\nSecondary metabolites are assigned to each specific genera, strain or species being mainly synthesized by plants and microorganisms (Rastegari et  al. 2019b; Yadav et  al. 2019a). Their biosynthesis involves primary metabolites in specific pathways such as mevalonate or polyketide pathways driven through amino acids or Acetyl Coenzyme A along with a few clustered genes. Some global regulators appear to be the gene expression inducers of such genes (Herbert 1989; Rastegari et  al. 2019a). Secondary metabolites exhibit several biological functions in relevance to survival of organisms (Yadav et al. 2020a). For instance, metal transportation, symbiotic association, and contention with both micro and macroorganisms. Secondary metabolite synthesis in fungi is often held parallel to distinct phases of\nS. Sikandar et al.\n151\nstructural differentiation along with active growth phase (Keller et al. 2005). Their range of distribution varies from among a few related species to individual strains emphasizing diverse activities of each metabolite in contrast to a universal activity (Keller et al. 2005).\nSecondary metabolites of fungal origin display various biological features while offering essential regulatory interactions among organisms (Hanson 2003; Yadav et al. 2019b). For example, mycotoxins (toxic secondary metabolite produced by fungi colonizing crops causing disease and death in animals and humans), phytotoxins (secondary metabolite that invades the plant defense), antibiotics (compounds possessing inhibitory and antimicrobial activities), and pigments (colored compounds involving antioxidant features) (Chiang et al. 2009; Vinale et al. 2014; Yadav et al. 2019c) (Fig. 5.1). However, interestingly, a few secondary metabolites of fungal origin possess the ability to alter plant growth and metabolism while others act on specialized fungal phenomenon including hyphal elongation, growth, and sporulation (Keller et al. 2005). Soil borne fungal species thrive in extremely competent environments. Virtually every fungal community is known to have antagonistic relationship among natural competing fungal species (Ghisalberti 2002). Fungi known to be invasive function indirectly or directly towards fungal phytopathogens. Indirectly by facing contention for physical space and nutrient availability, altering\n5 Fungal Secondary Metabolites and Bioactive Compounds for Plant Defense\n152\nenvironmental circumstances or by enhancing plant growth. Fungi are also known by its defense and antibiosis mechanisms and by the processes like mycoparasitism against phytopathogens (Yadav et al. 2019d, 2020d). This influence is attained by production of a great variety of secondary metabolites, evolving a wide array of natural and xenobiotics, developing altered degradative enzymes like chitinase (Gloer 1997; Kumar et al. 2019a). Biological activities having integral impact on crop regulation and production are greatly influenced by fungal metabolites."

Bacterial biocontrol agents include Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp., and Agrobacterium sp., while, biocontrol agents of fungal origin are Aspergillus spp., Candida sp., Ampelomyces sp., Coniothyrium sp., Trichoderma spp., and Gliocladium sp. (Atehnkeng et al. 2008; Gilardi et al. 2008; Koumoutsi et al. 2004; Mavrodi et al. 2002; Papavizas 1985). Among these, Trichoderma sp. stands out as the most versatile and diverse fungal biocontrol agent mainly towards pathogenic fungi. Various studies claimed Trichoderma spp. as an effective biocontrol weapon against pant diseases (Sharma et al. 2019; Yadav et al. 2020c). Commercially available Trichoderma products as biopesticides are in use presently that alter the soil properties enhancing plant growth promotion (Chet 1987; Harman et al. 2004; Papavizas 1985; Vinale et al. 2008). In 1934, Trichoderma lignorum was utilized as biocontrol agent against the fungal plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani by Weindling (1934). Similarly, Trichoderma lignorum displayed mycoparasitic features towards Rhizopus, Phytophthora, Sclerotium rolfsii, and Pythium (Wells 1988). Many diverse secondary metabolites are also reported from Trichoderma spp., which has therefore drawn great interest in fungus being designated as a biocontrol model (Chet 1993; Chet et al. 1981; Rastegari et al. 2020a) (Table 5.1).\nPresently, mankind faces huge challenges in the form of environmental degradation, deterioration of land, water and loss of biological diversity (Kour et al. 2019; Kumar et al. 2019b). Secondary metabolites, therefore, hold great potential in rectifying these challenges of nature. Fungi secrete a great number of diverse bioactive secondary metabolites with broad range of functions (Fig. 5.2). Major categories of natural products from fungal origin include antioxidants, antidiabetics, antibiotics, insecticides, and immunosuppressant of various chemical characters (Rana et  al. 2020; Singh et al. 2020).

A novel daucane (carotene) metabolite (1) (Fig.  5.3) from one of the strains of T. virens showed antifungal properties against a number of dermatophytes and yeast with significant effect recorded on C. albicans (Watanabe et al. 1990). T. virens was also reported as a source of four novel metabolites with carotene backbone, trichocaranes A, B, C, and D (2–5) (Fig. 5.3). The structure of each trichocarane was confirmed by mass spectroscopy and NMR emphasizing each compound remarkably inhibited the growth rate of etiolated wheat coleoptiles (Macias et al. 2000).\nNumerous sesquiterpenes from endophytic fungi have also been identified. Two caryophyllene (pestalotiopsin A and B) along with a novel 2α-hydroxydimeninol (6–8) (Fig. 5.4) sesquiterpenes from Pestalotiopsis spp. that forms an endophytic relationship with Taxus brevifolia evaluated by spectral and X-ray diffraction analysis (Pulici et  al. 1996a, b). Sesquiterpenes are also known to exhibit insecticidal properties. For instance, toxicity against the larvae of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) of Phyllosticta sp., that involves an endophytic association with Abies balsamea from the family Pinaceae by the action of heptelidic and hydroheptelidic acid (9–10) (Fig. 5.5) (Calhoun et al. 1992).\nEpichloë typhina, a species of fungus of cool season grass that is endophytic in nature on plant Phleum pretense.

Most of these compounds displayed varying levels of both antibacterial and antifungal characteristics against different types of pathogens (Wu et al. 2011). The medicinal plant Costus speciosus is host to fungal endophyte Bipolaris sorokiniana identified to yield helminthosporal acid (16) and helminthosporol (17), two quite rare sesquiterpenes (Fig.  5.8). Compound 16 exhibited antifungal activity (Qader et  al. 2017). Helminthosporol (17) has also been reported from Drechslera dematioidea obtained from Liagora viscida, red algae of marine origin (Osterhage et  al. 2002). Helminthosporol (17) is also experimented to show elongation effect upon the shoots of rice seedlings (Tamura et al. 1965).\n5 Fungal Secondary Metabolites and Bioactive Compounds for Plant Defense\n156"

Plate tests evaluation effects against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Lycopersici and Rhizoctonia solani have also been investigated. An addition of this compound in agar medium resulted in growth reduction of F. oxysporum and R. solani within 48 h by 69.6% and 31.7%, respectively, to an amount of 0.3  mg/ml. Complete spore germination was halted at 0.45 mg/ml when spore germination tests were performed against the spores of Fusarium. Similarly, Poole et al. identified the control against Botrytis cinerea causing rots of stored kiwi fruits (Poole et al. 1998).\nMassoilactone and delta-decanolactone (19–20) (Fig. 5.9) have been patented (Hill et al. 1995) due to their broad range of controlling plant disorders caused by Phytophthora and Botrytis species as they involve the ability to halt the growth at 62–250 μg/ml of S. aureus and at 31–125 μg/ml of A. niger and C. albicans. This is\nS. Sikandar et al.\n159\nachieved by adopting 96 well equipped microbioassay and agar dilution method (Kishimoto et al. 2005). T. viridae has been identified as a source of viridepyronone (21) (Fig. 5.9) showing in vitro inhibitory effects of over 90% against Sclerotium rolfsii (Evidente et al. 2003). Studies conducted on 6-(1′-pentenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one (22) (Fig. 5.9) displayed inhibitory effects to Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Penicillium spp., and Aspergillus fumigatus isolated from two strains of T. harzianum (Claydon et al. 1987; Parker et al. 1997). In vitro antibiotic response from cytosporone S (pyrone) (23) (Fig. 5.9) has been reported against numerous fungi and bacteria as well from a Trichoderma sp. strain as the source (Ishii et al. 2013). Similarly, novel polyketide terpene metabolites (24–26) (Fig.  5.10) from endolichenic fungus belonging to Pestalotiopsis sp. showed potential as antifungal agents capable of being employed in crop and agricultural protection practices. Compounds 24 and 25 inhibited the plant pathogen fungus F. oxysporum, while compounds 25 and 26 inhibited the growth of F. gramineum at an MIC of 8 ug/ml (Yuan et al. 2017).\nHormonema dematioides endophytic to balsam fir, produces a quinone compound rugulosin (27) (Fig.  5.11) exhibiting insecticidal activity (Calhoun et  al. 1992). A quinone 1′,5′-trihydroxy-3′,4′dihydro-1′H-[2,4′]binaphthalenyl-1,4,2′trione (28) (Fig. 5.11) elicited from an endophytic fungi of Larix laricina needle displays toxicity towards the larvae of spruce budworm (Findlay et  al. 1997). Similarly, Alternaria spp. and Phoma sp. in conjugation with plants secrete hydroxyl quinone altersolanol A (29) (Fig.  5.11) with antibacterial characteristics (Yang et al. 1994).\nAnthraquinones pachybasin, chrysophanol, and emodin (30–32) (Fig. 5.11) have been reported from wild T. viridae strain sampled from soil (Slater et al. 1967). The mixture of these compounds along with their O-acetyl and O-methyl derivatives towards two F. annosus strains resulted in a linear reduction of fungal growth in particular when O-acetyl derivatives were employed (Donnelly and Sheridan 1986).\n5 Fungal Secondary Metabolites and Bioactive Compounds for Plant Defense\n160\nEmodin (32) is known to have the activities of tyrosine kinase (Jayasuriya et al. 1992; Kumar et al. 1998) and monoamine oxidase (Fujimoto et al. 1998).\nBlennoria sp. exhibiting endophytic relation to Carpobrotus edulis has been reported as a source of secalonic acid B (33) (Fig. 5.12), blennolides A, B, D, and E\nS.

Compounds 36 and 37 showed appreciable antialgal and antifungal properties (Zhang et al. 2008).\nCompounds 38 and 39 (Fig. 5.13) obtained from fungal culture of Coniothyrium sp., an endophyte of Salsola oppostifolia is known to have notable effects against Botrytis cinerea and M. violaceum (Sun et al. 2013). Javanicin (40), a naphthoquinone counterpart (Fig.  5.13), was identified from Fusarium sp. (Kornsakulkarn et al. 2011) and as well as Chloridium sp. It is known to inhibit the fungal growth of Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Cercospora arachidicola (Kharwar et al. 2009). Similarly, Delitschia corticola secretes a series of naphthoquinone 6-ethyl-7-hydroxyl-2-methoxyjuglone (41), 6-ethyl-2,7-dimethoxyjuglone (42), and 6-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2,7-dimethoxyjuglone (43) (Fig. 5.13) displaying antifungal activity against Fusarium sp., Alternaria sp., and Sclerotium sp. (Sun et al. 2011). The depsidones called cordycepsidone A (44) (Fig. 5.13) was reported to exhibit strong antifungal characteristics against fungus known to be plant pathogens viz., Gibberella fujikuroi with intermediate effects towards Pythium ultimum with the fungus Cordyceps dipterigena as a source (Varughese et al. 2012). Pyrenocine analogs called phomopsinones A and D (45–46) (Fig. 5.14) are reported from Phomopsis sp. that resides as an endophytic fungus on Santolina chamaecyparissus (Hussain et al. 2012b). Phomopsinone A (45) showed strong antifungal properties against plant and crop pathogens Pyricularia oryzae, Septoria tritici, and\n5 Fungal Secondary Metabolites and Bioactive Compounds for Plant Defense\n162\nB. cinerea. Phomopsinone D (46) is reported to only inhibit the growth of B. cinerea and S. tritici. In the same way, four pyrocine counterparts were isolated from the fungus belonging to Phomopsis sp., endophyte of Cistus salvifolius (Hussain et al. 2012a). Out of these four, pyrenocines K (48) and M (49) (Fig. 5.14) displayed antifungal effects against M. violaceum and S. tritici, whereas, pyrenocine J (47) (Fig. 5.14) was antifungal only against S. tritici. Phomochromone A (50) and B (51) (Fig.  5.15), two novel chromones were reported from Phomopsis sp. displaying appreciable antifungal, antibacterial, and antialgal properties when tested against S. tritici, B. cinerea, B. megaterium, M. violaceum and also against E. coli and C. fusca (Ahmed et al. 2011).\nMellein (52) (Fig.  5.14), an isocoumarin analog isolated from Pezicula sp., inhibits B. cinerea and Fulvia fulva with EC50 values of less than 50 μg/ml (Wang et  al. 2014).

C. rosea imparts antibacterial activity due to the action of TMC-151 type polyketides (Zhai et al. 2016). On the other hand, T. ophioglossoides is responsible for eliciting two antibacterial and antifungal compounds: the NRPS/PKS enzyme hybrid driven ophiosetin and polyketide ophiocordin (Kneifel et al. 1977; Putri et al. 2010; Quandt et al. 2016). The pks4 deletion in Fusarium spp. which codes for aurofusarin and bikaverin orthologue for polyketides synthases, resulted in considerable alterations of metabolism, morphology, and physiology in T. reesei. Inhibition of teleomorph structures and conidia pigmentation were evaluated along with reduced stability of cell wall in conidia in delta-pks4 mutants. Deletion of the of the mutant Pks4 caused a decrease in hostile characteristics in confrontation estimation assays of T. reesei, decreased the antifungal properties induced by polar soluble and resilient metabolites along with altered gene expression of other polyketide synthases (Atanasova et al. 2013).\n5 Fungal Secondary Metabolites and Bioactive Compounds for Plant Defense\n164"

Neither endophytic fungal cultures nor the infected grasses separately produced lolines in vitro (Schardl and Phillips 1997). Emphasizing, secretion only took place during plant-endophyte interaction. Lolines are diverse insecticides playing the role of metabolic toxicants and feeding repellents. The allelopathic phenomenon when grasses reside as host is credited to certain endophyte secreted loline counterparts (Bush et  al. 1997). For instance, F. pratensis when infected by N. uncinatum and N. coenophialum infecting Festuca arundinacea distinctively produces lolines (56). These are also\nS. Sikandar et al.\n165\nrelatively lesser toxicants when made a comparison with indole diterpene alkaloids and ergot alkaloids.\nSecondary metabolites classified under amine and amides have been identified from Neotyphodium, also referred as Epichloë and the grass endophytes from the genus Acremonium (Glenn et al. 1996; Schardl and Phillips 1997). Peramine (57), a pyrrolopyrazine (Fig. 5.15) classified alkaloid is reportedly secreted by E. typhina, Neotyphodium coenophialum, N. lolli, and Epichloë festucae within the culture, in leaves of taller fescue, ryegrass and as well as in plants having association with the stem while being a toxicant against insects such as Argentine stem weevil having no hazardous influence on mammals (Dew et al. 1990; Rowan and Latch 1994). Ras farnesyl transferase is known to be inhibited due to the production of 1-N-methylalbonoursin (58) (Fig. 5.17) from Phoma sp. (Ishii et al. 2000). Secretion of Indole alkaloids like elymoclavine, agroclavine, and chanoclavine (59–61) (Fig. 5.17) providing toxicity against some insects and mammals are reported from Neotyphodium (Powell and Petroski 1992; Schardl and Phillips 1997). Neotyphodium endophytes provides plant hosts with numerous advantages like enhanced growth rate, increased reproduction, and herbivores resistance using endophyte alkaloids (Clay and Schardl 2002; Faeth 2009; Müller and Krauss 2005).\nCavendishia pubescens tree bark isolated Phomopsis sp. and indole byproducts like tremorgenic aspalitrems A (62) and C (63) (Fig.  5.18) of Aspergillus flavus are produced by the endophyte (Bills et al. 1992). Similarly, 3-IAA (64) (Fig. 5.18) of auxin class is produced by Artemisia annua residing Epicoccum purpurascens, Aureobasidium pullulans, Colletotrichum sp., and Acremonium coenophialum endophytes. Tobacco isolated strains of Hypoxylon serpens elicites IAA, cytokinins with 3-indoleacetonitrile (65) (Fig.  5.18) (Petrini 1991).\n5 Fungal Secondary Metabolites and Bioactive Compounds for Plant Defense\n166\n6-isoprenylindole-3-carboxylic acid (66), an indole byproduct (Fig. 5.18), has been identified from Colletotrichum sp. endophyte to Artemisia. annua. This derivative is hostile towards pathogenic bacteria and as well as phytopathogenic fungi such as Rhizoctonia cerealis, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, and Phytophthora capsici (Lu et al. 2000). A 4-year long field experiment examined alkaloids associated infection on Achnatherum robustum, the sleepygrass. Results emphasized the potential of alkaloidal infection in protection from extreme winter circumstances and underground herbivore antagonism (Faeth et al. 2010).\nPyridine ring containing metabolites of fungal origin exist with 2,3-dimethoxy4-pyridinol structure (Fig. 5.19). For example, harzianopyridone (67) (Fig. 5.19) obtained from T. harzianum whose racemic structure display huge antifungal potential towards Pythium ultimum, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, Botrytis cinerea, and Rhizoctonia solani (Dickinson et al. 1989; Vinale et al. 2006). On the other hand, remarkable phytotoxic effects were observed in etiolated wheat coleoptile bioassay with marginal antibacterial and antifungal characteristics from the laevorotatory form Cutler and Jacyno (1991). This form of compound 67 was also shown to elicit necrosis among corn, tobacco, and bean in accordance to the concentration. Thus, signifying the potential of harzianopyridone (67) enantiomers to exhibit altering characteristics (Sivasithamparam and Ghisalberti 1998). Penta-substituted ring structure of pyridine is reportedly involved in WF-16775 A2 (68) (Fig.  5.19) obtained by Chaetasbolisia erysiophoides (Otsuka et al. 1992), piericidin A (69) (Fig.  5.19) isolated from Streptomyces mobaraensis and S. pactum (Jansen and Höfle 1983; Takahashi et  al. 1965) and atpenin compounds (70–72) (Fig.  5.19) secreted from Penicillium sp.

ATF-451 strain of Trichoderma was reported to produce melanoxadin (73) and melanoxazal (74), oxazole byproducts (Fig. 5.20) from the post fermentation cultural broth. Significant inhibition potential has been reported towards mushroom tyrosinase from melanoxazal (74) while the silkworm Bombyx mori had inhibited melanin production within the hemolymph larval fluid from both compounds (73–74) (Hashimoto et al. 1995; Takahashi et al. 1965). Harzianic acid (75) (Fig. 5.20) consisting of a pirrolidindione ring structure is identified from a strain of T. harzianum subjected to fermentation (Sawa et al. 1994). Harzianic acid have also been found from F-1531 fungal strain along with dimethyl harzianic (76) and homoharzianic (77) acids (Fig. 5.20) (Kawada et al. 2004).

      "text" : "Endophytes are the hidden microflora that live inside the plant for a part or lifetime within the plant tissue and promote the plant to fight against odd conditions like physiological stress, microorganism attacks, thus produce a wide range of bioactive compounds with deep industrial or agricultural application (Yadav et al. 2020a, d). Endophytes have been exploited for their novel bioactive compound production for a long time but in recent past emphasis has been given by the endophyte biologist regarding their use in agricultural sectors for minimizing the crop loss caused by fungal pathogenic attack as well as insect, burrowing nematode, flies, and moth infections (Rana et al. 2019). It has been evidenced by scientists from all over the world that endophyte has been proved to be an appropriate agent in this respect and due to its organic origin the products are found to be biodegradable and does not hamper the natural sustainability at all (Yadav et al. 2019a, b). So nowaday the trend has been shifted to endophytes with mycofumigating or biocontrol ability for minimizing the use of chemical insecticides or fungicides. Some endophytic genus like Muscodor albus is reported to be the storehouse of a wide and diverse range of volatile bioactive product with anti-pathogenic activity and this volatile antimicrobial producing endophyte is widely used in agricultural lands for minimizing fungal pathogen mediated crop loss or for reducing the economic loss caused by the fungal toxins during food transport or storage.\nThe isolation of novel endophyte is dependent on the screening of plant as plants with particular odor or inhabiting in tropical rain forest are known to harbor greater diversity of endophytic genus as those environments are supportive for endophytes survival. As they share necessary characters with their host plants they are easy to exploit for bioactive compound production (Rastegari et al. 2020a, b; Yadav et al. 2020b, c). The crying need of this modern era of science is the maintenance of sustainability on the one hand and development of biological tools with no negative impact on environment for solving the fungal pathogenesis issues on the other hand. Fungal pathogens are known to be the prime agent for agricultural crop loss. This chapter summarizes the remarkable scientific works related to the endophytic fungi with their biocontrol ability on common and severe dreadful agricultural pathogens in vitro and in vivo conditions.\nH.

Plant parts are cut into small pieces and surface sterilized using sodium hypochlorite or 80% ethanol and immediately flamed in spirit lamp for 5–10 s. Then they are plated on water agar medium supplemented with 2% of agar (Fig. 6.1). After proper incubation at 28 °C for 24–72 h when the first hyphae comes out from the plant segments they are immediately transferred to a medium containing selective media supplemented with antibacterial streptomycin\n6 Fungal Endophytes: A Source for Biological Control Agents\n184\nand potato dextrose agar as growth substance. After successful isolation they are identified by their microscopic morphology (scanning electron micrographs are also taken), colony characters, and using molecular biology methods (Fig.  6.1). The endophytic isolates are then tested for their antagonistic ability by dual culture plate assay and the diameters of the both the pathogen and the fungal growth are recorded and the clear zone of inhibition is recorded, this is called as antagonistic activity of the endophytic fungal isolates (Fig. 6.1). Next the potent isolates are screened for their culture broth assay.\nThe fungal blocks are transferred to the culture broth provided with potato dextrose medium and agitated in 120 rotations per minute (rpm) in shaker incubator. The culture broth are filtrated and mixed with ethyl acetate and bioactive compounds are extracted. The extracted liquid is tested for their antifungal activity in agar well diffusion technique and the clear zone of inhibition is measured immediately after 12 h of incubation. The antifungal compounds are isolated using purification techniques based on column chromatographic procedures and further identification is done by IR spectral analysis and using HPLC technique (Fig. 6.1). For the detection of volatile antifungal emissions of the endophytic isolates split plate assay is performed where at one side endophytes is placed and on the other side the targeted pathogen is inoculated and on successful volatile emission the pathogen growth would be inhibited (Fig.  6.1). The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are recorded using the GC-MS instrument. The volatiles are detected by growing the fungal mycelium on specialized GC vials and then finally comparing the chromatographic spectra with the NIST library (Fig. 6.2). The chemical compounds are checked in vitro or in vivo using standards and they are noted as the bioactive chemicals of endophytic origin (Fig. 6.3)."

Reports include the inhibition of mycelial growth of the Fusarium oxysporum F.sp. Cubense, the causal agent of panama disease by the endophytes (Pocasangre 2000). The endophytes are also reported to inhibit the growth of the burrowing nematode Radopholus similis that causes potential damage in banana plant crop production. So use of endophyte for the control of nematode and pathogenic fungus is a new approach.\nPederson and his co-workers in the year of 1988 worked on the effect of endophytic fungus (Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams) of tall fescue on the behavior of the nematodes associated with the host plant’s infection. They reported that the removal of endophyte from the plant Festuca arundinacea Schreb.

After 7 weeks of continuous growth in pots of green house with a soil of sandy or fine loam infected with huge numbers of phytonematodes they ended up with the conclusion that nematode infection sensitive soybean plants are not affected and their growth or annual production is not affected but tall fescue stand decline has occurred.\n6 Fungal Endophytes: A Source for Biological Control Agents\n186\nH.

      "text" : "Incognita by Lolium perenne Endophytes\nStewart and his scientific partners in the year of 1993 worked on the infection of Meloidogyne naasi Franklin on endophyte infected as well as non-endophyte infected perennial rye grass and evaluated the gall formation (in quantitative measurement) and proliferation of this gall forming nematode. Lolium perenne L. is globally called as the Perennial rye grass and has been a major plant of New Zealand. Earlier reports include that this plant is susceptible to the infection of gall forming nematode (Sheridan and Grbavac 1979). Acremonium spp. has been reported to protect rye grass from Argentine stem weevil pathogen but there had been no previous report on the effect of this endophytic species on gall formation mediated by M. naasi (Popay and Mainland 1991). Seeds of the experimental grass were sown in 5 cm pots filled with 50:50 mixtures of silt-loam soil and sand (pasteurized) and thinned to individual pots after germination. Occurrence of endophyte was confirmed microscopically by staining of leaf sheath with lacto-phenol cotton blue. Infection procedure includes the application of 3  mL water to all the plants by syringe into a pencil hole made on the plant body after 21 days of complete emergence. Ten endophyte infected and ten free pots were provided with nematode inoculum and the other set got only water. Final observation was made after the proper supply of nutrients and maintenance of the plants in glass house at 18–24 °C and separation of root from soil followed by the counting of number of galls per root sample. Not only the number of gall decreased but also the number of females present in each root sample of the endophyte treated plants was lesser in number in comparison to the endophyte treated one. Absence of juvenile ones was also a remarkable observation. This type of observation supports the results of experiments on similar area performed by Pederson et al. (1988), Kimmons et al. (1990), and Kirkpatrick et al. (1990).\nThe results are of complete conclusion with Cook et al. (1991). The probable explanation of the deviation of the result could be drawn from observations of Kirkpatrick et al. (1990) that differences among endophytes isolates or in interactions between host genotype and fungal isolate are important. The occurrence of lower number of galls and females support the fact that endophytes resistance occurred early in the plant and nematode interaction. The probable explanation of this type of enhanced resistance like reduced invasion and increased emigration of juveniles or death of nematodes in the roots is due to the toxins produced by the endophytic fungus produced in the roots that repel or kill nematodes. This concept is also supported by the investigations of Siegel et al. (1989) that emphasized the production of toxins by the endophytic fungus and also the presence of endophytic fungus increased resistance.\n6 Fungal Endophytes: A Source for Biological Control Agents\n188\n6.5 Control of European Pepper Moth by Endophytes of Strawberry\nFragaria ananassa (Sc, name of the strawberry plant) is an economically important fruit plant worldwide and is affected by a large number of bacterial, fungal, viral, and nematodal pathogens. Such an example is the occurrence of nematodal pest Duponchelia fovealis Zeller, 1847, a member of Lepidoptera: Crambidae (the European pepper moth). Being native to marshy habitats of Southern Europe and eastern part of Mediterranean region this nematode is a green-house pest of flowers, fruits, and vegetables of aquatic and terrestrial plants found abundantly in Europe and Canada (CABI 2016) and recent reports include its invasion on strawberry plants (Bonsignore and Vacante 2009; Franco and Baptista 2010; Efil et al. 2014; Zawadneak et al. 2016). The popular control measures include chemical and physical controls with huge amount of side effects and natural enemies are also not effective against this nematode as this is considered to be an exotic species (Zawadneak et al. 2015). So focus is on endophytic fungus being the best suitable method in this respect. Endophyte isolated from strawberry plant is used as a biological control agent against the strawberry nematode pathogen (Amatuzzia et al. 2018).\nIn total 400 leaves of the strawberry cultivar “Albion” collected from four different commercial farms were placed into potato dextrose agar Petri-dishes after proper disinfection of the explants and maintained in incubation for 30 days with tetracycline supplemented media. Out of 517 fungal colonies some of them are identified as Alternaria sp., Aspergillus sp., Bipolaris sp., Cladosporium sp., Chaetomium sp., Diaporthe sp., Fusarium sp., Nigrospora sp., Paecilomyces sp., Penicillium sp., Phoma sp., Trichoderma sp., and Ulocladium sp. Eight isolates (belonging to genera Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Diaporthe, and Paecilomyces) were found to be effective against third instar larvae of Duponchelia fovealis. Isolates Paecilomyces sp. exhibited highest effectivity against the nematodal larvae."

      "text" : "Sirex noctilio also called as Sirex wood-wasp is a horntail species generally found as a native one to Asia, Europe, and northern parts of Africa. This wasp species is involved in a symbiotic relationship with a fungus Amylostereum areolatum that promotes the invasion of the wasp into the tree trunk by boring the trunk and the larvae are generally feed on the fungal hypha. Fungus also helps the invasion by secreting mucus like materials. Wang et al. in the year of 2019 selected nine species of Pinus in China; Pinus tabuliformis, Pinus sylvestris, var. mongolica, Pinus koraiensis, Picea koraiensis, Larix gmelinii, Pinus yunnanensis, Pinus massoniana, Pinus taeda, Pinus elliottii and evaluated the effect of endophyte diversity on the Sirex noctilio infection in terms of their oviposition behavior. They isolated a total number of 1626 endophytic fungi from 2025 explants (wooden blocks) of nine\nH. K. Santra and D. Banerjee\n189\nselected coniferous tree species and identified them by ITS (internal transcribed spacer) sequencing system. Each host plant is characterized by a unique structure of endophytic community and that varies from one host plant to another and from one region to another. The isolates belong to 61 species under 34 genera. Fifty-one out species (83.40%) were confirmed through molecular identification and ten species (16.60%) were identified by microscopic morphological characters. The isolates belong to the genera of Alternaria sp., Arthrinium sp., Ascocoryne sp., Aspergillus sp., Capronia sp., Chaetomium sp., Coprinopsis sp., Cylindrobasidium sp., Cytospora sp., Diaporthe sp., Fusarium sp., Gliocladium sp., Gliomastix sp., Lasiodiplodia sp., Mucor sp., Ophiostoma sp., Paecilomyces sp., Paraconiothyrium sp., Penicillium sp., Pestalotiopsis sp., Peyronellaea sp., Phaeomollisia sp., Phoma sp., Phomopsis sp., Pythium sp., Schizophyllum sp., Seiridium sp., Sphaeropsis sp., Sydowia sp., Trichoderma sp., and Umbelopsis sp. CR (colonization rate) and IR (isolation rate) of endophytes from Pinus tabuliformis were the lowest and were the highest for Pinus elliottii. CR and IR values for other species were of no such significant deviation. The endophytic community also varied from different portions of the same species like base portion, central part, and also upper portions of the trunk of the Pine tree. The chances of getting infected by this wasp is negatively proportionate to the diversity of the endophytic fungus in Pinus plant as the higher occurrence of infection is due to the poor diversity of endophytic fungus in the host plant. Results are indicative that out of the nine tested coniferous plant the highest chances of getting infected by wasp is in case of Pinus tabuliformis and lowest in case of Pinus elliottii and intermediate in case of others due to the lower occurrence of endophytic species in case of P. tabuliformis.\n6.7 Endophytic Fungal Isolates Against Cotton Leaf Worm (Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.)\nSaad et  al. (2019) isolated ten endophytic fungus from four angiospermic plants (two were medicinal plants and two were weeds); Pelargonium graveolens (Geraniaceae), Melia azedarach (Meliaceae), Chenopodium album (Chenopodiaceae), and Malva parviflora (Malvaceae). The isolates of C. album were identified as Fusarium chlamydosporum saad3 MG786540, Alternaria alternata saad5 MG786542, Alternaria alternata saad8 MG786545, Fusarium oxysporum saad4 MG786541, Phoma sp.

Two popular\n6 Fungal Endophytes: A Source for Biological Control Agents\n190\ntechniques were used for this assay that includes either dipping in spore suspension or residual film technique.\nThe endophytes were screened having their insecticidal capacity by calculating the mortality rates of the larvae. In residual film technique no such endophytic fungus yielded positive results. Secondary metabolites were subjected to isolation from the endophytic isolates in order to evaluate their insecticidal property using ethyl acetate as a standard organic solvent for the effective extraction. Dipping assay revealed the insecticidal property of the isolates named C. lunata, followed by A. solani and A. alternata, respectively, with a mortality percentage of 60% as highest among all the tested ones, 40% and 33.3%.

They actually tested the efficiency of the fungus to modify the host plant in terms of volatile compounds production with insecticidal activity. Beauveria bassiana (Hypocreales), an entomopathogenic fungus is a common parasite of insects and is distributed worldwide. They isolated B. bassiana from soil sample of grape vineyard and inoculated the fungus (1 × 108 conidia mL−1) on grape vine (Vitis vinifera) and again re-isolated the fungal species from the grape plant leaves after 25 days from the first inoculation. The effect of inoculation has led to production of unique volatile compounds with insecticidal compounds like benzaldehyde (Paulraj et al. 2011), limonene (Hebeish et al. 2008), geraniol (Chen and Viljoen 2010), geranylacetone (Maia and Moore 2011), gamma-terpinene (Wang et al. 2006), beta-Pinene (Dambolena et al. 2016), napthelene (Daisy et al. 2002), M-Cymene (Chang et al. 2002), Citral, naphthalene, 2-hexanoic acid, terpinolene, benzene, benzofuranone, heptadecane, nerolidol, pentanoic acid. The occurrences of these insecticidal compounds increase the plants’ resistance by reducing the number of female nematodes and their infestation activity. The re-isolation confirms the endophytic nature of the phytophagous fungus and inoculation is done before the artificial inoculation of Planococcus ficus on Vitis vinifera. Though plant growth parameters were not (N, P, K, Na, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, B contents of leaf) sharply deviating from the fungus treated and untreated Vitis plant but there was a change in (calcium) Ca and (magnesium) Mg content of the plant leaf tissues. This type of study elaborates the fact that endophytic fungi are effective against insects of economically important plants also, thus, enhancing the plants’ protection.\nH. K. Santra and D. Banerjee\n191\n6.9 Biocontrol of Radopholus similis (Root Burrowing Nematode) by Banana Endophytes\nRadopholus similis also known as the burrowing nematode is a devastating pathogen of banana (Musa paradisiaca) and has led to qualitative and quantitative decrease of the yield. It is an agent of root rot causing reddish brown lesions in the cortical portions of the root and hampering the water conduction, nutrient uptake leading to the lengthy vegetative cycle and finally to the death of the plant (Gowen and Quénéhérvé 1990). Chemical control measures being too much expensive and non-eco-friendly lead to hazardous problems of human health. Till date a very few reports include development of complete resistant banana species against the banana plant (Gowen 1995). Scientist has moved to biological methods for this reason (Kerry 1990 and Sikora 1992). Endophytes could be an alternative solution in this respect (Hallmann and Sikora 1994; Schuster et al. 1995). Some fungal species are reported to be anti-endoparasitic (Sikora 1992; Schuster et  al. 1995). Previously endophytic fungus isolated from banana root tissue has been checked for the antinematodal activity in vitro by culture filtrate assay (Schuster et al. 1995).\nNiere et al. (1999) investigated the in vivo and in vitro effectivity of the Fusarium oxysporum isolates (from banana root) against burrowing nematode and also their influence on plant growth. They prepared PDB (potato dextrose broth) culture extracts with spore suspensions (1.4–3.2 × 106 spores/ml) of 4 selected isolates V4w5, III3w3, III4w1, and V5w2 and inoculated them on the previously tested (in vitro) banana seedling (Musa AAA, cv. Gros Michel) raised through tissue culture techniques (Vuylsteke 1989). The plantlets were potted in 100 ml cups with sterilized soil filled in it and after 4 weeks transferred to carry bags containing 2  l of sterilized soil. Two set of experiments were carried out just having the difference between the time (one setup of 13 weeks aged and another of 32 weeks aged). Plants were removed from the polythene bags and after gentle wash of the roots they were inoculated with 10 Radopholus similis females singly collected from soil populations and kept directly on the root surface. Then they are infected with fungal endophytes for the observation of their morphological changes at 4  weeks constant interval. Beginning 6 weeks after nematode inoculation (plant age 19 and 38 weeks, respectively), the root segments inoculated with the nematode in the cup were cut free from the intact root and the nematodes extracted overnight by the extraction dish method (Oostenbrink 1960). All nematodes extracted were concentrated on a 20 μm sieve and counted.\nEndophyte treated plants are reported to be enhanced in their growth parameters by 11–25%. After the complete removal of soil, transplantation of the plant and nematodal infection Fo1 is known to be promoting plant height by 29% in relation to the control plant. The nematode multiplication rate is reduced in plants treated with endophytic isolates. The reduction rate varied but Fo4 is proved to be the potent one regarding the reduction in number (26% than the control, i.e., untreated plant) of nematode population in a 19-weeks-old root segment whereas the nematode population increased up to 33% (in comparison to the initial number of nematode) in a\n6 Fungal Endophytes: A Source for Biological Control Agents\n192\n38-week-old control (without any endophyte inoculation) plant.

It is one of the giant causes of worldwide severe economic loss in pome fruit marketing. Chemical fumigants like methyl bromide are restricted due to quarantine issues in case of international import and export. So there is an urgent need for the discovery of effective moth inhibiting agents with minimum amount of side effects. In this regard endophytic fungus from medicinal plant has been an effective alternative. Such a remarkable work had been done by Lacey and his co-workers in the year of 2009. They collected the endophytic Muscodor albus Worapong, Strobel, and Hess (A member of Ascomycota; family—Xylariaceae) and evaluated the bioactivity of the volatile compounds emitted by the endophytic isolates against the growth and development of the different stages (codling moth adults, diapausing cocooned larvae, larvae in infested apple, neonate larvae) of codling moth.\nThe fumigation of the adult moths with M. albus VOCs for a continuous exposure of 72 h and immediate incubation in fresh open air for 24 h time at a temperature of 25 °C leads to 81% mortality of the total larvae. When the time of treatment or exposure is enhanced to 48 h or 120 h the mortality increased from 84% to 100%. The control apple fruits were also found to be with dead moths due to their short life span. Treatment of neonate larvae for 72 h on apple fruits and then immediate incubation for 7  days resulted in 86% of mortality. The larvae were mostly of third instars stage and when apples infested (for 5 days) with moth larvae exposed to volatiles for 3 continuous days 71% mortality occurred. Not only that the diapausing cocooned moth larvae when exposed to volatile organic compounds for one or 2 weeks resulted in 31% to 100% of mortality. So this type of biocontrol ability of endophytic M. albus opens up new popular angles of environment friendly techniques for the broad spectrum protection of economically important plants like apple from pest devastation."

One such pathogen is PTM (potato tuber moth) scientifically named as Phthorimaea operculella (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) found all over the world as a serious pest of potato tubers on field and in storage conditions in the countries especially where potato tubers are grown. Biological control of this serious pest has been performed by the unique volatiles of the novel endophytic fungus Muscodor albus (Lacey and Neven 2006). The volatile antimicrobial includes alcohols, esters, ketones, acids, and lipids and shows insecticidal activity. They exposed adult and neonate larvae to the VOCs generated by M. albus sterile mycelium (15 g or 30 g) for 72 h at 24 °C in a sealed 28.3 L chambers. When the mycelial weight of M. albus is increased from 0 to 15 g and finally to 30 g as a source of volatile exposure the mortality increased from 84.6% to 90.6%, respectively. When the pupal stages were exposed to 15 g and 30 g of M. albus culture their growth reduced by 61.8% and 72.8% in relation to control conditions.\nThe time of exposure is also a valuable parameter for the control of PTM. Though the higher exposure leads to the accumulation of excess CO2 generated by the respiration of the endophytic fungus M. albus which is harmful for tuber storage but still exposure for 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days and incubation at 27 °C leads to the increased mortality of 84.2%, 95.5%, and 99.6%, respectively. Increased exposure significantly affected on mortality of larvae; determined in terms of percentage as larvae fail to survive to the adult stage. Temperature for incubation has a direct effect on larval death and studies are indicative that lower temperature leads to reduced mortality, so this type of biological control measure is effective in warm and humid countries where potato tubers grow generally at 25–35 °C. When the temperature are fluctuated from 10 °C to 15 °C and finally to 24 °C with an exposure of 7 days followed by clean air incubation at 27 °C the mortality rates are 50.8%, 76.8%, and 95.4%, respectively (Lacey et al. 2008). Storage conditions and degree of cooling are also valuable factors for using this biocontrol method. So this study clearly states the fact that if some correction could be made like the excess CO2 production M. albus volatiles could be an effective tool in this respect. Proper detection of volatiles in GC-MS and preparation of artificial mixtures of those chemicals could replace the harmful side effects of other measures of pest control.\n6.12 Entomopathogenic Fungi Affecting Aphis gossypii Infections on Melon Plants (Cucumis melo var. cantalupensis)\nAphid control has been a grave problem for the farmers and agriculturalists as they not only involve direct damage of crops but also are effective agents of transmission of economically important plant virus (Van Emden and Harrington 2007). Aphids are characterized with high fecundity rates and short lifetimes as a result they grow rapidly (Dixon 1998). Chemical control leads to development of resistance.\n6 Fungal Endophytes: A Source for Biological Control Agents\n194\nEntopathogenic fungi here play a vital role for biological control measure (Brodeur et  al. 2018). A high percentage of fungus that infects aphids belongs to Entomopthoromycota and Ascomycota (Order Hypocreales) and the Ascomycota members are highly commercialized due to their fast mass production in vitro and easy spray formulation (Burges 1998). The myco-insecticides are environmentally safe and meet the guidelines of legislation requirements (Lacey et al. 2005). They are not only used in spraying, drenching, and seed dressing but also as endophyte for protecting the plant (Quesada-Moraga et  al. 2009; Sánchez-Rodríguez et  al. 2018). Using entomopathogenic fungi as a tool for the biological control of aphids is one of the possible measures of plant protection especially in green house conditions.\nGonzález-Mas et al. (2019) study on the behavior of entomopathogenic fungi as an endophyte of those treated plant and evaluated the enhancement of resistance against the aphid attack. Generally Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium brunneum acts as common entomopathogens of serious pest like aphid; Aphis gossypii and protect the economically important vegetable crops that are largely affected worldwide regarding their quality and quantity of production due to this type of pathogenic aphid attack. They studied that when the entomopathogen is sprayed on the leaves of the host melon plant (Cucumis melo var. cantalupensis; FamilyCucurbitaceae) they acted as endophyte and infected the host plants leaf tissues. This statement was confirmed by the successful isolation (100% for infected leaves and 20–40% for non-sprayed leaves) of that fungus again from leaf tissues as an endophytic one. These herbivores’ life table parameters and behavior are drastically affected by the endophytic nature of this fungus. Investigations were made on lethal and pre-mortality rates of those two entomopathogens on the cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii). The effect of endophyte on the mortality rates were determined either by feeding the aphid population on endophyte colonized leaves or on endophytic fungus sprayed leaves. The comparison were made by feeding the larvae on un-colonized leaves. Mortality rates of this Hemiptera aphid were found to be between the values of 37.70–50.00% in case of endophyte colonized leaves and in comparison to fungus sprayed leaves where the values ranged between 48.2% and 56.9%.\nThe nymph productions were also affected by endophytic colonization. Though endophytic colonization had no drastic effect on aphid control but plants are benefitted by indirect methods like defense enhancement, resistance development to plant pathogens, and also abiotic stress tolerance. Endophytic colonization on plants largely affects the volatile emissions of those plant tissues in contrast to the controlled or untreated plants. The VOCs were recorded using GC-MS and by comparing with standards. The volatiles emitted by the crushed homogenized melon plant tissues fall under several chemical classes like aldehyde, alcohols, ketones. The major aldehydes are 2-pentenal, 2-heptenal, 2-octenal, 2-nonenal, 2-hexenal, 2,4-hexadienal, 2,4-heptadienal, 2,6-nonadienal, 3-methyl-hexanal, 3-methylbutanal, 4-heptenal, 4-oxohex-2-enal, 5-methyl-hexanal, 6-nonenal, butanal, hexanal, heptanal, nonanal, octanal, pentanal. The predominant alcohols include ethanol, 1-octen-3-ol, 1-penten-3-ol, 2-hexen-1-ol, 2-propyl-1-pentanol,\nH. K. Santra and D. Banerjee\n195\n2-ethyl- 1-hexanol, 3-hexen-1-ol, 4-methyl-1-pentanol. The keton bodies are 6-methyl-2-heptanone, 3-octanone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, 3,5-octadien-2-one. Chemical compounds like 2,2,6-trimethyl-cyclohexanone, β-cyclocitral, β-citral, β-ionone, eucarvone, geranial, isomethyl-α-ionone were also recorded.\nPhenolic derivatives include 2-phenyl-isopranol, acetophenone, benzaldehyde, benzophenone, benzyl alcohol, phenol, toluene. In spite of such huge production of different types of volatiles by the endophyte infected leaf tissues the host selection of aphid population (confirmed by choice based assays) has not been affected by the blend of volatiles emitted. This type of biological control is environment friendly and does not develop resistance, so should be adopted in large scale and is one of the unique applications of endophyte as biological control agent."

The endophytes were identified as species of Phyllosticta capitalensis and Phyllosticta paracapitalensis. These endophytes are tested for their in vitro antifungal activity against citrus black spot pathogen Phyllosticta citricarpa. For the first time these species are reported from Australia (Queensland) and proved through the principles of Koch’s postulate that these endophytic isolates are non-pathogenic to the host citrus species, thus could be confirmed as a true endophyte of citrus and providing protection against one of the dreadful diseases of these economically important plants. In vivo test also shows reduction of P. citricarpa pathogen on citrus fruits after inoculation of endophytic isolate P. capitalensis 14 days before the pathogen inoculation.

Yuan et al. (2017) isolated four endophytic fungi (CEF-818 (Penicillium simplicissimum), CEF-714 (Leptosphaeria sp.), CEF-642 (Talaromyces flavus.), and CEF-193 (Acremonium sp.) from different portions of the cotton plant collected from Anyang region of Henan province of China. The phytopathogen was isolated from infected soils of Xinji of Hebei province of China. They used two upland cotton cultivars named Gossypium hirsutum Jimian 11 and Lumianyan 21 which were susceptible and tolerant to the disease, respectively.\nThe isolates were tested for their disease control activity in vivo in green house condition where the tested plants were maintained and results indicated the control efficacy of the isolates ranged from 26% (Talaromyces flavus) to 67% (Penicillium simplicissimum) after a treatment of 25 days from the time of inoculation. In comparison to the controls of the disease nursery the isolates showed a better level of protection efficiency of 69.5%, 69.2%, 54.6%, and 45.7% by Penicillium simplicissimum, Acremonium sp., and Leptosphaeria sp., Talaromyces flavus, respectively. Reports include that endophytic isolates CEF-818 and CEF-714 offer protection to the host plant even in the heavily infected cases (during the time of early July; the first peak of the disease). These types of result are indicative that endophytic isolates not only delayed the wilt symptoms but they reduced the symptoms on the host plants.\nThe treatment with endophyte causes the enhancement of harvest up to 13.1 and 12.2% increase from the untreated ones. When the seeds are treated with the isolates the production increased (7.3%) from 3207.51 kg/ha to 3442.04 kg/ha. Study up to molecular details included that treatment of endophytes increased the transcript level of PAL (phenylalanine ammonia lyase), PPO (polyphenol oxidase), and POD (peroxidase) that results in the increase of defense reactions in the cotton plant. So the summary of the performed experiment is that the endophytic treatment in vitro conditions improved the yield of cotton seed in cotton fields and also results in the enhancement of the disease resistance ability of this plant. So it will be a great chance of biological control against the verticillium wilt of cotton.\n6.13.3 Biocontrol of Moniliophthora spp. by Endophytes of Theobroma cacao (Malvaceae)\nTheobroma cacao, a plant of Malvaceae family is commonly known as the cocoa tree and the seeds are commercially exploited in chocolate industry for making of chocolate liquor, cocoa solids, and cocoa butter. The economically important taxon is affected largely by frosty pod rot and witches’ broom diseases caused by the aggressive fungal pathogens Moniliophthora roreri and Moniliophthora perniciosa, respectively. M. roreri affects the development of fruits leading to severe yield loss up to 30–100% (Bowers et al. 2001; Sánchez et al. 2015) and M. perniciosa affects the leaves, branches, shoots, flowers (Parra and Sánchez 2005). Villavicenciovásquez and his co-workers in the year of 2018 tried the biological control methods\nH. K. Santra and D. Banerjee\n197\nfor the reduction of these dreadful fungal pathogenic attacks using endophytic fungal flora of the host plant (T. cacao) itself as a tool. They isolated 17 fungal strains from leaves of T. cacao collected from two different parts of Ecuador; Balao and Naranjal of Guayas province and Molleturo of Azuay province. Out of 17 endophytic fungal isolates seven were identified as Lasiodiplodia theobromae, three isolates are known as Pestalotiopsis microspora, two proved to be Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, others are identified as Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Xylaria feejeensis, Daldinia eschscholtzii, Xylaria sp., Hypoxylon investiens, and Nigrospora sphaerica. The biocontrol ability of these isolates were determined by two ways; by detecting the mycoparasitism of foliar endophytic fungus against Moniliophthora spp., antifungal activity by the crude extracts containing secondary metabolites. The true endophytic nature was confirmed by the re-inoculation test.\nThree strains of L. theobromae (Ec098, Ec151, Ec157) were found to effective antifungal agent in both the cases of direct antagonism and crude extract tests. They were successfully recolonized onto the host plant for almost 80–100%. The strains of L. theobromae were all square in all the three formats whereas other isolates were magnificent in only one parameter each like Ec035 (identified as L. theobromae) is an effective agent for mycoparasitism against both of the indicator organism when both the colonies were brought into contact but is the second best in antifungal activity shown by the crude extracts and moreover they were unable to re-infect host plant. Another strain of endophytic fungus Ec059 identified as Xylaria feejeensis has the 100% of re-inoculation but is negative in antagonistic tests. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Ec107) inhibited Moniliophthora roreri but also stimulated the growth of another phytopathogen Moniliophthora perniciosa. So the fungal endophytes of T. cacao could be largely exploited as biological control agent. Alternative biological control of the above said two pathogens were already done by antagonistic native microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi (Hebbar 2007; Bailey et al., 2008; Hernández-Rodríguez et al. 2014). This study focuses on the ability of the endophyte on the above said purpose as they help the plant to defend against pathogenic attack (Arnold et al. 2003). Previously scientists have tried integrated management system with the use of biological agent like Trichoderma spp., chemicals like azoxystrobin, chlorothalonil, cupric oxide, copper sulfate and also physical techniques like pruning and removal of diseased fruits. But endophytes were not explored widely for this purpose."

Previous techniques include the control through chemical fungicide or by physical separation of affected individuals. But nowaday focus has been totally shifted to the alternative mode of biological control measures maintaining the sustainability of the environment. The use of mycoparasites or antagonists leading to interhyphal physical interference using the volatile or non-volatile secondary metabolites has already been studied in large scale (Benítez et al. 2004). Verticillium biguttatum (an obligate mycoparasite) and Trichoderma sp. have been used as biological control agent of R. solani (Van Den Boogert & Jager). Earlier researchers have confirmed the anti-Rhizoctonia activity of Ampelomyces, Coniothyrium, and Trichoderma (Berg 2009). Lahlali and Hijri (2010) isolated six fungal endophytes from Acer platanoides (Family Sapindaceae), commonly called as Norway maple and identified them (by microscopic morphology and ITS rDNA sequences) as Trichoderma atroviride, Epicoccum nigrum (E1, E8, E18), Alternaria longipes (E13), and Phomopsis sp. (R24).\nThey evaluated the antifungal activity of the isolates against the potato tuber pathogen Rhizoctonia solani in vitro and in green house conditions by direct confrontation methods. It has been found that endophytic fungal isolate T. atroviride and E. nigrum inhibited the pathogenic fungus in vitro in dual culture assays having the highest zone of inhibition of mycelial growth among the tested individuals. Evaluation of antifungal ability includes the screening by secondary metabolites production. The highest inhibition zone was displayed by the culture filtrates of T. atroviride. The inhibitory effect of the fungal isolates was further studied in detail using confocal microscopy that confirmed that Trichoderma atroviride acts as mycoparasite and competitor. Epicoccum nigrum covers the mycelium of R. solani and causes the lysis of cell wall leading to loss of turgidity of the cells of the pathogen. The fungal hyphae of Trichoderma atroviride rolls up and penetrates into the mycelium of tuber pathogen leading to the formation of dense coils tightly encircling the fungal hyphae.\nPhomopsis sp. invades the pathogen colony and competes for nutrients finally limiting its growth and the fungal hyphal densities are found to be higher than R. solani. Though hyphae of A. longipes were of more density than R. solani and hyphae of the pathogen were of abnormal morphology in comparison to the control or untreated one but endophytic Alternaria shows no hyphal penetration or inhibition of the pathogen. So it could be drawn that Phomopsis sp. causes loss of turgor. The fungal isolates were recorded for the antifungal volatile emissions in split plate method and the remarkable antagonistic properties are shown by T. atrovirde, Phomopsis sp., A. longipes, E. nigrum E18, E1, and E8 with an inhibition percentage of 81.81, 38.63, 21.02, 20.73, 11.36, and 10.22, respectively. In vivo tests performed in green house conditions confirmed the endophytic fungal isolates T. atroviride and E. nigrum enhanced the yield of potato tuber and significantly reduced the stem disease caused by the pathogens. So this endophytic genus could be used in large-scale as a biocontrol agent of stem and tuber pathogens.\nH. K. Santra and D. Banerjee\n199"

Chemical fungicides are found to be ineffective due to development of resistance. In this occasion biological control is the best effective way. Atugala and Deshappriya (2015) for the first time isolated 41 fungal endophytes from 160 explants of leaves, stems, seeds, roots of two rice plant varieties Suwandel (35 endophytic fungal isolates from 80 explants) and Kaluheenati (31 endophytic fungal isolates from 80 explants) grown in Sri Lanka. The isolates were identified as Cylindrocladium sp., Absidia sp., Aspergillus sp.1, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium sp., Paecilomyces sp., Phoma sp., Gliocladium sp., Acremonium sp., Aspergillus sp. 2, Rhizoctonia sp., Aspergillus sp. 3, Varicosporium sp., Rhizopus sp., Arthroderma sp., Aureobasidium sp. Most of the fungal endophytes belonged to Ascomycetes group and only one genus fall under Basidiomycetes and two under Zygomycetes. Absidia sp. and Cylindrospermum sp. were the dominant fungi found in Suwandel and Kaluheenati, respectively.\nThey selected the two most commonly occurring endophyte and tested their effect on crop plants’ growth and also antagonistic or antifungal ability against the pathogen. Results include that the treated plants show remarkable enhancement of plant height and plant weight (dry weight and fresh weight). They screened 22 endophytic isolates with antifungal activity checked in dual culture assay. The potent isolates inhibited the pathogenic fungal growth (M. grisea) by coiling their hyphae around pathogenic fungal hyphae and forming loops and clamps. Absidia sp. and Acremonium sp. were the best agents for growth inhibition of the pathogenic one by their inhibitory structures. Thirteen endophytic fungi were cultured in broth medium and were checked for the presence of antifungal secondary metabolites by diffusion plate method. In vivo studies were performed with three endophytic fungi (Acremonium sp., Absidia sp., Penicillium sp.) against M. grisea. A set of plant was kept separate and designated as control and other three sets were inoculated by the endophytic fungus first then by pathogenic fungus. The control plant only received the spore suspension as inoculum of the pathogen in an amount of 1 × 107 spores/ mL. Plants pre-inoculated with endophytic fungi and next infected with pathogen show no disease symptoms. Only endophytic Penicillium sp. treated plants showed the occurrence of disease symptoms. So, endophytic Absidia sp., Acremonium sp. could be used commercially in field trials for the protection of rice plants from pathogenic fungal attack.\n6 Fungal Endophytes: A Source for Biological Control Agents\n200"

      "text" : "Indonesia represents the third highest producers of Cacao (ICCO Annual Report 2014/2015). Sulawesi Island of this Southeast Asian country is the prime producer and is reported to be largely affected by the systemic VSD (vascular streak disease). This vascular streak disease leads to the loss of almost 774 million US dollar (Abdurrahman (2017)). The causal agent is named as Ceratobasidium theobromae (earlier known as Oncobasidium theobromae), belongs to the basidiomycete (Guest and Keane 2007; Samuels et al. 2012). It not only hampers the cacao production but also questions its existence in the affected areas especially in small-scale farms. Wind-borne spores matures during midnight to early morning time, penetrate the unhardened leaves at terminal portions of the branch, and grow through the cuticular portions just above the veins of the leaves finally infecting the xylem and stem tissues after 3 or 5 months of first penetration through ramification of the hypha (Prior 1979). Being a systemic disease the control measures are tough including the application of fungitoxic triadimefon, triazole, triadimenol, and propiconazole that protect the leaves from the germination of the basidiospores on it.\nChemical methods are avoided due to their high cost and cultural or biological control measures are focused in this respect. Asman et al. (2018) isolated ten fungal endophytes from the healthy branch of vascular streak disease resistance cacao plants. The fungal identification was done by comparing the colony characters with standard literature and identified as Aspergillus-like colony, Curvularia-like colony, Colletotrichum-like colony, Fusarium-like colony, Gliocladium-like colony, Geotrichum-like colony, another four isolates due to the absence of their reproductive structures are known as mycelia sterilia 1–4. The fungal isolates were infected to a 2.5-months-old cacao seedling and after 30 days the fungal pathogen was inoculated and the seedlings were placed in a region surrounded by the cacao infected plants for the facilitation of the secondary infection. They started recording the disease incidence after 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, and 120 days of disease incidence. The results proved that endophytic fungi when pre-inoculated to the cacao plants can reduce infection occurrence but vary from days (60, 90, 120  days) after detection.\nThe incidence occurrence were reduced after 60 days when the treatment was done by Curvularia-like colony, followed by Geotrichum-like colony, Fusariumlike colony, mycelia sterilia isolate 4 and the results were better than the standard antifungal antibiotic copper fungicide. After 90 days still Curvularia-like colony was found to be best effective followed by mycelia sterilia isolate 1 which was equal or better than the copper fungicide treatment. Final tests were again done using the 120-days-old plants and the results include Curvularia-like colony showed higher degree of resistance even higher than the standard copper fungicide followed by sterile mycelia (isolate no. 1), colony resembling Gliocladium, colony similar with Fusarium-, Geotrichum-like colony, sterile mycelia 3, Colletotrichum-like colony, Aspergillus-like colony and lastly control (no application), sterile mycelia 2, sterile mycelia 4 with percentage of 3.0, 8.3, 9.5, 11.3, 15.8, 18.0, 19.0, 19.3, 21.3, 26.5,\nH.

The re-isolation of the endophytes from the infected plants was made and it was found that after 150 days no endophyte was potentially re-isolated from root, stem, or leaf but after 30 days all the endophytic isolates were found to be reappeared from leaf tissues but not from the root or stem tissues except Colletotrichum-like colony morphology showing endophyte. This type of experimental result can conclude that endophytes could be used for biological control of dreadful fungal diseases."

A group consisting of 22 fungal isolates was found to very effective in the control (30–51% inhibition) of F. graminearum and these strains were known to be effective controller (15–53% inhibition) of F. culmorum also globally. New findings of this study include the identification of three previously unknown species with anti-Fusarium head blight activity. They confirmed Phoma glomerata, Aureobasidium proteae, and Sarocladium kiliense to be antifungal by screening on a detached spikelet inflorescence of the wheat plant. This was the first report from wheat endophyte that these three species are effective biocontrol agent of the dreadful pathogen Fusarium culmorum and F. graminearum. Authors pointed out a significant difference among the antifungal ability of the endophytic fungal isolates in the two different types of in  vitro screening approaches applied in this study. Findings emphasizes on the procedure that includes the use of detached wheat spikelet which potentially points out the pathogenicity of the endophyte and also growth ability of the endophytic isolate on the targeted host plant.

Abdallah et al. (2018) isolated five endophytic fungi; four from soil sample and one from maize stubble. They were\n6 Fungal Endophytes: A Source for Biological Control Agents\n202\nidentified as Clonostachys rosea, Sordaria fimicola, and Epicoccum nigrum (three species) according to their macroscopic and microscopic morphology along with their nucleotide sequencing. Sordaria fimicola is found to be a potent inhibitor of the pathogenic fungal growth in vitro tested by dual culture assay for 4 days in a sharp comparison with other well-known biocontrol agent like Trichoderma harzianum. Other isolates Clonostachys rosea and Epicoccum nigrum showed similar antifungal activity whereas the control Piriformospora sp. was not efficient in this respect. The absolute mycotoxin levels were variable in PDA plates of different endophytic genus and between different strains of the same endophytic species especially for reduction in deoxynivalenol (DON) and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON) production. Sordaria fimicola and one isolate of E. nigrum could decrease the DON levels in comparison to the reference strains of biological control agents. Though the results were of high variation after repeated replication Clonostachys rosea was average in mycotoxin reduction. Endophytic Sordaria fimicola UG 106, Epicoccum nigrum UG 1703 reduced completely the ZEN (Zearalenone) production. These isolates were consistent in their reduction ability against ZEN production. It is concluded from the above mycotoxin reduction studies that DON and 15-ADON levels are related to reduction of fungal hyphal growth. The more the fungal growth is reduced more the mycotoxin levels are reduced. In case of ZEN synthesis the hyphal growth in one way and in another way the mycotoxins are inhibited by the endophytes directly. The volatiles of Sordaria fimicola reduced the fungal growth up to 60–70% in comparison to the control. In vivo tests revealed the reduction of DON levels in maize plant after endophytic treatment. Except E. nigrum UG 11703 the other endophytic isolates Sordaria fimicola, E. nigrum UG 11701, E. nigrum 11702, and Clonostachys rosea cause significant reduction in 15-ADON levels.

Phyllogenetic analysis revealed that endophytic isolates belonged to group of Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Zygomycota with a percentage of 81.7%, 7.08%, 10%, respectively. Fifty-nine genera were found to be unknown.

The endophytic diversity was determined using Shannon diversity index that revealed that root tissues are colonized by endophytic fungal isolates more than stem or leaf tissues. The cause might be due to the rhizospheric nature of the soil. Diversity of the endophytic fungus are totally dependent on geographical locations and the environmental factors of that particular area in reference to its temperature, rainfall, humidity, and soil type or other physical or abiotic factors. Some fungal isolates are found to be tissue specific extremely.

So this endophytic A22F1 could be exploited commercially for root rot pathogen control of Bell pepper.\n6.13.12 Mycofumigation by M. albus Reduces Verticillium Wilt of Egg-Plant\nVolatiles from endophytic fungus are a promising source of new and novel bioactive compounds for agricultural exploitation in terms of their antifungal activity and biocontrol ability. A very potent genus Muscodor plays an important role in this respect and is commercially exploited worldwide for their broad spectrum antipathogenic activity that has open up new areas of agricultural research on microbial volatiles. Muscodor species has been isolated as a true endophyte worldwide by several workers from different type of plants residing in diverse environments and they have checked for their biocontrol (mycofumigating) ability in vitro (Table 6.1). Usually the identity of the genus is confirmed by molecular means, also supporting evidences are collected from their channel tests and specialized microscopic structure unique for this genus. One such application is documented here. Mycofumigation with the two agents; Muscodor albus and M. roseus has effectively enhanced the Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) stand establishment and reduced the disease severity\nH. K. Santra and D. Banerjee\n205\n6 Fungal Endophytes: A Source for Biological Control Agents\n206\nH. K. Santra and D. Banerjee\n207\nwhen these two mycofumigating agents are applied in autoclaved sterilized soil prior infested with severe pathogens like Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium ultimum, Aphanomyces cochlioides (Stinson et al. 2003). Experiment with egg-plant seedlings include the mycofumigation of the autoclaved soil previously inoculated with pathogens that significantly reduces the disease incidence on Solanum melongena\n6 Fungal Endophytes: A Source for Biological Control Agents\n208\nafter 4–5  weeks when compared with non-fumigated but Verticillium pathogen infested soil. Damping off disease (caused by Pythium ultimum) is controlled effectively by Muscodor roseus volatiles but in case of sugar beet pathogen Fusarium sp. (Causal agent of Fusarium wilt of sugar beet) mycofumigation was not effective. The common formulations include potato dextrose agar strips with fungal mycelium, alginate capsules having hyphae, barley grains infected with M. roseus or M. albus, stabilize or Pesta granules with fungal inoculum. The best control of Aphanomyces cochliodes (causal agent of damping off) was obtained by Stabileze formulation and Rhizoctonia solani damping off was minimized by agar strip method coupled with barley grain inoculation technique. None of the fungal volatiles affected the plant growth or external morphological appearance. So it could be said that mycofumigation using M. albus and M. roseus is a new way for control of soil-borne pathogens P. ultimum, A. cochlioides, R. solani, and V. dahliae.\n6.13.13 M. albus Controlling the Post-Harvest Decay\nMercier and Jiménez (2004) worked on the ability of the fungal volatiles of M. albus for the control of decay on economically important fruits apple and peach. They assessed the mycofumigating property of the Muscodor albus in vitro and in vivo. In vitro tests resulted in death of a wide range of storage pathogens like Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum acutatum, Geotrichum candidum, Monilinia fructicola, Penicillium digitatum, and Rhizopus sp. In vivo tests include the treatment of apples for 7 days with the culture of M. albus and resulted in complete inhibition of blue and gray mold growth (P. expansum and B. cinerea, respectively). The fruits were inoculated with pathogen and M. albus culture is not in direct contact with the fruit but exposed to its volatiles. In case of wound inoculated peach fruits 24–72 h of fumigation controlled the brown rot disease (Monilinia fructicola). Shorter fumigation time also resulted in complete control of mold and gray mold. Headspace GC-FID detection showed the maximum occurrence of 2-methyl-1-butanol, isobutyric acid.\n6.13.14 Volatiles of Endophytic Daldinia cf concentrica Control Aspergillus niger\nOther than Muscodor species a lots of endophytes have been isolated those are efficient producers of volatile bioactive compounds with antifungal activity (Table 6.2). One of such example includes the biocontrol of Aspergillus niger and other food pathogens or agricultural pathogens (Alternaria alternata pathotype tangelo, Alternaria alternate, Aspergillus niger, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum sp., Coniella sp., Fusarium euwallaceae, Fusarium mangiferae, Fusarium oxysporum,\nH.

In total 27 volatiles (3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 1-methyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene, 4-heptanone, isoamyl acetate, 4-heptyn-2-ol, 2-octenal, octanal, 4,4-dimethyl1,3-cyclopentanedione, 2, 2, 5-trimethylcyclopentanone, phenyl ethyl alcohol, β-elemene,-α-funebrene, α-guaiene, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanol, terpenes, β-selinene, α-selinene, α-bulnesene, germacrene,α-selinene, veratryl acetone, 3-methoxy-2-naphthol, pogostol) have been identified from its unique mixture of volatiles that have immense importance in food processing and storage industry as they are proved to be inhibiting the growth of the one of the common food pathogen or contaminant Aspergillus niger.\nH.

Mycotoxins are a group of secondary metabolites characterized by both a diversity of chemical structures and biological activities. Mycotoxigenic species can be found in all major taxonomic groups of fungi, but the genus Aspergillus is undoubtedly one of the most important (Abarca et al. 2001; Rana et al. 2019b; Yadav et al. 2017). The Aspergillus species that produce mycotoxins are more common in the warmer, subtropical, and tropical areas than in the temperate areas of the world (Wilson et al. 2002). Some of the Aspergillus species and teleomorphs that potentially produce mycotoxins include A. candidus, A. clavatus, A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. niger, A. nomius, A. ochraceus, A. parasiticus, A. restrictus, A. tamarii, A. terreus, A. versicolor, Emericella nidulans, and Eurotium amstelodami (Wilson et al. 2002; Rana et al. 2019a; Yadav et al. 2020a).\nThe term mycotoxin was first used in the 1960s to describe the toxin associated with contaminated peanuts in animal feed and the loss of turkeys in England (Turkey X disease). This mycotoxin was later identified as the Aspergillus flavus toxin (aflatoxin B1) (Ismaiel and Papenbrock 2015). Mycotoxins are defined as natural products produced by fungi that evoke a toxic response when introduced in low concentration to higher vertebrates and other animals by natural route (Alshannaq and Yu 2017(. Mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus have a serious impact on the health of humans and animals. The main mycotoxins produced by species belonging to Aspergillus genus are aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1, G2); ochratoxin A (OTA); fumonisins (B2 and B4); patulin (PAT); cyclopiazonic acid (CPA); gliotoxin (GT) (Abarca et al. 2001; Wilson et al. 2002; Varga et al. 2015; Perrone and Gallo 2017). Although OTA and aflatoxins are the most important Aspergillus mycotoxins in fruits, other mycotoxins synthesized by Aspergillus, such as cyclopiazonic acid, fumonisins, patulin, gliotoxin, and other secondary metabolites, may also elicit toxicological effects (Barkai-Golan 2008)."

The aflatoxins are a group of mycotoxins structurally have related to many secondary metabolites of fungi produced by certain Aspergillus species (Gourama and Bullerman 1995), especially Aspergillus flavus, A. parasiticus, and A. nominus (Garber and Cotty 1997; Fente et al. 2001). Recently, A. ochraceoroseus and A. pseudotamari are also aflatoxin-producing species in nature, but they are less encountered with them (Li et al. 2011). The aflatoxins are extremely potent carcinogenic, teratogenic, mutogenic, hepatotoxin, with hepatocarcinogenic effects and immunosuppressive agents that cause significant damage to human and animal health (Brown et al. 1991; Razzaghi-Abyaneh et al. 2005). Aflatoxins are decaketide-derived secondary metabolites produced by a complex biosynthetic pathway which could lead to different metabolites: aflatoxin M1, M2 (Murphy et al. 2006; Amalaradjou 2008), B1, B2, G1, and G2 (Perrone and Gallo 2017). The most potent and frequently occurring of these compounds is aflatoxin B1 (Richard et al. 1993; Amalaradjou 2008). Mainly AFB1 is the most toxic and carcinogenic naturally occurring mycotoxins, and exhibits hepatocarcinogenic and hepatotoxic properties, and epidemiological data implicating AFB1 as a component of liver cancer in humans in certain parts of the world (Kocsubé et al. 2013). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) assigned all aflatoxins to group 1 (carcinogenic to humans) (Varga et al. 2015).\nAflatoxins are produced in nature only by A. flavus, A. parasiticus, and a recently described species A. nomius. A. flavus is ubiquitous. A. parasiticus is apparently less widely distributed, but the extent of its occurrence may be obscured by the tendency for A. flavus and A. parasiticus to be reported only as A. flavus. A. nomius is not of practical importance (Pitt 2000). Among 18 different types of aflatoxins produced by A. flavus strains (Ismaiel and Papenbrock 2015) these toxins are produced by at least 14 species assigned to three sections of the genus Aspergillus: section Flavi (A. flavus, A. pseudotamarii, A. parasiticus, A. nomius, A. bombycis, A. parvisclerotigenus, A. minisclerotigenes, A. arachidicola, A. togoensis) (Kocsubé et al. 2013), and several other species whose importance and ecology; less importance has some aflatoxin-producing species belonging to section Nidulantes (Emericella astellata, E. venezuelensis, E. olivicola) and section Ochraceorosei (A. ochraceoroseus, A. rambellii) (Perrone and Gallo 2017). Recent data indicate that aflatoxins are produced by at least 20 species assigned to three sections of the genus Aspergillus: sections Flavi, Nidulantes, and Ochraceorosei including the newly described A. pseudonomius, A. pseudocaelatus, A. togoensis, A. mottae, A. sergii, A. transmontanensis, and A. novoparasiticus (Varga et al. 2015)."

Aflatoxins have been found in milk, cheese, corn, peanuts, cottonseed, nuts, almonds, figs, spices, and a variety of other foods and feeds. Milk, eggs, and meat products are contaminated due to the ingestion of aflatoxin-contaminated feed by animals and birds (Amalaradjou 2008). Natural contamination of cereals (maize, wheat, and rice principally), oilseeds (cotton, peanut, rapeseed, coconut, sunflowers, and others), cassava, tobacco, and a long list of other commodities is a common occurrence (Detroy et al. 1971; Diener et al. 1987; Bennett and Klich 2003; Rizzi et al. 2003; Azziz-Baumgartner et al. 2005; Saleemullah et al. 2006; Strosnider et al. 2006; Masoero et al. 2007; Wild and Gong 2010). However, the commodities with the highest risk of aflatoxin contamination are corn, peanuts, and cottonseed. Corn attracted the attention as a commodity of greatest concern worldwide, because it is grown in climates that are likely to contaminate with aflatoxin (Heathcote and Hibbert 1978). Feeding of aflatoxin-contaminated corn and cottonseed meal to dairy cattle can result in aflatoxin M1 contaminated-milk and milk products, including non-fat dry milk, cheese, and yogurt (Amalaradjou 2008). Due to climatic factors, aflatoxins are mainly detected in products imported (e.g., Brazil nuts, pistachio nuts, peanuts, and figs) into Central Europe (Kocsubé et al. 2013).\nA. flavus and A. parasiticus have a particular affinity for nuts and oilseeds. Peanuts, maize, and cottonseed are the three most important crops affected (Pitt 2000). A. flavus, which is primarily known as a producer of the aflatoxins, is a frequent contaminant of corn, peanuts (Domer 2002), stored wheat, onions, grapes, rice, cattle feed, sunflower flour, and spices (Kocsubé et al. 2013)."

Its isolation was part of a large-scale screening for aflatoxins, during the “mycotoxin gold rush” that followed the discovery of aflatoxins (Bayman and Baker 2006). In the following years, the OTA production of six other species from section Circumdati (A. melleus, A. sulphureus (Lai et al. 1970), A. ostianus, A. petrakii, A. sclerotiorum, and A. alliaceus) was reported (Hesseltine et al. 1972; Tsubouchi et  al. 1995), but A. alliaceus is now placed in section Flavi (Bayman and Baker 2006).\nThe economically most important OTA producers belong to Aspergillus sections Circumdati and Nigri, with only two minor OTA-producing species in section Flavi (ochratoxins are produced by a range of Aspergillus species assigned to sections Circumdati, Nigri, and Flavi (Kocsubé et al. 2013; Perrone and Gallo 2017).

The most important mycotoxin is OTA, named after the producer A. ochraceus. Some species of the section are utilized for the biochemical transformation of steroids and alkaloids, or as sources of proteolytic enzymes; while other produces several promising anticancer compounds (Frisvad et al. 2004; Perrone and Gallo 2017). Many species produce large amounts of OTA: A. pseudoelegans, A. sulphureus (Kocsubé et  al. 2013); A. steynii, A. westerdijkiae (Ismaiel and Papenbrock 2015); A. cretensis, A. fresenii, A. flocculosus (syn: A. ochraceopetaliformis), A. muricatus, A. ochraceus, A. pseudoelegans, A. pulvericola, A. roseoglobulosus, A. sclerotiorum (Perrone and Gallo 2017). In section, section Nigri OTA is produced by A. niger (Abarca et al. 1994); A. awamori, A. carbonarius (Teren et al. 1996); A. lacticoffeatus, and A. sclerotioniger (Kocsubé et al. 2013). Members of Aspergillus section Nigri are widely distributed throughout the world. Some are used in the food industry because they are good producers of organic acids and hydrolytic enzymes (Abarca et al. 2001). OTA production in A. niger is alarming because this species is used in fermentations for food and enzyme production; industrial strains should be tested for OTA production (Bayman and Baker 2006). While in Flavi, A. lanosus (Bayman and Baker 2006); A. alliaceus and A. albertensis produce OTA (Kocsubé et al. 2013; Majeed et al. 2013). The ochratoxin family consists of three members A, B, and C which differ slightly from each other in chemical structures (Ciconova et al. 2010). OTA is the most toxic mycotoxin in the group of ochratoxins (Anjorin et al. 2013). OTA may also exhibit teratogenic, genotoxic, mutagenic (Barkai-Golan 2008); carcinogenic and nephrotoxic effects, and also has been regarded as an immunosuppressive agent (Kocsubé et al. 2013)."

More recently, besides cereals and cereal products OTA is found in a range of other food commodities, including legumes (Abarca et al. 2001; Bayman et al. 2002; Bayman and Baker 2006; BarkaiGolan 2008; Perrone and Gallo 2017), coffee beans (Nakajima et al. 1997; Bucheli et al. 2000), cocoa beans, dried fruits (Pitt 2000; Bayman et al. 2002; Aish et al. 2004; Barkai-Golan 2008), peanuts (Pitt 2000; Zain 2011; Adegoke and Letuma 2013; Kocsubé et  al. 2013; Stoev 2013; Perrone and Gallo 2017).

OTA can also contaminate animal-derived products, such as meat (Pitt 2000; Bayman et  al. 2002; Wilson et  al. 2002; Perrone and Gallo 2017), pork, poultry meat (Nakajima et al. 1997; Bucheli et al. 2000), milk (Barkai-Golan 2008; Stoev 2013), fish and eggs (Adegoke and Letuma 2013).\nThe fungi responsible for OTA contamination vary from crop to crop and from place to place. OTA found in cereals in storage is primarily produced by growth of Penicillium verrucosum, and perhaps the associated Aspergillus species, A. ochraceus and A. ostianus (Wilson et al. 2002). A. ochraceus is likely the most important Aspergillus species involved with OTA contamination in storage (Wilson et  al. 2002). In contrast, A. ochraceus is most commonly found in dried and stored foods, such as smoked and salted dried fish, soya beans, chick peas, nuts, pepper, and dried fruit. It has been reported infrequently in cereals and green coffee beans. A. ochraceus is generally present at low levels and rarely causes spoilage (Aish et al. 2004). The most important toxin of the group is OTA; generally A. ochraceus prefers to grow in hot-tropical regions (Alshannaq and Yu 2017). OTA is produced by A. carbonarius in grapes, wines, and vine fruits, and by A. ochraceus sometimes in coffee beans (Pitt 2000; Bayman and Baker 2006). A. carbonarius its major habitat is dried vine fruit. It is therefore the main source of OTA in grapes and grape products, such as raisins and wine. A. niger is often found in association with A. carbonarius and is commonly isolated from nuts, fresh fruit, and some vegetables in warm climates (Aish et  al. 2004). The most important species regarding potential OTA production in coffee, rice, beverages, and other foodstuffs are A. ochraceus, A. westerdijkiae, and A. steynii (Frisvad et al. 2004); and recently, in two newly described species from coffee A. lacticoffeatus and A. sclerotioniger (Samson et al. 2004; Bayman and Baker 2006). Aspergillus species producing OTA in fruits include: A. ochraceus, A. carbonarius, A. niger, A. tubingensis, A. sclerotiorum, A. sulphureus, A. aculeatus, A. japonicus var. aculeatus, A. alliaceus, A. melleus (Barkai-Golan 2008).\nF.

Of particular note and interest is that for some foods, FB1 is not the major fumonisin as it is for maize and other grains. Of current concern is the occurrence of FB2 in wine (Logrieco et al. 2010), in beer (Romero-González et al. 2009) and, together with FB4, in coffee (Noonim et al. 2009; Scott 2012). In recent years, FB2 produced by Aspergilli was detected in coffee beans, beer, other grain-based products, barley, and wheat (Perrone and Gallo 2017). Black Aspergilli were suspected to be responsible for fumonisin contamination of grape-derived products, figs, and onions (Kocsubé et  al. 2013). Among Aspergilli, A. niger and A. welwitschiae are fumonisin producers. A. niger is frequently detected on grape-derived products, while A. welwitschiae infects onions and Welwitschiae mirabilis (Varga et al. 2015)."

PAT is a water-soluble lactone first isolated as an antibiotic during the 1940s. Owing to co-discovery of the compound by various groups, it has historically been known by names such as clavicin, clavitin, expansin, gigantic acid, leucopin, mycoin, penicidin, and tercinin. Initially isolated as a broadspectrum antifungal antibiotic, it was later found to inhibit more than 75 different bacterial species including both Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria (Moake et al. 2005). The early findings that PAT had antibiotic activity led to its testing against the common cold in humans. PAT was soon found almost useless in curing the common cold and was too toxic for use as an antimicrobial agent (Ismaiel and Papenbrock 2015). During the 1960s it was found to be toxic to biological systems comprising of bacteria, mammalian cell cultures, higher plants, and animals. The adverse effects of patulin in biological systems are genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity, immunotoxicity, and genotoxicity (Erdoğan et al. 2014).\nPAT is a fungal secondary metabolite that produced by some Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Byssochlamys mold species (Kadakal and Nas 2002). PAT has been isolated from Aspergillus terreus (Jiménez et al. 1991), A. clavatus, A. giganteus, A. longivesica (Varga et al. 2007). Several Aspergillus species are also able to produce patulin, including species assigned to Aspergillus sections Clavati and Terrei (Kocsubé et al. 2013). Among the Aspergillus species, the number of patulin producing species is limited to three of the Clavati group: A. clavatus, A. giganteus, and A. longivesica (Puel et al. 2010).\nF. A.

While it predominantly contaminates apples, apple juice, and apple products, other fruit including pears, peach, and grapes may also be vulnerable to patulin contamination (Moake et al. 2005). Several studies have shown that patulin is stable in dry cereals, and in apple and grape juice (Speijers 2004), apricots, grapes, grape fruit, peaches, pears, apples, olives and cereals (Laidou et al. 2001; Kadakal and Nas 2002; Adegoke and Letuma 2013), dried fig (Senyuva and Gilbert 2008).

It is mainly produced in rotten parts of the fruits after infestation with PAT-producing fungus that can occur at 0  °C during storage or develops rapidly when fruits are returned to room temperature. PAT also appears to increase after storage when fruits remain at room temperature (20  °C) for short periods of time, a common procedure in fruit processing industries (Ismaiel and Papenbrock 2015). The contamination of PAT in fruit and fruit-derived products, especially in apple and derived products is very common worldwide (Alshannaq and Yu 2017).

Its name was derived from its identification as a metabolite of Gliocladium fimbriatum first isolated from cultures of the fungus Gliocladium fimbriatum (Nouri et al. 2015). GT is a sulfur-containing mycotoxin produced by several fungal species belonging to genera including Penicillium, Gliocladium, Thermoascus, and Aspergillus (Sugui et  al. 2007). Regarding Aspergillus, GT is produced by A. fumigatus and related species in section Fumigati including A. denticulatus, A. cejpii, and A. pseudofischeri. Even though pathogenic Aspergillus including A. niger, A. flavus, and A. terreus, and A. chevalieri (Varga et al. 2015), the most abundantly produced gliotoxins A. fumigatus, which exhibits a diverse array of biologic effects on the immune system (Lewis et al. 2005).\nA. fumigatus produces a variety of secondary metabolites, including gliotoxin, and this mycotoxin has received considerable attention for over two decades as a\n7 Aspergillus Mycotoxins: Potential as Biocontrol Agents\n226\nputative virulence factor based on the following observations: (1) up to 93% of A. fumigatus strains recovered from cancer patients with IA produced gliotoxin compared to less than 20% of the environmental isolates (2) A. fumigatus is the most prolific producer of gliotoxin among the pathogenic Aspergillus species tested (Sugui et  al. 2007). Production of gliotoxin from clinical isolates of various Aspergillus species indicated that most of the A. fumigatus isolates produced gliotoxin (95%) in comparison with other Aspergillus species (Kupfahl et al. 2008). The amount of toxin produced by A. fumigatus was substantially higher than the amount produced by other less frequent species of pathogenic Aspergillus including A. terreus and A. flavus.\nThe most common species of Aspergillus that cause invasive aspergillosis worldwide are A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A. flavus, and A. niger. Although all the species produce gliotoxin, not every strain is a gliotoxin producer (Kwon-Chung and Sugui 2009). GT is an alkaloid with a low molecular size which has been known to possess a number of immunosuppressive activities, such as inhibition of superoxide release, migration, microbicidal activity cytokine release by leukoyctes, and T-lymphocytemediated cytotoxicity (Kamei and Watanabe 2005), also have genotoxic, cytotoxic, and apoptotic effects. A recent study demonstrated the presence of gliotoxin in cattle feedstuff. However, information is scarce about the presence of A. fumigatus and its mycotoxins in other feedstuffs (Pena et al. 2010). This mycotoxin has been suspected as one of the most likely virulence determinants among various secondary metabolites produced by the species (Nouri et al. 2015)."

Previous studies claimed that environmental isolates of A. fumigatus rarely produce gliotoxin, in contrast to clinical isolates (Lewis et al. 2005). Kosalec et al. (2005) studied the in vitro production of gliotoxin in clinical strains of A. fumigatus and demonstrated that incubation at 37 °C resulted in higher gliotoxin production than at 25 °C. They found that gliotoxin was produced during mycelial growth (Keller et al. 2012). Other studies showed the isolation of A. fumigatus from cereal grains and other animal feed silages with ability to produce gliotoxin (Garon et al. 2006; Kupfahl et al. 2008; Richard et al. 2009).\nThe A. fumigatus strains isolated from mixed cattle feed had higher gliotoxin levels than those isolated from corn silage (Pereyra et al. 2008).

The original isolate (P. cyclopium) was later referred to as P. griseofulvum and P. verrucosum var. cyclopium) Domer 2002). However, some strains of Aspergillus are also producers of CPA mycotoxin such as A. flavus (Luk et al. 1977; Trucksess et al. 1987). At the outbreak of Turkey X disease in Britain in the early 1960s may well have been a combination of aflatoxin and CPA, which are often produced concurrently (Trucksess et al. 1987; Gallagher et al. 1978).\nFurther, empirical evidence indicates that commercial samples of CPA may be contaminated with, among other things, aflatoxin, yielding sometimes variable and confusing experimental data (Voss et al. 1990). Similarly to aflatoxins, CPA also been detected in both the mycelium and the sclerotia of A. flavus (Wicklow and Cole 1982: Barkai-Golan 2008).

Mycotoxins might play a role in terms of economic and safe farming procedure (Yadav et al. 2019b, 2020c; Rastegari et al. 2020a). The effects of mycotoxins on insects have already been addressed by several research groups 50 years ago (Schrögel and Wätjen 2019). Insects encounter mycotoxins when they consume fungus-infected mummy fruits from their host plants. Mycotoxins can cause toxicity to insects, including insecticidal effects and developmental delay (Zeng et al. 2006). There are many reports concerning the toxicity of mycotoxins towards insects (Rastegari et  al. 2020b; Yadav et  al. 2020b). AFB1 proved to be harmful to Drosophila melanogaster, Aedes aegypti, Heterotermes indicola, Heliothis virescens, Corcyra cephalonica, mycophagous mites, Musca domestica, Locusta migratoria, Schistocerca gregoria, and Tenebrio molitor (Reiss 1975).\nThere is variable sensitivity of insects to aflatoxin toxicity, initially examined in the fruit fly D. melanogaster (Alderman and Marth 1976), drosophila with larval growth in media contaminated with AFB1 leading to decreased viability, and small pupal case (Bettinger and Chinnici 1991). PAT had insecticidal activity towards D. melanogaster and Lucilia sericata. In concentrations of 20, 10, and 1 pg/cma PAT had strong insecticidal activities (Reiss 1975). D. melanogaster larvae, which feed naturally on fermenting fruits, exhibit significantly altered development on diets containing low AFB1 concentrations (i.e., less than 1 ppm); larvae feeding on\nF. A. Abo Nouh et al.\n229\nhigher concentrations will die (Niu et al. 2009). Toll-deficient D. melanogaster was significantly less susceptible to GT of the A. fumigatus (Kwon-Chung and Sugui 2009)\nZeng et  al. (2006) described toxicity of AFB1 to the corn earworm (CEW) (Helicoverpa zea) (Lepidoptera: Nuctuidae) larvae at different larval stages. For newly hatched first instar larvae 20 ng/g AFB1 caused 50% mortality while a higher concentration 200 ng/g AFB1 caused 100% mortality. Pupal weight of the larvae fed with 1 ng/g AFB1 in diet was significantly decreased compared with control insects. Low concentrations of AFB1 in the diet of first instars (less than 100 ng/g) can affect development, causing delayed pupation and reduced pupal weight; higher concentrations of AFB1 (200 ng/g) are lethal (Zeng et al. 2006).\nSpores of Aspergillus flavus have been observed to be highly pathogenic to freshly emerged house flies (Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae) by ingestion or even by contact (Amonkar and Nair 1965). A. flavus showed developmental toxicity also to rice moth larvae (Hedge et al. 1967). Feeding aflatoxin to larvae of mosquitos and house flies as well as to young Heliothis virescens (Lepidoptera: Nuctuidae) led to high mortality rates (Schrögel and Wätjen 2019).\nAbado-Becognee et  al. (1998) investigated the effect of fumonisin B1 on the growth and metabolism of yellow mealworm molitor. The presence of fumonisin B1 at a concentration of 450 μg/g diet reduced larval growth and metabolism for several weeks, but did not increase mortality (Broekhoven et al. 2014). Guo et al. (2014) observed the parameters of food choice, weight gain, and mortality for larvae T. molitor when reared on wheat grains colonized by various Fusarium species. Compared to the control grain several grains were avoided by the larvae while others were preferred by the larvae, which correlated with larval feeding behavior and weight gain. However, larvae were not always able to sense threats derived from infested grain, as among the preferred grains one grain which was colonized by Fusarium culmorum led to increased mortality (Schrögel and Wätjen 2019). The growth rate of yellow mealworm larvae is decreased also by AFB1 and OTA (Schrögel and Wätjen 2019).\nThe A. flavus isolates were obtained from coconut insect pests naturally colonized cadavers of Stephanitis typica (lace bug) (nymphs and adults), Opisina arenosella (leaf-eating caterpillar) (larval stages), and Proutista moesta (plant hopper) (adults). The laboratory bioassay conducted with these fungi on the respective hosts yielded 80% mortality of S. typica nymphs within 3 days; 80–90% O. arenosella larvae were mycosed within 3–4 days (Gopal et al. 2000a) and 62.5% P. moesta insects died within 4 days (Ponnamma et al. 2000) under laboratory conditions. The mortality was 100% when the experiment was continued for 2–3 days more. The ideal spore concentration for achieving 100% mortality in short period (5–6 days) was 106 spores ml−1 (Gopal et al. 2000b). In response to A. flavus infection, within 24 h, the insects became lethargic, refused food indicating loss of appetite, and did not respond to external stimuli. After death due to fungal parasitism, their body became mummified and brittle (Gupta and Gopal 2002). In this background, the toxigenic nature of A. flavus isolates (AF1 and AF2) pathogenic to S. typica, O.\n7 Aspergillus Mycotoxins: Potential as Biocontrol Agents\n230\narenosella, and P. moesta tested for their possible use as biological control agents against some of the insect pests of coconut(Gupta and Gopal 2002).\nThe navel orange worm (NOW) (Amyelois transitella) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is a serious crop pest that attacks almonds, pistachio, walnuts, and figs, causing millions of dollars of agricultural damage in the United States (Connell 2001; Campbell et al. 2003; Burks and Brandl 2004). Niu et al. (2009) demonstrated the extremely high tolerance of A. transitella to concentrations of AFB1 and OTA and showed that this tolerance exceeds that of other mycotoxin-associated species such as H. zea. The concentrations analyzed did not kill A. transitella when administered at early developmental stages and caused only marginal sub lethal effects. Comparisons of the toxicological effects in A. transitella and H. zea demonstrated that A. transitella larvae are 100 times more tolerant of AFB1 than H. zea and also are significantly more resistant to OTA.\nGT has been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of an array of different fungal species including A. nidulans, A. terreus, A. niger and has been utilized as an antifungal, antibiotic, most notably in the treatment of soilborne fungi (Howell & Stipanovic 1995; Aliaa 2008; Losada et al. 2009). Similarly, GT has been demonstrated to possess antibacterial properties inhibiting proteasomal activity in certain bacterial strains (Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum and ultimately growth (Paugam et al. 2002; Hatabu et al. 2006). Patulin has also been evaluated for control of several plant pathogens, including downy mildew of cucumbers, damping off of safflower, crown gall, and loose smut of wheat (Stott and Bullerman 1975). Strong fungistatic activity by PAT against Rhizopus nigricans, Monilia albicans, and Sporotrichum schenckii but no effect upon Aspergillus clavatus a PAT producer (Stott and Bullerman 1975). PAT was initially suggested for treatment of common cold, as it is anti-viral in addition to being antibacterial, but the trials on humans were quickly dropped because of the toxicity of PAT (Frisvad 2018)."

      "text" : "Trichoderma is a saprotrophic fungus which largely can be found in environments such as forest soil, roots and leaves. This fungus has been declared as soil fungi due to its significant for their fast growth. They exhibited high capacity to utilize different types of complex substrates and can act as a strong resistances towards different kind of toxic chemicals. Therefore, Trichoderma species is very abundance on decaying wood. This is mainly because of the heterotropic interactions such as decomposition and opportunistic endophytism. It can be found in all type of soils which includes from forest, salt marsh, agricultural even in desert soils. In addition to that, Trichoderma has been used as an efficient biocontrol agent against the phytopathogens (Sharma et al. 2019). The main mechanisms for the biocontrol process in this type of fungi have been assumed due to antibiosis, mycoparasitism and competition for space and resources (Bissett et al. 2015).\nThis fungus evolved many mechanisms which contribute for the improvement of the plant resistance towards diseases, the plant’s growth as well as its productivity (Rastegari et al. 2020; Yadav et al. 2020d, 2019b). According to Bissett et al. (2015), out of 260 species, around 35 established species was mainly discovered for its economic importance mainly due to its capability of various enzyme productions or to be used as biocontrol agents. Global interest was given to researches related to Trichoderma fungus thanks to its applications in the field of agricultural and biotechnology (Verma et al. 2017a).\nTrichoderma has been thought to be associated with plants as epiphytes and endophytes. Epiphytes are beneficial microflora that can be found at the aerial parts of the plants that can be either harmful or beneficial towards the plant (Yadav et al. 2020b, c). The word endo derived from the Greek words which carry the meaning of within and “phyte” stands for plant. In another word, endophytes are the colonization which takes place inside the plants by any fungus or bacteria (Suman et al. 2016; Verma et al. 2017a; Yadav et al. 2020a). There are few reports supporting the fact that Trichoderma species found as endophytes of the plants. One of the wellknown examples is the presence of Trichoderma in banana tissues (Wang et  al. 2000). According to the Pocasangre et al. (2000) study on the distribution of endophytic fungi from banana was conducted which is mainly about isolating the fungus from the central cylinder. Besides that, Sikora et al. (2008) did survey on isolating endorhiza of banana and use it for biocontrol of nematodes.\n8.2 Methodology of Studying Trichoderma Biodiversity\nMost of the species identification for Trichoderma species has been performed according to their morphological characteristics. In order to carry out this, solid media with different components which are targeted for conidium production and its branching observation were used for the culture characteristics as well as for the\nH. A. El Enshasy et al.\n241\nmorphological studies (Hermosa et al. 2000). Most of the times, the morphological studies which aimed for conidiosphores structure identification can be done by referring to the taxonomic keys and the information provided by the literature studies. However, without having any professional expertise this practice may lead to incorrect conclusion. In order to overcome this issue for better species identification, biochemical and molecular methods are highly recommended (Photita et al. 2001).\nOne of the useful tools which used for better species identification and give data for the ecological purpose of the species is metabolic profiling technique which also provides the possibilities of the quantitative measurement of the growth and consumption of different carbon and nitrogen sources. According to Kredics et  al. (2011), the cellulose-acetate electrophoresis based isoenyzme analysis with using glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, peptidases A, B and D and phoshoglucomutase enzymes was used for isolation and identification of Trichoderma strains which derived from some clinical samples and wheat fields. On the other hand, another alternative for the biochemical technique was suggested by Neuhof et al. (2007), where the identification process was mainly based on intact-cell mass spectrometry. This method will help to identify hydrophobins in the mycelia as well as spores of the strains. The patterns of the hydrophobin reflect the characteristic of the species that being isolate and this method can also give a rapid and direct identification of class II hydrophobins (Hanada et al. 2008).\nWhen it comes to the molecular methods, methods like the DNA-fingerprinting, the sequence analysis of ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the segments from genes encoding for the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), endochitinase (chi18-5, formerly known as ech42), RNA polymerase II subunit (rpb2) and calmodulin (cal1) is the suitable method for giving the accurate species identification for Trichoderma strains (Druzhinina et  al. 2008). The TrichOKEY which is also known as ITS-based online barcoding program becomes another useful tool for the species identification. For the analysis of tef1, ITS and rpb2 sequences the online programme known as TrichoBLAST and its updated version named TrichoMARK can be used. As an example, according to Nagy et al. (2007), by using the online barcoding programme name TrichoCHIT, any potential chitinase producing strain such as Trichoderma harzianum was used. Moreover, species-specific primers in polymerase chain reaction can be used for a quick and precise diagnosis. According to Kredics et al. (2011), this method allows for a fast and specific identification of Trichoderma pleurotum and Trichoderma pleuroticola. Both the strain is known as agent that causes the formation of green mould in the global production of Pleurotus ostreatus within the growing substrate and without any requirement of cultivation time (Xia et al. 2011a, b).\nThe studies related to Trichoderma biodiversity mainly based on the standard culture approach which contains the collection of samples, the isolation of Trichoderma strains on selective media, however when this method is being applied, some strains can be easily identified and there are some which is even harder to do the isolation procedure. The diversity that had been detected by using this method\n8 Trichoderma: Biocontrol Agents for Promoting Plant Growth and Soil Health\n242\ndoes not reflect the accurate diversity of the genus from the tested habitat. The metagenomic method provides the best solution to overcome this problem as it examining the habitat without doing any isolation or culturing of the strains. When the first attempt is done on biodiversity detection using this metagenomic approach by Hagn et al. (2007) the primers for Trichoderma specific were created for the ITSI fragment of the rRNA gene cluster. However, using this approach, only around 12 species have been identified as this ITSI alone is could not identify all the species because certain strains share the same allele (Samuels et al. 2006).\nTo overcome these issues, Meincke et al. (2010) created the primer pair which is specific for Trichoderma for diversity analysis purpose. This specific primer help to amplify around 650 bp fragment of the ITS region which is suitable for identification by TrichOKEY and TrichoBLAST. The very first PCR-amplification was performed by having fungal specific forward primer and Trichoderma-specific reverse primer. For the second reaction, the Trichoderma-specific forward and reverse primers are used together. The ITS amplicons help to denature the gradient gel electrophoresis or help to clone to the pGEM-T easy vector. The currently developed primer system was applied on Trichoderma communities in the rhizosphere of potatoes. But this method could not detect the several species because reverse primer is located 30  bp upstream of the last genus-specific TrichOKEY hallmark (Nawaz et al. 2018).\nHowever, in a recent study conducted by Nawaz et al. (2018), six reverse primers were designed and their specificity and selectivity were tested. Along with the forward primer ITS5 this reverse primer can help to amplify the whole diagnostic region of ITS1. The six separated PCR amplifications from the tested soil that contain same forward and one reverse primers were combined, purified and subcloned to pGEM-T. The sequences of the individual clones were determined and analysed with TrichOKEY 2.0 and TrichoBLAST. Atanasova et al. (2010) applied this strategy to determine the diversity of the strain in samples.\n8.3 Trichoderma Diversity in Different Habitats"

      "text" : "Danielson and Davey (1973) found out that at the south part of the USA and at the state of Washington, Trichoderma can be found at variety of forest soil. Some of the strains like Trichoderma polysporum and Trichoderma viride were located near the strictly cool temperature regions. Trichoderma harzianum was isolated from warm climate area, while Trichoderma hamatum and Trichoderma pseudokoningii were dominantly growing at area with excessive moisture. Besides that, the isolation, morphological characterization as well as full identification of strains like Trichoderma aureoviride, T. harzianum, T. koningii, T. longibrachiatum and T. viride\nH. A. El Enshasy et al.\n243\nfrom area like the wood of the oak, cork wood and dead wood of the apple twigs have been studied (Vasanthakumari and Shivanna 2011).\nThe broad studies on the biodiversity of Trichoderma were conducted in North America and at some region in Europe. The isolated Trichoderma strains were analysed for their function to degrade the organochlorine xenobiotics but as mentioned earlier, the results from this method are difficult to be evaluated. This is mainly due to the fact that there is no available of molecular tools for the identification (Vasanthakumari and Shivanna 2011). According to Zhang et al. (2005), around 135 isolates of Trichoderma were obtained from four regions of China which are from Hebei, the northmost side, followed by Zheji-ang, the south-east side, Yunnan, west part and from the Himalayan part as well. The result from this study indicates from among the North to South part, the Northern China finalized as potential centre for origin of the haplotype of Trichoderma harzianum (Vasanthakumari and Shivanna 2011).\nOne the other hand, Abd-Elsalam et al. (2010) isolated the fungi strain from the soil of protected area in Saudi Arabia and the identification process were carried out by suing M13-microsatelite PCR and ITS barcoding. Results from the investigation reveal that Trichoderma harzianum and Trichoderma longibrachiatum are present. The biodiversity study of Trichoderma from the European river floodplain habitat near the Danube national park, which was originally known for its riparian forest area in Vienna, Austria was carried out mainly based on the morphological examinations, sequence analysis of the ITS region and fragment of the tef1 gene as RAPD analysis (Zhang et al. 2005). Plant litter associated fungi was examined from the spring of the sheep herd in the western of Norway and isolated wide variety of fungi which includes two Trichoderma strains. However, the authors failed to determine the species by NCBI BLAST for its ITS sequences. But by using TrichOKEY the isolated named as Trichoderma hamatum while other were identified as Trichoderma koningiopsis (Sun et al. 2012).\nA wide-scale survey was done over 14 European countries which have temperate climate in order to learn about the biodiversity of Trichoderma by testing their morphology, ITS and tef1 sequences. Around 75 species were detected from European countries. By doing ITS barcoding-based study, some of the strains are found from soil and decaying wood. Then taxon-specific metagenomic method was used by Friedl and Druzhinina (2012), in order to determine the Trichoderma biodiversity in situ in soil samples from aspen and beech forests along the Danube floodplain. The obtained result shows that not only small number of Trichoderma species were capable of forming teleomorph but suggested that the biodiversity of the genus is higher on and above the small layer than inside the soil. Some of the strains associated with the host fungi or trees were found but the major of the species suggested to be necrotrophic on diverse fungi on wood and tree bark (Samuels et al. 2012b).\n8 Trichoderma: Biocontrol Agents for Promoting Plant Growth and Soil Health\n244"

      "text" : "Living plants or endophytes can be defined as organisms which live within the plant cells. They established a relationship with the plant that varies from symbiotic to pathogenic (Bailey et  al. 2006). There are certain types of Trichoderma strains which are capable of colonizing the root part of the plant and continue to have a symbiotic relationship with that particular plant. There has been a lot of investigation being carried out in order to prove that Trichoderma strains can develop endophytic relationship within the inner tissue part of the plant (Samuels et al. 2012a).\nTheobroma cacao which commonly known as cocoa plant was become the first target to carry out the study as this plant can grow easily at any country which have tropical climates. In South America the most common diseases that cause by this cocoa plant are black pod, witches broom and frosty pod rot. To overcome this major issue, extensive study was carried out on the endophytic microbial community of the cocoa plant (Samuels et al. 2012a). From this study, it was concluded that several fungus strains such as Trichoderma koningii, T. ovalisporum, and T. koningiopsis can play its role as endophytes in the cocoa plant (Degenkolb et al. 2008).\nAccording to the study done by Rubini et al. (2005), diversity study about endophytic fungi in the cocoa plant give rise for variety of fungal strains but low prevalence was given to the isolated strains. Posada et al. (2007) reported that there are few endophytic microbiota can be found in the coffee seedlings which contain some of the Trichoderma strains such as Trichoderma harzianum and Trichoderma hamatum.\nBesides the cocoa plant, similar studies were also conducted on other plants. One of the good example for this scenario is the Hevea spp. which also known as rubber tree. According to Chaverri et al. (2011), a new species named Trichoderma amazonicum was isolated from this rubber tree. In Mexico, two other Trichoderma fungus functioned as endophyte in two different plants. Zhang et al. (2007) Trichoderma strain was identified from Taxus mairei, while Samuels et  al. (2012b) identified Trichoderma solani from the tubers of Solanum hintonii. Six types of Trichoderma species were identified from the banana root where four of them were from the inside the root, while the rest two were isolated from the surface of the root. Among the species Trichoderma asperllum and Trichoderma virens showed the highest frequencies in the samples (Xia et al. 2011a, b).\nAccording to Dang et al. (2010), Trichoderma ovalisporum was isolated from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant where the strain shows effective antibacterial activity against several pathogenic microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Trichoderma strains were also isolated from other important medicinal plants such as Huperzia serrata and Salvia miltiorrhiza. Strains also were detected from some of the carnivorous plants. Some studies were done on Drosera rotundifolia which is also known as common sundew during the season of autumn and spring by Quilliam and Jones (2010). Trichoderma viride was isolated from all the samples. Other carnivorous plant which is Pinguicula vulgaris was also studied for the potential endophytic fungi. The root and seed from Dendrobium nobile and\nH. A. El Enshasy et al.\n245\nDendrobium chrysanthum also studied for the presence of endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi (Ming et al. 2012). Numerous studies and efforts were taken to overcome the growth of the harmful pathogenic fungi, Rhizoctonia solani. This fungus has the ability to cause serious quality as well as quantity damages on the potato tuber. However, the endophytic fungi that isolated from the potato plants were tested and based on the obtained result, isolates of Trichoderma atroviride show the highest inhibition against R. solani due to the mycoparasitic phenomena (Chen et al. 2011)."

(2007), Trichoderma species can be isolated from air of different environment which varies from outdoor to indoor air. Some good example of indoor air samples are those from heated wooden chips inside the buildings, from air filters that being used in hospitals, air ducts of the households, air conditioners, and achieve storage facilities. Trichoderma can be isolated from the outdoor air samples as well which normally from the rooftop of hospitals and houses. The air samples from agricultural area can be potential for this fungus isolation as well. According to Madsen et al. (2007) the dust blown from hay in England can be used for the isolation purpose. However, no species level identification was done for the samples that has been isolated from the air samples and settles dust. From the clinical wise, presence of conidia in the air plays a significant role for the occurrence of allergic diseases and can cause the infections like sinusitis or pneumonia. On the other hand, Hansen et al. (2010) concluded that Trichoderma harzianum which used as biocontrol agent can be detected in the air only during the treatment period."

      "text" : "Abiotic and biotic stress plays a significant role towards the population and diversity of any microbial communities in the agricultural ecosystems (Rana et al. 2019a, b; Yadav et al. 2018a). This includes the species of the plant and its growth stage, soil physical and properties of the chemical that being used, usage of pesticides, the geographical region and most importantly the total microbial competition (Druzhinina et al. 2011). Trichoderma spp can be isolated from any type of agricultural fields as it exhinited significant positive impacts on plant cultivation. Those impacts include its role as efficient biocontrol agent, induction of systemic resistance, increase the uptake of nutrient, promote the plant growth and degradation of any pesticides that can bring negative impact to the soil. The rhizosphere attracts this fungus by having the presence of different soil borne fungi which function as its\n8 Trichoderma: Biocontrol Agents for Promoting Plant Growth and Soil Health\n246\nprey and rich derived nutrient. The members of Trichoderma are preferred to be isolated from rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil rather than phyllosphere. Some of the species are ubiquitous where some are limited to certain geographical areas (Kour et al. 2019c).\nAs mentioned earlier, the isolation of this fungus from various agricultural crop fields was carried out to conduct studies on its biological control ability against phytopathogens, so only limited number of studies that deal with the population, abundance and diversity of the genus of Trichoderma from specific crop fields were carried out. Trichoderma spp can be highly found in cereal crop fields and is one of the dominating fungi and prevalent taxa among other fungal communities. When it comes to the cereal crop field, the weather, the type of soil and farming management bring big influence to the distribution of the Trichoderma spp. Six different species of the fungus were discovered by the ITS barcoding and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) from the rhizosphere, rhizoplane and the soil bulk of potato (Liang et al. 2004).\nFrom the rhizosphere of coffee, Trichoderma isolates also have been discovered particularly from the soil of the coffee plants in the forest and semi-distributed forest area. The identification was done by ITS barcoding. Either its cultivated or uncultivated coffee regions, both of the different area show higher diversity of this isolates but the indices and the evenness for this isolates were the same at the both the habitats. Some chemical properties and the altitude of the samples concluded that the growth of the isolates was not preferred by the ecological perspective. It was also concluded that the host plant influence the genetic diversity of Trichoderma strains. Around 135 isolates of Trichoderma were collected from the rhizospheres of cocoa plant of different locations (Pavone and Domenico 2012).\nFrom the rhizosphere of sugar beet, sixteen isolates were collected and the identification process was done based on the morphology, ITS and tef1 analysis. When it comes to the oilseed rape rhizosphere, Trichoderma spp. were the most prevalent fungi and most importantly it showed high biodiversity and specificity in the bulk soil of oilseed rape. Another most important plant that acts as a rhizosphere for Trichoderma isolates is the oil palm. Among the isolates strains, Trichoderma harzianum and Trichoderma virens were the most prevalent species that had been recovered from the soils of oil palm in Malaysia. Population wise, it shows the high in both the cultivated and semi-cultivated oil palm ecosystems. However, the population increased when empty fruit bunches were added to the fields and the moisture content and the pH of the soil did not bring any effect towards the distribution of the strains. In conclusion the diversity and the abundance of the Trichoderma were higher in bulk soil than in rhizosphere soil (Naeimi et al. 2011).\nH. A. El Enshasy et al.\n247\n8.5 Trichoderma: Promoting Healthy Plant Growth\nIn the recent time, Trichoderma spp. has been widely suggested to be used for efficient plant growth as a good plant growth promoting fungi (PGPF). These have capability of producing some of the secondary metabolites in particularly siderophores, phosphate-solubilizing enzymes and phytohormones for plant growth and soil health (Doni et al. 2013; Kour et al. 2019b; Yadav 2019). This plant growth promoting traits is considered one of their beneficial trait and this traits can be seen through different type of mechanisms such as antibiosis, degradation of toxins, mycoparasitism, inactivation of pathogenic enzymatic pathway and also but not least the enhanced nutrient uptake which leads to the overall development (Lorito et al. 2010; Kaur et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2019; Singh et al. 2020). This fungus is known as hemibiotrophic fungus which is effective towards reducing the severity of the plant diseases by several mechanisms which have been mentioned above (Fontanelle et al. 2011). Most of the secondary metabolites produced by Trichoderma are strain dependent, can contain both volatile and nonvolatile antifungal substances and it is rhizosphere-competent strains which mainly involve in colonizing the surface root which have been shown for causing direct impact on the plants. It helps to increase the nutrient uptakes which eventually leads to better physical growth of the plant (Gal-Hemed et al. 2011).\nAccording to Doni et al. (2014), the usage of Trichoderma as plant growth promoter shows significant positive impact towards the height of the plant, number of leaf and the length of the root. The possibilities for this to occur are mainly because of mechanisms which involve nutrient usage and the tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress. In addition to that, phytohormones produced by this fungus play a pivotal role for the enhanced growth of the plant. Some of the reports include phytohormones such as cytokinin like molecules and gibberellins related molecules can make biological enhancement on the crop fertility. On the other hand, Kashyap et al. (2017) also mentioned that the rice which inoculated with the Trichoderma shows higher photosynthetic rate. Other good impact shown by rice with the presence of Trichoderma is better uptake of the nutrients and increased resistance towards drought. On the other hand, maize plant, this fungus increased the plant’s biomass production as well as developed better root hair. Trichoderma also helped to increase the seed germination process, increase the osmotic, salinity and chilling by initiate the physiological protection against any form of cellular damage (Mastouri et al. 2010).\nThe interaction in between Trichoderma harzianum strain and tomato-root system was also studied at the beginning stage of the root colonization. The presences of the fungus inoculation in the production medium cause the profuse adhesion of the hyphae to the roots and the colonization of the root epidermis and cortex. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) shows the hyphal growth and the formation of the papilla like hyphal tips which induced by the plant.\nTrichoderma harzianum in particular is able to control and inhibit the growth of B. cinerea on grapes by colonize the blossom tissue and exclude the pathogen from\n8 Trichoderma: Biocontrol Agents for Promoting Plant Growth and Soil Health\n248\nthe infected side. According to Kashyap et al. (2017), Trichoderma species used the competition for nutrient as their major mechanisms to inhibit the soil microorganisms. In addition to that, Trichoderma has the advantage of mobilizing and take up all the nutrients which makes much more efficient and more competitive than many other soil microbes. However, the biotic components of the soil have several impacts on the bio control activity of Trichoderma against other plant pathogens. According to Kashyap et al. (2017), when the Gfp contained mutant strain used, it shows higher level of microbial soil biomass that induce the shift from the hyphal growth to sporulate in Trichoderma (Table 8.1).\n8.6 Trichoderma: Biological Control Agent\nFungi have been used for biocontrol purpose in much modern agricultural system. This is mainly because most of the fungi have the ability to reduce the negative impact of plant pathogen (Rana et al. 2020; Yadav et al. 2018b). Trichoderma sp. have gained much more interest than any other fungi due to their surviving ability under any form of unfavourable condition, high capacity for reproductive purpose,\nH. A. El Enshasy et al.\n249\ncapability to resist against other plant pathogenic fungi and can able to produce secondary metabolites (Contreras-Comejo et al. 2016; Benítez et al. 2004). Besides that, this fungus has been also used in various biotechnological applications and used in agriculture field mainly to enhance the growth and the yield of the plants (Lorito et al. 2010; Hermosa et al. 2012).\nAny form of penetration or interaction in plant roots normally will activate its immune system but in case of Trichoderma sp. it will remodel the immune system of the plant and help it to be recognized as non-pathogenic plant. The strains of the fungus can able to eliminate the synthesis of JA and ET which mainly involved in inducing systematic resistance (Hermosa et  al. 2012). The systematic resistance induced by T. asperellum or T. harzianum T39 against B. cinerea in A. thaliana was determined as well. Trichoderma sp. plays an important role when it comes to suppressing the formation of any plant disease and plant pathogen in both the field condition and greenhouse condition. The fungus can produce wide range of elicitors which will interact with the receptors and recognition of Trichoderma and this will lead to the induction of resistance in the plant (Salas-Marina et al. 2011). In addition, different types of Trichoderma strains are able to produce little amount of secondary metabolites and these metabolites seem to induce the pathogenesisrelated protein and eventually reduce the symptoms of any disease (Vinale et al. 2006). Through the mycoparasistm process, Trichoderma can parasitize the plant pathogen during different stages of development. This is done by producing several enzymes such as chitinase, proteases and glucanases which will help to flow the nutrient into the mycoparasite and finally degrade the host of the pathogen (Inch and Gilbert 2011). Table 8.2 shows the different Trichoderma strains against different bacterial pathogens.\nBoth the mono and dicotyledonous species show strong resistance towards attack of various pathogens when the plant is well pre-treated with Trichoderma. The plant colonization caused by this fungus inhibits the growth of different pathogens at the side of inoculation and also when the biocontrol fungus inoculated at different times or sites than that of the pathogen. In addition to that, the resistance of the plant shown by the colonization of some of the Trichoderma sp. is pretty much similar to that elicited by the rhizobacteria where it enhance the defense system of the plant but do not directly involve with the production of the pathogenesis-related proteins known as PR proteins. Recent studies have been done at the molecular level by using the high-density oligonucleotide microarray approach and it was found out that the gene induced by Trichoderma was associated with the biotic and abiotic stresses and also RNA, DNA and protein metabolism. The genes that codify for the extensin and also extensin look like proteins were mainly induced by the biological agents.\nThe plant starts to interact with Trichoderma, different types of metabolites which belong to different classes will start to be produced as elicitors or as resistance inducers (Woo and Lorito 2007). Proteins with enzymatic activity such as xylanase, avirulence are able to induce the plant defence mechanisms and induce the production of low molecular weight compound as a result of fungus–plant interaction. Some of these low molecular weight compounds which have the ability to\n8 Trichoderma: Biocontrol Agents for Promoting Plant Growth and Soil Health\n250\ndegrade fungal cell wall have been purified and further characterized. These compounds have been mainly composed of oligosaccharides with or without amino acids moiety. In these interaction mechanisms Trichoderma activates the mycoparasitic gene expression cascade. Besides the activated antimicrobial effect, their action might stimulate the biological activity of the resident antagonistic microbial populations or the introduced Trichoderma strains and this will induce the effect of induced systematic resistance on the plant."

      "text" : "There are several compounds which are not involved for the normal growth and the reproduction of any organisms. These compounds are called as secondary metabolites. However, they play pivotal role when it comes to the development, signaling and the interaction between one organism and other (Rastegari et al. 2019; Yadav et al. 2019a; Saxena et al. 2016). The absence of these metabolites will result in the long term impairment on the survival of the organism rather than causing a direct and immediate death. According to Mukherjee et al. (2012), certain environmental\nH. A. El Enshasy et al.\n251\nfactors will cause the organism to be dependent on the secondary metabolites such as in case of iron deficiency as siderophores act as replacement to support growth. Plants use these secondary metabolites as a defence system against herbivores and other inters species. According to Vipul et al. (2014), humans use it for medicine, flavourings and drug creation purposes. On the other hand, it also can be used as efficient weapon against other pathogenic bacteria, amoeba, fungi, insects and even large animals. Secondary metabolites can be used as agent for symbiosis purpose between plants and other organisms (Kour et al. 2019a).\nCommonly known as filamentous fungi, Trichoderma spp., can be found nearly in most of the soils and other habitats. They have the capability of adapting to different ecological conditions and lifestyles. Trichoderma fungus has economical important mainly due to the fact that it can be used as a good biocontrol agent which help to inhibit the growth of phytopathogenic fungi. It can be functioned as biocontrol agent because of the presence of extracellular enzymes and secondary metabolites. Particularly the secondary metabolites produced by the fungus can be used in biotechnological and pharmaceutical purposes. This includes secondary metabolites such as peptaibols, non-ribosomal peptides, terpenes, steroid and many more. Although there have been 373 different molecules that have been identified so far, their specific activity is still cannot be determined.\nAccording to Verma et  al. (2017b), these fungal biocontrol agents have been mainly used against any soil related diseases. In order for them to perform as an efficient biocontrol agent they must show different mechanisms of action when it comes to their antagonistic interaction with any fungal pathogens. Some good examples are the mycoparasitism, antibiotic activity, basic competitions for nutrients, induction of systematic resistance and cell wall lytic enzyme activity. Trichodermin, gliovirin and harzianic acid are the best known metabolites that being produced by Trichoderma species (Singh 2010). Strains such as T. viride, T. harzianum and T. atroviride are capable of producing pyrone (6-pentyl-2Hpyran-2-one). These metabolites are the main reason behind the release of coconut aroma. Pyrone is also known for its antifungal activity against plant pathogenic fungi. The fungus also produces cytosporone which show strong in vitro antibiotic activity against some pathogenic bacteria and fungi.\nKoninginis metabolites are also capable of inhibiting the growth of fungus such as Gaeumannomyces graminis var. It also can kill some of the soil-borne plant pathogens such as Fusarium oxysporum, Pythium middletonii, Rhizoctonia solani and many more (Vinale et al. 2006). These secondary metabolites in particular can prevent the spore germination by the fungal pathogens. According to Vinale et al. (2006), a secondary metabolite called T22 azaphilone from the liquid culture of T. harzianum was isolated. These metabolites inhibit several plant pathogens such as R. solani and G. graminis var. Trichoderma hamatum produces viridiol which reduces and at certain circumstances inhibits mycotoxin like aflatoxin which produced during the fungal interaction. So the usage of this secondary metabolites produced by Trichoderma strains can induce the resistance level of the host and also promote the yield of the crop which can be the most suitable replacement for the chemical usages. Due to the presence of the secondary metabolites, Trichoderma\n8 Trichoderma: Biocontrol Agents for Promoting Plant Growth and Soil Health\n252\nstrains can also be used as biofertilizers where there are two strains, namely Trichoderma harzianum T22 and T39 used as active agents for various commercial biopesticides and biofertilizers.\nMost of the fungus around the world has the ability to produce potential toxins in the form of antibiotics which can kill other pathogenic microbes regardless its concentration level. The differences in between these antibiotics somehow show different activities against both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Paracelsin is the first antibiotic discovered that produced by the species Trichoderma. Most of the time it produces large compounds that have the antibiotic activity and this production is mainly dependent on the factors such as pH, temperature and quantity of microorganisms. A single Trichoderma species can produce different type of antibiotic compounds and likewise the given antibiotic has the potential of being produced by different strains. However, according to the study done by Sivasithamparam and Ghisalberti (2014), it revealed that different isolates of same species can produce different compounds as well.\nTrichoderma harzianum often leads to the production of antibiotic where the methanolic extract from the dual culture of this fungus showed strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, general Trichoderma species that can be found in marine habitat also known to produce bioactive metabolites such as antimycobacterial. According to the study conducted by Wu et al. (2014), from the culture of marine Trichoderma strain tentatively named as MF106, the particular strain shows antimicrobial effects towards human pathogenic strains such as Staphylococcus aureus. The strains also known to be used for the protection purpose of grapevine wounds from the infected trunk pathogens. In a nutshell, Trichoderma spp. can be used on a wide spectrum for both in vitro and in vivo (Kotze et al. 2011)."

There is some investigation being carried out in order to overcome this problem. One of the well-known steps is the usage of chemical pesticides to control the growth of these pathogenic microorganisms (Yadav et  al. 2018a, b). However, using chemical pesticides can cause long term effect towards the human health as well as the environment. Thus, eco-friendly alternatives have been approached to replace the usage of the chemical pesticides.\nTrichoderma fungus can be an eco-friendly replacement for the chemical pesticides due to its ability of producing hydrolytic enzymes. The cell wall of the fungus can able to produce hydrolytic enzymes such as cellulase, chitinase and more. This enzyme plays a pivotal role when it comes to the degradation of biomass (Schuster and Schmoll 2010). The cell wall of Trichoderma is mainly made up of β-1,3glucans and chitin and sometimes cellulose in some of the oomycetes. There are\nH. A. El Enshasy et al.\n253\nsome demonstrations that have been done to give a clear picture on how some of the Trichoderma strains produce hydrolytic enzymes to inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms such as in case of Trichoderm harzianum.\nIn most cases, the production of this enzymes mainly depends on factors such as availability of type of carbon source, presence of light, growth rate and secretion stress (Tisch and Schmoll 2013). Besides than the strain that have been mentioned above, Trichoderma reesei is another widely used strain which produces cellulose and the hemicellulose degrading enzyme. Both of these enzymes are highly used for industrial purposes. Häkkinen et al. (2012) mentioned that a complex system will be formed by the large number of carbohydrate active enzymes that being produced by the fungus which will be regulated by the series of environmental and physical factors. Trichoderma hamatum on the other hand possesses high antimicrobial activity mainly because it consists of specific β-glucanase and chitinase. Both of these enzymes play significant role when it comes to the cell wall degradation. According to Ahmed et al. (2009) three type of glucanases: exoglucanase (EXG), endoglucanase (EG), and β-glucosidase (BGL) have been isolated from Trichoderma harzianum. These enzymes also being used for malting, baking, alcohol production, paper and textile industries (Galante et al. 2014)."

Based on the high capacity of Trichoderma for the production of hydrolysis enzymes, primary and secondary metabolites, it is strongly believed that this microbe has very high potential in biotechnology industries. In addition, this microbe has high capacity to grow on wide range of cheap substrates as a result of the high capacity to produce wide range of hydrolases enzymes to breakdown the complex carbon and nitrogen sources. The high capacity for enzyme excretion makes it also a very attractive biofactory for native and recombinant enzyme production.

Focusing on fungal microbe’s endophytes P. indica were defined as organisms that colonize in living plant tissue during their entire life cycle (Kusari and Spiteller 2012; Anitha et al. 2013; Lugtenberg et al. 2016; Arora and Ramawat 2017; Jain and Pundir 2017; Khare et al. 2018; Lata et al. 2018; Abo Nouh 2019; Chhipa and Deshmukh 2019); and live in a broad variety of host plant species (e.g., barley, maize, parsley, poplar, tobacco, and wheat) without causing disease symptoms (Desisa 2017).\nThe symbiotic fungus P. indica displays an endophytic lifestyle and has the ability to colonize the root cortex cells of a wide range of mono- and dicotyledonous plants, displaying a broad range of beneficial effects to the host (Baltruschat et al. 2008; Sherameti et al. 2005, 2008; Waller et al. 2005; Yadav et al. 2010; Lahrmann and Zuccaro 2012). The root endophyte fungus P. indica enhances the tolerance of colonized plants against drought, acidity, heavy metals, and various other abiotic stresses as well as biotic stresses (microbial pathogens/insects), promotes nutrient uptake, and stimulates growth and seed production (Verma et al. 1998; Varma et al. 1999; Sahay and Varma. 1999; Peškan-Berghöfer et al. 2004; Waller et al. 2005, 2008; Oelmüller et al. 2009; Krishnaveni et al. 2014; Basu et al. 2016; Justice et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2018).\n9.2 History of P. indica and Systemic Position\nDuring a routine isolation of AM fungi in the desert Thar (Rajasthan, India), Verma and his collaborators were isolated P. indica for the first time from the soil of two xerophytic plants, namely Prosopis juliflora and Ziziphus nummularia as a contaminant (Verma et al. 1998; Varma et al. 2013). At the first superficial view it seems that the isolated spore is a vesicle of an AM fungus and belongs to a fungus of the Glomeromycota. But this spore was well growing on artificial complex media (P. indica can be easily cultivated in axenic culture). Therefore, this species could not be a member of the Glomeromycota because Glomeromycota are growing in biotrophic interaction with plants only (Verma et al. 1998). The isolated fungus was described as a new species of family Sebacinaceae, order Sebacinales, phylum Hymenomycetes, Basidiomycota. The fungus was named P. indica based on its characteristic pear-shaped chlamydospores (Verma et al. 1998; Varma et al. 1999; Kost and Rexer 2013; Varma et al. 2013; Krishnaveni et al. 2014; Pan et al. 2017). P. indica, an axenically cultivable phytopromotional, is a biotrophic mutualistic root endosymbiont and has been reported to mimic capabilities of typical arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Gill et al. 2016). They also lack cystidia and structures formed during cytokinesis on some basidiomycetous hyphae, the so-called clamp connections. Like other cultivable species of the Sebacinales, P. indica forms moniliod hyphae, which look like pearls in a chain (Selosse et al. 2007). The first\nF. A. Abo Nouh et al.\n263\nexperiments with P. indica revealed that the co-cultivation of the fungus together with young maize seedlings causes a strong support for the growth of their shoots (Kost and Rexer 2013).\n9.3 The Diversity of P. indica and Plant Habitat\nP. indica is a cultivable fungus and can grow on synthetic media without a host (Verma et al. 1998; Peškan-Berghöfer et al. 2004). The host range includes trees, agricultural, horticultural, monocots, dicots, and mosses (Glen et al. 2002; PeškanBerghöfer et  al. 2004; Barazani et  al. 2005; Sherameti et  al. 2005; Waller et  al. 2005), suggesting that the interaction is based on general recognition and signaling processes (Camehl et al. 2013). Inoculation of a broad variety of plants with P. indica had a positive effect on their general biomass production (Varma et al. 1999), and subsequent analyses showed that P. indica exerts a variety of physiological effects. It promotes the establishment of micro-propagated plants (Sahay and Varma 1999), adventitious root formation in cuttings, and lignan production of hairy root cultures; enhances flowering; increases yield; and induces higher tolerance of and resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses (Waller et al. 2005).\nP. indica has been termed as plant probiotic because of its plant growth- promoting activity and its role in enhancement of the tolerance of the host plants against abiotic and biotic stresses (Basu et al. 2016). The fungus possesses unique properties to act as biofertilizer, bioprotector, and immunoregulator. It also plays a key role in protecting roots from insects by increasing the tolerance of the host roots (Varma et al. 1999; Waller et al. 2005; Serfling et al. 2007; Prasad et al. 2008; Bagde et al. 2010). The underlying mechanism of the fungus beneficial activity is not yet understood, but it is observed that the plant antioxidant system is activated and thus implicated in the improvement of abiotic and biotic stress tolerance (Waller et al. 2005; Varma et al. 2013). P. indica is capable to colonize with the root of both gymnosperm and angiosperm and the colonization is restricted to the rhizodermis (Deshmukh et al. 2006). P. indica tremendously improves the growth and overall biomass of diverse hosts including legumes (Verma et al. 1998; Varma et al. 1999); industrial crops (Singh et al. 2011); important plants such as Oryza sativa, Zea mays, Tridax procumbens, Nicotiana tabacum, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Brassica oleracea var. capitata (Varma et al. 2012a); tobacco (Tanha et al. 2014); the agriculturally important barley, the model plants (Lugtenberg et al. 2016); and medicinal plants such as Artemisia annua, Abrus precatorius, Azadirachta indica, Bacopa monnieri, Curcuma longa, Linum album, Stevia rebaudiana, Trigonella foenum-graecum (Oelmüller et al. 2009, Kumar et al. 2017). It colonizes the root cortex, grows interand intracellularly, forms pear-shaped spores within the cortex and extramatrically, and does not invade the endodermis and the aerial parts of the plants (Oelmüller et al. 2009; Abo Nouh 2019).\nThis fungus can colonize roots of a wide range of higher plants and provide plants with multifaceted amenities such as nutrient uptake, disease resistance, stress\n9 Piriformospora indica: Endophytic Fungus for Salt Stress Tolerance…\n264\ntolerance, and growth promotion involving value addition (Unnikumar et al. 2013). Interaction between P. indica and Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris cv. Chinensis) results in growth and biomass promotion of the host plant and in particular in root hair development (Dong et al. 2013). P. indica can be cultivated easily on synthetic media and colonized with cabbage and spinach of Brassicaceae family, in contrast to Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (Bagheri et al. 2014). Unlike AM fungi, P. indica can grow without a plant host. This characteristic is advantageous for mass production and potential commercialization because production does not require the additional complexity of growing plants to rear the fungus. P. indica also colonizes plants that AM fungi cannot, such as members of the Brassicaceae family (Deshmukh et al. 2006) and members of Cruciferae family (Gosal et al. 2013).\nP. indica has been reported to perform multifarious functions e.g. biological hardening during transplantation of micro-propagated plantlets (Singh et al. 2003), and increased endogenous content of spilanthol after realization of its mutual interaction with medicinal plants such as Spilanthes calva (Rai et al. 2004). P. indica colonizes the epidermal and rhizodermal parts of the Arabidopsis roots and root hairs, and forms pear-shaped spores. The hyphae never invade the endodermis or central meristematic tissue of the root and never proceed to aerial systems, stem, or foliage. Propagation of the fungus does not only exclusively occur within the cells, but also at the root surface and in its environment (soil system). Interaction between the two partners leads to growth promotion of the seedlings (Oelmüller et al. 2009). P. indica infestation in Helianthus annuus and Aristolochia elegans has resulted into the stimulated synthesis of valuable compounds (Bagde et al. 2010; Gill et al. 2016). Mutualistic fungi P. indica, added to propagation media, have been shown to increase root weight and root initiation in a range of plant species, including dwarf umbrella tree (Schefflera arboricola), anglojap yew (Taxus media), bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), geranium (Pelargonium sp.), rose (Rosa ‘Scarlet Cupido’), malabar nut (Adhatoda vasica), and poinsettia (Justice et al. 2018).\n9.4 P. indica Strategies for Root Colonization and Interaction Structures\nOne of the specific features of P. indica is the ability to interact with the roots of many plant species of different taxa. The morphology of the interacting structures depends on the involved partners. These interacting partners could be mosses, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms (Kost and Rexer 2013). Some facts related with the lifestyle and the mechanisms underlying root colonization of P. indica from its interaction with many plants (such as Hordeum vulgare and Arabidopsis thaliana) have been unraveled (Deshmukh et al. 2006; Schäfer and Kogel 2009). Within the host plant root tissues, structures similar to arbuscules and vesicles occur in the intercellular spaces as well as may be packed intracellularly which enhances the interaction interface among the microsymbiont and the host plant tissues or may act\nF. A. Abo Nouh et al.\n265\nas storage organ of the microsymbiont (Gosal et al. 2013). All plant species, which are able to form one of the different mycorrhizal types, can be used by Piriformospora as a host (Kost and Rexer 2013). Generally, symbionts colonize rhizodermal and cortical cell layers of roots. The sites of P. indica infection include the root tip, root hairs, and the root differentiation zone from where the fungus reaches the cortical tissue and starts producing spores in epidermis and cortex within a week.\nThe intracellular existence of this fungus indicates its potential to exist inside root cells as hyphae and spores, without provoking tissue necrotization (Deshmukh et al. 2006; Gosal et al. 2013). Root colonization by P. indica is also known to start within interacellular chlamydospore germination and forming extracellular hyphal mats, and simultaneously penetrating rhizodermal and cortical cells (Deshmukh et al. 2006; Jacobs et al. 2011). The fungus either colonizes roots intracellularly via rhizodermal cells or penetrates cortical cells after an initial intercellular growth phase. Root colonization gradiently increases with tissue age as the maturation zone is predominantly colonized, while the fungus is almost absent at the meristematic zone. Accordingly, sporulation is mainly found at extracellular regions of the maturation zone in addition to intracellular sporulation at rhizodermal and cortical cells of the same tissue (Jacobs et al. 2013). P. indica forms typical pyriform chlamydospores which act as perennation bodies similar to the AM spores and forms extended hyphal structures that ramify the soil in vicinity of the host roots hunting and accumulating nutrients like phosphorus, iron, manganese, zinc, and many more from a diameter of several square meters of the soil (Gosal et al. 2013).\nThe colonization patterns of the various root regions harbor some quantitative as well as qualitative differences, which distinguish P. indica on H. vulgare and A. thaliana from endomycorrhizal fungi. The fungal root colonization increases with root maturation and the highest fungal biomass has been found in the differentiation, particularly in the root hair zones (Deshmukh et al. 2006). Importantly, the physiological activity of host cells has been considered as a prerequisite for efficient nutrient exchange between the symbiotic partners (Schäfer and Kogel 2009). Thus, root colonization pattern of P. indica differs from than that of AM fungi, which are known to prefer entially colonize younger root parts (Gill et al. 2016). P. indica with plants, especially emphasizing its life strategies in host plants, has shown that root colonization by P. indica and its lifestyle in plant may vary depending on the environmental factors, the genetic predisposition, and the developmental stage of host plants and plant organs, respectively (Desisa 2017).\nInteraction structures occur in P. indica by two ways according to Kost and Rexer (2013): Endophytic and Necrotrophic Mode of Life and Biotrophic Interaction with Living Plant Cells.\n9 Piriformospora indica: Endophytic Fungus for Salt Stress Tolerance…\n266"

P. indica is able to destroy the cells at the beginning of the interaction and behaves itself like a necrotrophic parasite in some cases (Deshmukh et al. 2006; Kogel et al. 2006; Schäfer et al. 2007). If hyphae of P. indica invade into a plant cell, the hyphal tip forms a small inconspicuous appressorium on the surface of the outer wall of the rhizoids or root cells. After the plant cell wall is locally dissoluted by fungal enzymes, the hyphal tip intrudes into the plant cell. Mostly the invaded root cells of plant species are killed before infection, or they die off during the contact phase of the hyphae. The fungal hyphae cross the cell wall with thin penetration peg. The cell content will be saprophytically decomposed by the fungus. Very often P. indica develops its chlamydospores inside these dead root cells (Kost and Rexer 2013). The established fungus is located within the root’s cortical cells but does not colonize or damage meristematic cells (Harman and Uphoff 2019)."

      "heading" : "9.5 Effects of Biotic and Abiotic Stresses on Plants",
      "text" : "Due to global warming, and potential climate abnormalities associated with it, plants have evolved to live in environments where they are often exposed to number of abiotic and biotic stress combinations (Rastegari et  al. 2020a, b; Yadav et  al. 2020e). Being sessile, they have developed specific mechanisms that allow them to detect precise environmental changes and respond to complex stress conditions, minimizing damage while conserving valuable resources for growth and reproduction (Fig. 9.1). Plants activate a specific and unique stress response when subjected to a combination of multiple stresses (Atkinson and Urwin 2012). Based on the number of interacting factors, stresses can be grouped into three categories: single,\nF. A. Abo Nouh et al.\n267\nmultiple individual, and combined stresses. A single stress represents only one stress factor affecting plant growth and development, whereas multiple stresses represent the impact of two or more stresses occurring at different time periods without any overlap (multiple individual) or occurring concurrently with at least some degree of overlap between them (combined) (Singh and Yadav 2020; Yadav et al. 2020a, b). The co-occurrence of drought and heat stresses during summer is an example of a combined abiotic stress, whereas a bacterial and fungal pathogen attacking a plant at the same time represents a case of combined biotic stress (Kour et al. 2020a, b; Pandey et al. 2017). Plants are faced with numerous biotic stresses and adverse environmental conditions. They respond to these stresses through several morphological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms and evidence suggests that there are interactions among their respective signaling pathways (Gimenez et al. 2018; Kour et al. 2020c; Yadav et al. 2017).\nAbiotic stress factors such as heat, cold, drought, salinity, and nutrient stress have a huge impact on world agriculture, and it has been suggested that they reduce average yields by >50% for most major crop plants (Yadav and Yadav 2018; Wang et al. 2003; Atkinson and Urwin 2012). Abiotic stresses have become an integral part of crop production. In general, plants suffer from dehydration or osmotic stress under drought, salinity, and low temperature condition which causes reduced availability of water (dehydration) for cellular function and maintenance of cellular turgor pressure (Kumar et al. 2019a; Varma et al. 2013; Yadav et al. 2019e). Plants become nutrient deficient and lose their normal physiological pattern of growth and\n9 Piriformospora indica: Endophytic Fungus for Salt Stress Tolerance…\n268\ndevelopment due to varying levels of acidic conditions; early exposure to salinity results in ion toxicity; drought decreases germination rates, causes inhibition of photosynthesis, loss of membrane integrity, and increased generation of reactive oxygen species (Lata et al. 2018; Yadav et al. 2019a).\nDrought, heat, and salt stress affect plant–water relations triggering complex plant responses, which include increased production of osmolytes (Bohnert et al. 1995; Wang et al. 2003; Verma et al. 2017). Osmotic potential is determined primarily by two components: solute potential and matrix potential, and it is likely that symbiotic fungi contribute to the matrix potential, which is particularly important in helping plants retain water and thereby enhance plant drought tolerance (Rodriguez et al. 2008). Plant growth is greatly affected by drought stress and plants must adapt to this stress to survive (Xiong et al. 2002; Bartels and Sunkar 2005; YamaguchiShinozaki and Shinozaki 2006, Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki 2007). Drought and salinity are two major environmental factors determining plant productivity and plant distribution (Rana et al. 2019b; Yadav et al. 2018a, b). Drought and salinity affect more than 10% of arable land, and desertification and salinization are rapidly increasing on a global scale declining average yields for most major crop plants by more than 50% (Bartels and Sunkar 2005; Kour et al. 2019a, c). Salt stress affects plants in numerous ways such as ion toxicity, nutritional disorders, physiological drought, oxidative stress, modification of metabolic processes, membrane incompetence, and reduction of cell division. When plant is exposed to high salt at germination it causes physiological drought and reduction in leaf expansion (Kumar et al. 2019b, c). The osmotic effects of salinity stress can be observed immediately after salt application and are believed to continue for the duration of exposure, resulting in inhibited cell expansion and cell division, as well as stomatal closure (Munns 2002). Exposure to drought or salt stress triggers many common reactions in plants. Both stresses lead to cellular dehydration, which causes osmotic stress and removal of water from the cytoplasm into the extracellular space resulting in a reduction of the cytosolic and vacuolar volumes. Another consequence is the production of reactive oxygen species which then in turn affects cellular structures and metabolism negatively (Bartels and Sunkar 2005).\nOne of the severe factors is salt accumulation in soil, limiting the productivity of plants, that causes adverse effects on germination, plant growth, and crop yield (Munns and Tester 2008). Salt stress causes loss of water use efficacy, increases ions, induces heat stress, and reduces stem extension. Biological macromolecules are damaged due to production of free ions. It was found that salinity stress resulted in decrease of water content, accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, and electrolyte release in plants (Batool et al. 2014). High salt concentration in soil is a main factor that limits the yield of agricultural crops (Munns and Tester 2008). High salinity affects plants in two main ways: high concentrations of salts in the soil disturb the capacity of roots to extract water and high concentrations of salts within the plant itself can be toxic, resulting in an inhibition of many physiological and biochemical processes such as nutrient uptake and assimilation (Carillo et al. 2011).\nAt low salt concentrations, yields are mildly affected or not affected at all. As the concentrations increase, the yields move towards zero, since most plants,\nF. A. Abo Nouh et al.\n269\nglycophytes, including most crop plants, will not grow in high concentrations of salt and are severely inhibited or even killed by 100–200 mM NaCl. The reason is that they have evolved under conditions of low soil salinity and do not display salt tolerance (Carillo et al. 2011). Salt stress has been shown to affect carbohydrate partitioning and metabolism, leading to the synthesis of new compounds. In plants exposed to salinity, the total nonstructural carbohydrate content in the leaves was reduced significantly compared with plants that are not exposed to salinity. The decrease in total soluble carbohydrates due to salinity could also be related to limited carbohydrate availability as a consequence of a decline in photosynthesis (Zarea et al. 2013).\nDrought stress induces a range of physiological and biochemical responses in plants such as stomatal closure, repression of growth and photosynthesis, and activation of respiration (Kour et al. 2019b; Yadav et al. 2019b; Singh et al. 2011). Heat and drought stress in particular can cause disproportionate damage to crops compared with either stress individually. However, when examining the effects of an abiotic stress with simultaneous impact of a pathogen or herbivore, both positive and negative interactions have been observed depending on the timing, nature, and severity of each stress. An increase in temperature can create a negative interactive effect by lowering resistance to bacterial, viral, fungal, and nematode pathogens: in wheat (Atkinson and Urwin 2012; Verma et  al. 2016, 2019). Drought stress can cause detrimental effects to plant pathogen resistance. In both sorghum and the common bean, drought-treated plants had a higher susceptibility to the charcoal rot fungus Macrophomina phaseolina. Similarly, drought stress increased the spread of fungal and bacterial leaf scorch symptoms on date. Exposure of Arabidopsis to drought stress allowed greater infection levels of an avirulent isolate of P. syringae (Atkinson and Urwin 2012).\nDrought is one of the major abiotic stress limiting plants growth and productivity in many areas of the world. Expansion of drought leads to osmotic stress, specific ions toxicity, and ionic imbalances (Tanha et al. 2014). Drought stress induces a range of physiological and biochemical responses in plants such as stomatal closure (Schroeder et al. 2001). Prolonged water stress causes decline in leaf water potential and stomatal opening, reduces leaf size, suppresses root growth, reduces seed number, size, and viability, delays flowering and fruiting, and limits plant growth and productivity, while high salinity and drought have been the major causes of osmotic stress to plants (Lata et al. 2018).\nUpon exposure to heat stress, non-symbiotic panic grass and tomato plants significantly increased osmolyte concentrations as predicted. Increased osmolyte concentrations correlated with the development of subsequent wilting and desiccation symptoms prior to plant death (Rodriguez et al. 2008). Higher temperature results in extensive denaturation and aggregation of cellular proteins, which, if unchecked, lead to cell death. Low temperature impairs metabolic processes, through alterations in membrane properties, changes in structure of proteins and interactions between macromolecules as well as inhibition of enzymatic reactions (Lata et al. 2018). Heavy metals interfere with numerous biochemical and physiological\n9 Piriformospora indica: Endophytic Fungus for Salt Stress Tolerance…\n270\nprocesses including photosynthesis, respiration, nitrogen and protein metabolism, and nutrient uptake (Lata et al. 2018).\nThe plant has to bear several biotic stresses like the infection by a variety of phytopathogens belonging to diverse groups of viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, insects, and higher animals particular concern for the herbivores (Gosal et al. 2013). Biotic stresses mainly result in disease in plants. Microorganisms can cause plant wilt, leaf spots, root rot, seed damage, and many more problems. Insects can cause severe physical damage to plants, including to the leaves, stem, bark, and flowers. Insects’ canals act as a vector of viruses and bacteria from infected plants to healthy plants. Invasive plants through allelopathy cause severe damage to native plants (Lata et al. 2018). There are two types of fungi parasites: nectrotrophs, which kill host cells using toxins, and biotrophs. Together with bacteria, they cause vascular wilts, leaf spots, and cankers among other symptoms, and can infect different parts of the plant. Nematodes withdraw the contents of plant cells and can feed on all parts of the plant, but plant parasitic nematodes primarily cause soil-borne diseases and attack plants’ root system. They produce symptoms related to nutrient deficiency, such as wilting or stunting. Viruses produce not only local lesions but also systemic damage that causes stunting, chlorosis, and malformations affecting different parts of the plant, although they rarely kill their hosts. On the other hand, insects and mites are the pest to be highlighted. They damage plants through feeding or egg laying (Gimenez et al. 2018).\nIn contrast, abiotic stress may also interact positively with pathogen stress. In barley, increase in salt-induced osmotic stress was directly correlated with resistance to powdery mildew, while drought stress can enhance resistance to the fungus Botrytis cinerea in tomato. Pathogens may also actively interfere with plant–water relations in order to increase pathogenesis. For example, they may cause stomatal closure to reduce water loss from infected tissues, thus having a positive effect on plant tolerance against abiotic stress (Atkinson and Urwin 2012). Infection with viruses can actually provide protection from drought stress. In virus-infected tobacco, beet, and rice drought symptoms appeared later and leaves maintained water longer than their uninfected counterparts (Atkinson and Urwin 2012). Abiotic stress conditions also directly affect plant–pest interactions by altering plant physiology and defense responses. Additionally, abiotic stress conditions such as drought enhance competitive interactions of weeds on crops as several weeds exhibit enhanced water use efficiency than crops, and also known to influence the occurrence and spread of pathogens, insects, and weeds (Pandey et al. 2017). On the other hand, drought stress is reported to provide endurance to tomato, Medicago sativa, and Arabidopsis thaliana against Botrytis cinerea (causal agent of gray mold), Oidium neolycopersici (causal agent of powdery mildew), Verticillium albo-atrum (causal agent of verticillium wilt), and Pseudomonas syringae (causal agent of bacterial speck disease), respectively (Pandey et al. 2017).\nF. A. Abo Nouh et al.\n271\n9.6 P. indica Fungal Endophytes for Conferring Salt Stress Tolerance\nSalinity is the concentration of dissolved mineral salts present in the soils (soil solution) and waters. The dissolved mineral salts consist of the electrolytes of cations and anions. The major cations in saline soil solutions consist of Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+, and the major anions are Cl−, SO42−, HCO3−, CO32−, and NO3− (Zarea et  al. 2013). The composition and concentration of soluble salts in root zone medium solution are known to influence plant growth, both by creating osmotic imbalance and via specific physiological toxicity of ions. Osmotic stress lowers the potential energy of the solution and causes reduced growth, due to the additional energy required by plants to take up water (Zarea et al. 2013). P. indica is known to impart tolerance towards many abiotic stress factors like extreme cold temperature, drought, and saline soil conditions (Gosal et al. 2013).\nThe main mechanisms thought to be involved in salt stress alleviation by P. indica fungus may be summarized as follows: (1) improvement of mineral nutrition leading to plant growth promotion and (2) modification of some physiological processes and enzymatic activities involved in plant antioxidative reactions (Zarea et al. 2013). During salt and drought stress, P. indica maintains a high antioxidative environment by primarily inducing the defense system. Also, it has shown to induce several antioxidative enzymes during salt and drought stress that are involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), peroxidase (POD), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR). P. indica also increased the level of osmolytes (polyamines, proline, etc.), in response to salinity and drought stress (Varma et al. 2013). Salinity affects all important processes, such as growth, photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and lipid and energy metabolism, resulting in all phases of plant life from germination to seed production (Bagheri et al. 2014).\nP. indica has been shown to increase resistance against tolerance to abiotic stress in plants. Fungal colonization has shown to promote plant growth which is a characteristic effect and can also be observed under stress conditions. P. indica modulates the defense system and alters the metabolism to compensate the loss in photosynthesis and prevent oxidative damage caused by stress (Varma et al. 2013). Waller et al. (2005) investigated salt stress tolerance in barley leaves which were exposed to moderate and high salt concentrations in hydroponic culture. The plants show leaf chlorosis and reduced growth. The detrimental effect of moderate salt stress is completely abolished by P. indica, as shown by the fact that infested plants produce higher biomass than non-stressed control plants under these conditions.\nP. indica can with stand alkaline pH up to 11.0. The fungus found to have optimum growth at pH 6.0–10.0. Increase in cell dry biomass and radial growth along with presence of significant amount of chlamydospores at a wide range of pH 4.0–11.0 has been recorded for P. indica. The fungus can tolerate and shows prominent growth and metabolism at low acidic pH 4.0 to high alkaline pH 11.0 (Basu\n9 Piriformospora indica: Endophytic Fungus for Salt Stress Tolerance…\n272\net al. 2016). P. indica a root endophytic fungus has already been proved to have beneficial influence on plant growth especially under water scarcity and salt stress (Basu et al. 2016). P. indica also increased plant tolerance to abiotic stresses including salt stress in barley (Baltruschat et al. 2008; Alikhani et al. 2013), tomato (Cruz et al. 2010), and wheat (Rabiey et al. 2015). The fungus conferred drought tolerance in Chinese cabbage and enhanced seed production and grain yield (Sun et al. 2010). Interaction between barley and P. indica has been studied with respect to salt tolerance, and findings have suggested that barley was able to tolerate moderate salt stress (100 mM) in hydroponic culture (Waller et al. 2005). They investigated salt stress tolerance in barley leaves which were exposed to moderate (100 mM NaCl) and high (300 mM NaCl) salt concentrations in hydroponic culture. They found that detrimental effect of moderate salt stress was completely abolished by P. indica, with a higher biomass gain. However, under high salt stress conditions, both noninfested and infested plants exhibited a severe biomass reduction. Also, P. indica has shown to induce elevated amount of ascorbic acid and increase activities of antioxidant enzymes in barley roots during its symbiotic association under salt stress conditions suggesting that antioxidants might play a role in both inherited and endophyte-mediated plant tolerance to salinity (Baltruschat et al. 2008; Varma et al. 2013). Waller et al. (2005) observed that the root endophytic fungus P. indica had increased Hordeum vulgare L. tolerance to salt stress. Similarly, they showed that P. indica protects H. vulgare from high salt stress (300  mM NaCl) (Terhonen et al. 2019).\nTolerance of plants to salt stress is associated with the alleviation of antioxidant enzymes as suggested by earlier studies (Rodriguez et  al. 2008). Considerable research has been carried out on the mechanism of salt stress tolerance conferred to plants colonized with P. indica and this trait has been demonstrated for barley as well as wheat, rice, and tobacco and involves the induction of a high antioxidant environment for the detoxification of reactive oxygen species and an enhanced photosynthetic efficiency (Johnson et al. 2014). According to Basu et al. (2016) P. indica showed a tendency to grow under calcareous condition with at high alkaline pH in vitro.\nThe study explores the possibilities of P. indica as an excellent bio-inoculant for nutrient management in calcareous soil. Present study was conducted to understand P. indica capacity to withstand high alkaline pH. P indica was also subjected to stress of different concentration of calcium carbonate with respect to calcareous soil. This study has great significance as the fungus is being exploited and tested for bioremediation of calcareous soil. The pre-colonization of roots with P. indica resulted in decreased disease severity in tomato caused by early blight. They concluded that P. indica treatments led to priming of defense-related gene expression in tomato. Recent studies have shown that root fungal endophytes of agricultural crops can help host plants to live in harsh environments, thereby increasing their stress tolerance against abiotic factors (Terhonen et al. 2019).\nF. A. Abo Nouh et al.\n273\n9.7 P. indica Fungal Endophytes for Conferring Disease Resistance\nBiotic stress results due to damage done to plants by other living microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and organisms such as beneficial and harmful insects, weeds, and cultivated or native plants (Lata et  al. 2018; Yadav 2017a, b). Fungal endophytes are capable of protecting the plant against pathogens through various strategies, such as competition with pathogens for colonization and nutrients, the production of antibiotics, and the induction of resistance in the host plant (Kumar et al. 2019; Suman et al. 2016; Yadav et al. 2018c, 2019d). P. indica is an interesting endophytic fungus capable of colonizing roots and forming symbiotic relationship with every possible plant on earth (Desisa 2017). Biotic stress protection by P. indica was first shown in barley roots. P. indica enhanced barley grain yield, tolerance to mild salt stress, and resistance against root and leaf pathogens, including the necrotrophic fungus F. culmorum (root rot) and the biotrophic fungus Blumeria graminis. Beneficial effects are also observed for the crops like wheat, maize, and rice (Waller et al. 2005; Oelmüller et al. 2009). P. indica colonizes the cortex of roots of a wide variety of plant species, promotes their growth, and induces resistance against soil-borne fungal pathogens in a manner similar to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.\nThe inoculation of P. indica followed by colonization of the internal tissues of the plant may impart systemic resistance to various fungal and bacterial pathogens (Gosal et al. 2013). On inoculation, P. indica vigorously infects host root tissue and blocks the receptors for the attachment and adsorption of the phytopathogens which could be considered as the nonspecific physical way of this beneficial fungus to safeguard the inoculated plant (Gosal et al. 2013). P. indica-infested plants are more resistant to biotic stress. When barley plants are exposed to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen F. culmorum, P. indica-infested plants are more resistant to root diseases. Root infection of wild-type plants causes a severe reduction in the root fresh weight and this devastating effect is strongly diminished in the presence of P. indica (Waller et al. 2005; Oelmüller et al. 2009).\nIn barley, the root endophyte P. indica confers disease resistance by a different mechanism. Symbiotic plants are thought to resist necrotrophic root pathogens due to increased activity of glutathione–ascorbate antioxidant systems (Waller et  al. 2005; Rodriguez and Redman 2008). P. indica has been shown to increase resistance to biotic stresses including a wheat leaf disease (caused by B. graminis), a wheat stem base disease (caused by Oculimacula spp.), wheat and barley root rot diseases (caused by F. culmorum, Gaeumannomyces graminis) (Serfling et al. 2007; Harrach et al. 2013), a maize root disease (caused by F. verticillioides) (Kumar et al. 2009), a lentil vascular wilt disease (caused by F. oxysporum) (Dolatabadi et  al. 2012), crown rot disease (caused by F. culmorum and F. graminearum) (Rabiey et al. 2015). In tomato infected with Verticillium dahliae, P. indica increased leaf and fruit biomass and decreased disease severity. Also in tomato, P. indica reduced the concentration of Pepino mosaic virus in shoots (Fakhro et al. 2010).\n9 Piriformospora indica: Endophytic Fungus for Salt Stress Tolerance…\n274\nThe inoculated wheat with P. indica may subsequently reduce the symptoms caused by several fungal pathogens on leaves, stems, and roots that were addressed under greenhouse and field conditions and also indicated by increased hydrogen peroxide formation in leaves challenged with powdery mildew (Desisa 2017). Root colonization by P. indica protects plants against various diseases. These include the root rot pathogens Verticillium, Fusarium foot rot, Rhizoctonia and Thielavopsis, and several fungal diseases of roots and stems, including Alternaria brassicae, Botrytis cinerea, and powdery mildew (Harman and Uphoff 2019). Colonization of P. indica controlled various plant diseases such as powdery mildew, eyespot, Rhizoctonia root rot, Fusarium wilt, black root rot, yellow leaf mosaic, Verticillium wilt, cyst nematode, and leaf blight in barley, wheat, maize, tomato, and Arabidopsis plants. Reduced severity of Verticillium wilt by 30% in tomato caused by Verticillium dahlia, and increased leaf biomass by 20% (Chhipa and Deshmukh 2019).\nP. indica has bio protection performance against the root parasite F. verticillioides in maize and observed stimulated increase in biomass, root length, and root number compared to the plants grown with F. verticillioides alone. The decrease of antioxidant enzyme activities due to the presence of P. indica helped the plant to overcome the disease load of F. verticillioides (Kumar et  al. 2009; Varma et  al. 2013). The effect of P. indica as bio protector on barley was assessed under seminatural conditions using Mitscherlich pots (Waller et al. 2005), under these conditions P. indica acted as both a biofertilizer and a biocontrol agent (Waller et  al. 2005; Varma et al. 2013). P. indica exerts beneficial activity against two major cereal pathogens (F. culmorum and Cochliobolus sativus) that cause enormous worldwide economic losses (Waller et al. 2005). The effect of P. indica against pathogen is based on inhibitory activity by dual bixenic culture technique, volatile metabolites against pathogen, P. indica culture filtrate, and role of lytic enzymes in pathogen inhibition (Varma et al. 2013). Major mechanisms of biological plant disease protection by P. indica are: Competition for occupying niches or nutrients, Production of antibiotics, Induced resistance and mycoparasitism (Desisa 2017). P. indica has also been shown to increase both crop yield and plant defense of a variety of crops (barley, tomato, maize) against root pathogens (Desisa 2017).\n9.8 Applications and Recent Researches in P. indica\nNotably, compared to many other endophytes, P. indica can be cultured very easily in a bioreactor in order to prepare effective biofertilizer formulations (Singh et al. 2003; Oelmüller et al. 2009; Bagde et al. 2010; Qiang et al. 2011). P. indica reduces the harmful impact of stress on photosynthetic concert of the host plants and stabilizes growth and nutrition under salinity, drought, and heat (Baltruschat et al. 2008; Sherameti et al. 2008; Varma et al. 2012b). P. indica induces antioxidant system, the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes, and protein to confer tolerance in different plant species such as Chinese cabbage (Sun et al. 2010), Arabidopsis thaliana (Sherameti et al. 2008), and Hordeum vulgare (Baltruschat et al. 2008; Ansari et al.\nF. A. Abo Nouh et al.\n275\n2014). However, despite all of these described benefits, Franken (2012) states that it may be difficult to place P. indica on the market because (1) the fungus was first isolated in India and is protected by patent in many countries (international publication number—WO 99/29177) making any commercial prospect reliant on the patent owner to manufacturing it or licensing it for manufacture and (2) it sometimes has unexplained negative effects on plant growth.\nThe fungus possesses positive phytopromotional effects due to production/modulation of phytohormone levels (plant bioregulation ability), apart from its role in mobilization and transportation of the plant unavailable phosphorous reserves in soil beyond the depletion zone (P-mobilizer ability) (Gosal et al. 2013). Endophyteenhanced plant growth promotion is another conferred beneficial trait that, at least for the root-colonizing endophyte P. indica, is likely achieved through enhanced nutrient uptake and translocation, and by the modulation of phytohormones involved in growth and development (Johnson et al. 2014; Lugtenberg et al. 2016). P. indica is already reported to be involved in high salt tolerance, disease resistance, and strong growth-promoting activities leading to enhancement of host plant yield (Basu et al. 2016). P. indica inocula are very effective for their commercial applications to various crops within the defined parameters, viz. inocula quantity, inoculation time point, as well as soils election for plant cultivation. Moreover, P. indica root endophyte has been credibly evidenced to minimize the use of chemical fertilizers, control crop yield, and also to provide increased resistance and tolerance in plants against biotic and abiotic stresses (Unnikumar et al. 2013; Gill et al. 2016). The axenic cultivability of P. indica on economically viable synthetic media makes it suitable for mass scale inoculum production for application in agro-forestry and horticulture (Desisa 2017).\nP. indica confers drought stress tolerance to Arabidopsis, and this is associated with the priming of the expression of a quite diverse set of stress-related genes in the leaves. When seedlings are first exposed to drought stress and then transferred to soil, many colonized seedlings reach the flowering stage and produce seeds, while the percentage for uncolonized seedlings is much lower (Desisa 2017). P. indica’s wide host benefits as well as its amenability for fundamental biological studies are attractive properties for research and its potential to transform the productivity of agricultural crops sustainably is exciting. With respect to barley, P. indica interactions have shown enhanced grain yield (Murphy et al. 2014) and at low temperatures with higher nutrient input, P. indica also appeared to trigger flowering earlier and still increase grain yield. These results indicate that P. indica could be developed as an effective crop treatment in low temperature-stressed barley and may have the potential to increase crop yield under colder growing environments on the proviso that adequate nutrients are supplied (Lugtenberg et al. 2016).\nP. indica as a mycofertilizer has produced a greater keenness among mycorrhizologists, due to being easily culturable, plant growth enhancer and inducer. In the present work, the recently discovered root endophytic-fungi P. indica has been optimized and tested for its growth enhancement (Krishnaveni et al. 2014). Considering the recent researches, P. indica is a promising agent for use in organic agriculture to manage nutrient deficiency in calcareous soil (Basu et al. 2016). P. indica is one of\n9 Piriformospora indica: Endophytic Fungus for Salt Stress Tolerance…\n276\nthe most studied fungi for its plant growth promotion activity and stress resistance (Varma et al. 1999; Franken 2012; Kumar et al. 2017). P. indica, a wide host rootcolonizing, has been used as a model to study the mechanisms and evolution of mutualistic symbiosis (Dong et  al. 2013). Nonetheless, a powder formulation of P. indica has been developed under the trade name “ROOTONIC” and is currently deployed in field trials in India (Shrivastava and Varma 2014; Lugtenberg et  al. 2016). Presently, these fungi can be grown with host plants in pot culture containing soil, sand, or expanded clay. They have also been grown by using hydroponics, aeroponics, and root organ culture; all of which are not a cost-effective proposition. P. indica can be propagated on several economically viable synthetic media, potato dextrose media. Fermentation technique should be optimized to device a simple, cheap, and commercially viable technique for the mass scale inoculums production for application in agro-forestry and horticulture (Desisa 2017).\nGeneral characteristics of P. indica according to Krishnaveni et al. (2014); Gill et al. (2016); Desisa (2017).\n• Increase the potential of plants and their essential ingredients. • Applicable in agriculture, floriculture, viticulture, and reclamation of degraded\nand heavily mined soils. • Used in form of culture filtrate for development and formulation into\nbiofertilizer. • Acts as biofertilizer, bioprotector, immune regulator, and agent for biological\nhardening of tissue cultured plants. • Mediates nutrient uptake, pathogenic inhibitor, stimulates growth and seed\nproduction. • Confers resistance to toxins, resistance to heavy metal ions, promotes salt stress\nand other abiotic stress."

It is conceivable that the primary interest of the heterotrophic fungus is to gain access to photoassimilates. This is also obvious for P. indica, which was originally identified in a desert, where survival is dependent on an efficient association with roots due to the limitations of C compounds in the soil. The beneficial effects for the plant are at least in part caused by a better nutrient supply by the fungal hyphae. Many studies show that symbiosis of plants with endophytic-fungi could be a good solution for reducing the effects of salinity. P. indica possesses the phytopromotional to biocontrol properties, imparts stress tolerance to abiotic as well as biotic factors, and also exhibits enhanced nutritional availability to the inoculated plant. It has enormous application potentials for the biotization of the micro-propagated plants\nF. A.

They are also responsible for invasion of secondary pests and pathogens by causing wounds in the host roots (Caboni et al. 2016). Global annual yield losses from plant parasitic nematodes have been estimated at 12.6% ($215.77 billion) for top 20 life sustaining crops (Abd-Elgawad and Askary 2015). Among different groups of plant parasitic nematodes, root knot (Meloidogyne spp.) and cyst nematodes (Heterodera and Globodera spp.) are economically important by forming complex feeding structures like giant cells and\nK.

Apart from these, root-lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.), burrowing nematode (Radopholus similis), stem nematode (Ditylenchus dipsaci), reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis), and several other plant parasitic nematodes causing economic damage to the crops (Jones et al. 2013).\nMany traditional chemical pesticides such as fumigants, organophosphates, and carbamates have been used for the management of plant parasitic nematodes (Kour et al. 2020). However, the usage of harmful chemical pesticides cause environmental toxicity, health effects and further withdrawal of some pesticides has led to the development and adoption of non-chemical alternatives for the management of plant parasitic nematodes (Davies and Curtis 2011; Kumar et al. 2018). In addition, these chemicals do not affect the development of nematode eggs in soil, since the egg shell of nematode acts as a barrier which makes them resistant to chemical pesticides (Baron et al. 2019). Crop rotation and use of resistant cultivars have been used as the management strategies for plant parasitic nematodes. However, these practices are limited by the size of growing area, wide host range of nematode species, and high genetic diversity among or within nematode populations (Berlitz et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015).\nBiological control, an alternative for the management of plant parasitic nematodes. The usage of biocontrol agents is increasing these days, due to their reduced environmental toxicity, target specificity, and safety to non-target organisms (Kumar and Singh 2015; Jiang et al. 2017). These biocontrol agents include fungi, bacteria, viruses, nematodes, and other invertebrates which have an antagonistic activity against plant parasitic nematodes. The market for biological nematicides has risen by nearly 20% from 2009 to the present, according to the Markets and Markets report, with most of the development in field crops. Nematicide sales amounted to just over $1 billion in 2014 and are anticipated to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.7% over the next 10 years to $1.3 billion over 20 years (Jiang et al. 2017).\nCurrently several biocontrol agents such as fungi and bacteria have been widely used as commercial products for the management of plant parasitic nematodes. Fungal antagonists have been considered as the most promising biocontrol agents and attention is being paid to the exploitation of fungi to control plant parasitic nematodes (Stirling 2011; Moosavi and Zare 2012; Lamovsek et al. 2013). Among different fungal biocontrol agents, the most widely studied species for nematode management include Pochonia chlamydosporia, Purpureocillium lilacinum, Arthrobotrys oligospora, Trichoderma spp. and Verticillium spp. (Rastegari et al. 2020a, b; Yadav et al. 2020a, b).

The type of trapping structure formed mainly depends on the fungal species or strains of fungal species and both biotic and abiotic environmental factors (Nordbring-Hertz et al. 2006). Based on phylogenetic analysis results using ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and protein coding genes, these trapping devices could serve as indicators for generic delimitation among these fungi (Ahren et al. 1998; Scholler et al. 1999; Li et al. 2005). There are about 380 species of nematode trapping fungi have been reported from different regions of the world (Zhang et al. 2011). They are usually non-host specific and can infect all soil dwelling nematodes. All the known nematode trapping fungi belong to the order Orbiliales of the phylum Ascomycota (Zhang and Hyde 2014). These fungi can live both saprophytically on organic matter and as predatory by capturing tiny animals. However, they can shift from saprophytic to predatory lifestyle in the presence of nematode prey by the production of trapping structures (Li et al. 2011; Yang et al. 2012; Zhang and Hyde 2014).

The pressure exerted by nematode on the ring during this process causes the activation of G-protein coupled receptors which leads to an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+, and activation of calmodulin that opens the water channels, and thereby inflates the ring trapping the nematode (Chen et  al. 2001).

This study also indicated that protein kinase C (PKC) signal pathway and Zn (2)-C6 type transcription factors were responsible for trap formation in D. stenobrocha (Liu et  al. 2014).

The specificity of this fungus towards sedentary endoparasitic nematodes is associated with the recognition of both quantitative and qualitative changes in root exudates patterns during nematode infection (Wang and Bergeson 1974). Crops such as beans, cabbage, crotalaria, kale, pigeon pea, potato, pumpkin, and tomato are considered as good hosts (200 CFU/cm2 of root) for colonization of this fungus in the rhizosphere. Whereas, chilli, sweet potato, cowpea, rye, tobacco, and cotton are considered as moderate hosts (100–200 CFU/cm2 of root) and poor hosts (<100 CFU/cm2 of root) include aubergine, okra, soybean, sorghum, and wheat (de Leij 1992; Bourne et al. 1996).\nP. chlamydosporia infects nematode eggs through the development of appressoria at the hyphal tip and the presence of mucilaginous material between appressoria and surface of the egg shell appear to assist in egg shell penetration (Lopez-Llorca et al. 2002). A post infection bulb leads to the development of a mycelium within the egg and destruction of internal contents (Segers 1996; Kerry and Hirsch 2011). The fungus produce extracellular enzymes such as Serine proteases (VCP1) and chitinases which are involved in degradation of egg shells (Segers 1996). SCP1, a serine carboxypeptidase from P. chlamydosporia was immunolocalized in M. javanica eggs infected by fungus (Escudero et al. 2016).\nK. K. Kumar\n293\nThe ability to produce chlamydospores in  vitro without the addition of other energy sources lead to the consideration of this fungus as biocontrol agent. Hence application of chlamydospores at the rate of 5000 spores/g soil in aqueous suspension is recommended to test the efficacy of fungus but it may vary according to the strain and target nematode (de Leij et al. 1992; Stirling and Smith 1998; Bourne and Kerry 2000; Kerry and Hidalgo-Diaz 2004). Application of organic amendments may increase fungal abundance in soil and fungus remains in saprophytic phase but not necessarily increase in nematode parasitic activity (Atkins et al. 2003). Gene expression studies showed differences among several genes involved in cellular signals, transport or DNA repair, with a distinct cluster of genes commonly expressed during transition from saprophytic to parasitic phase of this fungus (Rosso et al. 2011). Niu (2017) reviewed that the secondary metabolites released from P. chlamydosporia and other species such as resorcylic acid lactone, pyranones, alkaloid, phenolics, etc. may act as virulence factors to plant and animal-parasitic nematodes parasitized by the fungus.\n10.2.3.2 Purpureocillium lilacinum (=Paecilomyces lilacinus)\nP. lilacinum is a soil inhabiting fungus reported from different parts of the world and widely used as potential biocontrol agent against plant parasitic nematodes (Vasanthi and Kumaraswamy 1999; Brand et al. 2010). This fungus infects eggs, egg masses, females, and cysts of many plant parasitic nematodes such as Meloidogyne spp., Globodera spp., Heterodera spp., Tylenchulus sp., and Nacobbus sp. The fungus first colonizes gelatinous matrix of different nematodes and penetrate the eggs with the help of appressoria or hyphae. In addition, the fungus produce several extracellular enzymes such as serine proteases, chitinases depending on the recognition of the host surface hydrophobicity and these were purified and characterized from different strains (Bonants et  al. 1995; Lopez-Llorca et  al. 2002; Khan et  al. 2003; Huang et al. 2004; Khan et al. 2004). Enzymes produced by P. lilacinum strain 251 resulted in reduction of egg hatching in M. javanica (Khan et al. 2004). Similarly, the secondary metabolites produced by the fungi (Australian isolate), such as leucinostatins, have significant effect on the colonization of M. javanica eggs (Park et al. 2004).\nIn addition to control of plant parasitic nematodes, species of this fungus produce several metabolites which promote plant growth and defensive substances against biotic and abiotic stresses (Khan et al. 2012). Further, this fungus promote plant growth by performing Phosphorus solubilization in soil (Rinu and Pandey 2011; Lima-Rivera et al. 2016).\n10 Fungi: A Bio-resource for the Control of Plant Parasitic Nematodes\n294"

So far more than 200 compounds have been identified from nearly 280 fungal species (Li et al. 2007a; Li and Zhang 2014).

Trichoderma parasitizes nematode eggs by the secretion of chitinolytic enzymes encoded by two genes chi 18-5 and chi 18-12 (Szabó et al. 2012). In addition, trypsin like protease (PRA1) and serine protease (SprT) were also observed against Meloidogyne juveniles during infection by the fungi (Suarez et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2009). Further, Szabó et al. 2013 reported that comparative analysis of protease expression profiles in T. harzianum revealed 13 peptidase encoding genes, suggesting that these genes might play an important role in infection process by the fungi. In addition to direct antagonism, nematophagous activity has also observed on eggs of M. incognita, M. javanica, M. arenaria, and M. exigua (Windham et al. 1989; Eapen et al. 2005; Sharon et al. 2007; Spiegel et al. 2007; Ferreira et al. 2008).\nK.

There are several fungal parasites like Coniothyrium minitans which attack plant pathogen like sclerotia, while Pythium oligandrum attack living hyphae belonging to Botrytis, Fusarium, and Phytophthora. Single fungal pathogen “can be attacked by multiple hyperparasites, for example, Acremonium alternatum, Acrodontium crateriforme, Ampelomyces quisqualis, Cladosporium oxysporum, and Gliocladium virens have the capacity to parasitize powdery mildew pathogens” (Kiss 2003)."

      "text" : "Antibiosis is the “procedure of secretion of antimicrobial compounds by fungi to suppress or kill pathogenic fungi in the vicinity of its growth area. Most fungi are capable of secreting one or more compounds. The secondary metabolites with the antibiotic activity are often correlated to specific stages of morphological differentiation, and are associated with the phase of active growth. Interestingly, some fungal secondary metabolites can modify the growth and the metabolism of plants, while others seem to target specific fungal processes such as sporulation and hyphal elongation. Thus, the expression of secondary metabolites may occur at a predictable point during the normal life cycle of some fungi, including those used for agriculture applications” (Keller et al. 2005). Menendez and Godeas (1998) reported “a biocontrol study of Trichoderma harzianum against Sclerotinias clerotiorum—a soil borne plant pathogen attacking many economically important crops, such as soybean”. Menendez and Godeas (1998) studied “about antibiosis of T. harzianum against the plant pathogen and assumed that the beneficial effect was due to concurrent mycoparasitism and competition” (Inbar et  al. 1996; Ghisalberti 2002). In another example, despite close contact between hyphae of Trichoderma spp. and Fusarium moniliforme/Aspergillus flavus on coculturing, hyphal penetration was absent. This suggested that mycoparasitism was not the sole cause for the observed inhibitory effects (Calistru et  al. 1997). Therefore, metabolites produced by Trichoderma spp. (e.g., volatiles, extracellular enzymes, and/or antibiotics) were considered to be the probable elements involved in antibiosis.\nTrichoderma spp. has been effective against a wide host range and in hindering the longevity of sclerotia of pathogenic fungi. Szekeres et al. (2005) reviewed about “antagonistic metabolites produced by Trichoderma spp. The metabolites are linear, amphipathic polypeptides, namely peptaibols and peptaibiotics. The physico-chemical and biological properties of these antibiotic compounds included disruption of lipid membranes, antimicrobial activities, and induction of plant resistance. Some biocontrol agents exhibit predatory behavior under nutrient-limited conditions. However, such activity generally is not expressed under typical growing conditions. For example, some species of Trichoderma produce a range of enzymes that are\nV. Yadav et al.\n321\ndirected against cell walls of fungi. Peptaibols and the related peptaibiotics are linear, amphipathic polypeptides and the compounds are composed of 5–20 amino acids. These are generally produced in microheterogeneous mixtures that have strong antimicrobial activity”. Gram-positive bacteria and fungi act synergistically with cell-wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens and elicit plant resistance to pathogens (Wiest et  al. 2002; Szekeres et  al. 2005). Peptaibols and peptaibiotics with unusual amino acid content are the result of non-ribosomal biosynthesis.\nLarge multifunctional enzymes known as peptide synthetases assemble these molecules by the multiple carrier thio-template mechanism from a remarkable range of precursors, which can be N-methylated, acylated, or reduced (Szekeres et  al. 2005). Peptaibols and peptaibiotics show interesting physico-chemical and biological properties including the formation of pores in bilayer lipid membranes. In tobacco plants, exogenous applications of peptaibols trigger a defense response and reduce susceptibility to tobacco mosaic virus (Wiest et al. 2002). A peptaibol synthetase from T. virens has been purified, and the corresponding gene, when cloned, will facilitate studies of this compound and its contribution to biocontrol. An extensive review on antibiosis and production of Trichoderma secondary metabolites elaborated the significance of secondary metabolites (antibiotic activity) in antagonistic action of Trichoderma spp. against pathogenic fungi Pythium ultimum and Rhizoctonia solani (Hutchinson 1999; Hanson and Howell 2002). However, there seems to be a general consent on the combined synergistic effect of the two factors (enzymes and antibiotic compounds) (Schirmbock et al. 1994)."

      "text" : "Starvation is the most “common cause of death for microorganisms, so that competition for limiting nutrients results in biological control of fungal phytopathogens” (Chet et al. 1997). Celar (2003) directed a study on the forms of nutrients mostly available to phytopathogenic and antagonistic fungi. Earlier study reconfirmed the findings of Blakeman (1978) that shortage of easily accessible nutrients for microorganisms, especially of those living in soil and on plant surfaces, results in open nutrient competition among microorganisms (Sivan and Chet 1986; Lewis and Papavizas 1991). Biocontrol based on competition for rare but essential micronutrients, such as iron, which is extremely limited in the rhizosphere, depending on soil pH has been observed. In highly oxidized and aerated soil, iron is present in ferric form (Lindsay 1979), which is insoluble in water (pH 7.4) and the concentration may be as low as 10–18 M. This concentration is too low to support the growth of microorganisms, which generally need concentrations approaching 10–6 M. To survive in such an environment, organisms were found to secrete iron-binding ligands called siderophores having high affinity to sequester iron from the micro-environment. Largely most filamentous fungi uptake iron as essential mineral for viability and under iron starvation, and mostly fungi excrete low-molecular-weight ferric-\n11 Global Scenario of Advance Fungal Research in Crop Protection\n322\niron specific chelators, termed siderophores, to mobilize environmental iron (Eisendle et al. 2004).\nThen, iron from the ferri-siderophore complexes is recovered via specific uptake mechanisms. In Aspergillus fumigates and Aspergillus nidulans, siderophore biosynthesis is negatively regulated by carbon source (Eisendle et al. 2004). In Ustilago maydis, gene products related to iron uptake affect the development of plant (McIntyre et al. 2004). Some Trichoderma and biocontrol agents produce highly efficient siderophores that chelate iron and stop the growth of other fungi (Chet and Inbar 1994). For this reason, soil composition influences the biocontrol effectiveness of Pythium by Trichoderma according to iron availability. In addition, T. harzianum T35 controls Fusarium oxysporum by competing for both rhizosphere colonization and nutrients, with biocontrol becoming more effective as the nutrient concentration decreases (Tjamos 1992). Competition has proved to be particularly important for the biocontrol of phytopathogens such as Botrytis cinerea, the main pathogenic. The increased efficiency in iron uptake of the commensal microorganisms is thought to be a contributing factor to their ability to aggressively colonize plant roots and an aid to the displacement of the deleterious organisms from potential sites of infection. Thus, the cited examples confirm the significance of competition for nutrients during biocontro."

Beauveria bassiana is a filamentous entomopathogenic fungus which is highly adapted to specific insect hosts. This fungus naturally grows in soil and is a well-known pathogen on insects that causes white muscardine disease (Sandhu et al. 2001; Thakur et al. 2005; Jain et al. 2008). Paecilomyces fumosoroseus is a both nematophagous and entomopathogenic fungus, which kills harmful nematodes and insects by pathogenesis and causes disease in them. This fungus is used as a bionematicide for controlling nematodes by applying it directly to the soil. P. lilacinus infects and ingests the eggs of root-knot and even cyst nematodes. Hyphomycetes are the natural enemies of whiteflies worldwide and cause “Yellow Muscardine” disease (Nunez et  al. 2008). Usually, certain species of fungi are known for their competence causing high level mortality, and developing natural epizootics that is dependent on the environmental conditions and also biased by various practices of crop production. P. lilacinus is known for its potential as biological control agent specifically in subtropical and tropical soils. P. lilacinus has the ability to grow on leaf surface in humid conditions and it is known to spread rapidly in whitefly populations (Wraight et al. 2000).\nNomuraea rileyi is dimorphic hyphomycetous fungi that cause epizootic on numerous insects and arthropods and thus it is a very efficient biocontrol agent against insects and arthropods. It is known that many insect species that belong to\nV. Yadav et al.\n323\nLepidoptera including Spodoptera litura and some to Coleoptera are very susceptible to N. rileyi. The host specificity and the eco-friendly nature of N. rileyi fortify its use in insect pest management. On the other hand, its mode of infection and development is examined and reported for numerous insect hosts (for instance, Trichoplusia ni, Heliothis zea, Plathypena scabra, Bombyx mori, Pseudoplusia). In another example, insect Spilosoma was found to be severely attacked by N. rileyi (Mathew et al. 1998). Metarhizium anisopliae is a pathogen for insect pests and is very well known for biological control of notorious insect pests (Sandhu et al. 1993; Sandhu and Mishra 1994). This species is specifically used for the control of locusts, grasshoppers, cockroaches, termites, and other major pests worldwide. Oil is used for spreading the green spores to the parts of the insect with high relative humidity (parts like the back of the neck or under the wing where cuticle is thin) where the fungus can grow easily. This fungus is very effective; it holds the capability to kill 90% of locusts with its application in 7–21  days, depending on the number of infected spores. Complete biological activity of M. anisopliae is tested on Eutectona machaeralis (teak skeletonizer) and is analyzed to be a potential fungal biological control agent of teak pest (Sandhu et al. 2000).\nVerticillium lecanii is widely distributed entomopathogenic fungus that causes large epizootic in warm and humid environments (Nunez et  al. 2008, Kim et  al. 2002). It is known to be a very effective agent of biological control against Trialeurodes vaporariorum in South Korean greenhouses. In the year 1970, V. lecanii was developed for controlling whitefly and several aphids species including green peach aphids for use in greenhouse Chrysanthemums (Hamlen 1979). It is considered to be major parasite and can cause massive fall in cereal-cyst nematode populations (Kerry et al. 1982). Another species V. chlamydosporium has an extensive host range among cyst and root-knot nematodes. It is not much consistent and only few isolates have potential as commercial biological control agents. Species of Trichoderma are used in biological control of pests and soil borne pathogens, and as PGPR. This mechanism of biological control has led to improvement in application of the different strains as biocontrol agents. These are developed into commercial products of biocontrol that are used in the fields, greenhouse systems (Harman et al. 2004), and also well known for controlling various soil borne diseases. The soil borne diseases known are “Pythium ultimum Trow. (Naseby et al. 2000), Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary (Inbar et al. 1996) and Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend (Sivan and Chet 1993)” Trichoderma spp. easily extracts nutrients from complex substrates (e.g. protein, glucosamine, and tannin) in the soil. Trichoderma viride mediated reprogramming of plant defense mechanism in Vigna mungo, Cajanus cajan, Vigna radiata, was  reported against plant pathogens Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria alternata (Surekha et al. 2013, 2014; Rao et al. 2015).

Fungi are dignified biological agents with diverse benefits such as they are self-generating either on the surface of plants or inside them which efficiently provide protection constantly and are absolutely safe to use. Fungi are easy to produce and also quite adaptable with current application technology. Additionally, vast usage of fungi can lead in control of numerous pests with a single product. There are certain limitations with biocontrol fungi like narrow host range of the beneficial organisms, and increase in mortality rate with age of biocontrol fungi. Environmental factors play a huge role in their success, for example, biocontrol to be effective, moist/humid weather is necessary. The above-mentioned major reasons limit their usage in pest control (Yadav et al. 2020b, e)."

Sanger sequencing follows the chain termination method, i.e. dideoxynucleotide method (Sanger et al. 1977). Sanger sequencing uses oligonucleotide primers to find certain specific regions of DNA.  The process is initiated with denaturation of double stranded to single stranded DNA which forms the template for the process of sequencing. The resultant single strand is then annealed with oligonucleotide primers. Later, elongated in\n11 Global Scenario of Advance Fungal Research in Crop Protection\n326\nthe mixture of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) that provides the nucleotides (A,T,G,C) to build new double stranded model. Along with these a few chain terminating dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) of each nucleotide are added, which help in termination of the strand. Each strand will be varying in their length depending on the ddNTPs attaching. Each ddNTP is associated with a fluorescent marker, when attached to the sequence will emit and illuminate light depending on the nucleotide base. According to the protocol each nucleotide is associated with specific color fluorescence, namely A by green, T by red, G by black, and C by blue. And then a laser depicts the sequence depending on the intensity color of light emitted and which is translated into peak. If a heterozygous variant is present in the sequence, peak will be captured by two fluorescent dyes and the dye color is replaced by completely new base pair’s color. The types of variants include silent, missense, nonsense, truncating, deletion, insertion, and splicing. Sanger sequencing is the robust testing strategy that has the capability to diagnose point mutation/ deletion or duplication. It is definitely a promising approach to cover desired regions but is costly for multiplex testing systems. Therefore, the latest Sanger sequencing approach is gene specific (Masoudi-Nejad et  al. 2013; El-Metwally et al. 2014).\nMaxam–Gilbert sequencing is another method that belongs to the first generation of sequencing which was developed in the year 1976–1977 by Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert. It is well known as chemical degradation/chemical cleavage method for DNA sequence determination. The method depends on nucleotide cleaving and is most efficient with small nucleotide polymers. This method permits sequencing of at least 100 bases from the point of labelling (Maxam and Gilbert 1977). In accordance to this method, the sequence of the nucleotides is determined by terminally labelled DNA molecule by breaking it at any of the bases (ATGC) with the aid of chemical agents (Shackelford 2019). It is gel based sequencing method which uses four different base specific enzymes known as restriction endonucleases for cleaving at specific sequence. Postpurification, phosphate from 3′ end is cleaved with the help of phosphatase and replaced with radioactive phosphate 32P. Then the radioactive DNA fragment is treated with restriction endonucleases and the resultant DNA fragments are ran through gel electrophoresis to separate labelled and unlabelled end subfragments. And the fragment is purified whose sequence needs to be identified from its other end labelled subfragment. Four base specific samples are prepared and the end labelled DNA fragment is divided further and placed in these chemical solutions. Each solution treats a particular base and the bond of that specific base is broken and the base is removed. Electrophoresis is performed for the DNA fragments in the four reaction samples, and by autoradiography, the bands of DNA fragments are revealed according to their length in each individual lane. The sequence is read depending on the density of bands. The dark band in each reaction depicts the base present in position. Maxam–Gilbert method was more popular when compared to Sanger, but was not preferred because of its technical complexity and extensive usage of hazardous radioactive chemicals (Mahboob 2010).\nV.

      "text" : "The first generation sequencing technologies remained prominent for almost three decades, specifically Sanger sequencing. However, cost and time were the major drawbacks that have led to development of second generation sequencing technologies which are based on two approaches, namely sequencing by ligation and sequencing by synthesis. The basic characteristics of the second generation of sequencing are (1) generation of millions of short reads in parallel, (2) speeding up the process of sequencing when compared to first generation, and (3) detection of sequencing output directly without electrophoresis. The second generation sequencing technologies include Roche/454 sequencing, Ion torrent sequencing, Illumina/ Solexa sequencing, and ABI/SOLiD sequencing.\nRoche/454 sequencing was introduced in the market in the year 2005 and uses pyrosequencing technique which follows sequencing by synthesis method and detects pyrophosphate released after each nucleotide is incorporated in the new synthetic DNA. Each of the randomly fragmented DNA samples is attached to a bead which carries primers carrying oligonucleotides complementary to the DNA fragment. Each fragment is associated with a single bead and each bead is isolated, amplified using PCR producing a million copies of each fragment. The beads are now transferred onto a plate of wells which undergoes a series of reactions producing light at addition of each nucleotide that in turn deduce the sequence of DNA fragments. It has the capability to generate long reads which are easier to map a reference genome (Mardis 2008)\nIon torrent semiconductor sequencing technology was bought into market by Life Technologies in the year 2010. It is similar to 454 pyrosequencing, except that it does not use fluorescent labelled nucleotides. It is particularly based on hydrogen ion detection that is released during the process of sequencing. It uses microwell containing chip that has bead with several identical fragments. The change in pH while incorporating each nucleotide with fragment in the pearl is detected by the sensor and converted into a voltage signal that is proportional to the number of nucleotides incorporated. This method holds the capability to produce read of 200–600 base pairs. The major benefit of this technology is longer read length and speed of sequencing. The disadvantage on the other hand is difficulty in interpreting homopolymer sequences that cause indel errors (Rothberg et al. 2011).\nIllumina/Solexa sequencing by synthesis approach is developed by Solexa which was acquired by Illumina and commercialized the sequencer Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer (GA) (Shendure and Ji 2008; Balasubramanian 2015). The DNA samples are fragmented and adapters ligated to either ends. These adapters are fixed to respective complementary adapters, then hooked on a slide with number of variants on a solid plate. Then each sequence attached to the solid plate is amplified by PCR bridge amplification creating several identical copies of sequences that are known as cluster and each cluster contains almost a million copies of the original sequence. Then sequence of nucleotide is determined via sequencing by synthesis approach of Illumina. This approach employs reversible terminators, add primers,\n11 Global Scenario of Advance Fungal Research in Crop Protection\n328\nmodified nucleotides along with DNA polymerase. The modified nucleotide sequence helps in extending primers by polymerases. Each nucleotide is labelled with a fluorescent so that each one is unique and has one 3′-hydroxyl group assuring addition of a single nucleotide. Clusters are excited by lasers for emitting a signal that is unique for each nucleotide. The signal is then detected by a coupled-charge device (CCD) camera which is in turn translated by certain computer programs. Initially, it produces very short reads of 35 bp and they had the advantage in which they could produce paired end (PE) short reads. The sequence of both ends of each DNA cluster is recorded. However, the latest version is capable of sequencing more than 600 Gbp and short read length is about 125 bp (Reuter et al. 2015; Heo 2015).\nABI/SOLiD sequencing is incorporated in market by Life Technologies which was later taken over by Applied Biosystems (ABI) in the year 2007. Supported Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection (SOLiD) developed sequencing technique following the Sequencing By Ligation (SBL) approach which supports oligonucleotide ligation and detection. This process consists of multiple sequencing rounds which starts by attaching adapters to the DNA fragment, fix on beads, and then clone by PCR emulsion. Then the beads are placed on glass slide consisting of 8-mer with fluorescent label at the end of the fragment and the emitted color is recorded (Alic et al. 2016; Goodwin et al. 2016)."

These advanced methodologies produce long reads in kilobases resolving the assembly problem and repetitive regions of complex genome. The two major approaches in third generation sequencing are Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing approach and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing approach. SMRT was developed by Pacific Biosciences and uses same fluorescent labelling as other technologies, but instead of executing cycles of amplification nucleotide, it detects signals in real time. Pacific biosciences sequencing platforms have a high error rate about 13% dominated by insertions and deletion errors. These errors are randomly distributed along the long read (Kchouk et al. 2017).\nOxford Nanopore Technology sequencing (ONT) was developed for determining the order of nucleotides in a DNA. MinION, the device that promised generation of long reads and enhanced resolution of structural genomic variants, was released by Oxford Nanopore Technologies in the year 2014 (Mikheyev and Tin 2014; Laehnemann et al. 2015). It is a small 4 in device that can be connected to a system (Laver et al. 2015). In this technique the initial DNA strand is linked to its complementary strand by a hairpin. A protein nanopore is used to pass the DNA fragment (Heo 2015). With the action of motor protein DNA fragment is translated through the pore generating ionic current variations that are caused by differences in moving\nV.

In this the direct strand is sequenced to generate “template read” followed by hairpin and then the inverse strand that generates “complement read,” the resulting consensus sequence is the “two direction read (2D)” (Jain et al. 2016; Lu et al. 2016). Low cost, small sizes are the major advantages of this technique over the rest. Also, the sequenced data is displayed on the screen for the sample loaded which is easy to read and reduces delay. MinION is capable of obtaining very long reads of more than 150 kbps, however, has a pretty high error rate ~12% (Ip et al. 2015). This technology has evolved and another device “PrometION” was released which is a sequencer with 48 individual flow cells and each one with 3000 pores that operates at 500 bp/s.

It holds the capability to sequence the entire human genome in less than $1000 and at the same time is very quick and reliable. DNA that is the blueprint of life is the molecule that encodes genetic instructions. The other technologies require sample preparation and complex data processing algorithms resulting in low throughput, short read lengths, and high cost. The advantage of this technology over other generations is it is label-free; highthroughput generating ultra-long reads with minimum requirement of materials. This technology originated from Coulter counter and ion channels and the external voltage is applied and the particles that are smaller than pore are passed through. These pores are either made of solid state film or embedded in biological membrane which separates the reservoir with cis and trans compartments consisting of conductive electrolytes. Electrodes are immersed in each chamber and biased voltage is passed which results in electrolyte ions in the solution to pass through the pores electrophoretically resulting in ionic current signal. The pore is blocked by an analyte and the negatively charged cis DNA is added to the chamber blocking the current flowing through the chamber. The properties (physical and chemical) can be statistically calculated by analyzing duration and amplitude of current blockades with these translocation events. Nanopore technology can be broadly classified into two categories: biological nanopore technology and solid state nanopore technology.\nBiological nanopores are the transmembrane protein channels that are usually inserted in the substrate (bilipid layer, polymer films, or liposomes). The major advantages with biological nanopore are reproducibility, size and structure along with the ability of modifying in combination with molecular biology techniques. The common biological nanopores include α-Hemolysin, MspA (for reading info from 4 nucleotides simultaneously), Bacteriophage phi29, and Oxford Nanopore\n11 Global Scenario of Advance Fungal Research in Crop Protection\n330\nTechnologies (ONT). α-Hemolysin also known as α-toxin is the most common biological nanopore, and it is an exotoxin secreted by a human pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The inner diameter of α-HL and size of ss-DNA are pretty close in size that aids in identifying the identifying nucleotides using ionic current in the nanopore making it a promising tool for the molecular interaction analyses. The only limitation is its limited pore size restricting it to the analysis of ss DNA or RNA or small molecules or length of β-barrel which is very long to distinguish each nucleotide in long chain DNA.\nSolid state nanopore are nano-sized holes formed from drilling the opening in a solid substrate (Dekker 2007; Storm et al. 2003). These are specifically used in the study of molecular translocation. Growth in microfabrication technologies has gained more attention towards solid state nanopore. The advantage over biological nanopore is its thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability; along with size adjustability (Cheley et al. 2002; Abiola et al. 2003; Venkatesan et al. 2009), additionally they can even work under various experimental conditions and can be produced in bulk. Over the past few years the method is also applied in multiple fields such as DNA sequencing, protein detection, and disease diagnosis (Traversi et al. 2013). Some of the major examples of solid state nanopore include: Si3N4 and SiO2 nanopores (widely used a substrate because of their high chemical stability and low mechanical stress) (Kim et al. 2007), Al2O3 membranes (have improved electrical performance, low noise in DNA translocation, and higher signal-to-noise ratio (Feng et  al. 2015), over single layer membranes, hybrid biological/solid state nanopore."

      "text" : "This section will discuss in detail on genome sequencing projects like 1000 Fungal Genomes Project, and Ensembl Fungi. Fungi are the largest branch of tree of life with almost 1.5 million species. Their impact on human affairs and the ecosystem is enormous because of their diverse activities as pathogens, symbiont, and decomposers (Grigoriev et al. 2014). They form the most essential components of the carbon cycle and all of these together have the ability to degrade almost any polymer. Joint Genome Institute (JGI) of the Department of Energy has initiated a 5 year project for sequencing thousand fungal genomes. JGI Genome Portal is available at http://1000.fungalgenomes.org/home/. The objective of the project is to address gaps in the fungal tree of life by sequencing at least two reference genomes from around five hundred recognized families of fungi. The aim of the project is to provide genomic information for each family of fungi. Precise understanding of how fungi interact in natural and synthetic communities is crucial for the use of it and for the progress of humankind. The possibility to sample environments for complex fungal metagenomes is in place and it will be a major help in harnessing fungi for industrial, energy, and climate management tasks.\nThe accurate analysis of the data depends on characterization of fungi with reference to data of fungal genomes. The purpose of analyzing the data is to work on\n11 Global Scenario of Advance Fungal Research in Crop Protection\n332\nphylogenetic and comparative genomics data to understand evolution and biology of fungi at the most (Grigoriev et al. 2014). The large-scale genomics initiatives like the 1000 Fungal Genomes Project augmented data requirements and new approaches for data integration and analysis. An integrated fungal genomics resource MycoCosm was designed which allowed researchers to access and analyze large amounts of genomic data using web-based analytical tools. MycoCosm portal enables efficient comparative genomics of fungi and in-depth multidimensional analysis of individual genomes, which may be applied to phylogenetically related fungi or to those sharing the same lifestyle, ecological niche, or phenotypic trait. The efficient tools enable comparisons between the groups of genomes, providing an opportunity to create wealth of genomes in MycoCosm. Tools integrate single genomes into a comparative context and have the ability to visualize variations in gene counts in different GO, KEGG, and KOG categories across a user-selected assortment of genomes comprised in MycoCosm. MycoCosm also includes predefined groups of fungi to enable users to ask questions for fungal genomes in a group context. Two types of genome groups are available in MycoCosm (1) PhyloGroups, consisting of phylogenetically related species (corresponding to the nodes of the MycoCosm tree) and (2) EcoGroups, containing fungi of similar lifestyle or ecology (but which may be phylogenetically distant) (Grigoriev et al. 2014).\nEnsembl Fungi is a browser for fungal genomes and is developed by EMBL-EBI for analysis and visualization of genomic data. Most of the fungal genome data retrieved are taken from the databases of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (European Nucleotide Archive at the EBI, GenBank at the NCBI, and DNA Database of Japan) and integrated into Ensembl Fungi. In some cases, the annotation has been directly retrieved from the websites of the data generators. Data can be visualized through the Ensembl genome browser and accessed at http://fungi.ensembl.org/index.html."

The proteins were identified by searching against C. militaris genome database using Mascot program after in-gel trypsindigested peptides were subjected to  nESI-LC-MS/MS.  This information can be used in identifying or extrapolating proteins related to different development stages in biocontrol fungi. Nearly 261 proteins responsible for mycelium stage, 116 proteins responsible for fruiting body stage, and 98 proteins responsible for both stages were observed during expression. Glycoside hydrolases are among the recognized protein which catalyze the hydrolysis of the glycoside linkage and release smaller sugars and play significant role in biomass degradation by some fungi (Martinez et al. 2008). Heat shock proteins were required for protecting the cells against stress conditions to the maximum in host–pathogen interactions (Largeteau et al. 2010). Enolase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, and tansketolase are involved in the processes of sugar metabolism playing a crucial in both the development stages. This information can be used in identifying or extrapolating proteins related to glycoside hydrolases, heat shock proteins, enolase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, and tansketolase in other biocontrol fungi."

The combination of these EPNs and the control agents have proved to be synergistic and produce higher mortality compared to the individual agents (Koppenhofer and Kaya 1997). The synergisms of EPNs and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid were also reported (Koppenhofer and Kaya 1998; Koppenhofer et al. 2000b; Polavarapu et al. 2007).

This type of induction is divided into two major categories: Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) and Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR). SAR is the SA-dependent process and is induced by treatment with a variety of agents or chemicals (e.g. Acibenzolar-S-methyl, ASM). On the other side, ISR is mediated by ET and JA sensitive pathways that can be induced in plants by the application of a variety of abiotic or biotic agents (Spoel and Dong 2012). These biotic or abiotic agents include strains of Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) (Van Loon et al. 1998). These antagonistic and resistance inducing bacteria can be good candidates for formulating new inoculants for biological control of plant disease (Beneduzi et al. 2012).

N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinoline, and autoinducer-2 are the well-known signalling molecules, which are used by microbes for communication (Challa et  al. 2018, 2019b; Challa and Neelapu 2018a; Mohana Sheela et al. 2018; Neelapu et al. 2018). AHLs in Proteobacteria, gamma-butyrolactones in Streptomyces, cis-11-methyl-2-dodecanoic acid in Xanthomonas, and oligopeptides in gram-positive microorganisms act as signalling molecules (Danhorn and Fuqua 2007). The three types of communication systems used by the plant microbiome are intraspecies communication system, interspecies communication systems, and interkingdom communication system; as the microbiome is made up of multiple microbial species in the plant habitat (Mohana Sheela et al. 2018). Intraspecies communication system enables effective communication among the same species of microbes in the microbiome. This allows detecting cell densities of the same species of microbes in the microbiome, to synchronize and\n11 Global Scenario of Advance Fungal Research in Crop Protection\n336\ncontrol several cellular and physiological processes (Mohana Sheela et al. 2018). Interspecies communication system enables effective communication between different species of microbes in the microbiome. This allows detecting cell densities of different species of microbes in the microbiome to control global gene expression in the microbiome (Mohana Sheela et al. 2018). Interkingdom communication system enables effective communication between different species (bacteria and fungi) of microbes in the microbiome, and also between microbiome and the plant (Mohana Sheela et al. 2018). The best known example for interkingdom communication is between Agrobacterium and plant (Neelapu et  al. 2018). Both interspecies and intraspecies communication help in horizontal gene transfer of genetic material from the donor to the host leading to evolution in nature. The ultimate use of quorum sensing in plant–microbiome interactions is to sense the surrounding environment and adjust to changing ecological conditions by enhancing supplement uptake or other means which are described above and below. Though we can understand that these three different mechanisms of quorum sensing exist in the nature when microbes colonize plant, still there is need to establish the evidence in favor of these communication systems."

Various microbes are harmful to plants that limit growth and development. In general, plant root exudates comprising of sugars, amino acids, and organic acids attract the microbes. Plants have mechanism to recognize certain compounds released by microbes and enhance defense responses. During plant– microbe interaction, once the plant recognizes microbe; plant signalling hormones, such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ET activate the defense machinery in response to salt stresses (Koornneef and Pieterse 2008; Yi et  al. 2014; Jalil and Ansari 2018). In case of fungi–plant interactions, sugar levels are increased during fungi–plant interactions where sugars molecules act as priming molecules and are sensed by plant cell and act as a signalling molecule. This subsequently interacts with plant hormone signalling network thereby reprogramming the plant cells (Morkunas and Ratajczak 2014). When fungi are in the proximity of a plant cell, then sugar levels are increased which are important for providing energy and structural material for plants defense processes. Sugar priming increases oxidative burst, cell walls (lignification), flavonoids synthesis; and also induces pathogenesis related proteins. This induces plant immune system and also provides resistance to plants against fungi (if it is a pathogen) (Morkunas and Ratajczak 2014)."

The fungal biocontrol agents used to control insects are Beauveria, Culicinomyces, Hirsutella, Metarhizium, Nomuraea, Paecilomyces, Tolypocladium, and Verticillium. The fungal biocontrol agents which are used to control weeds are Trichoderma and Gliocladium. The fungal biocontrol agents used to control weed are Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f.sp. Sclerotinia minor. Fungal species such as Arthrobotrys, Verticillium chlamydosporium, Acremonium, Fusarium oxysporum, and Dactylella oviparasitica are used to control nematodes. The different mechanisms used by fungi for biocontrol are antagonism, antibiosis, and competition. In order to fullfill some of our knowledge gaps on fungi it is essential to continually explore fungal whole genomes. There are five next generation sequencing technologies available to generate NGS data: first, second, third, fourth, and fifth generation sequencing technologies. The first generation sequencing technologies include Sanger sequencing and Maxam–Gilbert sequencing method. The second generation sequencing method\n11 Global Scenario of Advance Fungal Research in Crop Protection\n338\nincludes Roche/454 sequencing, Ion torrent sequencing, Illumina/Solexa sequencing, and ABI/SOLiD sequencing. The third generation sequencing method includes Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing approach and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing approach. The fourth generation sequencing method includes nanopore based sequencing by biological nanopores and solid state nanopores. The fifth generation sequencing method includes high-fidelity nanopore sequencing of ultra-short DNA targets and cyclomics and ultra-sensitive nanopore sequencing of cell free tumor DNA. Better understanding of fungal genomes has truly opened another door to improving our utilization and reservation for fungi despite of several bioinformatics challenges regarding sequence assembly, gene annotation, and genome comparison. The growth in number of genome, transcriptome, and proteome data from fungi has created additional opportunity to evaluate, compare, and formulate an optimal product. The other global research areas in the biocontrol are synergies between different biocontrol agents, synergies between biocontrol agents and PGPR, and advances in the formulation of biocontrol agents.\nAcknowledgements VY, MM, CS, and NNRR are grateful to GITAM (Deemed to be University) for providing necessary facilities to carry out the research work and for extending constant support."
