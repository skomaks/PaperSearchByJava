      "text" : "During the past decade, there has been an explosion of research in nanomedicine area, resulting in scores of publications and products offering the new nanomaterials in this field. Nanomedicine involves using nanomaterials to enhance the efficiency of drugs in treatment and diagnosis. Compared to the conventional use of single molecules as contrast agents for in vivo and in vitro imaging, nanomaterials offer significant advantages and are providing important contributions to the diagnostic field. Furthermore, the use of nanomedicine formulations for therapeutic applications has increased exponentially. Nanomedicine formulations are advantageous over the standard low-molecular-weight drugs in several different regards. They reduce renal excretion and hepatic degradation, leading to prolonged circulation times. These nanosized materials aim to increase drug concentrations at the pathological site, while avoiding their accumulation in healthy nontarget tissues, thereby improving the balance between the efficacy and the toxicity of systemic chemotherapeutic interventions.1,2 So, nanomedicine has the potential to improve the therapeutic index of drugs by increasing their accumulation at the target site and reduce the side effects of therapeutics by reducing their localization in potentially endangered healthy organs.\nCorrespondence to: L.

Although the application of nuclear technology in nanomedicine is currently at an early stage, it is expected to have a significant impact on diagnosis and treatment. The number of radioactive nanoproducts being submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval is rapidly growing and new applications are continuously being developed. It is well-established that the properties of radioactive nanoparticles can differ from conventional radionuclides. Nanoradiopharmaceuticals show excellent promise as nuclear imaging and radiotherapy agents. A major advantage of nanosized radioactive particles is their potential to contain numerous radioactive atoms within a single nanoparticle.3,4 Each radioactive nanoparticle contains hundreds of radionucleides and, consequently, by delivering one radioactive nanoparticle to tumor site, hundreds of radionucleides are transported. Effective tumor radiotherapy requires maximum radioactivity (effective payload) near tumor site. However, the conventional methods will allow only one tumor-avid biomolecule to carry one radioactive atom. The nanoparticles that are surface conjugated to tumor-avid biomolecules will introduce higher ratio of radioactive particles to tumor-avid biomolecules (Fig. 1). Thus, radioactive nanoparticles will serve as excellent therapeutic agents for increased delivery of therapeutic payloads over a wide range of diseases especially in the cancer.\nFor the obvious reasons, the vast majority of efforts in the nuclear nanomedicine field have thus far focused on cancer. Nanomaterials are generally able to accumulate at tumor endothelial cells in nonspecific ways through enlarged gap junctions, by means of a mechanism known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The discovery of the EPR effect is considered to be one of the greatest breakthroughs leading to the development of targeted antitumor therapy. EPR effect was reported for the first time by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 while studying the in vivo behavior for antitumor protein antibiotic and SMANCS, the conjugate of neocarzinostatin and poly(styrene-co-maleic acid).5 It is a controversial concept by which nanoparticles of certain sizes\ntend to accumulate in tumor tissue much more than they do in normal tissues. In addition to the enhanced leakiness of tumorous vessels, the EPR effect is also based on the fact that solid tumors tend to lack functional lymphatics, thereby limiting the removal of extravasated nanomaterials from the target site. Unfortunately, local drug deposition is unfeasible for larger tumors with poor vascularization. In the modern cancer diagnosis and therapy, there is a great emphasis on creating new radioactive nanostructure formulations using of antibodies, aptamers, peptides, and other ligands to facilitate uptake by target cells.1 So far, effective targeted radiopharmaceutical therapeutics have been developed and validated for a few tumor types, such as malignant lymphoma.\nHere, we briefly summarize the basic principles of nanomaterial-based radiopharmaceuticals and the progress made on using these nanomaterials in area of diagnosis, therapeutic, and theranostic in recent years. The aim of this effort is to provide the reader with a clear and concise view of advances in the field of nanoparticle assisted nuclear medicine for molecular imaging and therapeutic functions."

      "text" : "In the past two decades, hundreds of novel nanomaterials with different shapes and properties have been introduced. So, the preparation, the characterization, and the classification of nanomaterials, as well as their applications, are essential.\nThe first classification idea of nanomaterials was given in 19956 and further was explained in 2000.7 A new classification scheme was reported in 2007 to overcome the limitations of previous classification methods.8 In this scheme, classification is based on the number of dimensions, which are not confined to the nanoscale range (<100 nm). They were characterized as (1) zero-dimensional (0D), (2) onedimensional (1D), (3) two-dimensional (2D), and (4) threedimensional (3D).9\nZero-dimensional nanomaterials. There are many 0D nanostructures, such as nanoparticles (NPs), quantum dots (QDs), and nanoclusters (NCs) in different terms [Fig. 2(a– c)].10–12 All three dimensions of these nanomaterials are within 100 nm, more specifically <50 nm in most cases.

Metal NPs, especially plasmonic NPs, have emerged as a very important class of nanosystems for clinical diagnostics. As the first demonstration of the biomedical potential of QDs in 1998,13 these 0D inorganic fluorescent nanomaterials with diameters in the range of 2–10 nm have been widely anticipated to find application in many clinical products. They play important roles in many branches of human life as a result of their exceptional photophysical properties and quantum confinement effects. NCs as a new class of 0D nanomaterials can be composed of a single or of multiple elements and typically measure < 2 nm. Since the last two decades, protein conjugated fluorescent NCs owe much attention in the field of medical and nanobiotechnology because of their excellent photo stability characteristics and good biocompatibility. Such NCs exhibit attractive optical and biochemical properties compared to their larger counterparts.\nOne-dimensional nanomaterials. As the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991,14 1D nanostructures such as nanotubes, nanorods, nanowires, nanobelts, nanoribbons, and nanofibers [Fig. 2(d–i)]15–20 have been at the forefront of nanotechnology research. 1D structure has one dimension outside of the nanometer size regime. They promise to provide the building blocks for a generation of new nanoradiopharmaceuticals.\nTwo-dimensional nanomaterials. The past decade has witnessed an extraordinary increase in research progress on ultrathin 2D nanomaterials in the field of biology after the\nexfoliation of graphene from graphite in 2004.21 This unique class of nanomaterials has only one dimension within 100 nm, whereas the other two dimensions are those of bulk materials. The common representations of 2D nanomaterials are nanoplates, nanosheets, nanowalls, and nanodisks [Fig. 2j–l].22–24\nThree-dimensional nanomaterials. 3D nanomaterials such as nanocoils, nanoballs, and nanoflowers are nanophase materials consisting of equiaxed nanometer-sized grains [Fig. 2(m–o)].25–27 These nanomaterials have attracted intensive research interests because they have higher surface areas and supply enough absorption sites for all involved molecules in a small space.\nNP-based targeted drug delivery Passive targeting. The passive targeting results in high drug concentration in tumors and reduced drug toxicity to the normal tissues. For this purpose, the paradigm of using NPs or nanoparticulate pharmaceutical carriers and various polymer-nanopharmaceuticals conjugates based on polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been well-established over the past decade.28 In the passive targeting, the drug’s success is directly related to circulation time. NPs are expected to stay in the blood for long time, accumulating in pathological sites with affected and leaky vasculature (tumors, inflammations and infarcted areas) via the EPR effect. In fact, well-designed NPs with an optimal size can have EPR effects to accumulate in tumor tissue. In addition, PEG is widely used as a watersoluble and biocompatible polymer in the field of passing\nJOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A | JAN 2019 VOL 107A, ISSUE 1 253\nREVIEW ARTICLE\ntargeting drug delivery. PEGylation increases the solubility, size, molecular mass, and serum stability of the nanopharmaceuticals. PEG-based amphiphilic materials can self-assemble into nanopharmaceuticals in aqueous media and provide a stealth surface that would reduce reticuloendothelial system (RES) recognition of NPs and prolong the circulation halflife.29 The RES consists of cells descending from the monocytes, which are able to perform phagocytosis of foreign materials and particles. It should be noted that 90% of the RES are located in the liver.30 The PEGylated nanocarriers that can evade the RES of the liver and spleen, enjoys a prolonged circulation in the blood, and allows for passive targeting through the EPR effect in leaky tumor tissues.\nActive targeting. Despite the fact that EPR effect provides the opportunity for tumor targeting, it is not applicable to low-vascular permeability cancers such as pancreatic cancer. In fact, this tumor type-dependent uptake without a targeting strategy shows that not all tumors are amenable to EPRdependent deliveries nor respond favorably to untargeted NP administration.31 In addition, passive targeting is often not enough for drug accumulation in tumors and PEGylation hinders the uptake of NPs by tumor cells once they extravasate. Where EPR is weak, NPs should be amenable to active targeting to enable permeation beyond the vasculature and into the tumor environment. Unlike passive targeting which demonstrate relative tumor selectivity as a consequence of EPR effect [Fig. 3(a)], active targeting results in higher intratumoral accumulation of nanocarrier and hence higher\ncellular concentration of the drug [Fig. 3(b)]. Therefore, it is desirable to develop active targeting systems that are able to selectively recognize specific cells or tissues. The concept of active targeting of drugs is based on the idea of attachment of specific ligands such as antibodies, aptamers, peptides, and so forth to the surface of pharmaceutical nanocarriers or NPs for specific interaction with the structures present on the cell surface.\nAs NPs have high surface area to volume ratios, they have become ideal platforms upon which surface charge, polymeric coating, and specific targeting ligands can be added to shape the NP biodistribution, reduce nonspecific uptake, and mimic a biological handshake. PEGylated nanopharmaceuticals can be also conjugated to targeting moieties by different conjugation chemistry to achieve the goal of active targeting."

Nuclear molecular imaging including positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is an attractive technology, which is widely used in clinical practice and greatly enhances our understanding of the pathophysiology and biochemistry. PET and SPECT have made a significant contribution for many years as to evaluate the physiological function and biochemical changes of molecular targets. Both techniques are based on the measurement of the radionuclide’s decay, during which a positron or a γ-ray will be emitted and thus generate photos. SPECT is similar to PET in its use of radioactive tracer material. In contrast with PET, however, the tracer used in SPECT emits gamma radiation that is measured directly. PET and SPECT have many advantages including high sensitivity, good spatial resolution, and limitless penetration depth, leading to their vital role in molecular imaging for both preclinical and clinical studies. Although both SPECT and PET have their own advantages and limitations, SPECT tends to be a more robust tool because SPECT radionuclides are characterized by longer half-life and can be produced by small generators while most PET radionuclides have a short half-life and usually need a cyclotron, which limits their availability and exponentially increases the cost and complexity of the application.\nAmong the diagnostic radionuclides, positron-emitting radionuclides are being more and more explored. Today, 18F is the most prevalent radionuclide used for PET. However, their short half-life (110 min) precludes the investigation of biochemical processes in the range of days and weeks. This is especially important for NPs accumulated in solid tumors from hours to days.34\nTherapeutic radionuclides in nuclear medicine The history of radionuclide therapy can be traced back to the early 1900s, after the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel and Marie Curie. In the last 20 years, radionuclide therapy has been widely used in various clinical malignant and pain management applications.35 Most of the radionuclides used are β emitters, which release highly energetic electrons that deposit their energy over up to several millimeters in the surrounding tissues.36 However, over the past 40 years, the therapeutic potential of several alpha particle emitting and Auger emitting radionuclides has been assessed.37 Alpha particle emitting isotopes are of considerable interest for radionuclide therapy because of their high cytotoxicity and short path length. The most commonly used therapeutic radionuclide today is iodine-131 labeled with sodium iodide (131I-NaI) in capsule or liquid form. The radioactive iodine therapy uses 131I to treat thyroid-related diseases such as Graves’ disease, solitary hyper-functioning nodule, and toxic multinodular goiter.38 Another major application of radionuclide therapy is in the treatment of bone metastasis.39 Radionuclide therapies are also used for the treatment of a variety of malignancies,40 polycythemia,41\nchronic joint disease with radiosynovectomy,42 and intravascular radiation therapy.43\nIn some nuclear medicine centers, low-dose rate brachytherapy sources are widely used for interstitial implants in tumor sites, particularly in prostate.44 Brachytherapy is a form of radiotherapy where a sealed radiation source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment. These sources generally produce gamma-rays, which have the same effect on cancer cells as X-rays. However, beta emitters are rarely used in brachytherapy; there are some reports in this area. Poorbaygi and co-workers45 developed production of glass microspheres comprising 90Y as source of therapeutic beta emissions and 177Lu as source of diagnostic gamma emissions for treating of hepatic tumors with SPECT imaging capabilities."

      "text" : "The concept of fabricating small NPs with radioactive property is a useful strategy for effective diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Radioactive NPs have the advantage that they can be accurately and precisely traced during each of the steps of their applications. So, the production of radioactive NPs or marking the nonradioactive NPs with radionuclides is being investigated for applications in nuclear nanomedicine. In this section, we attempted to explore various strategies for diagnosis and radiotherapy based on the radioactive NPs or radionuclide marked NPs.\nGold-198 Gold-198 NPs (198AuNPs) can be engineered with precise size, shape, composition, surface chemistry, radioactivity, and radionuclide purity for clinical applications in nuclear medicine. Aboudzadeh et al.46 prepared chitosan-capped AuNPs by exposing HAuCl4 to acidic chitosan solution under appropriate conditions and then irradiated in Tehran Research Reactor (TRR). They reported that the chitosan-198AuNPs with high radionuclide purity are produced using epithermal neutron-capture reaction, 197Au (n, γ) 198Au, are especially useful for cancer treatment and imaging. In another study reported by Lin et al.,47 a nanocomposite of gum arabic stabilized AuNPs (AuNPs@GA) was first synthesized by exposing the mixture of HAuCl4 and GA solution under synchrotron X-ray. Then, the prepared GAAuNPs was neutron-activated to generate radioactive GA-198AuNPs and evaluated with H460 tumor model (lung cancer) by intratumoral injection. The nanocomposite of 198AuNPs@GA successfully suppressed the tumor growth. The major accumulation of 198AuNPs@GA was 50.0% in the tumor, following by 8.9% in the liver. Meanwhile, the clearance increase of this radioactive nanocomposite was observed in urine and feces. The therapeutic effect of GA-198AuNPs was also investigated on the prostate cancer by Chanda and co-workers.48 For this purpose, subcutaneous tumors were generated in SCID mice by PC-3 engraftment. The significant reduction in tumor volume by GA-198AuNPs in prostate tumor-bearing SCID mice showed an important\nJOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A | JAN 2019 VOL 107A, ISSUE 1 255\nREVIEW ARTICLE\ndevelopment with potential for clinical application of this agent in reducing the size of prostate tumors before surgical resection and perhaps even to reduce or eliminate the need for surgical resection. The other studies have also supported the efficacy of 198AuNPs in treating prostate cancer. Shukla and co-workers49 hypothesized that the prostate tumor-specific epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCg) functionalized 198AuNPs will lead to 80% reduction in tumor volume after 28 days. An additional advantage of EGCg is its ability to target Laminin receptor (Lam 67R), which is over expressed on human prostate cancer cells.49 This novel intratumorally injectable 198AuNP-EGCg nanotherapeutic agent provided significant advances in oncology. Khan et al.50 described the fabrication of dendrimer-198AuNPs for targeted radiopharmaceutical dose delivery to prostate tumors in vivo. Poly(amidoamine) or PAMAM dendrimers are ideal for preparation of composite NPs. Using PAMAM dendrimers as templates, the composite NPs with precise size, nearly monodisperse distribution and with well-defined surface charge can be fabricated. The irradiation of aqueous solution of 197Au-dendrimer NPs in a nuclear reactor resulted in the formation of positively charged and soluble radioactive gold nanodevices. A single intratumoral injection of radioactive NPs in phosphate-buffered saline resulted after 8 days in a statistically significant 45% reduction in tumor volume, when compared with untreated groups and those injected with the non-radioactive NPs. In a recent study conducted by Laprise-Pelletier and co-workers,51 NPs made of an ultrasmall core of radioactive palladium (103Pd:Pd) with a gold coating (103Pd:Pd@Au and 103Pd:Pd@198Au:Au) were synthesized by a one-pot process. The 103Pd-labeled radioactive AuNPs were sequestrated in the tumor by coinjecting them with alginate, a biocompatible polymer. Alginate polymerizes upon contact with Ca2+ ions in the tumor environment. The proposed method provided evidence that the radioactive Pddoped AuNPs (<50 nm), coinjected with alginate, is efficiently retained in prostate cancer tumors for several weeks, where they deliver a dose that impacts on tumor growth. So, these radioactive core-shell NPs are suitable for low-dose prostate cancer brachytherapy."

The tissue distribution of chelator-free PEG-[64Cu]CuS NPs was imaged and quantified by PET/computed tomography (CT), allowing the dosimetry calculation and potential for prediction of thermal dose. As shown in Figure 4, most of the injected dose was retained in the tumor over a period of 48 h after intratumoral injection of PEG-[64Cu]CuS NPs. These findings showed that this multifunctional NPs merits further development as a novel therapeutic agent for ATC.

The choice of radionuclide depends on the desired duration of the imaging agent, as well as the desired type of imaging intrinsic to the radionuclide decay. Radionuclides such as 64Cu, 68Ga, 89Zr, 90Y, 99mTc, and 177Lu are best attached via chelation or chelatorfree surface adsorption.69 In this section, the various strategies for diagnosis and radiotherapy based on the radiolabeled nanoplatforms were introduced.\n0D nanocarriers This section focuses on the 0D nanocarrier-based radiopharmaceuticals. 0D nanomaterials introduced in section “Zerodimensional nanomaterials” act as the tailor-made drug delivery carriers that are capable of transporting high doses of radiotherapeutic and diagnostic agents into the cancerous cells while sparing healthy cells.\nNanoparticles. At the present early stage of development of nanoradiopharmaceuticals field, the NPs reported so far have been chosen from a very restricted range of materialstypically silica and gold NPs and superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs. With further progress of this field, more new NPs such as polymer based or inorganic NPs are introduced. NPs represent a promising basis for assembly of targeted PET molecular imaging agents. They are prone to aggregation, but this can be minimized by surface modification with alendronate or PEG while still retaining adequate capacity for radiolabeling. Polymer-based NPs. Polymer-based drug delivery nanocarriers have been extensively studied in the radiopharmaceutical field. Chitosan and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) are two of the most typical biodegradable and biocompatible polymers that have been approved by both the Food & Drug Administration and European Medicine Agency, signifying their transition from the laboratory to clinical oral and parental administration. In addition, among the biopolymers used in the medical field, the chitosan and PLA have received significant attention in the tissue engineering applications. Lee and co-workers70 developed a facile method to radiolabel glycol chitosan NPs with 64Cu via copper-free click chemistry for microPET imaging. The real time, in vivo biodistribution and tumor targeting ability of 64Cu-chitosan NPs were also evaluated in tumor-bearing mice using a whole-body microPET imaging system. In another experimental research described by Rajabi et al.,71 99mTc-chitosan NPs was synthesized and evaluated for imaging. Biodistribution and imaging studies"

PLA NPs are a type of polymeric NPs, frequently used as nuclear nanomedicines. For example, Sirianni and co-workers72 reported radiolabeling of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs with biotinylated 18F prosthetic groups and imaging of their delivery to the brain with PET. In another strategy designed by Yamamoto et al.,73 the radiosynthesis and initial evaluation of 18Flabeled nanocarrier composed of PLLA-block-poly(sarcosine) amphiphilic polydepsipeptide as an effective contrast agent for the tumor PET imaging technique were studied. For biodistribution studies, mice bearing HeLa cells in the femur region were used. Tumor PET imaging showed that 18Flabeled nanocarrier is a potential candidate for the facile and general solid tumor imaging technique. Arora and coworkers,74 proposed an innovative strategy of NP-mediatedpeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) using PLGA NPs together with anti-β-hCG antibodies that can protect kidneys from radiation damage, while simultaneously enhancing its tumor targeting and cytotoxic ability for somatostatin receptor (SSR) positive tumors. In fact, they evaluated cytotoxic and tumor targeting capability of PEG-coated 177Lu– DOTA–tyr3-octreotate(TATE peptide)–PLGA.\nIn recent years, polyesters have been used in NP formulations for the controlled release of drugs. Polyester-based NPs for drug delivery provide decreased drug dosage and protection and longer therapeutic action, ultimately translating to an increased therapeutic index.75 Di Mauro and coworkers76 described a facile approach for the 18Fradiolabeling of peptide-functionalized polyester-based NPs with potential applications in drug delivery. Their proposed method relied on radiolabeling of block co-polymers using the labeling agent 4-[18F]fluorobenzyl-2-bromoacetamide ([18F]FBBA). These block copolymers were ultimately incorporated in the polymer NPs as constituent elements. Finally, quantitative biodistribution data were obtained in vivo after intravenous administration in rodents using PET-CT Imaging. Tang et al.77 focused on radiolabeling polymer nanocarriers with the low-energy gamma emitter 125I. For this purpose, PEGylated polyvinyl phenol nanocarriers were radiolabeled with [125I]NaI to track their fate in vivo, ultimately by noninvasive means using PET or SPECT imaging. In a similar study, Simone and co-workers78 also reported an effective strategy for endothelial targeting of polyvinyl phenol NPs labeled with the radioisotope iodine-124. Targeting mAb or control IgG were adsorbed onto the polymeric NPs surface. This approach permitted the tracking of pharmacokinetics in real time and noninvasive imaging of the lung in mice, using the micro-PET imaging.\nOver the past decade, shell cross-linked knedel-like (SCK) polymeric NPs containing a large variety of functional groups have been successfully used in nanomedicine applications. Zeng and co-workers79 reported the development of a novel strategy for 64Cu labeling of SCK polymeric NPs. The proposed approach provided access to higher specific activity of core-labeled NPs. Rossin et al.80 also evaluated 64Curadiolabeled folate-conjugated SCK NPs as candidate agents to shuttle radionuclides and drugs into tumors overexpressing the folate receptor (FR). The biodistribution results confirmed the nonspecific accumulation of nontargeted SCKs in solid tumors. Despite high RES uptake, the evaluated 64Culabeled SCKs exhibited long circulation in blood and were able to passively accumulate in tumors. Furthermore, SCKfolate uptake was competitively blocked by excess folate in small-size solid tumors, suggesting the interaction with the folate receptor. The obtained results showed that the functionalized SCKs are promising drug-delivery agents for imaging and therapy of early stage solid tumors. Dextran as a group of glucose polymers refers to the complex branched glucose polysaccharides. They are used commonly by microsurgeons to decrease vascular thrombosis. Keliher and coworkers81 reported the preparation and the application of 89Zr-labeled dextran NPs for in vivo macrophage imaging. Tissue macrophages play a critical role in both normal physiology and disease states. However, because of a lack of specific imaging agents, there is a poor understanding of their absolute numbers, flux rates, and functional states in different tissues. 89Zr-labeled dextran NPs allowed the visualization of macrophage biology in vivo that it can be useful for a multitude of human applications. Hydroxyapatite NPs. Hydroxyapatite (HA) [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2] synthesized easily in desired NP size is a constituent of bone matrix. It is a natural substance known to be biodegraded into calcium and phosphate ions by natural metabolic processes and eliminated over a period of 6 weeks, thereby providing excellent biocompatibility. For many years, HA has been used successfully as a coating agent for implants in joint arthroplasty. In addition, HA is a common suitable carrier used in radiosynovectomy. Radiation synovectomy used by Fellinger and Schmid in 1952 for the first time is a therapeutic method to cure chronic synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia or orthopedic troubles.82 This method involves intra-articular injection of some β-emitting radionuclides to reduce pain and inflammation of the joint.83 Kamaleshwaran and co-workers84 described the first case report of use of 90Y-HA particulates in a 33-year-old male who presented with diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) of knee joint as a primary modality of treatment. PVNS is a joint disease characterized by inflammation and overgrowth of the joint lining. The obtained results showed that the 90YHA can be potentially used as an ideal agent for radiosynovectomy of the joints. Davarpanah et al.85 optimized fundamental parameters in routine production of 90Y-HA for radiosynovectomy. First human study and initial Indian experience in the treatment of painful synovitis and recurrent joint effusion of knee joints in rheumatoid arthritis using 177Lu-labeled HA was reported by Shinto and coworkers.86 Formerly, preparation and preliminary biological evaluation of 177Lu-labeled HA as a promising agent for radiation synovectomy of small joints was described by Chakraborty and co-workers.87 The use of 153Sm-HA for knee synovectomy in hemophilia was reported by Calegaro et al.88,89 Effectiveness of radiation synovectomy with 90Y and 153Sm particulate hydroxyapatite in rheumatoid arthritis\nJOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A | JAN 2019 VOL 107A, ISSUE 1 259\nREVIEW ARTICLE\npatients with knee synovitis was reported by dos Santos and co-workers.90 Jauregui-Osoro et al.91 selected [18F]-fluoride as the radiolabel to reduce the radiochemistry to the simplest level possible. They found that the hydroxyapatite can be quickly and efficiently labeled with 18F in the mild aqueous conditions and without need for complex purification steps. In addition, labeling was stable in vivo unless the NPs were taken up by the RES, whereupon degradation and release of fluoride took place over a period of several hours. These results showed that the radiolabeling of hydroxyapatite with 18F was robust, resistant to a variety of potential inhibitors and adequate for in vivo imaging applications. Silver NPs. Silver NPs (AgNPs) are increasingly finding applications in medicine; however, little is known about their in vivo tissue distribution. Chrastina and Schnitzer92 developed a rapid method for radiolabeling of poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-capped AgNPs with 125I to track in vivo tissue uptake of AgNPs after systemic administration by biodistribution analysis and SPECT imaging. In addition, Kucka et al.93 developed a NP system with a silver core, stabilized by protein-based coating and covered by a covalently bound poly(ethylene oxide) shell. Then, the prepared NPs were labeled with alpha emitter astatine-211 (211At). 211At is a promising radionuclide for α-particle therapy of cancers. Its physical characteristics make this radionuclide particularly interesting to consider when bound to cancer-targeting biomolecules for the treatment of microscopic tumors. Nanozeolites. Zeolites are biocompatible crystalline aluminosilicates composed of tetrahedral structures which build an open framework consisting of channels and cages of molecular dimensions. Each tetrahedron containing aluminum formally bears one unit of negative charge, because aluminum atom is connected to four oxygen atoms. To make the crystal electrically neutral metal cations (e.g., Na+, K+, Ca2+) are present in the interstices of the zeolitic framework. So, the zeolite nanostructures with different selectivities can act as the ion-exchanger. Piotrowska et al.94 proposed the use of nanozeolite whose channels and cavities were filled with cations of 224Ra and 225Ra by means of simple ion exchange without any additional operations. The 223Ra, 224Ra, and 225Ra radioisotopes exhibit very attractive nuclear properties for application in radionuclide therapy. Unfortunately, the lack of appropriate bifunctional ligands for radium is the reason why these radionuclides have not found application in receptor-targeted therapy.94 These α-particle emitting radionuclides were absorbed in the nanometer-sized NaA zeolite (30–70 nm) through simple ion exchange. 224Ra and 225Ra radiolabeled nanozeolites exhibited very high stability in human serum. Some years later, nanozeolite bioconjugates labeled with 223Ra for targeted alpha therapy was reported by Piotrowska and co-workers.95 For this purpose, NaA nanozeolite was synthesized using the template method. Next, the nanozeolite particles were conjugated to the Substance P (5–11) peptide fragment, which targets NK-1 receptors on glioma cells. The NaA-silane-PEG-SP(5–11) bioconjugates were labeled with 223Ra by exchange of the Na+ cation and the stability, receptor affinity and cytotoxicity of the obtained radiobioconjugates were tested. Substance P functionalized nanozeolite represented a viable solution for the use of the 223Ra in vivo generator as a therapeutic construct for targeting glioma cells. Silica NPs. In recent years, among the various nanocomposite systems, silica NPs have been investigated extensively for a variety of applications in drug delivery platforms, bioimaging, and other important biomedical studies owing to their unique and favorable features, such as a high-loading capacity of various therapeutic or imaging agents that result from large pore volume and their large surface area, low cytotoxicity, excellent biocompatibility, biochemical stability, facile surface modification potential, and multifunctionality.96 Shaffer and co-workers97 investigated the ability of amorphous silica NPs to bind a variety of medically important radioisotopes with a range of half-lives and emissions without the need for additional chelators. In particular, they explored the labeling efficiency of 68Ga, 64Cu, 89Zr, 90Y, 111In, and 177Lu under various temperatures, pH, and incubation times. Intrinsically labeled silica NPs prepared by this approach demonstrated excellent in vivo stability and efficacy in lymph node imaging. This group also developed stable radiolabeling of sulfur-functionalized silica NPs with softer radiometal, such as the widely used 64Cu.98 Copper-64 does not stably bind to the silica matrix and quickly dissociate under physiological conditions. They overcame this limitation through the use of silica NPs functionalized with a soft electron donating thiol-group to allow stable attachment of 64Cu. This approach significantly improved the stability of 64Cu-labeled thiol-functionalized silica NPs relative to native silica NPs, thereby enabling in vivo (lymph node) PET imaging and may be translated to other softer radiometals with affinity for sulfur. In another study, grafting of [64Cu]TPPF20 porphyrin complex on functionalized nanoporous MCM-41 silica as a potential cancer imaging agent was developed by Fazaeli and co-workers.99 MCM-41 is a mesoporous material with a hierarchical structure from a family of silicate and alumosilicate solids that were first developed by researchers at Mobil Oil Corporation and found use in various applications such as control drug release and drug delivery with positive results till now.99,100 In the proposed work, mesoporous silica MCM-41 was functionalized with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to obtain a promising carrier system for delivery of [64Cu]-TPPF20 complex as a theranostic anticancer agent. They reported the successful selective accumulation of the grafted complex, [64Cu]TPPF20@NH2-MCM-41, in Fibrosarcoma tumor cells. Di Pasqua et al.101 also explored silica MCM-41 NPs as a carrier material for the stable isotope 165Ho. 166Ho-MCM-41 NPs were administered intravenously (i.v.) to orthotopic nonsmall cell lung cancer A549-luciferase tumor-bearing mice. The obtained results demonstrated that mesoporous silica MCM-41 NPs can deliver significant amounts of a therapeutic radionuclide to tumors after i.v. injection. In a similar study conducted by Di Pasqua et al.102 166Ho-containing mesoporous MCM-41 silica NPs were introduced as a potential radionuclide therapeutic agent for ovarian cancer. The tissue biodistribution studies and radiotherapeutic efficacy using PET/CT were performed after intraperitoneal administration"

Miller et al.103 reported synthesis, characterization, and biodistribution of multiple 89Zr-labeled pore-expanded mesoporous silica NPs for PET. 89Zr4+ was immobilized through covalent attachment of the complexing agent p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine (DFO-NCS) to large-pore mesoporous silica NPs. Owing to the presence of the high DFO content on the silica NPs, quantitative 89Zr4+ labeling was achieved within just a few minutes, and no subsequent purification step was needed to remove noncomplexed 89Zr4+. The stability and biodistribution studies of the 89Zr-labeled silica NPs suggested that 89Zr-DFO-silica NPs were promising PET imaging agents for long-term in vivo imaging. Lee and co-workers104 prepared 18F-azadibenzocyclooctatriazoles (DBCOT)-PEG-silica NPs by the strain-promoted alkyne azide cycloaddition (SPAAC) reaction, which can successfully accumulate in the tumor site by the EPR. SPAAC referred to copper-free click chemistry has been used widely as a rapid bio-orthogonal conjugation method for a variety of biological applications. Kong et al.105 optimized the radiolabeling amine-functionalized silica NPs with a solution of 57Co2+-doped carrier Co2+ using hexaazamacrobicyclic cage ligand 1-N-(4-aminobenzyl)-3,6,10,13,16,19-hexaazabicyclo [6.6.6]eicosane-1,8-diamin (SarAr-NCS) for applications in imaging and radiotherapy. This article showed potential of SarAr-NCS ligand conjugated NPs in theranostic imaging and radiotherapeutic applications. In another paper published by Pascual et al.,106 MUC1 aptamer-capped mesoporous silica NPs were synthesized for controlled drug delivery and radio-imaging applications. MUC1 is a cell surface protein overexpressed in breast cancer. The proposed radio-labeled nanocomposite showed a remarkable tumor targeting in in vivo studies with MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing Balb/c mice. Lanthanide phosphate NPs. Lanthanide phosphate NPs (LnPO4 NPs) are well suited for biomedical applications. These nanomaterials are stable in aqueous solvents, relatively nontoxic, and have a high resistance to radiation damage. So, LnPO4 NPs are promising candidates as carriers for α and β emitters in imaging applications. McLaughlin and coworkers107 presented a viable method for containing 225Ac and its daughter products and minimizing their spread throughout the body. They synthesized gold-coated LnPO4 NPs for the 225Ac in vivo alpha generator. In vivo generator radionuclides, such as 223Ra, 225Ra, and 225Ac, are of special interest for radiotherapeutic applications as they emit multiple α-particles during their decay. Utilizing appropriate carriers capable of retaining both the parent radioisotope and daughter products is important for the effective delivery of the radioisotope to the tumor site while mitigating global in vivo radiotoxicity. In recent years, several attempts have been made to examine the ability of layered NP constructs to retain these radionuclides. In another study conducted by Woodward et al.,108 225Ac was incorporated into LnPO4 NPs to determine whether the radioisotope and its daughters would be retained within the dense mineral lattice. The 225Ac-doped NPs were conjugated to the mAb 201B, which targeted mouse lung endothelium through the vasculature, to ascertain the targeting efficacy and in vivo retention of radioisotopes. Standard biodistribution techniques and microSPECT/CT imaging of 225Ac as well as the daughter radioisotopes showed that the NPs accumulated rapidly in mouse lung after intravenous injection. Rojas et al.109 also reported synthesis and characterization of LnPO4 NPs as carriers for 223Ra and 225Ra for targeted alpha therapy. Sobol and co-workers110 described the synthesis and targeting of gold-coated 177Lu-containing LnPO4 NPs as a potential theranostic agent for pulmonary metastatic disease. The prepared [177Lu]Lu0.5 Gd0.5(PO4)@Au@PEG800@Ab NPs combined the radiation resistance of crystalline lanthanide phosphate for stability, the magnetic properties of gadolinium for facile separations, and a gold coating that can be readily functionalized for the attachment of targeting moieties. The NPantibody conjugate could target and deliver multiple beta radiations to a single biologically relevant receptor. Gold NPs. Gold NPs (AuNPs) have been extensively used in biological applications because of their biocompatibility, size, stability, and ease of characterization, as well as an extensive knowledge of their surface chemistry. These features make AuNPs ideal nanocarriers for drug delivery and novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. To integrate PET/SPECT imaging capability into AuNPs, the most common way is to attach a radiometal onto the AuNPs via a metal chelator. However, the attachment of radionuclide-chelator complexes will influence the surface properties of the NPs and reduce the capability of loading other targeting or therapeutic agents.111 In fact, coupling radionuclides to AuNPs via a chelator faces the challenges of possible detachment of the radionuclides and surface property changes of the NPs. Given that the PET imaging with 64Cu appears more promising for future NPs-based imaging studies, Zhao et al.112 reported a chelator-free strategy for 64Cu radiolabeling through 64Cu alloyed AuNPs for cancer imaging. They next studied the passive targeting capability of 64CuAuNPs through the EPR effect in an EMT-6 mouse breast cancer model using a small animal PET/CT system. The proposed radiolabeling strategy allowed the development of high specific activity, stably labeled 64CuAuNPs for accurate tracking of their in vivo fate and minimized the misinterpretation of PET imaging results. This protocol demonstrated the potential of AuNPs as a nanoplatform for further oncological PET imaging. In a similar study, Sun and coworkers111 reported a simple and general chelator-free 64Cu radiolabeling method by chemically reducing 64Cu on the surface of PEG-stabilized spherical AuNPs regardless of their shape and size. The 64Cu-integrated nanospheres are proved to be radiochemically stable and could provide an accurate and sensitive localization of spherical NPs through noninvasive PET imaging. In the traditional radiolabeling methods, 64Cu is conjugated to the surface NPs through macrocyclic chelators such as 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA). A research by Tian et al.113 investigated the intratumoral uptake of hollow gold nanospheres (HAuNS) after hepatic intra-arterial (IA) and intravenous (IV) injection in a liver tumor model. They conjugated cyclic arginine-glycineaspartic acid (RGD) peptides with the 64Cu-labeled PEG-\nJOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A | JAN 2019 VOL 107A, ISSUE 1 261\nREVIEW ARTICLE\nHAuNS to target the αVβ3-integrin receptors. In this method, DOTA-lipoic acid (LA) was labeled with 64Cu prior to introduction to HAuNS. The obtained results also showed that noninvasive PET imaging of 64Cu-labeled HAuNS was useful for tracking the in vivo distribution and for quantitative estimation of tumor uptake of HAuNS after IV and hepatic IA injection. Yang and co-workers114 introduced a highly monodispersed hetero-nanostructure with two different functional nanomaterials (Au and Fe3O4) within one structure as Affibody based trimodality nanoprobe (PET and MRI) for imaging of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) positive tumors. Such hetero-nanoprobes could provide a robust nanoplatform for surface-specific modification with both targeting molecules (anti-EGFR Affibody protein) and radiometal 64Cu chelators in highly efficient and reliable manner. In addition, affibody proteins used, have certain advantages for tumor-targeted imaging comparing to antibodies, including their much smaller size and lower molecular weight, faster tumor targeting ability, more well-defined structure, which could potentially be site-specifically modified and can be chemically synthesized. Affibodies as a new class of engineered scaffold proteins with a three-helix bundle structure have shown high promise for development of tumor targeting agents. Here, the in vitro and in vivo studies showed that the resultant nanoprobe provided high specificity, sensitivity, and excellent tumor contrast for both PET and MRI imaging in the human EGFR expressing cells and tumors. The obtained results also highlighted the EGFR targeting efficiency of heteronanoparticles and the feasibility for their further theranostic applications. Xie et al.115 reported radiolabeling of gold nanoshells with copper-64 for PET imaging in rat tumor model.\n89Zr has an ideal long physical half-life (78.41 h) for PET imaging of intact mAbs, which require time (typically 2–4 days) to reach optimal biodistribution and tumor targeting. Karmani and co-workers116 studied the biodistribution of 89Zr-labeled cetuximab Ab before and after the coupling reaction to AuNPs. Tumor and liver uptakes were assessed at different times after injection using quantitative PET imaging. In vivo distribution studies revealed no significant difference in tumor uptake for cetuximab conjugated to AuNPs up to 72 h after injection, compared with unconjugated cetuximab. Immuno-PET studies showed that AuNPscetuximab-89Zr provided high tumor-to-background ratio. In vivo blocking experiments demonstrated selective tumor targeting after coupling reaction. In another study reported by Karmani et al.,117 the 89Zr-labeled anti-CD105 Ab was conjugated with AuNPs for the first time. They demonstrated that, despite the decreased tumor uptake after NP conjugation, the in vivo antibody specificity and the tumor contrast in PET imaging are preserved. CD105-dependent tumor targeting was also confirmed by the quantification of Au in tumors. Thus, their studies validated 89Zr-anti endoglin AbAuNPs as a new tool for diagnostic and imaging of cancer.\nSeveral studies covalently labeled the AuNPs with 18F to investigate the in vivo distribution of these NPs by PET. For example, Guerrero and co-workers118 demonstrated the ability of targeted spherical AuNPs conjugated to the\namphipathic peptide CLPFFD to remove the toxic β-amyloid aggregates involved in Alzheimer’s disease. Then, they covalently labeled the C(AuNP)-LPFFD with [18F]-fluorobenzoate to study the in vivo distribution of the AuNP by PET. After intravenous administration in rat, the highest concentration of the radiolabeled conjugate was found in the bladder and urine with a lower proportion in the intestine, demonstrating progressive accumulation compatible with biliary excretion of the conjugate. The conjugate also accumulated in the liver and spleen. PET imaging allowed them to study the in vivo biodistribution of the AuNPs in a noninvasive and sensitive way using a reduced number of animals. Their results showed that AuNPs can be covalently and radioactively labeled for PET biodistribution studies. The other research groups reported synthesis and conjugation of maleimide-derivatized AuNPs with 18F-labeled SiFA-SH, a radiolabeling prosthetic group, or peptides such as the somatostatin receptor targeting peptide cys-TATE for PET imaging.119–121 The multiple maleimide end groups on the AuNP surface also allows for the simultaneous incorporation of [18F]SiFA-SH and a bioactive peptide (cysteine-modified octreotate, cys-TATE, which can bind to somatostatin receptor subtypes 2 and 5). The well-defined Michael addition reaction between various thiol containing molecules and the multifunctionalized maleimide-AuNPs thus offers an opportunity to develop a new bioconjugation platform for new diagnostics and therapeutics.\nThe conjugation of peptides to AuNPs produces biocompatible and stable multimeric systems with target-specific molecular recognition. In addition, the 99mTc-radiolabeled peptides via hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC) chelator have been reported as radiopharmaceuticals in the noninvasive monitoring of targets by molecular imaging techniques.122 HYNIC is a good chelator for 99mTc and suitable for radiolabeling peptides for molecular imaging purposes. Incorporation of AuNPs into 99mTc-labeled peptides can lead to improved accuracy and sensitivity of diagnosis. MendozaSánchez et al.123 proposed a multifunctional system of 99mTc-labeled AuNPs conjugated to Lys3-bombesin/HYNICGGC and evaluated its biological behavior as a potential radiopharmaceutical for in vivo gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-r) imaging. The gastrin releasing peptidereceptor is overexpressed in breast and prostate cancer and lymph node metastases and Lys3-bombesin is a peptide that binds with high affinity to the GRP-r. The clinical studies in women using radio-bombesin derivatives have shown successful radionuclide imaging of breast tumors.124 In the proposed protocol, 99mTc-AuNPLys3-bombesin showed specific recognition for GRP-r overexpressed in PC-3 cells. Biodistribution studies were accomplished in athymic mice with PC-3-induced tumors and images obtained using a microSPECT/CT system. Jiménez-Mancilla et al.125 also evaluated the in vitro potential of 99mTc-labeled and 177Lu-labeled AuNPs conjugated to Tat(49–57)-Lys3-bombesin peptides (99mTc/177Lu-AuNP-Tat-BN) as a plasmonic photothermal therapy and targeted radiotherapy system in PC3 prostate cancer cells. HIV Tat(49–57) is a cell-penetrating peptide that reaches the DNA. In cancer cells, 177Lu shows efficient"

The designed nanosystem exhibited properties suitable for plasmonic photothermal therapy and targeted radiotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer. RGD-based peptides are the most common peptide motifs responsible for cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), found in species ranging from Drosophila to humans. Morales-Avila et al.122 prepared a multimeric system of 99mTc-labeled AuNPs conjugated to cyclo[Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys-(Cys)] (c[(RGD)fK-(C)]) peptide and investigated its biological behavior as a potential radiopharmaceutical for molecular imaging of tumor angiogenesis. in vitro binding studies were carried out in αVβ3 receptorpositive C6 glioma cancer cells. Biodistribution studies were accomplished in athymic mice with C6-induced tumors with blocked and nonblocked receptors, and images were obtained using a micro-SPECT/CT. The obtained results showed that 99mTc-AuNP-RGD is a potential target-specific radiopharmaceutical for molecular imaging of tumor αVβ3expression. Another radiolabeling procedure was designed by Ocampo-Garcia and co-workers.126 The aim of this research was to develop a kit for 99mTc labeling of AuNPs that are conjugated to Lys3-bombesin, c[(RGD)fK-(C)] or thiol-mannose to produce receptor-specific multimeric systems. 99mTcAuNP-Lys3-bombesin, 99mTc-AuNP-c[RDGfK(Cys)] and 99mTcAuNP-mannose showed properties suitable for use as targetspecific agents for molecular imaging of GRP-r-positive tumors, tumor anb3 expression and sentinel lymph node detection, respectively. According to Yang et al.,127 RGD peptide targeted AuNPs loaded with gadolinium (Gd) and labeled with 99mTc (RGD@AuNPs-Gd99mTc) was prepared with different sizes for dual-mode SPECT/CT imaging of an orthotopic hepatic carcinoma model. A recent study conducted by Zhou et al.128 reported the 99mTc-labeled RGD-polyethylenimine (PEI) conjugates with entrapped AuNPs in the cavities for dual-mode SPECT/CT imaging of hepatic carcinoma. OcampoGarcia and co-workers129 also prepared a multifunctional system of 99mTc-labeled AuNPs conjugated to HYNICGGC/mannose and evaluated its biological behavior as a potential radiopharmaceutical for sentinel lymph node detection (SLND). They demonstrated that 99mTc-AuNP-mannose remains within the first lymph node during 24 h and therefore might be useful as a target-specific radionanoconjugate for SLND using “1-day” or “2-day” conventional protocols.\nAs the moderate energy β-particles emitted by 177Lu have a 2 mm maximum range, this provides a conformal radiation field around the injection site and a local cross-fire effect. So, radiolabeling of AuNPs with 177Lu is suitable for therapeutic objectives. Vilchis-Juárez et al.130 evaluated the therapeutic response of 177Lu-AuNP-RGD in athymic nude mice bearing αVβ3-integrin-positive C6 gliomas and compared the radiation absorbed dose, metabolic activity, histological characteristics, and VEGF gene expression in tumor tissues following treatment with 177Lu-AuNP-RGD, 177LuAuNP or 177Lu-RGD. The findings demonstrated that 177LuAuNP-RGD significantly induced less tumor progression, less tumor metabolic activity, fewer intratumoral vessels, and\nless VEGF gene expression than the other radiopharmaceuticals, a consequence of high tumor retention and a combination of molecular targeting therapy (multimeric RGD system) and radiotherapy (177Lu). According to Yook et al.,131 AuNPs were modified with PEG chains (4 kDa) derivatized with DOTA chelators for complexing the β-emitter, 177Lu and with PEG chains (5 kDa) linked to panitumumab for targeting breast cancer (BC) cells expressing epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR). The binding and internalization of EGFRtargeted AuNPs (177Lu-T-AuNPs) into BC cells were studied and compared to nontargeted AuNPs (177Lu-NT-AuNPs). The cross-fire effect of the β-particles emitted by 177Lu was valuable for eradicating (BC) cells in tumors that had low or moderate EGFR expression or cells that were not targeted by 177Lu-T-AuNP as a consequence of heterogeneous intratumoral distribution. The radiation dose to the nucleus of a single MDA-MB-468 cell was more than 177Lu-NT-AuNP. They concluded that 177Lu-T-AuNP is a promising novel radiation nanomedicine with potential application for treatment of triple-negative tumors (TNBC), in which EGFR is often overexpressed. In another study by this research group, intratumorally injected 177Lu-labeled AuNPs-gold nanoseed brachytherapy with application for neo-adjuvant treatment of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) was investigated.132 They observed that injected 177Lu-T-AuNP or 177Lu-NT-AuNP arrested the growth of MDAMB-468 human BC tumors in CD-1 athymic mice with no observable normal tissue toxicity. As EGFR-targeting did not provide greater tumor retention or higher tumor radiation absorbed doses, and both 177Lu-T-AuNP and 177Lu-NTAuNP were equivalently effective for arresting tumor growth, nontargeted gold nanoseeds could be applied for neo-adjuvant BRT of LABC, which would broaden the approach to tumors expressing many different phenotypes. Recently, this group reported local radiation treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer using trastuzumab (anti-HER2 Ab)-modified gold NPs labeled with 177Lu.133 Azorín-Vega and co-workers134 also evaluated the tumoral fibrosis effect on the radiation absorbed dose of the radiopharmaceuticals 177Lu-TATE (monomeric) and 177Lu-TATE-AuNPs (multimeric) using an experimental HeLa cells tumoral model and the Monte Carlo PENELOPE code. Experimental and computer micro-environment models with or without fibrosis were constructed. Results showed that fibrosis increases up to 33% the tumor radiation absorbed dose, although the major effect on the dose was produced by the type of radiopharmaceutical (112 Gy-multimeric vs. 43 Gymonomeric).\nNew techniques to improve brain visualization and assess drug permeability across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) are critically needed. For this purpose, Frigell et al.135 developed the synthesis of glucose (the brain’s principal nutrient) coated AuNPs (GNPs) carrying BBB-permeable neuropeptides (C11GNP, LipGNP, C11-EnkGNP, Lip-EnkGNP, C11GlycopepGNP, Lip-GlycopepGNP) and a NOTA derivative as the chelator of the positron emitter 68Ga (PET reporter) for in vivo tracking biodistribution. Depending on the nature of the ligands attached to the gold surface, a different\nJOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A | JAN 2019 VOL 107A, ISSUE 1 263\nREVIEW ARTICLE\nbiodistribution profile was observed. They observed that targeted GNPs bearing a Leu-enkephalin peptide (Enk) improves the brain accumulation nearly threefold compared to nontargeted GNPs.\nThe radioisotope palladium (103Pd), encapsulated in millimeter-size seed implants, is widely used in prostate cancer brachytherapy. AuNPs distributed in the vicinity of 103Pd radioactive implants, strongly enhance the therapeutic dose of radioactive implants (radiosensitization effect). Djoumessi et al.136 developed a new strategy to replace millimeter-size implants, consist in injecting radioactive NPs in the affected tissues. The development of 103Pd@AuNPs distributed in the diseased tissue could increase the uniformity of treatment (compared with massive seeds), while enhancing the radiotherapeutic dose to the cancer cells (through Au-mediated radiosensitization effect).\nAn indium-111-labeled AuNPs platform, modified with the RGD peptide was developed by Ng et al.137 and utilized for in vitro and in vivo tumor cell targeting. NPs were designed to be injected intravenously, travel to the tumor cell, internalize via aVß3-integrin mediated endocytosis, and allow imaging via subsequent gamma emission. The obtained results demonstrated the vast potential of direct labeling with radioisotopes for tracking AuNPs within biological systems.\nIt is well-known that iodide is strongly adsorbed on noble metal surfaces such as Au, Pd, and Pt, forming strong surface covalent bonds. The degree of specific adsorption of halides on the gold surface increases in the order of F− < Cl− < Br− < I−, indicating the decreasing energy of solvation of these species. In addition, iodine has a high affinity for AuNPs via chemisorption to the particle surface. This phenomenon was applied to elaborate new methods for iodination of biomolecules using the AuNPs as a metal bridge between iodine and a biomolecule. Labeling become quick and efficient simply by mixing of the two components with no complicated chemistry involved. However, low levels of free iodide will remove the isotope by ligand exchange. Walsh138 reported that the chemisorption of 125I to AuNPs can be used for real time quantitation and potential use in nanomedicine. With a variety of iodine isotopes (i.e., 124I, 125I, 131I) with different properties of half-lives and radio emissions, there is a great potential to create targeted NPs with a range of imaging and therapeutic properties in vivo.\nAlpha particle emitting isotopes are of considerable interest for radionuclide therapy because of their high cytotoxicity and short path length. Owing to the relatively high availability, astatine-211 (At as a homolog of iodine) is actually the most prospective an emitter for targeted radiotherapy. The factor limiting the use of 211At in targeted therapy is the low in vivo stability of the obtained astatinated bioconjugates. A study by Dziawer and co-workers139 was done to elaborate a new approach that can be applied for labeling biomolecules with 211At. In the proposed work, AuNPs were modified with Substance P(5–11), a peptide fragment which targets the NK1 receptors on the glioma cells, through the HS–PEG–NHS linker. Bioconjugates were synthesized with high yield in a two-step procedure. It was determined that\n47 and 3300 molecules of Substance P(5–11) were attached to one AuNP. The obtained AuNP–S–PEG–SP(5–11) conjugates were labeled with 211At by chemisorptions on the gold surface. The synthesized 211At-AuNP-S-PEG-SP(5–11) radiobioconjugate exhibited a high cytotoxic effect in vitro on glioma cells. Metal oxide NPs. Metal oxide NPs are currently manufactured at the industrial level and have a wide variety of applications in industrial and healthcare products. They are extremely difficult to detect and quantify once distributed in a material or biological system. One possibility to overcome this problem consists of labeling the metal oxide NPs with radionuclides that can lead to their detection in biological systems by means of ultrahigh sensitivity techniques such PET or SPECT as is routinely done for pharmaceutical compounds.140,141 For example, Pérez-Campaña and coworkers141 reported the production of 18F-labeled TiO2 NPs by proton irradiation for biodistribution and biological fate studies in rats. The accumulation of NPs in different organs was quantified during almost 8 h after administration.\nCerium oxide NPs (ceria NPs) are novel synthetic antioxidant agents proposed for treating oxidative stress-related diseases. The synthesis of high-quality ceria NPs for biomedical applications remains a challenging task. A major concern for the safe use of these NPs as pharmacological agents is their tendency to agglomerate. Herein, we present a ceria NPs-based radiopharmaceuticals for PET imaging. Rojas and co-workers142 reported the biodistribution in rodents of CeNPs functionalized with amino groups in which a 4-[18F] fluorobenzoyl moiety has been anchored to obtain pharmacokinetic data by PET. In this strategy, 18F isotope was anchored by reaction of N-succinimidyl 4-[18F]fluorobenzoate (18F-SFB) with a modified NP surface obtained by silylation with 3-aminopropylsilyl. Radiolabeled ceria NPs accumulated mainly in lungs, spleen, and liver. Metabolic products of the radiolabeled nanoparticulate material were excreted into the urinary tract. This methodology enabled the in vivo quantification of the labeled compound in each organ, especially during the initial minutes after administration when vascular trapping and phagocytosis occurs.\nAmong the potential metal oxide NPs, iron oxide NPs (magnetite Fe3O4 and maghemite Fe2O3) have been extensively studied in the field of biomedical applications mainly for their magnetic properties, chemical stability, nontoxicity, and cost-effectiveness. These magnetic NPs are stable in biological environments and are protected from unwanted nonspecific binding and RES uptake.143 In recent years, they are widely used as MRI contrast agents. Although this specific modality has a high resolution, the sensitivity of contrastenhanced acquisitions is limited.144 This limitation can be overcome by modifying iron oxide NPs with additional components to establish dual- or multi-modal imaging agents. Over the last decade, radiolabeled Fe3O4 NPs have been developed as promising contrast agents for dual-modality PET/MRI or SPECT/MRI. Iron-oxide NPs can act as contrast agents in MRI, while radiolabeling of the same platform with nuclear medicine isotopes allows imaging with PET or SPECT. The combination of PET (or SPECT) with MRI can"

In addition, PET-MRI scanners for clinical imaging and SPECT-MRI for preclinical imaging are commercially available and, therefore, offer a platform for novel dual-modality tracers.\nThere are three strategies to radiolabel Fe3O4 NPs. The first strategy is based on bifunctional ligands with a chelate for the radionuclide and an anchor for the Fe3O4 NPs surface. This approach involves initial radiolabeling of the ligands, followed by coating on the Fe3O4 surface. Another possibility of radiolabeling Fe3O4 NPs is the covalent attachment of a chelator to the existing coating and subsequent labeling with a radionuclide. Intrinsically radiolabeled Fe3O4 NPs, not requiring chelators for the radionuclides, represent the third strategy, achieved for instance by incorporating 111In during the synthesis of Fe3O4 NPs. 144\nA common approach to generate magnetic radiolabeled NPs is to attach 64Cu through chelation onto the Fe3O4 surface. For this purpose, the most common used method is to chelate the radionuclide to a bifunctional polyazacarboxylate- or a tetraaza-macrocycle.145 Jarrett et al.145 used the first strategy for 64Cu radiolabeling of dextran sulfate-coated superparamagnetic Fe3O4 NPs targeted toward inflammatory events, such as atherosclerotic plaques. The labeling was done by coordination of the 64Cu to the chelating bifunctional ligand p-SCNBz (S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl))-DOTA and then conjugation to the NP. They also described a synthetic route for a 64Cu-radiolabeled model imaging probe utilizing an aliphatic amine polystyrene microsphere as another example for radiolabeling of NPs. In a similar strategy, the synthesis of 64CuII-bis(dithiocarbamatebisphosphonate) and its conjugation with superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs as dual-modality PET–MRI agent was reported by de Rosales and co-workers146 for in vivo studies. Another example of this strategy is the labeling of NH2 end functionalized superparamagnetic γ-Fe2O3 with 64Cu using DOTA.147 The ability to design and produce physiologically stable radiolabeled magnetic NPs with a finely controlled number of functionalizable end groups on the γ-Fe2O3 enabled the generation of a desirable and biologically compatible multimodality PET/SPECT-MRI agent on a single T2 contrast MRI probe. Xie et al.148 utilized dopamine to modify the surface of Fe3O4 NPs, yielding nanoconjugates that can be easily encapsulated into human serum albumin (HSA) matrices. Then, the HSA-coated NPs were dually labeled with 64Cu-DOTA and Cy5.5 and tested in a subcutaneous U87MG xenograft mouse model [Fig. 7(a)]. In vivo PET/near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)/MRI tri-modality imaging, and ex vivo analyses and histological examinations were carefully conducted to investigate in vivo behavior of the nanostructures. Ex vivo PET imaging on tumor and the major organs showed substantial intensities from tumor and high tracer accumulation in the liver [Fig. 7(b)]. In another research, an efficient NP-based dual-modality PET/MRI contrast agent was developed by Glaus and co-workers.149 This probe consisted of a superparamagnetic Fe3O4 NPs core coated with PEGylated phospholipids. The chelator DOTA was conjugated to PEG termini to allow labeling with positron-emitting 64Cu. The 64Cu-Fe3O4 NPs probes produced strong MR and PET signals and were stable in mouse serum for 24 h at 37 C. Biodistribution and in vivo PET/CT imaging studies of the probes showed a circulation half-life of 143 min, and high initial blood retention with moderate liver uptake, making them an attractive contrast agent for disease studies. Lee et al.150 designed a bifunctional Fe3O4based nanoprobe for dual PET/MRI of tumor integrin αVβ3 expression. The proposed nanoconstruct had a chelating moiety (DOTA) on the surface for 64Cu labeling as PET detection motif and a Fe3O4 core for MRI. Successful conjugation of this NP to the integrin αVβ3-binding RGD peptide yielded a tumor-specific probe for multimodality imaging as confirmed by both PET and MRI. In another study by Yang and co-workers,151 an anticancer drug was conjugated onto the PEGylated Fe3O4 nanocarriers via pH-sensitive bonds. c(RGDfC) peptides as the tumor-targeting ligands and macrocyclic 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N, N0, N00-triacetic acid (NOTA) as the PET 64Cu chelator were conjugated onto the distal ends of the PEG arms. The cRGD-conjugated Fe3O4 nanocarriers showed a much higher level of tumor accumulation than cRGD-free ones according to non-invasive and quantitative PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies. Thus, these magnetic nanocarriers demonstrated promising properties for combined targeted anticancer drug delivery and PET/MRI dual-modality imaging of tumors. Yang et al.114\nused the NOTA macrocyclic ligand for Au-Fe3O4 surface functionalization with 64Cu and affibody conjugation. A chelator free strategy was applied by Wong and co-workers152 for production of 64Cu-doped Fe3O4 NPs with a dextran coating. This method demonstrated the successful incorporation of 64Cu into these nanoparticles with the aim of future use for dual-mode MR/PET imaging.\nRadiolabeling of Fe3O4 NPs with 68Ga and 111In has been described in some cases. Using 68Ga and 111In, the radiolabeling of magnetic NPs can easily be done without the need of a chelating agent. 68Ga has the advantage of being\nFIGURE 7. (A) Schematic illustration of the multi-functional HSA-Fe3O4 and (B) ex vivo PET imaging on tumor and the major organs; Reprinted by permission of Elsevier Publishers.\nJOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A | JAN 2019 VOL 107A, ISSUE 1 265\nREVIEW ARTICLE\nrelatively easy to synthesize using a 68Ge-/68Ga generator. However, a major disadvantage is its relatively short half-life (approximately 1.13 h), which limiting its use for in vivo cell trafficking by PET. 111In with its longer half-life (2.8 days) would be more suitable to answer the question of the “fate” of cells after in vivo application, but it is limited to the use of the less sensitive PET. A study by Madru et al. showed that 68Ga can be attached to Fe3O4 NPs with direct labeling method.153 Lahooti and co-workers154 also proposed PEGylated superparamagnetic Fe3O4 NPs labeled with\n68Ga (chelator-free) as a PET/MRI contrast agent. They evaluated the biodistribution of 68Ga-PEG-Fe3O4 NPs in the normal mice after intravenous administration of this probe. The biodistribution data revealed high uptake by liver and spleen. The clearance of other organs was fast. These results suggested that 68Ga-PEG-NPs has magnificent capabilities for applying in (PET-MRI) as a theranostic agent for detection of liver and spleen malignancies. Stelter and co-workers155 reported the radiolabeling of fluorescein isothiocyanate modified superparamagnetic NPs with 68Ga and 111In for in vivo and in vitro applications, respectively. They concluded that modified superparamagnetic NPs are stable under in vitro and in vivo conditions and are therefore applicable to efficient cell labeling and subsequent multimodal molecular imaging. Kim et al.156 designed a dual-modality tumor-targeting agent with a new tumor-targeting molecule, oleanolic acid (OA), which is derived from a natural compound and coupled with a macrocyclic chelating agent such as NOTA, Fe3O4 NPs and radiolabeling components such as 68Ga for dual-modality PET/MRI. They also obtained fusion PET/MR images with the 68Ga-NOTA-OA-Fe3O4 nanohybrid using colon cancer (HT-29) xenograft mice models. The HT-cancer cells showed high uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-OA-Fe3O4, which also had an inhibitory effect on the cells. Zolata et al.157 developed bioprobes by 111In-labeled Trastuzumab Ab-doxorubicin (DOX) conjugated APTES-PEG coated Fe3O4 NPs for tumor SPECT/ MR imaging. To increase NP circulation time in blood and decrease its cytotoxicity in healthy tissues, Fe3O4 NPs surface was modified with APTES and then were functionalized with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester of PEG maleimide (NHS-PEG-Mal) to conjugate with thiolated 3,6,9,15-tetraazabicyclo[9.3.1]pentadeca-1(15),11,13-triene3,6,9,-triacetic acid (PCTA) bifunctional chelator and Trastuzumab Ab. Active and passive tumor targeting were achieved through incorporated Trastuzumab Ab and EPR effect of solid tumors for NPs, respectively. In addition to in vitro assessments of modified magnetic NPs in SKBR3 cell lines, their theranostic effects were evaluated in HER2 positive breast tumor bearing BALB/c mice via biodistribution study, dual-modal molecular imaging and tumor diameter measurements. Wang et al.158 prepared Fe3O4 NPs stabilized by oleic acid and phospholipids which were further radiolabeled with 59Fe, 14C-oleic acid and 111In. Mouse biodistributions showed 111In preferentially localized in reticuloendothelial organs, liver, spleen, and bone. However, there were greater levels of 59Fe than 111In in liver and spleen, but lower levels of 14C.\nThe most commonly used radionuclide in SPECT/MRI is 99mTc because of its excellent physical properties and\nextended availability through 99Mo/99mTc generators. It has been shown by many scientific groups that in vivo administration of 99mTc-radiolabeled NPs can provide accurate biodistribution profiles and visualization of excretion route of radioactivity in vivo for a period of up to 24 h. In recent years, an increased interest for 99mTc conjugated Fe3O4 NPs has prompted researchers to design radiopharmaceuticals in SPECT/MRI dual-modality tumor imaging. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) is defined as the first regional lymph node receiving lymphatic drainage from a malignant tumor and the first node to which metastatic cells are likely to anchor. Therefore, the accurate detection and characterization of the SLN is of major importance for cancer staging and for the choice of therapy in these patients. Madru et al.159 proposed labeled superparamagnetic NPs for multimodality SPECT/ MRI of sentinel lymph nodes. In this protocol, the accumulation of 99mTc-Fe3O4 NPs in lymph nodes after subcutaneous injection in animals was verified by SPECT/MRI. de Rosales and co-workers160 introduced a new class of dual-modality imaging agents based on the conjugation of radiolabeled bisphosphonates (BP) directly to the surface of superparamagnetic Fe3O4 NPs. They demonstrated the high potential of BP-Fe3O4 NPs conjugation using\n99mTc-dipicolylamine (DPA)-alendronate, a BP-SPECT agent, and Endorem/Feridex, a liver MRI contrast agent for dual-modality biomedical imaging. The BP molecules conjugated to the iron oxide surface were significantly smaller than the dextran polymer units, suggesting that the latter will dominate the surface properties of 99mTc-DPA-ale-Endorem and hence its biodistribution. The whole-body nanoSPECT-CT showed the accumulation of 99mTc-DPA-ale-Endorem in the liver and spleen [Fig. 8(a)]. Notably, no uptake was detected in bone tissue, which is the target of 99mTc-DPA-ale when not bound to BPFe3O4 NPs [Fig. 8(b)], confirming that\n99mTc-DPA-ale and Endorem colocalize and, hence, the in vivo stability of the BP-Endorem bond. The obtained results demonstrated that the BP group is a promising candidate for the simple functionalization of metal oxide nanomaterials with radionuclides, targeting molecules and stability/stealth groups for targeted radionuclide-based dual-modality medical imaging. In another study reported by Psimadas et al...,161 monodisperse and stable CoFe2O4 NPs were produced, coated, and further stabilized using ethyl 12-(hydroxyamino)-12-oxododecanoate, PLGA and BSA. The final product, NBRh1, was fully characterized and radiolabeled with 99mTc using SnCl2 as the reducing agent in high yields. The planar and SPECT imaging data as well as the biodistribution results were in accordance, showing high liver and spleen uptake as expected starting almost immediately after administration. Radiolabeling of NBRh1 with 99mTc comprised an effective technique for their in vivo mapping and quantification. Tsiapa and co-workers,162 developed an aminosilane-coated Fe3O4 as a tumor imaging agent in nuclear medicine through APTES functionalization. They used this multimeric system of targeted 99mTc-labeled NPs conjugated with a new RGD derivative (cRGDfK-Orn3-CGG), characterized as NPs-RGD for molecular imaging of amb3 expression in tumor angiogenesis. The findings indicated that RGD peptide, conjugated on"

This specific uptake in combination with hyperthermia could hopefully provide an effective system for cancer therapy and diagnosis. 99mTc radiolabeling of Fe3O4-Au core-shell and Au-Fe3O4 dumbbell-like nanoparticles was done by Felber and Alberto.163 For this purpose, Fe3O4-Au core–shell NPs were labeled using the direct approach, in which the gold surface was coated with bifunctional ligands, consisting of an anchor for the metal surface and chelators for the [99mTc(CO)3] + moiety. In addition, Au-Fe3O4 dumbbell-like NPs were radiolabeled via a prelabeling strategy; 99mTc complexes were synthesized first and then coated on the gold surface. Both approaches resulted in average to good radiochemical yields.\n18F has additional advantages over 64Cu such as higher sensitivity, shorter half-life, and the ability of irreversible covalent bonding. Despite these advantages, the addition of 18F to functionally complex materials is chemically challenging and is a major reason for the absence of reports of 18F iron NPs. Devaraj et al164 reported 18F labeled trimodal NPs for in vivo PET-CT Imaging. This particle consisted of crosslinked dextran held together in core–shell formation by a superparamagnetic Fe3O4 core and functionalized with the radionuclide 18F in high yield via “click” chemistry. The presence of 18F dramatically decreased the detection threshold of the NPs, while the facile conjugation chemistry provided a simple platform for rapid and efficient NP labeling. Another strategy for modifying the surface of upconversion nanophosphors via rare earth cation-assisted ligand assembly was developed by Liu and co-workers,165 which imparts them with excellent upconversion luminescence properties, MR, radioactivity, targeted function, and water and biocompatibility, thereby making these NPs a potential candidate for multimodal bioimaging. This strategy opened up new\nperspectives for the preparation of uniform nanoprobes for multimodal bioimaging application from the cellular scale to whole-body evaluation.\nAs previously mentioned, the invasion status of tumordraining lymph nodes is a critical indicator of cancer stage and is important for treatment planning. Clinicians currently use planar scintigraphy and SPECT with 99mTc-radiocolloid to guide biopsy and resection of lymph nodes. Thorek et al.166 presented a multimodal NP, 89Zr-ferumoxytol, for the enhanced detection of lymph nodes with PET/MRI. Feraheme (ferumoxytol) is a FDA approved drug for treating anemia and in multi-center clinical trials as an MRI contrast agent. It is a carbohydrate-coated, superparamagnetic iron oxide NP. They radiolabeled ferumoxytol nanoparticles with 89Zr via a DFO chelate covalently bound to the carboxymethyl dextran coating. In a similar study, a novel reaction for chelate-free, heat-induced 89Zr binding for radiolabeling of ferumoxytol was established by Boros et al.167 The chemistry is applicable to a wide range of p-, d-, and f-block metal nuclides. Radiolabeling studies showed that 89Zr-ferumoxytol is thermodynamically and kinetically stable in vitro in a series of ligand challenge and plasma stability tests. In addition, the results suggested that radiolabeled ferumoxytol have the potential to be used in hybrid PET/MRI, SPECT/ MRI, and/or radiotherapeutic applications in vivo.\nUsing anti-VEGF mAb and magnetic NPs as double targeting vector for the radioimmunotherapy of liver cancer was suggested by Chen et al.168 For this purpose, a new radioimmunoconjugate-131I-anti-VEGF Ab (Sc-7269)-dextranFe3O4 NPs was prepared. Then, tumor growth delay (TGD) and tumor inhibition rate were observed as antitumor effect. Peripheral white blood cells counts and the loss of body weight were tested as an indicator of systemic toxicity. The results indicated that the radioimmunotherapy of\nJOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A | JAN 2019 VOL 107A, ISSUE 1 267\nREVIEW ARTICLE\nintratumoral injection of 131I–Sc-7269– Fe3O4 NPs may be safe and efficient for the treatment of liver cancer. Deng et al.169 also showed that the radioactive iodine therapy using Fe3O4 NPs carrier system may be a highly potential approach in the treatment of other kind of tumors. They proposed radiolabeled RGD-conjugated Fe3O4 NPs as the SPECT and MRI dual-modality agents for imaging of breast cancer.\nCarbon-11 (11C) radiotracers are widely used for the early diagnosis of cancer, monitoring therapeutic response to cancer treatment and pharmacokinetic investigations of anticancer drugs.170 The short half-life of 11C (20.38 min) creates special challenges for the synthesis of 11C-labeled tracers; these include the challenges of synthesizing 11C target compounds with high radiochemical yield, high radiochemical purity and high specific activity in a short time and on a very small scale. However, advances in organic synthetic chemistry and radiochemistry as well as improved automated techniques for radiosynthesis have encouraged investigators in developing 11C tracers for use in PET imaging studies. For example, 11C in the form of [11C]methyl iodide was used as a methylation agent to react with carboxylic acid and amine functional groups of ligands bound to Fe3O4 NPs.\n171 The surface coating ligands present on superparamagnetic NPs were radiolabeled to achieve dualmodality PET/MR imaging capabilities. The proof-of-concept dual-modality PET/MR imaging using the radiolabeled magnetic NPs was demonstrated in an in vivo experiment. Another isotope, carbon-14 (14C, β emitter), is useful in studying abnormalities of metabolism that underlie diabetes, gout, anemia, and acromegaly. Nallathamby and coworkers172 reported the incorporation of 14C into the magnetic NPs conjugated carboxylate functional groups for biodistribution studies. The Fe3O4 NPs were first silanized with N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl] ethylenediamine (Si-diamine) and designated as Fe-Si-diamine. Then, each functional diamine group reacted to undergo a substitution reaction to incorporate a total of three CH2COO\n− groups per organic silane. The obtained NPs were radiolabeled by incorporating 14C directly into the carbon backbone of the organic molecules on the surface of the NPs. The radiolabeled Fe Si (COO−)3 NPs were designated as\n14C Fe Si (COO−)3 NPs. This protocol combined with the biodistribution data suggested that the presented radiolabeling schemes have broad implications for use in pharmacokinetic studies for a variety of nanomaterials.\nShanehsazzadeh and co-workers173 described the preparation and biodistribution of 177Lu-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-Fe3O4 NPs after intravenous injection in rats. The chelator DTPA dianhydride was conjugated to Fe3O4 NPs using a small modification of the well-known cyclic anhydride method. The biodistribution of 177Lu-DTPA-Fe3O4 NPs in rats showed dramatic uptake in the RES and their clearance is so fast in other organs especially in the blood. They suggested that this radiotracer would be suitable for RES studies, because of high uptakes of this radiotracer in the liver and spleen and their fast clearance from other tissues, especially in blood.\nGermanium-69 (69Ge) is a novel positron emitting radionuclide whose potential is yet to be explored for PET imaging.\nThe adequately long half-life of 69Ge, makes it an ideal choice for immuno-PET imaging using 69Ge-labeled antibodies. Also, the production route of this radioisotope is simple and costeffective. However, the major limitation in the use of this novel radioisotope is its complex coordination chemistry in aqueous medium and the unavailability of suitable radiolabeling techniques for the preparation of 69Ge-based radiopharmaceuticals. It has been reported that the predominant germanium species in aqueous media are Ge(OH)4, [GeO(OH)3] −, [GeO2(OH)2] 2−, and [[Ge(OH)4]8(OH)3] 3− with the distribution of each species being dependent on the total concentration and the pH of the medium, making it a major challenge for radiolabeling with 69Ge using traditional chelator-based methods.174 Chakravarty et al.174 carried out radiolabeling of Fe3O4 NPs@ poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) with 69Ge by adjusting the pH of the 69Ge solution to about 7, not only to maintain the stability of 69Ge-Fe3O4 NPs@PAA but also to achieve the best labeling efficiency. The biodistribution pattern of 69Ge-Fe3O4 NPs@PAA for in vivo dual-modality imaging and lymph-node mapping has also been investigated. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first example on the successful utilization of 69Ge-based agent for PET/MR imaging.\nOwing to its ideally suited nuclear decay properties and availability in adequate quantity at an affordable cost, 166Ho is an attractive choice for treatment of arthritis of knee joints. Recently, the production of 166Ho in nuclear reactors and development of a radiochemical formulation for radiation synovectomy using highly agglomerated Fe3O4 NPs having 1–10 μm size range have been reported by Vimalnath et al.175 The reported agent could emerge as a potential radiochemical formulation potential material for treatment of arthritis of knee joints.\nRadium-223 (223Ra) is a first-in-class alpha-emitting radionuclide approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for the treatment of bone metastases originating from castration resistant prostate cancer.176 However, the data published on the 223Ra labeled magnetic NPs in theranostic applications is quite limited. Mokhodoeva and co-workers176 focused on the study of 223Ra uptake mechanism by Fe3O4 NPs. In addition, they discussed the potential use of 223Ra labeled supermagnetic NPs in theranostic applications. They found that the process of 223Ra uptake by Fe3O4 NPs corresponds well with the sorption and surface complexation, rather than the precipitation mechanism. Their data also indicated that the initial and relatively moderate 223Ra uptake on the surface (edge-sites) was subsequently followed by a slower process of 223Ra incorporation into interstitial positions of Fe3O4 NPs (layer sites). This fact would influence further NPs labeling strategies with alpha emitters. Prospective in vivo application of labeled Fe3O4 NPs for theranostic purposes would benefit from their tunable size and the magnetic properties that would be the key parameter for effective targeting and dosedelivery to selected tissues. Another important benefit is the possibility of Fe3O4 NPs shell-encapsulation and further active targeting by the attachment of biological vectors.\nAbsorbed doses to human organs from 188Re-rituximab in the free form and bound to superparamagnetic NPs were"

Azadbakht et al.177 reported that equivalent and effective doses to human organs from the radiopharmaceutical on the NPs are higher because of the EPR effect. Liver, spleen, and kidneys received higher equivalent doses than other organs.\nNanoclusters. Recently, noble metal NCs (such as gold NCs [AuNCs]), have aroused great interest in the development of new types of radiolabeled nanocarriers. This is mainly because of their nontoxicity, excellent biocompatibility, and water solubility. More importantly, these NCs are usually prepared by a biomimetic synthesis method using naturally functional macromolecules (proteins, peptides, and enzymes) as templates, which provides the NCs with good colloidal stability and solubility in biological systems and avoid them from undesired or nonspecific binding. Meanwhile, the macromolecules provide bioactive functional groups which can be used for further surface functionalization. Hu and coworkers178 reported a novel design of nontoxic selfilluminating gold NC (64Cu-doped AuNCs) for dual-modality PET and NIF imaging based on Cerenkov resonance energy transfer (CRET). PET radionuclide 64Cu was introduced by a chelator-free doping method, which played dual roles as the energy donor and the PET imaging source. 64Cu-doped AuNCs exhibited efficient CRET-NIR and PET imaging both in vitro and in vivo. In a U87MG glioblastoma xenograft model, 64Cu-doped AuNCs showed high tumor uptake and produced satisfactory tumor self-illuminating NIR images in the absence of external excitation. This self-illuminating NC with nontoxicity and good biocompatibility was used as a novel imaging contrast agent for biomedical applications, especially for molecular imaging. Zhao et al.179 also reported the preparation of 64Cu alloyed Au NCs (64CuAuNCs) for in vivo evaluation of pharmacokinetics, systemic clearance, and PET imaging in a mouse prostate cancer model. PET/CT imaging showed low non-specific tumor uptake and heterogeneous intratumoral distribution, indicating its potential for active targeting of clinically relevant biomarkers in tumor and metastatic organs.\nQuantum dots. Development of QD-based nanocarriers for radionuclides has become a hot spot in the fields of nanoradiopharmaceuticals research in recent years. QDs can help realize the targeting of radiopharmaceuticals and improve their bioavailability in biological fields. A QD-based nanocarrier system for radiopharmaceuticals has the potential to realize early detection, to monitor and to localize treatments of specific disease sites. In addition, QD nanocarrier systems can improve the stability of radiopharmaceuticals, lengthen circulation time in vivo, enhance targeted absorption and improve the distribution and metabolism process of radiopharmaceuticals in organization. As QDs are ideal agents for multiplexed fluorescence imaging, combination of the multiplexing capabilities of both SPECT and QDs can enable the interrogation of a number of biological events simultaneously using molecularly targeted QDs. QDs possess many advantages over organic fluorophores, such as size and\ncomposition-tunable fluorescence emission, large absorption across a wide spectral range, narrow emission spectra and very high levels of brightness and photostability.180 The commonly used approach to generate QD-based dual modality agents for optical and PET/SEPCT imaging applications is through direct/indirect labeling of QDs with radioisotopes. However, the stability of the radiolabel in living animals is not very high.181 For example, a few hours after intravenous injection of 64Cu-labeled QDs into mice, the PET and fluorescence imaging data were in good agreement with each other.182 However, distribution of 64Cu (measured by PET) and the QDs (detected by optical imaging) was substantially different at late time points. Incorporation of the radionuclide inside the QDs eliminated the concerns regarding in vivo stability of the radiolabel relative to the QDs, because it has been well documented that QDs do not undergo significant degradation unless they are subjected to very harsh conditions,181 which is largely irrelevant to the in vivo environment. The current trend for generating more biocompatible QDs-based nanocarrier is in the use of other less toxic materials such as InP,181 which can alleviate the concerns regarding the long-term toxicity of Cd and Te.\nIn this section, we review some examples of the QDbased nanocarriers for radiopharmaceuticals in biological fields. Cai et al.183 introduced an amine functionalized CdTe QD modified with RGD peptides and DOTA chelator for integrin αVβ3-targeted PET/NIF imaging. For this purpose, QD-based nanocarrier was radiolabeled with 64Cu and the probe uptake in the tumor and major organs was quantified. The characterization of the final product confirmed that there are about 90 RGD peptides per QD particle and DOTAQD-RGD exhibits αVβ3-specific binding in cell cultures. The U87MG tumor uptake of 64Cu-labeled DOTA-QD was <1% of injected dose per gram (%ID/g), significantly lower than that of 64Cu-labeled DOTA-QD-RGD. Taking into account all measurements, the liver-, sleen- and kidney-to-muscle ratios for 64Cu-labeled DOTA-QD-RGD were about 100:1, 40:1, and 1:1, respectively. This dual-function probe has significantly reduced potential toxicity and overcomes the tissue penetration limitation of optical imaging, allowing for quantitative targeted imaging in deep tissue. In another study by Chen and co-workers,184 an amine-functionalized CdTe QD was conjugated with VEGF protein and DOTA chelator for VEGFR-targeted PET/NIF imaging after 64Cu-labeling. The targeting efficacy of this dual-functional probe was evaluated in vitro and in vivo through cell-binding assay, cell staining, in vivo optical/PET imaging, ex vivo optical/PET imaging, and histology. The U87MG tumor uptake of 64Cu-labeled DOTA-QD was <1 %ID/g, significantly lower than that of 64Cu-labeled DOTA-QD-VEGF [Fig. 9(a)]. Both NIF imaging and microPET showed VEGFR-specific delivery of conjugated DOTA-QD-VEGF NP and prominent RES uptake [Fig. 9(b,c)]. Duconge et al.185 designed a novel multimodal imaging probe based on a [18F]-labeled QD phospholipid micelle. For this purpose, CdSe nanocrystal cores were synthesized and coated by CdZnS shell. The core–shell QDs were encapsulated in PEG-phospholipid micelles. The biodistribution of the [18F]-QDs was then followed in vivo in mice using PET\nJOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A | JAN 2019 VOL 107A, ISSUE 1 269\nREVIEW ARTICLE\nand ex vivo using fluorescence microscopy. The results showed that these phospholipids QD micelles are well distributed throughout the body and exhibit long circulation times and, as expected for NPs, slow uptake by the RES. These properties could stand in favor of the further development of QDs for some in vivo imaging applications. In different strategies, direct labeling of QDs was carried out for conjugation of radionuclides to these nanocarriers. For example, Sun and co-workers186 prepared a self-illuminating QD system by doping 64Cu into CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs via a cation-exchange reaction. The signal of 64Cu accurately reflected the biodistribution of the QDs during circulation with no dissociation of 64Cu from the nanocarriers. They also explored this system for in vivo tumor imaging. This nanoprobe showed high tumor targeting ability in a U87MG glioblastoma xenograft model and feasibility for in vivo luminescence imaging of tumor in the absence of excitation light. The availability of these self-illuminating integrated QDs provided an accurate and convenient tool for in vivo tumor imaging and detection. In another chelator-free study by Fazaeli et al.,187 CdTe QDs were labeled with 68Ga radio nuclide for fast in vivo targeting and coincidence imaging of tumors. The physicochemical properties of the QDs labeled with 68Ga were found high enough stable in human serum. In vivo biodistribution of the 68Ga@CdTe QDs, nanoconposite was investigated in rats bearing fibro sarcoma tumor after various postinjection periods of time. The 68Ga@CdTe QDs exhibited a rapid as well as high tumor uptake in a very short period of time (<10 min), resulting in an efficient tumor targeting/imaging agent. Because of the short half-life of 68Ga radionuclide, the 68Ga@CdTe QDs with an excellent tumor targeting/imaging and fast washing out from the body can be suggested as one of the most effective and promising nanomaterials in nanotechnology-based cancer diagnosis and therapy."

This class of nanomaterials is being investigated as delivery platforms for diagnostic and therapeutic radionuclides to target disease. Nanorods. Among the different forms of the gold nanostructures, rod-shaped nanostructures that are the so-called as gold nanorods (AuNRs) present unique properties. They show two distinctive transverse and longitudinal surface plasmon in the visible (~520 nm) and the near-infrared (~900 nm) regions. The near-infrared region (650–900 nm) is ideally suited for in vivo imaging and therapy because of the minimum light absorption by intrinsic chromophores, hemoglobin (<650 nm) and water molecules (>900 nm) and the maximum penetration of light into tissues, as a consequence.188 In addition to the aforementioned optical properties, the surface chemistry of the AuNRs allows their multiple functionalization of them by various pharmaceutical agents. Capping molecules, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), can be substituted or conjugated with many functional groups. PEG-modified AuNRs show a nearly neutral surface and has little in vivo cytotoxicity. In addition, PEG can shield nanorods from fouling by serum proteins and reduce the possibility of adsorption of reticuloendothelial factors of the blood on the surface of nanorod. This in turn reduces the rate of clearance of nanorods by cells of the monophagocytic system and creates long-circulating NPs whit a high in vivo utilization level. Recently, an interest has grown in application of medical radionuclides in the study of in vivo distribution of nanorods. The current study focuses on the preparation of radiolabeled AuNRs and investigation of their in vivo distribution."

The obtained results showed prominent uptake of 131I-PEG-AuNRs in the blood after intravenous administration that show the 131I-PEGylated nanorod as a whole particle is hardly sequestered on the gland-type organs and they rather tend to stay in the blood, but uptakes of the Na131I were chiefly observed in the thyroid and stomach. One of the causes of high blood retention of 131I-PEG-AuNRs was modification of the nanorods surface with PEG that delays the recognition and uptake of radio conjugates by the RES and influences the biodistribution profile and the clearance kinetics. The PEG-coated AuNRs remained in the blood pool for a much longer period. However, at long-term, the accumulation in liver and spleen declined most drastically. In addition, this protocol showed that 131I-PEG-AuNRs are extraordinary stable at in vivo condition. Zhang and coworkers190 prepared 131I-labeled AuNRs conjugated with cyclic RGD and evaluated its biological characteristics for targeted imaging of integrin αVβ3-expressing tumors. The [131I] AuNR-PEG-cRGD probe targeted selectively and could be taken up by tumor cells mainly via integrin αVβ3-receptor mediated endocytosis. In vivo imaging, the biodistribution and autoradiography results showed evident tumor uptake in integrin αVβ3-expressing tumors. For better examination of inflammation, Shao et al.191 designed inflammationtargeted nuclear andoptical dual-modality contrast agents prepared by 125I radiolabeling of AuNRs conjugated with anti-intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) Ab. The success in targeted delivery of AuNRs to inflammatory tissue enabled both nuclear and optical imaging of inflammation at molecular or cellular level.\nNanotubes. A nanotube is a nanometer-scale tube-like structure. The first nanotubes to be discovered were carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Carbon nanotubes consist exclusively of carbon atoms arranged in a series of condensed benzene rings rolled-up into a tubular structure. This novel nanomaterial belongs to the family of fullerenes, the third allotropic form of carbon along with graphite and diamond. CNTs can be classified into two general categories, based on their structure: single-walled (SWNT), which consist of one layer of cylinder graphene and multi-walled (MWNT), which contain several concentric graphene sheets. CNT have nanometric dimensions: SWNT have diameters from 0.4 to 2.0 nm and lengths in the range of 20–1000 nm, whereas MWNT are bigger objects with diameters in the range of 1.4–100 nm and lengths from 1 to several μm.192\nClinical applications of CNTs are offering a great number of opportunities. Functionalization renders the surface of CNTs water-soluble, compatible with biological fluids and leads to their rapid excretion through the renal route, minimizing unwanted tissue accumulation.192 A key CNT property that is utilized extensively is rapid blood compartment clearance.193 To date, the various in vivo studies have been published, which demonstrate the potential of CNTs in helping to improve the characteristics of known therapeutics, especially in nuclear nanomedicine. In recent years, the door of opportunity for the development of CNTs as nanocarriers for diagnostic andtherapeutic redionuclides has opened, and systematic study of their therapeutic efficacy is anticipated. For example, McDevittand co-workers194 synthesized 86YCNT construct from amine-functionalized, water-soluble CNT by covalently attaching multiple copies of DOTA chelates and then radiolabeled with the positron-emitting metal-ion, yttrium-86. The whole-body distribution and clearance of 86Y were characterized at 3 and 24 h postinjection using PET. The yttrium-86 cleared the blood within 3 h and distributed predominantly to the kidneys, liver, spleen, and bone. Although the activity that accumulated in the kidney cleared with time, the whole-body clearance was slow. Blood clearance was rapid and could be beneficial in the use of short-lived radionuclides in diagnostic applications. In another research by Ruggiero et al.,193 SWCNT constructs were covalently appended with radiometal-ion chelates DOTA or DFO and the tumor neovascular-targeting antibody E4G10. The E4G10 Ab specifically targeted the monomeric vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cad) epitope expressed in the tumor angiogenic vessels. The obtained product was radiolabeled with 225Ac and 89Zr. They performed targeted radioimmuno therapy with a SWCNT-([225Ac]DOTA)(E4G10) construct directed at the tumor vasculature in a murine xenograft model of human colon adenocarcinoma (LS174T). They also performed PET radioimmunoimaging of the tumor vessels with a SWCNT-([89Zr]DFO)(E4G10) construct in the same murine LS174T xenograft model and compared the results to appropriate controls. The obtained data have implications that support further imaging and radiotherapy studies using a SWCNT-based platform and focusing on the tumor vessels as the target. The delivery property of CNTs, high tumor binding avidity of folic acid (FA), anticancer or chemo-therapeutic agent (methotrexate [MTX]), optical detectability of AF fluorochromes and radiotraceability of 99mTc could be successfully integrated and partitioned on a single CNT-platform by Das and co-workers.195 Specifically, MTX was conjugated to MWCNTs via a serum-stable yet intracellularly hydrolysable ester linkage to ensure minimum drug loss in circulation. Czarny et al.196 reported a method for quantitative analysis of the tissue biodistribution of MWCNTs as a function of time. The proposed method relay on the use of in situ 14C-radiolabeled MWCNTs and combined radioimaging of organ tissue sections to ex vivo analysis of MWCNTs by electron microscopy. To illustrate the usefulness of this approach, mice were exposed to a single dose of 14C-labeled MWCNTs by pharyngeal aspiration and were subjected to a follow-up study more than 1 year. After administration, MWCNTs were cleared from the lungs, but there was a concomitant relocation of these nanocomposites to distant organs starting throughout the follow-up period, with NP accumulation increasing with time. After 1 year, accumulation of MWCNTs was documented in several organs, including notably the white pulp of the spleen and the bone marrow. The proposed method may be useful to\nJOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A | JAN 2019 VOL 107A, ISSUE 1 271\nREVIEW ARTICLE\ncomplement other approaches to address unresolved toxicological issues associated with CNTs."

      "text" : "2D nanocarriers, designed as imaging agents, play an important role in biomedical research for the study of biological processes and transport mechanisms, as well as in clinical medicine for early and accurate disease detection. In this section, the 2D nanocarriers for labeling of radionuclides have been reviewed.\nNanosheets. Nanosheets provide 2D media to develop materials chemistry in broad fields including electronics, photonics, environmental science, and biology. A typical example of a nanosheet is graphene, the thinnest 2D material (0.34 nm) in the world. It consists of a single layer of carbon atoms with hexagonal lattices. Graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) are known as the derivatives of graphene. GO is prepared using improved Hummer’s method, whereas the produced GO is subjected to chemical reduction with the use of chemical or electrochemical reduction.23,197 Graphite, GO, and RGO have different morphologies, quality, functionalized groups, UV–Vis absorption peaks, and crystallinity. With the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups during reduction of GO, the quality of samples is decreased because of higher intensity of D band than G band in Raman spectrum.197 The G band is related to the E2gvibration mode of sp2 carbon and domains can be used to explain the degree of graphitization, whereas the D band is associated with structural defects and partially disordered structures of the sp2 domains. However, both GO and RGO with high drug-loading efficiency possess great potential in nanomedical applications. The graphene-based nanocomposites exhibit good biocompatibility, excellent photothermal performance, high drug loading capacity, an outstanding sustained release property and efficient endocytosis.\nRecently, radiolabeled graphene with ultra-high surface area has been used as a nanocarrier for loading and delivery of various radionuclides. In vivo applications of graphene for cancer therapy have been further explored, with encouraging therapeutic effects in animal models.198 For example, Hong et al.199 investigated the In vivo behavior of covalently functionalized GO conjugates in the 4 T1 tumor model with 66Gabased PET imaging. For this purpose, GO nanosheets with covalently linked, amino group-terminated six-arm branched PEG chains were conjugated to NOTA and TRC105 (an antibody that binds to CD105). The TRC105-conjugated GO was specific for CD105 in cell culture. The CD105 antigen (endoglin) as a homodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein is a co-receptor for the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Both CD105 and TGF-β are expressed at low levels in resting endothelial cells, but they are overexpressed in cancerous lesions and play a significantly proangiogenic role in remodeling the vasculature of malignant tumors. 66Ga-NOTA-GOTRC105 and 66Ga-NOTA-GO exhibited excellent stability in complete mouse serum. In 4 T1 tumor-bearing mice, these GO conjugates were primarily cleared through the hepatobiliary pathway. Successful demonstration of in vivo tumor\ntargeting with GO, along with the versatile chemistry of graphene-based nanomaterials, makes them suitable nanoplatforms for future biomedical research such as cancer theranostics. In another study by Fazaeli and co-workers,200 GO nanosheets were hybridized with Fe3O4 NPs to form magnetic GO and were further labeled by [68Ga]GaCl3 as a potential drug delivery system. Biological evaluations of the prepared nanocomposite were performed in normal Sprague Dawley rats and it was found to be a possible host for theranostic radiopharmaceuticals. The results showed that the grafting of Fe3O4 NPs on nanocomposite reduced the unwanted liver and spleen uptakes and increased the ratio of kidney/liver uptake, leading to the fast removal of radioactive agent and less imposed radiation to patients. Considering the accumulation of the tracer in vital organs of rat (especially brain), efficient iron oxide grafting, fast wash-out, the short half-life 68Ga and less imposed radiation doses to patients, this nanocomposite could be a suitable candidate for PET studies and imaging applications. Fazaeli et al.201 also developed GO nanosheets functionalized by aminopropylsilyl groups and labeled by 198Au and 199Au radioisotopes for the fast in vivo targeting and SPECT imaging of tumors. In vivo biodistribution of the 198,199Au@amino-functionalized (AF) GO composite was investigated in rats bearing fibrosarcoma tumor after various post-injection periods of time. The 198,199Au@AF-GO nanostructure exhibited a rapid and high tumor uptake that resulted in an efficient tumor targeting/ imaging. Meantime, the low lipophilicity of the 198,199Au@AFGO caused to its fast excretion (~24 h) throughout the body by the kidneys (as also confirmed by the urinary tract). Because of the short half-lives of 199Au and 199Au radioisotopes, the 198,199Au@AF-GO with an excellent tumor targeting/imaging and fast washing out from the body was suggested as one of the most effective and promising nanomaterials in nanotechnology-based cancer diagnosis and therapy. Chen et al.202 developed 131I labeled, PEG-coated RGO, obtaining 131I-RGO-PEG for nuclear imaging-guided combined radiotherapy and photothermal therapy of cancer. Compared with free 131I, 131I-RGO-PEG exhibited enhanced cellular uptake and thus improved the radio-therapeutic efficacy against cancer cells. As revealed by gamma imaging, efficient tumor accumulation of 131I-RGO-PEG was observed after its intravenous injection. Although RGO exhibited strong near-infrared (NIR) absorbance and could induce effective photothermal heating of tumor under NIR light irradiation, 131I was able to emit high-energy X-ray to induce cancer killing as the result of radio ionization effect. The proposed strategy demonstrated the great promise of combing nuclear medicine and photothermal therapy as a novel therapeutic strategy to realize synergistic efficacy in cancer treatment. The antibacterial activity of GO toward gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus was also investigated in vitro.203 Different parameters were used to study the GO labeling by 99mTc. Biodistribution studies in Swiss Albino rats were carried out in experimentally induced infection in the left lateral thigh using S. aureus. The biodistribution study revealed that the optimum accumulation of 99mTc-GO at the infection sites is at 60 min. In an interesting investigation by Shi et al.,204 64Cu was labeled onto"

As a result of abundant π bonds, RGO exhibited significantly higher labeling efficiency in comparison with GO and exhibited excellent radiostability in vivo. More importantly, nonspecific attachment of NOTA on nanographene was observed, which revealed that the chelator-mediated NPbased PET imaging has its inherent drawbacks and can possibly lead to erroneous imaging results in vivo. It is beneficial to try chelator-free labeling before conventional chelator-based labeling, which may uncover a novel labeling mechanism providing better labeling efficiency and stability.\nNanodisks. Nanodisk technology, developed by Sligar and coworkers, allows the researcher to use engineered nanodisks in biological applications.205 Nanodisks, engineered from human high density lipoprotein are disk-shaped phospholipid bilayers stabilized by two surrounding α-helical amphipathic membrane scaffold proteins (MSPs). The MSPs keep the nanodisks in their well-defined shape and size over a wide range of conditions including concentrations and temperatures. The nanodisk system has been designed and optimized to be a platform for studying membrane proteins. In these applications, the phospholipid bilayer offers a perfect environment for membrane proteins and stabilizes their natural conformation and function in a more native like state than more commonly used detergent-based systems.206 In addition, nanodisks have shown promising results for drug delivery usage. Huda and co-workers206 developed the PET/CT based in vivo evaluation of 64Cu-labeled nanodisks in tumor-bearing mice. 64Cu radiolabeled nanodisks based on the 11 α-helix MSP1E3D1 protein and 1-palmitoyl2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipids were, for the first time, followed in vivo by PET for evaluating the biodistribution of nanodisks. For the radiolabeling, a simple approach for 64Cu radiolabeling of proteins via a chelating agent, DOTA, was developed. A cancer tumor bearing mouse model was used for the investigations, and it was found that the approximately 13 nm nanodisks, because of their size, permeate deeply into cancer tissue. This makes them promising candidates for both drug delivery purposes and as advanced imaging agents."

      "text" : "Several studies support the role of 3D nanocarriers in improving radiopharmacy and highlight the need to liposomes in early phases of drug development. 3D porous scaffolds play an essential role by providing artificial extracellular matrices that mechanically and structurally support cellular activity. To this end, these scaffolds should be biocompatible, biodegradable without producing toxic byproducts, and nonimmunogenic, while exhibiting appropriate physicochemical, topographical, and mechanical properties. In view of the points just mentioned, this article addresses the most recent developments regarding the use of nanospheres for applications in imaging and therapy.\nNanospheres. The 3D nanospheres are closely related to nanoballs, but this second term is considerably lesser used in comparison with the first. During the last decade, the use of 3D nanospheres for biological applications has drawn increasing interest. Scaffolds comprising nanospheres display several advantages compared with traditional monolithic scaffolds that are related to an improved control over sustained delivery of imaging or therapeutic agents, signaling biomolecules and even pluripotent stem cells.\nGenerally, spherical biomaterials such as nanospheres should be made of biocompatible and biodegradable materials that do not release toxic degradation products. In addition, processing of these materials should be easy to enable production of nanospheres of the desired size and morphology. To meet with these requirements, polymeric, organic, and bioorganic nanospheres have been extensively investigated. In this section, we have categorized nanospheres for use in nuclear medicine by biomaterial class (polymer and bioorganic) and summarized the various strategies that use these nanospheres as functional nanocarriers for imaging and therapy. Polymeric nanospheres. Over the last decade, the medical community has made widespread use of synthetic polymeric and dendrimeric nanospheres to overcome biological barriers and enhance in vivo imaging, drug delivery, gene therapy, and tissue engineering.207 These applications are facilitated by the ability to easily tune the size, chemistry, topology, and ultimately, the properties of polymers through chemical synthesis. Multivalent carriers come in a variety of sizes and architectures and they can be carefully designed to amplify targeting of specific diseased tissues.\nDendrimers are hyperbranched polymeric nanospheres varying in their initiator core, repeating units, terminal functionality and charge and solubility profile. A drug can be entrapped either within the internal cavities or conjugated to peripheral functional groups of the dendrimer. PAMAM dendrimers are spherical macromolecules composed of repeating polyamidoamine units which are known to have low biological toxicity, good biocompatibility, and in vivo stability.208 The functional groups on the surface of these structurally well-defined PAMAM dendrimers, especially in their whole integer generations (i.e.,NH2 groups), allow for functionalization of these dendrimers with multiple modalities. Among many reported strategies, 9–15 N-acylation with NHS esters is a commonly used method for conjugation reactions with amine-terminated PAMAM dendrimers. PAMAM dendrimers have been labeled with different radioisotopes for biodistribution and pharmacokinetic studies. For example, Kobayashi and co-workers209 prepared the 111In and 88Ylabeled PAMAM conjugated with 2-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)6-methyl-diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (1B4M), a derivative of DTPA. In addition, they conjugated PAMAM1B4M to humanized anti-Tac IgG (HuTac) Ab and evaluated its in vitro and in vivo properties. They noted high accumulation in the liver, kidney, and spleen, which significantly decreased when the chelates were saturated with the stable element. A similar phenomenon was observed between unsaturated and saturated 111In-labeled HuTac-PAMAM-\nJOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A | JAN 2019 VOL 107A, ISSUE 1 273\nREVIEW ARTICLE\n1B4M, indicating that the PAMAM dendrimer had a detrimental effect on biodistribution. Amirkhanov et al.,210 imaged mutant KRAS2 mRNA activation in pancreatic cancer xenografts by PET based on a single radiometal, 64Cu, chelated to a 1,4,7,10-tetra(carboxymethylaza)cyclododecane (DOTA) chelator, connected via a flexible, hydrophilic spacer, aminoethoxyacetate (AEEA), to the N-terminus of a mutant KRAS2 peptide nucleic acid (PNA) hybridization probe. A peptide analogue of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), connected to a C-terminal AEEA, enabled receptor-mediated endocytosis. They hypothesized that a polydiamidopropanoyl (PDAP) dendrimer (generation m), with increasing numbers (n) of DOTA chelators, extended via a N-terminal AEEA from a mutant KRAS2 PNA with a C-terminal AEEA and IGF1 analogue could enable more intense external imaging of pancreatic cancer xenografts that overexpress IGF1 receptor and mutant KRAS2 mRNA. ([111In]DOTA-AEEA)n-PDAPmAEEA2-KRAS2 PNA-AEEA-IGF1 analogues were prepared and administered intravenously into immunocompromised mice bearing human AsPC1 (G12D) pancreatic cancer xenografts. These studies revealed that the synthesized nanocomposite permeated xenografts, entered cancer cells and accumulated in a sequence-specific manner. Almutairi and co-workers211 developed a modular multivalent core–shell architecture nanoprobe consisting of a biodegradable hetero bifunctional dendritic core chemoselectively functionalized with heterobifunctional polyethylene oxide (PEO) chains that form a protective shell, which imparts biological stealth and dictates the pharmacokinetics. Each of the eight branches of the dendritic core was functionalized for labeling with radiohalogens. Targeting peptides of cyclic RGD motifs were installed at the terminal ends of the PEO chains to enhance their accessibility to αVβ3-integrin receptors. This nanoscale design enabled a 50-fold enhancement of the binding affinity to αVβ3-integrin receptors with respect to the monovalent RGD peptide alone. Cell-based assays of the 125I-labeled dendritic nanoprobes using αVβ3 positive cells showed a sixfold increase in αVβ3 receptor-mediated endocytosis of the targeted nanoprobe compared with the nontargeted nanoprobe, whereas αVβ3 negative cells showed no enhancement of cell uptake over time. In vivo biodistribution studies of 76Brlabeled dendritic nanoprobes showed excellent bioavailability for the targeted and nontargeted nanoprobes. In vivo studies in a murine hindlimb ischemia model for angiogenesis revealed high-specific accumulation of 76Br-labeled dendritic nanoprobes targeted at αVβ3-integrins in angiogenic muscles, allowing highly selective imaging of this critically important process. In another study by Zhang et al.,212 acetylated (Ac) dendrimer PAMAM generation 5 (G5) reacted with folic acid (FA), followed by reacting with 2-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-6-methyl-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (1B4M DTPA) to form the conjugate of Ac-G5-FA-1B4M DTPA which was further radiolabeled with 99mTc. The radiochemical yield was up to 98.9% with excellent in vitro/ in vivo stability, rapid blood clearance and certain tumor accumulation which was further confirmed by micro-SPECT imaging study. Zhang et al.213 also showed that 99mTc-G5-AcpegFA-DTPA had much higher uptake in KB cancer cells and accumulated more in the tumor area than that of the other two conjugates. The uptake in KB cells depended on the incubation time. The results of in vivo biodistribution confirmed the data obtained from micro-SPECT imaging. These studies showed that PEGylation of PAMAM dendrimer folic acid conjugate improves the tumor targeting. Folateconjugated dendrimer maybe developed to be potential radiopharmaceuticals and targeted drug delivery systems. Seo and co-workers214 reported 64Cu-labeled LyP-1 (a 9-amino-acid cyclic peptide)-dendrimer for PET-CT imaging of atherosclerotic plaque. Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory vascular disease, is a high-risk factor for myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events. Enlarged plaque lesions constrict the luminal surface of the artery and hence reduce blood flow. Therefore, molecular imaging to monitor the progression of atherosclerosis can improve the management of patients and facilitate diagnosis. For this purpose, the (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-BAT(PET probe) was successfully synthesized and labeled with 64Cu and enhanced accumulation as compared with the monomeric peptide. This peptide recognizes tumor cells and macrophages by binding to the p32 protein on the cell surface. The radiolabeling of PAMAM dendrimers with 18F provides a very useful tool for biomedical studies involving tracing of the distribution of these interesting, molecularly defined polymers by PET imaging. In other work published by Zhou et al.,215 the electrostatic interactions were used to facilitate 18F radiolabeling PAMAM dendrimers. This highly efficient conjugation reaction benefits from a high, localized concentration of these NHS esters on the surface of PAMAM dendrimers, because of the electrostatic attraction between the anionic NHS esters and the positively charged PAMAM dendrimers. This novel strategy of utilizing electrostatic interactions provides a novel, facile, and efficient method for the conjugation and radiolabeling of PAMAM dendrimers that also has potential for radiolabeling other appropriate NPs. Mendoza-Nava and coworkers216 synthesize 177Lu-DOTA-dendrimer-folate-bombesin with AuNPs in the dendritic cavity (177Lu-DenAuNP-folatebombesin) and evaluated the radiopharmaceutical potential for targeted radiotherapy and the simultaneous detection of folate receptors (FRs) and gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPRs) overexpressed in T47D breast cancer cells. Preliminary binding studies in T47D breast cancer cells indicated a specific cell uptake and high retention in T47Dinduced tumors in mice. Bioorganic nanospheres. The first closed bilayer phospholipid systems, called liposomes, were described in 1965 and soon were proposed as drug delivery systems.217 Liposomes are self-assembling bioorganic nanospheres with an inner aqueous compartment surrounded by a phospholipidic bilayer. These carrier systems can encompass hydrophilic agents in the inner aqueous compartmentor/and lipophilic agents in the outer lipid membrane. In fact, these structures can deliver both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs for cancer, antibacterial, antifungal, immunomodulation, diagnostics, ophtalmica, vaccines, enzymes, and genetic elements. Liposomes have several favorable properties for molecular imaging, including high stability and the ability to be labeled with"

However, long circulation times and difficulties in creating targeted liposomes have proven challenges for imaging and therapy.218\nNanoliposomes, double-membrane lipid vesicles with a particle size from 10 nm to 100 nm, are important nanocarriers capable of packaging drugs in various drug delivery applications through the enhanced permeability and retention effect on leaky tumor sites. As both the inside and outside regions of nanoliposomes contain hydrophilic phosphoric end groups, various drugs or bioactive molecules could be encapsulated in the internal aqueous compartment of nanoliposomes and circulated in the blood and removed from the circulation by the RES after binding with opsonins. Nanoliposomes are generally labeled with radionuclides by conjugation to anchor-molecules present either in the internal aqueous cavity [e.g., deferoxamine (DF), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)] or incorporated into the lipid membrane [e.g., diethylene triamine penta acetic acid (DTPA)].219 The development of advanced imaging tools as PET and SPECT has tempted many research groups to exploit this medical progress in labeling liposomes with radionuclides for tumor imaging systems since the 1970s.219 Although a great number of reports have examined the utilization of radiolabeled liposomes for nuclear imaging of tumors, only a handful of papers addressed the possibility to use these liposomes for tumor radiotherapy. Emmetiere et al.,218 developed a strategy for bio-orthogonal conjugation, the reaction between tetrazines and transcyclooctenes. By coating radiolabeled liposomes with transcyclooctene and pretargeting with a tetrazine coupled to a targeted peptide, they were able to selectively enhance the retention of liposomes and bind them to tumor tissue in live animals. The rapid reaction between tetrazines and transcyclooctenes allowed imaging to be performed with the short-lived PET tracer 18F. Because of low ion permeability of lipid bilayers, it is common practice to use transporter molecules such as ionophores or lipophilic chelators to increase transmembrane diffusion rates and loading efficiencies of radionuclides into liposomes. Over the last 30 years, ionophores and lipophilic chelators have been used for remote (gradient assisted) loading of radionuclides. The radionuclides can be entrapped in the aqueous core of the liposomes, using a method called “remote loading” or “after loading.” This method can provide high loading efficiency (>90%) and high in vivo stability and is superior to other labeling approaches. For example, Marik and coworkers,220 reported incorporation of [18F] fluorodipalmitin ([18F]FDP) into the liposome phospholipid bilayer. The incorporation of the no carrier added, radiolabeled lipid inside the phospholipid bilayer offers a generic approach to radiolabeling a wide variety of lipid-based drug delivery vehicles. In vivo imaging data showed that the long-circulating liposomes remained in the blood stream for at least 90 min and that the free [18F]FDP is not metabolized in the myocardium.\nThe remote loading strategy also was used for the loading of the PET radionuclide 64Cu into liposomes. Petersen et al.221 reported loading of 64Cu using a effective ionophore, 2-hydroxyquinoline, to carry 64Cu (II) across the membrane\nof preformed liposomes and deliver it to an encapsulated copper chelator. Using this ionophore, they achieved very efficient loading and retention stability (>99%), which makes the 64Cu-liposomes highly applicable as PET imaging agents. They showed the utility of the 64Cu-liposomes for quantitative in vivo imaging of healthy and tumor-bearing mice using PET. This remote loading method is a powerful tool for characterizing in vivo performance of liposome-based nanomedicine and has great potential in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In a similar work, Henriksen and co-workers222 suggested ionophore (2-hydroxyquinoline) assisted loading of 64Cu2+ into liposomes. 64Cu-liposomes showed high tumor accumulation in mice and long-term blood circulation in a canine cancer model. Locke and co-workers223 designed a mannosylated liposome (MANLIPs) and showed that it accumulates in tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in a mouse model of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Macrophages within the tumor microenvironment have been shown to play a major role in the growth and spread of many types of cancer. Cancer cells produce cytokines that cause macrophages to express scavenger receptors (e.g., the mannose receptor) and factors that facilitate tissue and blood vessel growth, suppress T cell mediated anti-tumor activity, and express enzymes that can break down the extracellular matrix, thereby promoting metastasis. In this study, liposomes were loaded with 64Cu to allow tracking by PET imaging and contained a fluorescent dye in the lipid bilayer permitting subsequent fluorescence microscopy. Remote loading was used to radiolabel DOTA-containing liposomes with 64Cu, by utilizing the lipophilic transporter hydroxyquinoline to ferry 64Cu to the liposome interior where it is more tightly chelated by the encapsulated DOTA. They injected these liposomes into a mouse model of lung cancer. In vivo PET images were acquired 6 h after injection followed by the imaging of select excised organs. MAN-LIPs accumulated in TAMs and exhibited little accumulation in remote lung areas. The obtained results showed that MAN-LIPs are a promising new vehicle for the delivery of imaging agents to lung TAMs. In addition to imaging, MAN-LIPs hold the potential for delivery of therapeutic agents to the tumor microenvironment. Petersen and co-workers,224 evaluated somatostatin receptor targeted 64Cu-TATE (octreotate, somatostatin peptide)-liposomes for PET imaging in a human neuroendocrine carcinoma mouse model. The presence of TATE on the liposomes resulted in a significantly faster initial blood clearance in comparison to control-liposomes without TATE. The obtained data showed that 64Cu-loaded PEGylated liposomes with TATE conjugated to the surface could be promising new imaging agents for visualizing tumor tissue and especially neuroendocrine tumors using PET.\nDiagnostic and therapeutic evaluation of 111In-vinorelbine(VBN)-liposomes in a human colorectal carcinoma HT29/luc-bearing animal model was reported by Chow et al.225 The significance of this strategy was that the combination of a low-dose radioisotope and an anticancer agent delivered by means of a nanoliposomal system could provide both diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy evaluation. The biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of 111In-DTPA-labeled\nJOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A | JAN 2019 VOL 107A, ISSUE 1 275\nREVIEW ARTICLE\npegylated liposomes in tumor-bearing nude mice were studied by Harrington et al.226 to examine possible applications of PEGylated liposome-targeted anti-cancer therapies. The obtained data provide important information on the tissues targeted by PEGylated liposomes and the extent and timecourse of uptake. In another study by Ogawa et al.,227 the atherosclerotic region was detectable by macrophage targeting with 111In-labeled liposomes. Liposome modification to obtain slower blood clearance and lower liver uptake was essential to improve the SPECT images.\n131I-labeled and DOX-loaded multifunctional nanoliposomes for radiotherapy and chemotherapy in brain gliomas reported by Gao and co-workers.228 131I-DOX-nanoliposomes was constructed based on BSA tailor-made hydrophobic maleimide-functionalized poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and evaluated by cellular viability in vitro and by U87 xenograft models in vivo. In the U87 mouse tumor models, the combination therapy resulted in higher survival rates of mice and smaller tumor sizes than monotherapy did alone. The results showed that multifunctional nanoliposome 131I-DOX is a good candidate for the codelivery of 131I-mediated radiotherapy and DOX-mediated chemotherapy due to its ability to inhibit U87 cell proliferation and tumor growth. 131I-DOXnanoliposome can be used as a promising effective therapy for malignant gliomas and deserves further investigation.\nAn effective method for radiolabeling liposomes with 99mTc“SNS/S” complexes was developed by Bao et al.229 Liposomes encapsulating glutathione (GSH) were studied for 99mTc labeling. N,N-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)-N0,N0-diethyl-ethylenediamine (BMEDA), N,N-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)-1-butylamine (BMBuA), and benzene thiol (BT) were investigated to make 99mTc“BMEDA,” 99mTc-“BMEDAþBT,” 99mTc-“BMBuA,” and 99mTc“BMBuAþBT” for liposome labeling. The labeling efficiencies of 99mTc-GSH liposomes were from 36.9 to 69.2%. After incubation in serum, 99mTc-GSH liposomes labeled with 99mTc“BMEDA” or 99mTc-“BMEDAþBT” had the best labeling stability of the formulations tested. Distribution studies after intravenous injection of 99mTc-liposomes composed of distearoyl phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and cholesterol had a slow blood clearance and a high spleen accumulation demonstrating the in vivo labeling stability of the radiolabeled liposomes. This labeling method can be applied to liposome radiolabeling with not only 99mTc but also two therapeutic radionuclides 188Re and 186Re.\nThe therapeutic effects of β-emission 186Re and 188Re were investigated by nanoliposomes. Several studies indicated that 186Re-labeled nanoliposomes have potential applications in radiotherapy. For example, 188Re-BMEDA-labeled PEGylated nanoliposomes were reported by Chen et al.230 Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and imaging of 188ReBMEDA-labeled PEGylated liposomes after intraperitoneal injection in a C26 colon carcinoma ascites mouse model. The results showed the long circulation, bioavailability, and localization of radioactive nanocomposite in tumor and ascites sites. In a similar research by Chen and co-workers,231 the pharmacokinetics and internal radionuclide therapy of intraperitoneally administrated 188Re-BMEDA-labeled PEGylated liposomal DOX (188Re-DOX-liposome) were investigated in the C26 murine colon carcinoma ascites mouse model. After\nintraperitoneal administration of the nanotargeted bimodality 188Re-DXR-liposome, the ascites and tumor accumulation of the radioactivity were observed. The intraperitoneal administration of 188Re-DXR-liposome could provide a benefit and promising strategy for delivery of passive nanotargeted bimodality radiochemotherapeutics in oncology applications. The 188Re-labeled PEGylated nanoliposome was also evaluated for its potential as a theragnostic agent in orthotopic glioma bearing rat model by Huang et al.232 This strategy revealed the potential of 188Re-liposome as a theragnostic agent for brain glioma. In addition, the therapeutic effects of 186Re carried by liposomes into the tumor remnants in a nude rat squamous cell carcinoma xenograft model were studied by Wang et al.233 There are synergy between 186Re and liposomal DOX for chemoradionuclide therapy because that the addition of 186Re to liposomal DOX decreases both tumor volume and viable tumor volume. In an interesting study by Soundararajan and co-workers,234 the chemoradionuclide therapy with 186Re-labeled liposomal DOX in combination with radiofrequency ablation for effective treatment of head and neck cancer in a nude rat tumor xenograft model was reported.\nLiposomes can be potentially used to carry 225Ac as a powerful α-particle generator. Chang et al.235 suggested that antibody conjugated liposomes (immunoliposomes) bearing high-specific activities of 225Ac with adequate binding efficacy and specificity to cancer cells can be developed and may potentially be used for targeted α-particle therapy of micrometastatic cancer. In vivo evaluation of the stability and targeting specificity of these liposomes was investigated. 225Ac-loaded immunoliposomes overcome the limitations of low-specific activity for molecular carriers and are expected to be therapeutically useful against tumor cells having a low antigen density.\nNanocages. The ferritins, a family of protein cages, play a key role in iron sequestration. Each ferritin is made of 24 subunits, which self-assemble to form a cage-like nanostructure, with external and internal diameters of 12 and 8 nm, respectively.236 These protein cage architectures are versatile nanoscale platforms amenable to sequestering a wide range of divalent radiometals with high affinity.237 For example, trapping 64Cu into ferritin nanocages was achieved by simply adding 64Cu2+ into a mixture of heavy and light ferritin chains in acidic conditions, and then the adjusting pH back to 7.4 to reform [64Cu]ferritin nanocages for PET imaging.236\nNoble-metal nanocages comprise a novel class of 3D nanostructures possessing hollow interiors and porous walls. Because the Au nanocages have large absorption cross-sections, they are also effective photothermal transducers; thus, they might provide a therapeutic effect through selective hyperthermia-induced killing of targeted cancer cells.238 With Au nanocages as an example, Black et al.239 recently demonstrated that radioactive 198Au could be incorporated into the crystal lattice of Au nanostructures for simple and reliable quantification of their in vivo biodistribution by measuring the γ radiation from 198Au decay and for"

They extended the capability of this strategy to synthesize radioactive 198Au nanostructures with a similar size but different shapes and then compared their biodistribution, tumor uptake, and intratumoral distribution using a murine EMT6 breast cancer model. Specifically, they investigated Au nanospheres, nanodisks, nanorods, and cubic nanocages. After PEGylation, an aqueous suspension of the radioactive Au nanostructures was injected into a tumor-bearing mouse intravenously, and their biodistribution was measured from the γ radiation while their tumor uptake was directly imaged using the Cerenkov radiation. Significantly, higher tumor uptake was observed for the Au nanospheres and nanodisks relative to the Au nanorods and nanocages at 24 h postinjection. Furthermore, autoradiographic imaging was performed on thin slices of the tumor after excision to resolve the intratumoral distributions of the nanostructures. Interestingly, nanorods and nanocages could reach the cores of the tumors, whereas nanospheres and nanodisks were only observed on the surfaces of the tumors, suggesting the unique positions of Au nanorods and nanocages for photothermal cancer treatment.\nFuture studies need to focus on further improving the blood circulation half-life and pharmacokinetics of these Au nanocages to reduce uptake by liver and spleen and minimize radiation burden, test these nanostructures in other tumor models, and add molecular targeting ligands to their surfaces to increase their tumor uptake for the better use of the therapeutic capability provided by the β-emission and photothermal conversion."

      "text" : "Renal clearance of nanomaterials is a multifaceted process involving glomerular filtration, tubular secretion and finally elimination of the nanomaterials through urinary excretion. Filtration of particles through the glomerular capillary wall (glomerular filtration) is highly dependent on the in vivo hydrodynamic diameter (HD) and is referred to as the filtration-size threshold. Nanomaterials with an HD <6 nm are typically filtered, while those >8 nm are not typically capable of glomerular filtration.240 Filtration of nanomaterials within the intermediate range (6–8 nm in HD) depends upon both size and charge of the particle. The hepatobiliary system represents the primary route of excretion for particles that do not undergo renal clearance. One of the physiologic functions of the liver is to efficiently capture and eliminate particles on the scale of 10–20 nm.241 The agents within this size range often undergo rapid liver uptake.\nIn this section, we briefly discuss current research regarding the clearance of the various types of widely used nanomaterials in nuclear medicine. For example, the relationship between HD, renal clearance, and total body retention for QDs of difference sizes was studied by Choi et al.241 Data demonstrated that renal clearance was the primary excretion route for dots with HD ranging from 4.36 to 5.52 nm with renal clearance decreasing with increasing size. Larger QDs did not demonstrate renal clearance and\ninstead accumulated in the liver, lung, and spleen. The clearance studies involving pristine SWCNs have shown significant RES tropism and liver accumulation of these particles (attributed to the lipophilicity of the carbon atoms), while chemically functionalized SWNTs have demonstrated renal clearance with insignificant RES uptake.242 Further clearance studies are needed to assess the influence of chemical functionalization on SWNTs tissue tropism and clearance. A study conducted by De Jong et al.243 examined the influence of AuNPs size on tissue distribution in rats and revealed that size was a key determinant of in vivo particle distribution. Comparison of organ particle deposition between large and small particles revealed that particle deposition for the 10 nm particle was greatest in the liver, followed by blood, spleen, kidney, lungs, brain, reproductive organs, thymus and heart; whereas the 50, 100, and 250 nm particles were only significantly deposited in the liver, spleen and blood. The magnetic NPs demonstrate specific-uptake by the monocyte–macrophage system. They are primarily cleared from the blood by the RES.240"

      "text" : "NANOTECHNOLOGY IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE\nIn recent decades, the development of nanotechnology has provided an opportunity to overcome the side effects of radiopharmaceuticals. The combination of various nanomaterials with medical radionuclides has allowed the development of advanced methods for targeted radionuclide therapy and imaging, which may revolutionize the treatment of tumors. The various particulated radionuclides and nanocarriers have presented great potential for cancer radiotherapy by enhancing the effectiveness of treatments and reducing systemic side effects. Despite all these advances, there are many challenges in this area.\nOne of these challenges is the direct radiolabeling of nanomaterials without further interaction with chelators. Traditional approaches for radiolabeling NPs rely on wellestablished radiochemical methods using radiometal ion chelation and functionalization to NP surface or functionalization to NP coating. In the functionalization of NP surface, NPs are typically conjugated with surface reactive groups that serve a dual-purpose. First, they allow covalent attachment of radionuclides via multidentate chelates. Second, they provide thermodynamically, kinetically and metabolically stable anchors ensuring that the radionuclide remains associated with the NP in vivo. Three common examples of the NP surface functionalization include thiol-mediated binding to AuNPs,121 silylation of surface hydroxyls142 and bisphosphonate binding to Fe3O4 NPs.\n145 The other fundamental approach to radiolabeled NPs involves attachment to the NP coating. Radiolabeling reactions on NP coatings involve chelate-based chemistries similar to those described above. The key difference is that surface-anchoring groups are not required for radiolabeling of coatings. Instead, a radioactive group is introduced to the coating via covalent bond formation. A disadvantage of traditional radiolabeling methods is that the introduction of metal ion chelate can have adverse\nJOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A | JAN 2019 VOL 107A, ISSUE 1 277\nREVIEW ARTICLE\neffects on the pharmacokinetic, stability, and toxicity profiles of the NP.244,245 For this reason, efforts are being made to identify alternative methods for radiolabeling NPs that avoid the use of chelates that alter surface properties. Ion exchange,94 direct chemisorption,138 radiochemical doping,178 physicosorption by electrostatic attractions concerning to the NP zeta potential/surface charge215 and cavity encapsulation for trapping radioactive species inside the cavity of a NP236 are effective strategies for generating a wide range of radiolabeled nanomaterials. These methods are suitable alternatives for the classic strategies and are in progress for future applications in nuclear nanomedicine.\nTraditional nuclear medicine strategies that deliver therapeutic radioisotopes to tumors rely on β-particle-emitters such as 131I, 67Cu, 177Lu and 90Y. Given the promise of α-particle-therapeutics in early preclinical and clinical investigations, there has been a recent interest in using these redionuclides for α-particle-based radiotherapy of tumors. The short path length renders α-emitters suitable for treatment of minimal disease such as micro metastases or residual tumor after surgical resection of a primary lesion, hematologic cancers, infections and compartmental cancers. In the context of targeted radiotherapy or radioimmunotherapy (antibody-guided radiation therapy), α-particle emitters have the advantages of high potency and specificity. These advantages arise from the densely ionizing track and short path length of the emitted positively charged helium nucleus in tissue. The first clinical trial of an α-particle emitter in targeted radiotherapy employed 213Bi conjugated to the anti-leukemia Ab, HuM195, and was reported in 1997,246 4 years after 213Bi was first suggested for therapeutic use. Targeted radiotherapy with α-emitting radionuclides is an attractive approach for the treatment of minimal residual disease because the short path lengths and high energies of α-particles produce optimal cytotoxicity at small target sites while minimizing damage to surrounding normal tissues. As compared with conventional targeted radiotherapy, the use of nanocarriers can allow for specific multivalent attachment of targeted molecules of antibodies, peptides or ligands to the surface of nanocarriers. Considering the high potential of α-emitters for future development of targeted radiotherapy, these radionuclides can be the suitable candidates for radiolabeling of nanomaterials, especially in combination with biological receptors such as antibodies, peptides or aptamers.\nTraditional radionuclide imaging techniques hardly meet the demands of individualized cancer diagnosis because of the growing trend toward the advancement of accurate diagnosis of diseases, especially cancer. Much detailed information is highly needed for the accurate diagnosis of diseases. However, one single-imaging modality cannot provide complete information. The conundrum of modality selection in clinical diagnostic imaging is that modalities with the highest sensitivity have relatively poor resolution, while those with high resolution have relatively poor sensitivity. PET, SPECT, and optical techniques, which produce images with detailed information, have high sensitivity but with poor resolution.\nIn contrast, X-ray, MRI, and CT can produce high-resolution images of anatomy, but their sensitivity is relatively poor.247 Thus, the combination of imaging technologies has long been proposed. The first fused PET/CT instrument was developed in 1998 by Townsend et al. in collaboration with Siemens Medical. This instrument was considered as one of the “Inventions of the Year” in 2000 by Time magazine and this instrument became available commercially in 2001.248 Consequently, numerous multimodality imaging technologies have been designed and developed to boost the clinical benefits of hybrid imaging technology. The development of multimodal imaging agents is a key factor in this field. One of the most active areas of multimodality probe research has been in radiolabeled nanomaterials, which have proven to lend themselves well to the “blending” required to generate multimodal functionality.248 Although the NPs remain inherently challenging systems, they present unparalleled opportunities for developing multimodality radiotracers. The size and multicomponent nature of many nanomaterials such as fluorescent QDs, magnetic NPs and plasmonic NPs offer a forgiving platform to combine probe materials for various imaging modalities. Compared with complex multistep organic synthesis methods required for typical multimodal small molecule probes, some NP syntheses are rapid and relatively facile. In addition, the expansion of chelate-free radiochemistry has broadened the tools available to radiochemists, narrowing the gap between academic curiosity and clinical translation. Future advancements will likely utilize intrinsically radiolabeled nanomedicines as multimodality imaging agents that target specific disease biomarkers.\nFinally, however, the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of drugs and radionuclides delivered by the nanocarriers have been much improved; there are three major challenges of applying NPs to delivery of drugs or radionuclides: (1) synthesizing nanocarriers with stealth characteristics, which are able to decrease uptake of delivered diagnostic and therapeutic agents in the RES and prolong blood circulation, (2 producing multifunctional NPs with improved in vivo targeting capabilities, and interaction with disease biomarkers at the molecular level, and (3) developing reliable approaches to test these new materials in vitro and in vivo for a fast translation from the bench to the bedside.249"

In recent years, increasing efforts have been focused on developing nanoconstructs that can be used as core platforms for attaching medical radionuclides with different strategies for the purposes of molecular imaging and targeted drug delivery. This review article presents an introduction to some commonly used nanomaterials with zero-dimensional, one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional structures, describes the various methods applied to radiolabeling of nanomaterials, and provides illustrative examples of application of the nanoscale radionuclides or radiolabeled nanocarriers in nuclear nanomedicine. Especially, the passive and active nanotargeting delivery of radionuclides with illustrating examples for tumor imaging and therapy was reviewed and summarized. The accurate and early diagnosis of cancer can lead to increased survival rates for different types of this disease. Although, the conventional single-modality diagnostic methods such as positron emission tomography/single photon emission computed tomography or MRI used for such purposes are powerful means; most of these are limited by sensitivity or resolution. By integrating complementary signal reporters into a single nanoparticulate contrast agent, multimodal molecular imaging can be performed as scalable images with high sensitivity, resolution, and specificity. The advent of radiolabeled nanocarriers or radioisotope-loaded nanomaterials with magnetic, plasmonic, or fluorescent properties has stimulated growing interest in the developing multimodality imaging probes. These new developments in nuclear nanomedicine are expected to introduce a paradigm shift in multimodal molecular imaging and thereby opening up an era of new diagnostic medical imaging agents. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
