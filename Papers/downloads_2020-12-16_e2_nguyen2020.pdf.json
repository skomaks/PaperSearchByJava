The thermal conductivity of TiC ceramic was improved significantly due to the incorporation of nano-diamond additive. Although the introduction of diamond worsened the sintering behavior of the sintered TiC ceramic, it enhanced the formation of continuous network of the graphitized diamond at the grain boundaries. However, the addition of TiN to the TiCdiamond sample led to the formation of nitrogen gas at high temperatures, resulting in a semi-porous ceramic containing ~13% porosity. Furthermore, the unreacted TiN was dissolved in the matrix, creating a solid solution of Ti(C,N). Despite the beneficial influence of nano-diamond on the thermal conductivity of TiC, the incorporation of TiN and nano-diamond in TiC ceramics decreased the flexural strength and hardness."

      "text" : "Incorporating transition metals in the fourth and fifth groups of the periodic table with boron and carbon leads to a group of materials called ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) with high melting points (above 3000 °C) [1–8]. As one of the most promising UHTCs, TiC has attracted considerable attention owing to its exceptional combination of qualities, i.e., low density (4.93 g/cm3), great hardness (~30 GPa), high melting point (~3260 °C), high electrical conductivity (30 × 106 Ω cm), high thermal conductivity, high thermal and chemical stability, low neutron absorption cross-section, low friction coefficient to metals, and so forth [9–13]. These properties have made TiC a great option for high-temperature applications, especially at the aerospace industry [14,15]. Besides, TiC substances are widely being used in machining materials, cutting tools, nuclear industry, inert\nmatrix fuels (IMF), ‘‘Hall-Heroult’’ electrolytic cells, and so on [9,16]. Nevertheless, similar to other ceramics, poor sinterability, and low resistivity against the thermal shock are among the inherent demerits of TiC materials, which should be dealt with [17]. In addition, other limitations of TiC, like low self-diffusion coefficient, along with poor sinterability, have made this ceramic challenging to produce. Although increasing the sintering temperature overcomes the problem of the sinterability of the monolithic TiC, such a measure may result in grain coarsening and deteriorating of mechanical properties. Consequently, other approaches should be taken to overcome the limitations above [18,19]. The utilization of advanced sintering methods, e.g., hotpressing (HP) [20–24] and spark plasma sintering (SPS) [25–33], was introduced by some researchers as a remedy. In the latter route, rapid densification takes place at roughly low sintering temperatures, and as a result, grains do not have enough time to grow [34–45]. Briefly, SPS is\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.152 Received 10 July 2020; Received in revised form 11 August 2020; Accepted 16 August 2020\n∗ Corresponding author.

On the other hand, some scientists suggested introducing various metallic binder, e.g., Co [48], Ni [49], Mo [50], and Fe [51] to diminish the sintering temperature of TiC. However, the lower melting point of such binders may adversely affect the TiC performance at high temperatures [10]. Accordingly, quite a few researchers have focused on uplifting the qualifications of TiC by introducing suitable ceramic additives, e.g., TiB2 [52], WC [53,54], SiC [55], ZrN [56,57], TiN [58], BN [59,60], AlN [61–63], carbon black [64], graphene [65,66], graphite [67,68], and diamond [69,70]. As it is clear, nitrides and carbonaceous phases were among the additives in the spotlight.\nThe effects of hexagonal BN (h-BN) additive on the sintering behavior and mechanical properties of TiC were assessed by Shaddel et al. [59]. It was reported that although the influence of h-BN on the sinterability of TiC was trivial, its presence in the microstructure reduced both hardness and flexural strength of as-sintered samples. Pazhouhanfar et al. [58] studied the introduction of a low amount of TiN additive in the TiC system. The influence of TiN on the mechanical properties was similar to h-BN; however, the relative density of TiC–TiN composite experienced a slight increment by ~1.5%. Fattahi et al. [61] reached a fully dense TiC-based composite with introducing 5 wt% AlN as an additive. Such a ceramic was fabricated using the SPS method at 1900 °C. The effect of the addition of AlN on the hardness of TiC was negligible, but it enhanced the flexural strength of the composite by 36% in comparison with the monolithic sample. Sribalaji et al. [71] introduced a low amount of carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) to the TiC-WC system SPSed at 1600 °C. Activating a novel toughening mechanism, called graphene nanoribbon grain wrapping, led to significant growth in the fracture toughness (~120%) of the composite compared to TiC. Though the addition of graphite [67] enhanced the relative density of TiC, graphene [65] was inefficient on this quality. Moreover, adding nano-graphite strengthened the TiC matrix, obtaining a flexural strength of ~630 MPa.\nDespite the brilliant researches that have been implemented on the TiC-based composites so far, the authors, in this paper, have tried to produce and study a novel TiC-based material through the introduction of TiN and nano-diamonds additives at the same time. The sintering behavior, thermodynamic, and mechanical qualifications of such a composite were compared to those of the monolithic TiC, TiC–TiN, and TiC- diamond specimens. The spark plasma sintering (SPS) process was used for fabricating all ceramics mentioned above. The applied sintering circumstances were 1900 °C, 10 min, and 40 MPa in this work."

Some data related to these materials, i.e., providers, purity, and particle size, are presented in Table 1. First, the requisite amounts of each powder were closely weighted for fabricating four different samples based on Table 2. Later, each composition, except the pure TiC, was individually dispersed for half an hour in the ethanol medium using an ultrasonic appliance. After that, the prepared slurries were heated up for 2 h at 120 °C on a hot plate armed with a magnetic shaker to remove the previously added\nmedium, as well as applying an extra mixing. The dehumidification of the slurries was carried out at the temperature of 100 °C for one day using an oven device. The dried slurries were smashed by a mortar out of agate and screened through a 100-mesh sieve. The prepared homogeneous mixtures, as well as the pure TiC, were subsequently loaded into a graphite mold to be sintered at 1900 °C by a SPS facility (Nanozint 10i, KPF Co., Iran), separately. All ceramics were maintained at the final temperature for 10 min, where an external pressure of 40 MPa was applied to them. Moreover, a graphite foil as a liner was used to eliminate any chemical reaction between the die and the samples. Fig. 1 exhibits the illustrated schematic steps for manufacturing the TTD (TiC–TiN-Diamond) sample in this work."

The identification of the existing phases in the initial powders, as well as in the SPSed specimens, was accomplished using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD: PW3710 X, Philips). A field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM: S8000, Tescan) was implemented to assess the microstructure of the samples on both polished and fracture surfaces. The electron microscopy machine was also powered by energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDS: DXP-X10P), which was used for doing the elemental evaluation. Two software packages, i.e., HSC (Ver. 6, Outotec) and ImageJ (Ver. 1.52a, Wayne Rasband), were utilized for thermodynamic studies and quantitative metallography appraisal, respectively. The average value for six indentations was reported as the Vickers hardness of each specimen measured by applying load (100 g) on the polished surface of the SPSed ceramics. The three-point bending method was applied on the standard specimens (3 × 4 × 28 mm3 with a span length of 15 mm) to measure the flexural strength of the samples using a universal testing apparatus (STM-250). Finally, thermal conductivity at the ambient temperature of the samples was metered by a conductivity meter (Sahand Co., Iran)."

      "text" : "The electron microscopy images and the attributing XRD patterns of initial TiC, TiN, and nano-diamonds powders used in this research are presented in Fig. 2. According to the FESEM images, it is observable that the particle size and the morphology of as-purchased materials are in agreement with the data acclaimed by the suppliers. Moreover, not detecting any unwanted compound in the relevant XRD results manifested the high purity of these powders.\nThe estimated relative density values of the SPSed ceramics as ratios of bulk and theoretical densities are exhibited graphically in Fig. 3. Based on this bar char, the monolithic TiC reached a relative density of over 95% by spark plasma sintering at 1900 °C. Although introducing TiN additive improved this value trivially, standing at 97.1%, the addition of 5 wt% nano-diamonds had a detrimental influence on the sintering behavior of TiC, resulting in a specimen with around 10% remaining porosity. The co-addition of both of these additives simultaneously within the TiC matrix was even worse than the influence of the nano-diamonds alone, which led to a porous composite with around 13% remaining porosity. It seems that the co-existence of these additives, in the TiC system, induced some reactions with gaseous products, through which the relative density of the TTD sample was dropped. The XRD evaluation, together with the thermodynamic study, can be worthwhile to explain the mechanisms that led to such results [72,73].\nFig. 4 indicates the XRD analyses of the monolithic sample and composite ceramics. According to the result associated with the T specimen, it is apparent that non-stoichiometric TiCx was generated over the SPS process. The creation of such a phase was due to the carbon atoms left the TiC crystalline structure, leading to depositing graphitized carbon at the matrix grain boundaries. This explanation is utterly in agreement with the carbon peak that appeared at 2θ ~91° in the relevant pattern. More information about this phenomenon can be found in our previous papers [54,65,67]. However, it should be noted that the precipitation of carbon from TiC during the SPS process has two main impacts on the sintering behavior of TiC. First, the carbon flakes between the matrix grains hinder the grain coarsening to some extent, which is beneficial in enhancing the relative density. Second, the free graphitized carbon has this opportunity to interact chemically with the TiC oxide layer (based on Eq. (1)), i.e., TiO2, depleting the TiC particles of the surface oxide. The ΔG° of this reaction at 1900 °C is\n-199.7 kJ, which indicates its favorability in the present sintering conditions. The presence of TiO2 not only impedes a strong bonding among the TiC particles, but it may lead to excessive grain growth. Accordingly, the progression of Eq. (1) would be advantageous in improving the sinterability of pure TiC.\n+ = +TiO2    3C   TiC   2CO (g) (1)\nBased on the XRD result of the TT specimen, the addition of TiN to the matrix resulted in the emergence of no new peak in the attributing pattern compared to that of the monolithic TiC. However, four peaks overlapped with the peaks associated with the TiC/TiCx compounds were identified in this composite. Therefore, it seems that the SPS process had not been reactive in the TiC–TiN system. However, wherever TiN and free carbon co-exist, the advancement of a reaction between them is probable based on Eq. (2). The products of this equation are in-situ TiC and a gaseous phase (N2). The Gibbs free energy of such a reaction (ΔG°) at 1900 °C is -44.5 kJ, manifesting its feasibility at the present sintering circumstances. Although the formation of the N2 gas may lead to an increase in the volume percentage of the remaining porosity of the TT sample, it seems that the role of TiN additive in grain refining overweighed its detrimental influence. It is also worth mentioning that the remaining TiN can dissolve within the matrix, forming\nTi(C,N) solid solution [58].\n+ = +2TiN   2C   2TiC   N2(g) (2)\nThe introduction of 5 wt% nano-diamonds, as shown in Fig. 3, resulted in the appearance of an exclusive peak related to the graphite phase at 2θ ~26.5°. The graphitization of nano-diamonds depends on the various factors, such as environment (vacuum, inert gas, etc.), pressure, temperature, diamond-type, diamond size, and so forth. Depending on the surface circumstances of the nano-diamonds particles, the graphitization at atmospheric pressure may be initiated between ~670 and 900 °C. Nevertheless, happening such a phenomenon even at lower temperatures is possible in the SPS process, thanks to the applied sub-atmospheric pressures. Although the SPS process is implemented under a high vacuum, even the presence of a trace amount of O2 gas may result in accelerating the graphitization kinetics [74–76]. According to the discussion above, it sounds that the entire introduced nano-diamonds was graphitized during the sintering process, which is in harmony with the corresponding XRD pattern. The reason for the lower relative density of this ceramic in comparison with the monolithic TiC can be related to two different factors. First, the diamond graphitization requires a large amount of energy [77], which can consume the required energy available for the consolidation stage. Second,\nthe graphitized diamond produced at high temperatures has this chance to react with the remaining TiO2, producing more CO gas based on Eq. (1). Though this gas can leave the system easily at low temperatures (like ~ 1300 °C where Eq. (1) initiates progressing), its chance for doing so would be minimal if the reaction takes place at higher temperatures, where plastic deformation is the dominant densification mechanism. Consequently, the produced gas is entrapped in the microstructure, contributing to decreasing the relative density.\nThe XRD pattern of the TTD sample, as can be seen in Fig. 3, is the cumulative version of those of the TT and TD ceramics. However, its much lower relative density compared to the other samples seems a bit strange. The answer to this different behavior may be sought through Eq. (2). By graphitizing of nano-diamonds particles, more carbon would be available to react with TiN. As this reaction is favorable at temperatures over ~1700 °C, the entrapment of the generated gas (N2) is probable in this sample. Consequently, it seems that this factor, together with the causes explained for the TD specimen, is responsible for such a relative density in this composite."

      "heading" : "3.2. Microstructural study",
      "text" : "The electron microscopy images from the polished surface of the\nmonolithic TiC are presented in Fig. 5a. As indicated in this micrograph, the microstructure includes some remaining pores and precipitated carbon, which dispersed uniformly within a matrix of TiC/TiCx. It should also be taken into account that some of the pore-like cavities in this micrograph do not represent actual porosity, but they are artificial pores created over the polishing step. According to the micrograph associated with the TT specimen in Fig. 5b, no apparent secondary phase was observable in this sample. This microstructure is in agreement with our previous discussion based on the dissolution of TiN into the TiC matrix, forming Ti(C,N) solid solution. Moreover, the precipitated carbon had this chance to react with TiN, according to Eq. (2), leading to the in-situ generation of TiC. Therefore, less visible graphitized diamond in this ceramic compared to the monolithic sample verifies the advancement of Eq. (2) over the sintering process. On the other hand, the introduction of nano-diamonds to TiC resulted in the emergence of the graphitized carbon in the micrograph of the TD sample (Fig. 5c). This secondary phase dispersed homogeneously within the matrix, indicating an appropriate mixing method [78–80]. According to the explanations above, it is predictable that the microstructure of the TTD composite comprises of some graphitized diamond distributed within a solid solution matrix, namely Ti(C, N). To have a better perspective, the EDS map analyses from the polished surface of\nthe TTD sample are exhibited in Fig. 6. According to Fig. 6c, the areas with graphitized diamond can be identified. Besides, the dispersion of N (Fig. 6d) all over the micrograph, expect where carbon is accumulated, confirms the dissolution of the introduced TiN within the TiC matrix during the sintering process. However, the zones with a high concentration of N can be related to the undissolved TiN. Fig. 7 exhibits two high-resolution FESEM images from the polished surfaces of the sample co-introduced by TiN and nano-diamonds. The porous structure at the grain boundaries confirms the production of gas over the process (based on Eq. (2)), where graphitized diamond and TiN co-existed. In addition, the EDS line analysis presented in Fig. 7c may be useful in tracking the available phases within the micrograph shown in Fig. 7b.\nThe fractographs of the SPSed ceramics are shown in Fig. 8. Excessive grain growth can be observed in the image related to the monolithic TiC (Fig. 8a). As noted above, although the deposition of carbon may somehow prohibit the grain coarsening, the amount of such phase was not sufficient to predominantly affect grain growth [81–85]. The majority of the remained porosity in this sample is linked to the unclosed triple pockets. In other words, though the formation of neck and densification proceeded considerably, reaching a fully dense specimen required a suitable sintering aid [86–90]. Moreover, some intragranular pores can be observed in this fractograph, verifying the grain boundary migration as one of the grain growth mechanisms [91–94]. Considering the TT composite, the addition of TiN, as shown clearly in Fig. 8b, improved the sinterability of TiC slightly; nevertheless, the remaining porosity is considerable. Though the introduction of nano-diamonds seems to fill the available pores, the microstructure,\nwhere the graphitized diamond is present, seems to be full of microporosity (Fig. 8c). This phenomenon seems to be even worse in the TTD specimen (Fig. 8d), in which the co-existence of TiN and nano-diamonds resulted in gas production at high temperatures. It is also worth mentioning that both intergranular and transgranular fracture modes were activated in all samples, which can be beneficial in strengthening these ceramics [95–98].\nBased on the fractographs shown in Fig. 8, the average grain size of each sample was also measured using the ImageJ software, and the results are reported in a bar chart in Fig. 9a. As it is apparent, the impacts of introducing TiN and nano-diamonds in grain refining of the TT and TD composites were roughly similar (~30% smaller grain size compared to the monolithic TiC). However, when both of these additives were simultaneously introduced to the matrix, the grain size of the TiC was approximately halved."

      "text" : "The Vickers hardness values of the as-produced samples are presented in Fig. 9b. According to this graph, the monolithic TiC had the highest value of hardness (~3130 HV0.1 kg) among the specimens. Nevertheless, introducing additive(s) to TiC decreased this value marginally. Among the factors influencing the hardness of a composite sample, i.e., microstructure, composition, relative density, and grain size [59], it seems composition was the dominant item in reducing the hardness of TT composite in comparison with the pure TiC. As noted previously, though the grain size and the relative density of TT were\nsmaller and larger than T, respectively, the former offered a lower Vickers hardness. It was reported that the hardness of Ti(C,N) solid solution is 20%–40% lower than those for the pure TiC and TiN [99,100]; consequently, it seems that the formation of such a phase was accountable for this reduction in this quality. By contrast, the Vickers hardness value of TD ceramic is between those of the T and TT samples. Although TD had a smaller grain size than TiC, it seems that its lower relative density and the availability of a soft phase (graphite) in its microstructure were the dominant factors in such a decrease. Finally, the accumulative destructive impacts of both these additives led to the lowest value of hardness for the TTD composite, standing at 2542 HV0.1 kg.\nThe flexural strength of the samples is also exhibited in Fig. 9c. According to this bar chart, the addition of a secondary phase(s) resulted in a drop in the strength of TiC. The highest value of flexural strength (over 500 MPa) was secured for the monolithic sample, while the poorest strength was obtained for the TTD composite (305 MPa). The flexural strength of TiC decreased by ~11% with the addition of 5 wt% TiN, although the TT sample had a higher relative density and a smaller grain size than the monolithic TiC. Accordingly, it seems that the brittle nature of the Ti(C, N) phase was in charge of such a drop in the strength of TiC. On the other hand, considering the results of the\nflexural strength of the TD and TTD composites, the remaining porosity was possibly responsible for even more drop in the flexural strength of TiC compared to the TT ceramic."

      "heading" : "3.4. Thermal conductivity",
      "text" : "The thermal conductivities of the SPSed ceramics are shown in Fig. 9d. Introducing TiN led to a decrease of around 33% in the thermal conductivity of TiC, standing at 13.5 W/mK. It is worth noting that thermal conductivity greatly depends on the microstructure. In ceramic materials, heat is mainly transferred through phonons, whereas electrons are responsible for metals [17,101–103]. Consequently, the thermal conductivity of ceramic-based composites relies upon the mean free path of phonons, which is controlled by secondary phases, grain size, grain boundaries, point defects, etc. [104–107]. Hence, it sounds that the fine-grain, together with the formation of the Ti(C,N) solid solution, was the main factor in determining the thermal conductivity of the TT specimen. By contrast, introducing 5 wt% nano-diamonds boosted the thermal conductivity of TiC by ~31%, standing at 23.3 W/ mK. Reasonably, the lower relative density and smaller grain size of this sample than the pure TiC should result in lower thermal conductivity [108]. Nevertheless, the probable creation of a continuous network of\nthe graphitized diamond, which has a much higher thermal conductivity than TiC [109], led to such an increment in this quality. Finally, the TTD ceramic reached a thermal conductivity of 15.4 W/mK, which was even lower than that of the monolithic sample. Considering all previous explanations, it seems that the remaining porosity was the prevailing factor on this decrease [110,111]."

The SPS method at 1900° was employed to fabricate the TiC-based samples. The outcomes determined the generation of non-stoichiometric TiCx in all ceramics. This phenomenon was accompanied by the precipitation of carbon at the TiC grain boundaries, which was beneficial in the eradication of TiO2 oxide layers available on the TiC particles. The addition of TiN led to the formation of a solid solution of Ti(C, N), while the introduced diamond seems to be graphitized during the SPS process. However, the co-existence of both these additives led to chemical interaction, resulting in producing TiC and N2 gas. Such a produced gas deteriorated the relative density of the TTD composite. Although introducing TiN or, and nano-diamond decreased the flexural strength and hardness of TiC, the addition of nano-diamond significantly improved thermal conductivity.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."

The thermal conductivity of TiC ceramic was improved significantly due to the incorporation of nano-diamond additive. Although the introduction of diamond worsened the sintering behavior of the sintered TiC ceramic, it enhanced the formation of continuous network of the graphitized diamond at the grain boundaries. However, the addition of TiN to the TiCdiamond sample led to the formation of nitrogen gas at high temperatures, resulting in a semi-porous ceramic containing ~13% porosity. Furthermore, the unreacted TiN was dissolved in the matrix, creating a solid solution of Ti(C,N). Despite the beneficial influence of nano-diamond on the thermal conductivity of TiC, the incorporation of TiN and nano-diamond in TiC ceramics decreased the flexural strength and hardness.",
