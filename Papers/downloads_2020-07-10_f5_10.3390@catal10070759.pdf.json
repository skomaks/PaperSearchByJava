      "text" : "Fossil fuel is a non-renewable resource with limited reserves [1–3]. Over the past 140 years, we have consumed one trillion barrels of oil, and today, the world’s demand for energy has exceeded 1000 barrels of oil, 100,000 cubic meters of natural gas, and 221 tons of coal per second [4]. It is clear that the consumption of fossil fuels is not sustainable in the long-term and has caused serious harm to the environment and human health [5]. It is reported in [6] that the energy challenges we face are related to the “tragedy of the commons”: we treat fossil fuels as resources that can be extracted and used in any way by anyone, anywhere, and use the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans as landfills, emitting more than 30 Gt of CO2 per year [7]. Dyes play an important role in various sectors of the dyeing and textile industries, most of which are synthetic dyes. These dyes usually come from coal tar and petroleum intermediates, with the annual output of more than 7 × 105 tons [8–10]. Konstantinou and Albanis [11] mentioned that industrial and textile dyes are mostly toxic organic compounds. It is estimated that nearly 17 to 20 percent of water pollution is related to the textile finishing and dyeing industries [12]. In 1974, the Ecological and Toxicological Association of the Dyestuffs Manufacturing Industry (ETAD) was established to protect consumers by working fully with the government to minimize environmental damage by addressing issues related to the toxicological impact of the products [13]. In the ETAD survey, among the 4000 test samples, the LD50 value of 90% of dyes was more than 2 × 10−3 mg kg−1. Of all the tested dyes, diazo,\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 759; doi:10.3390/catal10070759 www.mdpi.com/journal/catalysts\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 759 2 of 38\ndirect, and alkaline dyes showed the highest toxicity [14]. In addition to the textile industry, hair dye [15], the leather industry [16], paper industry [17], photochemical batteries [18], and luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) technologies [19–21] also use a large amount of dyes. In order to effectively control environmental pollution and solve energy problems, it is an important task for researchers to develop efficient, stable, and green solutions. Solar energy is inexhaustible and its annual radiation energy to the surface of the Earth equivalent to about 140 trillion tons of coal burning energy. It belongs to the clean renewable pollution-free energy group and is thus the most promising energy to promote the rapid development of mankind in the future [22]. In 1972, Japanese scientists Fujishima and Honda [23] were the first to demonstrate photocatalytic splitting of water on a TiO2 electrode. Their work promotes the semiconductor photocatalysis widely used in the field of environment and energy, which opened the door of photocatalysis and has since attracted the interest of a large number of scientific researchers. In recent years, the research and development of a nano-TiO2 (nano-TiO2 generally refers to particles smaller than 100 nm in at least one dimension [24–26]) photocatalyst has developed rapidly and more and more achievements have been made. For TiO2, as the particle size decreases, its photocatalytic activity will increase to a certain extent, showing a specific size effect. Taken together, the possible size effects of nano-TiO2 photocatalytic materials are as follows: (1) Quantum size effect: TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor [27]. When its particle size is less than 50 nm, it will have different properties from single crystal semiconductors, which is called the “quantum size effect” [28]. That is, when the particle size drops to a certain value, the electron energy level near the Fermi level changes from a quasi-continuous to a discrete energy level or a widening energy gap. At this time, the potential of the conduction band becomes more negative, and the potential of the valence band becomes more positive, thereby increasing the energy of photogenerated electrons and holes, enhancing the redox capability of the semiconductor photocatalyst and improving its photocatalytic activity [29–31]. (2) Surface area effect: First, as the particle size decreases to the nanometer, the specific surface area of the photocatalyst will greatly increase as well as the number of surface atoms, so that the light absorption efficiency will be improved and the surface photocarrier concentration will increase accordingly, so the surface redox reaction efficiency is thus improved [32]. Second, as the particle size decreases, the specific surface area increases, and the bonding state and electronic state of the surface are different from the inside. The unsaturated coordination of surface atoms leads to an increase in surface active sites. Therefore, compared with powders of large particle sizes, their number of surface active sites are higher, so the adsorption capacity of the substrate is enhanced, and the reaction activity is increased [33]. In addition, the number of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst directly affects the catalytic activity during the photocatalytic reaction. When TiO2 powder is immersed in the aqueous solution, the surface undergoes a hydroxylation process. Therefore, as the size decreases, the specific surface area increases, and the number of surface hydroxyl groups also increases, thereby improving the reaction efficiency [34,35]. (3) Carrier diffusion effect: The grain size also has a great influence on the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers. For nanoscale semiconductor particles, the particle size is usually smaller than the thickness of the space charge layer, and any effect of the space charge layer can be ignored [36]. The smaller the particle, the shorter the time for photogenerated electrons to diffuse from the crystal to the surface, and the lower the probability of electron and hole recombination in the particle will be, which improves the photocatalytic efficiency [37–39]. There have been many outstanding studies on the synthesis and modification of TiO2 based photocatalysts and their applications in solving energy and environmental problems [40–42]. However, few articles have classified the environmental application of nano-TiO2 and compared the specific applications of nano-TiO2 based composites in various classifications [43–46]. By doping metal and nonmetal ions, introducing vacancy and fabricating composites with other semiconductors, the band\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 759 3 of 38\ngap of TiO2 was adjusted to make it have better photocatalytic activity [47]. In this review, we intend to summarize the applications of nano-TiO2 in environmental photocatalysis such as hydrogen production, carbon dioxide degradation, dye degradation, and nitrogen fixation. Finally, the current challenges and key issues of the nano-TiO2 photocatalyst are described, which need to be addressed in future research."

TiO2 Structures and Properties\nIn nature, TiO2 usually has three different crystal structures: anatase, rutile, and brookite [48]. In addition, there are several metastable crystal structures of TiO2 such as TiO2 (H) and TiO2II [49]. These metastable crystal structures can be obtained by artificial synthesis. Rutile is the most stable crystal form of TiO2. Even when the particle size is reduced to the nanometer level, rutile is still the most stable TiO2 anomaterial. Anatase and brookite can be transformed into r til at high temperature. Different crystal types of TiO2 usually exhibit different morphologies and properties. Therefore, the synthesis methods and conditions for different crystal types of TiO2 nanomaterials are also different. For example, the synthesis of anatase TiO2 nanomaterials usually requires solution synthesis or low temperature chemical vapor deposition, however, the synthesis of rutile TiO2 nanomaterials requires high temperature deposition or heating reaction [50].\nFigure 1 is the crystal structure of three different TiO2 phases, and the differences in crystal structures are quite evident. Rutile TiO2 has a tetragonal structure (Figure 1b), and its {011} and {100} crystal facets have the lowest energy, therefore, its thermodynamically stable morphology is a truncated octahedron. Anatase has a tetragonal structure, and its c-axis is longer than the a-axis (Figure 1a). Anatase TiO2 also has a low energy crystal plane, which is the same s rutile, so it can show as a truncated octahedron. The brookite belongs to an orthorhombic structure, and its structural unit is relatively larger, which is composed of eight TiO2 units (Figure 1c).\nFigure 1.

[51] calculated the electronic structure and the eff ctive mass of he carrier for anatase, rutile, and brookite TiO2 by using the plane-wave pseudopotential method, to prove that anatase has higher photocatalytic performance than rutile and brookite. The calculation results showed that rutile had the narrowest band gap of 1.86 eV, and the band gaps of anatase and brookite were 2.13 and 2.38 eV, respectively. However, anatase is an indirect band gap semiconductor, and rutile and\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 759 4 of 38\nbrookite both belong to the direct band gap semiconductor. Therefore, this leads to longer lifetimes of photogenerated electrons and holes for anatase than those for rutile and brookite. The valence bands of TiO2 in anatase, rutile, and brookite are mainly composed of O 2p and mixed with a few Ti 3d. Above the Fermi level, the conduction band is composed of Ti 3d, mixed with a small amount of O 2p and Ti 3p. The calculation results show that the anatase has a smaller average effective mass of photogenerated electrons and holes than rutile and brookite. The smaller the effective mass of the photogenerated electrons and holes, the easier it is for them to migrate, thus improving the photocatalytic activity. As anatase has a smaller effective mass and a longer lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes, in general, anatase TiO2 has a higher photocatalytic activity. The energy level structure of semiconductor material contains two aspects: energy level position and energy band width. The position of its energy level determines whether the photocatalytic reaction can take place, and the energy band width determines its light absorption range. The position of the titanium dioxide energy level is decisive for the photocatalytic reaction. From a thermodynamic point of view, when the reduction potential of the reactant is lower than the conduction band of the semiconductor material, a reduction reaction can occur; whereas when the oxidation potential is higher than the valence band of the semiconductor material, an oxidation reaction can occur [52]. Taking the photolysis of water as an example, the generation of H2 is the process of reducing H+ by photogenerated electrons, while the generation of O2 molecules is the process of oxidizing O2− by holes. The energy band position of TiO2 is suitable for the photolysis of water, because the valence band of TiO2 (+2.7 V, pH = 7) is lower than the redox potential of O2/H2O (+1.23 V, pH = 7) and the position of its conduction band (−0.5 V, pH = 7) is higher than the position of H2O/H2 redox potential (−0.41 V, pH = 7) [53]. In addition to the position of the energy level, the band width also has a very important effect on photocatalytic performance. For example, the band width (3.2 eV) of TiO2 is wide, so it can only absorb ultraviolet light. It is only possible to use visible light when TiO2 is doped with some metals, non-metallic elements, or combined with other semiconductors with smaller energy band widths. For example, g–C3N4 has a moderate forbidden band width (2.7 eV), and its conduction band position is very high (−1.3 V, pH = 7) [54]. Therefore, the combination of TiO2 and g–C3N4 can improve the utilization of visible light."

      "text" : "A large number of studies have shown that the morphology of nanomaterials has a very important effect on photocatalytic performance, because the morphology usually determines the exposure of the crystal plane and active site, specific surface area, electron, and hole transport rate and other factors. Zero-dimensional TiO2 nanomaterial has an isotropic structure and can expose all crystal planes (including those with higher energy), which is conducive to photocatalytic reactions. However, due to the quantum confinement effect, it has a larger forbidden band width and more surface defect states, making the photogenerated electrons and holes to have a higher recombination efficiency. If the surface can be properly modified, the recombination efficiency of electron-hole pairs can be greatly reduced, which is conducive to improving the photocatalytic performance of zero-dimensional TiO2 nanomaterials. This improved method has also been applied to many other zero-dimensional semiconductor nanomaterials such as carbon dots [55,56], CdS [57], CdSe [58], and graphene quantum dots [59,60]. The one-dimensional structure of TiO2 such as nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes possesses a very fast charge transfer rate in a single direction, and the electron-hole pair has a relatively low recombination efficiency, making it an important research object for photocatalytic reactions [61,62]. Two-dimensional TiO2 nanosheets are very thin, with large specific surface area and effective absorption area, and the rate of charge transfer is also very fast. Therefore, two-dimensional sheet TiO2 material is also widely used in photocatalysis [63,64].

The lower wall thickness was about 65 nm and the upper wall thickness was about 12 nm. The diameter of the internal pipe increased gradually from about 50 nm to 110 nm. Fang et al.

These nanometer flowers were completely assembled from TiO2 nanometer flakes with a size of about 2.0 µm, with a thickness of about 10–20 nm and a length of about 1.2 µm. The submicron scale hollow sphere of TiO2 not only has a large specific surface, but also has a size near the wavelength of UV–Vis. Therefore, in theory, diffraction and reflection caused by shell structure on the hollow sphere can improve the utilization rate of light [69].

Since the energy barrier to be crossed for shallow or deep transitions is smaller than the intrinsic band gap of the semiconductor, visible light can excite shallow transitions and, in most cases, deep transitions.\nFigure 3. Effects of metal doping on band structure of semiconductors: (a) shallow donor level, (b) shallow acceptor level, (c) deep donor level, and (d) deep acceptor level formed by metal doping.\nMetal doping can indeed introduce impurity levels into the wideband gap semiconductor band, and these impurity levels can also induce the absorption of visible light, but not always the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency under visible light. The current widely accepted explanation for this problem is that metal dopants may become the composite centers of photogenerated electrons and holes (especially the formed deep impurity level) in semiconductor materials, thus failing to improve (or even reduce) the visible light activity of semiconductor materials. Moreover, the visible light activity of semiconductor materials is affected by the type of doping elements, the doping method (chemical\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 759 7 of 38\nsynthesis, atmospheric heat treatment, magnetron sputtering, etc.), the doping amount, the doping position (substitution or clearance), and the doping distribution (volume or surface).\n2.3.2. Non-Metal Doping\nDue to the bottleneck problem of metal doping, non-metal doping research has gradually become the mainstream since 2001, when Asahi et al. [85] reported the visible activity of N-doped TiO2. In the past decade, important progress has been made in studies on non-metal doping including synthesis, characterization, mechanism research, and performance. According to the band theory of semiconductors, the energy band of the semiconductor is a new molecular orbital formed by the hybridization of atomic orbitals of constituent atoms. The conduction band and valence band of most transition metal oxides (including TiO2) are mainly composed of 3d metal orbital and 2p oxygen orbital, respectively. Again, on the basis of molecular orbital theory, when some of the oxygen atoms in the lattice of TiO2 are replaced with an element that is less electronegative than oxygen, the electron orbitals of the doping elements with the 2p orbital of oxygen forms a new molecular orbital with lower energy than the 2p orbital of oxygen, that is, the top of valence band formed by this new molecular orbital is higher than the top of the valence band formed by the 2p orbital of oxygen. However, the 3d orbit of the titanium forming the conduction band does not change, so it can be seen that through the doping of elements with lower electronegativity than oxygen, the bottom of the conduction band for titanium dioxide remains unchanged, and the top of the valence band is increased, thus reducing the band gap of TiO2. In fact, most non-metallic elements are less electronegative than oxygen, which can be used to reduce the band gap of TiO2 through doping. In addition, a suitable dopant element, in addition to the requirement of electronegativity, should have an ion radius similar to that of oxygen ions in order to achieve atomic substitution doping.\n2.3.3. Vacancy\nHeteroatomic doping of semiconductors also typically introduces vacancies in the lattice. Vacancy is one of the defects of intrinsic characteristics in semiconductor materials such as oxygen vacancy in oxides and nitrogen vacancy in nitrides. Vacancy can introduce a defect level into the band gap of the semiconductor (for example, the defect level of the oxygen vacancy is located below the conduction band), thus causing visible light absorption of the semiconductor material. There are many studies on vacancy (especially oxygen vacancy [86,87]), and in most cases, the presence of vacancy can improve the catalytic activity of semiconductor materials. For example, the introduction of nitrogen vacancy in g–C3N4 can effectively improve the photodissociation performance of aquatic hydrogen [88]. In addition, the presence of defect levels can even enable the insulator SiO2 (band gap > 8 eV) to have the capability of photocatalytic hydrogen production [89].\n2.3.4. Composites\nPhotoelectron and hole in semiconductor materials are mostly recombined in the process of bulk phase diffusion or transferred to the surface, and only a few electrons and holes participate in redox reaction, which is the most fundamental factor that limits the photocatalytic activity of semiconductor materials. For a single material, a defect on its surface (such as a vacancy, etc.) will become the trapping pit of an electron or hole, thus causing the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, but the separation is finite. To obtain more separated electrons and holes, researchers have used carrier transfers between composite semiconductors over the past few decades. Figure 4a shows the carrier transfer in the semiconductor sensitization process, which mainly expands the light absorption range of composite semiconductor materials. Generally, the semiconductor with narrow band gap and high conduction band is combined with a semiconductor with a wide band gap and low conduction band (such as TiO2, ZnO, etc.). In this kind of composite semiconductor material, the electrons, which can be excited by visible light to the conduction band of the narrow band\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 759 8 of 38\ngap semiconductor, are transferred to the conduction band of a wideband gap semiconductor under the drive of energy level difference. If two semiconductor materials with staggered energy levels are combined to form a type II semiconductor heterostructure, the carrier transfer between them is shown in Figure 4b. Electrons transfer from a semiconductor with a high conduction band to a semiconductor with a low conduction band under the action of energy level difference, while holes transfer from a semiconductor with a low valence band to a semiconductor with a high valence band, thus facilitating the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. So far, most semiconductor materials can find another semiconductor material matching its energy level, and form this type II semiconductor heterostructure, and type II energy level arrangement is also the most commonly used in semiconductor combination of the semiconductor heterostructure. For example, ZnS/ZnO [90], SnO2/ZnO [91], TiO2/WO3 [92], g–C3N4/WO3 [93], etc. If the semiconductor materials that make up the type II semiconductor heterostructure are p-type and n-type, respectively, and their band edges are arranged as shown in Figure 4c, then the built-in electric field in the p-n junction will further increase the carrier transfer to promote greater separation of photogenerated carriers on semiconductors. Such semiconductor heterostructures are p-In2O3/n-ZnO [94], p-CaFe2O4/n-ZnO [95], p-NiO/n-ZnO [96], and p-ZnO/n-TiO2 [97], etc. The above-mentioned type II semiconductor heterostructure can promote the separation of photogenerated carriers of semiconductors, but there are also unfavorable factors, that is, the carriers are all transferred to the low energy level, thereby the reduction and oxidation capacity of photogenerated electrons and holes is reduced. If the separation of photogenerated carriers can be achieved while maintaining their ability for oxidation and reduction, it will be beneficial for the application of semiconductor heterostructures in photocatalysis. For this, the research in some specific II type semiconductor heterostructures (for example, the CdS/ZnO [98], WO3/CaFe2O4 [99], CdS/WO3 [100], BiOI/g–C3N4 [101], etc.) puts forward the concept of the mechanism of the vector Z carrier transfer (Figure 4d). Taking CdS/ZnO as an example, during the carrier transfer process of the vectorial Z-scheme mechanism, the photogenerated electrons on ZnO and the photogenerated holes on CdS recombine at the interface, thus, the photogenerated electrons on CdS with stronger reducibility and the photo-generated holes on ZnO with stronger oxidability are retained.\nCatalysts 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 37 but the separation is finite. To obtain more separated electrons and holes, researchers have used carrier transfers between composite semiconductors over the past few decades. Figure 4a shows the carrier transfer in the semiconductor sensitization process, which mainly expands the light absorption range of composite semiconductor materials. Generally, the semiconductor with narrow band gap and high conduction band is combined with a semiconductor with a wide band gap and low conduction band (such as TiO2, ZnO, etc.). In this kind of composite semiconductor material, the electrons, which can be excited by visible light to the conduction band of the narrow band gap semiconductor, are transferred to the conduction band of a wideband gap semiconductor under the drive of energy level difference. If two semiconductor materials with staggered energy levels are combined to form a type II semiconductor heterostructure, the carrier transfer between them is shown in Figure 4b. Electrons transfer from a semiconductor with a high conduction band to a semiconductor with a low conduction band under the action of energy level difference, while holes transfer from a semiconductor with a low valence band to a semiconductor with a high valence band, thus facilitating the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. So far, most semiconductor materials can find another semiconductor material matching its energy level, and form this type II semiconductor heterostructure, and type II energy level arrangement is also the most commonly used in semiconductor combination of the semiconductor heterostructure. For example, ZnS/ZnO [90], SnO2/ZnO [91], TiO2/WO3 [92], g–C3N4/WO3 [93], etc. If the semiconductor materials that make up the type II semiconductor heterostructure are ptype and n-type, respectively, and their band edges are arranged as shown in Figure 4c, then the built-in electric field in the p-n junction will further increase the carrier transfer to promote greater separation of photogenerated carriers on semiconductors. Such semiconductor heterostructures are p-In2O3/n-ZnO [94], p-CaFe2O4/n-ZnO [95], p-NiO/n-ZnO [96], and p-ZnO/n-TiO2 [97], etc. The above-mentioned type II semiconductor heterostructure can promote the separation of photogenerated carriers of semiconductors, but there are also unfavorable factors, that is, the carriers are all transferred to the low energy level, thereby the reduction and oxidation capacity of photogenerated electrons and holes is reduced.

So far, a number of methods have been implemented to obtain hydrogen such as chemical, physical, or electrocatalytic hydrogen production [102–104]. In these methods, photocatalytic hydrogen production [105,106] has developed rapidly because it is clean, cheap, and environmentally friendly. Many materials with excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production properties have been reported such as ZnO [107], MoS2 [108], etc. In particular, TiO2 [109,110], which has physical and chemical stability, a unique energy band structure and photochemical activity, was first reported in 1972 [23], and has since been a research hot spot. The principle of photocatalytic hydrogen production is shown in Figure 5 [111,112]. Photocatalysis has four main processes in Figure 5, namely, light collection (stage 1), the electron excites from the valence band to the conduction band (stage 2), photogenerated electrons and holes separation and transfer (stages 3 and 4), and surface redox reactions (stages 5 and 6) [54]. First, the energy required for photocatalysis needs to be above or equal to the band gap of the semiconductor. Generally, the semiconductor consists of the valence band and the conduction band, which are separated from each other by the forbidden band [113]. Under the appropriate conditions, the photocatalyst excites to produce electron and hole pairs (e− + h+) (Equation (1)), the electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band. The recombination of photoelectrons and photoholes also occurs as Equation (2). Photogenerated electrons and holes participate in the redox reactions in water. The oxidation reaction is that the water reacts with h+ to produce O2, as shown in Equation (3), while Equation (4) shows the reduction reaction is that H+ gains e+ to produce H2.

First, rutile is thermodynamically stable, while anatase is metastable [121,122]. Second, rutile exhibits more effective charge separation due to fewer defects in its crystal, because the defect is the recombination center of the photogenerated electron-hole pair [123]. Most importantly, rutile titanium dioxide has a smaller band gap (3.02 eV) than anatase (3.20 eV) [124–126]. Therefore, in theory, rutile TiO2 has greater potential as a photocatalyst. However, due to the high photogenerated electrons and holes recombination rate of rutile TiO2, it usually shows a lower photocatalytic performance than anatase TiO2 [127–129]. Inspired by the concept of “surface heterojunction” [130], Chaomin Gao et al. [131] introduced the facet heterojunction (FH) strategy to promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in rutile TiO2 by building 3D layered nanostructures to obtain higher photocatalytic activity. A 3D rutile TiO2 photocatalyst was prepared on the surface of TiO2 nanorods (NRs) coated with ultrathin TiO2 nanocrystalline sheets. This 3D rutile TiO2 contained countless FH, which are formed by nanosheets with different levels on the interface between the coated nanosheets and the nanorod substrate. In order to clarify its high activity, FH-TiO2 was compared with rutile TiO2, anatase TiO2, and P25, and the yield of H2 production for FH-TiO2 was 1.441 mmol g−1 h−1, which was much higher than the other photocatalysts (Figure 6).\nCatalysts 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 37\nH2O + h+ → O2 + 2H+ (3) 2e− + 2H+ → H2 (4)\nRCH2OH + 2h+ → RCHO + 2H+ (5) The photocatalytic ability of rutile TiO2 is in principle superior to anatase [120].

[154] synthesized a TiO2 nanofilm doped with Ag, and this composite film showed a greater hydrogen production activity with an average hydrogen production rate of 147.9 ± 35.5 μmol h−1 g−1 than TiO2. Using calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), Mazheika et al. [155] found that Ag could modify the surface of anatase TiO2, resulting in defects such as oxygen vacancy when Ag was introduced into the TiO2 lattice [156]. With these vacancies, a transmission channel with high conductivity can be created, thereby effectively separating electrons from holes [157]. Yingfeng Xu et al. [158] developed a particularly simple and effective palladium catalytic strategy for hydrogenation of TiO2. The point defects (Ti3+ and oxygen vacancy) in TiO2 significantly narrow the band gap and improve the activity of TiO2. In addition, due to the oxygen assistance, the autothermal effect generated during palladium-catalyzed hydrogenation induces a unique crystalline core/disordered shell structure, which is believed to prevent photogenerated electors and holes from recombination and is conducive to the cycling stability of TiO2 after redox reduction. This simple and universal palladium catalytic hydrogenation method will open up new ways to produce inherent defects in oxides and greatly improve catalytic performance. Non-metallic element doped TiO2 has obvious advantages due to its unique characteristics of small ionic radius, high thermal stability, and few recombination centers. Studies have shown that N or S [159–161] doped TiO2 can narrow the optical band gap and increase photocatalytic activity. Recently, a series of N-doped TiO2 nanobelts have been reported by Shuchao Sun et al. [162]. The unique shape of the nanobelt provides well-defined nanostructures with (101) and (001) faces on exposed surfaces. The maximum hydrogen yield rate of these N-doped TiO2 nanoribbon is 670 μmolh−1g−1, much higher than other values reported in the previous TiO2 nanobelt conventional literature (only a few μmol h−1g−1). S doped TiO2 was prepared by oxidative annealing of TiS2 as reported by Umebayashi et al. [163]. At the annealing temperature of 600 °C, a part of TiS2 was transformed to anatase TiO2.

As the narrowing of the band gap is caused by the upward migration of valence bands, the conduction band remains unchanged, so S-doped TiO2 can produce hydrogen in visible light. In photocatalysis, TiO2 can be combined with other semiconductors to extend the absorption wavelength range to the visible region and slow down electron-hole recombination [164,165]. Kim et al. [166] reported a new system using a TiO2 photocatalyst loaded with Bi2S3 (Bi2S3/TiO2). Bi2S3 particles are similar to the shape of a sea urchin, with a length of about 2–3 nm and a diameter of 15–20 nm. Compared with pure TiO2 and Bi2S3, Bi2S3/TiO2 composite material has enhanced hydrogen generation capacity in methanol/water (1:1) system. Chai et al. [167] reported g–C3N4–Pt–TiO2 nanocomposite was prepared by simple chemical adsorption and calcination. Through a series of characterization, it was found that the photocatalytic activity of the composites could be significantly improved. The photocurrent stability of g–C3N4–TiO2 is about 1.5 times that of g–C3N4. Due to the synergistic effect between Pt–TiO2 and g–C3N4, the photogenerated electrons of g–C3N4 can transform to Pt–TiO2, and the photogenerated electrons and holes can be effectively separated, which can effectively hinder the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes and improve the photocatalytic activity. Some typical examples of improving photocatalytic activity are described above, which have given us great inspiration. In addition, Table 1 lists the basic methods commonly used in the literature to improve photocatalytic activity such as metal doping, non-metal doping, and composites. Through comparison, it can be seen that in the process of photocatalytic hydrogen production, due to the advantages of the nanosheet structure, most materials were synthesized into thinner nanosheets in order to seek rapid electron migration to the surface and therefore improve catalytic activity. The highest activities were Co (III)/TiO2 and F–TiO2, showing that metal and non-metal doping could significantly improve the photocatalytic activity. Doping is the simplest and easiest way to improve photocatalytic activity. In the process of composites, two or three semiconductors with suitable band structures are usually combined so that the photogenerated electrons can be separated effectively. However, due to the complexity of the implementation method, it is not conducive to large-scale industrial production."

      "text" : "With the improvement in industrialization, the mass production rate of dyes has increased, so effective waste water treatment is needed [179]. Therefore, many methods have been developed to treat this apparent challenge, but these physical techniques (e.g., activated carbon adsorption and resin adsorption, reverse osmosis, extraction, ultrafiltration) simply transfer contaminants from one medium to another, causing secondary pollution. This usually requires further treatment of the absorbent or extractant, which increases the cost of the process. In recent years, extensive studies have been carried\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 759 14 of 38\nout on a wide range of synthetic dyes. Since 1972, when TiO2 was first used for photocatalytic hydrogen production, photocatalysis has attracted much attention. Since the electron with energy generated by TiO2 under light degraded the dyes, a series of catalysts were developed for the photocatalytic degradation of dyes. Among the different types of photocatalysts, photocatalytic oxidation assisted by titanium dioxide (TiO2) has attracted much attention in recent years due to its non-toxicity, strong oxidation capacity, and long-term optical stability [180]. The introduction of carbon nanotubes (CNT) into nano-TiO2 to prepare highly active photocatalyst has attracted the attention of many researchers [181–184]. These reports indicate that when decorated with CNT, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 can be observably enhanced. It has been indicated that CNT is an electron acceptor, hinders the recombination of electrons and holes, and increases the superficial area of TiO2 and the number of active sites. Azzam et al. [185] successfully synthesized the nano-composite materials by CNT, TiO2, and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) for the photodegradation of dyes. The synthesized catalyst was modified with a cationic surfactant to increase the dispersion of TiO2 and reduce the surface interaction (TiO2@CNT/AgNPs/C10). The results of N2 gas adsorption and desorption showed that the obtained material had a large specific surface area. Due to the co-modification of Ag nanoparticles and CNT, the TiO2 composite had a lower band gap (2.25 eV).

In general, the smaller the size of NPs, the more active sites they provide [187]. However, the bonding properties between metals and semiconductors are largely dependent on the properties of ligands on the metal surface (organic ligands are often added to avoid NP aggregation in solution) and organic ligands on the metal surface form a physical barrier that prevents the reactants from spreading to the active site and the transfer of electrons from the nano-TiO2 to the noble metal [188]. Haiguang Zhu et al. [189] synthesized a photocatalyst for TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) doped with gold nanoclusters (Au NCs), which are protected by per-6-thio-β-cyclodextrin (SH-β-SD).The use of SH-β-SD facilitates the formation of an interface between Au NCs and TiO2, thus forming an effective photocatalyst and overcoming the disadvantages of organic ligands in the synthesis of traditional photocatalysts. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by MO (Methyl Orange) degradation. As shown in Figure 11, TiO2–Au NCs– β–CD exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for MO degradation under UV light than other composite materials. In particular, over 98% of the MO was degraded using TiO2–Au NCs–β–CD within 10 min, while about 47% of the MO was degraded using TiO2.\nTiO2 doping includes u, g, Pt, and other noble etal nanoparticles ( Ps) that can effectively promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, and the noble etal can also act as an active site for the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes [137,186].

Alam U et al. [200] synthesized a Bi-doped TiO2NT/graphene composite catalyst by the hydrothermal method. The synergic effect of Bi and graphene embedded in TiO2 nanotubes promoted the interface charge transfer and improved the visible light efficiency. Wang Weikang et al. [201] synthesized a boron-doped TiO2 (a/r adjustable) photocatalyst by the one-step roasting method. The electron transfer occurring in the two-phase interface is conducive to charge separation, and the charge trap is provided by the b-less electron structure, which improves the degradation capacity of atrazine.

The carbon plane of the graphene layer makes full contact with the ternary heterojunction, improves the efficiency of charge separation, and inhibits photocatalytic electron-hole pair recombination. In addition to degrading dyes, TiO2 is also used to degrade other pollutants such as antibiotics, heavy metals, and toxic gases. Pengzhao Ya et al. [205] reported that based on the hard-soft acid-base (HSAB) principle, TiO2 was directly compounded with NH2–UiO–66 to synthesize a TiO2@NH2–UiO–66 nanocomposite used for the photocatalytic degradation of styrene. Due to the porosity of MOF, the quaternary ammonium salt around TiO2 can be well encapsulated, thereby prolonging its residence time at the photocatalytic active site and improving the activity. This method can form a good contact interface between TiO2 and NH2–UiO–66, and can effectively promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Compared with blank TiO2 and NH2–UiO–66, the degradation efficiency is significantly improved. The TiO2@NH2–UiO–66 photocatalyst has good stability, and the photocatalytic activity can last 600 min without obvious deactivation. Haibo Sheng et al. [206] prepared TiO2@MIL-101 double-shell hollow particles for the photocatalytic degradation of H2S, showing good activity. The conversion rate of hydrogen sulfide can reach up to 90.1%, which is obviously improved when compared with hollow and blank TiO2. The reaction reached equilibrium in 60 min, which is a significant improvement compared to hollow TiO2. Due to its excellent H2S adsorption capacity, MIL-101 can significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity. In addition to the above methods, Table 2 lists common ways to improve the degradation activity of photocatalytic dyes, which are similar to those in photocatalytic hydrogen production. Since the dyes have no energy level requirements for other applications, the implementation is relatively simple, and it can be seen that nanotubes and nanometers TiO2 have advantages. From the perspective of activity, the [Pt3(CO)6]62−–TiO2 photocatalyst with noble metal Pt had the highest activity, but due to different degradation dyes and different final degradation rates, it was difficult to compare the difference in activity. From a rough perspective, TiO2 doped with a noble metal such as Ag and Pt have a high activity, but has a high price. Transition metal doping showed higher activity than non-metal doping, showing an advantage in dye degradation. The composites showed high degradation rates, but it took a long time to degrade.\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 759 18 of 38"

      "text" : "Over the past few decades, the massive increase in CO2 and the focus on energy supply are considered as the greatest challenges of this century. Converting CO2 into renewable fuels through artificial photosynthesis has been considered as the best way to avoid both energy and environmental problems. Since Inoue [222] reported that semiconductors can reduce CO2 in water, efforts have been made to build more efficient and environmentally friendly photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Up to now, most photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions using metal oxide semiconductor photocatalysts have been conducted under ultraviolet light or high power light irradiation, which is not suitable for practical production [223,224]. Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is similar to natural photosynthesis, in which plants convert CO2 and H2O to oxygen and carbohydrates under sunlight. In this process, solar energy is transformed and stored in the form of carbohydrates. It is a combination of water oxidation reaction and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (or CO2 fixation reaction), involving light and dark reaction [225]. Due to the difference in obtained products, the difficulty of photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction is different, but in order to improve the activity of the TiO2 photocatalyst, most studies still adopt the simple strategy of metal or nonmetal doping or composites. Andreu et al. [226] applied Mg loaded on the surface of TiO2 (rutile type, anatase type, plate titanium type) nanoparticles for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, and the products were CO and CH4. A little Mg can increase the concentration of Ti3+ (as an electron trap) and modified oxygen (as a hole trap), thereby reducing the charge recombination rate and increasing the activity of the catalyst. Tseng et al. [227] prepared a TiO2-supported Cu catalyst by the sol-gel method, and orderly modified Cu distribution on the catalyst surface after post-treatment. Under ultraviolet light, the CH3OH produced by the system was the greatest (1000 µmol·g−1). Dispersed Cu(I) is considered as a key site for catalytic reduction. When Cu(I) changes to Cu(0) or its aggregates, the catalytic activity of the system decreases. Xie et al. [228] supported different metal oxides (MgO, SrO, CaO, BaO, La2O3, Lu2O3) on the surface of a TiO2/Pt catalyst. The study showed that the content of CH4 for the MgO–TiO2 composite was the highest. After the CO2 molecule is absorbed in MgO, it becomes more concentrated, its structure is more unstable, and it is easier for it to participate in the reaction. Using TiO2 (P25) as the framework, Li et al. [229] synthesized the CuO/TiO2 catalyst (CuO mass fraction was 32%) by the dipping method. Using Na2SO3 as a sacrificial agent, the yield of reduced products CH3OH and C2H5OH in water was 12.5 and 27.1 µmol/gk, respectively. The most important problem limiting the widespread use of TiO2 is the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. At present, the heterogeneous structure strategy has been proposed to inhibit recombination [230,231]. However, a single heterojunction had almost no effect on\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 759 19 of 38\nfacilitating the separation of electrons and holes. Therefore, the construction of multiple heterostructures is necessary for the collaborative improvement of interface electron–hole separation and migration. Recently, a catalyst involving the design of an m–s junction with a p–n junction has been reported [232]. Compared with a single junction, the interaction of multiple heterojunctions results in the synergistic improvement of photocatalytic activity. As the distribution of the multiple heterogeneous structures on the surface of the photocatalyst is irregular, the effect of photogenerated electrons and holes is still poor. It has been reported that, on account of the difference in the electronic structure of anatase TiO2 {101} and {001} faces, heterostructure can be carried out in different planes to separate the electrons and holes in space and aggregate on the {101} and {001} faces, respectively [223]. Therefore, Aiyun Meng et al. [233] designed one to construct the p–n junction with MnOx on the TiO2 {001} surface to facilitate hole migration from TiO2 to the p-type semiconductor, and the m–n junction with Pt on the TiO2 {101} surface for electron migration from TiO2 to metal. The synthesized catalyst had a good hole–electron pair separation capability and a high photocatalytic activity. After three hours of light exposure, the maximum yield of CH4 and CH3OH reached 104 and 91 µmol m−2, respectively, which was higher than that of pure TiO2 and TiO2/Pt, and the catalyst had good stability (Figure 14).

Compared with the blank catalyst, taurine treatment improved the selectivity of CH4 on the photocatalyst surface, while ethylenediamine treatment improved the selectivity of CO on the photocatalyst surface. Although the same Cu2O/TiO2 photocatalyst was used, the product selectivity was significantly changed. Due to the difference in the number of electrons produced in the reaction, for example, different numbers of electrons are needed for CO2 to degrade both CO and CH4, and the ligand-treated samples (*TAU and *EDA) showed an overall enhanced photocatalytic activity. The selectivity of the products of CH4 and CO was quite different from that of the blank photocatalyst. As shown in Figure 15, the CH4 produced by *TAU was 2.4 times that of the blank sample, and the CO was 3.3 times less that of the blank sample; while the CO production rate of *EDA increased by more than 2.0 times, and the production of CH4 was even less than that of the blank sample.\nFigure 14.

Reprinted with permission from [237].\nPhotocatalytic degradation of CO2 is a multiple step process including adsorption, CO2 activation, and CO2 bond dissociation [238,239]. However, the reported photocatalytic composites for CO2 reduction showed low CO2 adsorption. Activated carbon fibers (ACFs) have recently been identified as an aussichtsreich large surface area base material that can effectively adsorb CO2 [240,241]. Ajit et al. [242] synthesized a NiO/TiO2 photocatalyst supported on an activated carbon fiber (ACF) (Figure 16). The layered porous structure and large surface area of ACF can better absorb CO2. NiO/TiO2 provides a catalytic surface for the photocatalytic degradation of CO2 under visible light irradiation.

      "heading" : "6. Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation",
      "text" : "Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most important products in today’s chemical industry. It is the key raw material for the synthesis of various nitrogen-containing compounds [258]. Through the Haber–Bosch process invented in the early 20th century, NH3 is produced by the hydrogenation of N2, which consumes 2% global energy by humans each year and releases large amounts of greenhouse gases (CO2 produced when fossil fuels are burned to provide heat) into the atmosphere [259]. Introducing solar or electrical energy instead of heat into nitrogen fixation reduces energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions [260]. Among them, due to photocatalytic nitrogen fixation realized under mild conditions, it is considered as one of the most advanced ammonia synthesis methods. Schrauzer et al. [261] first reported TiO2 as a photocatalyst for the reaction. Subsequently, it has been demonstrated that a variety of semiconductors including Fe2O3 [262], WO3 [239], and BiOBr [263] have photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activities. Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation is a newly developed branch in recent years, and there are few studies available. Currently, most studies are focused on doping TiO2 to obtain higher performance. Of course, composites are also an appropriate strategy for nitrogen fixation. Weirong Zhao et al. [264] successfully prepared Fe-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with high (1 0 1) face ratio by the two-step hydrothermal method. When ethanol is used as a hole-trapping agent, quantum yield can reach 18.27 × 10−2 m−2, which is 3.84 times higher than blank TiO2. Fe3+ ions uniformly mixed into anatase crystal and replaced Ti4+ in TiO2 lattice can increase the density of charge carrier concentration to improve nitrogen fixation activity. Daimei Chen et al. [265] prepared three codoped nanoparticles of C-doped TiO2, N-doped TiO2, and C/N-doped TiO2 by the simple sol-gel method. It is found that doping C and N atoms can inhibit the crystal growth of TiO2. The influence of C doping is more obvious than that of N doping. N atoms can replace oxygen atoms in the lattice of anatase, while most C atoms are deposited on the surface. The results of nitrogen fixation showed that the C–N–TiO2 nanomaterial showed the highest photocatalytic activity. Liu et al. [266] used a MXene derivative to synthesize the TiO2@C/g–C3N4 heterojunction, and has rich surface defects, high electron donating ability, appropriate light capture, excellent charge transfer, and the strong ability of nitrogen activation. Excellent optical performance of the catalytic reduction of ammonia nitrogen is thus obtained, and NH3 formation rate was 250.6 µmol h−1 g−1 under Vis. The presence of defects in semiconductor photocatalysts has attracted extensive attention as an active site for reactions [267]. Recent studies have shown that a defective catalyst can be activated at a wavelength of 500 nm. It was proven that a thin catalyst could effectively improve the separation of the electron and hole [268]. Yunxuan Zhao et al. [269] synthesized Cu-doped TiO2 nanosheets by using the Jahn–Teller distortion strategy, thus introducing a large number of oxygen vacancies and showing a wide range of solar absorption (Figure 18). The experiment showed that the TiO2 nanosheets doped with Cu had a higher hole–electron separation efficiency and a higher nitrogen fixation activity. TiO2 nanosheets doped with 6% Cu showed an activity of 78.9 µmol g−1 h−1 under full light irradiation, which was 1.54 and 0.72 µmol g−1 h−1under 600 nm and 700 nm monochromatic excitation, respectively.\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 759 23 of 38 Catalysts 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 23 of 37\nFigure 18.

Reprinted with permission from [269].\nGreat efforts have been made to narrow the semiconductor band gap and reduce the photogenic electron–hole recombination rate [270–272]. Meanwhile, morphology adjustment has also been proven to be an effective means to improve photocatalytic activity [273]. For example, photocatalysts for core-shell structured nanoparticles exhibit the ability to modulate light propagation due to their unique morphology. Nanotubes with hollow structure and high specific surface area have higher light utilization due to multiple scattering effects. Shiqun Wu et al. [274] reported a photocatalyst with a high specific surface area and a large number of defects in hollow TiO2 nanotubes. These two features in favor of the capture of light and photo-induced electron and hole separation, so as to promote the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity. First of all, the hollow is good for collecting light. Second, rich defects on TiO2 nanotubes (oxygen vacancy and Ti3+) with larger surface area (344 m2/g), are the active sites of nitrogen adsorption to improve the photocatalytic activity (Figure 19). Under the light, the titanium dioxide nanotubes show high and stable production of ammonia (106.6 μmolg−1 h−1).\nFigure 19. Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation mechanism by TiO2 (B) nanotubes. Reprinted with permission from [274].\nRecently, Li et al. [275] found that the oxygen vacancy (Ovac) in BiOBr nanosheets has the ability to absorb and reduce N2 to NH3. Similarly, Ovac in TiO2 has the same capacity in the adsorption and reduction of N2, which can be illustrated by the photocatalysis of N2 under ultraviolet light by the TiO2 photocatalyst containing Ovac [276]. However, when methods such as H2 reduction are used to introduce Ovac, they cannot avoid the formation of body defects, which will cause photogenic electron–hole pair recombination [277]. Jiangpeng Wang et al. [278] reported that TiO2 nanotubes with less oxygen vacancy were prepared by treating hydrogenated TiO2 with dicyandiamide (DA) to repair the body defects. Electron spin resonance (ESR) results showed that the sample exhibited a strong paramagnetic peak due to a large number of oxygen vacancies and body defects after\ni r .

However, the band gap of TiO2 corresponds to the Ultraviolet (UV) region, which is inactive under visible irradiation. At present, TiO2 has become activated in the visible light region by metal and nonmetal doping and the fabrication of composites. Recently, nano-TiO2 has attracted much attention due to its characteristics of larger specific surface area and more exposed surface active sites. nano-TiO2 has been obtained in many morphologies such as ultrathin nanosheets, nanotubes, and hollow nanospheres. This work focuses on the application of nano-TiO2 in efficient environmental photocatalysis such as hydrogen production, dye degradation, CO2 degradation, and nitrogen fixation, and discusses the methods to improve the activity of nano-TiO2 in the future.",
