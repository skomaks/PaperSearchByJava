Their potential applications range from biomedical, drug delivery, environmental, photocatalytic to energy storage sectors. Among these, investigations have largely focused on their behavior in environmental sensing, biosensing, and optoelectronics, yet energy storage and conversion systems are progressing rapidly as new promising methods are emerging to solve some of the outstanding challenges with energy at low cost and environmental footprint. By virtue of their rapid electron transfer and high surface area, CQD/GQDs are desirable in these electrochemical applications. Further, functional groups with rich heteroatoms (oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, boron) on 0D carbon nanomaterials offer desirable active sites for enhanced electrochemical properties. Our review presents recent advances in the fabrication of CQD/GQD based composites for electrochemical systems, their mechanism of action, applications in energy storage (electrochemical capacitors, lithium/sodium ion batteries) and electrocatalysis (oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions, CO2 electroreduction, biofuel cells and electrochemical biosensors) with an analysis of their potential prospects."

      "text" : "Increasing demands for energy conversion and storage, coupled with environmental concerns of global warming and fossil fuel depletion, have spawned intense exploration of renewables, alternative energy storage and conversion technologies based on supercapacitors, lithium/sodium ion batteries, metal-air batteries, fuel cells and electrocatalytic water splitting [1–3]. Since their initial commercialization in 1991, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have found wide usage in applications ranging from vehicle electrification to portable electronics due to their long lifespan and high energy density [4,5]. However, chronic shortages in lithium supply constrain the production of LIBs to meet growing energy demands. Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been emerging as potential alternatives to LIBs because of the natural abundance and low cost of sodium [6,7]. Nevertheless, sluggish reaction kinetics due to the large ionic radius (1.02 Å) of sodium results in low capacity, poor cyclic durability and inferior rate capability [6]. Similarly, though supercapacitors as energy storage devices have demonstrated advantages of high power density, fast charge/discharge rate and long cyclic stability [8], their widespread application has been inhibited by low energy density compared to conventional LIBs [9].\nThus, developing superior materials for producing high performance batteries and supercapacitors at low cost is necessary for overcoming the existing challenges.\nEnergy conversion systems based on metal-air batteries, fuel cells and electrocatalytic water splitting are being considered as alternatives to fossil fuels. High performing electrocatalysts for cathodic and anodic reactions are key for the success of these systems. The current state-ofthe-art electrocatalysts are Pt/Pt-based materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and Ru/Ir and Ru/Ir-based composites for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their superior electrocatalytic activities [10,11]. However, the sluggish ORR kinetics of the cathodes, even at high Pt loading, together with their scarcity and high cost have hindered their wider applications in both fuel cells and electrocatalytic water splitting [12–14]. Therefore, reducing noble metal loading without sacrificing electrocatalytic performance or replacing them with nonprecious, abundant metals is highly desirable.\nCarbon nanomaterials, because of their outstanding physical and chemical properties of high electronic conductivity, large surface area, and chemical inertness have been favoured as electrode materials in various electrochemical systems [15]. Among these carbon materials,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104093 Received 12 June 2019; Received in revised form 30 August 2019; Accepted 2 September 2019\n∗ Corresponding author.

All rights reserved.\nT\ncarbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene have widely been shown to have enhanced electrical conductivity, reduced electron transfer resistance and increased dispersion of active materials [14]. Nevertheless, the synthesis of these carbon nanomaterials at scale is still relatively expensive, while bulk conventional carbon materials lack sufficient activity for electrocatalysis. To overcome this drawback, heteroatom doping is often undertaken to facilitate catalytic activity, yet the doping process is time-consuming and incurs additional costs.\nWidely known in sensing and biomedicine, carbon dots are often categorized into carbon nanodots and graphene quantum dots, differentiated based on their surface functional groups and inner structure [16]. Carbon dots have drawn significant attention due to their exceptional properties of size, luminescence, low toxicity, photostability, diminished photobleaching, biocompatibility, electrocatalysis, multiphoton excitation, up-converted photoluminescence and chemiluminescence. The mass production of carbon dots can be achieved by facile synthetic approaches including hydrothermal, electrochemical, chemical and microwave-assisted methods, and pyrolysis of organic substances [17]. The synthesis and growth mechanism of pure and heteroatom doped CQDs/GQDs are given elsewhere [17–21]. Their quantum size allows their usage in drug delivery operations and in the study of kinetics. Their luminescence favors usage in bioimaging, therapeutics and sensing applications. Their distinctive electrocatalytic behavior encourages investigation on metal free electrocatalysis [22,23]. Usually the occurrence of carboxyl entities over the surface renders carbon quantum dots highly soluble in water; moreover, their properties are highly tunable by functionalization and surface passivation. CQD/GQDs with properties of rapid electron transfer and high surface area render them promising for electrochemical systems. Besides, the existence of rich heteroatom-containing (oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, etc.) functional groups on 0D carbon nanomaterials offer a plethora of active sites for enhanced electrochemical performance. Thus, they can potentially replace the commercially available noble metal-based catalysts for hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions [24].\nRecently, several reports highlighted the potential of CQD/GQDs for application in supercapacitors [25–28], LIBs [29], SIBs [30], metal-air batteries and fuel cells [31–34], biofuel cells [35], electrocatalytic water splitting [36–40], CO2 electro-reduction [41] and electrochemical biosensors [42–47] with improved performance via facile techniques and low costs. Despite a number of reports on their fluorescence, the synthesis of CQD/GQDs [48,49] and their promising applications in photocatalysis [50,51], sensing [52,53], bioimaging and biomedicine [22,54–56], optoelectronics (light emitting diodes or LEDs, photodetectors and solar cells) [23,56], there is lack of focused reviews on the influence of 0-D carbon materials on the electrochemical characteristics of CQD/GQD-based composites. Here, we provide an overview on the latest achievements with CQD/GQDs and their composites for electrochemical applications with an emphasis on energy storage and electrocatalysis (Fig. 1). This review is designed to offer insights into the function of CQD/GQDs in electrochemical systems aside from their intriguing and exotic attributes."

      "text" : "The diverse range of properties of carbon dots support their use in biosensing, catalysis, bioimaging, optronics, drug delivery and supercapacitance. The optical properties of CQDs are noteworthy due to the π-π* transition of carbon double bond which enable the optical absorption in the UV range, 260–320 nm and through to the visible range and beyond [57]. Though the photoluminescence of CQDs has been extensively explored, the exact mechanism underpinning it remains unclear. Both excitation wavelength dependent and independent emissions have been observed. For example, excitation independent\nGQDs with 14% quantum yield were synthesized using oxidation of perchloric acid. Instead of defects which usually contribute towards emission, functional groups attached to the carbon framework led to the emission and quantum yield in this case [58].\nRecent research shows that carbon dots with excitation dependent emission can be obtained from biomass and can serve as supercapacitors in composites formed by reduced graphene oxide [59]. CQDs of variable dimensions and color emissions have been synthesized with usual blue and green light through to NIR and full color tunable emissions. The factors which impart luminescence to CQDs are quantum confinement, presence of oxygen groups, edge effects, emissive traps and excitons of carbon [60]. For instance, the excitation independent full color light emitting CQDs (Fig. 2) synthesized using urea and p-phenylenediamine exhibited red emission with peaks from 440 to 625 nm. This occurred due to increased integration of oxygen moieties on the surface structures which led to the reduction in their band gap, thus implying that the surface groups control the energy bands for these QDs [61].\nStudies show that key physical and optical properties of CQDs can be improved by surface passivation [62] and chemical modification which can lead to red-shift in the absorbance of CQDs [63]. Various methods employable to enhance the PL intensity and fluorescence properties of the CQDs, namely, PEGylation, synthesis route and surface passivation. Quantum dots synthesized with nitrogenous precursor with PEGylation showed enhanced quantum yield and photoluminescence in comparison with quantum dots formed by carbon precursor alone [64]. Along with the usual down-converted photoluminescence, upconverted photoluminescence has also been observed with CQDs. Upconverted PL refers to the mechanism of a multiphoton active process, where excitation at higher wavelengths (IR or NIR) achieves emissions at shorter wavelengths [52]. Note that the electrical, magnetic and mechanical properties are available elsewhere [52,55]."

      "text" : "The interactions between the carbogenic core and functional groups regulate electron transfer properties of carbon quantum dots. This interplay can be further influenced by doped heteroatoms [22]. The availability of profuse edge sites and the occurrence of greater specific surface area of GQDs facilitates electron transfer. The size of GQDs influences entrapping single electrons between the surface coating and the GQD [65]. Specific catalytic characteristics can be imparted to GQDs via doping with heteroatoms such as B, S, N, etc. [66,67]. Functional groups bearing oxygen when present over edges lead to expression of catalytic attributes by GQDs, while on the contrary, oxygenated functional groups in base can weaken the transfer of electron because of dislocation of sp2 carbon [68,69].\nCarbon quantum dots excited by photons exhibit electron accepting or electron donating behavior, resulting from FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer). It has been observed that the photoluminescence of carbon quantum dots can be quenched by electron acceptor (2,4-dinitrotoluene, −0.9 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) or electron donor (N,N-diethylaniline, 0.88 V vs. NHE) [50]. Shen et al. [70] demonstrated the generation of increased photocurrent in graphene quantum dots which were surface passivated with polyethylene glycol. Both GQDs and GQD-PEG were spin coated on indium tin oxide and on subjecting to light, electron hole pairs were formed and separated in the GQD-PEG. Later the electrons were carried to the electrode. The three electrode system showed that GQDs passivated with PEG exhibited high density photocurrent in comparison with GQD alone. Moreover, under NIR laser they displayed photoelectric conversion. GQDs encourage electron transport, yield exciton separation and carrier transporting interfaces [71].\nCQDs have been mainly applied in photodynamic therapy [72], drug delivery, bioimaging [73], sensing, ion detection [74] and LEDs [75], but their unique electronic and optical properties present\npotential for electrocatalysis. It is often challenging to enable HER electrocatalysis, which can function efficiently under alkaline conditions. To overcome this, CQD-Ru nanoparticle hybrid electrocatalysts were synthesized which demonstrated exceptional catalytic behavior under alkaline conditions. These electrocatalysts necessitates overpotential of just 10mV to attain a current density of 10mA cm−2. Such properties are superior in comparison to the classical materials for HER and Pt-based catalysts [37]. Likewise, excellent electrocatalysts were synthesized by assembling GQDs on S-doped graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets. These metal free electrocatalysts also displayed enhanced ORR performance [67].\nTam et al. [66] synthesized metal free B-doped GQD electrocatalysts for ORR by a single step hydrothermal approach using glucose. Electrocatalytic activity of BGQDs and GQDs using CV in presence of 0.1 M potassium hydroxide with 0.4 to −10 V vs. saturated calomel electrode on 10mV.s-1 scan rate showed oxygen reduction peaks. The accelerated electrocatalytic activity of BGQDs showed positive shift in peaks with rise in peak currents in comparison with GQDs which displayed reduced peak at −0.39 V. Wang et al. [40] synthesized a hybrid electrocatalyst for batteries by making a composite of graphene hydrogel and embedding it with GQDs. Here, the hydrogel served as a conductive base to hold GQDs. The synergistic assembly in turn facilitated electron transfer and minimized GQD aggregation, thereby enhancing the ORR activity. GQDs encapsulated in a graphene matrix presented catalytically active sites with defects. The GQD/graphene hydrogel was assessed as the cathode in a zinc-air battery with atmospheric air served as fuel. Its efficacy as an ORR catalyst was shown with elevated voltage profiles on discharging the battery till 100mA cm−2.\nPt-based electrodes that are commercially available for ORR are effectively replaceable by N-doped CNTs and N-doped graphene [76]. Using a hydrothermal approach, N-doped GQDs with functional groups containing oxygen and assembled using graphene oxide were tested as metal-free ORR catalysts. The electrode conductivity was 40 S cm−1, and the cathodic peak was observed in an oxygen saturated KOH. It is also remarkable that in methanol containing electrolyte, the electrode displayed stable ORR. Further, the catalytic activity was intact after two days of cycling in oxygen saturated 0.1 M KOH solution without any decline in the current [77]. Similarly, at −0.3 V vs. SCE a reduction peak was observed in the oxygen-saturated solution while no peak was noticed in nitrogen-saturated electrolyte. ORR results showed enhanced catalytic activity and size dependence. As the size of QDs increased the density of cathodic current elevated, confirming superior catalytic potential of larger QDs [78].\nLi et al. [79] fabricated graphene quantum dots (< 6 nm) doped with sulfur along with reduced graphene oxide hybrids. Samples fabricated with various concentrations of sulfur showed elevated ORR catalytic activity in proportion with increase in sulfur concentration. Results demonstrated that the amount of thiophene regulates the transfer of electrons, confirming that modified thiophene content can control electrocatalytic activity. After 300 CV batches, stable current was noted in oxygen saturated KOH electrolytes,; hence, one can conclude that the performance of S-doped GQD with reduced graphene oxide is comparable with that of the commercial Pt catalyst. The results also displayed tolerance to methanol in the oxygen saturated electrolyte solution."

      "text" : "Porous carbon electrodes consist of numerous carbon nanopores which are either filled with ionic electrolytes or none at all (Fig. 3a) [80]. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and NMR spectra indicate that these pores are normally filled with a large number of ions at 0 V. When the supercapacitor is positively charged, the ionic charge arises within the micropores to balance the electronic charge applied on the electrode surface [81]. The detailed energy storage mechanism is shown in Fig. 3b. One possibility is to adsorb counter-ions from outside the pores while the co-ions (defined as ions with the same charge as the electrode) inside the pores remain unchanged, hence enhancing the net ionic charge while increasing the overall ion population. Alternatively, the counter-ion adsorption and co-ion expulsion occur simultaneously, referred to as ion exchange, which leads to an increase in the net ionic charge inside the pores, while maintaining the total packing density.\nThe third mechanism is associated with the desorption of co-ions, thus removing the excess counter-ions within the micropores while reducing the total packing density. In practice, the energy storage may involve a combination of both mechanisms.\nCQD/GQDs have been tested for energy storage including supercapacitors and lithium/sodium ion batteries [23,27,30,39]. CQDs/ GQDs with rich heteroatom-containing (e.g. oxygen/nitrogen) functional groups provide greater number of active sites for higher pseudocapacitance [27,59,82] as given below.\nRedox reactions in alkaline electrolyte:\n̶C ̶ OH + OH− ↔ ̶ C]O + H2O + e-\n̶C]O + OH− ↔ ̶ COOH + e-\n̶COOH + OH− ↔ ̶ COO + H2O + 2e-\n̶CH ̶ NH2 + 2OH− ↔ ̶ C]NH + H2O + e-\n̶C ̶ NH2 + 2OH− ↔ ̶ C ̶ NHOH + H2O + 2e-\nRedox reactions in acidic solution:\n̶C ̶ OH ↔ ̶ C]O + H+ + e-\n̶C]O + e− ↔ ̶ C ̶ O−\n̶COOH ↔ ̶ COO + H+ + e-\n̶C]NH + 2H+ + 2e− ↔ ̶ CH ̶ NH2 ̶C ̶ NHOH + 2H+ + 2e− ↔ ̶ C ̶ NH2 + H2O\nIn addition, the incorporation of CQDs is conducive to decreased charge transfer resistance of CQD-based composites because of the increased charge transfer process and increasing ionic diffusivity both in aqueous and organic electrolytes, leading to improved electrochemical behavior [29,59,83,84]."

      "text" : "CQD/GQDs have rapid electron transfer and high surface area, which render them suitable for energy conversion systems [31,37,85]. The presence of a large number of functional groups on the surface of CQDs/GQDs such as –COOH, –OH, –NH2, etc. provides ease of surface functionalization for the design and preparation of multicomponent electrocatalysts [86,87]. The intermolecular electron transfer promoted by the interactions between these components might enhance their electrocatalytic activities [37]. Moreover, CQD/GQDs with heteroatom\ndoping (N, S, P, etc.) may efficiently alter chemical and physical properties of the synthesized materials as well as offer active sites, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic performance [32,88]. The electrocatalytic pathways in alkaline and acidic media are noted below.\nORR mechanism in alkaline media [89]:\nO2 (g) + active sites → O2*\nO2* + H2O + e− → OH− + HOO*\nHOO* + e− → HOO− + active sites (Two-electron reaction)\nHOO* + OH− + e− → 2OH− + O* (Four-electron reaction)\n2OH− + O* + H2O + e− → 3OH− + HO* (Four-electron reaction)\nHO* + 3OH− + e− → 4HO− + active sites (Four-electron reaction)\nThe ORR could occur either in a 2-electron pathway with the generation of HOO− species or in a 4-electron reaction, which is more efficient. The rate-determining step is illustrated by the desorption rate of HO* and HOO* intermediates for the 4e− or 2e− reaction, respectively. Since the actual ORR kinetics are complex, the mechanism can be simplified as follows [90]:\nO2 + 2H2O +4e− → 4OH− (Four-electron reaction)\nO2 + H2O +2e− → HO2− + OH− (Two-electron reaction)\nH2O + HO2− + 2e− → 3OH−\nORR mechanism in acid media [90]:\nO2 + 4H+ +4e− → 2H2O (Four-electron reaction)\nO2 + 2H+ +2e− → H2O2 (Two-electron reaction)\nH2O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → 2H2O\nOER mechanism in alkaline media [1]:\nOH− + active sites ↔ HO* + e-\nHO* + OH− ↔ O* + H2O + e-\nO* + OH− ↔ HOO* + e-\nHOO* + OH− ↔ O2 + H2O + e− + active sites\nOER mechanism in acid media [91]:\nH2O + active sites ↔ HO* + H+ + e-\nHO* ↔ O* + H+ + e-\nO* + H2O ↔ HOO* + H+ + e-\nHOO* ↔ O2 + H+ + e− + active sites\nHER mechanism in alkaline media [1,38]:\nH2O + e− → H* + OH−\nH* + H* → H2 (Volmer–Tafel reaction)\nHER mechanism in acid media [92]:\nH+ + e− → H*\nH* + H* → H2 (Volmer–Tafel reaction)\nH+ + H* + e− → H2 (Volmer–Heyrovsky reaction)\nwhere O2*, HO*, O*, HOO* and H* indicate the corresponding adsorbed intermediate compounds.\nFig. 4 summarizes the overall ORR, OER and HER in energy conversion systems."

      "text" : "GQDs could serve as ideal material for supercapacitor electrodes\n[25]. A symmetric micro-supercapacitor was fabricated by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of GQDs on interdigital Au electrodes with a\nGQD layer thickness of 312 nm (Fig. 5a). The device showed ideal capacitive behavior with typical rectangular shapes for cyclic voltammetry (CV) with high scan rates of up to 1,000 V s−1 (Fig. 5c and d) and superior power response with a small relaxation time constant (τ0= 103.6 and 53.8 μs in 0.5M Na2SO4 and 2M 1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4)/acetonitrile electrolytes, respectively). This symmetrical supercapacitor delivered a specific capacitance of 534.7 μF cm−2, energy density of 0.074 μWh cm−2 and energy power of 7.5 μWcm−2 at the current density of 15 μA cm−2 in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution, while those values in the organic electrolyte (2M EMIMBF4/acetonitrile) were 468.1 μF cm−2, energy density of 0.474 μWh cm−2 and specific power of 56.7 μWcm−2, respectively. Additionally, the authors developed an asymmetric supercapacitor by adopting MnO2 nano-needles (5–10 nm in diameter, and 50 nm in length) as a positive electrode and GQDs as a negative electrode, which exhibited high specific capacitance of 1107.4 μF cm−2 at 15 μA cm−2 with specific energy density of 0.154 μWh cm−2 and specific power of 7.51 μWcm−2. The GQDs//MnO2 device also demonstrated good cycling stability with 93.3% capacitance retention over 5,000 CV cycles at a scan rate of 1 V s−1. The excellent electrochemical performance of GQD-based supercapacitors were ascribed to a small equivalent series resistance, fast charge transport and high conductivity of GQDs.\nIn a related application, the same group fabricated an asymmetric GQD/polyaniline (PANI) micro-supercapacitor with GQDs and PANI nanofibers as negatively and positively active materials, respectively [93]. Such a device showed areal capacitance of 667.5 μF cm−2 at a current density of 15.0 μA cm−2, which corresponded to energy and power densities of 0.093 μWh cm−2 and 7.52 μWcm−2, respectively, together with an excellent rate capability from 1 to 1000 V s−1, short relaxation time constant (τ0= 115.9 μs) and superior cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 97.3% over 1,500 CV cycles at 1 V s−1\nin 0.5M Na2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, the electrochemical properties of the GQDs//PANI device was investigated in H3PO4–PVA gel electrolyte, which delivered an areal capacitance of 210 μF cm−2 at 15.0 μA cm−2, corresponding to energy density of 0.029 μWh cm−2 and power density of 7.46 μWcm−2, and retained 85.6% its initial capacitance over 1,500 cycles at a scan rate of 1 V s−1.\nThere are several reports on the use of GQD/CQDs-based composites with enhanced capacitance. For example, the CQD/RuO2 composite was synthesized via a simple impregnation method and used as an active material for supercapacitor electrode [28]. The hybrid with 41.9wt % Ru loading exhibited highest capacitive activity with a specific capacitance of 594 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 1MH2SO4, which still retained 77.4% at a current density of 50 A g−1, indicating its ultrahigh rate capability. Moreover, the electrode illustrated improved cycling stability with retention of 96.9% and almost 100% of its Coulombic efficiency after 5,000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles at 5 A g−1 in comparison with 73.9% capacitance retention for pure RuO2 under the same conditions. The enhanced electrochemical characteristics of the hybrid was ascribed to the effective prevention of RuO2 agglomeration due to the efficient dispersion of CQDs and unique CQD-based hybrid network structure which enables fast charge transfer and ionic penetration during the redox reactions.\nThe use of biomass-derived N-doped CQDs from cauliflower leaf wastes has been reported for hydrothermal fabrication of hybrids with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) [59]. It was found that CQDs act as intercalators to preclude the aggregation/restacking of RGO sheets effectively, leading to large surface area (415m2 g−1) and pore volume\n(2.94 cm3 g−1). In addition, rich nitrogen functional groups on RGO/ CDs provided more active sites, contributing to higher pseudo-capacitance. As a result, the RGO/CDs hybrid revealed a maximum specific capacitance of 278 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 in 1MH2SO4 electrolyte and still maintained a high capacitance of 165 F g−1 at a high current density of 100 A g−1, corresponding to a capacitance retention of 59.5%, indicating its superior rate capability. The electrode material also showed long-term durability with 96.1% capacitance retention over 10,000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 20 A g−1. Later, RGO/CD composites were further deoxygenated by a facile reduction in hydriodic acid vapor to improve the electrical conductivity and introduce iodine heteroatoms (6.1wt%) in the structure [83]. The specific capacitance of I-doped graphene/CDs hybrid in an alkaline electrolyte (1M KOH) was measured as 374 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2mV s−1; the capacitance declined by only 28.3% to 268 F g−1 as the scan rate reached 1000mV s−1. The material also demonstrated superior cyclic durability with 93.8% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. The enhanced electrochemical performance of HI-treated RGO/CDs derived from the increased electrical conductivity and micro/mesoporous structure, which enabled ionic penetration from the electrolyte into the electrode, leading to higher ion diffusion coefficient of 22.13× 10−19 cm2 s−1 in comparison with 5.21× 10−19 cm2 s−1 for RGO/CDs. Moreover, the presence of iodine heteroatoms as neutral I2 (57.7 at.%) and I− anion (42.3 at.%) contributed to higher pseudo-capacitance via the following redox reactions [83]:\n̶I + 2OH− ↔ ̶ IO + H2O + 2e-\n̶IO + 4OH− ↔ ̶ IO3 + 2H2O + 4e-\n̶I + 3H2O ↔ ̶ IO3 + 6H+ + 6e-\nI2 + 2H2O ↔ 2IO− + 4H+ + 2e-\nIO− + 4OH− ↔ IO3− + 2H2O + 4e-\nI2 + 6H2O ↔ 2IO3− + 12H+ + 10e-\nIn another approach, Zhang et al. [94] explored GQDs to fabricate activated hierarchical porous carbon nanosheets (AHPCNs) as electrode material for supercapacitors. The AHPCNs demonstrated high values of specific capacitance of 230 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and delivered 170 F g−1 at 100 A g−1, indicating an excellent rate capability of the AHPCNs. Furthermore, the material exhibited excellent cycling stability with insignificant capacitance loss over 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1. The enhanced electrochemical performance of AHPCNs stemmed from large specific area (1450m2 g−1) with a micro/mesoporous structure which affords a large number of energy storage sites and ionic diffusion channels [15]. Table 1 summarizes the electrochemical performance of CQD/GQDbased supercapacitors reported in the literature."

The coating of GQD layer on CuO/Cu helped prevent the formation of thick solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on the active materials and lower the electrochemical impedance, hence facilitating the transport kinetics. As a result, the CuO/Cu/GQD electrode exhibited an initial discharge capacity of ~960 mAh g−1 with initial Coulombic efficiency of 87% and a high reversible specific capacitance of 780 mAh g−1 at 1/3 C (1 C=674mA g−1) over 500 cycles. After 70 charge/discharge cycles at current densities of 1/ 3 C–30 C, the current density was switched back to 1/3 C with specific capacity recovery of 85% compared to 70% of the CuO/Cu under the same conditions, indicating good reversibility of the CuO/Cu/GQD electrode.\nThe same group investigated the effect of GQD coating on the electrochemical performance of a less stable material (VO2) [30]. The\nVO2@GQD hierarchical structure grown on graphene foam (GF) skeleton was employed as binder-free electrodes in both LIBs and Na-ion batteries (NIBs). The GQD coated GF/VO2 showed an initial Li storage capacity of 421 mAh g−1 at 1/3 C (1 C=300mA g−1), which is higher than that of the uncoated electrode (391 mAh g−1) (Fig. 7a). Besides, the electrode still delivered discharge capacities of 198 and 151 mAh g−1 at 60 C and 120 C, respectively. After the measurements at high current rates, the GQD coated GF/VO2 recovered to 389 mAh g−1 at 1 C, which remained 97.7% of its original capacity, manifesting outstanding reversibility of the GQD coated GF/VO2 (Fig. 7b). Notably, the material also exhibited excellent endurability with a capacity retention of 94% and Coulombic efficiency of ~100% over 1,500 cycles at high C rate of 60 C (Fig. 7c). In addition, NIBs based on the same material had high sodium storage capacities of 306, 284, 265, 247, 201, 160, 127 and 93 mAh g−1 at 1/3 C, 1 C, 2 C, 5 C, 10 C, 30 C, 60 C and 120 C, respectively, together with capacity retentions of 91% and 88% over 500 and 1,500 cycles at 1/3 C and 60 C, respectively (Fig. 7d and e). The coating of GQD layer on VO2 not only improved the electrical conductivity of the oxide, but also protected the active material from aggregation/dissolution. Also, the incorporation of GQDs rendered the oxide surface lipophilic, facilitating the ionic/electrolyte diffusion for enhanced reaction kinetics. Finally, the nanocavities caused by stacked GQDs favored transportation pathways for Li+/Na+ ions and also contributed to higher capacities through physical adsorption between GQDs and Li+/Na+ ions."

      "text" : "GQDs and CQDs with edge enrichment have been reported to be\nadvantageous for oxygen reduction reactions. Especially, the heteroatoms (N, B, P, S etc.) in CQDs/GQDs due to their different electronegativity with sp2 carbon, polarizes the adjacent C atoms, facilitating the adsorption capacity of oxygen molecules and lowering the oxygen dissociative energy barrier [104,105]. A brief summary on the ORR performance of CQD/GQD-based electrocatalysts is presented in Table 2.\nLiu et al. [106] explored the ORR activity of CQDs after their surface was modified with phosphorus in 0.1 M O2-saturated KOH electrolyte.\nThe results showed that CQDs without PO4 modification displayed very poor ORR activity with onset potential of 0.782 V vs RHE while PO4–CQDs possessed an onset potential of 0.924 V vs RHE and a diffusion-limiting current density (jL) of ~3.8 mA cm−2, which were close to those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (1.0 V vs RHE and ~4.3mA cm−2) (Fig. 8a). The electron number transferred per oxygen molecule of PO4–CDs was estimated to be 3.8, indicating that the fourelectron reduction process is dominant. It was found that the weak electronegativity and negative charge of P atoms on PO4–CQDs altered the distribution of charge on C atoms adjacent to P, generating a number of active sites to enhance the interaction with O2 molecules, thus weakening the O–O bonding and attracting electrons to reduce O2. The electrocatalyst also demonstrated an excellent long-time stability with a minimal fading of 5.7% over 8 h under electrochemical stress (0.7 V vs RHE) compared to 16.9% of the benchmark Pt/C (Fig. 8c). Additionally, the ORR catalytic activity of PO4–CQDs was investigated in an acid medium (O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4), which exhibited an onset potential of 0.84 V vs RHE, 80mV more negative than that in 0.1 M O2-saturated KOH electrolyte, and lost approximately 10% of its activity over 8 h of continuous chronoamperometric measurements. The authors further improved the ORR performance by constructing PO4–terminated CQDs with Au nanoparticles under visible light. The PO4–CQD/Au electrode revealed increased current density, an onset potential of 0.998 V vs RHE, jL value of 5.0mA cm−2 and an electron transfer number of 4.0 under visible light (Fig. 8d). Notably, the calculated kinetic-limiting current density (jk) changed with the wavelength of the irradiated light source and reached a maximum value of ~19.8 mA cm−2 under green light (Fig. 8e). The enhanced electrochemical activity of PO4–CQDs/Au was ascribed to the synergistic effect\nof the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) property of Au nanoparticles and light-generated electron transfer feature of PO4–CQDs, and faster electron transport between Au and terminated CQDs.\nGQD/CQD-based materials have been fabricated for improved ORR electrocatalytic activities. For instance, anthracite coal-derived GQDs were assembled with graphene via a hydrothermal process to fabricate composite nanoplatelets, which were further B,N-codoped at high temperature using boric acid and NH3 as boron and nitrogen sources [34]. The hybrid demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity towards ORR with an onset potential 15mV of greater positivity than that of the benchmark Pt/C, an average electron transfer number of 3.93 and kinetic current (jk) of 11.1 mA cm2. Similarly, Jin et al. [33] synthesized GQDs on graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) via a one-step s reduction of both methylbenzene and bromobenzene in the presence of sodium metal. The resultant GQD/GNR composite with high specific area of 158m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.29 cm3 g−1 presented an O2 reduction peak at −0.19 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in O2 saturated 0.1M KOH, an average electron transfer number of 3.91, together with a more positive onset potential, higher jL value, better durability and resistance to CH3OH crossover than those of Pt/C. The superb ORR catalytic activity of GQD/GNRs came from the abundant edge/surface disorders/defects on their surfaces and the intimate contact between GNRs and GQDs, which simultaneously prevented the aggregation of GQDs and facilitated the charge transfer process efficiently.\nSong et al. [107] employed GQDs to stabilize platinum nanoparticles by a hydrothermal reaction. The size of Pt nanoparticles was controlled by changing the hydrothermal time and the reaction temperature between 140 and 200 °C. It was found that the Pt/GQD hybrid synthesized at 160 °C for 12 h exhibited the highest ORR\nelectrochemical activity in 0.1M HClO4 with an onset potential of 1.02 V vs RHE, a kinetic-limiting current density of 29.2 Am−2 and an electron transfer number of ~4.0. The composite mass activity catalyst was 468.1 A gPt−1, superior to any previously reported Pt-based materials (e.g., Pt/C 160 A gPt−1, PtPd 240 A gPt−1, PtAu 200–300 A gPt−1 and PtNi 300–360 A gPt−1, etc.). In another case, GQDs were first decorated on sulfur-doped gra-\nphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) by a hydrothermal treatment, followed by pyrolysis at 400 °C to improve the electrical conductivity [67]. The nanojunction structure of the resulting S-doped g-C3N4/GQDs with cross-linked nanosheets contained high N and S doping levels of 15.02 and 2.6 at.%, respectively. As a result, the prepared catalyst showed an obvious O2 reduction peak at −0.27 V (vs Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 10mV s−1 in O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves illustrated an onset potential of −0.07 V and a diffusion current of 3.2mA cm−2 at −0.8 V, which was close to the benchmark Pt/C (−0.01 V and 3.0mA cm−2). The electron number transferred per oxygen molecule of the hybrid was estimated to be 3.5 with the yield of HO2− production during the ORR in the range of 20–30%. The S-doped\ng-C3N4/GQDs indicated good stability over 8,000 s at −0.3 V and tolerance to methanol crossover.\nIn another approach, Zhang et al. [108] produced high quality Ndoped CQD/carbon nanosheets by a facile one-step hydrothermal treatment of monkey grass at 180 °C. The electrocatalyst demonstrated an O2 reduction peak at −0.21 V (vs Ag/AgCl), only 30mV more negative than that for Pt/C. The composite onset potential and diffusionlimiting current density were −0.08 V and ~4.3mA cm−2 (measured at −0.8V and 1,000 rpm), respectively, which were comparable to those of the commercial Pt/C. Also, the N-doped CQD/carbon nanosheets had n values between 3.80 and 4.08, indicating a four-electron pathway. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the doped N atoms possessed negative charge (ca. −2.70), whereas the adjacent C atoms are positively charged (+1.21), which was beneficial for enhancing the adsorption of oxygen molecules on the electrocatalyst, leading to higher ORR performance. In addition, among N species, pyrrolic nitrogen had the strongest dissociative energy of −3.02 eV while pyridinic nitrogen exhibited the highest energy for oxygen adsorption (−0.82 eV)."

      "text" : "The interest in using CQDs for enhancing the catalytic activity of\nnickel−iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) towards OER was spurred by Tang et al. [148]. NiFe-LDH with a flexible structure is relatively open and layered, which facilitated rapid penetration of reactants/products and fast electron transport efficiency; yet its low electric conductivity limited its potential commercialization. The CQDs were first prepared from graphite rod via one-pot electrochemical\netching technique in pure water at static potentials of 15–60 V for 120 h. The obtained high purity CQDs with an average diameter of 5 nm and a (002) graphitic lattice spacing of 0.321 nm were used to fabricate a complex with NiFe-LDH nanoplates (Fig. 9a). The resultant CQD/ NiFe-LDH hybrid displayed an excellent OER catalytic activity in 1M KOH with an overpotential of 235mV vs. RHE at 10mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope 35mV dec−1 (Fig. 9b). Also, a current density of 2.5 mA cm−2 was sustained at 1.46 V vs. RHE for 3,000 s,\na The electrolyte is 0.1M HClO4. b The electrolyte is 0.5MH2SO4. c The electrolyte is 0.5M KOH. d The electrolyte is 0.5M HClO4. e The electrolyte is 0.1M NaOH.\ndemonstrating good durability. The OER performance of the CQD/NiFeLDH complex is probably due to large surface area of CQDs and strong interaction between CQDs and NiFe-LDH phase with excellent conductivity and fast electron transfer process. Later, the same group used the CQDs to assemble CQDs/SnO2–Co3O4 heterostructure via one-step hydrothermal treatment [149], which exhibited efficient OER behavior in alkaline media. It was found that the Sn:Co molar ratio strongly affected the OER catalytic activity of the sample and the hybrid with a Sn:Co molar ratio of 1:3 showed the highest electrocatalytic activity\nwith onset potentials of 0.56 and 0.51 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and Tafel slopes of 62 and 60mV dec−1 in 0.1 and 1M KOH electrolytes, respectively. The CQDs/SnO2–Co3O4 electrocatalyst also displayed long term stability with low loss in relative current, maintained at 93.5% under 6 h of current-time (i-t) chronoamperometric measurements. The improved catalytic activity towards the OER of CQDs/SnO2–Co3O4 was attributed to its Co active centres, good electrical conductivity induced by nano-sized SnO2 and reduced hydroxylgroup-free CQDs, large surface area due to small CQDs, high electron transfer efficiency from CQDs to the surface of Co3O4 and insoluble CQD layer which efficiently inhibited the solubility of SnO2 into alkaline medium over time.\nIn 2016, Zhang et al. [129] reported a fabrication procedure for nitrogen-doped carbon nanodots by hydrothermal method at 180 °C for 15 h adopting shrimp shells as precursors. The obtained CQDs with a size in the range of 1.5–5.5 nm and abundant N content (14.42 at.%) were used as C and N sources to immobilize Co2+ by polymerization with support of pyrrole, followed by a pyrolysis at different temperatures ranging from 700 to 1000 °C to finally achieve Co/CoO nanoparticles on N-doped carbon materials. The results indicate that the pyrolysis temperature has a significant impact on the composition of the resulting composites, hence triggering changes in their catalytic activities towards OER. The Co/CoO/N-doped carbon microporous complex pyrolyzed at 800 °C with high surface area of 648m2 g−1 and a large total pore volume of 0.342 cm3 g−1 favors the exposure of active sites and mass transport of reactants and products during the OER process. Moreover, the synergistic effect of Co–N bonding in graphitic carbon substrate accounts for high OER electrocatalytic activity in 0.1 M KOH with an overpotential of 0.64 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a current density of 10mA cm−2, which increases by 0.08 V after 1,000 cycles, indicating the long-term stability of the electrocatalyst. In another case, shrimp-shell derived CQDs were utilized to synthesize a composite consisting of Co9S8 and N-doped porous carbon (Co9S8@NC) by moltensalt calcination technique, followed by another low-temperature phosphorization with NaH2PO2 to obtain Co9S8/N,P-doped porous carbon [150]. The authors claim that the high OER activity of the Co9S8@NC derives from Co9S8 and N doping whereas further P doping damages the porous structure of the catalysts, leading to a decline in their specific surface area values and hence decreasing OER performance. The micro/ meso-porous structure of Co9S8@NC with high surface area of 663m2 g−1 facilitates the mass transport of reactants and products, and the exposure of sufficient active sites, for the evolution of O2 with an onset potential of 1.53 V vs. RHE, an overpotential of 400mV to drive a current density of 10mA cm−2 in 1M KOH.\nIn a similar experiment, Zang et al. [125] anchored Fe/Fe2O3 nanoparticles on N-doped carbon by pyrolysis of shrimp shell-derived CQDs and FeCl3 at various temperatures between 800 and 1,100 °C. The\nFe/Fe2O3/N-doped carbon pyrolyzed at 1000 °C had a mesoporous structure with high surface area of 747m2 g−1 and total pore volume of 0.026 cm3 g−1. The Fe–N–C bonding was shown to be beneficial for the enhanced OER catalytic activity of the material. As a result, the Fe/ Fe2O3/N-doped carbon exhibited good OER performance in 0.1M KOH with an overpotential of 0.69 V vs. Ag/AgCl at 10mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope 77.5mV dec−1, which are comparable to those of benchmark RuO2 (0.59 V vs. Ag/AgCl at 10mA cm−2 and 72.2 mV dec−1, respectively).\nCobalt phosphide (CoP), a member of transition metal phosphides, is a potential electrocatalyst for OER, yet poor electronic conductivity of CoP has limited its applications in catalysis. The assembly of CQDs with CoP has been shown to be effective for fabricating efficient OER electrocatalysts [151]. The catalytic activity of CQD/CoP composite was investigated in 1M KOH by varying the amount of CQDs (2–10mg). The results indicate that at the optimal CQD mass of 6mg, the highest electrocatalytic activity was achieved with a 10mA cm−2 overpotential and Tafel slope of 400mV vs. RHE and 93mV dec−1, respectively. The stability of the CQD/CoP composite was evaluated by chronoamperometric response, which remained at 76% of its initial current after 10 h. It was found that CQDs with several functional groups on the surface easily interacted with CoP phase to form a composite, increasing the surface area and promoting the electron transfer rate of the electrocatalyst.\nRecently, Ingavale et al. [113] employed B,N,S tri-doped CQDs derived from boric acid and L-cysteine to prepare a hybrid with reduced graphene oxide and CoO via one-step pyrolysis at 800 °C in N2 atmosphere. The authors also studied the influence of Co percentage (4–25wt%) on the catalytic activity of the composite towards OER in 0.1 M KOH at a scan rate of 10mV s−1 and rotation speed of 1,600 rpm. The catalyst is found to be optimal for OER with 7wt% Co, which requires an onset potential and an overpotential to drive a current density at 10mA cm−2 of 1.58 and 0.51 V vs. RHE, respectively. Furthermore, a Tafel slope of 118mV dec−1 suggests high reaction kinetics of the electrode. The synergistic effect of CoO and heteroatoms (B, N and S) is responsible for the improved OER catalytic activity of the composite compared to CoO itself. Table 3 provides a summary of the OER catalytic activity of various CQD/GQD-based electrocatalysts."

      "text" : "The applications of carbon/graphene quantum dots for electro-\nchemical hydrogen evolution are summarized in Table 4. Guo et al. [157] synthesized nitrogen-doped GQDs with an average size of 5 nm\non graphite foam (GF) via a facile hydrothermal route; the composite was then used as an ultra-active free-standing electrode for HER in 0.5 MH2SO4 electrolyte. During the electrocatalytic reaction, the electrons were quickly transferred through the GF and accepted by the NGQDs whose edges and carbon defects served as active sites to generate H2. As a result, the N-GQD/GF electrode required an overpotential of 72mV vs. RHE to drive a current density of 10mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 84mV dec−1, which is smaller than that for GF and N-GQDs (237 and 104mV dec−1, respectively). The N-GQD/GF also demonstrated excellent stability with no catalytic deactivation after 1000 HER cycles.\nHighly crystalline N-doped CQDs with a diameter of 4.1 nm was first prepared by hydrothermal treatment of ginkgo leaves at 200 °C for 8 h [37]. The as-prepared CQDs were then loaded with Ru nanoparticles via pyrolysis. The Ru@CQDs (3.78wt% Ru), annealed at 480 °C, was found to possess the highest HER activity in an alkaline medium (1M KOH) with a Tafel slope 47mV dec−1 and an overpotential of 10mV at a current density of 10mA cm−2, which is superior to that of the benchmark Pt/C (Ƞ10= 20mV). In addition, the material had significant stability over 10,000 cycles with its overpotential increasing by 4mV only at 10mA cm−2 in 1M KOH electrolyte. The synergistic effect between ruthenium nanoparticles and CQDs promotes the charge transfer process between the electrocatalyst and the electrolyte, leading to reduced charge transfer resistance at the interface, and hence increasing its ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that Ru@CQDs had the lowest H2O dissociation energy of 1.94 eV, indicating an easier splitting of H and O atoms. The addition of CQDs polarizes Ru clusters, strengthening Ru–O interactions and promoting the splitting of water molecules. Meanwhile, the dissociated H atoms were captured via Ru–H bonding, leading to the release of H2.\nCQDs/GQDs have been reported to be able to enhance the HER activity of some transition-metal sulfides (e.g. CoS, CoS2, Co9S8, MoS2 and Ni3S2) [32,88,150,154,158,159]. For example, highly active HER electrocatalysts based on a three-dimensional (3D) mesoporous nanostructured hybrid of CoS and N,S co-doped CQDs were prepared by heattreatment [88]. The resultant N,S co-doped CQDs/CoS heterostructure exhibits a substantial improved HER activity over N,S co-doped CQDs and CoS alone in 0.5MH2SO4 with an onset potential and overpotential to reach 10mA cm−2 current density of 95 and 165mV, respectively, together with a small Tafel slope of 56mV dec−1 and excellent electrochemical stability over 1000 CV cycles at 100mV s−1. The enhanced HER performance of the hybrid could be assigned to a synergistic effect\nof CoS and N,S co-doped CQDs, where N,S co-doped CQDs hinders the agglomeration/dissolution of CoS in acidic media, higher surface area of the electrocatalyst, and faster charge transport efficiency via Co–S–C interactions. Similarly, Wang et al. [32] synthesized a HER electrocatalyst based on N,P co-doped CQDs and CoS2, which exhibits an onset potential and overpotential at 10mA cm−2 of −66 and 78mV, respectively. The hybrid also shows a small Tafel slope of 76mV dec−1 compared to that of CoS2 (134mV dec−1), and long-term durability over 1,000 CV cycles in 0.5MH2SO4 electrolyte. The improved catalytic activity of N,P co-doped CQDs and CoS2 derives from greater amounts of active sites and defects caused by N and P doping into CQDs, which favors the adsorption/desorption of H*, and faster charge transfer efficiency due to reduced charge transfer resistance via Co–O–C bonding. In another case, Liu et al. [150] utilized shrimp-shell derived CQDs to synthesize a composite consisting of Co9S8 and N,P-doped porous carbon (Co9S8@NPC). The porous structure of Co9S8@NPC with high surface area of 278.6 m2 g−1 is beneficial for the mass transportation and the exposure of sufficient active sites, facilitating the formation of H2 with an overpotential of 261mV at 10mA cm−2 under an alkaline condition (1M KOH) and a Tafel slope of 101.8 mV dec−1.\nNot surprisingly, decoration of CQDs/GQDs on transition metal nitrides/phosphides with also works for fabrication of efficient HER electrocatalysts. By depositing a thin charge-polarized carbon layer derived from CQDs on Ni3N [38], the obtained composite heterostructure requires only 69mV to drive a current density of 10mA cm−2\nin 1M KOH electrolyte, which is even lower than that of Pt electrode (116mV) (Fig. 10a and b). The DFT calculations have shown that the H2O dissociation energy on the (110) facet of Ni3N declined remarkably by 0.67 eV when combining with CQDs (Fig. 10d and e). The C–C bonds in CQDs are polarized by ionic Ni3N surfaces, which act as catalytic active sites to dissociate water via C–H interaction, and hence enhancing HER behavior. In addition, the corrosion and passivation of Ni3N are hindered by carbon layer protection, leading to a remarkable stability of the electrocatalyst (Fig. 10c).\nThe introduction of CQDs inhibited the MoP nanoparticles from agglomeration and surface oxidation, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity for HER [160]. Due to small and uniform nanostructures, the CQD/MoP nanohybrid shows high HER activity in 1M KOH electrolyte with a low onset potential of −80mV and an overpotential of 210mV to drive a current density of 20mA cm−2. A small Tafel slope of 56mV dec−1 is close to that of the benchmark Pt/C (50mV dec−1), suggesting a fast reaction kinetics and Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for the HER on the surface of CQDs/MoP\nheterostructure. Wang et al. [161] reported the dynamic self-assembly of well-dis-\npersed GQDs and CoP nanoparticles on graphene sheets (Fig. 11A). The resultant CoP/GQDs/graphene hybrid nanostructure exhibits excellent HER activity in an acid solution (0.5MH2SO4) with an onset potential, Ƞ10 overpotential and Tafel slope being 7mV, 91.3 mV and 42.6mV dec−1, respectively (Fig. 11B,C). The durability of the electrocatalyst was evaluated over 2,000 CV cycles (10–170mV vs RHE at 100mV s−1) and 34 h chronoamperometric test at 91.3 mV overpotential with negligible loss in current density and nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency (Fig. 11D). The high electrocatalytic activity of CoP/GQD/graphene comes from greater active sites caused by well-dispersed, small CoP nanoparticles, high surface area of heterostructure facilitating both reactant/product diffusion and electron transport efficiency for fast reaction kinetics.\nRecently, GQDs were used to fabricate a composite with ternary nickel-cobalt phosphide (NiCo2P2) nanosheets as HER electrocatalyst in alkaline condition (1M KOH) [39]. The NiCo2P2/GQD electrode requires an overpotential of 119mV to drive a current density of 100 mAcm−2 with a Tafel slope of 62.3mV dec−1, superior than the commercial Pt/C (180mV and 62.8mV dec−1, respectively). It was found that GQDs not only promoted the growth of NiCo2P2 nanosheets, facilitating charge transfer process and providing channels for quick release of gas during the catalysis process but also generated defects at the interface between GQD and NiCo2P2, which work as active sites for dissociative adsorption of H2O."

      "text" : "Recently, the conversion of CO2 into valued chemicals has received much attention because of its enormous potential to control the emission of environmental CO2. Wu et al. [41] reported the use of N-doped GQDs as metal-free electrocatalysts for the electroreduction of CO2 in 1M KOH electrolyte. The results showed that the total Faradaic efficiency reached a maximum of 90% at −0.75 V vs RHE with ethylene being the main hydrocarbon product and accounting for 15% Faradaic efficiency. It was found that N-doped GQDs favored catalysing the formation of C–C bonding, which resulted in a predominance of C2 and C3 substances. The Tafel slope of N-doped GQDs was 198mV dec−1 compared to 371mV dec−1 of undoped-GQDs, which was derived from nitrogen doping with pyridinic N as leading active sites for the electroreduction of CO2. In addition, the N-doped GQDs generated oxygenates and hydrocarbons including CO, ethylene and ethanol at\nTable 4 HER performance of CQD/GQD-based electrocatalysts.\nReference Electrolyte Catalysts Onset potential (mV) vs RHE Ƞ10 (mV) Tafel slope (mV dec−1)\n[157] 0.5 MH2SO4 N-GQDs/Graphite foam 72 84 [157] 0.5 MH2SO4 N-GQDs 237 104 [37] 1M KOH Ru@CQDs 0 10 47 [88] 0.5 MH2SO4 N,S co-doped CQDs/CoS 95 165 56 [32] 0.5 MH2SO4 N,P co-doped CQDs/CoS2 −66 78 76 [150] 1M KOH Co9S8@NPC 150 261 101.8 [38] 1M KOH CQDs/Ni3N 69 108 [160] 1M KOH CQDs/MoP −80 Ƞ20= 210 56 [161] 0.5 MH2SO4 CoP/GQDs/graphene 7 91.3 42.6 [39] 1M KOH NiCo2P2/GQD Ƞ100= 119 62.3 [129] 0.1 M KOH Co/CoO/N-doped carbon Ƞ20= 440 [87] 1M KOH Ni/CQDs 146 98 [87] 1M KOH CQDs NA 206 [158] 0.5 MH2SO4 MoS2@GQDs 95 120 40 [162] 0.5 MH2SO4 GQDs/MoS2 140 200 43 [163] 0.5 MH2SO4 GQDs/Au 130 78 [154] 1M KOH Ni3S2/N-doped GQDs/Ni foam 125 218 89 [154] 1M KOH N-doped GQDs/Ni foam 160 ~265 96.8 [156] 1M KOH CQDs/graphene ~-80 194 80 [164] 1M KOH CQDs/MoP −80 Ƞ20= 210 56\nproduction rates of 4.2, 1.4 and 0.7mol h−1 m−2 at −0.86 V, corresponding to current densities of 23, 46 and 21mA cm−2, respectively, which were comparable to those of commercial Cu nanoparticles under similar conditions.\nBiofuel cells were also reported to benefit from CQDs. Wu et al. [35] immobilized laccase by CQDs on glassy carbon (GC) electrode by direct electron transfer method as biocathodes for oxygen reduction whereas methylene blue was polymerized in situ on CQDs-modified GC to oxidize dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), followed by the immobilization with a dehydrogenase multiplex consisting of alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase as bioanodes for methanol oxidation. The CH3OH/O2 biofuel cell displayed a high opencircuit voltage of 0.71 V in 0.1 M quiescent citrate buffer (pH 6.0, 20 mM NAD+ and 100mM CH3OH), a power density of 68.7 μWcm−2 measured at 0.34 V and a good cycling stability with a power density retention of 67.1% over one week of operation.\nIn addition to the aforementioned applications, CQDs/GQDs can also be used in electrochemical biosensors. For example, Zhang et al. [165] first encapsulated CQDs in Pt nanocrystals (2.25 nm in diameter) using dopamine as a bridging agent, followed by combination with Ndoped graphene. The resultant hybrid nanocomposite exhibits good catalytic activity towards electrochemical biosensing of DNA damage biomarker-8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine in the 0.013–109.78 μM linear\nrange with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.45 nM (S/N=3). In another case, the probe single-stranded DNA (ssDNA-1) immobilized on GQDs-modified pyrolytic graphite electrode showed the electron transfer with [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- electrochemical active species by electrostatic repulsion, leading to a drastic decline in the electrochemical signal [42]. Nevertheless, when the target ssDNA-2 or thrombin exists in the electrolyte, ssDNA-1 binds the target instead of GQDs, resulting in a rise in the peak current with the limit of ssDNA-2 or thrombin detection of 100 nM. GQDs were assembled on Au electrode by cysteamine cross-linkers, which was designed for the detection of hydrogen peroxide in the 0.002–8mM concentration with a LOD of 0.7 μM (S/N=3) [45]. Another electrochemical biosensor based on a glucose oxidase (GOx)/GQDs/carbon ceramic electrode was developed to detect glucose efficiently in the concentration range of 5-1,270 μM with sensitivity value of 0.085 μA μM−1 cm−2 and a LOD of 1.73 μMat S/N of 3 [46]. GQDs with excellent biocompatibility, large surface-tovolume ratio, porosity, hydrophobic carbon framework and abundant hydrophilic edges enhanced the absorption of enzyme on the surface of electrode, leading to high performance of the electrochemical biosensors."

      "text" : "New energy storage and conversion systems have been growing\nsteadily as promising methods for solving some of the outstanding challenges related to energy generation, on-demand supply, pollution remediation and advanced manufacturing with minimized cost and environmental footprints. Major challenges such as shortage of lithium (LIBs), slow reaction kinetics (SIBs), low energy density (electrochemical capacitors), sluggish ORR rate at cathodes, access scarcity and high cost of precious metal-based electrocatalysts seriously hinder their deployment. Thus, reduction in noble metal use without sacrificing its desirable electrocatalytic features by developing high performance electrode materials at low cost is an urgent global imperative. New types of carbon-based materials, zero-dimensional (0D), carbon (CQDs) and graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with their outstanding properties of rapid electron transfer and high surface area render them promising in energy conversion and electrochemical conversion.\nThe doping of heteroatoms (oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, etc.) in the structural network of 0D carbon-based nanomaterials offer enhanced active sites for improved electrochemical behavior. Our review describes recent work on the adoption of various CQD/GQDbased composites for energy storage (electrochemical capacitors, lithium/sodium ion batteries) and electro-catalysis sector (ORR, OER, HER, CO2 electroreduction, biofuel cells and electrochemical biosensors). The electrochemical performance of CQD/GQD-based materials and their mechanisms have attracted much attention. However, the roles of these 0D carbon nanomaterials in electrochemical systems are yet to be fully understood. The application of DFT is a promising strategy to address these obstacles.\nCQD/GQDs provide highly tunable photoluminescence with high\nquantum yield, yet these exceptional optical properties have not been used in energy storage and conversion systems. We aver that these intriguing CQD/GQDs could replace conventional fluorescent and brightener compounds (e.g., 2,2’-([1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-diyldi-2,1-ethenediyl)bis-benzenesulfonic acid disodium salt, fluorescent dyes, etc.) to fabricate smart fluorescent electrode materials for energy storage and electrocatalysis, for which the relationships between fluorescence and electrochemical performance need systematic investigations. Another hindrance with the wider use of 0D carbon-based nanomaterials in electrochemical systems is their sustainable mass production at low costs. Biomass based precursors have potential advantages for mass production of high quality CQDs with rich heteroatom-containing functional groups. The industrial scale-up of primary or secondary biomass derived CQDs can likely offer advantages for viable applications in energy storage and electrocatalysis through large-scale production of green, low-cost electrode materials in the future."

Their potential applications range from biomedical, drug delivery, environmental, photocatalytic to energy storage sectors. Among these, investigations have largely focused on their behavior in environmental sensing, biosensing, and optoelectronics, yet energy storage and conversion systems are progressing rapidly as new promising methods are emerging to solve some of the outstanding challenges with energy at low cost and environmental footprint. By virtue of their rapid electron transfer and high surface area, CQD/GQDs are desirable in these electrochemical applications. Further, functional groups with rich heteroatoms (oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, boron) on 0D carbon nanomaterials offer desirable active sites for enhanced electrochemical properties. Our review presents recent advances in the fabrication of CQD/GQD based composites for electrochemical systems, their mechanism of action, applications in energy storage (electrochemical capacitors, lithium/sodium ion batteries) and electrocatalysis (oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions, CO2 electroreduction, biofuel cells and electrochemical biosensors) with an analysis of their potential prospects.",
