Nowadays, it is playing an extraordinary role in the functional finishing of textiles and polymers. It has sought to improve existing material performances and develop fibers, composites, and novel finishing methods. Application of nanoparticles has imparted novel characteristics to textiles such as flame retardation, UV-blocking, water repellence, self-cleaning, and antimicrobial properties. This book on “Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles” presents diverse aspects of nanomaterial application in the textile industry, approaches used for synthesis and application, as well as strategies to remove toxic effluents from wastewaters employing state-of-the-art nanoadsorbents. We have no doubt that the readers will benefit from this book which covers latest developmental work pertaining to functionalization of textiles using diverse nanomaterials. We would also like to thank all the authors who contributed the chapters and provided their valuable ideas and knowledge in this book. We are also very thankful to the editorial board, and in particular to Martin Scrivener for the generous cooperation at every stage of the book production.\nShahid-ul-Islam B.S.

In recent years, fine materials that are produced using nanotechnology have been used in the textile production process. Production of functional textiles is the main purpose of using nanomaterials or nanocomponents on natural fibers such as cotton, wool, silk and synthetic fibers such as polyester, nylon, and acrylic, as they possess various properties such as light resistance, antimicrobial, self-cleaning, fire retardant, etc.\nDifferent kinds of nanostructures are used in textiles. For example, carbon and copper nanoparticles or polymeric nanostructures such as polypyrrol and polyaniline as electro conductive agents; aluminum, zinc oxides, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for increasing durability of fibers; antimicrobial agents such as silver, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide (TiO2); moisture absorbent agents such as TiO2; selfcleaning nanostructures such as CNT, TiO2, and fluoroacrylates; UV protection agents as TiO2 and ZnO; nano porous structures such as silicon dioxide or carbon black in order to improve dye ability of fibers; and many advanced properties such as heat conducting or insulating or electromagnetic shielding via introducing CNT or vanadium dioxide and indium tin oxide to fibers, respectively.\nIn this chapter, the development of using nanostructures to improve the properties of textiles is discussed. For this reason, nanostructures used in finishing processes are presented, separately.\nKeywords: Nanotechnology, functional finishing, antibacterial, anti-odor, deodorant, UV-protective, water repellent, self-cleaning, flame-retardant, wrinkle-resistance\n*Corresponding author: bashari@aut.ac.ir"

      "text" : "Textiles play a major role in the development and industrialization of countries. The increasing demand for modern functional textiles has led to the usage of new materials and technology. Therefore, high-tech materials and well thought-out fabric constructions can improve the wearing comfort and provide unique properties. Antimicrobial effects, UV-protection, flame retardancy, stain and water repellency features, and others are the most important requirements of textiles. Since textiles are now widely used in different application sectors such as clothing, pharmaceutical, medical, engineering, agricultural, and food industries, imparting these characteristics into textiles can increase their potential for different applications.\nNowadays, there is a new revolution in the textile industry with the apparition of new technologies, which could add special functions and prominent features to the fabrics. For example, there has been notable improvement in technologies for natural and synthetic textile finishing, smart fabrics, and high performance functional textiles. In this sense, nanomaterials play a vital role in technological evolution since they show interesting surface properties that allow increasing their effect in comparison with bulky traditional additives and materials. For instance, using conventional nanomaterials such as metal oxide agents, carbon-based materials, host-guest compounds, and so on are examples of nanostructured materials used in antimicrobial, deodorant, UV-protection, self-cleaning, and other common finishing methods. In addition, in view of the rising environmental awareness, using environment-friendly methods and materials is necessary in the finishing process. Therefore, using alternative materials with high environmental safety is preferred.\nThis chapter reviews the most relevant contributions of the use of nanoparticles for functionalize textile materials. In fact, in this section, the use of nanomaterials for providing new properties such as antibacterial activity, anti-odor properties, UV-protection, self-cleaning, crease resistance, and others is explained."

      "text" : "With increasing population in recent years, the bacterial infection problems are becoming more and more serious in comparison to the past. Many microorganisms live in human’s environment. The presence of these microorganisms on textiles can lead to unwanted consequences such as paling, staining, decrease in mechanical properties, and decaying of the textile. In\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 3\naddition, some environmental factors such as temperature and humidity and chemical materials that are used in textile finishing can provide an appropriate media for the microorganisms to grow and multiply [1].\nSome species of bacteria have a covering capsule, which surround them and keep them from drying out and other external factors. Each bacterium is enclosed by a rigid cell wall composed of peptidoglycan, a protein-sugar (polysaccharide) molecule. The wall gives the cell its shape and surrounds the cytoplasmic membrane, protecting it from the environment. The most important role of antibacterial agents is to penetrate in the cell wall and inhibit the bacteria’s living.\nThe best way to prevent growth and multiplication of bacteria is to destroy their appropriate conditions for living. Several factors provide an acceptable media for bacteria to live such as nutritional requirements, water, oxygen, and heat. These factors are easy to find in textiles due to their contact with the human body. That is why the human body can be a good place for the microorganisms to live and multiply [2].\nAntibacterial modification of textiles prevents the growth of bacteria, fungi, alga, and other microorganisms on them. One or more chemical agents that can destroy the microorganism’s structure are used in this process [3].\nAntibacterial materials are divided into two main groups called bacteriostatic and bactericide.\nBacteriostatic can link to the amino acids of the DNA in the bacterial structures and prevent the multiplication of the bacteria. On the other hand, bactericides can disrupt the routine metabolism of the bacteria and completely destroy them [4].\nA practical antibacterial agent must be easy to use in textile finishing methods, stable and durable in different treatments, compatible with other finishing materials, and non-toxic for end users and environment [3].\nThe antibacterial finishing of textiles has recently become a very active research field and has a great significance among the other methods of modification of textiles. Several metal nanoparticles have been suggested for antibacterial finishing of textiles such as silver, zinc, and titanium. There are also some biopolymers like chitosan, alginate, and starch that are used extensively in the textile industry.\nMetal nanoparticles are more effective in comparison to biopolymers due to their multi-targeted mechanism of action, high surface area-to-volume ratio, and unique properties of these nanoparticles.

One of the widely used techniques for coating textile substrates is the combination of the sol–gel synthetic procedure with the “paddry-cure” method [1, 6].\nSome of the nanostructures that can be used in antibacterial finishing of textiles are mentioned as follows."

Nanostructure-loaded carriers: In this method, several chemical materials such as nano spheres, nano/microcapsules, dendrimers, liposomes, and nano tubes can be used for loading of the antibacterial agent and delivering it to the surface of the fabric.\nSome of the mentioned nanostructures are explained briefly as follows."

The general scheme for the photocatalytic damage of microorganism cells by TiO2 photocatalytic properties involves several steps:\n1. The photo-excited TiO2 catalyst produces electron–hole pairs that migrate to the TiO2 surface.\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 5\n2. Photo-generated holes in TiO2 can react with adsorbed H2O or OH- at the catalyst/water interface to produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and the electrons can react with oxygen vacancies to form superoxide ions. 3. Finally, the various highly active oxygen species generated can oxidize organic compounds/cells adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, resulting in the death of the microorganisms [8].\nBy the combination of electron and electron hole with oxygen, carbon dioxide and water will form in an oxidation-reduction reaction (Figure 1.1).\nThrough this reaction, TiO2 nanoparticles can destroy the cell wall of the bacteria and provide an effective protection against them [9, 10]."

Since the cell wall of the bacteria contains amounts of sulfurcontaining proteins, silver nanoparticles can react with these groups and affect the bacteria performance [11, 12]. It was also reported that the released silver ions (particularly Ag+) from silver nanoparticles can interact with phosphorus moieties in DNA, leading to inactivation of DNA replication, or react with sulfur-containing proteins, resulting in the inhibition of enzyme functions [13]."

It can be due to the narrower band gap of Zn structures when doped with copper and better photocatalysis activity in this condition [16].\nIn another study, antibacterial behavior of suspensions of zinc oxide nanoparticles has been investigated against E. coli. It was deducted that the effects of particle size, concentration, and the use of dispersants are large on the antibacterial behavior. The results show that the ZnO nano fluids have bacteriostatic activity against E. coli. It was also deducted that the antibacterial activity increases with increasing nanoparticle concentration and with decreasing particle size, while it turned out that particle concentration is more important than particle size. SEM analyses of the bacteria before and after treatment with ZnO nano fluids show that the presence of ZnO nanoparticles damages the membrane wall of the bacteria.

In terms of chemical structures, unpleasant odors are divided into the following three main groups:\nFatty acids such as body odor, sweat odor, etc. Nitrogen compounds such as urine, the smell of fish, etc. Sulfur-containing compounds, such as excreta, etc.\nTherefore, deodorant technology has attracted worldwide attention in different fields of applications. Among the various approaches, physical methods (absorption of odors by activated carbon), chemical methods (turning the odor into a common smell), and using aromatic compounds have been proposed to eliminate unpleasant odors [20].

Among different types of CDs, β-CD has a wide range of applications in the textile industry due to its low cost, ease of production, and ease of attachment to surfaces. Also, the size of pores makes it suitable for trapping a range of odor molecules [24]. One of the natural properties of CD is stacking the molecules on top of each other that increases the probability of absorption of odorous compounds. On the other hand, when the scent molecules are absorbed by CDs, the conical structure provides the effective possibility of maintaining the odor molecules. However, CDs as anti-odor agents have some problems. Since different odor compounds have various sizes and shapes, small molecules pass easily through the pores but large molecules cannot enter the inner structure of CDs. Therefore, CDs just maintain specific odor molecules with certain size [25]. CDs have been extensively used for the absorption of various odors in different applications such as controlling the odors caused by chronic wounds. For example, CDs can be incorporated"

This technology has been already introduced as “Exuderm Odorshield” brand (Medline Industries Inc, Mundelein, IL, USA) [26].\nIn a research, Narayanan et al. introduced an efficient wound odor removal by β-cyclodextrin-functionalized poly (ε-caprolactone) nanofibers. According to the results, the PCL/β-CD nanocomposites, by virtue of having their β-CD cavities free and unthreaded by PCL, could potentially be an ideal substrate for removing wound odors through the formation of inclusion compounds with odorants [27]. In the same study, Lipman et al. developed a new series of hydrocolloid adhesives based on CDs to provide an alternative technology for the adsorption of chronic wound odors. Their results showed that CD materials provide a new method of controlling the malodor associated with various types of wounds [28].\n1.3.1.1.2 Activated Carbon Nanoparticles Activated carbon is one of the most widely investigated absorbents in various fields such as water treatment, food industry, medicine, and the environment. It is considered as the most effective method for deodorizing in textiles. The mechanism of odor absorption by activated carbon is physical entrapment and it is capable to trap small molecules of body odors due to the high porous structure. Then, in order to eliminate the trapped scent molecules from a textile, a scouring treatment is required. In addition, activated carbon has an incredibly large surface area per unit volume and good potential to absorb a large quantity of odor molecules.\nAnother  amazing  property of activated carbon nanoparticles is their ability to absorb a wide range of odor compounds with various sizes. According to the research by Dr. Don Thompson from North Carolina State University, there are different types of odor compounds in the shoes due to the foot sweat. So, the diversity of odor compounds produced by body sweat creates a serious requirement to use materials such as carbon nanoparticles [29]. In a patent, Quincy et al. invented a dual-element odor control in personal care products. Their products comprised two portions with a formulation of activated carbon and silver nanoparticles. The obtained layer is disposed in a personal care product selected from the group consisting of diapers, training pants, absorbent underpants, adult incontinence products, and feminine hygiene products [30].\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 11\n1.3.1.1.3 Bamboo Charcoal Nanoparticles Bamboo is an Asian plant that is found in diverse climates from cold mountains to tropical or subtropical regions. Bamboo is one of the most notable natural resources because it is a fast-growing plant and used for various applications such as preparation of cellulose nanofibers and enhancing properties of synthetic fibers such as polyester.\nBamboo charcoal is prepared by five years of pyrolysis process of bamboo at high temperatures of about 800–1200 °C (Figure 1.5) and obtained from two different resources:\nStems, leaves, and roots of the bamboo plant Bamboo wastes.\nTherefore, the bamboo charcoal nanoparticles act like a sponge, catching any odor inside its fine pores. These nanoparticles are considered as a good candidate for odor absorption of textiles and the environment [31, 32]. Organic bamboo charcoal is 100% safe to use in fabrics, which are directly in touch to our skin. Therefore, bamboo charcoal nanoparticles have already been widely used with great success in different applications such as beauty products, water filters, foods, and medicines.\nBamboo charcoal powder’s ultra-fine structure contains millions of tiny gaps, which allows 1 gram of bamboo charcoal powder to cover a surface area of 600 square meters. This super porous structure of bamboo charcoal powder absorbs bacteria, unwanted odor, and wicks away sweat up to 50% quicker than cotton. \nAccording to the literatures, bamboo charcoal can absorb formaldehyde, benzene, toluene, ammonia, and chloroform at a rate of 16–19.39%, 8.69– 10.08%, 5.65–8.42%, 22.73–30.65%, and 40.68%, respectively. Also, bamboo charcoal fiber effectively decomposes the microorganisms attached to its surface and in the air around it. Recently, Ettitude Company has introduced its new product, “Bacteria and Odor Control Bamboo Charcoal Bedding”. In this product, bamboo charcoal’s ultra-fine structure powder is added in the bamboo lyocell fabrication process to create the antimicrobial and anti-odor bedding fabric [33].

Milliken Company first developed this technology in 1865 as a housekeeping and cleanliness technology to control the unpleasant odor of carpets and furniture. This method was inspired by a dandelion structure as a polymer mass containing very small branches. When, a person wears such a textile with an odor-trapping technology, the small scent molecules released from the body are trapped by the dandelion structure. Following the odor-capturing process, the conventional scouring method is utilized to remove the odor compounds from the polymer. So, these kinds of textiles have reusability, which is the most important characteristic of dandelion-like polymers. However, short lifetime and absorption of a low range of odor compounds are the main drawbacks of these polymers [35].\n1.3.1.1.5 Activated alumina nanoparticles Activated alumina is prepared by de-hydroxylation of aluminum hydroxide. It is a highly porous material with a large surface area-to-volume ratio due to the many “tunnel like” pores. Activated alumina is used as an effective odor absorbent in a wide range of applications such as wastewater, antiodor textile, and others via trapping the odor molecules in their pores [36]. In some researches, activated alumina nanoparticles with their tunnel-like pores have been used as an effective absorbent for different applications.\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 13\nFor example, Jenkins et al. produced an absorbent composition with improved odor control suitable for use as an animal litter, comprising an absorbent material, activated alumina, and optional additives [37]. Furio et al. proposed an absorbent structure with odor-control material consisting of activated alumina, carbon, silica gel, zeolite, siliceous molecular sieve, and their mixtures for an adult incontinence garment, absorbent pad, or diaper [38].\n1.3.1.1.6 Nano Silica Gel Silica gel is a hard, granular, and porous substance made by precipitation from sodium silicate solutions treated with an acid. The main properties of nano silica gel such as porous structure and large specific surface area play a vital role in the odor absorption process [39]. However, nano silica gel is not commonly used as an odor absorbent in comparison with other odor absorption agents in different applications."

To prepare aromatherapeutic textiles, β-cyclodextrin is the first choice as the host molecule, because β-cyclodextrin molecules are capable of forming inclusion compounds with organic compounds that fit into their own cone-shaped hydrophobic cavities. As a result of the inclusion, the physicochemical properties of the compounds are changed; for example, the vapor pressure of the volatile substance is reduced and the stabilities against light and air are enhanced. The functional textile with the “guest–host” effect may be achieved by anchoring the inclusion compound. The sedative effects for emotion and the pharmaceutical effects of essential oils were shown by Wang et al.\nIn this research, β-cyclodextrins were resolute in a mixture of alcohol and distilled water (1:3). The solution was emulsified in a high-speed mixer at a speed of about 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The lavender–alcohol solution was added to the emulsified solution within 30 min, with the aid of stirring, while the temperature was maintained at 40 °C for 2 h. The inclusion compound was fixed onto cotton with a low temperature binder by a conventional pad-thermofixing method. As a result, the rate of fragrance release of inclusion compounds decreases with time [54].\nIf CD is used as a carrier for aromatic compounds, this carrier should be bound to fibers in order to enhance the washing fastness of fragrance textiles. Since CD is not able to bind directly to the textile substrate, the usage of CD derivates or a cross-linking agent is recommended [55]. β-cyclodextrin modified with monochlorotriazine was synthesized by Sricharussin et al. and applied on cotton fabric. The pad–dry–cure method at high temperature (150 °C) was the best fixation way for this CD derivate on cotton fabrics.

Due to the vibration and heat generation by EM radiation in the human’s body, DNA and RNA in cells may halt production, which will lead to abnormal chemical activity of cells and cell cancer [61].\nThe simplest and most effective way to prevent EM radiation hazards is to stay away from the radiation source. One of the primary methods used in protection from EM radiation is “shielding”.

Thus, EM shields function based on the above-mentioned two major EM mechanisms: reflection from a conducting surface and absorption in a conductive volume. An EM wave striking a metallic surface encounters both types of losses. Part of the wave is reflected, while the remainder is transmitted and attenuated as it passes through the media. The combined effect of these losses (reflection and absorption) determines the effectiveness of the shield [63].\nAbsorption in an EM shield transforms EM energy into thermal energy.

For example, it has been proved that the UV protection property of cotton fibers will decrease after desizing. It can be due to the removal of natural pigments and lignin of cotton fabric after desizing [83].\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 27"

      "text" : "Modification of textile and polymer surfaces by chemical agents and inorganic nanoparticles is significantly investigated. Inorganic nanoparticles such as TiO2, ZnO, SiO2, Cu2O, CuO, Al2O3, and reduced graphene oxide are more abundantly utilized owing to the thermal and chemical stability at high temperatures, permanent stability under UV rays, and non-toxicity compared to the organic ones [84–86].\nAmong the nano inorganic materials, nano TiO2 and ZnO have some important advantages such as low cost [87], white appearance, photo catalytic oxidation capability [88], self-cleaning and UV-blocking properties [89, 90], and absorption of a larger fraction of the solar spectrum [87, 91]. Modification of textile and polymer substances by metal oxide as UV protection agents can improve the absorbency percentage in the UV region. However, by modifying textile and polymers via increasing the total reflectance and absorbance, the amount of transferred UV light can be reduced. Therefore, the UV protection of modified textile and polymers will increase.\nThe mechanism of the UV absorption characteristic is certified to the electronic structure of nano metal oxide. Indeed, modification of textile and polymers by the metal oxide nanostructures can absorb UV radiation with the energy of hν that is equal to or surpasses their band gap energy (Eg). The Eg of nanostructures lies in the UV region of the solar range, and therefore has excessive potential to absorb UV rays due to a great specific surface area [81, 92]. In other words, by increasing the surface-areato-volume ratio of materials in nano scale, more absorption of UV rays can be enhanced [91]. For example, TiO2 in nano scale shows superior UV-protection properties than that of the pigment TiO2 in micro scale possessing its stronger UV absorption properties. Also, enormous weak scattering intensity visible for nano TiO2 showed slight effect on the matrix color. Moreover, nano TiO2 has higher UV-A and UV-B absorption capacity than most of the other metal oxides and it has the highest refractive index among metal oxides. Because of great specific surface area and high surface energy and activity, the TiO2 nanoparticles have good affinity to textiles and polymers. Alternatively, when nano-TiO2 is used as a UV protecting agent, the negative effect of blue shift on the absorption edge will decrease the absorption of UV-A close to visible light [92]. However, using TiO2, nanoparticles have proved superior UV protection property for textiles and polymers. Some researchers used bi-component metal oxide to improve UV protection of textile and polymers. Ibrahim et al. used Ag/ TiO2 nanoparticles on linen/cotton (50/50%) fabrics for antibacterial activity, UV-protection property, self-cleaning ability, and durability to washing"

      "text" : "process. They claimed that these nanoparticles increase the UV-blocking and or scattering capability of UV-rays by changing the fabric color from white to brownish [93]. In another research, Cu2O/ZnO nanoparticles were in situ synthesized to the cotton fabric surface in order to improve the UV protection property. The results revealed that the improving UV protection property is much more in the case of using Cu2O/ZnO nanoparticles than using ZnO and Cu2O nanoparticles alone on cotton fabric. They explained that ZnO nanoparticles have greater UV absorption and reflectance than Cu2O nanoparticles, which guards next-to-treated cotton fabric and both are capable to shield fibers together by in situ formation of a thin layer of particles on the surface of the fabric. Consequently, when ZnO and Cu2O nanoparticles were positioned on the cotton fabric together, more UV rays can be absorbed due to the narrower band gap of this bi-component and synergistic photo absorption activity can be obtained. By studying the effect of in situ parameters such as curing time on the UV protection property, the obtained results showed that by increasing the curing time, the UV protection property improved [94–97].\nThey revealed that the formation of Cu2O/ZnO caused by the conversion of the residual of metal hydroxides to metal oxides could be increased under long exposure to heat of the curing process. Consequently, in situ synthesis of Cu2O/ZnO nanoparticles on the cotton fabric showed a synergistic effect on the UV protection property [83]. Prasad et al. in situ synthesized ZnO nanoparticles by the spraying and dipping process in order to modify antibacterial and UV protection properties on treated cotton fabrics. They claimed that producing durable antibacterial and UV protection properties on cotton fabric is a result of negative charge of cellulosic chains under alkaline condition that provide abundant sites for the nucleation and formation of ZnO nanoparticles [98, 99].\nUV or even visible light radiation causes some negative effects on textiles and polymers such as photo shading of dyed fabric, reduction of mechanical properties, and flaking and photo yellowing in wool fabrics. Therefore, using inorganic nanostructures can postpone these effects on textile fabric. For example, wool textiles have the lowest photo stability compared to other types of fibers, such as cotton or synthetic fibers. Therefore, light irradiation can cause photo yellowing on wool fabrics [100, 101]. Inorganic metal oxide nanoparticles such as TiO2, ZnO, and Al2O3 delay of photo yellowing in wool textiles [102, 103]. It has been demonstrated that UV protection and flame retardancy properties on textile fabrics result in applying Mg–Al nano layered double hydroxide. In other words, Barik et al. claimed that good UV protection can be achieved together with both higher mechanical\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 29\nstrength and flame retardant property at higher stiffness due to release of bound water and metal oxide residue through igniting [104].\nA novel approach for making UV-protective textile is the use of nanofibers as a protective mat on fabric. Embedding of UV protective nanoparticles in the nanofibers can have a major synergistic effect on UV protection properties of a fibrous structure. Several studies have been carried on for the protection against UVR by nanofibers containing nanoparticles.\nLee has reported that an electrospun PU/ZnO thin layer significantly increases the UV blocking and this property enhances with increasing zinc oxide concentrations of the nanocomposite fiber web [105].\nDadvar et al. showed that the TiO2 nanofilm coated on the PAN nanofibrous mats has a considerable effect on its UV protection. They also showed that the UV protection factor (UPF) of the mats increases with decreasing nanofiber diameter [106].\nIn a recent research, Merati et al. produced ZnO and MWCNT nanoparticle-embedded electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibrous mats. The results showed that the UV protection properties of the PAN/ MWCNT composite nanofiber mats of 3 g/m2 were better than that of PAN/ZnO at nanoparticle concentrations of 2.5% and higher, while the PAN/ZnO mats of ≥5% ZnO nanoparticles provided enough UV protection properties. Consequently, the composite nanofiber mats with 5% and higher ZnO nanoparticles had enough UV protection properties to cover the requirements of the Australian/New Zealand standard [107].\nIn addition to metal nanoparticles, carbon nanostructures can also be used to create protection against ultraviolet radiation. For example, graphene as one of the carbon materials possesses high electrical/thermal conductivity, UV blocking, and hydrophobicity [108]. However, the use of graphene in textile application because of few polar groups and weak bonding force with fibers has been limited, but graphene oxide (GO), as a functionalized derivative of graphene with a large number of polar groups that can easily bind with fibers and disperse in water, is a good candidate as a textile finishing agent [109].\nCai et al. prepared UV protective cotton fabric via the functionalization of cotton by in situ thermal reduction of GO absorbed on cotton. Conventional dip and dry approach was utilized. Both transmittance values in UVA and UVB regions decreased visibly after the cotton fabrics were coated with GO nanosheets. Compared with untreated cotton (UPF: 14.9) and GO/cotton (UPF: 20.4), reduced-GO/cotton fabrics (UPF: 35.8) possessed higher UV blocking ability [110]."

      "text" : "A waterproof textile is one in which the pores, the open spaces between the yarns and fibers, are filled with substances that make integrated surface and very low air permeability. In simpler terms, water cannot pass through the waterproof fabrics; however, the surface of this type of fabric may get wet during raining.\nA water-repellent textile is one in which the surface tension of the fabric has been decreased via a hydrophobic compound. The pores are not filled in this finishing process, so this type of textile is permeable to air and water vapor. Water tends to form droplets on a water-repellent fabric. The tendency of textiles to resist wetting is revealed by measuring the contact angle between water and substrate.\nThe size of angle reveals the repellency of the textile. When the contact angle is less than 90 degrees, the fabric is wettable. When the angle is above 90 degrees, the fabric is repellent or non-wettable (Figure 1.12) [111]. Various hydrophobic compounds such as waxes, petroleum-like molecules, soaps of polyvalent metals containing long-chain hydrocarbons, and compounds with low surface tension like fluorocarbons are used in order to produce water-repellent fabrics. Surface tensions and contact angles of polymers, which are used in textile finishing, are mentioned in Table 1.3.\nIn addition to the chemical finishing, water repellency is created on the fabric due to the surface roughness. An uneven surface compared to a flat\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 31\nsurface with the same chemical structure usually shows a higher contact angle. The presence of roughness in micro/nano scale can lead to the super hydrophobic textiles with contact angle about 160 degrees.\nBoth surface-free energy and surface roughness are critical factors for wettability. As a natural sample with superhydrophobic performance, lotus leaves and insect wings are made up of micro/nano-scale structure. In many researches, nanoparticles were added to the surface of a substrate to change the surface tension or surface roughness by chemical and physical methods such as in situ synthesis, anodic oxidation, electrodeposition, chemical etching, plasma etching, laser treatment, electrospinning, chemical vapor deposition, sol–gel processing, spray-coating, etc. [113, 114]."

Several research groups investigated the hydrophobicity of polymers and textiles using plasmas containing fluorocompounds such as tetrafluromethane [117], hexafluoroethane [118], hexaflouropropane [119], etc. Small molecules such as CF4 or CF6 as plasma additives can form short polymer chains hanging on the treated fabric surface. So despite their good initial hydrophobicity (contact angle > 120 degrees), they do not have acceptable washing or dry-cleaning fastness [120].\nIn order to improve water repellency and anti-stain characteristic of PET textiles, De Vietro et al. used plasma enhanced-chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) with a large fluorinated molecule for depositing a 100 nm thick layer with F/C ratio higher than 1.4 on textile and obtained a water contact angle around 150 degrees and oil contact angle around 120 degrees. The obtained fabrics were wear resistant, particularly if they were modified at high value of input power [121].\nIn another research by the surface of polypropylene fabric, samples were treated with hexamethyle disiloxane (HMDSO) to produce inorganic protective layers to reduce wettability. All HMDSO plasma-treated fabrics showed a significant decrease in demand wettability (water uptake) and a significant increase in contact angle values [122].\nHegemann used plasma treatment as a method to produce strain-repellent polyester fabric. The plasma activation in a low-pressure RF discharge with Ar/O2 was found to support a subsequent wet chemical fluorocarbon impregnation of a densely woven PET fabric and a PET knit showing a multi-layer, open structure. The plasma process that first leads to a more wettable surface, thus enabled enhanced oil repellency at a reduced film thickness in the sub-micron range leaving the touch and the optic of textile fabrics unaffected [123].\nAcrylic fabrics were processed with an RF atmospheric pressure plasma generator and afterward a fluorocarbon finish was applied through a traditional pad-dry-cure method. Two gas mixtures were tested (helium and helium/oxygen) with different plasma treatment times. The aging of the finishing was simulated through repeated accelerated laundry cycles. The water and oil repellencies were measured through standard test methods. While the initial water and oil repellency did not change, the plasma treatment improved the durability of the finish after artificial aging. The results presented in this research confirmed the benefit of applying an atmospheric plasma treatment as a preparation step for standard water and oil repellency finishing of acrylic fabrics. Although the repellency\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 33\ngrade was not affected immediately after the chemical application, the improvement in durability has been shown at long-term usage. After artificially aging, plasma pre-treated fabrics decreased their performance more slowly than the untreated and this gap has been quantitatively demonstrated [124].\nThe atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique, similar to chemical vapor deposition (CVD), is a chemical process to deposit a thin layer or film by sequential use of a gas. Al2O3 and SiO2 coatings deposited on cellulosebased materials have been reported to function as gas and vapor barriers [125]. Cotton fibers were modified with ZnO to make them conductive [126]. In the ALD process, a metal organic precursor (e.g., bis (diethylamido) silane, trimethylaluminium, and diethyl zinc) and a reactant (e.g., water) are sequentially exposed to a surface desired to be modified, resulting in a complementary sequence of self-limiting reactions. ALD allows preparation of dense and pin-hole free inorganic films. ALD is expected to be a promising method to produce super-hydrophobic surfaces with topography control [127]."

Hydrolyzing PEG and doping with SiO2 nanoparticles on a hierarchical nanofiber structure in the PVDF/PEG and PVDF/PEG/SiO2 nanofiber were performed. The results showed that the fiber structure of the PVDF/PEG composite nanofiber doped with SiO2 nanoparticles after water scrubbing was composed of balls, which are formed by embedding the SiO2 nanoparticles in the polymer, similar to the “small thorn” on the “lotus hill” because of the embossment of SiO2 nanoparticles on the “ball” surface.

Despite the hydrophilic effect of cotton fabric because of massive hydroxyl groups on the surface of fibers, the contact angle of the treated fabric increased to 139.8 degrees.

Thus, the precise control of roughness is required to satisfy both hydrophobicity and transparency. We have recently succeeded in developing a new process to prepare transparent superhydrophobic boehmite (A1OOH) or silica (SiO2) films by using aluminum acetylacetonate (Al (C5H7O2)3, sublimation temperature 193 °C) as a sublimation material. Either the boehmite or the silica film is roughened by the sublimation of aluminum acetylacetonate after calcination. Then, transparent superhydrophobic films are obtained by subsequent coating of (fluoroalkyl)silane [143].\nThe self-cleaning properties of the textiles can be obtained via chemical and geometric modification of the surface. As a result, adhesion of dirt particles can be dramatically reduced and a real self-cleaning effect can be achieved. The effective surface contact area for dirt particles is extremely minimized by the surface structure and thus the adhesion will be very low.\nIn a rough surface, the adhesion energy of the particle to the solid surface is very low which is because of the roughness of the surface and small contact area. Consequently, dirt particles from a superhydrophobic surface are completely removed, in contrast to a smooth hydrophobic surface where the energy is higher allowing only for the relocation of particles.

The roughness of the surface of the textiles makes it possible to have a super hydrophobic fabric via creating nano scale roughness.\nScientist suggests two methods for obtaining super hydrophobic textiles:\nMaking roughness on the surface of the fabric using low surface energy materials Modification of a rough surface using low surface energy materials [151].\nThe important issue in the self-cleaning finishing of textiles is not only the creation of a super hydrophobic surface, but also maintaining the induced properties for a long time [152].\nIn order to fabricate the cotton fabric with super hydrophobicity, scientists suggest using chemicals such as metals, silanes, and some methods such as coating with gas and layer-by-layer finishing. Using some chemicals such as silver and zinc oxides can provide some other properties such as being antibacterial and conductive as well as super hydrophobicity.\nSome methods for the production of self-cleaning textiles are represented in Table 1.4."

In this situation, some of the oxygen molecules leave the surface and water molecules fill the empty positions. As a result, the surface is coated with a water coating, which can clean it continuously. This effect can remain on the surface of the textile until a couple of days after the sun exposure [142]. The synergic effect of using TiO2 via photocatalysis effect and super hydrophilicity makes it an appropriate material for using it in self-cleaning products.\nIn one of the studies, TiO2 nano particles and their derivatives were used to produce a transparent superhydrophobic surface. The results demonstrate that microstructure and surface roughness of the films were changed with increasing TiO2 concentration, which attributed the size difference of the starting materials. Also the contact angles of the different films are also increased and the contact angle of the film containing 2 wt % TiO2 was higher than 140 degrees [154].\nIn spite of numerous studies in the field of self-cleaning and super hydrophobic textiles, there are still some challenges relating to their short lifetime and fragile structures. Another problem is the tendency of these surfaces absorbing some types of dirt such as oily substances. Using some metal oxides such as titanium in comparison to superhydrophobic surfaces can provide a more durable and stable finishing on the textile fabric. Some\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 43\nother properties such as antibacterial, UV protective, and anti-odor surfaces can be obtained via using TiO2.\nIn several studies, fibers are usually changes to a rough surface with nanostructures, such as nanoparticles, which face the issues to strengthen the interfacial interaction between the nanostructures and the substrate for application-oriented superhydrophobic surfaces. Alternatively, surface roughness could also be created directly from the bulk materials at the surface, resulting in hierarchical structures monolithic with the bulk substrate. The main advantage of this method is that these roughening structures possess strong adherence and mechanical stability [155, 156].\nIn one of the studies, PET fibers were roughened through chemical etching at the surface and durable superhydrophobic textiles could be prepared by following diffusion of fluoroalkylsilane into the fibers. However, diffusion of hydrophobic alkylsilanes into fibers shows dependence on specific equipment and conditions. It has also been suggested that some fluorochemicals have potential risks to human health and the environment [157].\nIn another study, the combination of a photoactive agent such as TiO2 and a superhydrophobic agent such as SiO2 was used to obtain the photocatalytic self-cleaning property on fluorine-free superhydrophobic cotton fabrics. The cotton fabrics coated with TiO2–SiO2 composite particles exhibit superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 160.5 degrees [158]."

Therefore, numerous attempts have been made to improve the flameretardant properties of textiles for a variety of applications. \nNatural fibers especially cellulosic structures can ignite fast and may cause a fire. In order to improve self-extinguishing of these fibers, researchers developed flame-retardant agents for finishing of fabric. Indeed, flameretardant finishing improved the resistance of the fabric against igniting. Furthermore, the flame spread rate decreased as a result of using flameretardant finishing.\nAnother method was developing synthetic fibers to produce fire resistance types of regular fibers besides developing inherently flame- and ignition-resistant fibers created by aromatic structured polymeric chains such as aramids and the poly(meta-aramid) fiber Nomex (Du Pont).

In fact, halogen-based compounds are prone to cause incomplete combustion due to the mechanism of trapping free radicals and thus to generate a large amount of smoke [160]. Furthermore, some combustion products such as furans and dioxins cause some serious health effects and environmental risks. Therefore, researchers have developed halogen-free flame-retardant agents for fabric finishing. Flame-retardant agents, containing phosphorus, boron, nitrogen, silicon, and other nanostructures, have been investigated to develop the flame resistance of fabrics and polymers [161]. Among different halogen-free flame retardants, phosphorus-based agents show high flame-retardant properties. However, these compounds usually have low water resistance to cause significant reductions in insulation properties and appearance in high temperatures and high humidity [160]. Therefore, using non-halogen and non-phosphorous based flame retardant agents in different applications is preferred.\nThere are various nanostructured materials with fire-retardant features. In fact, nanostructures have been recently used to improve flame-retardant property of fibers by melt spinning polymer/nanoparticles or a combination of phosphorous material/nanoparticles through finishing treatments.\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 45\nIn this section, some flame-retardant nanomaterials used in textile finishing are described.\n1.9.1.1 Flame-Retardant Nanostructures 1.9.1.1.1 Nano Clay Clay exists naturally in the form of nanoscale platelets, stacked up to form particles about few microns. Most of the beneficial properties of clay as a filler material are only realized when the particles are dispersed and exfoliated to separate the individual nanoscale layers. So, exfoliated nano clays can exhibit excellent flame-retardant properties [162]. The most commonly used layered silicate in polymer nanocomposites is MMT, which has encouraged much improvement in the mechanical, thermal, flammability, and barrier properties of polymers owing to its high aspect ratio, large surface area, extraordinary modulus, and nano-scale dispersion [163].\nNano clay particles play a vital role in flame-retardant textile coating. However, the exact mechanism of the combustion inhibition caused by nanoclays is not yet known but it seems that when the polymer matrix is burned and gasified during combustion, the incorporated nanoclays accumulate at the surface and act as a barrier to oxygen diffusion. So, the burning process is slowed down. Also, the nano clays act as a barrier to flame propagation and promote the formation of chars but they have no effect on the after-flaming properties [164].\nAs mentioned earlier, nano clays containing polar functional groups such as OH, -NH- or NH2 will lead to nano dispersion in polar and hydrogen-bonded polymers, for example, polyamides 6 and 6.6 and polyvinyl and polyacrylic and can be used for flame retardancy of fiber and fabric back coating finishing. Although cotton fibers have desirable characteristics such as comfort, good mechanical properties, biodegradability, and excellent wearing properties, it has some disadvantages such as high flammability and hydrophilicity. These properties are the reason for the limitations of the application of natural textiles in some branches such as workwear garments [165]. So, flame-retardant finishing on cotton fibers in some applications is necessary.\nThere are many researches about using clay nanoparticles as a flame retardant. For example, in order to fabricate flame-retardant finishing with different add-on values on cotton fabrics, the organosilicon-functionalized cyclotriphosphazene N3P3 [NH (CH2)3Si (OC2H5)3]6) was synthesized and applied to the cotton fabrics through a pad-dry-cure process. The LOI value increased from 20.5 to 24.5 and excellent flame retardancy was found durable after 30 cycles of the washing process [166]. Uddin et al. used the"

It was found that the two types of clays used can enhance the flame retardancy of finished fabric and significant amount of char was obtainable with increasing clay concentration [167]. Keshin et al. used nanoclay on 100% greige and bleached pure conventional cotton fabrics by finishing process. They showed that by utilizing nanoclay with a proper application process, it is possible to impart flame-retardant characteristics to conventional cotton fabric samples [168]. A cotton/MMT nanocomposite was prepared by Delhom et al. by the addition of pretreated nano clay and cotton to 4-methylmorpholine-N-oxide as a cotton solvent. The nanocomposites composed of higher than 7 wt% nano clay showed char yield about 30 wt% [163].\nThe improvement of flame-retardant properties in polyamide/nano clay textile nanocomposites was also reported in the literature. Wu et al. proposed flame-retardant polyamide 6/nano clay/intumescent nanocomposite fibers through the electrospinning method. Based on the transmission electron microscopy results, there was good dispersion and exfoliation of nano clay platelets within individual nanofibers. The degradation temperature of nanocomposite samples was lower than pristine nylon 6 samples. Moreover, the difference in residual char weight after decomposition was significant [169].\n1.9.1.1.2 Layered Double Hydroxide Layered double hydroxide (LDH) known as brucite-like compound is anextensive class of anionic clays with divalent and trivalent metallic cations andanions. Since the range of metals and anions which can be usedin the  LDH structure is quite extensive, the LDH properties are controllable [163].\nIn Pan et al.’s research, a layer-by-layer flame-retardant coating, assembled from MgAl-layered double hydroxides (MgAl-LDH) and alginate, was fabricated onto the surface of cotton fabric for reducing its flammability. The high flame-retardant ability of coated cotton fabrics is attributed to the fact that the MgAl-LDH-filled coating can form an inorganic protective layer, which can act as a barrier to heat and oxygen [170]. Also, Barik et al. applied the nano-MgAl-layered double hydroxide on the cotton fabric for enhancing flame retardancy, mechanical, and UV protection properties. It was found that the limiting oxygen index increased from 16.5 to 20.8 [104].\n1.9.1.1.3 Nano Silica (SiO2) Silica nanoparticles are considered as a potential flame-retardant agent to improve flame-retardant properties of textile fabrics. Nano silica is an\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 47\nenvironment-friendly material compared to other nanomaterials. Also, they are cheap and their chemical behavior could be easily controlled by surface modification [171]. These materials are commonly used as a fire retardant agent in different researches.\nGashti et al. prepared the cellulose fibers using a polycarboxylic acid/ hydrophobic silica nanocomposite coating with water-repellent and flame-retardant properties. The results indicated that the embedded silica nanoparticles modify the surface of fibers, increasing the thermal stability of substrate. This enhancement of thermal properties is attributed to the presence of the silica nanoparticles, which have high heat resistance, heat insulation effect, and mass transport barrier toward cotton molecular chains [172]. Also, Carosio et al. introduced a novel method to improve flame-retardant properties of textile fabric using multilayered thin films. In this work, PET fabrics were coated with silica nanoparticles using the layer-by-layer assembly method. Five bilayers of positively and negatively charged colloidal silica nanoparticles increased time to ignition and decreased heat release rate peak of PET fabric by 45% and 20%, respectively. This study demonstrates the ability to impart flame-retardant behavior using a water-based, environment-friendly protective coating [173].\n1.9.1.1.4 Carbon Nanotubes Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have also been investigated as a potential flameretardant filler material. They can reduce heat release in burning materials very effectively. Despite the relative high cost of manufacture for CNTs, the high performance of CNT-based flame retardants and the low concentration required could make them useful for various applications.\nIt is reported that combining a low concentration of multi-wall CNTs with the nanoclay filler produces a synergistic effect that is much more effective than either component alone.\nIn a recent study, CNT was stabilized on a cotton fabric using a vinyl phosphonic acid monomer as a crosslinking agent and benzophenone as a catalyst through UV irradiation. The results showed that the polyvinylphosphonic/CNT nanocomposite improved the thermal stability and decreased the flammability of the substrate [174]. In a research performed by Yin et al., polyamide 6 (PA6) was melt-blended with an intumescent flame retardant (FR), multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), and nano clay particles to produce multi-component FR-PA6 nanocomposites. The formulation combining both MWNT and clay showed the largest quantity of char residue and a synergistic effect in flame-retardant properties [175].

According to their results, TRGO and MLG250 indicated higher flame retardation in the nanocomposites, which can be attributed to the well-exfoliated graphenes compared to the less exfoliated, micro-sized, expanded graphite or conventional spherical and tubular carbon nanoparticles [176].\n1.9.1.1.5 Metal-based Nanoparticles Metal-based nanoparticles are used in textile finishing in order to improve their flame retardation. Various mechanisms have been suggested about flame-retardant properties of metallic nanoparticles. Metallic nanoparticles can act as a barrier to heat and mass transfer, restrict the mobility of the polymer chains, absorb active species such as free radicals, and modify the degradation pathway of the polymer. Following, we present some reports of the metal-based nanoparticle application [163].\nEl-shafei et al. performed the flame-retardant and antibacterial finishing on cellulose fabrics using TiO2 nanoparticles and chitosan phosphate. TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by the sol–gel method using titanium tetraisopropoxide. The obtained results indicated that cotton fabric gained flame retardancy and antibacterial properties [177]. Also in a same study, Lessan et al. proposed a novel flame-retardant woven cotton fabric using sodium hypophosphite (SHP), maleic acid (MA), triethanol amine (TEA), and nano TiO2 through the pad-dry-cure method [178]. In another research based on using TiO2, Hashemikia and Montazer immobilized TiO2 nanoparticles on the surface of cotton/polyester-knitted fabrics using citric acid as a cross-linking agent and SHP as a catalyst to produce a multi-functional textile with durable flame retardation, anti-pilling, hydrophilicity, selfcleaning, antibacterial, and UV protection properties. The presence of TiO2 nanoparticles and SHP as a phosphor source increased the char residue of the fabrics by 21% [179]. It is reported in Lam et al.’s research that nano titanium dioxide was used as a co-catalyst in the flame-retardant formulation of N-methylol dimethyl-phosphonopropionamide, melamine resin, and phosphoric acid for cotton fabrics to improve the treatment effectiveness and minimize the side effects. It was found that the nano-TiO2 cocatalyst had a significant effect on decreasing the flame-spread rate [180].\nIn a same study, Lam et al. used zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles as a co-catalyst for flame-retardant finishing on cotton fabrics. Their results showed that the flame ignited on the treated fabrics extinguished right after the removal of ignition source and by using 0.2% and 0.4% of nanoZnO as a co-catalyst, the flame spread rate of samples decreased [181].\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 49\nAlso, Samanta et al. applied nano-ZnO on bleached jute fabric to impart a fire-retardant finish. Nano zinc oxide was prepared from aqueous Zinc acetate by the co-precipitation method in the presence of NaOH followed by calcination at 600 °C. Then, it was applied on the jute fabric by the paddry method. The coating had reasonably good LOI values for as many as five wash cycles [182].\nIn another study, the LbL coating has been used to obtain the flameretardant cotton fabric by using Bio-based and phosphorus-free coating. Indeed, the flame-retardant cotton fabric was prepared by negatively charged alginate and positively charged polyethylenimine together with subsequent crosslinking of barium, nickel, and cobalt ions. Metal ions such as Cu2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Ba2+ were practically used as crosslinking agents for alginate to introduce the flame-retardant properties on fabric and films. The char residues at 700 °C revealed that the added extras of barium, nickel, and cobalt metal ions enhanced thermal degradation of fabric to fabricate firm char residues and reduced the degradation rate of the matrix. Moreover, the char residue showed a superior washing durability of the LbL cotton fabric when treated by the metal ions as crosslinking agents than untreated metal ions of the LbL cotton fabric. In other words, the flame spread rate of the LbL cotton fabric treated by barium ions demonstrated 28% reduction than untreated cotton [183].\nThe in situ synthesis of silver and diphosphate malonate nanocomposites was used for antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus bacteria and flame-retardancy properties on cotton blend and polyester fabrics. Indeed, silver nitrate was reduced to silver nanoparticles by a reducing agent and in the presence of diphosphate malonate, which acted as a capping agent. The results showed that by increasing diphosphate malonate in the nanocomposite, the size of silver nanoparticles will increase due to the reduction properties of diphosphate malonate. Moreover, comparing the effect of diphosphate malonate and silver nanoparticles on the flame retardancy property of treated textile fabrics, by increasing the diphosphate malonate concentration in the nanocomposite, more relative flame- retardant activity was resulted than increasing the silver nanoparticle concentration in the nanocomposite. The flame-retardancy properties of textile were considerably enhanced and char layer was solid enough by increasing the diphosphate malonate concentration in the nanocomposite. Indeed, the concentration ratio between the organic phosphate and silver nanoparticles showed a vital role in the nanocomposite effect on textile fabrics. The efficient effect of diphosphate malonate on the flame-retardant property leaded to the formation of a solid char layer upon the release of phosphoric acid which catalyzed degradation of cotton fabric, following char [184]."

      "text" : "Cellulose fibers are the most commonly used natural fibers in the textile industry. However, one of the major disadvantages of using cellulose fiber is low dimensional stability and wrinkle resistance. Cellulose fibers such as cotton have a high water absorbency and potential to make hydrogen bonds to water molecules. Therefore, water molecules penetrate into amorphous regions of cellulose and cause local swelling of the fibers. Subsequently, the cellulose chains displace from their original positions and hydrogen bonds re-form at new locations. As a result, fabrics become wrinkled in appearance [185]. In fact, there are two theories for the mechanism of antiwrinkle finishing of cotton fabrics.\nIn the deposition theory, small particles of finishing agents are dispersed in the amorphous region of the fibers and form hydrogen bonds with the fiber molecules. This may restrict the movement of the molecular chains and decrease deformation of the fabrics. In the cross-linking theory, the finishing agents form covalent bonds with fiber molecules, and join the adjacent molecular chains within the fibers. This gives the recoverability improvement of the deformed fibers and increases the crease resistance [186].\nAccording to the researches, wool and silk fabrics have good ability to resist the formation of wrinkles. However, some studies have been recorded about wrinkle-free finishing on silk fabrics. Generally, there are two different physical and chemical methods in order to apply anti-wrinkle finishing on fabrics that are shown in Figure 1.16. Physical wrinkle-reduction techniques, such as heat and pressure, are effective ways of flattening fabrics. However, their effect is not permanent and wrinkles reappear due\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 51\nto a range of shear, torsion, and compressive deformation forces applied in wear. Therefore, physical methods just reduce the wrinkle formation and do not have enough potential to improve crease resistance. However, the body’s heat and humidity can relax the fabric and enhance the wrinkling of these deformational forces [187, 188].\nFormaldehyde-based resins such as phenol formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde, melamine formaldehyde, and cross-linking agents such as glutaraldehyde and poly-carboxylic acid cause a significant increase in the crease-resistance properties of the textile. However, formaldehyde-based resins come with potentially dangerous side-effects and it is the main obstacle for efficient application of these types of materials [189]. Recently, using various nano materials in order to enhance the wrinkle resistance textiles has increased. In this section, different nano materials as antiwrinkle agents have been studied."

However, high cost, producing shade changes, and serious environmental problems are the main drawbacks of using SHP. Recently using various co-catalysts such as titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2) have been investigated in order to enhance the crease recovery finishing process. In fact, nano-TiO2 as a co-catalyst improves the finishing performance and decreases the side effects. In addition, nano-TiO2 is very stable toward high temperature and pressure. Due to its large surface area, nano-TiO2 provides sufficient number of active sites for the achievement of acceptable reaction rates [191]. On the other hand, nano TiO2 can fill the amorphous region of the cellulose, and hence, the presence of nano TiO2 inside the fiber would probably restrict the molecular movement of cellulose [192].\nRecent studies have discussed the application of nano-sized TiO2 in textile finishing such as wrinkle-freeness applications. For example, Lam et al. evaluated the wrinkle-resistant property of cotton specimens treated by butane tetra-carboxylic acid (BTCA) and catalyzed by SHP in the presence of nano-TiO2. It was found that the addition of nano-TiO2 could further enhance the wrinkle resistance of BTCA/SHP-treated cotton fabrics [191]. In a same study, Yuen et al. used nano-TiO2 as a co-catalyst for improving wrinkle-resistance of cotton fabric in the presence of BTCA and SHP and the obtained results were successful in crease resistance [193]. Hezavehi et al. evaluated the wrinkle-resistant properties of cotton fabrics dyed by\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 53\nDirect Blue 2B in the presence and absence of TiO2 nanoparticles. Also, the addition of BTCA can significantly enhance the crease resistance of fabrics, especially in the presence of SHP and nano-TiO2 as a co-catalyst. In fact, TiO2 nanoparticles restrict the molecular movement of cellulose chains, and leading to the enhancement of crease resistance of the samples. However, it seems that adding TiO2 in the absence of BTCA causes better wrinkle-resistant property, but is not considerable [186]. Also, Karthik et al. performed the non-formaldehyde wrinkle-resistant finishing of cotton fabrics using citric acid as a cross-linking agent and SHP as a catalyst together with nano-TiO2 as a co-catalyst compound. Based on the results, it was concluded that 10% CA, 10% SHP, and 0.1% nano-TiO2 were the optimum concentrations required to enhance wrinkle-resistant properties without any negative effect on the other physical features of the treated cotton fabrics [194]. Nazari et al. optimized the resistance of bleached cotton fabric against creasing by using nano-TiO2, sodium hypophosphite, and two different poly-carboxylic acids. Figure 1.18 represents the formation of linkages between BCTA/cellulose chains and BCTA/nano-TiO2. The presence of nano-TiO2 enhances the cross-linking between cellulose chain and cross linker.

Also, in a research performed by Farouk et al., ZnO nanoparticles-chitosan composite was prepared for the finishing of textiles. The crease-resistant angle enhancement of the composite-finished fabric suggests that ZnO nanoparticles/chitosan composite form a network hybrid matrix on the fabric [202]."

      "text" : "Intermolecular cross-link between long-chain CNT and cellulose molecular chains via a crosslinking agent impart crease resistance properties to cotton fabric. In fact, cross-linkage between CNTs and the fabric creates a network and reduces the flexibility of molecular chains. Therefore, the crease recovery angle of fabrics is increased. For example, Amini et al. used multiwall CNTs in order to increase wrinkle-free properties of cotton fabric via succinic acid as the cross-linker and SHP. The obtained results confirm the notable effect of CNTs in reducing fiber flexibility [203]. In a patent, Alimohammadi et al. used CNTs for textile production. The CNTembedded textiles are more antibacterial, conductive, crease resistant, flame retardant, thermally stable, and EM energy absorbent than raw textiles. They prepared seven cotton samples treated with a solution including the crosslinking agent, catalyst SHP, and CNT with different concentrations of 100, 250, 500, 1000, and 1500 ppm. According to their results, above a CNT concentration of 250 ppm, the crease-resistant properties of CNT-embedded cotton are better than raw cotton [204]."

      "text" : "Binding cellulose and chitosan nanoparticles as a polycation via intermolecular inclusion interaction decreases the possibility of molecular chains movement, hydrogen bonds breaking, and creasing the fibers. Also, the presence of a cross-linking agent is considered as a necessary factor to obtain desirable results. Although, chitosan nanoparticles have a positive effect on crease resistance, chitosan micro particles completely cover the surface and prevent the crosslinkage between the fabric and the cross-linking agent [205]. Lu et al. prepared hydroxypropyl chitosan (HCS) nanoparticles through ion-gel technology and applied it onto Antheraea pernyi (A. perny) silk fabric in the presence of 1,2,3,4-butane tetracarboxylic acid and sodium hypophosphite by a conventional pad-dry-cure process. According to their results, treatment of A. pernyi silk fabric with HCS nanoparticles strengthened the wrinkle-resistant property [206]. In another study, Cheng et al. synthesized chitosan nanoparticles with a size distribution of 15–45 nm and a good dispersity and stability. Then, they characterized the influences of nano-chitosan on antibacterial and wrinkle-resistant performances of Mulberry silk fabrics. The results indicated that Mulberry silk fabrics treated with appropriate mass fraction of nano-chitosan have an enhanced wrinkle-resistant performance [207]. Also, Zulfiqar et al. synthesized chitosan nanoparticles (CsNPs) by using ionic gelation method and then applied it on the cotton fabric utilizing the pad-dry-cure approach.\nFunctional Finishing of Textiles via Nanomaterials 57\nBased on the results, the higher crease resistance angle was due to the polycation nanoparticles which easily moved into the inter fiber region and bound the fibers to provide better crease recovery [208]."

      "text" : "The present status of the global textile market is based on innovations in high-tech textile products, and nanotechnology is one of the prominent driving forces, which helps the technical textiles stay ahead of the competition. The textile industry is affected by two main factors, that is, market volatility and world-wide competition. Therefore, the industry needs to enhance its capability to produce and market high quality and added value products. Recently, with dramatic growth in nanotechnology, increased volumes of engineered nanoparticles have been produced which represent the potential functional benefits in a wide range of applications by integrating into textiles. Among different types of nano materials, polymeric nanostructures, metal oxides, CNTs, clay nanoparticles, carbon black, graphite nanofibers (GNF), and others provide an unprecedented level of textile performance such as being hydrophilic and hydrophobic, antimicrobial, anti-odor, stain-resistant, anti-static, wrinkle resistant, anti-UV, and so on. These materials are transparent due to their high surface area and nanoscale dimension, and do not blur the color and brightness of the textile substrates. They improve the properties of textiles by their own unique characteristic, as well. In fact, finishing with different nano materials can convert fabrics into versatile multifunctional materials.\nRegardless of positive aspects of nano materials in textile finishing, there are still a lot of items to be taken into consideration. The first issue is cost, which in some cases limit the development of nano material coating on textiles and mass production. Development of products via nano structured materials remains an expensive affair and demands R&D spending in the textile industry. On the other hand, the durability of nano-finished textiles is notable. The challenge is to ensure the fastness of nano-structured finishing agents on fabric during usage and against different factors such as washing, rubbing, light, temperature, humidity, etc. However, regardless of its prosperous future, the main challenges that still need to be resolved in today’s nano-finished textiles are as follows:\nIncrease the durability and maintainability of nano-based properties on textiles after repeated using cycles."

New generation of the finishing agents integrate the nanoscale structure with eco-friendly properties, which produce dramatic characteristics without harmful effects on environment and the human health."

In such times, when microbial resistance to synthetic organic compounds like drugs and antibiotics are rampantly increasing, metal and metal oxide-based inorganic nano-particles (NP) have taken a pivotal role in preparing such antimicrobial fibers and textile materials. Incorporation of antimicrobial NP, for example, NP of Ag, Cu, ZnO, Au, and titania, in fibers and fabrics via nano-coating or nano-finishing presented promising results and excellent bioactivity. These active nano-reinforced textile structures are potential candidates for application in various areas such as sportswear, upholstery, hospital curtains, surgery gowns, medical textiles, wound dressings, bandages, etc. However, research concerning its nano-toxicological impact to human health and environment is still at its infancy and has considerably been questioned its several applications. This chapter reviews the state-of-the-art NP-based antimicrobial textile fibers and fabrics, both man-made and natural with special emphasis on toxicological properties and its effect on commercial applications.\nKeywords: Fibers, textiles, metal NP, antimicrobial, nano-toxicological studies\n*Corresponding author: mangala@textile.iitd.ac.in"

      "text" : "Textile materials provide ample ambient conditions of temperature, humidity, and nutrition for pathogenic micro-organisms to thrive and multiply on their surface and proliferate into the surrounding environment [1–3]. The exponential multiplication of micro-organisms is assisted by internal factors of the human body, such as accumulation of sweat, dead skin cells, oil secreted by sebaceous glands, as well as external parameters like dust, stains caused by spilled food and drinks, nature of finishing chemical, etc. As a consequence, imparting antimicrobial property to textile fabrics and fibers by different methods such as finishing or coating has become one of the utmost significant research field in the modern world [4–6]. The global antimicrobial finishing market is expected to rise by a compound annual growth rate of 20% to 25% as per recent market surveys and is estimated to reach 2.9 billion dollars by 2018 [7]. In addition to providing improvement in human living standards, it controls allergic reactions, lethal infections, cross-infections of microbe-transmitted diseases, and other harmful health effects [8–11]. Antimicrobial finishes on textiles prevent microbial attack in the material which is responsible for maintaining its aesthetic and functional value. Degradation of the fibers and dyes leading to loss of local color or undesirable staining is prevented along with unpleasant odor associated with bacterial colonization. Currently, antimicrobial fabrics and fibers are increasingly being used in various sectors such as protective, medical, technical and decorative, and sportswear textiles with vast application areas from hospital environment to daily household items [12–16].\nMicrobes are defined as a class of living micro-organisms, both unicellular and multicellular, that include bacteria, fungi, algae, virus, archaea, and protozoa [17–19]. The phyla of fungi includes yeasts (unicellular), rusts, smuts, mildews, molds, and mushrooms (multicellular). A large number of microbes co-exist in the human society with harmony, in the immediate surroundings and inside the bodies of living organisms [20– 23]. Although it is conceived that majority of microbes are pathogenic and exert harmful ill-effects on the health, in reality, majority of them are completely harmless [24–26] and some even help us in bodily functions like digestion (Escherichia coli) and preparation of nutrient-containing food such as bread (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) [27], citric acid (Aspergillus niger) [28], riboflavin (Eremothecium sp.) and even has medicinal uses such as antibiotic isolation [29]. Some bacteria do not cause fatal or highrisk diseases but are associated with unpleasant smell and overall bad hygiene [30]. The human skin itself is a home to a microbiota of diverse species ranging from bacteria and viruses to yeasts, prokaryotes, and fungi\nAntimicrobial Textiles Using Nano-particles 73\n[31]. The environment humidity (moist or dry) and the composition of the clothing enclosing the skin have a strong effect on the type of residing bacteria [32–34]. An interesting study [35] found significantly different microbiomes on different clothing fabrics. Highest malodor was observed for polyester fabrics with infestations of Micrococci, Enhydrobacter, and Propionibacterium sp. owing to inherent low moisture uptake. Cotton fabrics showed a predominant strain of Staphylococcus hominis while both the fabrics showed growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Wool clothing promoted growth of almost all bacteria and nylon fabrics exhibited promoted growth of Propionibacterium sp., Staphylococcus sp., and Enhydrobacter sp. The Propionibacterium sp. are mainly responsible for unpleasant odor associated with nylon socks and thrives well in most areas such as foot [36].\nThe present decade has witnessed frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases with increase in microbial resistance to antibiotics and drugs based on organic structures [37]. Conventionally, textiles were treated with antimicrobial formulations based on the antimicrobial property of complex organic compounds such as quaternary ammonium salts, N-halamines, halogenated phenols like triclosan, polybiguanides, etc. [38–43]. Alternatively, antimicrobial textile substrates were developed using natural extracts, biopolymers, and bio-based NP [44–49]. Depending upon the mechanism of antimicrobial action of the active agent impregnated within the textile material, the textile may be termed as “bacteriostatic” when the growth of micro-organisms is inhibited or “bacteriocidal” when the active agents impart antimicrobial action by killing the bacteria corresponding to bound and leeching types of antimicrobial agents, respectively [38].\nWith the advent of nano-technology, considerable research studies have focused on a new class of antimicrobials which are inorganic in nature like metal and metal oxide NP based on Ag, Cu, CuO, ZnO, and titania NP [50–54] unlike the conventionally used organic antimicrobials. These biologically active nano-materials are highly potent even at very low concentrations while having zero microbial resistance with other advantages such as multi-targeted action, unique small size, large surface-to-volume ratio, and unique physiochemical properties. Several studies are oriented toward achieving antimicrobial textile materials with incorporation of these inorganic NP that provide fast and easy functionalization with excellent effectiveness and long durability [55–62]. However, owing to their metallic nature, the NP above the threshold limit can hamper normal cell division and proliferation even in humans due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can cause inflammation and allergy along with other minor complications [63–64]. This drawback has put a leash on the everexpanding market of nano-scale-based antimicrobials. The toxicological"

      "text" : "data of these NP are elucidated primarily in water and cell media, which is a far cry from the complex in vivo environment of the human body [65–66]. Although Ag salt-based burn creams and gels are a commercial triumph, Ag NP having significantly higher affectivity face difficulty in penetrating the market due to unavailability of sufficient data confirming its non-toxic nature [67–68].\nVarious standard test methods, both qualitative and quantitative, are available for testing antimicrobial-finished textile fibers and fabrics. The AATCC Test Method 100: 1999 and AATCC Test Method 147: 1998 are most popular methods to test the efficacy of antimicrobial textile materials although AATCC Test Method 90: 1998 is also frequently employed. The AATCC Test Method 147: 1998, Parallel Steak method, is a fast and qualitative measurement of the antimicrobial activity in which a rectangular cut fabric sample (25 mm ´ 50 mm) is placed on a sterile nutrient agar plate parallel streaked with inoculations of Gram-positive or Gram-negative strain. The amount of bacterial growth on the petridish and on the textile after the incubation period of 18–24 h gives a qualitative method of antibacterial activity. In the AATCC Test Method 100: 1999, Colony Counting method, a swatch of fabric with a certain weight or dimension is inoculated with bacterial solution and incubated at ambient conditions. After the swatches are removed, the number of bacteria in the extract is determined using serial dilution and agar plating technique. This is an accurate quantitative test method and by far the most popular as the results are reproducible. The AATCC Test Method 90: 1998 Disk Diffusion Test is only suitable for antimicrobial fabrics that have leaching chemicals that can detach itself from the fabric and form a zone of inhibition. In this test procedure, the small swatch of fabric is placed on the center of surface-inoculated pertidish. The clear zone surrounding the sample is quantified after 18–24 h incubation period. Other test methods for antimicrobial textiles include ASTM test methods such as the ASTM E 2149 Test Method for determining the antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial agents under dynamic contact conditions, the ASTM E 2180 Test Method for determining the activity of incorporated antimicrobial agents in polymeric or hydrophobic materials, and the ASTM E 2722 Test Method for using Seeded-Agar for the screening assessment of antimicrobial activity in fabric and air filter media.\nThe antifungal properties of a textile material are generally evaluated using the AATCC Test Method 30: 1999. The standard provides four methods for evaluation of fungal growth on the textile substrate to be classified as “‘no growth”, “microscopic growth”, or “macroscopic growth” accompanied with the determination of tensile strength loss due to fungus-induced\nAntimicrobial Textiles Using Nano-particles 75\ndeterioration in the fabric. The first method tests the extent of growth of fungi in the test sample of dimension 4 15 cm buried and incubated in fungi-inoculated soil for 2 to 16 weeks at 28 °C. The second and third method involves growth of fungi Chaetomiumglobosum and fungi A. niger, respectively, in an inoculated petridish having a circular (4 cm diameter) or rectangular specimen (4 15 cm) placed at the center. The last method involves a 2.5 7.6 cm specimen-introduced sealed jar seeded with three fungi mixtures at a high humidity environment for 14 to 28 days. The extent of fungal growth in the samples is taken as a direct measure of antifungal activity."

      "text" : "Ag has been used as a sign of prosperity since ancient times by royal families with Ag cutleries and crockeries considered epitome of high standard life [55]. The excellent biological activity of Ag was long known and has been used through ages as a medium to fight infectious ailments. Ag compounds and ions have been used for centuries to treat contaminated water to render it potable and life-sustaining [51, 55]. Among the different metallic NP used in antimicrobial finishing of textiles, Ag NP is by far the most prominently used due to highest effectiveness at lowest concentration. Ag NP inhibit almost 650 different types of pathogenic bacteria and five strains of yeast; however, its affectivity toward mildew, mold, and fungus is limited, probably because it falls into the category of non-essential elements of nutrition [69–71]. In the present decade, Ag-based finishes both in NP and bulk form have unprecedented market application in not only textile, but also plastic, chemical, pharmaceuticals, and hygiene industries [72–73]. Ag resin columns and Ag zeolites have been used since long in water filters and pharmaceutical applications [74–75]. Ag salts such as silver sulfadiazine have been extensively used in burn bandages and wound dressings [76–77]. The use of AgNO3 as a finishing chemical to impart antimicrobial activity is often accompanied with a dark brown–black stain on exposure to air, heat, or light caused by uncontrolled reduction of Ag ions to form bigger metallic Ag particles [78–79].\nThe size, shape, and crystallinity of Ag NP have a profound effect on its antimicrobial behavior with the non-spherical shapes such as polygonal, triangular, and poly-hierarchical morphologies which have a higher"

However, the method of synthesis, that is, reduction route, type of chemicals, and process parameters, also affects the end properties [68]. The synthesis of Ag NP can be broadly categorized into top-down and bottom-up approaches. In the bottom-up approach, which is used predominantly for synthesis purpose, Ag NP are produced by both physical deposition and chemical precipitation methods. Chemical deposition routes often require harsh non-environment-friendly surfactants and reducing agents. The precursor salt is most often AgNO3 as it offers advantages of comparatively low cost and chemical stability although silver acetate is also in use [82]. The reducing agents used are sodium borohydride, sodium citrate, and hydrazine hydrate as mostly used; however, ethanol, DMF, ascorbic acid, aldehydes, and isopropanol are also employed [83–86]. The capping agents used to cease particle growth and prevent agglomerated superstructures are mainly PVP and citrate salts with uses of amines, CTAB, sugars, and PVA also mentioned in the current literature [68, 84–86]. With growing concern about environmental hazards with the release of toxic byproducts and reagents into the immediate surroundings, green synthesis has found significant focus in recent times. Plant extracts, biological agents, and microbe-mediated metabolism byproducts that are capable of donating free electrons are increasingly reported as potential reducing agents to combat and replace hazardous reducing chemicals [87–90]. Physical deposition routes of synthesizing Ag NP include UV-irradiation, calcination at moderately elevated temperatures, and plasma treatment [91–93]. The top approach for synthesis which employs laser ablation techniques and nanolithography to reduce particle down is comparatively less reported due to difficulty in controlling the morphology and thereby leading to imperfectly shaped NP [68]."

      "text" : "TiO2 or titania is the natural oxide form of titanium and has been used generously in a variety of applications in cosmetic, paints, paper, plastic, and textile industry for decades [95–96]. Titania is a semi-conducting material with one of the strongest photo-catalytic activities with high oxidizing power, long-term stability, and low cost [97]. The high refractive index and good light-scattering property of the material make it possible to impart considerable whiteness and opacity to its product even at very low concentrations. Titania is considered to be chemically and biologically inert, and hence accepted as a food and pharmaceutical additive for artificial food coloring, dental pastes, tablets, oral capsules, suspensions, and\nAntimicrobial Textiles Using Nano-particles 77\ndermal ointments and creams [54, 98–99]. With breakthrough research on nano-science and nano-technology and development of nano-materials as an improved version of the parent materials with unique value-added properties, TiO2 NP or nano-titania became increasingly important having unique photocatalytic, optical, UV-shielding, and antimicrobial properties making it suitable for a plethora of applications in various market sectors [95, 99, 100–101]. In the textile industry, nano-titania is popular in “selfcleaning” textiles for obtaining impurity-free surfaces and self-disinfecting nature by self-decomposition of dirt and organic pollutant molecules under accelerated photo-catalytic reaction [50, 102–104].\nCrystalline TiO2 exhibits three different polymorphs—anatase, rutile, and brookite—among which anatase exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity. However, the commercial nano-titania powder available for antibacterial studies contains 80:20 mixture of anatase and rutile [105]. Titania NP are generally obtained by the sol–gel precipitation method in which titanium isopropoxide is normally stirred with ammonium hydroxide, and the end-point of the reaction is confirmed when a change of color from purple to white precipitate is obtained [95,98]. When UV light is illuminated, a positive hole is photo-generated in the valence band when excitation causes electrons to jump from valence to conduction band. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as O2*, H2O2, and HO* are generated via redox reactions between electron-hole and adsorbed oxygen and water. ROS are known to induce oxidative stress inside the bacterial cell and contribute toward bactericidal action [98–100]. Studies shown on E. coli bacteria demonstrates that OH radicals were major contributors toward oxidative stress; its high reactivity makes crevices on the outer wall that subsequently leads to drainage of cytoplasmic fluid [100]. Nano-titania with spherical crystallites <30 nm diameter exhibits strong photo-catalytic disinfection action against many strains of bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus epidermis, E. coli, Bacillus sp.), fungi (Aspergillus sp.), algae, and virus [99, 104–105], although their MIC values are pronouncedly less than Ag-based systems [106–107]."

In fact, old-age Hindu traditions believed throwing coins in water would fulfill wishes, and it was considered a good practice as Cu coins purified the water, making it potable. Cu, unlike Ag, is an essential trace element that is present in all living tissues and is crucial for growth and development of many micro-organisms including human [110–111]. Cu is a well-established element with antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, insecticidal, and molluscicidal properties [112– 113]. Cu salts such as CuSO4 have been extensively used as a fungicide in agricultural applications [114]. However, its toxicity at higher doses, especially to marine and aquatic life, has restricted its widespread commercial applications in recent times [115]. With the advent of nano-technology, research on the synthesis of Cu and CuO NP was focused to bring antimicrobial effects at lower concentration and less toxicity [38, 55,116].\nThe current literature on the synthesis of Cu NP can be classified broadly into three categories by physical, chemical, and biological means. Like synthesis of Ag NP, most researchers focus on the bottom-up approach by wet chemical routes as the scope of controlling the size of NP is higher. In wet chemical routes, the precursor Cu salts such as CuSO4, in aqueous or ethanol media using reducing agents such as sodium borohydride, hydrazine, ascorbic acid, etc., are reported [117–118]. Recently, extracts from plants, that is, extracts from the plant Terminalia arjuna and from the leaves of Lawsonia inermis (henna), are employed as reducing agents and/ or capping agents [119–120]. These methods of reduction are environment friendly and avoid direct usage of harsh reducing agents. The reverse emulsion method containing surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water micro-emulsion acting as nano-reactors for the formation of Cu NP is another well-known procedure where shape and size are easily controllable [121–122]. The physical routes for synthesis include microwave irradiation, thermal treatment, electrochemical synthesis, ultra-sonication technology via acoustic cavitation, etc. [38, 123]. In an attempt to develop non-toxic, reliable, and green process routes, efforts are being put into modern studies to focus on biological synthesis [124–125]. The bacterial strain of Pseudomonas stutzeri isolated from soil was successful in producing cubic-shaped Cu NP of 50- to 150-nm diameter [125]. The synthesis of CuO NP is generally accomplished by hydrolysis of precursor Cu salt followed by dehydration. CuO NP relatively has more physical and chemical stability than pure Cu NP [126]. Cu and CuO NP are found effective against a wide range of both Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria, for example, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, E. coli, Micrococcus luteus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae as well as different strains of fungi such as Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, and Candida albicans [55, 127]. The antifungal activities of Cu-based NP were\nAntimicrobial Textiles Using Nano-particles 79\nhigher than Ag NP of a similar diameter as Cu is relevant to the biochemical reactions of organisms and is readily taken up by fungi that consider Cu as a nutrient [128]."

It is responsible for growth and differentiation, utilized in redox processes, and they regulate osmotic pressure as well as maintain ionic balance. In lower organisms, as the Zn concentration reaches higher levels, depending on the type of micro-organism, it starts exerting its cytotoxic nature [131–132]. It has been postulated that it hampers the generation time of an organism by prolonging the lag phase of the cycle responsible for growth. Additionally, it alters the semi-permeable nature of the cell membrane preventing calcium uptake by controlling the enzymes responsible for membrane permeability [133–137].\nNano-ZnO represents a significant class of metal oxide NP possessing excellent antimicrobial action with lowest toxicity to human cells [132]. Its virtues make it highly recommendable in the food industry and in biomedical applications where an optimal balance has to be sustained between safety to human health and potent biocidal property [138–139]. Its UV shielding property has been rampantly used as active ingredients in skin lotions, creams, and sunscreens [138–140]. ZnO NP are also used in sensors, electronic devices, energy-harvesting materials, and in optical absorption due to its semi-conducting, photo-catalytic, and piezoelectric nature [140]. Different shapes of ZnO nano-structures, namely nano-rods, nanospheres, nano-wires, nano-needles, and nano-rings, have been reported by controlling physical parameters and chemical parameters such as temperature, pH, solvent type, and precursor concentration [140–141]. Some of the most adopted technologies for synthesis of ZnO nano-structures include thermal evaporation, hydrothermal synthesis, sol–gel technique, simple thermal sublimation, self-combustion, polymerized complex method, vapor–liquid–solid technique, double-jet precipitation, and chemical solution synthesis [138–141]. Spherical shaped ZnO NP synthesized by the wet chemical process using a Zn precursor salt such as Zn acetate dihydrate and strong alkali like sodium hydroxide have currently been explored for antimicrobial activity and have been found to exhibit strong microbial resistance to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria like E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, S. acidaminiphila, and P. aeruginosa [141–143].

      "text" : "Among different metal NP used for antimicrobial functionalization of textile materials, Ag NP are by far the most preferred choice over other NP, because of high potency at low concentration. Additionally, most research attention is focused on antimicrobial functionalization of cotton fabrics, mainly because it is most prone to microbial degradation and is used extensively in non-implantable medical textiles such as wound dressings, bandages, gauze fabrics, uniforms, and caps [4, 38, 57, 144]. Surface modification or finishing has been done using various application techniques such as dip-coating, pad-dry-cure method, layer-by-layer coating, plasma treatment, or in situ reduction [55]. According to the International Standard Organization, an NP is defined as a particle as a whole having a diameter <100 nm in all three dimensions. However, any particle between 100 nm and 1000 nm, which essentially contains clusters of individual NP, is also termed as NP in the textile world [55]. By this definition, some of the Ag salts impregnated into the textile fabric are also NP as they are clusters of Ag crystals in nano-meter range. With vast expanding areas of research conducted on antimicrobial Ag NP-based chemistry, excellent bioactive textile fabrics are readily available. However, although the binding mechanism of Ag NP onto textile substrates is not fully elucidated, effectiveness of antimicrobial activity is greatly reduced with strong chemical binding in the interface. This raises a huge concern for the detrimental drainage of nano-Ag into the immediate environment with successive washing cycles [145–146]. The toxicological shock represents a potential research area where future investigation must be directed to achieve commercial success of NP-based biochemistry onto textile substrates [67]. Unlike thermoplastic polymers, where incorporation of Ag NP can be carried out at various stages, impregnation in fibers and in fabrics can only be done at the final stage in which NP are applied as a finishing technique. Emam et al. [147] argue that functional household cellulosic textiles show a significant pick up of Ag NP and subsequent antibacterial activity through simple immersing in AgNO3 aqueous solution and therefore the researches which articulate incorporation of reducing and stabilizing agents, whether physical or chemical or bio-based, only complicate the methodology without bringing\nAntimicrobial Textiles Using Nano-particles 81\nout better functional attributes. However, the concentration of the Ag nano-sol has a significant control over its laundered antimicrobial activity. Low concentrations (less than 10 ppm) may not be suitable for longterm antimicrobial activity and high concentrations upto 50 ppm may be required to achieve a desirable effect.\nThe morphological shape of the Ag NP is a determining factor in deciding the extent of bio-activity. Different morphologies of synthesized Ag NP—spheres, flat nano-plates, nano-prisms, polygonal and hierarchical by chemical reduction route have been applied on different cotton fabrics using ultra-sonication technology at suitable temperature [148]. The fabrics treated with hierarchical Ag NP evaluated against E. coli and S. aureus showed the best activity of >91% after five washing cycles.\nSeveral studies are tuned toward in situ reduction of Ag NP directly on the textile substrate. Perelshtein et al. [149] prepared antibacterial cotton, nylon, and polyester fabrics using the dip-coating method using a solution of AgNO3 salt precursor and ethylene glycol in aqueous media. The fabric was further sono-chemically treated for immobilization of Ag NP effective against E. coli and S. aureus. Liu et al. [150] reported a simple yet effective one-pot synthesis method for fabricating a cotton bandage for biomedical applications with excellent activity toward E. coli and S. aureus. The nano-coating on cotton was carried out by dipping cotton fabric in ethanol-mediated AgNO3 and butylamine solution. Lee et al. [151] developed bioactive cotton and a polyester-woven fabric by simply dipping in Ag nano-sol stabilized in ethanol. Rajavel et al. [152] demonstrated yet another simple method for producing cotton fabrics with durable antimicrobial finishing by dipping the fabric in AgNO3 and subsequently sodium borohydride solution under static conditions. The authors optimized the concentrations of the solution to maximize loading and distribution and reported that low concentrations of both precursor (1 m M Ag NO3) and reductant (0.5 m M borohydride) are beneficial for optimum results. The treated fabrics showed yellowish coloration and bioactivity against B. subtilis and S. sonnei for potential use in wound dressing. Antimicrobial cotton fabrics pre-activated with potassium hydroxide, dipped into AgNO3 and ascorbic acid solution, and further treated with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane to coat with a low surface energy barrier layer were reported by ShateriKhalilabad et al. [153]. The same research group reported pre-activation of cotton fabrics with alkali treatment to maximize loading [154]. The in situ NP-embedded hydrophobic fabric showed good laundering stability and antimicrobial action against E. coli and S. aureus.

A schematic of the paddry-cure method and the corresponding TEM image of the Ag NPs as outlined by Hebeish et al. [86] has been outlined in Figure 2.1.\nApart from in situ reduction, considerable research activities were carried out to fabricate antimicrobial textiles using ex situ precipitated Ag NP. El-Rafie et al. [156] reported antibacterial cotton fabrics finished with Ag NP by dipping in a colloidal solution of Ag NP and an acrylate-based binder. The prepared fabrics were effective against E. coli and S. aureus. Hanh et al. [157] prepared polyester–cotton-blend fabric coated with Ag NP by the pad-dry-cure method. The Ag NP were previously prepared ex situ by γ-radiation of AgNO3 chitosan solution, chitosan acting as a stabilizing as well as binding agent. The fabric showed acceptable performance as a wrapper in patient’s bed in the hospital where chances of cross-infections are high. Alkali-hydrolyzed alginate solution has been used as a reducing and stabilizing agent for the synthesis of Ag NP and further used for finishing of cotton fabrics by the pad-dry-cure method. In another study by Hebeish et al. [158], carboxy methyl cellulose hyrdrogel-based Ag NP has been used as a finishing agent on cotton fabrics through the pad-dry-cure route. Multifunctional wool fabrics functionalized with different morphologies of ex situ prepared Ag NP by the dip coating method were developed by Tang et al. [159]. The prism and disk-shaped NP imparted brilliant and uniform coloration of blue, red, and yellow to wool fabrics due to localized surface plasmon resonance. Montazer et al.

The multifunctional fabric showed antimicrobial activity and resistance to creasing without undesirable color formation. In another study by Yuranova et al. [161], polyester and polyamide fabrics were pretreated with both RF-plasma and Vacuum-UV radiation for surface modification to maximize Ag loading and further treated with AgNO3. Zhang et al. [162] developed ex situ nano-colloidal Ag NP using an amino-terminated hyper-branched polymer as a reducing agent and a finishing agent for cotton fabric. Yeo et al. [163] reported a bicomponent PP sheath-core filament with Ag NP incorporated in the sheath part for enhanced bioactivity. Majumder et al.

The authors reported a decrease in the count of yarn, and an increase in machine gauge increases antimicrobial activity and the fabrics showed ~1% of antimicrobial loss after 25 washes. A comparison study between in situ and ex situ approach for deposition of Ag NP on cotton fabric was presented by Perera et al. [165].

Dubas et al. [167] reported better uniformity in nano-coating for silk fibers than nylon fibers, the antibacterial efficiency being 80% and 50% bacterial colonies reduction for silk and nylon, respectively, against S. aureus. Sataev et al. [168] invented a novel method of nano-coating in which fabrics are first treated with CuSO4 solution by either dipping or spraying and further treated with phosphine to obtain copper phosphide and silver nitrate to obtain a silver phosphide coating of 40–600 nm thickness. The fabrics retained bactericidal efficacy after 10 washes. Ag NP (~20 nm) in another study reported by Budama et al. [169] were synthesized as reverse micelle cores using polystyrene-block-polyacrylic acid (PS-b-PAA) as a copolymer, polymerized in situ by atom transfer radical polymerization. Further, cotton fabrics were padded with the copolymer-Ag solution enabling esterification reaction between hydroxyl groups of cellulose and corona (PAA). The fabrics were effective against E. coli for up to 5 washes and S. aureus for up to 20 washes. Cotton gauze fabrics for wound healing applications finished with Ag oxide NP were reported by Gouda et al. [170]. The NP synthesis was carried out in situ by dipping the fabrics in successive baths of precursor salt containing AgNO3 and reducing bath containing hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide at pH 9.5. The fabric was further batched and dried and showed effective reduction of colonies against S. typhimurium, S. aureus, C. albicans, and A. flavus. It has been opined by Dastjerdi et al. [171] that there is binding force playing between the textile substrate and the inorganic NP due to difference in surface energies between the two phases and hence the authors devised a functional coating based on polysiloxane modified with nano-Ag which is applied to PET fabric by the pad-dry-cure route. The polysiloxane polymeric layer on the fabric makes it resistant to heat, light, and microbial attack in addition to providing it with anti-static property, eliminating the use of spin finish step.\nSince Ag NP have extreme tendency to agglomerate and form clusters of metallic Ag, thereby decreasing its antimicrobial potency manifold, considerable research has been oriented toward achieving stable NP with supporting materials targeted toward maximum achievable functional augmentation. Silica-Ag core shell NP represent a significantly important class, with silica core offering advantages of sufficient compatibility, inert\nAntimicrobial Textiles Using Nano-particles 85\nnature, and excellent heat resistance to support the peripherally located Ag NP [172]. Extremely lower sizes of Ag NP can be developed up to 1–2 nm in diameter deposited on the silica core having 270 nm diameter using one-pot chemical synthesis route as reported by Nischala et al. [172]. Cotton fabrics with silica-Ag NP immobilized by the pad-dry-cure method exhibited excellent activity against E. coli and retained its bioactivity up to acceptable standards after 10 washing cycles. Silica-Ag core shell particles have also been explored on natural fibers like wool and silk and man-made fibers like polyester and polyamide. Ag NP capped with dodecanethiol 1–5 nm in size was synthesized by the two-phase arrested micro-emulsion technique, and subsequently applied to the cotton fabric by padding it in nano-Ag sol, as reported by Tarimala et al. [173]. Cotton dressing for burn wounds with good bioactivity has been reported by Parikh et al. [174] using Ag-modified sodium carboxy methyl cellulose.\nTitania doped with Ag NP by the sol–gel synthesis route using titanium isopropoxide and AgNO3 as precursor salts has been another significant research area addressing toward the stabilization issue stemming from nano-scale-sized Ag NP. Degoutin et al. [175] reported woven cotton fabric, spun-bonded PP fabric, and a cotton/non-woven PET blend fabric with durable bioactivity against E. coli and S. aureus. The fabrics except the woven cotton fabric have been surface-modified in the first step to make it hydrophilic using RF plasma and acrylic acid as a monomer. All the fabrics are subsequently impregnated with titania-doped Ag NP using pad-drycure and electrospray process. Anatase titania coated with 1% Ag NP has been used to prepare isotactic polypropylene filaments by the melt compounding route in a twin screw extruder in concentration of 0.2–0.5 wt% as reported by Dastjerdi et al. [176]. The addition of a TiO2–Ag nano-filler did not hamper processability and showed comparable mechanical activity with a neat filament. Montazer et al. [177] developed Ag-loaded titania NP through the photo-reduction route for functionalization of wool fabrics. The immobilization in wool fabrics effective against E. coli and S. aureus was carried out via padding using citric acid as a cross-linker.\nThe last decade witnessed tremendous growth in Ag NP-incorporated textiles fabricated through physical deposition methods to minimize toxicity associated with chemicals required for wet reduction for Ag NP. This includes techniques such as ultrasonic frequency treatment, UV irradiation, and plasma treatment. Lu et al. [178] developed an antimicrobial silk fabric with crystalline Ag NP immobilized on the surface by UV irradiation. UV irradiation was also employed by Montazer et al.

Nano-Ag coating assisted by high power impulse\nAntimicrobial Textiles Using Nano-particles 87\nmagnetron sputtering on PET fabrics has been developed by Chen et al. [182]. This method is advantageous as high density plasma is capable of producing adhesion between film and PET at comparatively lower temperature of substrates.

In an attempt to reduce environmental toxicity which is a matter of great concern of date, natural resources such as starch, natural gums, cyclodextrin, and chitosan used as a reducing and stabilizing agent have been reported. Chitosan, a natural polysaccharide and a derivative of glucose family formed from chitin found in the exoskeleton of arthropods, is a non-toxic, biodegradable, and polycationic biocompatible antibacterial agent [184–185]. Ag cations are known to form chelate complexes with amino and hydroxyl groups of chitosan enabling chemical modification and functionalization. The emulsion containing a synergistic complex of chitosan-Ag is applied to fabrics by the conventional pad-dry-cure procedure, or the finishing technique has an excellent activity toward E. coli and S. aureus and shows resistance against alkaline laundering [186]. Such finished fabrics have the advantages of low add-on percentage preventing undesirable color generation usually associated with Ag NP-finished fabrics. Cotton fabrics bound with naturally synthesized Ag NP through the pad-dry-cure route with an excellent antibacterial activity have been demonstrated by Hebeish et al. [86]. The NP have been synthesized using hydroxypropyl starch as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The authors further showed that the presence of binder was essential to retain antimicrobial activity after laundering cycles. Mahltig et al.

Green synthesis of Ag NP was also attempted using Erigeron annuus (L.) pers flower extract used as a reducing and capping agent by Velmurugan et al. [188]. The Ag NP were further attached to cotton fabrics under ultrasonic treatment and were found to be effective against S. epidermis and B. linens. Ravindra et al.

In situ generation of titania NP in both phases—anatase and rutile—onto cotton textile substrate has been demonstrated in a simple one-step synthesis method using ultrasonic irradiation by Perelshtein et al. [193]. Crystalline titania NP obtained by acoustic cavitation and deposited in situ without necessitating further heating of the fabric to elevated temperatures (300 °C for anatase and 600 °C for rutile) have been first reported. Through photo-catalysis invisible-light, the fabrics showed activity against E.coli, S. aureus, and C. albicans. In situ sono-chemical synthesis of anatase titania NP on cotton fabrics at low temperatures was reported by Sadr et al. [194]. In another method outlined by Daoud et al.

Anita et al. [202] described a method to produce microencapsulated CuO NP for finishing of the cotton fabric. CuO NP of size ~50 nm were produced by the wet chemical method with CuSO4, sodium hydroxide, and starch and further encapsulated with sodium alginate by the ionic gelation process using a sprayer. The plain weave cotton fabrics finished with microcapsule-CuO NP using the exhaustion process followed by pad-dry-cure showed activity against E. coli and S. aureus and showed better laundering durability than only CuO NP-finished fabrics. Gabbay et al. [203] described a multi-soaking procedure to impregnate cotton fibers with CuO NP.\nAbramova et al.

The authors reported CuO NP-incorporated cotton fabrics coated uniformly having activity against E. coli, S. aureus, K. pneumonia, and MRSA. To take the NP finishing of textiles further, a pilot-scale sonochemical coating plant has been successfully developed [205].

Although many scientific literatures are available to support beneficial attributes, the mechanism of biocidal action of metal-based NP is poorly understood and has many schools of thought [216–217]. The intrinsic chemistry of the NP is an important parameter in determining the extent and strength of antimicrobial action and is chiefly governed by three intrinsic factors—the reduction potential of the metal, its solubility in cytoplasmic fluid, and metal donor atom selectivity. These three factors play an important role in the multi-targeted action mechanism unique of NP [56, 216–218]. The mechanism of toxicity of the nanoparticles against bacteria is schematically outlined in Figure 2.5."

Therefore, monovalent and divalent cations are electrostatically attracted toward the outer membrane. The membrane houses transporter-specific (ABC transporters and P-type transporters) or unspecific (MIT transporters) regulating the intake or excretion of proteins and nutrients [219–220]. Cu and Zn ions are permitted to enter through ion channels as they belong to a class of essential nutrients. Cu can also cause membrane impairment through lipid peroxidation, attacking the integrity of the cell. Ag is known to cause leakage of protons through the cell by unbalancing the chemi-osmotic force across the membrane. Some cations can bind with transporters inhibiting complete assimilation of ions [220]."

Therefore, they act as a catalyst in promoting Fenton reaction between Fe and H2O2 generating ROS. Metal cations such as Ag, which are nonFenton–active, displace Fe in coordination ligands through ionic or molecular mimicry and release Fe that catalyzes Fenton reaction producing a hydroxyl ion and a hydroxyl radical. The nascent hydroxyl radical is the most potent oxidizing reactive species, readily reacting with most biomolecules. With the rise in ROS intensifying toxic oxidative stress, antioxidants inside the cell become readily depleted [223]. Thiol groups possess high affinity for metals and can get oxidized leading to the generation of more ROS. Physiological redox reactions inside the cell are thereby severely hampered [216]."

      "text" : "With exceptional functional property enhancement obtained in NP-reinforced textile substrates, nano-additive-based research activity for textile materials is one of the fastest-growing industries of date. While every day, scientific literature points toward effortless fabrication of highly active nano-structured textile substrates leveraging its beneficial effects, there is only a modest amount of studies focused on the mechanism of action and effect on the human health and global ecosystem [66–68]. NP-finished products in the due course of time are bound to release NP incidentally, starting from the time of production, during washing and usage due to erosion, leading to severe malfunction of the environmental infrastructure [225]. In order to exert toxic effects to target organisms (bacteria, fungi, algae, and virus) for which it is primarily designed and fabricated, biocide metal NP above a threshold limit starts to attack nontarget organisms (marine species, mammalians, and human) on incidental or accidental exposure. The interfaces between the human body and the immediate surroundings, for example, small pores in the skin and respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genital tracts, function as possible entry routes toward NP absorption into the inner system [226]. It is highly likely that toxic effects associated with the exposure of NP will attack the lowest trophic level, that is, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, yeast, and molds at the initial stage [227]. However, trophic transfer may result in the transmission of toxicity to higher strata of the energy pyramid, the human. Metal and metal oxide-based NP are already proven to exhibit adverse effects to bacteria, fungi, and algae even at very low concentrations, a characteristic having roots in its high specific surface area. NP dumped onto wastewater treatment plants based on outdated hazardous discharge control technologies are incompetent in removing nano-scale-sized impurities, disrupting the aquatic ecosystem [228–229]. Scientific studies based on the effect of Ag\nAntimicrobial Textiles Using Nano-particles 95\nNP on marine life indicate that very low concentration of NP, especially Ag NP, can be fatal to zebra fish, clams, and Diptera species such as Drosophila melanogaster [230–232]. Crustaceans and fishes are proven be most susceptible to the NP toxicity, in some cases more than the target organism.\nThe levels of toxicity of different NP are different due to their inherent chemistry, reactivity, and solubility. Ag NP are the most toxic of different NP used for biocidal function apart from being the most potent one too. The LC50 values (lethal concentration; concentration in water having 50% chance of causing death to aquatic life) of Ag NP reported are very low, 0.01 mg/L for crustaceans to 38 mg/L for protozoa [67]. For other NP, the LC50 values are usually below 10 mg/L, pointing toward high risks associated with nano-Ag usage. The LC50 value of CuO NP is 2–3 mg/L for crustaceans and algae and 100 mg/L for protozoa and bacteria. ZnO NP exhibit pronounced activity against algae (<0.1 mg/L) and LC50 of 10–100 mg/L against fungi, protozoa, and yeast.\nFew studies are directed toward the invivo effect of Ag NP accumulation in lower mammalian cells of species, such as rats and mice. Sung et al. [233] reported the impairment of lung functions due to inflammatory lesions in lung cells of the rat in a 90-day inhalation period. Another study conducted by Kim et al. [234] reported the accumulation of Ag in olfactory bulbs of rat and its subsequent transfer to brain tissues. In vitro studies conducted on mouse stem cells and rat liver cells indicate mitochondrial dysfunction and membrane leakage. The effects of nano-colloidal Ag of diameter 2–3 nm and 30 nm, and concentration 100 ppm on the skin condition of healthy rabbits were analyzed by Lee et al. [63]. Quite contrarily, the authors reported total skin innoxiousness for 2–3 nm NP and rare skin erythema for 30 nm NP, making 2–3 nm NP better suitable for textile applications. Gouda et al. [170] reported no clinical signs of skin erythema on adult albino rabbits patched with Ag oxide and zirconium oxide NP-impregnated cotton gauze fabrics for 4 days.\nLimited study has been done to draw conclusion on the effect of human cells. Studies on topical application of Ag NP on human fibroblastic sarcoma cells (tumor cells) and carcinoma cells (cancer cells) show reduced levels of cellular glutathione indicating ROS generation and oxidative stress buildup [235]. In a study by Asharani et al. [236], the toxicity exerted by Ag NP was researched using human lung fibroblast cells and glioblastoma cells. The authors found evidences of interruption of mitochondrial respiration chain with oxidative stress generation, disruption of ATP synthesis, and DNA damage. Ag NP exerted cytotoxic effects on both types of cells in an equal manner, giving us food for thought about serious and long-term effects of Ag NP above the threshold dose. Although some literature could be found on toxicity of Ag NP, the toxicity data on CuO and ZnO NP are relatively"

[197] advocated non-toxicity of apatite-coated titania NP on normal human dermal fibroblast cells through MTT assay in the cytotoxicity test having cell viability over 70%.\nIn the present scenario, no safety organization committee has been set up for regulating synthesis and safe usage of NP. Different metal and metal oxide NP, even though possesses unique physico-chemical properties and has been classified as new class of materials according to material scientists worldwide, are chemically similar to their bulk counterparts and therefore carry commercially the same CAS number [67]. As a result, the NP are currently judged by the nano-toxicological effect on aquatic life based on the scale set for bulk materials, which is insufficient to provide substantial evidence pertaining to their non-toxic nature. While a legislative body for the regulation of NP is the need of the hour, a fundamental elucidation and understanding toward the path of activity against living cells and its effect on human health is equally important. Till then, control of usage of NP with lower dosedependent concentrations in applications directly in contact with human skin is to be considered for bringing down risk factors to a negligible level."

      "text" : "A current glance at the literature suggests most researches are focused on antimicrobial textile materials based on Ag NP by wet processing, physical reduction, or green synthesis. However, other metal NP such as TiO2, Cu, CuO, and ZnO NP are also effective for fabricating antimicrobial textiles. The size and concentration of the NP plays an important role in demonstrating the strength of the antimicrobial effect with small NP of size 1–15 nm for Ag and Cu NP demonstrating the best activity at >50 ppm concentration (1–2 wt%) . The size of ZnO particles reported was higher, in the range of 30–40 nm but required less concentration (1 wt%) for successful inhibition. The antimicrobial activity of titania NP relying on its photo-catalytic activity provides best results in the presence of UV conditions alone, restricting its applications in the textile industry. Bacterial strains of S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae are the most tested micro-organisms along with the fungal strain of C. albicans. However, most studies lack research on the effect of NP-reinforced textiles on cytotoxicity and allergic reactions to human subjects. A better understanding of NP release from textiles during washing or wear and tear and its subsequent action to the immediate environment is the need of the hour for a successful management of risk factors associated with the application and usage of NP.\nAntimicrobial Textiles Using Nano-particles 97"

Arputharaj, A.K. Bharimalla and P.G. Patil\nICAR-Central Institute for Research on Cotton Technology, Matunga, Mumbai, India\nAbstract Zinc oxide (ZnO), an n-type semiconductor with a band gap of 3.37 eV, is a very interesting multifunctional material having promising applications in solar cells, sensors, displays, gas sensors, varistors, piezoelectric devices, electro-acoustic transducers, photodiodes, and UV light-emitting devices. Other applications include sunscreens, gas sensors, antireflection coatings, and catalysis. ZnO shows both improved quantum yield and tunable excitonic emission energy at nanometer-scale regions. Nanoparticles of zinc oxide (nano-ZnO) score over other nanomaterials for textile applications in terms of cost-effectiveness, transparent nature, and excellent antibacterial and UV-blocking properties. The antibacterial mechanism of nano-ZnO is due to the induction of intercellular reactive oxygen species, disruption of the cell membrane, and oxidative stress, while the UV-blocking property is due to its band gap energy that coincides with that of UV rays. In spite of various advantages, the bottleneck for widespread use in textile finishing is the lack of affinity between textile fibers and nano-ZnO. Conventionally, nano-ZnO is applied onto textiles using binders to hold them on to the surface of fibers. But the wash fastness problem reduced their potency in the due course of time. Our research group extensively worked on both binderbased application and in situ application of nano-ZnO onto cotton textiles. In situ process of nano-ZnO application improved the wash fastness without the use of any binders. The literature reported that the cytotoxicity of nano-ZnO on mouse dermal fibroblast cells depended mainly on the concentration and duration of exposure. The potential toxicity may arise due to the release of zinc ions\n*Corresponding author: Vigneshwaran.N@icar.gov.in\n114 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nthat induces local skin effects (e.g., irritation and contact dermatitis) and absorption of toxic or sensitizing metals.

This distinction allows their potential use in diversified sectors such as medicines, sensors, composites, pulp & paper, and textiles. Many recent reviews are available for synthesis, characterization, and application of nano-ZnO in diversified fields [1–3] and their toxicity attributes [4–6].\nTextiles can provide a suitable substrate for the growth of micro-organisms by providing suitable humidity and temperature in contact to the human body. The recent increase in public concern about hygiene has been driving many research works for the creation of an anti-microbial finish on the surface of textiles. However, using many anti-microbial agents has been avoided because of their possible harmful or toxic effects. The use of inorganic nanoparticles would be a good alternative in comparison with that of traditional harmful/toxic chemicals [7]. Nanomaterials can induce stain repellence, wrinkle-freeness, static elimination, and electrical conductivity to fibers without compromising their comfort and flexibility. Nanomaterials also offer a wider application potential to create connected garments that can sense and respond to external stimuli via electrical, color, or physiological signals [8]."

The generation of hybrid antimicrobial coatings on cotton fabrics by means of a one-step simultaneous sonochemical deposition of nano-ZnO and chitosan was demonstrated to provide an excellent antibacterial activity against the pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli [32].

Since the nano-ZnO has no affinity for the textile substrate, this method is commonly used to achieve the durable effect. Our research group used this method for imparting antibacterial and UV protection activities using the nano-ZnO stabilized by soluble starch [13, 34]. The nano-ZnOimpregnated cotton fabrics showed excellent antibacterial activity against two representative bacteria, S. aureus (Gram positive) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Gram negative). Also, nano-ZnO impregnation enhanced the protection of cotton fabrics against UV radiation in comparison with the untreated cotton fabrics. The nano-ZnO-impregnated fabrics were found to retain more than 80% antibacterial and UV-protection functions even after 25 wash cycles.\nZnO/carboxymethyl chitosan bionano-composite having the mean sizes of ZnO and carboxymethyl chitosan particles, ≈28 nm and ≈100 nm, respectively, were used as a finishing agent for the cotton fabric to impart UV protection and antibacterial properties to cotton fabrics by the paddry-cure method. Thus, finished cotton fabrics exhibited very good antibacterial property against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and also had a good UV protection activity [35].\nThe inorganic–organic hybrid polymers filled with ZnO nano particleschitosan could be prepared through the sol–gel method and applied on the cotton fabric through the pad-dry-cure method [36]. The antimicrobial investigation results against E. coli and M. luteus showed the enhanced antibacterial activity against selected microorganisms. The antibacterial activity of textiles treated by nano-ZnO-chitosan particles increases by decreasing the molecular weight of chitosan as a low molecular weight in the composite improves the movement of chains due to low viscosity. The application of Ag-ZnO nanoparticles on cotton fabrics and cotton– polyester-blended fabrics using the pad-dry-cure method was reported by Ibănescu et al. [37]. The antimicrobial activity of the treated fabric was tested against the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli and Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus. The results showed substantial increase in the antimicrobial property with reasonably good washing durability.\n3.3.3 In Situ Synthesis The synthesis of nanomaterials inside the substrate is an entirely new means of functional finishing onto a textile substrate. Nano-ZnO could be directly synthesized inside the mesopores present on the surface of cotton fibers and the size got restricted by the size of those pores. Hence, the need of stabilizer is nullified. ZnO nanowires have been grown on cotton fabric to impart self-cleaning, superhydrophobicity, and ultraviolet (UV) blocking\n122 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nproperties. ZnO nanowires were grown by the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method and subsequently functionalized with steric acid to obtain a water contact angle of 150°, showing their superhydrophobic nature stable up to four washings. Self-cleaning activity of the ZnO nanowirecoated cotton fabric showed considerable degradation of methylene blue under UV light irradiation [38]. Our research group demonstrated the in situ synthesis of nano-ZnO onto 100% cotton fabrics by the spraying or dipping process resulting in durable antibacterial and UV protection finishes [39]. In this study, the nano-sized pore structure of cellulosic fibrils acted as a nucleation site for the formation of nano-ZnO from the precursors, zinc nitrate, and sodium hydroxide (Figure 3.3). Both the processes resulted in excellent antibacterial activity (>98%) against two representative pathogens, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae even after 50 wash cycles. The UV protection factor (UPF) was maintained above the minimum accepted level of 50+ till 50 wash cycles. The spraying process resulted in three times less uptake of nano-ZnO than that of the dipping process, without significant reduction in functional properties. The water absorbency and color of the terry cotton fabrics remain unaffected in the developed process."

Low-pressure oxygen plasma created by an electrodeless radiofrequency discharge was applied to modify the properties of cellulosic fibers in order to improve adsorption properties toward nano-ZnO and to achieve excellent ultraviolet (UV)-protective properties of the cotton fabric [41]. The results showed that longer plasma treatment time causes higher adsorption of nanoparticles due to the increased concentration of oxygen-containing groups on the fiber surface and because of the increased surface roughness of fibers."

The toxicity due to soluble zinc ions was earlier proved by the use of a microbial sensor [44]. But, the release of zinc ions is affected by various parameters such as size, morphology, and porosity of nano-ZnO; concentration and capping of the nano-ZnO; and pH and chemical nature of the medium where the microbes are present. The complexation of zinc ions by the components of the broth (medium where the microbes are cultivated) increased the solubility of the zinc in the liquid medium, thereby increasing their efficacy [45]."

      "text" : "Though sunlight is very much essential for human health, the ultraviolet (UV) rays in the sunlight pose a major problem to the skin resulting in various skin diseases. Dermatologists warn against excessive sun exposure and focus on the prevention measures such as sun creams and protective clothing. The UV rays from sun undergo various processes as depicted in Figure 3.5. The UV rays can get absorbed, reflected, scattered, transmitted, or re-emitted by fluorescence. Among these various phenomena, the transmitted UV rays could hit our skin inducing the possible damages described above. The UV rays are classified into three regions: UVA – 320 to 400 nm that causes increased aging effects on the skin; UVB – 280 to 320 nm that causes skin burn; and UVC – below 280 nm that causes skin cancer. The parameters that decide the amount of UV rays passing through include the structure of fabric, porosity/density of weave or knit, dye components, wetness, and chemical nature of fibers. The UV protection factor (UPF) states for how long someone wearing UV-protective clothing can stay in the sun without suffering skin damage.\nThree standard documents that pertain to the testing and labeling of UV-protective textile products have been published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC). The titles of these documents\nNano-Zinc Oxide: Prospects in the Textile Industry 127\nare ASTM D 6544 “Standard Practice for the Preparation of Textiles Prior to UV Transmission Testing”, AATCC 183 “Test Method for Transmittance or Blocking of Erythemally Weighted Ultraviolet Radiation Through Fabrics”, and ASTM 6603 “Standard Guide to Labeling of UV-protective Textiles” [48]. The Australian/New Zealand Standard (4399) specifies the Evaluation and Classification of sun-protective clothing. British Standards include BS EN 13758-1 (Textiles. Solar UV protective properties. Method of test for apparel fabrics) and BS EN 13758-2 (Textiles. Solar UV protective properties. Classification and marking of apparel). Determination of the UPF according to UV STANDARD 801 is based on maximum radiation intensity and the sun spectrum in Melbourne/Australia on the 1st of January of a year (i.e., at the height of Australian summer) and the most sensitive skin type for the wearer. As per the International standards, the textiles are classified according to the UPF as given in Table 3.2.\nCotton textiles treated with oxygen low pressure RF plasma for different periods of time and functionalized with 3% of ZnO nanoparticles showed higher adsorption of nanoparticles due to the increased concentration of oxygen-containing groups on the fiber surface and because of the increased surface roughness of fibers. Thus, treated cotton fabrics gained excellent UV protective properties with UPF rating 50+ [41]. ZnO nanostructures (bundle/flower-like particles) homogenously formed on the fibers’ surface of a cotton fabric exhibited the UPF values more than 100 [49]."

The photo-generated holes and electrons can initiate oxidation–reduction reaction, which is able to form the hydroxyl radicals and reactive oxygen\n128 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nspecies that are directly responsible for the oxidative degradation of organic compounds [52]. Figure 3.6 shows the degradation of MB stains by nanoZnO-coated cotton fabrics. The intensities of MB stains on the nano-ZnO fabrics significantly decreased due to the photocatalytic degradation. Also, the photocatalytic degradation properties clearly depended on the concentration of nano-ZnO available on the surface of coated fabric; the rate of photocatalytic degradation increased with the increasing nano-ZnO (from 3 to 9 wt%). Another research team demonstrated the use of nano-ZnO for degradation of both MB and congo red stains by direct in situ growth of vertically aligned one-dimensional nano-ZnO onto textile surfaces [53].\nSynthetic fabrics such as polyester on treatment with nano-ZnO demonstrated excellent antibacterial and self-cleaning effect [54].

In a different approach, Ce-doped nanoZnO prepared via the chemical precipitation method and applied onto the surface of cotton fabrics was demonstrated to impart super hydrophobicity with a contact angle of 148° while that of pure nano-ZnO-treated was 103° [56]. Super-hydrophobic cotton fabrics prepared by fabricating rough surfaces using SiO2 nanoparticles and ZnO nanorod arrays with a subsequent n-dodecyltrimethoxysilane (DTMS) modification showed a water contact\n130 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nangle more than 150°.

      "text" : "Water is a natural gift whose contamination has become a serious problem. There are many sources of water pollution, but the discharge of untreated\n*Corresponding author: mohdkashifchem@gmail.com: m.kashifuddin@mu.edu.sa\n136 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\neffluents from textile dyeing mills into the water bodies is a serious one. Highly concentrated colored wastewater that consists of a mixture of various dyes is highly toxic for living beings. Among the different pollutants of the aquatic ecosystem, dye molecules are highly toxic and mutagenic to both human beings and aquatic species. The molecular structure of dyes contains a complex aromatic ring, which is difficult to decompose and makes them carcinogenic [1, 2]. The discharge of dyes in an aqueous stream poses severe ecological problems to the aquatic life, food web, and to the aesthetic nature of the environment [3]. Dye absorbs and reflects the sunlight by reducing its penetration in water which causes a negative effect on the photosynthesis process, and can interfere in bacterial growth under water [1]. Dye containing wastewater is generally high in both color and organic content. Color is the undesirable physical contaminant, which can be easily recognized and is highly visible in aqueous solution, even in small amount. Organic content is the organic material present in water, which includes both humic and nonhumic fractions. Organic pollutants consist of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, cellulose, fats, lignin, and nucleic acids along with various combinations.\nTextile, finishing, and dye manufacturing industries release a large quantity of wastewater containing toxic dyestuffs into the aquatic systems [4]. Dyes are widely used for coloring products in several industries such as textiles, leather, paper, rubbers, paint, tannery, pharmaceuticals, plastics, foodstuffs, cosmetics, etc. It is estimated that over 700,000 tons of dyes and pigments are produced annually worldwide, 20% of which are utilized for textile dyeing and finishing processes [5]. Textile industries are among the most polluted industries, which discharge wastewater of untreated dyestuffs in large volume and effluent composition [6, 7, 8]. Almost, 1,000 tones/year or more of dyes are discharged into wastewater by the textile industries worldwide [9]. The total dye consumption of the textile industries worldwide is in excess of 107 kg/year [10]. Effluents released from the textile industries are of synthetic origin, which contain a large variety of dyes, additives, pigments, and derivatives. Textile dyes are also potentially more toxic because they are difficult to be treated by the conventional wastewater treatment [11]. The chemical reagents used in textile industries have diversity in their chemical composition, as it ranges from inorganic compounds to polymers and organic products [12]. Dye removal from textile wastewater has been a big challenge over the last few decades. The development of effective methods to remove dyes from industrial wastewater is very important because of the potential toxicity of dyes, and thus is of high demand among the scientific community from the last few years [12].\nIn order to remove these dyes, many physical, chemical, and biological processes such as precipitation, separation, biodegradation,\nDyes Removal by Nanomaterials 137\nphoto-degradation, chemical oxidation, chemical coagulation, foam flotation, reverse osmosis, electrochemical treatment, emulsion, ultrafiltration, photo-catalysis, ion exchange, pre-concentration, evaporation, sedimentation, aerobic or anaerobic treatment, adsorption, etc. have been developed, but most of them suffer from the economic point of view [13]. Out of these methods, the adsorption technique is superior and versatile to eliminate heavy metals from contaminated water because of its low cost, simplicity, ease of operation, efficiency in treatment, good applicability, high capacity, reliability, less energy consumption, and simplicity [14–20]. Adsorption is a mass transfer process by which a substance is transferred from the liquid phase to the surface of a solid, and becomes bound by physical and/ or chemical interactions [15, 16]. In recent years, various nanomaterials have been widely synthesized, and applied in the removal of dyes from the aqueous solution [21]. Continuous development in nanomaterial research is providing effective wastewater treatment technologies to complete fresh water demand of the living beings. However, the need of new treatment methods and updated, reliable, efficient materials is still required to produce high-quality drinking water and to overcome the challenges of providing clean water in adequate amount.\nNanomaterials are of atomic size structure and smaller than 100 nm scale level possessing novel properties, higher surface area-to-volume ratio to offer high reactivity toward environmental contaminants, pollution detection and prevention, and water treatment. Nanoparticles can penetrate deeper and thus can treat wastewater effectively, which is generally not possible by conventional technologies [22]. Nanoparticles can behave as a colloid by mixing with water and they can display quantum-size effects [23–24]. Nanomaterials have been synthesized in various forms such as wires, tubes, films, particles, dots, etc. [25]. Magnetic nanoparticles are also promising because of their chemical structure, binding properties, high efficiency, rapid recovery due to high specific surface area, and low cost. In the treatment of wastewater, many efficient, eco-friendly, and cost-effective nanomaterials have been developed having unique functionalities for potential decontamination of industrial effluents, surface water, ground water, and drinking water [26, 27]. Excellent adsorption results are reported in many studies due to some key features such as high surface area, microporous/mesoporous structure, high dispersion and adsorption ability, and economical and environmentfriendly nature. In this chapter, high adsorption capacity of nanoparticles toward various dyes has been reviewed by analyzing and tabulating the various optimal experimental conditions (solution pH, equilibrium contact time, amount of adsorbent, and temperature) as well as adsorption\n138 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nisotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics data of different nanomaterials toward various types of dyes.

      "heading" : "4.2 Types of Dyes",
      "text" : "Dyes can be classified based on their application and chemical structure. Dye molecules consist of group of atoms known as chromophores and the auxochromes. Chromophores have diverse functional groups responsible for producing color in dye, while the auxochromes intensify the solubility and color of dye. The most common auxochromes are amine, carboxyl, sulfonate, and hydroxyl [28, 29]. There are more than 100,000 commercially available dyes with over 7 × 105 tons of dyestuffs produced annually [1]. There are many structural varieties of dyes, such as acidic, basic, disperse, azo, diazo, and metal complex dyes. These varieties can be divided into cationic, nonionic, or anionic types. Anionic dyes are the direct, acid, and reactive dyes [30]. These are bright in color, water-soluble, and most toxic dyes, as they tend to pass untraced by conventional wastewater treatment [31]. Nonionic dyes are dispersed dyes because they do not ionize in an aqueous medium. Cationic dyes are a kind of alkaline dyes, which can be dissociated into positively charged ions in the aqueous solution and can interact with a negative group to form salt. Cationic dyes are also mostly applied to the dyeing of the polyester fiber and acrylic fiber [32].\nSynthetic dyes are of the following types:\na) Acid dyes – Acid dyes are inexpensive, water-soluble anionic dyes that are applied to fibers such as silk, wool, nylon, and modified acrylic fibers under neutral to acidic conditions. The maximum quantity of acid dye absorbed depends on the amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) present in the solution.\nSO3H\nNN N\nH\n(Acid Yellow 36*) *Source: http://textilelearner.blogspot.in/2015/01/differenttypes-of-dyes-with-chemical.html\nDyes Removal by Nanomaterials 139\nb) Basic dyes – Basic dyes are water-soluble cationic dyes that  are mainly applied to acrylic fibers, coloration of papers, and sometimes to wool and silk. Acetic acid is usually added with basic dyes to increase the uptake of the dye onto the fiber. They give good fastness and bright shades to acrylics.\nH2N\nH2NNH2\nNH2NN NN\n(Basic Brown 1*) *Source: http://textilelearner.blogspot.in/2015/01/differenttypes-of-dyes-with-chemical.html c) Direct dyes – Direct dyes are inexpensive and easy to use, but have poor fastness quality. Direct dyes are applied on cotton, paper, leather, wool, silk, and nylon in a neutral or slightly alkaline dye bath, with the addition of an electrolyte, that is sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) to accelerate the rate of uptake of dye by the fiber.\nSO3NaNaO3S\nH2N\nNH CO HN\nHO OH\nNN NN\n(Direct Dye 26*) *Source: http://textilelearner.blogspot.in/2015/01/differenttypes-of-dyes-with-chemical.html d) Vat dyes – Vat dyes are insoluble in water and incapable of dyeing fibers directly. They can become soluble by the use of a strong reducing agent, such as sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) dissolved in sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The first synthetic vat dye was an indigo created in 1879. The color of denim is due to indigo, the original vat dye. Vat dyes are expensive because of the initial cost as well as the method of application.\n140 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nO\nO\nO\nO\nNH\nHN\n(Vat Blue 4*) *Source: http://textilelearner.blogspot.in/2015/01/differenttypes-of-dyes-with-chemical.html e) Reactive dyes – Reactive dyes are the best one for dyeing cotton and other cellulose fibers. They were first developed in 1956 by I.C.I., U.K. Reactive dyes have excellent fastness properties and areapplied to natural and synthetic cellulosic fibers, natural protein fibers, and polyamide fibers. Reactive dyes are retained onto the fiber by means of a chemical reaction. They have covalent bonds that attach to natural fibers to make them most permanent of dyes.\nN\nN\nN\nCl\nC\nC C\nO\nO NH\nNH2\nNH\nSO3Na\nSO3Na\nSO3Na\n(Reactive blue 5*) *Source: http://textilelearner.blogspot.in/2015/01/differenttypes-of-dyes-with-chemical.html f) Disperse dyes – Disperse dyes are water-insoluble and were originally developed for the dyeing of cellulose acetate. These dyes are finely ground in the presence of a dispersing agent to be sold as a paste, spray-dried, or as a powder. These dyes have very fine particle size that provides a large surface area and high color uptake by the fiber. These are applied to the\nDyes Removal by Nanomaterials 141\nfibers that are most commonly dyed with disperse dyes such as cellulose diacetate, acrylic and nylon fibers, cellulose triacetate, and polyester fibers. Among them, polyester fibers provide satisfactory dyeing results as they are hydrophobic and have a significant crystalline content.\nO\nO\nNH2\nOH\nOCH3\n(Disperse red 4*) *Source: http://textilelearner.blogspot.in/2015/01/differenttypes-of-dyes-with-chemical.html g) Sulfur dyes – Sulfur dyes are inexpensive dyes that are used to dye dark-colored cotton. Natural and man-made cellulosic fibers are used to dye with sulfur dyes. Sulfur Black 1 is the largest selling dye by volume. This type of dye is affected by heating the fabric in an organic compound solution, typically a nitrophenol derivative, and sulfide or polysulfide, which then reacts with the sulfide source to form dark colors that adhere to the fabric.\nO\nO O\nCl Cl\nCl\nN\nN H\nO2N\n(Sulfur red 7*) *Source: http://textilelearner.blogspot.in/2015/01/differenttypes-of-dyes-with-chemical.html h) Azoic colors – Azoic dyeing is a technique in which an insoluble azo dye is produced directly onto or within the fiber. This type of dye can be formed by toxic chemicals and are fast to washing. Azoic colors are used mostly on cotton and nylon. Azoic colors give bright and high intensity colors, in comparison to common dyes.\n142 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles"

CNTs were prepared via the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and functionalized using a mixture of concentrated acids, while NiFe2O4– CNTs were prepared by in situ chemical precipitation of metal hydroxides followed by hydrothermal processing. It was found in the kinetics study of this research that the pseudo-second-order model controlled the adsorption of methyl green onto CNTs, while it was the pseudo-first-order model for the adsorption onto NiFe2O4–CNTs. The linear correlation coefficients (R2), equilibrium adsorption data, standard deviations of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, and other results of the study showed that CNTs and NiFe2O4–MWCNTs were efficient adsorbents for the removal of methyl green from wastewater.\nZhang et al. [64] claimed to achieve the highest adsorption capacity among various reported adsorbents in removing methyl blue (MB) by zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles. The adsorption process of MB on ZnO nanoparticles was found to be selective and independent of temperature and pH in its experimental range. The adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo-second-order model and exhibited a two-stage intra-particle diffusion model. The Temkin isotherm model indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous and uniformly distributed. However, the adsorption isotherm was only calculated and fitted well with the Temkin isotherm, but the parameters of other main and important isotherms such as Langmuir and Freundlich were not calculated in this study.\nIn search of a cost-effective and environment-friendly material for adsorption of toxic crystal violet dye, green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using soil was carried as a novel nanocomposite [35]. In comparison with soil under same experimental conditions, this nanocomposite was found to have a higher adsorption capacity toward the crystal violet dye. The percentage dye removal was homogenous, spontaneous, and endothermic, suggesting that the used nano-adsorbent was efficient in removing crystal violet from the effluent solution.\nZinc–aluminum-layered double hydroxide (Zn–Al LDH), an innovative nano-structured inorganic adsorbent, was synthesized for the separation of reactive yellow 84 (RY84) dye from several textile wastewater effluents. The study also revealed that the coupling of Zn–Al(NO3\n-) LDH nano-adsorbent for a solid phase extraction (SPE) procedure with spectrophotometric detection exhibited a simple and low-cost technique that can be used for the determination of RY84 dye [65].\nZeolite particles functionalized with graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets and a carboxylated diazonium salt (4-carboxybenzenediazoniumtetrafluoroborate) and were applied as effective and environmentally favorable\nDyes Removal by Nanomaterials 147\nadsorbents to remove cationic dye, rhodamine B, from aqueous solution [36]. Results of this study indicated that benzene carboxylic acid derivatized GO-zeolite powders showed higher adsorption capacities compared to pristine natural zeolite and GO-coated zeolite powders.\nSimply made and cost-effective nano-alumina were found to be quite efficient for the removal of reactive red (RR) 120 dye (C44H24C12N14O20S6Na6) from the aqueous solution [40]. It was found in this study that with an increase of the adsorbent dose, the dye removal efficiency increased, while the amount of dye adsorbed per unit mass (mg/g) decreased.\nThe deposition–precipitation method was used to synthesize and develop nano-graphite/Fe3O4 composite (NG/FC) for the removal of methyl violet (MV) from aqueous solution [41]. The Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model fitted the experimental data quite well. High stability and remarkable regeneration ability indicated that the NG/FC composite was a promising adsorbent for the removal of MV from wastewater.\nChi et al. [42] explored the potential environmental engineering application of silica colloid–polyelectrolyte–iron oxide nanocomposite. The magnetic and catalytic properties of the nanocomposite were synthesized via layer-by-layer assembly to adsorb organic dyes, methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO), from aqueous environment. The electrostatic interactions between the dyes and as-synthesized nanomaterials verified that silica colloid–polyelectrolyte–iron oxide composite was a superior adsorbent due to its catalytic properties. 100% dye removal efficiency was recorded on silica–PDDA–IOMNPs nanocomposite neglecting the charge of dye involved. This nanocomposite can be repeatedly used for at least five times for the water treatment purpose that made it a versatile nanoagent for environmental engineering application. The adsorption isotherm data for silica–PDDA–IOMNPs nanocomposite in MO and MB removal were well fitted with the Langmuir model suggesting that the adsorption occurred with monolayer coverage. Dye interaction on the adsorption process and the catalytic degradation mechanism by Fenton and Fenton-like reaction were described appropriately by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model.\nAn alumina nanoparticle was developed using the combustion synthesis method and was utilized as an adsorbent for the removal color black G (CBG) from wastewater [43]. It was noted that the maximum adsorption of CBG was obtained at a pH value of 2. The kinetic data obtained during the experiments are better fitted with the pseudo-first-order model for CBG (R2 = 0.971). The Langmuir isotherm model described the phenomenon for the removal of CBG using the alumina nanoparticles well. The Microsoft solver technique was used to obtain the optimum values of\n148 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\ninitial concentration, pH, contact time, and adsorbent dosage for maximum adsorption capacity.\nA low-temperature hydrothermal route has been successfully developed to synthesize multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) at 190 °C with catalyst Pd by using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the carbon source [44]. The adsorption property of maxilon blue (GRL) from aqueous solution onto MWCNTs was studied by batch experiments as a function of mass dosage, pH of solution, initial dye concentration, and temperature. Equilibrium isotherm data were tested using Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin models. Among them, the Freundlich equilibrium isotherm fitted well the experimental data, indicating the homogeneity of the adsorbent surface sites. The adsorption of GRL dye onto MWCNTs was a spontaneous and endothermic process, which indicated that the adsorption was favored at high temperature.\nA Fe2O3–biochar nanocomposite (Fe2O3–BC) was prepared from FeCl3impregnated pulp and paper sludge (PPS) by pyrolysis at 750 °C to be used as an adsorbent for the treatment of methyl orange (MO)-containing wastewater [45]. The study also reported the comparison between the adsorption capacities of Fe2O3–BC with unactivated biochar (BC). MO adsorption followed pseudo-second-order kinetics for both BC and Fe2O3–BC with R2 values of 0.996 and 0.999, respectively. Gibbs free energy calculations confirmed the adsorption was energetically favorable and spontaneous with a high preference for adsorption on both adsorbents. The hybrid nature of the nanocomposites was responsible for the efficient removal of MO (97%) from contaminated wastewater. However, regeneration capacity of the adsorbents and the effect of competition on the adsorption of different dyes still need to be investigated.\nAnother novel nano-zerovalent iron S. swartzii (nZVI-SS) biocomposite was synthesized for the removal of malachite green (MG) from polluted wastewater [66]. The column experimental data obtained at different conditions were analyzed using three different models, namely, Adam–Bohart model, Thomas model, and Yoon–Nelson model, which provided a good breakthrough curve prediction. However, the results obtained from the Thomas model and the Yoon–Nelson model were more satisfactory. The packed bed investigation on the biosorption of MG onto nZVI-SS biocomposite revealed the importance of bed height, flow rate, and inlet solute concentration on MG biosorption. The increase in bed height resulted in the extension of the breakthrough time, whereas increase in flow rate down-regulated the breakthrough time.\nCarbon-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4@CNPs) were synthesized by using ultra small citrus pectin as the carbon source with an average size of 7 nm and a specific surface area up to 58.72 m2 g−1 to remove methylene\nDyes Removal by Nanomaterials 149\nblue from contaminated water samples. It was concluded that the synthesized Fe3O4@CNPs had great potential for methylene blue removal from wastewater. Citrus pectin was efficiently utilized in this study [48].\nIn another study, a new type of porous silica microspheres was successfully synthesized by a modified two-step sol-emulsion-gel method, which offered fast and efficient synthesis of the porous bimodal silica particles. These bimodal meso/macro-porous silica microspheres (MSM) were then coated with polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles of 39 nm in size. The high specific surface area (612.3 m2 g 1), fast mass transfer (0.9–2.67 10 3 mL min 1 mg) of synthesized adsorbent, and abundant functional groups of PDA were the main reasons for the high removal of methylene blue (MB) from the aqueous solution. The MB adsorption was highly dependent on solution pH, influent MB concentration, and flow rate of MB solution. Maximum adsorption capacity could reach up to 83.8 mg g 1 at pH 10, which was larger than that of most of other reported adsorbents. Thomas and Adams–Bohart models showed a good agreement with the experimental data. The regeneration process was conducted using 0.1 M HCl solution and the regenerated adsorbent could be reused for the adsorption process successfully [49].\nMagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles coated with κ-carrageenan/silica organic/inorganic hybrid shells were synthesized and used as novel adsorbents for the magnetically assisted removal of methylene blue (MB) from water [50]. These hybrid materials were enriched with ester sulfate groups due to extensive grafting of κ-carrageenan over the siliceous domains by using a new surface modification method. The MB removal efficiency over six consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles was above 97%, which demonstrated the reusability potential of these hybrid sorbents.\nHighly efficient and environmentally benign clay mineral, Fe(III)–montmorillonite [Fe(III)–Mt], was explored for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) dye from the aqueous solution [67]. The Fe(III)–Mt was interacted with the MB dye solution at different pH, temperature, and solid-to-liquid ratio. The MB dye removal was rapid at basic pH and increased with temperature up to 40 °C. A complete reduction (100%) was occurred in about 7 min at pH 7 and 10 while at pH 3 in about 10 min. This study revealed that Fe(III)–Mt had the potential to be used as an adsorbent to remove cationic pollutants effectively and rapidly from industrial wastewater.\nThe CuO and NiO nano-flakes were synthesized by a hydrothermal reaction and used as a potential adsorbent for malachite green oxalate (MGO) and methyl orange (MO) (51). XRD, SEM, and TEM characterized the structure, morphology, and surface properties of the nanoparticles. The adsorption of MGO increased with an increase in the pH, while\n150 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles"

      "text" : "Three MgO nanomaterials (MgOS, MgON, and MgOU) were synthesized by sol–gel and two different precipitation methods, respectively, and used for the sorption of remazol red (RB-133) dye from the aqueous solution. The complete removal efficiency of the dye on MgOS, MgON, and MgOU adsorbents was attained in less time of 11, 40, and 60 min, respectively. Hence, the MgOS adsorbent was found to possess the highest removal efficiency of the dye from aqueous solutions. The Langmuir isotherm model was found suitable to describe adsorption, while the dye adsorption followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. Evaluation of thermodynamic parameters revealed that the adsorption process was exothermic and spontaneous. The results showed that potentially lowering capital and operational costs of MgOs adsorbent was a promising one for the removal of synthetic dye in wastewater treatment [52].\nThe efficiency of an organo-palygorskite-Fe3O4 nanomaterial was recently investigated in the removal of two anionic dyes, methyl orange and indigo carmine, from aqueous solution [68]. The production of palygorskite-Fe3O4 nanoparticles organophilized with cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was proven by different characterizations. The adsorbed anionic dye on organo-palygorskite-Fe3O4 might be completely recovered by the action of a magnet, showing an excellent adsorptive property. The negative values calculated for the free energies of adsorption indicated that the adsorption of methyl orange and indigo carmine on the active sites of organo-palygorskite-Fe3O4 surface was spontaneous.\nOrange G (OG), an anionic dye, was removed from aqueous solutions by the application of alumina nanoparticles [53]. Alumina nanoparticles were successfully synthesized via the sol–gel technique and the particle size was found to be in the range of 30–35 nm. The formation of nanoscale alumina particles was analyzed by the TEM and SEM techniques. The effect of various important parameters on dye removal was examined in this study and it was found that adsorption was highly pH dependent and a maximum removal of 98.4% was observed at pH 2.5. The mechanism of the adsorption process was also interpreted with the help of diffusion models. The Weber–Morris and diffusion models depicted that the mechanism of the removal process was controlled by both the film and pore diffusion but external diffusion controlled the overall rate of the sorption process.\nCobalt ferrite nanoparticles (CFO NPs) were synthesized by a facile and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-assisted hydrothermal method [69]. The as-synthesized samples showed highly selective adsorption characteristics\nDyes Removal by Nanomaterials 151\nfor organic dyes: methyl orange (MO) and methyl blue (MB), Congo red (CR). PEG/CoFe2O4 nanocomposites had higher adsorption properties for congo red dye, in comparison to methyl orange and methyl blue. This study confirmed that CFO NPs were an excellent selective adsorbent to remove organic dyes from wastewater.\nDifferent types of cationic dyes: methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RB), and anionic dyes: methyl orange (MO) and eosin Y (EY), were removed from aqueous solutions using Cu2Se nanoparticles (Cu2SeNPs) by the adsorption method in a study [54]. The driving force for the adsorption of dyes had electrostatic and π–π interactions between Cu2SeNPs and dyes. Cu2SeNPs showed great potential as an adsorbent for dyes removal due to its good stability, functionalization, and reusability. Furthermore, Cu2SeNPs can be recycled from selenium nanoparticles adsorbing copper.\nSuperparamagnetic rGO-Co3O4 nanocomposite removed rhodamine B, methyl orange, and rose Bengal (5–15 lM) in less than 1 min at neutral pH from polluted water [70]. The magnetic properties of the nanocomposite allowed simple separation from the liquid phase by application of an external magnet (1T). The results of the study evidenced that rGO-Co3O4 had potential capability for the removal of heavy metal ions and organic dyes from wastewater and other catalytic transformations in the field of environmental remediation.\nThe surface of magnetite nanoparticle-loaded fig leaves (MNLFL) and magnetite nanoparticle-loaded Azolla (MNLA) was utilized as natural cheap sources of adsorbents to adsorb cationic dyes: crystal violet and methylene blue. The kinetic studies of adsorption were tested for pseudofirst-order, pseudo-second-order, intraparticle diffusion, and Elovich models. At optimum conditions, a pseudo-second-order kinetic model best described the adsorption of the crystal violet and methylene blue on the surface of MNLFL and MNLA adsorbents. The Langmuir isotherm fitted more than the Freundlich and Temkin isotherm in equilibrium data [55].\nA two-step process utilizing surface modification of gas-phase-synthesized iron-oxide nanoparticles and a subsequent polymerization process synthesized a new type of porous iron-oxide/polymer nanocomposite [57]. Iron-oxide/polymer composite adsorbent with a large surface area was tested for the removal of methylene blue (MB). The super-paramagnetic properties of the nanocomposite adsorbent allowed its easy separation from water by a simple magnet, which enabled the development of a clean and safe process for water pollution remediation. This work contributed toward the development of easy handling and environment-friendly adsorbent and adsorption process, as the novel mesoporous magnetic\n152 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\niron-oxide/polymer adsorbent was a promising low-cost adsorbent for the large-scale removal of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions.\nGraphene oxide/magnesium oxide nanocomposites (GO/MgO NCs) were synthesized by the formation of chemical bonding between MgO and GO, and applied as an adsorbent for the removal of MB from the aqueous solution [71]. The prepared hybrid composite materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrum, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The results revealed that electrostatic attraction could be the dominant mechanism of adsorption between GO/MgO NCs and MB for pH above pHpzc, whereas for pH below pHpzc, other adsorption mechanisms such as hydrogen bonding and π–π interaction might attribute to adsorption. The high adsorption capacity of GO/MgO composites made it a promising adsorbent for water and wastewater treatment.\nDyes Removal by Nanomaterials 153\nNew types of antimicrobial capped ZnO nanoparticles were prepared recently at low temperature in water without calcination using PIL based on a PAMPSA/VP copolymer [72]. Crosslinked 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid-co-acrylonitrile nanocomposites were then prepared by ZnO nanoparticles to apply as an adsorbent for the removal of a harmful organic pollutant: ethylene blue dye. The ZnO composites achieved high adsorption removal rate for 3000 mg/L of MB from water during 20 min.\nThe adsorption and kinetic studies were carried out on three textile dyes, namely Reactive Blue 222 (RB 222), Reactive Red 195 (RR 195), and Reactive Yellow145 (RY 145) using PRO-BEN [a bentonite modified with a new cationic proline polymer (L-prolineepichlorohydrin polymer)] in a study [73]. A higher concentration of dyes had increased the adsorption efficiency, while the increase in pH, salt content, and the temperature had a negative effect on adsorption. The adsorption process was exothermic and spontaneous. The second-order kinetic model had proved to describe the rate of adsorption for the range of initial concentrations. The mechanism of adsorption followed intraparticle diffusion as well as external mass transfer, indicating that PRO-BEN was effective in adsorbing anionic dyes, and could be employed as an industrial solution to effluent remediation.\nFe3O4/Poly(styrene-co-methacrylic acid) (St-co-MAA) particles with different particle sizes (20 and 255 nm) were synthesized by mini emulsion polymerization via two routes and used as adsorbents for the removal of crystal violet (CV) and Rhodamine B (RB) from the water solution. The effects of various factors on the adsorption capacity, such as contact time, pH of dyes solution, and initial dyes concentration were investigated. Adsorption kinetics of Fe3O4/Poly(St-co-MAA) were well explained by the pseudo-second-order model, suggesting a chemical adsorption process. The dye-adsorbed magnetic Poly(St-co-MAA) could be easily desorbed and reused for at least four cycles with a little decrease in adsorption capacity [61].\nTable 4.2 comprises the kinetics and thermodynamics adsorption parameters, and Figure 4.2 shows the pictorial diagram of the chapter."

The performance adsorption process in the reported studies has been checked by examining the effect of various factors such as pH, contact time, initial influent concentration, temperature, adsorbent dosage, etc. To determine the adsorption rate and adsorption efficiency of nanomaterials in removing toxic dye effluents from water and wastewater, various parameters such as adsorption isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics have been demonstrated. Desorption and regeneration studies are important factors and thus implied by various researchers in the reported studies to determine the application, recovery, and reuse of nano-adsorbents. To characterize the nanomaterials, several instrumentation methods were used such as FTIR, SEM, TEM, XRD, TGA, etc. in almost all the reported studies. It can be concluded that the use of nanotechnology to address water problems is the promising application to solve technical problems in removing water pollutants. Nanomaterials are of increased interest for research and development around the globe based on their capacity for selective adsorption of dye molecules from aqueous solution to solve water problems."

      "text" : "Discharging of dyes and metal ion containing effluents of various industries into water bodies has become the main cause of water pollution [1]. These effluents change the taste, odor, and property of water, which create a significantly bad impact to the life of aquatic flora and fauna [2]. Dyebased industries including printing, paper making, textile, and the paint industry are widely facing the problem of dye-contaminated wastewater [3]. Among the contaminated pollutants in industrial effluents, dyes are the most harmful substances which hinder penetration of sunlight into water and prohibit the photosynthesis of aquatic animals. In addition, these dye molecules affect the quality of water and result in carcinogenic influence [4]. Industrialization and urbanization have increased the discharging of metal ions, which include aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), and mercury (Hg) in soil, air, and water, which severely harm the environment [5–7]. These metal ions are consumed by the human through food or water, adsorbed in the body, and play a key role during cellular activity up to a certain limit [8–12]. The metal ions can be beneficial only up to a certain concentration. However, a higher concentration causes a number of physiological effects. Various metal ions together with their permissible limits according to the World Health Organization (WHO) are shown in Table 5.1.\nBesides dyes and metal ions, other organic entities including insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, wood preservatives, and the use of antibiotics are also highly toxic, and affect body’s soft tissues and cause a number of diseases (e.g., gastrointestinal, carcinogenicity, etc.) [22–26]. Therefore, it is important to treat industrial effluents and solid wastes before discharging into water resources. In this regard, a number of chemical and biological treatment methods (e.g., flotation, chemical precipitation, electro-coagulation-flocculation, membrane filtration, ion exchange, modified bentonite clay, natural adsorbent, etc.) are used [6, 27–38]. These methods\nChitosan–Graphene-Grafted Nanocomposite Materials 165\nare associated with high-cost, time-consuming, pre-treatment procedures as well as are inconvenient for onsite analyses. As compared to conventional methods, adsorption by hybrid ion-exchange materials has gained popularity and is being effectively used for the removal of dyes and metal ions [11, 39–41]. However, there are certain drawbacks [42]. The limitations of composite materials have been overcome by the synthesis of chitosan–graphene-grafted nanocomposite adsorbents for the treatment of wastewaters."

      "text" : "Recently, various methods and techniques have been developed to fabricate cost-effective polysaccharide adsorbents namely starch, cellulose, alginate, and chitosan [43]. Chitosan (Ch) is a low-cost, non-toxic, highly reactive multifunctional biomaterial which is obtained by the deacetylation of chitin [44] and shows higher adsorption efficiency owing to the existence of a large number of amino groups [45]. It has been successfully applied in\n166 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\na number of fields such as the food industry, cosmetic, medicine, water treatment, etc. The presence of amine and hydroxyl groups makes the Ch as a potential biosorbent for the removal of metal ions in wastewaters due to the formation of stable metal chelates [46]. Chitosan is also associated with some limitations as it is soluble in the acidic medium except water and alkaline solutions. To improve mechanical strength and adsorption efficiency of Ch for the treatment of metal ions in aqueous media, efforts have been made to modify Ch with a suitable adsorbent [47]. In this regard, a new member of the carbon family, graphene (Gr), was selected for the modification of Ch owing to its unique structure (two-dimensional, oneatom-thick structure) together with high mechanical properties and high surface area [48]. One of the particular derivatives of graphene is known as graphene oxide (GO), which has attracted much attention for the adsorption of metal ions, dyes and other uses [49]. The GO consisting of various functional groups (–OH, –OOH, –COOH), which provide interfacial interaction with other adsorbent to synthesize thermally and chemically stable products as well as to improve other properties (hydrophilicity). In addition, these functional groups show strong binding affinity with metal ions and dyes molecules [49, 50]. The GO has been successfully applied in the form of effective adsorbent for the removal of metal ions (Cd(II), Co(II), and Cu(II)) from water [50, 51]. The GO-based membrane was developed using green-induced directional method [52]. The membrane was employed for the adsorption of Cu(II), Ni(II), and Cd(II) ions. The adsorption of metal ions on GO membranes was interrupted by weak ionic strength. Maximum adsorption of Cu(II), Ni(II), and Cd(II) on membrane was found to be 72.6, 83.8, and 62.3 mg g 1, respectively. Adsorption isotherm followed the Langmuir isotherm model and adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model for the adsorption of metal ions. It has been noticed that the adsorption process reached equilibrium in a shorter period of time due to larger interlayer spacing of GO membranes. Based on recycling and regeneration study, the prepared GO membranes can be used more than six times without decline in adsorption capacity.\nYang et al. in 2010 demonstrated the interaction between positively charged ions on Cu(II) and negatively charged GO. It was able to remove Cu(II) ions [53–55]. The results have proved that GO can also be used for the adsorption of Pb(II), Cd(II), Co(II), and U(VI). However, it is noteworthy to mention that pH is an important factor in the adsorption of heavy metals using GO because the pH-dependent functional groups on the GO surface are the potential sites for metal adsorption. Zhang et al. reported the treatment of arsenate with 95% removal efficiency within 4–7 pH range using a cross-linked ferric hydroxide–GO composite [56]. The fabrication\nChitosan–Graphene-Grafted Nanocomposite Materials 167\nof composite was done by in situ oxidation of ferrous sulfate using hydrogen peroxide.\nA recent study carried out by Zhu et al. indicated efficient adsorption of As(III) from contaminated water via Fe–Fe2O3 core shell coated with graphene [57]. Fe2O3 helps to increase adsorption sites whereas Fe core maintains the magnetic separation. This finding was explored by Luo et al. who observed that pH plays an important role for the adsorption of metal ions. The increase in the pH range improves the adsorption rate of MnO2 nanoparticles into Fe3O4–rGO materials. Therefore, MnO2 functions as a good oxidant for the effective adsorption of As(III) and As(V). There is a great application potential foreseen. The removal of Cr(VI) from polluted waters by catalytic reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) using iron-decorated grapheme sheets was reported by Humera et al. [58].\nIn another study, Zhu et al. [59] synthesized graphene-coated core double-shell nanoparticles for the removal of Cr(VI) from wastewater. This core was made up of crystalline iron while the outer shell was made up of iron oxide. The external shell covered an amorphous Si–S–O. Results indicated total removal of Cr(VI) in 5 min which could be separated from the solution using an external magnetic field. Metal ion induced self-assembly of a FeOOH–rGO hydrogel by the NH4OH reduction of FeSO4 and GO was fabricated by Cong et al. [60]. This composite proved to be effective in the removal of gasoline, Cr(VI), and Pb(II) from polluted water. Similarly, Sreeprasad et al. synthesized rGO–metal/metal oxide composites using a redox-like reaction between GO and the metal precursors, which resulted in the effective removal of Hg(II) from polluted water [61]. In the same vain, GO coated with TiO2 can be used in the removal of the heavy metal ions; Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II) [61]. In order to increase the adsorption capacity of graphene, Polypyrrole–rGO hybrid was synthesized via a noncovalent functionalization of graphene sheets with polypyrrole [62]. The outcome indicated the growth of polypyrrole on the graphene sheets resulting in high surface area of mesoporous nature. The adsorption capacity is also affected by the ionic strength as it determines the concentration of heavy metal ions available for adsorption. 3D materials have also been applied in the adsorption of metal contaminants from polluted water [73]. This work was further extended by Li et al. [63] who revealed that polypyrrole–rGO nanosheets could be used in the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions. Sacrificial MnO2 nanoslices served as the composite material, with the polypyrrole retaining the morphology of the MnO2 nanostructure. As with 3D graphene materials, these polypyrrole materials show an increased adsorption capacity due to a change in the structure of composite material. Vasudevan and Lakshmi [64] proved that graphene\n168 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\ncan be applied for the effective removal of phosphate ions from aqueous solutions. In this study, graphene was prepared by liquid phase exfoliation of graphite. This process establishes functional groups onto the graphene surfaces, which are vital for the phosphate adsorption. The authors concluded that this adsorption is spontaneous and chemically irreversible, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 89.4 mg g 1. Correspondingly, Li et al. [65] have shown that exfoliated graphene can be used to adsorb fluoride ions (monolayer adsorption capacity 35.6 mg g 1 at pH 7 and 298 K) from the solution. The results reveal that it cannot be effectively employed in industrial settings even though it has proven to be an effective adsorbent due to its irreversibility.\nThus, GO membranes have been effectively employed for the removal of heavy and toxic metal ions. However, self-association and van der wall interaction between GO layers inhibit their use in potential application [66]. To overcome all the drawbacks associated with native Ch and GO, chitosan–graphene-supported nanocomposite materials were synthesized using different chemical routes. The present chapter deals with the synthesis of chitosan–graphene-grafted nanocomposite materials and their application for the removal of metal ions and dyes from wastewaters."

      "text" : "Graphene oxide/chitosan (GO-Ch)-supported nanocomposite was fabricated for the removal of Cr(VI) ions [66]. The composite material was synthesized by the reaction of GO and Ch modified with disodium ethylene-diaminetetraacetate (EDTA-2Na) (GCE). In terms of adsorption capacity, GO-Ch-modified showed much more adsorption efficiency: 86.17 mg/g for Cr(VI) at pH 2 compared to unmodified Ch and established equilibrium in a short time (90 min). Interestingly, adsorption kinetics study covered a pseudo-second-order model together with intraparticle diffusion and film diffusion models. In between the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, the adsorption process was found to be best fitted for the Freundlich isotherm and demonstrated high value for the Freundlich constant (KF) which increased with increasing temperature leading to higher adsorption. Thermodynamics studies were spontaneous and highly endothermic nature at high temperature for the adsorption of Cr(VI) on GEC. The re-generation study confirmed the reusability of\nChitosan–Graphene-Grafted Nanocomposite Materials 169\nthe GEC nanocomposite, which showed only 5% reduction in the adsorption efficiency after seven cycles. Thus, a higher adsorption capacity along with good re-generability of GEC makes the GEC a potential material for the removal of Cr(VI) ions in contaminated water. A comparative study regarding the adsorption behavior of GEC for the removal of Cr(VI) with other reported adsorbent is shown in Table 5.2.\nA novel nanocomposite was synthesized by the implementation of amino-functionalized magnetic composite, CoFe2O4/chitosan/graphene [75]. Various characterization techniques including FTIR, XRD, and BET were employed to investigate morphology and chemical makeup of the composite. In addition, the effect of adsorption dose, pH, and contact time was determined to examine adsorption behavior of the composite. The optimal adsorption capacity of Ch-GO was found to be 361.0 mg/g at 323 K at neutral pH (7.0). Adsorption kinetics was established by the pseudo-first-order equation with a higher value of R2 (0.9976) as compared to pseudo-second-order kinetics. Adsorption isotherms were also studied at different temperatures, which confirmed the Langmuir isotherm model. The thermodynamic study revealed a spontaneous and endothermic nature of the adsorption process [76]. The synthesized nanocomposite of CoFe2O4/chitosan/graphene successfully reduced Hg(II) ions from the wastewater sample.\n170 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nTo improve the quality of wastewater, a hybrid of reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/chitosan/lysine (Ch) with PLL was developed using electropolymerization and cyclic voltammetry [77]. The pH of the solution plays an important role for the adsorption of metal ions in optimum yield; therefore, the optimal pH-4.5 was chosen due to protonation of hydrophilic groups that result in reduction in the metal ion adsorption. The synthesized electrode was effectively applied for the removal and recovery of Cd(II): 96.0–103.33%, Pb(II): 93.33–97.6%, and Cu(II): 96.66–101.33% in a tap water sample.\nTriehtylenetetramine-based graphene oxide and chitosan (TGO-Ch) composites were developed by microwave irradiation and conventional heating method [78]. The adsorption of Cr(VI) was compared using both the above-mentioned methods. However, microwave irradiation resulted in higher yield. Optimal capacity of Cr(VI) was achieved (219.5 mg g 1) at pH 2 with 20 mg RGO-Ch (303 K). The adsorption kinetics followed pseudosecond-order kinetics and quick equilibrium adsorption (85%) was achieved in 20 min. A thermodynamic study established an endothermic and spontaneous process. The recycling study was performed to reuse the exhausted material after the adsorption process. The solvents, HCl and NaOH, were employed to desorb adsorbed Cr(VI) on TGO-Ch. The material showed 92.25% and 82.82% removal efficiency by using NaOH (1  mol  L−1) after three cycles; however, 80% removal capacity was archived after five cycles which confirmed the effective removal of Cr(VI) in waste water.\nAnother chitosan coating attapulgite (Ch-ATP) has been fabricated by self-assembly methodology and applied for the treatment of U(VI) in waste solutions [79]. In comparison to ATP and pure chitosan, modified Ch-ATP showed improved adsorption capacity of U(VI). Batch adsorption study and spectroscopic analyses confirmed the formation of inner-sphere complexes of U(VI) on the surface of Ch-ATP owing to the bonding of newly generated functional groups (i.e., -OH and -COOH). Under acidic conditions, the composite material revealed improvement in the adsorption of U(VI) in the presence of humic substances (HS); however, the alkaline medium restricted its adsorption capacity (desorption). The coordination of U(VI) with O2−  and –OH groups of Ch-ATP was confirmed by XPS analysis. It was observed that after sorption of uranium, the existence of specific band at ~382 eV verified high sorption capacity of Ch-ATP. Based on good adsorption capacity, eco-friendly and cost-efficient Ch-ATP can be effectively applied for the pre-concentration of U(VI) in contaminated water and nuclear reactor discharges.\nChandra et al. have synthesized magnetite-reduced graphene (MRGO) nanocomposites for the removal of arsenic in wastewater [80].\nChitosan–Graphene-Grafted Nanocomposite Materials 171\nMorphological investigation of the composite was done by FTIR and XRD techniques. The magnetic MRGO demonstrated superior paramagnetic behavior at room temperature and might be separated by an external magnetic flux. These composites show high binding capability toward As(III) and As(V) due to the formation of active or sorption sites in the matrix of reduced graphene. The composite material showed 99.9% arsenic removal efficiency in water.\nMercapto-grafted graphene oxide–magnetic chitosan (MC-GOCh) bio absorbent has been formulated for the pre-concentration and extraction of Hg(II) using a facile eco-friendly method [81]. Cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy was used for the detection of Hg(II). Maximum adsorption of mercury was achieved under optimal conditions of sorbent dose of 60 mg at pH 6.5 and surface assimilation time of 10 min by using 3 mL HCl (0.1M) and thiourea (2% w/v) for a breakthrough curve. An exceptional linear curve was obtained in 0.12–80  ng  mL−1  range (R2  =  0.999) together with a pre-concentration factor (80). The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were found to be 6.0 × 10 2 ng mL 1 and 12.0 × 10 2 ng mL 1, respectively. The value of relative standard deviation (4.7%) demonstrated good repeatability together with good recoveries (95 to 100%) of metal ions Hg(II) in real water.\nA porous hybrid chitosan–gelatin/graphene oxide (ChG-GO) nanocomposite has been used for the removal of metal ions with significant recoveries (97%) [82]. The material was prepared by unidirectional freezedrying method and characterized using advanced techniques. Highly porous nature of ChG-GO was found owing to the development of new cavity in the matrix of a composite and the material showed selectivity for the detection of Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions. Physico-chemical parameters such as wet ability, absorption capacity, compressive strength, the effect of pH, concentration of GO, and metal ion along with the effect of EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) were determined for the optimal absorption of metal ions on the composite material. The improvement in absorption efficiency of ChG-GO was achieved (1700% to 2700%) by the enhancement in the content of GO (1% by wt.) in the matrix of monolith which increased porosity and surface area and resulted in higher adsorption capacity. The compressive strength composite monoliths increases with enhancing the content of GO in both states (dry and wet), which proved a strong interaction between the polymer matrix of chitosan and GO sheets. The composite material containing 5% GO showed higher (2.5 times) compressive strength as compared to 1% GO by weight. The adsorption efficiency of water increases due to the improvement in functional groups ( OH,\nCOOH) on the surface of ChG-GO composite and results in higher\n172 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nadsorption of metal ions. The adsorption efficiency (Qs) of Pb(II) increases (68.5 to 99 mg/g) with the increasing content of GO (5 wt. %) in the ChG matrix. Moreover, 20% to 88% increment in the adsorption capacity of Pb(II) was found by the addition of EDTA. The ChG-GO nanocomposite showed 80% adsorption capacity after five desorption cycles which confirmed its ability for the treatment of metal ions.\nLi et al. fabricated graphene-supported cyclodextrin-chitosan/graphene oxide nanocomposite (cycledex-Ch-GO) using a facile chemical route. The synthesized grafted nanocomposite has been used for the adsorption of Cr(VI) in an aqueous solution [83]. The magnetic property of cyclodexCh-GO was found due to the reaction of Fe3O4 with cyclodex-Ch-GO. Based on a high surface area, existence of –OH and –NH2 groups, the material has high potential to extract Cr(VI) from water under the influence of a magnetic field. The adsorption of Cr (VI) ions was followed by the Langmuir isotherm together with a maximum removal capacity of Cr(VI) at low pH (6.8) while chemical kinetics was followed by pseudo-secondorder kinetics. High performance of cyclodex-Ch-GO was due to its high surface area which caused optimal removal of Cr(VI) in wastewater.\nAn interesting work related to the removal of Cd(II), methylene blue (MB), and orange G (OG) using magnetic graphene oxide (MGO) nanocomposite has been reported by Deng et al. [84]. The pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir isotherm model were found to be best fitted for maximum adsorption of Cd(II) (91.2 mg g 1), MB (64.23 mg g 1), and OG (20.85 mg g 1), respectively. The synthesized nanocomposites were also utilized for the removal of dyes from real water samples. It has been observed that in tap water samples, the natural process capability of Cd(II) was 65.39% from ultrapure water. However, the water samples had very little interference with the performance of MGO toward MB and OG, indicating that MGO was appropriated for the removal of ionic dyes as well as Cd (II) from real water. On increasing the concentration of MB, the adsorption capacity of Cd(II) was found to decrease. The GO showed a reversible trend (improvement in adsorption efficiency) in the binary systems of Cd(II)– MB and Cd(II)–OG, respectively. Therefore, there might be chances of interference of MB and OG with an MGO composite which demonstrated improved removal potential of dye molecules in water samples.\nA hybrid of Fe3O4 SiO2-chitosan/GO (MS-Ch-GO) nanocomposite has been synthesized for the treatment of tetracycline (TC) in aquatic solutions [85]. Various parameters such as the effect of zeta potential, concentration of containment, and pH effect were examined. A pH range, 6.0–7.0, demonstrated the highest adsorption efficiency due to the lower electrostatics repulsion. The effect of concentration of TC and different metal ions\nChitosan–Graphene-Grafted Nanocomposite Materials 173\n(Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2) revealed a maximum adsorption of 47.5 at pH 3.0 50.2 mmol kg 1 and 69.2 mmol kg 1 at pH 6.0 for TC, while in the absence of cations, the adsorption of TC onto MS-Ch-GO was found to be 50.2 mmol kg 1 at pH 3.0 to 67.6 mmol kg 1 at pH 6.0, respectively. The effect of Cu(II) concentration (0.1, 0.2 mM) was also examined to observe the change in the adsorption efficiency of TC on MS-Ch-GO. The improvement in the adsorption capacity of TC was found in the presence of Cu(II) on increasing the pH of the solution from 3.0 to 7.0. Moreover, at pH 7.0, the MS-ChGO composite showed the highest adsorption capacity for 0.1 mM and 0.2 mM Cu(II) as 173.60 mmol kg 1 and 183.47 mmol kg 1, respectively.  Improvement in the adsorption of TC in the presence of Cu(II) might be due to the formation of a complex among Cu (II) between TC and MSCG (where Cu(II) acts as bridge). Pseudo-second-order kinetics and Freundlich isotherm models were best fitted for the optimal adsorption of TC and metal ions.\nGraphene-based GO-Ch-FeOOH nanocomposite has been fabricated by the reaction of graphene oxide, chitosan, and  FeS using the sol–gel chemical route [86]. The prepared material was investigated under various conditions of physico-chemical parameters, namely, sorbent mass, pH, temperature, shaking speed, and contact time. The synthesized material achieved better adsorption capacity toward the removal of Pb(II) which may be owing to the existence of new functional groups in the matrix of GO-Ch-FeOOH. The pH of solution also plays an important role for optimal adsorption of metal ions. The adsorption capacity of Pb(II) increased with increasing solution’s pH (from 3 to 5.5). After a pH of 5.5, a decline in the adsorption efficiency was found which may be due to the protonation of amine group (–NH2 to –NH3) as a result of electrostatic repulsion between NH3 and Pb(II). On the other hand, at higher pH, sufficient –OH\n- adsorbed on the surface of composite led to the decline in the adsorption capacity of Pb(II). A thermodynamic study established the applicability of the Langmuir adsorption isotherm (on the basis of higher R2 value) compared to the Freundlich model. Thus, chitosan–graphene-based nanocomposites have a potential to treat wastewater for the removal of heavy metal ions. Chitosan-gelatin/GO (Ch-gel-GO) was used by Zhang et al. for the adsorption of heavy metals from aqueous solutions. In addition to this, Fan et al. [87] disclosed that a magnetic chitosan–rGO composite material can be exploited for the efficient removal of Cr(VI) from polluted waters."

      "text" : "The removal of fuchsine dye from contaminated waters using magnetic graphene nanocomposites was investigated by Wang et al. [88]. Results\n174 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nindicated high removal efficiency with fast adsorption time, rendering the composite a suitable material for purification of water. In recent studies, Fan et al. demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of methylene blue (MB) in polluted water can be enhanced by using a magnetic chitosan–rGO composite material [4]. Nguyen-Phan et al. reported that a 3D wormhole like mesoporous titanosilicate–rGO was used for the removal of methylene blue from waste water [89]. The effect of Ti dopant in an Si matrix was investigated which established that a high concentration of Ti (i.e., 20 mol%) enhanced the adsorption capacity of the composite. On the other hand, improvement in the concentration of Ti resulted in a negative effect on the photocatalytic dye degradation activity. Similar work was reported by Li et al. to fabricate a Mg(OH)2–rGO composite by the simultaneous reduction of MgCl2 and GO using NaOH [90]. Mg(OH)2 helped rGO to maintain a mesoporous structure and high surface area which proved to be beneficial for the removal of MB from water. Magnetic Ni-rGO nanocomposites were fabricated by the simultaneous hydrazine reduction of GO and NiCl2 [91]. A complete adsorption of organic dyes (RhB and MB) was achieved in 4 h. This work was repeated by Li et al., showing that a Ni–rGO nanocomposite material can be successfully used in the removal of aromatic compounds (benzene, toluene, and dimethylbenzene) from aqueous and non-aqueous solutions.\nGraphene-coated biochar has been employed for the removal of Poly aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) [92]. As compared to native biochar, the adsorption capacity of biochar with graphene coating increased by 20 times. The P25–rGO composite material showed the potential to adsorb methylene blue from an aqueous solution by using a self-assembly process of P25 on the graphene sheets. An improvement in the adsorption capacity was achieved by using nanoribbons or nanotubes because of high surface area in nanosheets as compared to other nanostructures. Tifeng Jiao et al. evaluated the degradation capacity of methylene blue (MB) and Rhodamine B (RhB) from textile wastewater via GO-based composite hydrogels by selfassembly of Ch and GO in an in situ reduction approach [93]. The outcome of experiments indicated that prepared 3D GO-based hydrogels efficiently removed dyes and exhibited good photocatalytic performance for RhB and MB in accordance with the pseudo-second-order model. Authors concluded that chitosan molecule was incorporated to facilitate the gelation process of the GO sheets. For the removal of a pharmaceutical compound (dorzolamide) from biomedical synthetic wastewaters, a novel graphite oxide/poly(acrylic acid)-grafted chitosan nanocomposite (GO/Ch) was fabricated and used as a biosorbent [94]. GO-Ch showed a higher adsorption capacity in comparison with the parent materials (graphite oxide and\nChitosan–Graphene-Grafted Nanocomposite Materials 175\npoly(acrylic acid)-grafted chitosan). It implied that the reactive groups of GO and Ch interact with amino groups of dorzolamide and the abundance of carboxyl groups of GO-CSA composite was the main reason for enhancing its adsorption capacity.\nA novel magnetic bioadsorbent composite made up of magnetic chitosan and graphene oxide (MChGO) was prepared by Fan et al. [4]. Optimization of dye was achieved at pH 3, whereas pH 12 was preferable for desorption. Kinetic experiments presented relatively “fast” adsorption together with the best fitting of modified pseudo-second-order equation. The equilibrium data were fitted to the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Langmuir−Freundlich models, with maximum adsorption capacities (391, 401, and 425 mg g 1, respectively) at 25 °C, 45 °C, and 65 °C. In accordance with the thermodynamic theory, the positive values of ΔHº suggested endothermic nature of the adsorption while the negative values of ΔG° indicated high adsorption affinity for dye molecules. Synthesis of graphite oxide (GO) with magnetic chitosan (Ch) to form (GO-Ch) was also carried out to serve as an adsorbent for an industrial dye (Reactive Black 5) [95]. An effective synthesis method for the preparation of the MGCh nanocomposite material was conducted by Sheshmani et al. to treat Acid Orange 7 (AO7) [96]. Dye removal efficiency was highly dependent on medium pH, contact time, and adsorbent concentration. Data indicated that MGCh adsorbent has a good potential for the removal of dye in wastewater. Some important chitosan–graphenegrafted nanocomposites for water treatment are listed in Table 5.3."

These nanocomposites have been successfully employed for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants. The Ch-GOgrafted material was selected on the basis of existence of different functional groups (–NH2, –H, –OOH) in the matrix of a composite which provides a porous nanostructure via hydrogen bonding and other interactions. Morphological characterization confirmed the formation of a porous nanocomposite of Ch-GO. The data of metal ion adsorption and dyes removal efficiency established that Ch-GO-based nano-materials have showed good pollution-removal potential.

Textile industries are the largest and fastest growing industries, therefore consuming a large amount of water and active ingredients such as dyes and coloration for the finishing of different fibers. These active ingredients enhance the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and total organic compounds (TOC) of water and show toxic effects toward the human body. Therefore, reprocessing the polluted water is the only way to minimize the hazardous effects of these textile effluents.

      "heading" : "6.1 Introduction",
      "text" : "The major environmental problem currently is the generation of effluents (pollutants) from the textile industry, leather industry, food industry, pulp and paper industry, and paint industry. These industries use large quantities of water for their processing and produce wastewaters with different chemical compositions [1]. Color water may be the most problematic.\n*Corresponding author: saifchaudhary09@gmail.com\n188 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nIn general, textile industries largely discharge the color-containing water during the dyeing process. Asian countries, particularly India, have large textile industries that play a major role in their economics. More than 100,000 commercial dyes with over 7 105 tons of color stuff are produced and consumed every year. China is the largest exporter of color stuffs, whereas India is the second one. Worldwide, textile industries alone discharge more than approximately 10% of total discharged dyes [2, 3].\nColor stuffs discharged in water enhance chemical oxygen demands (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and total organic compounds (TOC) of water. These enhancements in BOD, COD, and TOC affect the aesthetic properties of water and are environmentally unacceptable. Moreover, these dyes may cover up the water surface, and reduce the amount of dissolved oxygen, and also reduce the penetration of light, which affect the photosynthetic activities of living creatures present in the water, thereby severely affecting the food source of aquatic organisms [3]. Dyes are non-biodegradable organic pollutants, and therefore, their degradation has become a major concern, which is not easy. Despite this, the removal\nTextile Wastewater Treatment 189\nof color stuffs from water or effluents is of great concern. To achieve the momentum in dye removal, it is necessary to develop more suitable treatment technologies with respect to cost, feasibility, practicability, reliability, stability, environmental impact, sludge production, operational difficulty, pre-treatment requirements, the extent of the removal, and the potential toxic by-products. Complete removal of color stuffs from water is sometime associated with the degradation of dye molecules, but it may not be applicable to all types of color stuffs [4–6]. It is a challenge for researchers to develop the economically and environmentally effective treatment technology."

      "heading" : "6.2 Classification of Dyes and Their Toxicity",
      "text" : "Color stuffs, referred to as dyes, can absorb light in the visible range of the spectrum at a certain wavelength and has high affinity towards substrates on which applied. A large number of natural and synthetic dyes are being used in various industries [7, 8]. The food industry frequently uses natural dyes, while the textile industries use synthetic dyes. The chromophore groups such as –N=N–, =C=O, =C=C=, –C=NH, –CH=N–, NO, N–OH, –NO2 or –NO– OH, and –C=S are responsible for the color of dyes [9, 10] (Table 6.1).\nDyes are classified as acidic, basic, direct, disperse, mordant, pigment, reactive, solvent, sulfur, and vat dyes (Figure 6.1). Acidic, direct, mordant, and reactive dyes are anionic; basic dyes are cationic; whereas pigments, disperse, and solvent dyes are non-ionic [11, 12] (Table 6.2).\nAnionic dyes, having amine (NH2), carboxy (COO ), hydroxy (OH -), and sulfonate (SO3 ) groups, acquire net negative charge, while cationic dyes has net positive charge due to protonation of amine or sulfur-containing groups. These dyes are highly visible, even at very low concentration, and absorb and reflect the sunlight entering water, thus hindering photosynthesis [13].\nMoreover, they show acute and chronic effects toward living organisms depending on their concentration and length of exposure. Anionic and cationic dyes are used for the coloring of natural and synthetics fibers. Dyes containing –N=N– groups are called azo dyes which have a wide application in textile, leather tanning, paper production, food, color photography, pharmaceuticals and medicine, cosmetic, hair coloring, wood staining, agricultural, biological, and chemical research, light-harvesting arrays, and photo electrochemical cells [14].\nConsequently, a large number of synthetic dyes having azo groups are being released into the environment. Various synthetic azo dyes having low toxicity are being applied to various substances. These dyes usually\n190 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nproduce aromatic amines on anaerobic reduction of –N=N– groups which can be toxic and harmful [15].\nLarge exposure of dyes shows allergic, mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic effects toward the human body; moreover, it causes bladder cancer, splenic sarcomas, and hepato carcinomas [16–18]. Generally, complex\nTextile Wastewater Treatment 191\ndyes and basic dyes are carcinogenic due to the presence of metals and aromatic rings.\nThese dyes have a high intensity of color which decrease the sunlight penetration in water and affect the photosynthetic activity of aquatic life. Azo dyes have toxic amines groups; anthraquinone-based dyes do not degrade in water; and reactive dyes are highly soluble in water, which produce serious troubles in the environment. These colorants can also produce numerous dysfunctions in the kidneys, reproductive system, liver, brain, and central nervous system in the human body. Moreover, the release of dyes also alter the pH values to either extreme acidic or alkaline, and high temperatures, high BOD, COD, solid, oil, and possibly toxic organics that include phenols into water which may change the water quality and cause large physiological and biochemical changes in water. These changes in water quality show hazards toward aquatic plant and fishes [19, 20]. Therefore, focus on specific methods and technologies to remove dyes from different kinds of wastewater streams is desired."

      "text" : "The treatment of colored water, before discharge in water bodies, and reuse of dye-contaminated water after the treatment process have become an emerging issue for cleaning the environment. The removal of color from dye-contained wastewater is a subject of prime concern\n192 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nfor scientist. Government agencies from various countries have become very stringent regarding the discharge of dyes as effluents from industrial units. Environmental agencies in both developed and developing countries are making efforts to ensure that the industries treat their color effluents to follow given standards. Moreover, maximum concentration limits of color stuffs in water have also been set. However, most of the industries do not follow these guidelines and discharge large a concentration of color stuffs in water and cause hazardous effects. Thus, treatment of these colorants in water before discharge and consumption is necessary.\nColor water treatment (decolorization) is based on either photocatalytic degradation of color substance through the bond breakages or complete removal of color substance. Decolorization of water is the result of shifts of absorption of light from the visible to the ultraviolet or infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nVarious technologies such as nano-filtration, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, coagulation, flocculation, electro-flotation, electro-kinetic coagulation, oxidation, irradiation, or electrochemical processes, and aerobic and anaerobic microbial degradation have been utilized for the decolorization of water [21–25] (Table 6.3). However, various disadvantages, such as high cost, low efficiency, limited versatility, need for specialized equipment, interference by other wastewater constituents, large production of sludge, and poor handling of the generated waste, are associated with these methods. Various technologies used in decolorization of colored water have been discussed in several reports [26]. The development of efficient, economic, and eco-friendly technologies for decolorization of the colored water is very important. Being a surface phenomenon, adsorption is being utilized as an eco-friendly and economical treatment process to reduce dye contents in the water system.\nTextile Wastewater Treatment 193"

      "heading" : "6.4 Sorption Technology",
      "text" : "The adsorption process is a surface phenomenon, and involves the interaction between the adsorbate (solute) and the adsorbent (solid surface). Small-sized particle, high surface area, large number of active sites, and magnetic character of adsorbent respond to the higher removal capacity of dyes [27].\nThis phenomenon is known to be simple, inexpensive, and efficient for the dye removal from water or wastewater. Moreover, it does not require the pre-treatment step before its application. Besides, sorption needs less working area, has lower sensitivity to diurnal variation, does not produce toxic chemicals, and is flexible in design and operation.\nAdsorbent and dye interact either physically or chemically during the sorption process. Physical interactions involve weak bonding such as van der Waals, hydrogen, and dipole–dipole, while chemical interactions are characterized by strong inter-particle bonds, such as covalent, and ionic bonds, due to an exchange of electrons. Adsorption mechanism and their kinetics can be devised from the application of both linear and nonlinear isotherms to equilibrium data, and various kinetic relationships, respectively [28, 29]. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms are most commonly used to quantify the amount of adsorbate adsorbed by an adsorbent.\nThe enhanced remediation of dye contents has been observed by using various solid supports. As already stated, various factors such as dye/sorbent interaction, sorbent surface area, particle size, temperature, pH, and contact time largely affect the sorption capacity of the solid surface [30].\nThe molecular size of dye and the number of groups attached to the dye are also responsible for adsorption fluctuation. Adsorbents having a large surface area, large active sites, and porous in nature may significantly remove dye molecules; however, the smaller size of dye particles may effectively be adsorbed than bigger molecules. This is due to diffusion limitations [31]."

      "text" : "Numerous adsorbents, such as activated carbon [32], biomasses [33], clay minerals [34], zeolites [35], waste materials [36], and metal-based adsorbents [37], have been used for the adsorptive removal of dyes. Metal-based adsorbents, particularly metal oxides, have expertise in effective removal of dyes [38].\n194 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nThe repeating cycle of the used adsorbent enhances its adsorption efficiency. Attempts have been made for the regeneration of exhausted adsorbents via desorption of dyes using an acid or a base [39, 40]. However, this step requires the separation of exhausted adsorbents from water. Filtration and centrifugation are adopted for the separation of exhausted adsorbents but now is avoided due to high cost processing. Surprisingly, newly developed magnetic adsorbents are having an advantage over filtration and centrifugation due to low cost, easy handling, and response to a low magnetic field.\nIn addition, it has been estimated that functionalized and stable magnetic nano-sized adsorbents can be most attractive and an advanced technique for water purification [41–43]. Functionalized adsorbents, having large hydroxyl or other function groups on their surface, can strongly trap the dye contents at various pH [44] (Figures 6.2 and 6.3). Therefore, a large number of eco-friendly, functionalized nano adsorbents have been developed with remarkable potential for dye remediation from water, waste water, and aqueous solution. Stabilized and functionalized adsorbents could be achieved by functionalization of nanoparticles through organic materials such as polymer and higher acids.\nHowever, the drawback associated with functionalized adsorbents is the detachment of NPs from organic parts during the treatment process. This may cause toxicity on long-term accumulation of NPs in water. Therefore, various environmentally sound and stable adsorbents were developed and preferred for the dye remediation [45].\nRecent development in advance water treatment technology is the production of flexible, thermally, and mechanically stable and magnetic multi-functional units, having a large number of special features for\nTextile Wastewater Treatment 195\ndecolorization of colored water. These developed multifunctional units are referred to as composites, which could be achieved by certain size scale mixing of various materials such as inorganic particles and biopolymer, polymer, oxidizing, or reducing agents, and other carbonaceous materials through methods such as co-precipitation, sol–gel, etc. [46].\nRecently, the mixing of inorganic and organic components at the nanometric scale provided the advancement in water purification techniques. These types of materials are referred to as organic–inorganic hybrid nanocomposite. Therefore, application of this sorption technique would be the nourishing step, under above-mentioned factors, to meet discharge color standards. For easing the way of young scientists for the search and development of more adsorbents, herein, we have listed (Table 6.4) the most latest available literature on recently used composites for dyes removal. This chapter will help the scientific community to improve the quality of the water treatment process."

      "text" : "Recently, Zn-Al double-layered hydroxides (ZnAl–LDHs-3) have been developed via hydrothermal method for the removal of three different types of dyes such as Congo red, Methyl orange, and Active red (X-3B) [47]. The maximum absorption capacity of ZnAl–LDO–3 was observed as 1540, 1153, and 390 mg/g for Congo red, Methyl Orange, and Active Red (X-3B), respectively. These adsorbents have been proved the most potential adsorbent for dye containing wastewater treatment. Long et al.

Adsorption data well fitted to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm, and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacities for Methylene Blue, Orange G, and Amaranth were 344.8, 192.3, and 146.2 mg/g, respectively. An advance feature of adsorbents is their separation on application of a low magnetic field at equilibrium.\nSimilarly, magnetic Fe@graphite nanocomposite (Fe@G-N) was also developed for the adsorptive removal of anionic dyes from aqueous solutions [49]. Two anionic dyes, Acid Red 88 (AR88) and Direct Orange 26 (DO26), were removed from aqueous solutions at different parameters, such as initial dye concentration (5–40 mg/L), pH of solution (4–10), and temperature (20–60 °C). The adsorption results obtained from batch experiments suggested that the kinetic of the reaction well fitted to the pseudosecond-order model, and the isotherm well followed both Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models. Magnetic hydrogel beads, a modified gum tragacanth/graphene oxide, were used for the adsorptive removal crystal violet (CV) and Congo red (CR) from their solutions [50]. The observed result showed that adsorption kinetics was well addressed by the pseudosecond-order kinetic model and isotherm by the Langmuir isotherm model where the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity for CV and CR was 94.0, and 101.74 mg/g, respectively. In addition, the prepared adsorbent could be reutilized for three adsorption–desorption cycles without any significant loss of adsorption capacity.\nAnother magnetic composite, MCM-41, has been utilized for decolorization of colored water [51]. Composite materials were developed by the surfaceinitiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) of (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) and poly (glycidyl methacrylate) p(GMA), followed by the functionalization with tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TAEA). The modified material was utilized as an adsorbent for cleaning of Direct Blue 6 (DB-6) and Direct Black-38 (DB-38) dyes from an aqueous medium. The magnetic character of the composite material was investigated by the VSM technique which showed the saturation magnetization at 19.6 emu/g. The adsorbent was found to be highly effective for the removal of both dyes at a wide pH range of 4.0–7.0, and the experimental data well fitted to the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The magnetic composite was very stable, and could easily be separated and regenerated.\nA cross-linked polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS)-based hybrid inorganic–organic nanohybrid having a specific surface area of 42.8 m2/g was also fabricated for adsorptive removal of acidic dyes, Methyl orange (MO) [52]. The cross-linked adsorbent was fabricated through the Schiff\n204 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nbase chemistry using octa-amino POSS as building blocks and glutaraldehyde as a dual functional reagent. The hybrid inorganic–organic nanohybrid was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. MO could effectively be removed from the aqueous solution with a maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 237.5 mg/g. The reaction rate was well explained by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the reaction was spontaneous and exothermal. The specialty of the adsorbent was that it could effectively be regenerated using the methanol/NaOH (9:1) mixture.\nAnother cross-linked composite, cross-linked activated organo-bentonite (AO Bent)/sodium alginate (SA), has been developed for cationic and anionic dyes cleanup from aqueous solutions [53]. The AO Bent/sodium alginate (SA) composite was prepared by the intercalation of sodium alginate in activated organo-bentonite, and the cross-linking between sodium alginate and chlorohydric acid was confirmed from the X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Furthermore, batch experiments were performed to remove cationic dye, Methylene blue, and anionic dye, Methyl orange, from their aqueous solutions. Adsorption data obtained from the batch experiment were well fitted to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model. The prepared adsorbent was considered as cost effective and ecofriendly.\nSimilarly, a magnetically recoverable porous cross-linked polyethylenimine (MPEI) composite was developed for enhanced adsorptive removal of six anionic dyes [54]. Sorption mechanism and rates were well explained by the Langmuir monolayer adsorption and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The reaction was endothermic and spontaneous. Anionic dyes having the –SO3\n− group were electrostatically adsorbed on to the positively charged MPEI, which was confirmed by the FT-IR and EDX spectra of dye-loaded MPEI. In addition, composite materials could easily be regenerated in an alkaline medium and utilized for a number of cycles. Salama et al. [55] fabricated carboxymethyl cellulose-grafted polymethacrylic acid (CMC-g-PMAA) having extraordinary adsorption behavior for Methylene blue, which exhibited extremely high removal capacity. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of the hybrid material for Methylene blue was found to be 671 mg/g. Reaction kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model.\nIn the same year, Sun et al. [56] synthesized magnetic MnFe2O4/diatomite composite via the precipitation/hydrothermal method for cationic dyes such as methylene blue and basic fuchsine (rosaniline hydrochloride) dyes remediation. The adsorption process was fast and the maximal\nTextile Wastewater Treatment 205\nadsorption capacity for methylene blue and basic fuchsine obtained was 104.06 and 284.09 mg/g, respectively. The sorption process was recorded as an endothermic and spontaneous reaction.\nSimilarly, magnetic chitosan/SiO2/CNTs (MNCSC) nano-composite was utilized for direct blue 71 (DB71), and Reactive blue 19 (RB19) cleaning from aqueous solutions under various parameters such as initial dye concentration, contact time, adsorbent dosage, initial pH, etc. [57]. The monolayer maximum adsorption capacity of MNCSC was achieved at 61.35 and 97.08 mg/g for DB71 and RB19, respectively. Three different kinds of kinetic models were applied but the pseudo-second-order equation well fitted the adsorption data. The sorptions of anionic dyes have also been investigated on two prepared adsorbents, isoreticular nanoporous Zn(II)-MOFs (TMU-16) and TMU-16-NH2 [58]. Results demonstrated that TMU-16-NH2 showed a higher removal capacity than TMU-16 due to hydrogen bonding between dyes and amine groups.\nLow-cost and ecofriendly zinc oxide-loaded activated carbon (ZnO-AC) was also applied for the treatment of organic dyes such as Orange G (OG) and Rhodamine B (Rh-B) [59]. The optimized adsorption capacity of ZnO-AC for OG and Rh-B was 153.8 and 128.2 mg/g, respectively. The sorption reaction was endothermic up to a temperature of 40 °C; however, the removal of OG decreased with increased temperature. Similarly, Dil et al. [60] utilized zinc (II) oxide nanorod-loaded activated carbon (ZnONRs-AC) for the removal of azo dye from the aqueous solution and optimized their removal capacity under different parameters including initial concentration, adsorbent dosage, pH, temperature, ultrasonic time, etc. At an initial concentration of 18 and 14 mg/L of Methylene blue and Crystal violets, respectively, the maximum adsorption capacity was recorded as 83.9 and 81.6 mg/g for MB and CV dyes, respectively.\nRecently, nano-magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticles were impregnated onto the walnut shell (Fe3O4-WNS), and used for the removal of methyl violet and rRhodamine 6G dyes from their aqueous solutions [61]. Various models such as multiple linear regression, random forest, and artificial neural network were applied to predict the removal efficiency of magnetic adsorbent against these dyes. Han et al. [62] synthesized the hydrophobic surface-modified silica aerogel (MSA) and hydrophilic (hydroxyl-group) silica aerogel (HSA) which could remove Rhodamine B (RhB) and Methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions. The surface area of prepared MSA and HSA was 880.47 and 628.52 m2/g, respectively, which was much higher than silica aerogel. Due to a large surface area, MSA and HSA removed 65.74 and 47.21 mg/g of Methylene blue, and 134.25 and 185.61 mg/g of\n206 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nRhB, respectively. The reaction mechanism of monolayer and kinetics followed the pseudo-second order.\nRecently, Fe3+ ions (FeCl3.6H2O) were introduced into bagasse biomass to achieve a novel magnetic porous adsorbent, g-Fe2O3/C, for the catalytic degradation and removal of methylene blue (MB) from the aqueous solution (Figure 6.4) [94]. The g-Fe2O3/C exhibited handsome adsorption and catalytic degradation abilities for MB. Similarly, quince seed mucilage (QSM)-based magnetic nanocomposite adsorbent (MNCA) has been developed by the in situ formation of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles into the QSM solution for biosorption of MB from the aqueous solution (Figure 6.5a–c) [95]. Batch experiments were performed to optimize the adsorption capacity of MNCA for MB under the influence of various parameters. The process was spontaneous and exothermic following the pseudo-second-order kinetics. A Langmuir adsorption isotherm model was well fitted to the experimental data tested for MB, and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity was 179 mg/g. These results indicate that the hybrid composite can be employed as efficient low-cost adsorbents with excellent dye adsorption performance in the wastewater treatment process. These were some recent advancements in the dye cleanup technology which made the process significant for dye remediation from water.\nTextile Wastewater Treatment 207"

Dyes are planar as well as complex molecules, which can be easily adsorbed on to the hybrid composite having a large number of oxygenous functional groups by electrostatic attraction\n208 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nand hydrogen-bonding interactions. The bonding between the adsorbent surface and dye molecules can be simply characterized by the FTIR spectrum. The possible interaction mechanisms between the adsorbents and dye molecules have been discussed in various literatures [96–100]. They compared the FTIR spectrum of unloaded adsorbents to dye-loaded adsorbents and revealed that the characteristic peaks for the dye-loaded adsorbents were broadened and shifted slightly. For example, Liu et al. [96] investigated the mechanism of anionic dye acid blue 93 (AB93) and cationic dye methylene blue (MB) adsorption by a cellulose-based bio adsorbent. Both AB93 and MB were planar molecules that could be easily adsorbed on the cellulose-based bioadsorbents by van der Waals force and hydrogen-bonding interactions. To confirm the mechanism, they compared the FTIR spectrum (Figure 6.6) of cellulose-based bioadsorbents and dye-loaded cellulose-based bioadsorbents, and revealed that the OH/NH stretching vibration broadened and shifted from 3434 to 3429 and 3424 cm−1, CO-NH stretching vibration shifted from 1667 to 1672 and 1655 cm−1, COO− asymmetric stretching vibration shifted from 1564 to 1582 and 1559 cm−1, COO− symmetric stretching vibration from 1411 to 1402 and 1402 cm−1, and the C–OH plane shifted from 1330 to 1347 and 1325 cm−1 for AB93 and MB adsorbed cellulose-based bioadsorbents, respectively. No significant change was found for the peak corresponding to CH stretching vibration at 2942 cm−1.\nTextile Wastewater Treatment 209\nThese shiftings in the characteristics peaks for cellulose-based bioadsorbents suggested the specific electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions between the functional groups of dye molecules and the adsorbent (Figure 6.7). A number of literature on the basis of FTIR spectrum studies are now available to understand the dye adsorption mechanism for composites which generally suggested that electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions are responsible for dye adsorption on to the composite surface [97–100]. Besides the electrostatic attraction and hydrogen-bonding interactions, complexation between the metallic sites of the adsorbent and electron-donating sites of dyes or π–π interactions between the π electrons in a carbonaceous adsorbent such as graphene oxide and the π electron in the aromatic ring of a dyes are also responsible for the adsorption of dyes onto the adsorbent surfaces.\nTo understand the π–π interactions between π electrons in a carbonaceous adsorbent such as graphene oxide and the π electron in the aromatic\n210 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nring of a dye, Tran et al. [97] investigated the mechanisms of sorption of methylene green 5 (MG5) on to the commercial activated charcoal, synthesized activated carbons, and prepared biochar (Figure 6.8). They suggested that π–π interactions majorly contributed to the adsorption of MG5 on to the adsorbent surface. The π–π interactions between the MG5 and the adsorbent surface could be confirmed by the FTIR analysis which showed that a peak corresponding to the skeletal vibration of aromatic C-C bonds decreased in intensity and upshifted after MG5 adsorption. Similarly, Chen et al. [101] also suggested that the π–π interactions played a major role in the dye adsorption mechanism."

Adsorbents having large adsorption capacities for several dyes are added herein. The obtained concluding remark is that the porous, high surface sites containing adsorbents such as organic–inorganic nanocomposites show excellent magnetism, superior adsorption capacity, and have excellent catalytic degradation ability for dyes. Thus, on including the list of adsorbents, and the study of inexpensive adsorbents, a more suitable and conventional method can be obtained at a certain interval of time that has great potential for the clean-up of environmental pollutants."

      "heading" : "7.1 Introduction",
      "text" : "The level of environmental pollution has increased alarmingly due to rapid growth of industrialization and urbanization [1–3]. Hexavalent chromium [Cr (VI)] and dyes contribute to a significant extent toward environmental pollution. Wastewater containing approximately 170,000 tons of chromium is being discharged into different water bodies every year all over the world [4]. Similarly, about one million kilograms of dyes released from textile industries are being discharged into rivers and streams each year worldwide [5–7].\nCr (VI) is carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic. It causes a wide range of clinical/health problems such as damage to the liver and kidneys, lung carcinoma, nausea, dermatitis, nasal membrane inflammation, ulceration, irritation of the gastrointestinal tract, and renal damage as shown in Figure 7.1, when consumed above the permissible limit of 50 μg L-1 in potable water as fixed by the US EPA [8–10]. The compounds of Cr (VI) are mostly used in different industrial processes such as metal plating, leather tanning, and pigment manufacturing. Effluents containing high Cr (VI) concentration from these industries are discharged into the aquatic environments [11–13]. Being highly mobile in an aqueous environment, it contaminates the natural water ecosystems easily.\nDyes are also considered to be toxic or carcinogenic. Due to the complex aromatic structure and synthetic origin of dyes, these possess high chemical stability and low biodegradability in water. It causes a major problem in the discharge of large quantities of organic compounds in wastewater and becomes potentially harmful to the environment. Thus, treatment of industrial wastewater containing Cr (VI) and dyes has become an important and urgent environmental issue. Therefore, various physical, chemical,\nAdsorption of Cr (VI) and Textile Dyes 221\nand biological techniques such as precipitation [14], ion exchange [15], membrane filtration [16], electrochemical approaches [17], reverse osmosis [18], and adsorption [19] have been proposed for the treatment of waste water rich in Cr (VI) and toxic dyes. However, most of these techniques find a number of drawbacks such as high operational cost, low feasibility of scale-up for industrial applications, and ineffectiveness at high concentrations. On the other hand, adsorption has been recognized as one of the most promising techniques for the treatment of Cr (VI) from wastewater due to its several advantages which include high removal efficiency, low energy consumption, less chemical investment, and reusability [20–22]. Hence, different kinds of adsorbents such as activated carbon [23], biomass [24], clay minerals [25], zeolites [26], industrial and agricultural wastes [27, 28] have been used for the removal of Cr (VI) and dyes from the wastewater. Practical applications of these adsorbents are restricted because of low adsorption capacities and selectivities, which is due to less porosity, low surface area, lack of functional groups, and small dye-binding constants [29]. Thus, there was an urgent need for the development of adsorbents having high porosity, large surface area, and high functionalities.\nIn recent years, nanomaterials have attracted great attention worldwide for various applications. Besides these, they are also being used as potential adsorbents in wastewater treatment due to their large surface area, enough active surface sites, and high adsorption capacity [30].\n222 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nSilica-based nanomaterials [31], graphene-based nanomaterials [32], titanate nanotubes [33], ferrites [34], layer double hydroxides [35], etc. have recently been successfully applied for the adsorption of Cr (VI) and various noxious dyes. In this chapter, we have discussed the adsorption behavior of silica-based nanomaterials, titanate nanotubes, and layer double hydroxides (Figure 7.2) in terms of adsorption capacities, isotherm models, kinetics, and thermodynamics of adsorption. Maximum adsorption capacities obtained under optimum adsorption conditions such as adsorbent dose, concentration of Cr (VI) solution and dyes solution, pH, and temperature were presented in the tables. Detailed illustrations of mechanisms of adsorption were given in the form of figures. A roadmap describing the scope of the chapter is given in Figure 7.3.\nAdsorption of Cr (VI) and Textile Dyes 223"

      "text" : "Silica exhibits good physical and chemical properties such as water stability (nonswelling), thermal stability (up to 1500 °C), and good mechanical strength. Different kinds of silica materials such as amorphous silica, mesoporous silica, fumed silica, and silica gels have been synthesized. Among these, mesoporous silica is extensively used in various applications due to its high surface area and large number of of silanol (Si−OH) groups. Particularly, these are considered as high-capacity adsorbents as they exhibit enhanced accessibility to active centers [36] and fast mass transfer rates in the regular porous environment [37, 38]. Various ordered mesoporous silica materials such as SBA-15, USG-41, MCM-41, and their modified forms are used as adsorbents for the removal of Cr (VI) and dyes in recent years."

      "text" : "Barium titanate mesoporous silica (BaTiO3/SBA-15) prepared by an aerosol-assisted solid-state reaction using SBA-15 as a hard template exhibited high adsorption capacity as compared to bulk BaTiO3 and pure SBA-15. It might be attributed to its high porosity and large surface area, which enhanced the oxy-anionic species of chromium to get adsorbed at the internal surface of the pores. Moreover, the development of a positive surface charge on the nanomaterial due to oxygen vacancy adsorbed negatively charged Cr (VI) species effectively by electrostatic interactions [39]. SBA15 nanoparticles modified with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxy-silane exhibited an improved adsorption capacity of 48.31 mg g-1. These nanoparticles with a large pore size distribution facilitated surface functionalization due to which there was coordination of Cr (VI) species on their surfaces leading to higher adsorption. 3-aminopropyltrimethoxy-silane-functionalized USG-41 nanoparticles with a broad pore size distribution exhibited still higher adsorption capacity of 111.1 mg g-1. MCM-41 nanoparticles moldified with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxy-silane with a narrow pore size distribution exhibited low adsorption capacity of 39.68 mg g-1 [40]. Immobilization of TiO2 onto MCM-41 provides adequate number of active sites on the surface of TiO2-MCM-41. As a result, the adsorbent showed an enhanced adsorption capacity.\nThe sample with 20 weight percentage (4.0 mmol g-1) TiO2 exhibited a maximum adsorption capacity of 120.64 mg g-1. Less uptake of the sample with 25 weight percentage (5.02 mmol g-1) TiO2 might be attributed to the loss of ordered hexagonal structure of MCM-41that led to irregularity in\n224 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nthe surface sites. The mechanism of adsorption was shown in Scheme 7.1, which indicated that positive charges were developed on the surface of the adsorbent below the pHZPC (i.e., 6.2) due to which negatively charged univalent Cr (VI) species (HCrO4\n-) were adsorbed through electrostatic attraction below this pH (i.e., 5.5). At very low and high pH, adsorption is decreased because bivalent Cr (VI) species namely Cr2O7\n2- at lower pH and CrO4\n2- at higher pH were the dominant ones which would neutralize twice the number of active sites available on the surface of adsorbents as compared to univalent species [31]. This led to a decrease in adsorption at both lower and higher pH values [41]. Moreover, a decrease in adsorption at higher pH might be attributed to the fact that the typical siliceous hexagonal structure of MCM-41 was destroyed above pH 8.0 [42]. However, maximum adsorption capacity of 904 mg g-1 was obtained for MCM-41 samples with a large surface area and uniform diameter [43]. This indicated not only active sites but also large surface area and uniform particle size are responsible for enhanced adsorption capacity. Maximum adsorption capacity and optimum adsorption conditions such as pH, temperature, initial Cr (VI) concentration, adsorbent dose, fitted isotherm, kinetic model, thermodynamic parameters, and mechanism of adsorption for Cr (VI) onto mesoporous silica are given in Table 7.1."

(ii) Transport of the dye within the pores of the adsorbent, with only a small amount of dye being adsorbed on the external surface (particle diffusion). (iii) Adsorption of the dye on an inner surface of the adsorbent.\nHuang et al. have synthesized ordered SBA-15 using nonionic surfactant as a template in acidic conditions and studied the adsorption behaviors of cationic dyes such as methylene blue (MB) and Janus Green B (JGB), an anionic dye [reactive black 5 (RB 5)], and a neutral dye named dimethyl phthalate (DMP) [7]. The structural formula of (a) MB, (b) JGB (c) RB 5 and (d) DMP are given in Figure 7.4. SBA-15 has shown enhanced adsorption capability toward cationic dyes due to the electrostatic attraction between cationic dyes and the anionic nature of SBA-15 whereas it does not absorb any anionic and neutral dyes. The adsorption capacities for MB and JGB were found to be 49.25 and 66.43 mg g-1, respectively, and adsorption isotherms were well fitted with Langmuir and Freundlich models.\nA facile non-polar solvent-assisted Stöber method has been developed by Wang et al. to synthesize ordered mesoporous silica materials with tunable pore size, diverse morphologies, and mesostructures by using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as the template and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as a silica precursor in a simple aqueous-phase synthesis system [44]. By simply changing the amount of n-hexane and aqueous ammonia in the system, ordered mesoporous silica with a pore size of 2.7–10.5 nm, various morphology (nanocubes, truncated nanocubes, coreshell microspheres, and twisted nanorods), high surface area up to 888 m2 g-1, and large pore volume of 1.55 cm3 g-1 are synthesized (Figure 7.5). Owing to their highly hydrophilic surface, large and accessible pores, and high surface area, the mesoporous silica materials exhibit an excellent performance in the adsorption of dye molecules of a large dimension (1.6 nm) with a maximum adsorption capacity of 106 mg g-1 in 10 min at 200 mg L-1 initial Rhodamine B (RhB) concentration.\nExtremely ordered mesoporous SBA-15 have been prosperously synthesized by Mirzae et al. through a plain sol−gel technique and then functionalized with polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer for acid blue 62 (AB62) dye adsorption.\nThe structural formula of (a) RhB and (b) AB 62 are given in Figure 7.6. Appropriate parameters for removing AB62 were at pH 2, adsorbent dosage of 0.03 g L–1, and contact time of 60 min at 25 °C. The experimental results suitably fit the Langmuir model and the adsorption was found to be physisorptive and exothermic [45].\nTsai et al. have demonstrated a high density of –COOH groups loading into SBA-16 via a one-pot synthesis route, which involves co-condensation\n230 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nof carboxyethylsilanetriol sodium salt (CES) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) templated by Pluronic F127 and P123 in an acidic medium. These functionalized materials are used to effectively remove two cationic dyes methylene blue (MB) and phenosafranine (PF) with the maximum adsorption capacities of -561 and 519 mg g-1, respectively, at pH 9 [46]. The adsorption behavior of MCM-41 on two basic dyes [basic green 5 (BG5) and basic violet 10 (BV10)] was studied by Juang et al. They investigated\nAdsorption of Cr (VI) and Textile Dyes 231\nthat MCM-41 might be a good adsorbent for the removal of basic dye pollutants from effluents, only when the effect of interactions between MCM41 and large dyes (BV10) on the pore structure stability of MCM-41 is insignificant [47]. Chemical structure of phenosafranine (PF), basic green\n232 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\n5 (BG5), basic violet 10 (BV10), acid red 1 (AR1), and acid blue 9 (AB9) are given in Figure 7.7.\nWu et al. have studied the adsorption of anionic dyes like Acid Fuchsine (AF) and Acid Orange II (AO) using MCM-41 functionalized with amine groups in the mesoporous silica framework (NH2-MCM-41) as the adsorbent [48]. Chemical structure of (a) Acid Fuchsine (AF) and (b) Acid\nAdsorption of Cr (VI) and Textile Dyes 233\nOrange II (AO) are given in Figure 7.8. The maximum adsorption capacity for AF was approximately 140.60 mg g-1 at pH 2.0 and 25 °C with NH2MCM-41 dosage 2.0 g L-1, and 278.38 mg g-1 for AO at pH 3.0, respectively. In single-component systems, equilibrium data fitted well the Langmuir and D-R models, suggesting the adsorption to be monolayer and physical in nature. Kinetic studies showed that the adsorption process could be better described by both the Lagergren pseudo-second-order and the Spahn and Schlunder models. Moreover, it was found that the adsorption was governed by film diffusion followed by intraparticle diffusion. Thermodynamic constant values ( Go<0, Ho<0 and So<0) demonstrated that the adsorption reactions of AF and AO onto NH2-MCM-41 were feasible, spontaneous, and exothermic under examined conditions. For binary component systems, AF and AO exhibited competitive adsorption onto NH2-MCM-41, and adsorption capacity values of AF and AO were reduced compared to those of the corresponding single-component systems. Furthermore, both in single and binary component systems, the experimental data could be better described by the Langmuir isotherm and the pseudo-second-order kinetic models.\nThe adsorption behavior of the polyamine functionalized mesoporous silica (MS-PEI) and 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane (APTES) functionalized mesoporous silica was (MS-APTES) studied by Nayab et al. toward anionic dyes [49]. The kinetic data support a pseudo-second-order adsorption behavior for both monolayer and polymer functionalized MS. The associated thermodynamic parameters (ΔG°, ΔH°, and ΔS°) reveal that the process of adsorption with MS-PEI is more spontaneous and energetically\n234 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nfavored as compared to the adsorption with MS-APTES. Taken together, the novel adsorbent system derived from a combination of MS and branched polymer (MS-PEI) shows a higher adsorption efficiency and capacity toward the anionic dyes than the monolayer-based adsorbent (MS-APTES).\nNanda et al. have synthesized in situ preparation of meso-MnO2MCM-41 and studied both dye adsorption and photodegradation. The intra-particle mesoporosity and high textural properties have a vital role for an efficient adsorption of dyes such as Rd 6G, MB, MG, and RhB [50]. Chemical structure of (a) Malachite Green (MG) and (b) Rhodamine 6G (Rd 6G) are given in Figure 7.9. Maximum adsorption capacity, optimum adsorption conditions such as pH, temperature, initial dye concentration, adsorbent dose, fitted isotherm, kinetic model, thermodynamic parameters, and mechanism of adsorption for dyes onto mesoporous silica are given in Table 7.2."

      "text" : "The mechanism for adsorption of coexisting Cr (III) and Cr (VI) onto titanate (TiO6) nanotubes was explained with the help of Scheme 7.2 [59]. According to it, a double-layer adsorption occurred when Cr (III) and Cr (VI) were coexisted. An ionic cluster of Cr (III) and Cr (VI) was formed first and these were bridged with Cr (III), which was adsorbed onto titanate nanotubes mainly by the ion exchange mechanism with the formation of Cr (III)–O–Cr (VI) linkage. The maximum adsorption capacity for Cr (III) and Cr (VI) was found to be 82.1 and 9.8 mg g-1, respectively. It was also observed that the rearrangement of Cr (III) from the second layer to the surface of titanate nanotubes takes place during unsaturation of adsorption sites resulting in the breakage of Cr(III)–O–Cr(VI) linkage which causes decrease in the adsorption of Cr(VI). Adsorption of Cr (VI) from aqueous solution onto amino-functionalized titanate nanotubes was investigated by Wang et al. [33]. The adsorbent was prepared by covalently grafting [1-(2-amino-ethyl)-3-aminopropyl] trimethoxysilane onto protonated titanate nanotubes and exhibited much higher adsorption capacity for the removal of Cr (VI) as compared to protonated titanate nanotubes. It is because of high porosity, surface area, and presence of a large number of protonated amino groups which possess good selectivity toward Cr (VI) species due to electrostatic attraction. The authors have suggested that protonated amino groups adsorb negatively charged Cr (VI) species via\nScheme 7.2 Schematic diagram of the synergetic adsorption of Cr (III) and Cr (VI) in the binary system [Reproduced from reference 59].\n240 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nelectrostatic attraction by exchanging NO3 - ions present earlier on them according to equations (7.1)–(7.3):\n–NH3 +NO3 – + HCrO4 – –NH3 +HCrO4 – + NO3 – (7.1)\n2 (–NH3 +NO3 –) + CrO4 2– (–NH3 +)2 CrO4 2– + 2NO3 – (7.2)\n2 (–NH3 +NO3 –) + Cr2O7 2– (–NH3 +)2 Cr2O7 2– + 2NO3 – (7.3)\nThe adsorbed Cr (VI) species were reduced partially to Cr (III) with the participation of H+ ions and electrons from amino groups as per the following chemical equations:\nCr2O7 2– + 14H+ + 6e– 2Cr3+ + 7H2O (7.4)\nCrO4 2– + 8H+ + 3e– 2Cr3+ + 4H2O (7.5)\nHCrO4 – + 7H+ + 3e– 2Cr3+ + 4H2O (7.6)\nCr (III) species so formed were chelated with amino groups and hence were not entered into the solution. The mechanism of adsorption was shown in Scheme 7.3. Experimental results followed the Langmuir isotherm model which suggested the presence of homogeneous active sites and monolayer adsorption of Cr (VI) onto the surface of both the adsorbents. Maximum adsorption capacity computed by the Langmuir isotherm model was found to be 153.85 mg g-1 for amino-functionalized titanate nanotubes whereas that for protonated titanate nanotubes was 26.60 mg g-1 at initial pH 5.0 and temperature 30 °C. Titanate nanotubes modified with 2-bromo-ethylamine hydrobromide exhibited higher adsorption capacity for the removal of Cr (VI) as compared to titanate nanotubes [60]. It was because the existence of a positive charge on its surface in a wide pH range (pH < 8) as its pHzpc was 8.2 and the presence of –NH2 groups in appropriate pH ranges, which caused electrostatic attraction toward negatively charged Cr (VI) species, leading to a large adsorption capacity. The maximum adsorption capacity of modified titanate nanotubes calculated from the Langmuir isotherm model was found to be 69.1 mg g-1, which was almost five times greater than that of titanate nanotubes. Maximum adsorption capacity, optimum adsorption conditions such as pH, temperature, initial Cr (VI) concentration, adsorbent dose, fitted isotherm, kinetic model, thermodynamic parameters, and mechanism of adsorption for Cr (VI) onto titanate nanotubes are listed in Table 7.1.\nAdsorption of Cr (VI) and Textile Dyes 241\nScheme 7.3 Schematic illustration of Cr (VI) adsorption–reduction mechanism onto amino-functionalized titanate nanotubes (reproduced from reference 33)."

      "text" : "Calcined titanate nanotubes (TNT) were synthesized by Xiong et al. with a hydrothermal treatment of the commercial TiO2 (Degussa P25) followed by calcination. The adsorption MB onto calcined TNT was studied. The pseudo-second-order model was the best to describe the adsorption kinetics and the intraparticle diffusion was not the rate-limiting step. The equilibrium adsorption data were in good agreement with the Langmuir isotherm model having a correlation coefficient of 0.993 indicating monolayer adsorption. The maximum adsorption capacity of 133.33 mg g-1 was obtained.\nThe mechanism of adsorption can be explained through chemical sorption which involves the formation of methylene blue-calcined titanate nanotube nanocomposite. Electrostatic attraction might be predominant in the initial bulk diffusion [61]. The morphological studies TEM (transmission electron microscopy) and HRTEM (high resolution TEM) of TNTs are shown in Figure 7.10.\n242 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nHsieh and his coworkers prepared TNTs by the hydrothermal method and investigated the liquid-phase adsorption behavior of MB onto TNTs. Highly porous titania nanotubes with the maximum surface were formed by hydrothermal treatment. The nanotubes are mainly mesoporous and their pore sizes were found to increase with calcination temperature. Adsorption mainly occurs through physisorption process and the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 290 mg g-1 [62]. Hierarchical 3D titanate nanotubes with pompon-like microspheres were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method in the presence of CH3COOH and H2O2. It indicates that the obtained material is rich in hydroxyl groups. The 3D-TNT microspheres exhibited excellent selective adsorption performance toward cationic dyes such as MB, NR, MG, and CV with very high rate of decolorization process. The saturated adsorption capacities for NR, MB, MG, and CV are found to be 401.8, 382.07, 361.95, and 322.5 mg g-1 at 25 °C respectively [63]. Lee et al. studied the adsorption behavior of\nAdsorption of Cr (VI) and Textile Dyes 243\nbasic dyes [basic green 5 (BG 5) and basic violet 10(BV 10)] on to titanate nanotubes and that of acid dyes (acid red 1 and acid blue 9) onto cetyltrimethylammonium (CTAC) chloride-modified TNTs. The low amount of Na+ favors good adsorption of TNTs and their CTAC-modified version for the removal of basic and acid dyes from aqueous solution through the cation and anion exchange mechanism [64]. The effect of hydrothermal synthesis temperature of TNTs on adsorption of BG5 and BV10 was investigated by Lee and his coworkers [65]. The sample prepared at 160 °C exhibited a maximum adsorption capacity of 216 mg g-1 for BG5, which is comparable to that exhibited by activated carbon. It may be due to the retention of a nanotubular structure with the retention of adequate titanate interlayer spacing, surface area, and pore volume suitable for adsorption at this temperature. Furthermore, the adsorption capacity of TNT for BG5 is greater than that for BV10. It might be attributed to the smaller size of BG5, which can efficiently be packed in TNT [66]. Maximum adsorption capacity, optimum adsorption conditions such as pH, temperature, initial dye concentration, adsorbent dose, fitted isotherm, kinetic model, thermodynamic parameters, and the mechanism of adsorption for dyes onto titanate nanotubes are given in Table 7.2."

      "text" : "Layered double hydroxides are referred to as hydrotalcite-like materials with a general formula [M(II)1-xM(III)x(OH)2]\nx+[Ax-].nH2O, where M(II) is the divalent metal ion, M(III) is the trivalent metal ion, and Ax- is the exchangeable interlayer anion [67]. These are a class of layered materials that possess a flat two-dimensional morphology composed of different elementary layers constituted by a hydroxy framework of different metal ions such as Mg2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+, etc. Isomorphous substitution of bivalent metal ions in the brucite-like hydroxy framework by trivalent metal ions such as Al3+, Cr3+, Fe3+, etc. gives rise to the generation of additional charge over the layers, which is counterbalanced by exchangeable anions such as Cl-, CO3 2-, SO4 2-, etc. In recent years, these are used extensively for water remediation through the removal of noxious anions (and interestingly sometimes cation) from waste waters [68, 69] because of their large surface area for the adsorption of anion, ability for facile exchange of interlayer anion, and tailorable hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature [70]. HTlcs can remove anions from the solution by three different mechanisms: (a) adsorption on external surfaces, (b) intercalation by anion exchange, and (c) intercalation by reconstruction of the calcined material. The third\n244 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nmechanism follows the calcination of LDH to produce intermediate nonstoichiometric oxides, which undergo rehydration in an aqueous medium and give back the hydroxide structure with different anions in the interlayers (memory effect) [71]."

      "text" : "Layered double hydroxides containing nitrates or chlorides in the interlayer, after modification and calcined forms, are generally explored for the removal of Cr (VI) [72, 73]. Houri et al. studied the removal of Cr (VI) Mg Al –Cl, Zn Al – Cl and Zn Cr - Cl with chloride as an interlayer anion. The authors reported 55 mg g-1 uptake capacity [72]. Bulbulian and co-workers studied the chromate uptake efficiency of MgAl LDHs and reported that the calcined ones are better adsorbents than as-synthesized forms. The authors studied the materials for real systems such as tannery waste and concluded that calcined samples were the best [74]. Goswamee et al. carried out the adsorption of Cr (VI) onto MgAl, NiAl, and ZnCr LDHs and found that MgAl was effective than the other ones. Among MgAl samples, those with higher Al content on calcination gave good uptake capacity. The rehydration efficiency of the MgAl sample made it a good adsorbent for Cr (VI) than NiAl and ZnCr [75]. Ternary HTs were used to increase the adsorption capacity. Zr4+ was incorporated over ZnAl and MgAl in different amounts and achieved a maximum chromate uptake capacity of 31 mg g-1 for calcined MgAlZr-HT (at 450 °C). With the incorporation of Zr4+, the surface charge increased that helped in the removal of anionic species of Cr (VI) [76]. Later in 2007, Carriazo et al. explored the anion exchange ability of chloride for chromate uptake and they compared the uptake capacity of chloride-LDHs with its carbonate counterpart. The results reported show that MgAl chloride samples are better adsorbents than even calcined MgAl sample [77]. Calcined MgAl-CO3 was also explored by Alvarez-Ayuso and Nugteren for the removal of Cr (VI) through reconstruction and reported 128 mg g-1 uptake [78]. Similar results were earlier reported by Rhee et al. through reconstruction over calcined MgAl-CO3 [79]. Lazaridis and coworkers investigated the sorption of Cr (VI) over MgAl-CO3 LDHs. The calcined material gave an uptake capacity of 120 mg g-1. The authors reported that with agitation speed, at low pH, and at high chromate concentration, the uptake capacity enhanced. Detailed kinetic and equilibrium studies were done over as-synthesized MgAl-CO3 and reported 17 mg g\n-1 uptake capacity [80, 81]. The mechanism of adsorption and factors affecting adsorption of Cr (VI) in an aqueous solution onto aluminum magnesium mixed hydroxide nanoparticles were studied by Li et al. [82]. According to the\nAdsorption of Cr (VI) and Textile Dyes 245\nstudy, adsorption of Cr (VI) species onto the adsorbent is the combination of anion exchange and surface complexation processes. A former mechanism suggested that Cl- ions associated with the surface or interlayer of the adsorbent exchange with the anionic Cr (VI) species as per Equation (7):\nSur-OH2 +/Cl- + HCrO4 - → Sur-OH2 +/ HCrO4 - + Cl- (7)\nThe later mechanism involved the electrostatic interaction between the protonated surface of the adsorbent and negatively charged Cr (VI) species as mentioned in equation (8).\nSur-OH2 + + HCrO4 - → Sur-OH2 +/HCrO4 - (8)\nThe maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 112 mg g-1 at pH 4.0 and 40 °C. The nano-sized adsorbents with Mg/Al molar ratio 3 exhibited largest adsorption efficiency due to smallest average particle diameter and highest zeta potential. Ramirez et al. studied sol–gel MgAl hydrotalcite for the removal of chromate. MgAl sol–gel sample heated at 350 °C showed high adsorption capacity than 150 °C heated and unheated ones. The authors observed that with surface area the adsorption capacity increased, 350 oC calcined sample exhibits higher surface area and capacity [83]. Recently, Goh et al. reported the adsorption of Cr (VI) along with other oxyhalides and anions over MgAl LDHs prepared through fast precipitation. The nitrate and chloride-containing MgAl samples were studied. Among the anions studied, chromate was removed to a greater extent (1.2 meq g-1). The mechanism for uptake of Cr (VI) was also studied by the authors and stated that the occurrence of anion exchange or ligand exchange results in outer-sphere and inner-sphere complexes [84]. The influence of competitive anions such as nitrate, sulfate, carbonate, phosphate over adsorption of chromate, and other oxyanions were also reported by them. The influence of other co-existing anions on the adsorption of chromate had great dependence on the pH of the solution as at a different pH, the coexisting anions as well as chromate moieties will change [85]. Xu et al. carried out a column study for chromate uptake over calcined MgAl-CO3. The results showed that calcined MgAl exhibited around 44 mg g-1 uptake capacities over a range of 50–200 mg L-1. The authors claimed that the material could be regenerated and reused effectively [86]. Cocheci et al. analyzed the adsorptive capacity of ZnAl-CO3 and found that as-synthesized samples were effective for chromate removal than its calcined forms. They also stated that in the case of as-synthesized ZnAl-CO3, the chromate was not exchanged with carbonate in the interlayer, but exchanged\n246 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nat the edges of brucite-like layers [87]. Cocheci and coworkers reported uptake of Cr (VI) onto MgZnAl hydrotalcites with a varying Mg/Zn/Al ratio. The studies over calcined MgZnAl HTs showed that MgAl gave maximum chromate uptake. The results confirmed that incorporation of Zn shows no effect on chromate uptake capacity [88]. The impact of ferric iron in calcined nano-Mg/Al hydrotalcite on the adsorption of Cr (VI) from the aqueous solution was studied with respect to structure characteristics, adsorption properties, and the removal mechanism [89]. Mg/Al and Mg/Al/Fe precursors are nanosized particles and lamellar structure but the latter possessed smaller interlayer space. The mechanism of Cr (VI) removal by both the adsorbents takes place not only through intercalation but also by strong interaction between negative ions and positive external surface and inter layer ion exchange mechanism. After the reconstruction process, calcined Mg/Al/Fe showed a high adsorption rate though its adsorption capacity was less than that of calcined Mg/Al. It was because the replacement of Al3+ by Fe3+ in layered double hydroxide increased the positive surface charge by strengthening the bonds between double hydroxide layers and the carbonates in the interlayer due to which negatively charged Cr (VI) species were attracted toward it with a faster rate. On the other hand, the anions present in the interlayer were strongly attracted toward Fe3+ due to its high polarizing power than Al3+ making the ion exchange process more difficult, which decreased the adsorption capacity. Maximum theoretical saturated adsorption capacities calculated from the Langmuir isotherm model for calcined Mg/Al and Mg/Al/Fe were 85.9 and 75.4 mg g-1, respectively, at pH 3.0 and at 48 °C. Though thermodynamic parameter values revealed that the adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic, yet changes in these values indicated that the addition of Fe3+ in calcined Mg/Al will not be favorable for the adsorption process due to the nature of ferric iron, which makes the interlayer anion exchange more difficult, after the reconstruction of the structure. Therefore, the presence of Fe3+ in calcined Mg/Al hydrotalcite was unfavorable for the removal of Cr (VI) from the aqueous solution. The efficiency of Mg/Fe hydrotalcite-like compounds for the removal of Cr (VI) from an aqueous medium was studied by Das et al. [35]. Adsorption of Cr (VI) increased with the decrease in pH and it is independent of Cr (VI) speciation. Higher adsorption was observed at lower pH due to strong attraction of Cr (VI) species with the positively charged adsorbent surface. However, adsorption decreased significantly at pH ≤ 4.0 because of partial dissolution of the adsorbent at this pH. Less diffusion of ions into the pores of the adsorbent, reversible process between the adsorbed species and that in the bulk solution, and increased competition between\nAdsorption of Cr (VI) and Textile Dyes 247\nCr (VI) species and OH- ions are the facts which caused a decrease in the removal of Cr (VI) at higher pH. Kinetic studies revealed that adsorption occurred on the outer surface as well as within the pores of the adsorbent through diffusion. Hydrotalcite-like compounds containing cations such as Mg2+, Zn2+, and Al3+ with different proportions in brucite-like sheets and carbonate or benzoate anions in the inter layers were prepared by the coprecipitation method to evaluate their adsorption capacity for the removal of Cr(VI [90]. The most efficient adsorbent was obtained from the calcined Mg-Zn-Al hydrotalcite-like precursor containing interlayer CO3\n2- anions. This material exhibited greater performance for the removal of Cr (VI) from the aqueous solution in the presence of competitive anions such as Cl- and SO4\n2-. The adsorption capacity also depended on the metal content. Thus, composition of metal ions and the structural and textural properties influenced the adsorption capacity of these adsorbents. Maximum adsorption occurred at an optimal pH of 6.0. Pseudofirst-order models described well the adsorption kinetics. Mg-Al oxides adsorbed the Cr (VI) species by the reconstruction of a layered structure while Zn-containing materials adsorbed them on their surface. The difference in behavior of Zn-containing materials was due to the separation of oxide phases. Layered double hydroxides with Co/Bi = 3 were synthesized by urea hdrolysis and subjected for adsorption of Cr (VI). The asprepared Co-Bi LDH samples exhibited a maximum adsorption capacity of 277.7 mg g-1 at pH 7.0 [91]. Maximum adsorption capacity, optimum adsorption conditions such as pH, temperature, initial Cr (VI) concentration, adsorbent dose, fitted isotherm, kinetic model, thermodynamic parameters, and mechanism of adsorption for Cr (VI) onto layer double hydroxides are listed in Table 7.1."

      "text" : "Santos et al. have studied the thermal decomposition of carbonate-intercalated layered double hydroxide (ZnAl-CO3-LDH) followed by acid blue 113 adsorption [92]. The kinetics of dye adsorption on calcined-LDH shows a two-step behavior consistent with the dye adsorption on the external and internal surfaces of ongoing recovered LDH lamellar aggregates. The intercalation of anionic dye in the interlayer LDH galleries is only verified after 180 min of contact with the dye solution, contributing to merely 13% of the adsorption capacity. The adsorption isotherms follow the Langmuir model, confirming that the adsorption takes place mainly on the reconstructed LDH external surface. The LDH memory effect allows the efficient recyclability of the used LDH adsorbent.\n248 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nMagnesium aluminum layered double hydroxides were synthesized by Abdellaoui et al. through the co-precipitation method with nitrate and carbonate as an interlayer anion (MgAlNO3 and MgAlCO3) followed by the calcination of a carbonate-containing LDH sample to obtain the mixed oxide MgAl500 [93]. The resulting materials were characterized by several physicochemical techniques. Calcined and uncalcined LDHs were used as adsorbents to remove the amaranth azo dye in an aqueous solution. Adsorption results indicated that MgAl500 had a greater adsorption capacity (1.6 mmol·g−1) than non-calcined LDHs (0.8 and 0.2 mmol·g−1 for MgAlNO3 and MgAlCO3, respectively). Isotherms showed that the adsorption of the dye was consistent with the Langmuir model. The kinetic experiments of dye adsorption showed that the system reached the adsorption equilibrium in 3 h for the three adsorbents. The kinetic data fitted well with the pseudo-second-order model. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the adsorption products suggest that adsorbed amaranth anion was intercalated in the MgAlNO3 interlayers by anion exchange and in the MgAl500 by the rehydration and reconstruction process, according to the value of the basal space d003 = 17.7 Å. Whereas in the case of MgAlCO3, it was probably adsorbed on the external particle surface.\nThe influence of common inorganic anions present in the solution was also studied and a decrease in the dye removal was observed in the following order HPO4 2− > CO3 2– > SO4\n2− > Cl–. The dye desorption was tested with a carbonate and phosphate solution and it was partial in all cases. The recyclability of the used adsorbents was performed by calcinations, and the percentage of removal decreases after the first cycle for MgAlNO3 and MgAl500. The dye removal improved after the first cycle, and then decreased after the second cycle for MgAlCO3.\nA novel strategy for the preparation of poly(levodopa) functionalized MgAl-layered double hydroxide (PDOPA-f-LDH) was developed by Zhao et al. based on the modified mussel-inspired chemistry [94]. The utilization of PDOPA-f-LDH for the removal of methylene blue (MB) from an aqueous solution was also examined. Taken advantage of the self-polymerization of levodopa (DOPA) in an alkaline solution and the strong affinity of catechol groups to the substrate surface, the LDH was covered homogeneously by a layer of polymer coating of DOPA, leading to the functionalization toward LDH. The structure, surface morphology, thermos-stability, and elemental composition of as-prepared PDOPA-f-LDH were investigated by the transmission electron microscope, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Besides, the surface charge of the PDOPAf-LDH was also investigated using zeta potential. The effects of various\nAdsorption of Cr (VI) and Textile Dyes 249\nparameters, including contact time, initial MB concentration, solution pH, and temperature, on the adsorption of MB onto PDOPA-f-LDH were systematically investigated. Results show that the adsorption capacity of functionalized LDH at 25 °C could reach up to 102 mg g-1, which is much higher than that of pure LDH under the same experimental conditions. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm of MB adsorption were studied in batch experiments. The pseudo-second-order model is found to be the best to describe the adsorption kinetics. The isotherm result shows that the Freundlich isotherm is the better-fit-isotherm model to represent the equilibrium data. The values of thermodynamic parameters, including enthalpy change ΔH0, entropy change ΔS0, and Gibbs free energy change ΔG0, were also determined. All the ΔG0 values are negative; the ΔH0 and ΔS0 values of PDOPA-f-LDH were −7.824 kJ mol−1 and −0.01562 kJ mol−1 K−1, respectively. The activation energy of system (Ea) is calculated as 24.69 kJ mol−1. The fact suggests that the MB adsorption on PDOPA-f-LDH is a spontaneous and exothermic process. These obtained results indicate that the prepared PDOPA-f-LDH could be used as an interesting adsorbent with great potential to adsorb the cationic dyeing pollutants from aqueous media.\nThe NiFe layered double hydroxides with a different mole ratio of Ni/ Fe (4:1, 3:1, 7:3, and 1:1) were prepared through a simple co-precipitation method by Lu et al. [95]. The adsorption performance was evaluated by the removal of methyl orange (MO) dye and hexavalent chromium (VI) heavy metal ion as shown in Figure 7.12. It is found that Ni4Fe1-LDH can remove\n250 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nmore than 92% of MO in 10 min at the 10 mg L–1 MO initial concentration, and 97% of Cr (VI) in 1 h at 4 mg L–1 Cr2O7\n2− initial concentration. The saturated adsorption capacity of Ni4Fe1-LDH is found to be as large as 205.76 mg g–1 for MO and 26.78 mg g–1 for Cr (VI). The adsorption behavior of this new adsorbent is fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicative of a monolayer and chemical adsorption that synergistically originates from the exchangeable anion mechanism and layer charge density. Due to the excellent removal capacity of MO and Cr (VI), the NiFe-LDHs could be a promising adsorbent for wastewater treatment.\nAhmed et al. adopted a new approach for the removal of indigo carmine blue (IC) dye which is extensively used in jeans manufacture and was successfully performed on novel mesoporous (LDH) nanoparticles prepared by the sol–gel route using CTAB as a shape and pore directing agent [96]. A successful adsorption of IC on LDH nanoparticles of surface area = 85.6 m2 g-1 at various pH with a maximum adsorption capacity of 62.8 mg g-1 at pH = 9.5. The Langmuir model is more favorable to describe the adsorption of IC rather than the Freundlich model, which reflects the preferential formation of monolayer on the surface of LDH. Both film diffusion and the intraparticle diffusion affect the dye adsorption. The values of enthalpy change for (ΔH) and (ΔS) are +28.18 and +0.118 kJ mol-1, respectively, indicating that the removal process is endothermic. The results indicated that LDH nanoparticles conserved a good activity even after five consecutive cycles of reuse. The results suggest that mesoporous LDH nanoparticles are considered a potential novel adsorbent for the remediation of wastewater containing IC.\nA series of hydroxyl ammonium ionic liquids/layered double hydroxide intercalation composites (ILs/LDHs) were synthesized and adopted to study the adsorption process of anionic dye reactive orange 5 from aqueous solutions by Zhou et al. [97]. The experimental results showed that the maximum adsorption capability of ILs/LDHs reached up to 300.9 mg g-1, which was obviously higher than that of LDHs. The adsorption isotherms were well described by the Freundlich model in the presence of the LDHs and ILs/LDHs. The adsorption kinetics followed the pseudosecond-order kinetic model. The negative value of ΔG° and the positive value of ΔH° indicated a spontaneous and endothermic nature of reactive orange 5 adsorption. For ILs/LDHs (b), desorption percentages were 57.91%, 46.67%, and 37.34% in each cycle, respectively.\nLi et al. have reported a novel magnetic polydopamine (PDA)–LDH (MPL) bifunctional material, which is fabricated by an easy and green approach for the simultaneous removal of potentially toxic metals and\nAdsorption of Cr (VI) and Textile Dyes 251\nanionic dyes [98]. In a mono-component system, the removal behaviors showed heterogeneous removal capacities of 75.01, 624.89, and 584.56 mg g−1 for Cu (II), methyl orange (MO), and Congo red (CR), respectively. Interestingly, the presence of CR and MO enhanced the removal of Cu (II) significantly in the Cu (II)–dye binary system. However, the presence of Cu (II) had no significant effect on dyes. Such a green and facile synthesis method, efficient removal performance, and superior reusability suggest that the MPL assemblies have a practical application potential for integrative and efficient treatment of coexisting toxic pollutants.\nThe “batch” method for evaluating the adsorption of Sunset Yellow FCF food dye into a CaAl-LDH-NO3-layered double hydroxide (LDH) system was investigated by Pereira de Sa et al. [99]. The CaAl-LDH-NO3 was coprecipitated at variable pH and characterized by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and scan electron microscopy. Adsorption experiments were carried out as a function of pH, contact time, and dye concentration. The results showed that the pH affects the adsorbent surface charge and the degree of anionic dye dissociation. The effective pH range for dye removal was between 4.0 and 10.0. A lower pH potentially causes dissolution of CaAl-LDH-NO3. The Langmuir equation adequately describes the equilibrium data. The best-fits showed a maximum adsorption of 398.41 mg g-1.\nThe Mg/Fe LDH with carbonate interaction and its calcined product (CLDH) were synthesized by Guo et al. [100] and used as adsorbents for the removal of acid brown 14 (AB 14) from aqueous solutions. The synthesized CLDH was efficient and had a much higher adsorption capability of 370.0 mg g-1 for AB 14 compared with that of the LDH, 41.7 mg g-1. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the CLDH before and after the adsorption demonstrated that the adsorption was significantly enhanced by reconstruction of its original layered structure in the presence of AB 14 with the memory effect. It was found that the adsorption isotherms were well described by the Langmuir model for both the LDH and the CLDH with a correlation coefficient (R2) > 0.99, and the adsorption kinetics of AB 14 on these two adsorbents followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The results indicated that the calcined Mg/Fe-layered double hydroxide is an efficient adsorbent for the treatment of waste water with a high concentration of anionic dyes.\nNi-Al-layered double hydroxide (Ni-Al LDH) was synthesized by the co-precipitation method from their nitrate salts and utilized as an adsorbent for the removal of methyl orange (MO) dye from its aqueous solution by Monash et al. [101]. The synthesized Ni-Al LDH was characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and\n252 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nN2 adsorption–desorption analysis. Batch adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted with methyl orange dye at three different temperatures (30 °C, 40 °C, and 50 °C). Adsorption isotherm data were fitted with Langmuir, Freundlich, and Redlich–Peterson models. It was found that the Langmuir and Redlich–Peterson isotherm models best described the adsorption of MO on calcined Ni-Al LDH. The experimental results revealed that the increase in temperature increases the adsorption capacity of MO on the calcined Ni-Al LDH adsorbent. The maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 5.7 × 10−4 mol g−1 at 50 °C. The influence of pH on the adsorption of MO dye indicated that the adsorbent has good structural stability in the studied pH range. Thermodynamic studies authenticated that the adsorption of MO dye on calcined Ni-Al LDH was spontaneous, endothermic, and an entropy-driven process.\nThe Mg-Al-CO3-LDH with a Mg 2+/Al3+ molar ratio of 2 was prepared via the co-precipitation method at a constant pH of 9–10 and used to remove three red dyes by the batch adsorption method [102]. The results showed Mg-Al-LDH were well crystallized and can adsorb the red dyes effectively. The optimal adsorbent dosage and contact time were 1.0 g and 60 min, respectively. Adsorbed amount hardly changed when pH < 10. The adsorption kinetics fit the pseudo-second-order kinetic models well and isotherms correspond to the Langmuir model strictly. All the relevant mechanisms were studied and manifested as anion exchange and also electrostatic attraction for CR. Maximum adsorption capacity, optimum adsorption condition such as pH, temperature, initial dye concentration, adsorbent dose, fitted isotherm, kinetic model, thermodynamic parameters, and mechanism of adsorption for dyes onto layer double hydroxides are listed in Table 7.2."

Modification of their surfaces was carried out to enhance the surface area and number of active surface sites and, hence uptake capacity. Protonated surfaces or protonated modified surfaces of nanomaterials adsorbed Cr (VI) species through electrostatic attraction. In addition to this, surface functional groups such as -OH, -CO-, etc. reduced Cr (VI) to Cr (III). Methods of preparation were responsible for the formation of nanostructutres with a high surface area and uniform particle size which enhanced the uptake capacity.\nAdsorption of Cr (VI) and Textile Dyes 253\nIntroduction of nanoporous architecture, increasing the surface area, and developing layered functional nanomaterials show promising dye adsorption capacities. Mesoporous silica materials having long range ordered porosity, intraparticle mesoporosity, and high effective surface area favor enhanced adsorption (mostly fitted with the Langmuir model) with second-order kinetics. Titanate nanotubes with their unique arryed nanostructures provide higher surface area and large pore volumes for better adsorption of noxious dyes. Moreover, the layered fuctional structures of LDH favors enhanced adsorption in its interlayer spacings."

      "text" : "Dyes are major organic compounds of effluents discharged from industries such as textile, pulp and paper, cosmetic and pharmaceuticals, food and packaging, etc. [1, 2]. Methylene blue (MB), that is, methylthioninium chloride (Figure 8.1), is a member of the thiazine class of dyes with many applications [3–5] which was first prepared by  Heinrich Caro in 1876 [6]. The toxic effects from thiazine dyes have been previously investigated and documented [7]. Severe toxic effects (1%) on Iris epithelium and corneal endothelium [11], and toxic effects on human luteal cells [12], on fetus [13], and on erythroleukemic cells [14] are only few examples of the harmful impacts on living organisms when exposed to MB. Hence, the toxicity and carcinogenic effects of this type of dyes raise major concerns about human health and also about the safety of aquatic environments where dye-contaminated effluents might end up [8–10].\nThe removal of MB from industrial effluents is an important environmental issue because most of the conventional biological, physical, and chemical treatment methods are not able to efficiently degrade this compound [15]. In this context, exploring efficient methods and optimizing its operating conditions for MB removal are goals of high significance. The application of engineered nanomaterials (NMs) has proved to be a successful route for the removal of MB dye from contaminated environments when appropriate conditions are met. Recent studies have shown that the performance of NMs is highly conditioned by the experimental conditions, that is, contact time, pH, and temperature among others, the removal efficiency being very dependent on the combination of used conditions. In addition, the application of additional measures such as UV irradiation has shown the ability to improve the final removal efficiency when assisted by NMs. Table 8.1 summarizes literature data supporting these findings. Despite this pool of knowledge, there is still a need to find out the optimum conditions under which maximum removal efficiency can be achieved under reasonable investments of time, materials, and input energy.\nUltrasonic Synthesis of Zero Valent Iron Nanoparticles 263 Ta bl e 8 .1 P er fo rm an ce o f n an om at er ia ls us ed fo r t he re m ov al o f M B fr om d ye so lu tio n.

Within this context, iron oxides such as magnetite (Fe3O4) [16, 17], hematite (Fe2O3) [18–20], maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) [21, 22], and iron hydroxides such as lepidocrocite (α-FeOOH) [23] are of particular interest to degrade and remove various types of environmental contaminants. Zero valent iron (ZVI) is another type of iron-based material with a potential to be widely adopted in real-scale applications as an effective, non-toxic, and low-cost alternative for conventional clean-up technologies [24, 25]. The application of micro-sized ZVI particles in permeable reactive barriers [26, 27] is a good example of the utilization of this material as a well-known strategy for the treatment of highly polluted ground waters. However, ZVI particles, if used as nanosized particles (nZVI), may provide a significantly larger surface area-to-volume ratio, and also a higher surface energy which result in significant improvement of their reactivity toward contaminants [28–36]. In addition, various attempts have been made to enhance the properties of these NMs in terms of specific surface area (SSA), crystallinity, etc. [29–31]. However, there is still field for improvements. For instance, the simultaneous enhancement of nanomaterial properties such as crystallinity and surface area and the optimization of nZVI synthesis conditions still remain to be explored.\nFor optimizing the MB removal efficiency, nZVI synthesized with enhanced surface area and crystalline structure via a combined liquid phase reduction–ultrasonic irradiation technique is proposed here. Also, the MB removal can be maximized by correlating the conditions allowing optimum degradation of MB with the properties of the used NMs. The reactivity of the synthesized nZVI toward MB can be traced with a photometric analysis which allows us to identify the mechanisms involved as well."

Mechanical overhead stirring (at 250 rpm) with IKA Eurostar 40 stirrer is utilized to continuously stir the reaction medium. Certain amounts of a sodium borohydride solution (0.91 g of sodium borohydride dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water) are injected in 30 mL of an ethanol/deionized water solution (24 mL of ethanol + 6 mL of deionized water) containing the precursor (0.81 g of FeCl3.6H2O) at room temperature.

      "text" : "A photometric assay is employed for assessing the concentration of MB in synthetic solutions. Adsorption spectra of MB solutions with different concentrations are detailed in Figure 8.7. As observed, two absorption maxima of MB are detected at 610 and 664 nm [49–52], their intensity difference being attenuated as MB concentration increases. In this study, the conversion of MB to any colorless products such as MLB is termed as discoloration whereas the irreversible conversion of MB to products such as CO2 or H2O is referred as MB degradation [53].\nIn order to study the extent of MB discoloration using nZVI particles prepared under ultrasonic irradiation and also the mechanisms involved\nUltrasonic Synthesis of Zero Valent Iron Nanoparticles 271\nin the process, assays at various pHs of the reaction medium, ranging from 4 to 10, are important in order to cover the effects of pH variation.\nThe assay at pH = 4 is used to assess the effects of acidic conditions on the process of MB discoloration. Under this condition, the percentage of color removal (here identified as the percentage of reduction of the adsorption intensity measured at 664 nm) from the solution reached only 29% after 30 min of reaction and the pH slightly increased to 4.1. Moreover, after re-collecting the nanoparticles from the reaction medium, the solution becomes rapidly re-colored suggesting that there should be a reversible reaction for the removal of MB under acidic conditions where the MB molecules are not attached to the surface of the NMs considering the zeta potential of the synthesized nZVIUI .\nMB is widely applied for optical oxygen sensing especially in the food industry [54, 55]. It is well known that MB is reduced to leuco methylene blue (LMB) which is a colorless compound in the absence of oxygen. This compound is readily re-oxidized (to MB) by introducing oxygen to the system [56]. When MB is subjected to the treatment with nZVI particles, it is proposed here that the surface layer of ZVI particles undergoes oxidation according to equation (2) [57–60]:\nFe Fe e0 2 2 (2)\nThe released electrons are subsequently used to reduce the MB to LMB, under acidic conditions. A schematic of the involved mechanism is presented in Figure 8.8.\n272 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nAccording to Figure 8.5, the point of zero charge (PZC) of the prepared nZVI particles is reached approximately at pH 8. Below this pH, the surface of nZVIUI particles is positively charged, while above this pH it is negatively charged. Hence, under acidic conditions, repulsive electrostatic interactions between ZVI particles and the positive ions of MB do not favor the adsorption of MB on the surface of ZVI particles. Therefore, the hypothetic contribution of MB adsorption on ZVI particles for the chemical pathway of MB discoloration is considered negligible within the considered acidic pH window.\nAs referred, rapid re-coloration of the solution takes place suggesting that under acidic condition LMB does not degrade to simpler intermediate compounds or to final products (CO2+H2O) [61]. This suggestion is supported by the photometric results obtained after 30 min of reaction presented in Figure 8.9. The results show that the difference between the two maximum absorbances at 290 and 664nm becomes enhanced with the reaction time, being this considered as an evidence for the decrease of MB in the reaction medium. Also the intensity of the adsorption peak at 243 nm which is attributed to LMB [62] becomes enhanced with the reaction time, in line with the reasoning here proposed.\nUltrasonic Synthesis of Zero Valent Iron Nanoparticles 273"

The photometric results obtained in a 30 min time interval are presented in Figure 8.10. As observed in Figure 8.9 (a), an apparent effective removal of MB is observed after 5 min of reaction time (blue line), in line with the loss of blue color observed after 5 min. During this short period, the pH of the medium increased slightly to ~8.5. A shoulder at 664 nm (Figure 8.10) indicates that the discoloration of MB was almost achieved but not complete. The shoulder does disappear after 30 min of reaction (Figure 8.10 (b)) (green line), thus indicating that a 100% discoloration of MB was achieved (Figure 8.11). However, a narrow peak observed at"

We also observed a decrease in the LMB peak at 250 nm denoting the transformation of the existing LMB to MB in the presence of oxygen in the medium.\nWhen the pH of the medium gets close to the PZC of nZVI particles, MB gets more easily adsorbed on the surface of nZVI particles as the repulsive forces between the surface of the nanoparticles and MB molecules are now much weaker or inexistent. Under these conditions, it is assumed that MB\n274 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\ncomplexes are formed on nZVI particle surface [61] being very susceptible to chemical attack by species originated at the surface layers of the nZVI particles. According to equations (3) to (7) which describe the reaction possibilities of the nZVI particle surface layers, namely, with the surrounding H2O molecules, H radicals are generated which may induce the cleavage of the MB molecules [63–66]. This can be suggested as a main reason for the higher efficiency of the MB degradation and cleavage at pH = 7.5\nUltrasonic Synthesis of Zero Valent Iron Nanoparticles 275\ncompared to acidic conditions.

      "text" : "Figure 8.13 presents the results of the discoloration of MB carried on at an initial pH of 10. As observed, the extent of the discoloration reached only 26% after 5 min (blue line) which is much lower than that recorded at initial pH = 7.5. After 15 min of reaction (red line), the discoloration of MB reached 61% and it increased further to 100% after 30 min of reaction (green line).\nUnder high pH values, an extensive adsorption of MB on the surface of the used NMs, helped by electrostatic attractive forces, can be expected.\n276 Nanomaterials in the Wet Processing of Textiles\nSuch adsorption provides a favorable condition for the degradation of MB. A lower removal of MB under basic conditions as compared to quasineutral conditions can be attributed to the mechanisms involved in the discoloration of MB in an alkaline medium. According to equation (4), the production of H+ is a key step for the generation of hydrogen radicals which can subsequently degrade and remove MB from the solution. Nonetheless, the presence of abundant OH- under basic conditions may play a scavenging role leading to the readily consumption of the produced H+ near the surface of the nZVI particles. Hence, the reactions for the cleavage of MB are restricted.\nIt has been well documented in the literature that the performance of NMs for the removal of persistent phenolic compounds increases under acidic conditions [67–70]. Most of the phenolic compounds such as chlorophenols are negatively charged which facilitates their attachment to the surface of NMs positively charged as frequently observed in acidic media. Therefore, it can be suggested that the better efficiency of NMs under acidic pH for the removal of such contaminants is probably associated with the formation of pollutants-NMs surface complexes which might be more effective players in the process of pollutants degradation than the release of electrons to the reaction medium by the reduction of Fe nanoparticles with subsequent chemical attack to pollutants.\nUltrasonic Synthesis of Zero Valent Iron Nanoparticles 277 Ta bl e 8 .2 S om e re ce nt st ud ie s f or th e re m ov al o f M B us in g nZ V I m at er ia ls.

So, it can be anticipated that the available surface area of the NMs is a key factor, because it can critically determine their efficiency when dealing with complex organic pollutants. The results of this study also indicate that the efficiency of the reactions that occurred in the bulk solution (not on the surface of the NMs) is negligible. So, limiting the release of electrons from the nZVI materials to the reaction medium for the purpose of increasing the lifetime of nZVI particles will probably not affect their efficiency.\nTable 8.2 provides the results of some recent studies for the removal of MB using ZVI NMs comparing the efficiency of Fe nanoparticles toward the discoloration of MB, under different operating conditions. In most of the cases, the characteristics of the used NMs have not been fully provided in the respective reports. In the present study, a very high efficiency of the NMs for the degradation of MB can be attributed to the enhanced properties (high crystallinity and large specific surface area) of the used nanoparticles which provide a good condition for the rapid degradation of MB in a short period of time (100% discoloration in 5 min) under appropriate pH conditions."

Such NMs present an efficient performance regarding the degradation of MB and discoloration of MB solutions. The pH of the solution medium is a critical parameter for determining the MB removal efficiency of the synthesized NMs. While acidic pH allows achieving 30% discoloration of MB, quasi-neutral conditions of pH = 7.5 permit the complete removal of the dye color. The properties of the NMs including zeta potential, size, specific surface area, and crystallinity are the main factors determining the efficiency of the NMs for environmental clean-up purposes."

In recent years, fine materials that are produced using nanotechnology have been used in the textile production process. Production of functional textiles is the main purpose of using nanomaterials or nanocomponents on natural fibers such as cotton, wool, silk and synthetic fibers such as polyester, nylon, and acrylic, as they possess various properties such as light resistance, antimicrobial, self-cleaning, fire retardant, etc. Different kinds of nanostructures are used in textiles. For example, carbon and copper nanoparticles or polymeric nanostructures such as polypyrrol and polyaniline as electro conductive agents; aluminum, zinc oxides, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for increasing durability of fibers; antimicrobial agents such as silver, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide (TiO2); moisture absorbent agents such as TiO2; selfcleaning nanostructures such as CNT, TiO2, and fluoroacrylates; UV protection agents as TiO2 and ZnO; nano porous structures such as silicon dioxide or carbon black in order to improve dye ability of fibers; and many advanced properties such as heat conducting or insulating or electromagnetic shielding via introducing CNT or vanadium dioxide and indium tin oxide to fibers, respectively. In this chapter, the development of using nanostructures to improve the properties of textiles is discussed. For this reason, nanostructures used in finishing processes are presented, separately.",
