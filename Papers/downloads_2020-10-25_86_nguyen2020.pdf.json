The participation of AlN in removing oxygenbearing species (i.e., TiO2) has been found to be explicable for boosting the sinterability of TiC. TiN was formed in-situ as a product of the chemical reaction between AlN and TiO2 compounds, dissolving within the TiC matrix and producing Ti(C,N) solid solution. Moreover, the co-addition of AlN and GNPs resulted in the creation of Al2OC as another in-situ phase. This compound together with the initially introduced additives activated grain refinement and dispersion strengthening mechanisms, uplifting the flexural strength of TiC by ~35% (standing at 703 MPa). Although the intragranular fracture was the predominant wear mode in the monolithic TiC, the synergetic impacts of AlN and GNPs additives altered the prevailing mode to intergranular."

      "text" : "Titanium carbide (TiC) materials own good corrosion resistance, low friction coefficient to metals, high thermal and chemical stability, high thermal conductivity, low neutron absorption cross-section, high electrical conductivity (30 × 106 Ω cm), superior melting point (~ 3260 °C), and high hardness (~ 30 GPa) [1–5]. Because of such qualities, TiC has been considerably used in machining materials and cutting tools. Besides the applications above, this unique substance has also found a solid place in advanced industries, e.g., aerospace, nuclear, automotive, defense, etc. [6–10]. On the one hand, the pure TiC possesses some demerits, i.e., low fracture toughness and low thermal shock resistance, which limit its applications [11–13]. On the other hand, the manufacturing of TiC compounds, especially in the\nmonolithic form, is challenging owing to some limitations, including poor self-diffusion coefficient, and powerful covalent bonding [14–18]. To address the technical difficulties, using high sintering temperatures can lead to some serious aftermaths, such as excessive grain growth and poor mechanical characteristics. Consequently, other solutions should be considered [19–23].\nOne of the potential approaches to hinder the grain growth over the sintering, and simultaneously reach high-quality parts is implementing spark plasma sintering (SPS) method instead of the conventional powder metallurgy technique [24–30]. SPS is an advanced sintering route, in which external uniaxial pressure is applied to the powder over the process [31–36]. The working temperature in this novel method is relatively low; furthermore, the densification occurs in a short time compared to other processes like hot-pressing and pressureless sintering\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrmhm.2020.105331 Received 20 June 2020; Received in revised form 10 July 2020; Accepted 11 July 2020\n⁎ Corresponding author at: Duy Tan University, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam ⁎⁎ Corresponding author at: Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. ⁎⁎⁎ Corresponding author at: University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, Namin, Iran. ⁎⁎⁎⁎ Corresponding author at: University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, E3B 5A1, Canada.

By contrast, some researchers have focused on finding a suitable additive(s) to uplift the qualifications of TiC-based ceramics. Ceramic additives, e.g., AlN [47], BN [48], TiN [49], SiC [50], ZrN [51], SiC [45], WC [52,53], TiB2 [54], diamond [55], graphite [56,57], graphene [58], carbon black [59], etc., and metallic binders, e.g., Fe [60,61], Co [62], Mo [63], Cr [64], Ni [65,66], etc., are among the most common secondary phases that have been studied already.\nIn recent decades, quite a few researches have been accomplished on the impacts of different additives on refining the microstructure of TiC materials to improve the mechanical features, especially strength [67–69]. Various carbonaceous phases were among the frequent additives chosen by scientists. The effects of introducing 5 wt% of three allotropic forms of carbon, i.e., diamond, graphene, and graphite, on the qualifications of TiC were studied [55,56,58]. It was reported that the introduction of graphite led to a higher increase in the relative density of the SPSed specimens compared to others. Moreover, the most significant flexural strength of 633 MPa was attained for the same composite. Carbon fiber as reinforcement was investigated in the TiC system by Song et al. [70]. Although the addition of carbon fiber slightly reduced the relative density of TiC, its influence on the flexural strength and fracture toughness of hot-pressed samples were considerable. In brief, these features for the monolithic TiC were measured around 470 MPa and 4 MPa.m1/2, respectively, while comprising the carbon fiber additive increased these values by ~25% and 55%. On the other hand, different nitrides as additives were also introduced to the TiC system. Pazhouhanfar et at. [49] added 5 wt% TiN to TiC, reporting a gentle enhancement in the relative density of the as-sintered ceramic. Despite this improvement, the flexural strength of the doped sample experienced a drop by 11% in comparison with that of the monolithic sample. Shaddel et al. [48] carried out similar research on the h-BN additive, reporting roughly similar results to those for the TiN. Nevertheless, Fattahi et al. [47] reached outstanding outcomes with adding AlN to the TiC matrix compared to the other nitrides mentioned above. The addition of such an additive not only boost the sinterability of TiC, obtaining a fully dense sample, but also improved the flexural strength of TiC by ~36%.\nAccording to the beneficial role of both graphene and AlN on the strength of the TiC-based composites, the synergetic effect of them was investigated in this research paper. For this aim, four samples of monolithic TiC, TiC-5 wt% graphene nano-platelets (GNP), TiC-5 wt% AlN, and TiC-5 wt% GNP-5 wt% AlN were fabricated in this investigation by SPS route at 1900 °C. All specimens characterized by electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry, and their mechanical features, including hardness, flexural strength, and coefficient of friction, were assessed and compared together."

The general information associated with these substances is exhibited in Table. 1. Initially, the needed powders to prepare the\ncompositions presented in Table 2 were carefully weighted. Next, an ultrasonic facility was implemented to disperse the powder mixtures individually for 30 min in ethanol. For an additional mixing as well as the removal of the ethanol medium, the resulting slurries were heated at a temperature of 120 °C for 120 min on a hot-plate armed with a magnetic shaker. After dehumidifying the slurries at 100 °C for 24 h using an oven, an agate mortar was utilized to smash the dried slurries. Subsequently, homogenous fine powder mixtures were attained by passing the crushed powders through a 100-mesh sieve. In the following, the pure TiC and other prepared mixtures were separately loaded into a die out of graphite with a 3 cm internal diameter, which was lined by a graphite foil to minimize the chemical reaction between the samples and the mold. Finally, all samples were sintered at the same sintering conditions (1900 °C, 10 min, 40 MPa) using an SPS machine (Nanozint 10i, KPF Co., Iran). For a better perspective, the manufacturing steps for the TiC-AlN-GNP specimen is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1."

An X-ray diffractometer (XRD: PW3710 X, Philips) was used for identifying the available phases in the SPSed specimens. The microstructural investigation was performed using a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM: S8000, Tescan) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS: DXP-X10P) for elemental assessment. Two computer programs, named ImageJ (Ver. 1.52a, Wayne Rasband) and HSC (Ver. 6, Outotec), were utilized for quantitative metallography Measurements and thermodynamic studies, respectively. A universal testing device (STM-250) was implemented to quantify the flexural strength of the standard samples (3 × 4 × 28 mm3 with a span length of 15 mm) via a three-point bending method. The Vickers hardness of each ceramic was measured as an average of six indentations applied on the polished surface using a 100 g load. Finally, A WTH pin-on-disk machine (dry environment, ambient temperature, load = 49 N, and sliding velocity ~ 0.05 m/s) was utilized to study the abrasion behavior specimens, based on ASTM standard G99. In this test, a spherical pin out of tungsten carbide (1 mm in diameter) slid on a circle (15 mm in diameter) for around 450 m."

      "text" : "Fig. 2 presents the electron microscopy images and XRD patterns of the starting materials, i.e., TiC, AlN, and graphene nano-platelets (GNPs). As is clear, the particle sizes and morphologies of these powders are in agreement with the datasheet provided by the suppliers (Table 1). Also, no unwanted compound was identified in the XRD results, manifesting the high purity of these substances.\nBased on the procedure explained in the experimental section, the relative density values of the as-sintered ceramics were calculated, in which the results are illustrated in a bar chart (Fig. 3). The monolithic TiC reached a relative density just over 95%; however, comprising 5 wt\n% GNPs had no evident impact on the sinterability of such a composite, attaining a roughly similar relative density value. By contrast, the addition of the same weight percentage of the AlN additive led to a relative density of higher than 100% in the TA specimen. The reason for obtaining the value over 100% for this ceramic is because of our initial assumption based on occurring no chemical interactions among the available compounds. For instance, when a heavier compound forms as a result of interacting between two lighter phases, this problem would arise [71,72]. Nevertheless, this result indicates that possibly a fully dense composite was attained over the SPS process, which its validity will be checked through the micrographs in the following. The synergetic influence of both AlN and GNPs on the relative density of TiC is approximately similar to the TA sample, which is in harmony with the other relative densities. As the thermodynamic study may be beneficial\nin justifying the obtained results for the relative density, and also in understanding the sintering mechanisms, such evaluations will be debated subsequently.\nThe XRD analyses of all SPSed ceramics are presented in Fig. 4. According to the pattern associated with the monolithic TiC, it can be seen that the SPS of this sample resulted in the formation of non-stoichiometric TiCx, along with the stoichiometric TiC. Also, a peak at 2θ ~ 91° was identified for the graphitized carbon, which is in agreement with the generation of TiCx in this specimen. In other words, it seems that some carbon atoms have left their octahedral spots, precipitating at the grain boundaries of the matrix [73–76]. Depositing carbon at such places not only hinders grain growth but also can be advantageous in the depletion of TiC particles from oxygen-bearing species, i.e., TiO2 in this case. The possible reaction attributing to this\nphenomenon is exhibited in Eq. (1), with a negative Gibbs free energy at 1900 °C (Fig. 5). It seems that the advancement of such an equation improved the sinterability of TiC over the sintering process.\n+ = +TiO 3C TiC 2CO (g)2 (1)\nThe XRD pattern of the TG sample containing 5 wt% GNPs is roughly similar to that of the monolithic TiC. Nevertheless, an exclusive carbon peak appeared at 2θ ~ 26.4° in this sample. Based on the discussion above, it is anticipated that introducing GNPs should lead to a higher value of relative density. However, the relative density of the TG sample, according to Fig. 2, is roughly equal to that of the monolithic TiC. A possible explanation for this outcome could be due to the agglomeration of a proportion of the added GNPs and gas entrapment between their platelets. This occurrence possibly negated the beneficial role of GNPs on the grain refining of the TiC matrix.\nThe introduction of the AlN additive, by contrast, may contribute more to depleting the TiO2 surface oxide, boosting the sintering behavior of TiC. This phenomenon may progress based on the reaction presented in Eq. (2), in which the in-situ TiN and Al2O3 would form together with a gaseous phase (N2). The Gibbs free energy of this reaction is highly negative at 1900 °C (Fig. 5), indicating its favorability in the TiC-AlN system. On the one hand, the in-situ formed TiN has this opportunity to dissolve within the TiC matrix, forming Ti(C,N) solid solution [49], and on the other hand, the N2 gas may interact with the Al2O3 phase wherever free carbon is available (Eq. (3)). The ΔG° of such a reaction at 1900 °C is−72 kJ (Fig. 5), which endorsed its feasibility in the current system. The formation of these ultra-fine in-situ compounds, indeed, may have a great impact on strengthening this composite, which will be discussed in the relevant end.\n+ = + +6TiO 8AlN 6TiN 4Al O N (g)2 2 3 2 (2)\n+ + = +Al O 3C N (g) 2AlN 3CO(g)2 3 2 (3)\nThe XRD pattern of the TAG specimen is roughly the cumulative version of those for TA and TG ceramics. However, two tiny peaks related to the Al2OC phase appeared in the XRD result of this composite, which was absent in the previous specimens' patterns. Such a phase, as shown in Eq. (4), is a result of chemical interaction between carbon and Al2O3. The formation of this phase was also reported in the ZrB2-SiCAlN system [77]. The gaseous phase has this chance to leave the system thanks to the applied vacuum over the sintering process. Besides, the insitu produced compound, namely Al2OC, can participate in strengthening the prepared composite.\n+ = +Al O 3C Al OC 2CO(g)2 3 2 (4)"

      "heading" : "3.2. Microstructural study",
      "text" : "The electron microscopy images of the SPSed ceramics are indicated in Fig. 6. The microstructure of the monolithic TiC, as shown in Fig. 6a, is comprised of the TiC/TiCx matrix, in which some dark areas can be observed. Some of these zones are associated with the remaining porosity; however, some others represent the deposited carbon from the TiC matrix. More information about this phenomenon may be found in our previous papers [78–82]. The micrograph of the TA ceramic is displayed in Fig. 6b. According to the discussion, the matrix in such a sample should be consist of Ti(C,N) solid solution that remaining AlN, along with the precipitated carbon, is dispersed within it. These secondary phases, as clear in this micrograph, are homogeneously distributed all over the matrix, which can be beneficial in strengthening [83–89]. It is also worth mentioning that some pore-like cavities can be seen in the polished surface, which is, in fact, associated with the pulled-out secondary phases during the sample's polishing. On the other hand, the addition of 5 wt% GNPs to the TiC, led to the emergence of some relatively large carbonaceous grains within the matrix (Fig. 6c). It seems that a proportion of the introduced GNPs agglomerated during\npreparing powders mixtures, creating such grains [90]. Moreover, based on this micrograph, it is apparent that GNPs could not provide a good bonding with the matrix, so when a crack reaches the interface can be deflected easily, which results in an enhancement in toughening the sample. Finally, the electron microscopy image related to the TAG\nceramic containing both additives is presented in Fig. 6d. According to the discussion above, a Ti(C,N) solid solution matrix is anticipated with some AlN and carbonaceous phases in it. The EDS map analyses from the polished surface of the TAG ceramic were accomplished to validate the presumption above (Fig. 7). It is observable in this image that the\ndark phase is associated with the carbon, while the dark-grey compounds are remaining AlN. Besides, the map related to nitrogen manifests that this element is available all over the microstructure except where carbonaceous phases are agglomerated, verifying the formation of Ti(C,N) solid solution in the places other than where carbon is accumulated. The EDS line analysis is also shown in Fig. 8b, which indicates the alternations of elemental concentration along the yellow line indicated in Fig. 8a. This result is also in agreement with our earlier outcomes, i.e., the presence of the remaining AlN, and the Ti(C,N) solid solution in the microstructure of the TAG sample.\nThe fractographs of the specimens are exhibited in Fig. 9. The electron microscopy image attributing to the monolithic specimen (Fig. 9a) contains some remaining porosity, which endorses the result obtained for the relative density (Fig. 2). The majority of these pores are associated with the unclosed triple junctions; however, some of them are intragranular pores formed owing to the migration of grain boundaries over the grain coarsening. As shown by a white arrow, the precipitated carbon is also detectable in this fractograph. The significant impact of the AlN additive on eliminating the remaining porosity can be seen in Fig. 9b. According to this image, AlN was successful in filling the pores and closing the triple pockets. Also, as AlN contributed to the reduction of the TiO2 oxide layer, lower remaining porosity, smaller grains, and more remaining carbonaceous phase can be observed in this FESEM image. By contrast, although the addition of GNPs to the TiC matrix was effectively prohibited the formation of intragranular pores (compared to the monolithic sample), the remaining porosity was roughly equal to the pure TiC, endorsing the relative density's measurement. In the co-doped ceramic, despite the possible free space between the platelets of the graphene, no remaining porosity was identifiable. It is also worthy of note that both intergranular and transgranular fracture modes occurred in all SPSed ceramics, which is beneficial in strengthening them [91–98]. In terms of grain size, as illustrated in Fig. 10 in a bar chart, though introducing additives led to reducing grain size in all composite ceramics, the lowest values were calculated for the TG and TAG samples. The value of the TG sample was slightly lower than that of the TAG ceramic, which could be because of partially progressing of the consolidation stage in the former. In other words, the grains in TAG ceramic had more chance to grow."

      "heading" : "3.3. Mechanical features",
      "text" : "The Vickers hardness of samples is graphically presented in Fig. 11. As is clear, the highest value of hardness (~ 3130 HV0.1 kg) was attained for the specimens without any additive. Although the impact of adding 5 wt% AlN on this value was negligible, the addition of GNPs decreased this quality by ~13%. Besides, the hardness of the TAG sample is approximately similar to the TG ceramic. Basically, grain size, relative density, microstructure, and composition are the main items that determine the hardness value in composite materials [48]. Though TA owned a higher relative density and a smaller grain size than those of the monolithic TiC, the former secured lower hardness due to the lower hardness of the introduced additive. Moreover, as noted above, the addition of the softer phase of GNPs to the TiC led to a drop in the hardness of TG despite having roughly similar relative density and smaller grain size in comparison with the T sample. Between TG and TAG ceramics, it seems that the various factors, i.e., relative density, composition, and grain size, compensated their mutual impacts, reaching roughly similar Vickers hardness values.\nOn the contrary, compositing uplifts the flexural strength of TiC (Fig. 12). Among the SPSed samples, the lowest strength was obtained for the monolithic TiC, standing next to 500 MPa. Although the addition of GNPs enhanced this value marginally, comprising AlN boosted the flexural strength of TA by around 35%. Moreover, the synergetic impact of both these additives led to an outstanding strength of just higher than 700 MPa. It is well-known that dispersion and fine-grain mechanisms are the chief strengthening routes in the ceramic-based composite materials. Briefly, the difference between the coefficients of thermal expansion of secondary phase(s) and matrix results in forming and locking dislocations over the cooling stage, which impedes cracks propagation (similar to the role of grain boundaries in fine-grain mechanism). In the TA specimen, the addition of AlN led to a drop in the grain size of the TiC matrix, and an increment in the relative density, which was advantageous in improving the flexural strength. Moreover, it seems that the uniform dispersion of such an additive had a great impact on strengthening TiC, too. Though adding only GNPs to TiC had a trivial influence on the flexural strength, possibly the fine-grain and the presence of the secondary phase of GNPs and AlN were responsible for such an increase in the strength of TAG compared to TG. Comparing the TAG and TA specimens, TAG secured a higher strength because of smaller grain size as well as having more dispersed compounds within the matrix.\nThe coefficient of friction (COF) versus sliding distance for each sample is plotted in Fig. 13. The friction behavior of the monolithic TiC and TiC-AlN-Graphene samples is roughly similar. In both these ceramics, the COF value got relatively steady after oscillating between ~0.25–0.3 at first ~60 m. After that, the COF values continuously increased with the sliding distance so that the average COFs were approximately the same for both of them (~ 0.29), based on the\ncalculated values in Fig. 14. In the diagram associated with the TA sample, there was a high instability at first ~75 m of the sliding distance; however, the graph was stabilized after this insecure area. The average COF for this sample was around 0.25, which was lower than those of both T and TAG ceramics. Nevertheless, the highest COF value of 0.39 (Fig. 14) was obtained for the composite doped with 5 wt% GNPs. The sliding behavior of this sample was different from the others.\nThe COF initially increased dramatically from ~0.1 to 0.9, but after ~50 m was stabilized between 0.25 and 0.35.\nAccording to the electron microscopy images taken from the worn surfaces of the samples (Fig. 15), it can be seen that the abrasion\nmechanism was different for each specimen. The abrasion grooves were only visible in the monolithic, and the composite doped with the AlN additive. Both intergranular and intragranular fractures can be seen in the FESEM image of the monolithic TiC, in which the cavities created\nwith the pulled-out grains were filled with the wear debris. Such a mixed fracture mode can also be seen in the TG and TAG samples; however, the intragranular and intergranular fractures were dominant in these composites, respectively. The worn surface of the TA sample, as can be observed in Fig. 15b is completely different from the other ceramics. Not only no pulled-out grain was seen in its worn surface, but the produced wear debris derived from the intragranular fracture was trivial. Possibly the formation of the solid solution of Ti(C,N) and also the lack of GNPs at the grain boundaries were responsible for this outcome."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "In summary, the individual and synergetic impacts of introducing AlN and GNPs were studied on the microstructure and mechanical characteristics of TiC. The AlN additive had a great effect on the sinterability of the TiC-based sample so that the samples containing such an additive reached relative density values higher than 100%. It was found that the marked influence of the AlN additive was reducing the available TiO2 oxide layers on the initial TiC powder. The outcome of this reaction was in-situ TiN, which dissolved within the TiC matrix, forming Ti(C,N) solid solution. The co-addition of AlN and GNPs to TiC resulted in boosting the flexural strength of the produced composite. The fine-grain and dispersion of the secondary phases, along with the better consolidation, were found to be responsible for strengthening the TAG sample. Finally, the highest COF of 0.319 was obtained for the specimen doped with 5 wt% GNPs.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."

The participation of AlN in removing oxygenbearing species (i.e., TiO2) has been found to be explicable for boosting the sinterability of TiC. TiN was formed in-situ as a product of the chemical reaction between AlN and TiO2 compounds, dissolving within the TiC matrix and producing Ti(C,N) solid solution. Moreover, the co-addition of AlN and GNPs resulted in the creation of Al2OC as another in-situ phase. This compound together with the initially introduced additives activated grain refinement and dispersion strengthening mechanisms, uplifting the flexural strength of TiC by ~35% (standing at 703 MPa). Although the intragranular fracture was the predominant wear mode in the monolithic TiC, the synergetic impacts of AlN and GNPs additives altered the prevailing mode to intergranular.",
