Hypoglycemia (low blood glucose level) and hyperglycemia (high blood glucose level) seriously affect the daily life of patients with diabetes (Gavin, 2007; Shabnam et al., 2017; Jedrzak et al., 2018a,b; Salek-Maghsoudi et al., 2018).\nDiabetes, which is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia in clinical medicine, is one of the most important causes of death and amputation, affecting over 100million people worldwide (Rivas et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2017). Some routine clinical laboratory checks for\nglucose levels, which have become an integral part of diabetes care, suffer from several limitations in accuracy, such as strip manufacturing variation, strip storage, and aging. In addition, the accuracy might be affected by environmental factors, such as temperature and altitude, and human factors, such as improper hand washing, altered hematocrit, and naturally occurring interfering substances. Last but not least, exogenous interfering substances may cause errors in the systematic measurement of blood glucose. Consequently, diabetes research centers, clinical laboratories, and medical equipment manufacturers all around the world are working toward the development and design of advanced and domestic glucose-checking devices with improved accuracy (Baghayeri, 2015; Baghayeri et al., 2017, 2020). Plenty of methods have therefore been proposed to monitor blood glucose concentration (Mozaffari et al., 2014; Rahmanian and Mozaffari, 2015; Rahmanian et al., 2015).\nAmong the most successful and reliable diagnostic devices are the glucose electrochemical biosensors that determine the glucose blood level based on glucose oxidase (GOx) using amperometric, impedimetric, conductometric, and potentiometric techniques. Thus, both a steady platform for enzyme immobilization and electroanalytical characterization of the fabricated sensor can guarantee the accuracy of the glucose level investigation (Miwa et al., 1994; Morikawa et al., 2002; Li et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008; Bollella et al., 2017). There are many medical research reports on enzymatic glucose measurements based on the best-nanostructured metal oxide textures and composites (Karimi-Maleh et al., 2019c). Some nanostructured metal oxides such as zinc oxide (ZnO) have been studied in recent years owing to their strong ability to facilitate electron transfer between the electrode and the surface active site (Aini et al., 2015; Baghizadeh et al., 2015; Gallay et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016; Chung et al., 2017; Israr-Qadir et al., 2017; Moghaddam, 2017; Zhou et al., 2017; Karimi-Maleh et al., 2019a,c; Miraki et al., 2019; Shamsadin-Azad et al., 2019; KarimiMaleh and Arotiba, 2020). The application of nanomaterials, especially nanoparticles, in various industries and technologies, and especially in the design of electrochemical sensors, has been well-studied (Rayati and Malekmohammadi, 2016; Dehhaghi et al., 2019; Hassandoost et al., 2019; Hosseini et al., 2019; Karimi-Maleh et al., 2019b, 2020a,b,c; Malekmohammadi et al., 2019). The direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering system is the main strategy for the production of nanostructured ZnO because of its strong capacity created by various materials for fabrication of thin films of metals, alloys, and compounds with thicknesses up to 5 p.m.\nThe advantages of deposition by DC magnetron sputtering system have been documented in many research papers; for example, its high purity; high adhesion film production; proper coverage by high deposition rates; deposition of any metals, alloys, or compounds; suitable porosity; and preparation of considerable volume-to-surface ratios have been intensely discussed in the literature (Panzner et al., 1985).\nIn this study, we develop a powerful glucose biosensor using a covalent immobilization strategy of GOx on a ZnO–polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite film (through cyanuric chloride) that enhances enzyme stability and the biological activity of the\nbiomolecule. The PVA was initially deposited on fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) by a spin-coating technique (PVA/FTO), followed by DC magnetron sputtering to fabricate a nanoZnO/PVA/FTO electrode.\nThe spin coating technique employed for PVA deposition is a procedure used for homogeneous thin film preparation on smooth substrates. Compared with other preparation methods, the spin coating method for the deposition of films has some significant advantages, e.g., low cost of materials and simplicity of technological runs and equipment. In this work, PVA with hydroxyl functional groups exposed on the sensor surface and many other benefits such as water-soluble organic additive activity and an electrostatic repulsive layer for anionic interference was applied to achieve ZnO/PVA nanostructures that can be used as excellent reactive sites for GOx immobilization via covalent linking.\nTo the best of our knowledge, for the first time, glucose determination was carried out by a unique voltammetric method using a GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO biosensor, which demonstrated a powerful ability for real sample analysis with a low detection limit (2.0 µM)."

First, we optimized the spin coating parameters, such as spinning speed, spinning duration, solution volume, and PVA content, for the electrical resistivity. The resistivity of a PVA/FTO surface\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 503\nfabricated by the spin coating technique was measured by using a four-point collinear probe in the air. Four sets of deposition parameters—spinning speed (200–2,400 rpm), spinning duration (10–60 s), solution volume (0.1–0.9mL), and precursor PVA content (1–10 g L−1)—were investigated in order to obtain a uniform and suitable thin film. In each set of samples, only one of the parameters mentioned above was varied while the other parameters were kept constant. Spinning speed has been shown to have substantial effects on many physical properties, such as film thickness and mechanical properties. The spin coating conditions were chosen to be optimal for PVA thin film formation with the best electrical resistivity in this work.\nFigure 1A shows the relation between the PVA thin film electrical resistivity and the spinning speed (200–2,400 rpm). Increasing the spinning speed to 1,750 rpm results in a decrease in the electrical resistivity of the thin film. Decreasing the film thickness by decreasing the spinning speed to 1,750 rpm results in a uniform PVA structure while increasing the spinning speed to 2,500 rpm results in a non-uniform PVA thin film because of the high centrifugal force. The result shows a non-linear relationship between the spinning speed and electrical resistivity of the thin\nfilm. A spinning speed of 1,750 rpm was selected as the optimum spinning speed.\nFigure 1B shows that the electrical resistivity is improved by an increase in spinning duration from 10 to 40 s, while there was no noticeable change after 40 s. During the first few seconds of the spin coating process, a small portion of the substrate is covered by PVA as an electrically conductive layer. After 40 s, the spinning duration did not have any significant effect on the electrode resistance. Therefore, the optimum spinning time was selected as 40 s.\nFigure 1C shows that the resistivity is decreased with an increase in the volume of the deposition solution from 0.1 to 0.7mL, while there was no noticeable change after 0.9mL. Thus, 0.7mL was selected as the optimum volume of the solution for economic reasons.\nThe precursor PVA content is an effective parameter in the spin coating process. The PVA content not only results in a thin film with lower electrical resistivity but also prepares suitable – OH groups in the substrate for GOx covalent immobilization. By increasing the amount of PVA content in the precursor, a lower electrical resistivity of the thin film has been observed\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org 4 July 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 503\n(Figure 1D). Furthermore, the precursor PVA content has a significant effect on GOx immobilization, so a precursor concentration of 10 g L−1 was selected.\nIn summary, 1,750 rpm (spinning speed), 40 s (spinning duration), 0.7mL (the volume of solution), and 10 g L−1 (PVA content) were selected as the optimum conditions for the spin coating procedure."

      "text" : "The nano-ZnO was deposited on the surface of a PVA/FTO electrode using reactive DC magnetron sputtering under an Ar: O2 gas atmosphere while the resistivity was measured by a four-point collinear probe in the air. The Zn cathode plate was bombarded by Ar+ ions generated in the glow discharge plasma placed in front of the Zn target in the evacuated sputtering chamber. A specific amount of O2 gas is used for metal-oxide fabrication in a reactive sputtering process.\nThe deposited ZnO thin film was prepared by chemical reaction of Zn atoms from the target surface and O2 reactive gas during reactive sputtering. The metal–metal oxide composition of the nano-ZnO film can be determined by control of the pressure of Ar and O2 gases (Kelly and Arnell, 2000; Baghriche et al., 2012; Bijad et al., 2013; Yao and Lu, 2013; Mozaffari et al., 2014).\nThe optimum conditions in the synthesis procedure were obtained by varying the sputtering experiment conditions, such as the sputtering power (100–400W); deposition time (1– 25min); distance between the target and substrate (4–10 cm); mixed gas pressure (total gas pressure from 1× 10−3 to 1× 10−2 Torr); and Ar: O2 gas flow ratio (1:1–8:1 sccm/min) in order to obtain a very uniform ZnO thin film.\nAccording to the data reported in Figure 2A, the DC sputtering power showed strong effects on the fabrication of the ZnO thin film. Therefore, optimization of the sputtering conditions to form nano-ZnO thin films with the lowest electrical resistivity is necessary.\nAs can be observed, increasing or reducing the DC sputtering power affects the amount of nano-ZnO sputtered atoms from the target to the substrate. Hence, a lower DC sputtering power leads to a lower amount of Zn sputtered atoms and increases the chance of ZnO formation, which results in higher electrical resistivity of the thin film. However, a higher DC sputtering power of up to 250 watts produced higher amounts of nonreacted Zn sputtered atoms. Additionally, oxygen deficiency in the deposited film increases and leads to lower electrical resistivity. The probable reality behind these comments could be that the PVA thin film is degraded by high-energy particle bombardment due to the excessive DC sputtering power supply, which resulted in a non-uniform thin film.\nThe deposition time was selected as the effective factor for obtaining a uniform nano-ZnO thin film. Lower electrical resistivity of the thin film is observed by increasing the time of deposition from 1 to 10min (Figure 2B). With the increase in deposition time and improvement in the thickness of the thin film, we observed low thin film resistivities that are useful for this type of sensor.\nThe effect of distance between the target and substrate in the range 4–7 cm on the electrical resistivity of the nano-ZnO thin film is shown in Figure 2C. Because of the lower amount of nano-ZnO particles deposited, we detected an improvement in electrical resistivity of the film by increasing the distance between the target and the substrate from 4 to 7 cm. Also, thin film defection by highly energized Ar+ occurred. As shown in Figure 2C, a distance of 7 cm between the target and the substrate was selected as the best condition in this study.\nThe porosity and physical homogeneity of the ZnO thin film is directly affected by the total gas pressure during plasma formation (Figure 2D). This factor can be affected by the deposition rate, which therefore also helps to create a more homogeneous thin film. In this case, a total gas pressure in the range of 1 × 10−3 to 1 × 10−2 Torr was tested and, according to the results obtained, 1 × 10−3 Torr was selected as the optimum condition for total gas pressure.\nThe Ar: O2 gas flow ratio was selected as another factor affecting the preparation of a ZnO thin film with lower electrical resistivity in a reactive DC magnetron sputtering system. By decreasing the oxygen ratio in the gas flow, we detected a lower electrical resistivity of the thin film that is useful for the fabrication of GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO (Figure 2E). This term clarified the important role of the oxygen gas flow ratio in Zn: ZnO phase formation in thin film preparation.\nAccording to the obtained results, 250W (sputtering power), 10min (deposition time), 7 cm (distance between target and substrate), 4 × 10−3 Torr (total pressure), and 8: 1 (Ar: O2 gas flow ratio) were selected as the optimum conditions for the preparation of a uniform ZnO thin film."

One serious problem is the leaching of the biomolecule out of the surface during the preparation process.\nTherefore, a new design based on the reaction between cyanuric chloride as the anchor molecule and PVA as the source of free –OH groups was used. This design helps GOx to be covalently attached to the anchor by its –NH2 groups (Scheme 1). The nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO electrode was dipped into cyanuric chloride ethanolic solution (100 g L−1) for 2 h with stirring. After this step, the amplified sensor was put into 0.1M PBS (pH 7.4) containing 100 units of GOx for 4.0 h with stirring.

We detected an Rct value of 0.9 kΩ for an FTO bare electrode, which confirms that the highest conductivity of this electrode is due to its inherent electrode properties. FTO exhibits a low electrical resistivity owing to the high carrier concentration (Nd) caused by the oxygen vacancies and the fluorine doping.

For reliable impedimetric studies with unchanging conditions, we selected an open circuit potential (OCP) −0.1V system.

The mechanism is explained in detail below.\nAccording to the Henry and Peter microscopic model, sensors researchers described the changing electrical conductance of a semiconducting film sensor in a solution containing toxic gases (Guilbault and Lubrano, 1973; Windischmann and Mark, 1979; Ansari et al., 2008). According to the microscopic model, in the first step, the atmospheric oxygen molecules could be adsorbed at surface sites by physical bonding. According to this reaction, atmospheric oxygen molecules convert to the ion form and are\nthen adsorbed at the surface of the system as O− ads\n. The resulting equation is:\nO2 + 2e − → 2O− (1)\nEquation (1) leads to a decrease in the conductance of the transducer, as indicated by an increase in the potential barrier at the grain boundaries, upon exposing GOx immobilized to glucose, the reaction between GOx and glucose can be described according to the below equations:\nGlucose+O2 → gluconolactone+H2O2 (2) H2O2 → O2 + 2H + + 2e− (3)\nThis results in the production of D-gluconate with an H+ ion, which reacts with O−\nads and thereby releases the trapped electron\nto the conduction band of ZnO, as indicated by the decrease in the potential barrier at the grain boundary.

It must be noted that the survival of the enzyme’s natural structure is necessary to improve the detection limit and sensitivity for glucose detection. PVA possesses a negative charge surface, which repels the negatively charge GOx [with low isoelectric point (IEP) 4.5] at physiological pH (pH = 7.4), so covalent GOx immobilization to the substrate was required.\nUsing supporting electrolytes in an electrochemical process is necessary to eliminate the transport of electroactive species by ion migration in an electric field and to increase the conductivity of the solution.

      "text" : "The catalytic activity of the GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO was determined under the following conditions: a DC current cell and a gold wire (5 cm length, Φ 0.3mm) as an electrode and the GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO as a working electrode were used in a potential range of 0.0–1.0V. At higher voltages, it is possible to oxidize water as a solvent. In water electrolysis, the oxygen will bubble at the anode.\nAs can be seen in Figure 7A, different concentrations of glucose solutions, such as 0.2–20mM, were prepared in 50mL of PBS electrolyte at 25◦C. The effect of increasing the glucose concentration is specified in the I-V curve (Figure 7A).\nThe increase in the slope of the I-V curve (1I/1V) indicates successful enzyme immobilization. The proposed equation for sensitivity determination is: sensitivity = (1I/1V)x – (1I/1V)0/(1I/1V)0, where (1I/1V)0 is the I-V curve’s slope at a glucose concentration of “0.0” mM and (1I/1V)x is the slope of the I-V curve at a glucose concentration of “x” mM, where x = 0.2–20mM of glucose.\nThe volume of 50mL of electrolyte was chosen in all of the electrochemical measurements. Since the amount of glucose with respect to PBS changes with increasing molar concentration, this effect would be reflected in the 1I/1V of the I-V curves, as presented in Figure 7A. Enhancement in the sample current is noticeable, i.e., the film conductivity increases. This enhancement is attributed to the catalytic reaction of GOx and glucose:\nGlucose+O2 → gluconolactone+H2O2\nThe sensitivity (1I/1V) increases promptly with the increase in glucose concentration because of the increase in the hydrolysis of glucose. The resistance of GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO decreases in the presence of glucose. Obviously, H2O2 increases with the increase in glucose, and more and more trapped electrons are returned to the conduction band of the biosensor, which explains the increase in sensitivity of the sensor (partially) linearly (ohmic behavior) with glucose concentration. The high activity of GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO is due to the high surface area of the thin film.\nThe I-V investigation confirms a reversible system and supports the catalytic activity of GOx at the surface of GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO. The linear dynamic range investigation results for the determination of glucose using a GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO biosensor are shown in Figure 7B. I-V responses in Figure 7B shows a working curve in a linear scale [log i (mA) = −7.137 (±0.005) + 0.041 (±0.001) × [glucose] (mM); R2 = 0.998] in a concentration range of 0.2– 20mM of glucose in E = 0.5V. The GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO biosensor exhibits a detection limit of 2.0µM for glucose and a sensitivity of 0.041mA per mM with a linear range of 0.2–20 mM.\nIn addition, the impedimetric signal of nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO vs. the reducing (R) molecule (H2O2, in the absence of glucose) concentration was recorded as new evidence to validate our proposed biosensing mechanism. According to the data (were not shown), there was a significant decrease in the Rct value after the addition of H2O2 from 0.001 to 0.021M. This phenomenon is due to the reaction between the reducing species and the preadsorbed negatively charged oxygen adsorbates (Equation 3). This reaction results in trapped electrons being returned to the conduction band of ZnO, and as a result a decrease in Rct is observed. The obtained results in the impedimetric investigation in the presence of H2O2 species support the proposed mechanism."

Furthermore, the selectivity of GOx/nanoZnO/PVA/FTO toward the determination of glucose (5mM) was investigated by an electrochemical technique by adding the usual concentration of interfering substances that are present in human serum such as uric acid (0.1mM) and ascorbic acid\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org 11 July 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 503\n(0.1mM). The obtained I-V data show a maximum interference of 1.5% in the presence of all of the interfering substances, which confirms the selectivity of GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO as a glucose biosensor.\nNumerous assays have been conducted on blood serum to examine the ability of the GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO biosensor to determine glucose levels in real-life samples using a calibration curve. The results obtained by the proposed method were checked with a spectrophotometric method by a local clinical laboratory (Table 1). The results presented in Table 1 show clearly the ability of the GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO biosensor to act as a novel and powerful tool for determination of glucose in real-life samples.\nThe sensor was studied by recording the CV anodic peak currents in the presence of 5.0mM glucose and 1.0M KNO3 after continuous scanning for 500 cycles, which showed that the electrode retained 96.5% of the initial current response and proved the stability of the biosensor in buffer solution (The data were not shown).\nAdditionally, 10 modified electrodes were utilized for parallel determinations of 5.0mM glucose and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was determined as 1.21%, indicating that the electrode had good reproducibility for the precision study. We detected an RSD value of 1.65% for determination of 5.0mM glucose using the same 10 GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO electrodes fabricated with the same procedure. This RSD value confirmed the good repeatability for GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO as a novel glucose biosensor. The response time of GOx/nanoZnO/PVA/FTO was checked as an important analytical factor and results showed a fast response time (less than 3 s) for GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO in the determination of glucose, confirming the rapid rate of diffusion of the analyte into the enzyme surface and rapid reaction between the analyte and the enzyme. Furthermore, the stability of the GOx/nanoZnO/PVA/FTO biosensor was checked by comparing the\noxidation signal of glucose at different time periods. Three GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO biosensors lost about 0.0, 2.0, and 3.0% of their original activity (for a fixed glucose concentration of 5.0mM), after storage times of 1, 30, and 60 days, respectively. Table 2 compares the analytical characteristics of the GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO biosensor with other reported glucose biosensors. The biosensor in the present work clearly shows better analytical factors, such as the detection limit and response time, than previously reported sensors (Wei et al., 2010; Marie et al., 2015; Gallay et al., 2016; Mandal et al., 2016; Asrami et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2019; Sabu et al., 2019). This advantage is relative to covalent enzyme immobilization in our fabricated biosensor. This covalent enzyme immobilization is the main consideration in creating good Km and Vm factors in an enzymatic biosensor that help to improve biosensor activity."

      "text" : "A novel applied GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO was reported to have high sensitivity and to be a powerful enzymatic biosensor in the measurement of glucose in human blood serum. The nano-material used in the design of GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO created a greater surface area for loading of enzyme that may improve the activity of the fabricated biosensor for determination of glucose. Because of strong enzyme–substrate covalent bonding we concluded that our fabricated biosensor had faster detection kinetics and reduced diffusion resistance in the measurement of glucose. The results obtained at the surface of the GOx/nanoZnO/PVA/FTO showed a fast response time (less than 3 s) and a limit of detection of 2.0µM with a sensitivity of 0.041mA per mM for determination of glucose under optimum conditions. The GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO showed good selectivity with high sensitivity for determination of glucose in real-life samples\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org 12 July 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 503\nsuch as human blood serum.

    "abstractText" : "In the present research, a new biocompatible electrode is proposed as a rapid and direct glucose biosensing technique that improves on the deficiencies of fast clinical devices in laboratory investigations. Nano-ZnO (nanostructured zinc oxide) was sputtered by reactive direct current magnetron sputtering system on a precovered fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) conductive layer. Spin-coated polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) at optimized instrumental deposition conditions was applied to prepare the effective medium for glucose oxidase enzyme (GOx) covalent immobilization through cyanuric chloride (GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO). The electrochemical behavior of glucose on the fabricated GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO biosensor was investigated by I-V techniques. In addition, field emission scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were applied to assess the morphology of the modified electrode surface. The I-V results indicated good sensitivity for glucose detection (0.041mA per mM) within 0.2–20mM and the limit of detection was 2.0μM. We believe that such biodevices have good potential for tracing a number of biocompounds in biological fluids along with excellent accuracy, selectivity, and precise analysis. The fast response time of the fabricated GOx/nano-ZnO/PVA/FTO biosensor (less than 3 s) could allow most types of real-time analysis.",
