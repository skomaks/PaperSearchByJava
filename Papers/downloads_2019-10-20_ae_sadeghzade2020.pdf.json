Artificial scaffolds which used in the field of medicine are usually made of single phase of polymer or ceramic. However, composition of these materials can produce the scaffolds with improve mechanical and biological properties.The aim of this study is to synthesize three-dimensional hardystonite-diopside (HT-Dio) porous scaffolds modified by polycaporolacton fumarate coating for low-load-bearing bone tissue engineering applications. The results showed that hardystonite scaffolds with 15 wt. % diopside and 6 w/v % polymer polycaporolacton fumarate (PCLF) had a significant bioactivity. The cell culture and cell attachment assay results revealed the well spreading of BMS cells on the surface of modified scaffolds which indicates the high biocompatibility of this scaffold. The modified scaffolds had a mean pore size, porosity, compressive strength, modules and toughness of 293.47 � 5.51 μm, 74% � 1.01, 3.37 � 0.6 MPa, 151 � 1.1 MPa and 31.3 � 0.32 kJ/m3, respectively, which are in the appropriate range for spongy bone and hence can be a good candidate for bone tissue engineering applications."

      "text" : "Calcium silicate based ceramics are regarded as a potential bioactive ceramics for bone tissue engineering application. Despite their excellent bioactivity in body environment, a major drawback of these ceramics are their high degradation rate and a high pH value in the surrounding environment of tissue and cells environment which can lead to necrosis. Furthermore, there is a lack of balance between bone formations and calcium silicate degradation which often results in stress shielding phenomenon (Wu et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2013). Incorporation of elements such as Zn, Mg and Zr can selected as one of method to improve the drawbacks of these groups of ceramics (Roohani-Esfahani et al., 2012).\nHardystonite is a calcium zinc silicate mineral with the chemical formula of Ca2ZnSi2O7 (Wu et al., 2005). It belongs to melilite group with a tetragonal structure (Sharma et al., 1988). It has a melting temperature of 1425 �C, density of 3.43 g/cm3, and Mohs hardness of 3–4 (Wu et al., 2005). Recently, hardystonite has received great attention for\nbiomedical applications (Lu et al., 2010; Gheisari and Karamian, 2015; Sadeghzade et al., 2017a; Farzin et al., 2017; Jaiswal et al., 2013). It is composed of Ca, Zn, and Si elements, each plays an important role in the bone remodeling process (Lu et al., 2010; Bellare et al., 2017). Ca was reported to induce osteoblast proliferations and chemotaxis through binding to G-protein coupled extracellular calcium sensing receptors (Xynos et al., 2001; Abed and Moreau, 2007). Zn has been shown to stimulate bone metabolism as well as cell proliferation (Yamaguchi et al., 1988; Yamaguchi, 1998). Also, Zn has also been reported to have capability to encourage the bone growth, bone development, antibacterial properties and effect on osteoclastic bone resorption (Yu et al., 2013).\nSi is also another important element for early ossification process. It plays crucial role in nodule formation and enhance bone mineralization and stimulate both osteogenesis and angiogenesis (Gough et al., 2004a, 2004b). It was found that hardystonite supports cell attachment, cell proliferations and differentiation (Elsayed et al., 2016; Ramaswamy et al., 2008).

It has been used as a bioceramic for treatment of defects and disease in bone and dental root due to its biocompatibility, bioactivity, and higher mechanical properties compared to hydroxyapatite (Ramezani et al., 2017; Wu and Chang, 2007; Wu et al., 2010). It has been used as a secondary phase to produce various composites with better biological and mechanical properties for biomedical applications (Ramezani et al., 2017; García-P�aez et al., 2016; Abdellahi et al., 2018).\nIn our previous study we developed diopside/hardystonite nanostructured scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications (Sadeghzade et al., 2017a). The results showed that hardystonite scaffolds containing 15 wt.% diopside showed better mechanical and biological properties compared to pure hardystonite scaffolds. However, the synthesized scaffolds showed some microcracks on the pore walls which adversely affected the mechanical properties of the scaffolds. One of the methods to improve the mechanical properties and control the degradation rate of scaffolds is applying a polymer coating on the surface of scaffolds (Sadeghzade et al., 2019). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of polycaporolacton fumarate (PCLF) coating on the mechanical and biological behavior of diopside/hardystonite nanostructured scaffolds. The influence of cross linking procedure of polymer on the mechanical properties and biodegradability was studied as well. Applying the polymer coating on the surface of the scaffolds improved the mechanical properties, cell attachment and controlled the degradability of the composite scaffolds."

      "text" : "In order to prepare hardystonite (HT) nanopowder, mechanical alloying method was applied according to our previous studies (Sadeghzade et al., 2016). Briefly, ZnO (Merck, 99% purity), CaCO3 (Merck, 99% purity) and SiO2 (Sigma Aldrich, 99% purity) with molar ratio of 1:2:2, respectively, were mixed in a zirconia planetary ball mill (Retsch, PM 100, Germany). The ball to powder weight ratio was adjusted to 10:1. hardystonite nanopowder was produced after 20 h ball milling with subsequent annealing at 900 �C for 3 h (XINYOO, SX2-2-17TP, China) with heating and cooling rate of 10 C/min.\nPure diopside (Dio) nanopowder was fabricated by a combination of sol-gel technique (Sadeghzade and Emadi, 2019). To prepare diopside, first Ca(NO3)2.4H2O (Merck, 99% purity), MgCl2.6H2O (Merck, 98% purity) and (C2H5O)4Si (samchun, 95% purity) with molar ratio of 1:1:2 were dissolved in absolute ethanol. Then the solution was dried at 80 �C for 24 h and subsequently was annealed at 800 �C for 2 h with heating and cooling rate of 10 C/min.\nThe diopside/hardystonite (Dio/HT) scaffolds were prepared by space holder method as described in our previous study (Sadeghzade et al., 2017a). For this purpose, HT powder was mixed with different percentage of diopside ((Dio/(Dio þ HT): 0, 5, 10 and 15 wt. %). Then the obtained powder was mixed with 80 wt.% NaCl as spacer agent (300–420 μm) to prepare porous scaffolds. The powder mixtures were uniaxial pressed into pellets in a hardened steel mold at a pressure of 65 MPa by a universal testing machine (HOUNSFIELD: H50KS, crosshead rate of 0.5 mm/min). The green bodies were sintered at 1250 �C for 3 h. The results showed that adding 15 wt.% Dio to HT increased the compressive modules and strength from 10.49 � 0.21 and 0.35 � 0.02 MPa to 45.45 � 0.86 and 1.655 � 0.2 MPa, respectively (Sadeghzade et al., 2017a). In order to improve the mechanical properties, the unsaturated PCLF was coated on the surface of the ceramic composites as a modifier. For this purpose, PCLF was dissolved in dichloromethane (Merck, 99%) and a 6 w/v % polymer (PCLF) solution was produced. Cross-linking procedure of PCLF polymer coated on the surface of the scaffold was utilized by chemical and thermal method (Sadeghzade et al., 2018, 2019; Sharifi et al., 2011).\nIn this method, the N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP, Merck, 99%) and\nbenzoyl peroxide (BPO, Merck, 99% purity) at the concentration of 2 (w/w), were selected as accelerator and initiator, respectively and added to polymer solution. Then the ceramics samples were dipped in polymer solutions for 30 min. This procedure was repeated twice for each sample. The coated samples were kept in oven at 70 �C for 30 min and then at 90 �C for 30 min to carry out the crosslinking procedure."

The universal testing machine (UTM TX 001, Model H25KS, Hounsfield Test Equipment, Redhill, England) interfaced with the HTES-series software at ambient temperature. The specimens were then placed between flat surfaces fitted to the universal testing machine with a F1829 load cell with the capacity of 30 KN. The crosshead rate of 1 mm/min was used to determine the compressive strength and modules of the scaffolds. The diameter and height of samples was chosen as 10 mm � 20 mm according to ASTM C-1424-15.\nThe tensile modulus was calculated from the initial 0–5% of linear region of the stress-strain curves while the energy per volume was measured from the area under the stress-strain curves after plastic deformation (toughness). Three samples of each scaffolds were used to measure the mechanical properties.\nThe Archimedes (Sadeghzade et al., 2017b) method was utilized to determine the total porosities of samples.\nTo demonstrate the functional groups of modified and unmodified scaffolds before and after immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, JASCO 680 PLUS) in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode were used in the range of 400–3000 cm 1."

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Philips XL30, acceleration voltage of 30 kV) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to investigate the presence of hydroxyl carbonate apatite (HCA) on the surface of the scaffolds. Biodegradability of scaffolds before and after applying the polymer coating was evaluated by measuring the weight of the samples before and after soaking the scaffolds in buffered saline solution (PBS) (pH value 7.4 at 37 �C temperature) for various times (1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days) (Sadeghzade et al., 2017b). The Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP) (AES; Varian) was utilized to determine the concentration of Ca, P and Si of the optimize scaffold after immersing in the solution."

      "text" : "The BET analysis was used to measure the specific surface area of\nprepared hardystonite and diopside ceramic powders. The measured specific surface area of hardystonite and diopside after sonication in ethanol for 30 min were 170 and 103 m2/g respectively which are in the range of nano-size powders (Saadati et al., 2016).\nThe XRD patterns of the produced powders are shown in Fig. 1a. The XRD pattern of hardystonite powder obtained after 20 h ball milling followed by sintering at 900 �C for 3 h was according to the characteristic peaks of hardystonite phase (JCPDS data file 01-075-0916). Also the characteristic peaks of pure diopside powder (JCPDS data file 01- 071-1067) was observed in the XRD traces of samples obtained after sintering at 800 �C for 2 h for diopside samples. The SEM images of hardystonite and diopside powder were shown in Fig. 1b–c and d-e, respectively. As can be seen, the powders consisted of very fine agglomerated particles with an irregular shape. A narrow distribution of hardystonite and diopside particle size was observed (measured by image J software) in the SEM images in the range of 0.1–0.5 μm and 0.41–1 μm with the highest frequency distribution (35%) (Mode) at 0.287 � 0.02 μm and 0.667 � 0.02 μm, respectively. The mean particle size of hardystonite and diopside powders was 0.394 μm and 0.833 μm, respectively. By comparing the mean particle and crystallite size of hardystonite and diopside powders, it can be found that mechanical alloying plays an important role to produce nanomaterials. According to the literature (Engel and Reid, 2010; Intrater, 2007), the high surface area to volume ratio of nanomaterials, can improve some properties such as diffusion rates, contact area, surface reactivity and biological properties and reduce the required sintering time and temperature to produce bulk ceramic composites or scaffolds.\nIn our previous study the hardystonite-diopside composite scaffolds were successfully prepared (Sadeghzade et al., 2017a). The results showed that adding 15 wt. % Dio nanopowder altered the properties of HT composite scaffolds so that both compressive modules and strength increased to 45.45 � 0.86 and 1.655 � 0.2 MPa, respectively, compared to pure hardystonite scaffolds with 0.35 � 0.02 MPa compressive strength and 10.49 � 0.21 MPa compressive modules. Therefore the hardystonite with 15 wt. % diopside was chosen as the optimum sample from mechanical and physical properties viewpoint. In order to produce a modified scaffold with more similar mechanical and biological properties to that of spongy bone, a thin layer of PCLF polymer was coated on H15D. The effect of the polymer coating on the mechanical properties of\nS. Sadeghzade et al.\nJournal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials 101 (2020) 103445\nscaffolds was evaluated by the compressive strength test. Fig. 2a shows a comparison between the compressive strength and modules of scaffolds obtained in this study and bone as well as previously reported bioceramic and bioglass scaffolds (Roohani-Esfahani et al., 2012; Sadeghzade et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2017c, 2018, 2019; Farzin et al., 2017; Sadeghzade and Emadi, 2019; Sharifi et al., 2011; Joughehdoust et al., 2013; Zreiqat et al., 2002). Also, the average compressive strength, modulus and toughness of the scaffolds before and after modification was shown in Table 2).\nIn this study, PCLF coating was applied with and without crosslinking process. As shown in Fig. 2a, applying the polymer coating without cross-linking increased the compressive strength to about 24% due to the filling of small pores and cracks in the scaffold walls Based on the results, applying the cross-linked polymer coating on H15D led to an increase in the compressive strength and modules from 1.655 � 0.2 and 45.45 � 0.86 MPa to 3.37 � 0.6 and 151 � 1.1 MPa which are close to those of spongy bone with 0.1–16 MPa compressive strength and 120–1100 MPa compressive modules (Fig. 2) (completely different according to statistical analysis in Table 1 and 2S in supplementary materials). Also, the mechanical properties of H15D-6P-cross were measured after 24 h soaking in PBS and 28 days soaking in SBF. After 24 h soaking the modified sample in the PBS, no significant change was observed in the compressive strength (3.29 � 0.5 MPa, Table 2) and modulus (144 � 1.21 MPa, Table 2) in compare to dry one (based on the statistical analysis in Table 1 and 2S in supplementary materials). The compressive strength of the modified scaffolds after 28 day immersion in SBF was measured to investigate the mechanical competence of the scaffolds in contact with bio-fluids. The compressive strength and modulus of the scaffolds were measured to be 3.58 � 0.5 MPa and 148 � 1.21 MPa (Table 2). The results showed an increase in the compressive strength of the specimens after soaking in SBF because of the formation of bone-like apatite inside the pores and at the surface of the scaffolds (statistically different Table 1 and 2S). This result is in a good agreement with the results obtained from the SEM micrographs (Fig. 3) of scaffold before and after soaking in SBF. The typical stressstrain curve of H15D, H-15D-6P and H15D-6P-cross were shown in Fig. 2b. As indicated the H15D scaffold shows the brittle behavior with the failure strain of 5%. Applying the polymer coating led to increase the failure strain about 9% and 13% for H15D-6P before and after crosslinking process. The results of Toughness of different samples were reported in Table 2. Also the statistical analysis of toughness of various samples was shown in Table 3S in supplementary materials (the results shown that all the samples are significantly different). Comparing the stress-strain curve of samples before and after modification shown the H15D-6P-cross sample had the greater area than that for H15D scaffold, which highlights the improvement in toughness of the modified scaffolds.\nThe results obtained in this study revealed that crosslinking of PCLF\ncoating improved the compressive strength and modules compared to previous studies on modified and unmodified ceramics scaffolds (Sadeghzade et al., 2017a, 2019). In fact, formation of cross-linked structure in polymers is exclusively due to the formation of the bond between polymeric chains, which leads to the formation of a three-dimensional network in the polymer. In this case, linear chains of polymer can be interconnected through intermediate shoots and lead to spatial coupling and formation of polymer with a three dimensional network with completely different properties compared to two-dimensional network. These changes affect the polymer properties such as thermal resistance, mechanical properties, solubility and degradability (Desmet et al., 2009; Dhandayuthapani et al., 2011).\nS. Sadeghzade et al.\nJournal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials 101 (2020) 103445\nPolycaprolacton fumarate is one of the newest copolymers derived from polycaprolacton diol, with cross-linking capabilities. In this case, cross linking at high temperature achieved only by the irradiation or adding benzoyl peroxide and NVP, (by breaking the C–C bonds) without inserting unsaturated compositions into the PCLF chain.\nIn a previous study, HA scaffolds with PCLF coating (different molecular weight) was synthesized via the polyurethane foam reticulate method (Sharifi et al., 2011). The mechanical properties and porosity of the modified HA scaffolds with 30 w/v % PCLF in different molecular weight (530, 1250 and 2000) were measured to be 16.22, 18 and 30 MPa, and 52, 47 and 42%, respectively. The obtained porosity in that study was far away from the ideal scaffolds (>80%) (Yunos et al., 2008).\nThe main drawback of porous ceramic scaffolds is their inherent brittleness which reduces their applications in bone tissue engineering (Wu et al., 2010; Kuttappan et al., 2016).\nThe SEM images of scaffolds after modifying process with PCLF are demonstrated in Fig. 3a–d. As can be seen in Fig. 3a and b, the H15D-6P scaffold have an interconnected network of porosities.\nThe pore size distribution in the scaffolds was shown in Fig. 3g (measured by image J software). The pore size was in the range of 50–500 μm with the highest frequency distribution (33%) (Mode) of 156.55 � 0.31 μm. The mean pores size of modified scaffolds by PCLF polymer was 293.47 μm. Applying a thin layer of PCLF reduced the pore size; however, the pore size is still in the standard range for an ideal bone scaffold (10–500 μm) (Arifvianto and Zhou, 2014). In fact, one of the important factors in designing and fabrication of an ideal bone scaffold is the pore architecture and porosity content. These factors have an inverse relationship with mechanical properties. Increasing the pore size and porosity reduce the mechanical properties. Therefore, it is important to make a balance between the mechanical properties, pore size and porosity. A suitable pore size provide an appropriate environment for vascularization, cell migration, adhesion, proliferation and differentiation (Farzin et al., 2017; Ramezani et al., 2017; Rezwan et al., 2006). Also, pore size affects the supply of oxygen and nutrients and removal of the waste (Sadeghzade et al., 2018). SEM images of H15D-6P-cross sample showed a smooth surface without any crack (Fig. 3c and d).\nThe porosity of scaffold was measured by Archimedes method. The mean porosity of H15D-6P-cross was 74% � 1 which showed a negligible decrease compared to H15D (~77% � 1).\nIn order to study the bioactivity behavior of H15D-6P-cross scaffold, the samples were soaked in SBF for 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. Changes in pH value and ion concentration of SBF solution at various soaking times were measured as well. Fig. 3e and f shows the SEM images of modified scaffolds after 28 days soaking in SBF. As seen in Fig. 3 e-f, white particles covered the surface of the scaffolds. EDS spectra of the surface of scaffold before immersion in SBF shows the presence of Mg, Zn, Si, Ca element peaks which confirmed the presence of hardystonite and diopside and proved the absence of NaCl. Also, the presence of phosphate peak in the EDS spectra of modified scaffolds after 28 days soaking in SBF proved that the white particles are bone like apatite. The weight percentage of each elements on the surface of the scaffolds before and after soaking in SBF for 28 days were shown in Table 3. As seen, the Ca/P ratio was measured to be 1.94. This ratio is higher than the Ca/P ratio of hydroxyapatite with 1.67 content which is due to the presence of Ca ion in hardystonite and diopside ceramic structure.\nBy comparing the SEM images of modified (Fig. 3e and f) and unmodified scaffolds in our previous study (Sadeghzade et al., 2017a), it was found that applying the PCLF coating on the surface of the scaffolds, not only did not reduce the scaffold bioactivity, but also led to the formation of larger apatite particles. The size of apatite particles was in the range of 5–10 μm and 1–2 μm in modified and unmodified scaffold, respectively.\nAfter soaking the scaffolds in SBF, some reactions occur on the\nS. Sadeghzade et al.\nJournal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials 101 (2020) 103445\ninterface of scaffold and surrounding environment, which result in the formation of an apatite layer. The nucleation of this layer improves the adhesion of the implant to the tissue and encourages the growth and regeneration of bone.\nFig. 4a shows the pH changes of modified and unmodified scaffolds as a function of soaking time. The statistical analysis of pH changes was shown in Table 4S in supplementary materials. Only the data that are statistically different were discussed. The solubility of the samples is the main reason for pH changes. In comparison, the unmodified scaffolds showed a higher release of ions during 2 days immersion (7.4–8.42), while the pH changes of modified scaffolds had a small gradual increase and not as much as the unmodified one (7.4–7.9) at the same time. In fact, pH changes in solution was due to the ionic exchange between the surface of the scaffolds and SBF solution. The increase and decrease of pH, represents the nucleation of apatite on the surface of the scaffolds (Kim, 2003). The first step in this process is to break down the silicate bonds and to release ions such as Ca2þ, Zn2þ, Mg2þ from silicate chain and exchange them with Hþ in SBF (Sadeghzade et al., 2017b; Kim, 2003). Following this process, the silanol groups (Si–OH) with a negative charge cover the surface of the ceramic material which leads to the adsorption of Ca2þ and PO43 from the SBF solution. Therefore, the apatite nuclei can be formed on the sample surface, and they enable spontaneously grew by consuming Ca2þ and HPO4 3 ions from the surrounding fluid (Mehrali et al., 2016; Shirazi et al., 2014).\nAs can be seen, applying the polymer coating reduced the release of ions from the scaffold and controlled the pH of the surrounding environment which can prevent the tissue necrosis or inflammation (Sadeghzade et al., 2017b; Kim, 2003). According to the pH results, the apatite nucleation began after 2 and 7 days soaking in SBF for the scaffolds before and after applying the coating, respectively. This delay in the apatite nucleation is solely due to the applying of the polymer coating and subsequently the reduction of ion release rate and the scaffold degradability.\nChanges in the calcium, phosphor and silicium concentration as a function of soaking time for the samples before and after modification was demonstrated in Fig. 4b–d. The statistical analysis was shown in Tables 5–7S in the supplementary materials. All the comparisons were performed between the samples which were significantly different. As\nseen, Ca2þ and Si4þ concentrations in SBF solution increased for both modified and unmodified scaffolds after 1 day soaking which is in a good agreement with the pH changes. This phenomenon is due to the breakage of silicate bonds and release of Ca2þ and Si4þinto the solution. Realizing of the Si4þ ion in solution was continued until the 28 day soaking for both modified and unmodified samples (Fig. 4c). As can be seen in Fig. 4b, by increasing the immersion time in SBF, Ca2þ ion concentration suddenly decreased which can be ascribed to the precipitation of Ca–P layer on the surface of the scaffolds; however, after applying the polymer coating Ca2þ ion concentration increased up to 7 days, and then decreased due to the precipitation of apatite layer (Sadeghzade et al., 2017a; Sharifi et al., 2011). The calcium ion content increased again after 21 days soaking in SBF as a result of the breakage the polymer coating and degradation of scaffolds. The most changes in P concentration occurred after soaking the scaffolds in SBF for 1 days (Fig. 4d).\nBy increasing the soaking time, a gradual decrease was observed in P as a result of the formation of apatite on the surface of the both modified and unmodified scaffolds.\nThe FTIR results of scaffolds with PCLF coating before and after various soaking times in SBF were shown in Fig. 5a. The presence of polymer coating delayed the breakage of silicate bonds and the degradation of the scaffolds. The FTIR patterns related to modified scaffolds before soaking in SBF showed the peaks of ester carbonyl functional group (C–O), the asymmetric stretching motion of C–O–C, and C–C (¼O)–O at 1725 cm 1, 1161 cm 1and 1104 cm 1, respectively (Sharifi et al., 2011; Joughehdoust et al., 2013). Also, adsorption peak of methylene (C–H) bond was observed at 2945 cm 1. The main peak of functional fumarate group (C–C) with very low intensity, was observed at around 1645 cm 1 (Sharifi et al., 2011; Joughehdoust et al., 2013). The low intensity of the main peak was due to the cross-linking process (Sharifi et al., 2011; Joughehdoust et al., 2013). The presence of this peak confirmed the formation of PCLF polymer (Sharifi et al., 2011; Joughehdoust et al., 2013). Also the characteristic peaks of Si–O–Si were detected in the range of 900–1000 cm 1 and 600-700 cm 1.\nAfter soaking the scaffolds in SBF solution for 14 days, the nucleation of apatite was observed. The characteristic peaks of the phosphate groups in the structure of apatite appeared in 916 and 718 cm 1\nS. Sadeghzade et al.\nJournal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials 101 (2020) 103445\n(Sadeghzade et al., 2017b). The characteristic peaks related to P–O bonds was observed after 28 days immersion in SBF at 1068, 1014, 970, 934, 902, 716, 473, 454 and 441 cm 1 (Kim, 2003). Also, a small peak of carbonate was found at 1419 cm 1 (Chen et al., 2014). The peak at 1014 cm 1 can be correspond both CO stretching vibration; overlapped with PO stretching vibration (Puvaneswary et al., 2015). The FTIR results confirmed the presence of apatite on the surface of samples (white particles in Fig. 3e and f). the XRD patterns of H15D-6P-cross before and after soaking in SBF after 28 days were shown in Fig. 5b the characteristic peaks of PCLF was observed in the range of 20–22 �. Furthermore, the characteristic peaks of diopside and hardystonite were detected before soaking the modified samples in SBF. Following 28 days immersion the scaffolds in SBF, the characteristic peaks of apatite (JCPDS data file 01-076-0694) at 28.1, 29, 31.7, 32.1, 32.8, 34 and 39 � were detected.\nThe degradation rate of scaffolds must be controlled and matched with the regeneration rate of surrounding tissue to gradually transfer load to new tissue. Hence, a scaffold acts as a temporary platform which must keep its structure and function until the new tissue forms. Applying the polymer coating can play an effective role to control the degradation rate and the pH of surrounding environment and to maintain the scaffold structure until the new tissue forms.\nThe degradability of modified and unmodified scaffolds was evaluated by immersing the samples in PBS for 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. All\ncomparisons were performed between the data which were significantly different (according to the results of statistical analysis, Table 8S in supplementary materials). After removing the samples from PBS, they were dried in an oven and weighed out. Fig. 6a shows the weight loss of samples as a function of soaking time in PBS. Applying the polymer coating reduced the degradability of scaffolds compared to the unmodified scaffolds. 31% weight loss was observed after soaking the modified scaffolds for 7 days in PBS while the unmodified scaffolds showed around 65% weight loss. TGA curve of scaffolds before and after modification were shown in Fig. 6b. No reduction not be observed at the TGA analysis of H15D, while the low decomposition related to PCLF coating was observed in around 363–421 �C (weight loss: 5%). Based on the TGA results the PCLF coating can be stabilized under the 363 �C. in the other study on PCL coating on the porous composite scaffold of chitosan/β-tricalcium phosphate by Fang et al. was reported that the PCL thermal temperature stability is around 388 �C and the sharp reduction happened in this temperature. These results shows that inserting the fumarate groups in the structure of PCL polymer and transferring to PCLF and creating the self-crosslink ability can improved the thermal decomposition stability of polymers (Fang et al., 2012).\nAssessment of biocompatibility, cell proliferation and cell viability of modified scaffolds (H15D-6P-cross) were performed using MTT test. The results of statistical analysis were presented in Table 9S. Proliferation and cell viability percentage of bone marrow stem cells cultured on\nS. Sadeghzade et al.\nJournal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials 101 (2020) 103445\nmodified scaffolds after 1, 7 and 14 days were presented in Fig. 7. An increase in culture time up to 14 days increased the cell viability of the surface and pores of the modified scaffolds. In all the samples, the percentage of cell viability was above 85%, which indicated that the modified scaffolds were not toxic (Montazeri et al., 2010).\nVarious factors such as the type and amount of ions, pH changes in the culture medium and the time of culture affect the cell proliferation and cell viability. Exclusively, the presence of magnesium ions in the modified scaffolds and the release of Mg in the medium, is the main reason for increasing the cell proliferation (Yazdimamaghani et al., 2015).\nThe proliferation rate of modified scaffolds was 91.61 � 1.1, 93.91 � 0.87, 105 � 2 and 130 � 1.07% after 1, 3, 7 and 14 days, respectively. As seen, by increasing the culture time to 7 and 14 days, the proliferation rate was significantly higher than the control sample. Beside the release of Mg2þ ions, some other ions such as Zn2þ, Ca2þ and Si4þ released and affected the cell proliferation, differentiation and adhesion. Each of these ions has a certain function in the body. Based on the previous studies (Diba et al., 2014) Si is the main element in the skeletal development, and caused the proliferation of osteoblast cells. Calcium ion also exist in the bone and body liquid cellular matrix, which increases the metabolism and the association of osteoblast and osteoclast cells which increases bone formation (Roohani-Esfahani et al., 2012; Sadeghzade et al., 2017a). Zinc ion leads to the elimination of harmful bacteria around the cells and improve cell proliferation (Yamaguchi, 1998). Zinc also enable to reduce osteoclastic differentiation (Bhardwaj et al., 2013).\nThe SEM images of the BMS cells on the surface of H15D-6P-cross at different magnifications were demonstrated in Fig. 7b and c. Cell spreading, and adhesion were observed after 7 days soaking in medium. Cells were exist on the outer surface of scaffolds as well as inside the pores. The main reason of cell spreading was the presence of silanol groups on the surface of silicate based ceramics scaffolds. Jung et al. (No et al., 2019) developed a new injectable bone cement composite composed of Sr and hardystonite (Sr-HT). The human osteoblasts (HOB) cyto-compatibility and new bone formation around the Sr-HT cement was observed compared to commercially available clinical cement. This phenomenon was due to higher degradability and the release of the Zn2þ, Sr2þ, Ca2þ and Si4þ ions into the biological environment which resulted in the formation of Si–OH groups on the surface of cements and subsequently provided an active environment for the adsorption of cells and proteins.\nIn another study (Sharifi et al., 2011), the PCLF coating was applied on the hydroxyapatite scaffolds. The MTT results showed that applying the PCLF coating with different molecular weight on hydroxyapatite scaffolds did not have a toxic effect and had a negligible influence on cell viability. The cell viability of the optimum scaffold with PCLF coating was around 100%. However, in this study the H15D-6P-cross showed 130% cell viability. The main reason for this phenomenon is the presence of the Si4þ and Ca2þ ions in extracellular environment which are the key factors in increasing the proliferation rate and differentiation of osteoblast cells. Also, another factor that influences the cell viability is the thickness of polymer coating. Sharifi et al. (2011) applied a PCLF polymer coating on HA scaffolds with two different percentage of PCLF (12.5 and 30 w/v %). The results of MTT assay showed that all the samples with thinner polymer coating had higher proliferation rates (higher cell viability %) compared to the scaffolds infiltrated with a thicker solution. This can be attributed to the availability of more location of ion exchange with the culture environment. In this study, since the scaffolds were coated with 6 w/v % PCLF, more regions are available for ion exchange with the medium which consequently increased the cell viability and cell proliferation."

      "text" : "H15D scaffold with 6 w/v% PCLF polymer coating was successfully\nfabricated by sol-gel method. The results showed that applying the polymer coating on the surface of hardystonite-diopside scaffolds improved the mechanical properties from 1.655 MPa in H15D to 3.37 MPa in modified scaffolds with 6 w/v% PCLF coating. The porosity and mean pore size for the modified scaffolds was 74 � 1% and 293.47 μm, respectively. Apatite formation ability of modified scaffold was characterized with SEM, EDS and FTIR. The results had a good agreement with pH changes and Ca ion concentration and proved the presence of apatite colonies on the surface of scaffolds. The degradability of modified scaffolds was determined by the changes in pH and Ca ion concentration. A higher cell viability of modified scaffolds was observed after 14 days soaking in culture medium compared to 1 days soaking which shows the biocompatibility of scaffolds. Furthermore, spreading and attachment of BMSC cells on the surface of scaffolds showed the potential of this composite for bone tissue engineering applications."

Artificial scaffolds which used in the field of medicine are usually made of single phase of polymer or ceramic. However, composition of these materials can produce the scaffolds with improve mechanical and biological properties.The aim of this study is to synthesize three-dimensional hardystonite-diopside (HT-Dio) porous scaffolds modified by polycaporolacton fumarate coating for low-load-bearing bone tissue engineering applications. The results showed that hardystonite scaffolds with 15 wt. % diopside and 6 w/v % polymer polycaporolacton fumarate (PCLF) had a significant bioactivity. The cell culture and cell attachment assay results revealed the well spreading of BMS cells on the surface of modified scaffolds which indicates the high biocompatibility of this scaffold. The modified scaffolds had a mean pore size, porosity, compressive strength, modules and toughness of 293.47 � 5.51 μm, 74% � 1.01, 3.37 � 0.6 MPa, 151 � 1.1 MPa and 31.3 � 0.32 kJ/m3, respectively, which are in the appropriate range for spongy bone and hence can be a good candidate for bone tissue engineering applications.",
