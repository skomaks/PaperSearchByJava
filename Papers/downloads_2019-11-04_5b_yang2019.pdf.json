      "text" : "The issue of heat transfer in the industry has a practical importance and status. The ability to conduct the heat of fluids plays an important role in the amount of heat loss and, in general, energy loss. Water, ethylene glycol and oil are the fluids commonly used in various industries [1,2]. Given the recent advances and new technologies in some industries, in order to use this category of fluids, it is necessary to improve the performance of their thermal properties. In this regard, researchers are now trying to improve their thermal properties using Nano-fluids and a stable suspension of Nano-particles in base fluids [3–5].\nNano-fluid was first introduced by Choi and Eastman [6] in 1995 and it was referred to suspension of Nano-particles which were 1–100 nm in base fluids. Since thermal conductivity of solids is higher than liquids, suspension of solid particles is an effective way to improve thermal conductivity [7]. Different nano-particles such as metal groups, metal oxides and carbon groups can be used to produce Nano-fluids [8].\nThe nano-particles with carbon structure [9,10] have attracted the attention of researchers due to their thermo-physical properties; and so far, numerous studies have been performed on the use of graphite nanoparticles [11], graphene nano sheets [12], carbon nanotubes [13], graphene oxide Nano-sheets [14], Fullerene [15] and carbon fibers in thermal applications and energy storage.\nAccording to scientists, the unique properties of the graphene Nanosheet, including its thermal properties, have not yet been thoroughly investigated [16,17]. With the production of graphene oxide and the reduction of functional groups at its surface, the properties of these nano-particles get closer to graphene nano-particles. Graphene oxide is a carbon nano-particle with a two-dimensional structure and has a high specific surface area; it has attracted much attention in recent decades due to its unique physical, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties [18,19]. It is widely used in electronic, catalytic, sensors, energy conversion and energy storage [20–22]. Due to the thermo-physical properties and features of graphene oxide nanosheets, mass production is of high importance.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2019.104353\n⁎ Corresponding author at: Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Solar Energy Science and Technology, School of Energy and Environment, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, PR China.\nE-mail address: windy4ever@163.com (L. Yang).\nInternational Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer 109 (2019) 104353\n0735-1933/ © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\nT\nOne of the most important thermo-physical properties of Nanofluids is their thermal conductivity, which has a direct effect on the thermal performance of heat transfer systems and has been studied in a wide range of studies [23,24]. Considering the high potential of nanoparticles to produce Nano-fluids, extensive research has been carried out on the preparation and stability of Nano-fluids containing graphene and their thermal performance. For example, Ranjbarzadeh et al. [25] investigated the thermal performance of graphene oxide/ water Nanofluids in a cross flow heat transfer system in an experimental study. Their results indicated that the use of the mentioned Nano-fluid improves the process of heat transfer to the air flow passing around the tubes under cross flow. In another practical research, they used the water / graphene oxide Nano-fluid to improve the thermal absorption process in a constant temperature system. In their results with regard to the improved thermal performance of the Nano-fluid, they reported that this Nano-fluid was an appropriate alternative to be used in stable (constant) heat transfer systems [26]. Ijam et al. [27] experimentally investigated the preparation, stability and measurement of the thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity of the water-ethylene glycol/ graphene oxide on Nano-fluid. They conducted the experiments based on the mass fraction of 0.01 to 0.1% at a temperature range of 25–45 °C and finally reported that thermal conductivity, at best, improved by 10.47%, and the dynamic viscosity of nano-particles decreased by up to 35% in a linear manner. Weyl et al. [28] empirically examined the graphene/water Nano-fluid combined with triethanolamine in different concentrations. The Nano-fluid stability was studied with a Spectrophotometer device. This Nano-fluid exhibited a completely Newtonian behavior with increasing concentrations, which enhanced viscosity. Thermal conductivity enhanced by increasing the concentration, special surface area of nano-particles, and temperature. The results of this study showed that the Nano-fluid has the highest thermal conductivity in 750 m2/g samples with mass fraction of 0.1%. Zhang et al. [29] empirically investigated the thermo-physical properties of reduced\ngraphene oxide nano-particles. In this study, the nano-particles were synthesized by the modified Hummers method and after investigating the structure of nano-particles, the Nano-fluids were prepared using a two-step method. They reported the highest Nano-fluid stability as 0.2mgr/mlit at pH=12, and the thermal conductivity increased to 32.19 at 60 °C. At the end of this section, summery key points of several studies on the thermal conductivity of nanofluids containing graphene are collected in Table 1.\nAccording to the previous studies and due to the complex structure of Nano-fluids, the theatrical experimental correlation cannot account for the changes occurred in the thermo-physical behavior of Nano-fluid [40–42]; in fact, it is difficult to understand the physical rules governing the actual behavior of Nano-fluids. For the same reason, the laboratory's measurement of thermo-physical properties of Nano-fluids is of particular importance, and in this case, by providing experimental correlation, the properties under the limits and conditions defined for the experimental correlation can be calculated. Therefore, because of the unique properties of the graphene Nanosheet, its effect on the water thermal conductivity is experimentally investigated. In this way, the Nano-fluid stability measurements are evaluated using DLS and TEM tests in addition to the sedimentation photograph capturing method. After that, the thermal conductivity of Nano-fluid under the impact of mass fraction and Nano-fluid temperatures is measured. Then, based on the laboratory data and through the curve fitting method, an experimental correlational along with calculation of its margin of deviation is presented."

      "text" : "The production method of Nano-fluid has a noteworthy influence on the quality of nano-particles dispersed in the base fluid, and conversely, the accumulation of nano-particles is an important issue in the fabrication of Nano-fluids [45,46]. The preparation of a stable Nano-fluid is a major challenge for the use of Nano-fluids. The formation of agglomerates because of the presence of intermolecular forces in nanoparticles causes changes in the thermo-physical properties of Nano-fluid [47,48], which is very important for practical applications of Nanofluids.\nGraphene oxide/Water Nano-fluid was produced in a two-step process using three chemical, magnetic and ultrasonic processes. Eq. (1) was used to determine the mass of nano-particles for the fraction of different masses. To weigh the nano-particles, we used a digital scale with a precision of 0.001 g. According to studies, the highest stability of Nano-fluids containing graphene oxide nano-particles lies in the alkaline-based fluid range [49,50]. For this purpose, four base fluid samples were prepared with alkaline pH, and after making the Nano-fluid according to the results of sedimentation photograph capturing, the optimum pH was determined. To make the final sample, a magnetic stirrer was used for one hour to mix the nano-particles in the base fluid, and after combining the nano-particles with the base fluid, suspension was exposed to ultrasonic waves for 60min in order to be homogenized.\n= + ∗wt m m m (%) 100GO GO H O2 (1)\nGraphene oxide nano-particles have properties such as: high thermal conductivity, high specific surface area, hydrophobicity, insolubility and low density.\nIn order to create long-term stability for Graphene oxide/Water Nano-fluid, physical and chemical methods are used. Here, the stability of Nano-fluid in the first stage was investigated to determine the optimal pH using sedimentation photograph capturing. The effect of the base fluid's pH was examined in 7–8–9–10 amounts. Initially, due to the optimal pH determination, ultrasonic was used at a very limited time (about one minute) to disperse particles in the base fluid. After determining the best stability conditions based on the pH of the base fluid, the Nano-fluid was produced by taking other parameters such as ultrasonic time into account. Then, DLS and TEM tests were used for more precise and accurate evaluation of Nano-fluid stability."

      "text" : "In the current paper, the thermal conductivity of different Nanofluids was measured by the transient hot-wire method (THWM) and according to ASTM D2717 - 95 standard. The Nano-fluid thermal conductivity was measured by employing the KD2-Pro thermal property analyzer at temperatures of 20–30–40–50–60 °C. The KS-1 sensor was used to measure the temperature and the WNB 7 Memmert temperature bath was used to stabilize the temperature of the sample. The schematic of measuring system is shown in Fig. 1.\nIn order to ensure the correct operation of the test equipment and the obtained results, first the pure water thermal conductivity was\nmeasured and compared with the data of the main references. The ASHRAE Handbook [51] was used to evaluate and compare the results, and the results are presented in Fig. 3. It is seen that the measured values of the thermal conductivity differ slightly from the main reference, with maximum error of 1%, indicating that the obtained results are acceptable in Fig. 2."

Fig. 3 shows the result of the XRD test for graphene oxide sample and the changes in the distance between the layers and the crystallinity properties. The peak diffraction, seen in the figure, belongs to graphene oxide. This peak, due to the presence of oxygen-containing groups such as hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyls, creates a gap between the layers.\nThe results of FESEM for the graphene oxide nano-particles, used to examine the morphology and structure of nano-particles, are presented in Fig. 4 FESEM images of nano-particles show that the surface structure of the particle are layered and sheeted. The edge of the graphene oxide sheets is located on its own and this creates wrinkled surfaces. The results of the present research are consistent with the findings of the layered structure of graphene oxide in previous studies [52,53]."

      "text" : "In the preset study, the effect of pH parameter was investigated to increase the duration of stability. In the initial stage of Nano-fluid stability investigation under the influence of pH change, the sedimentation photograph capturing technique was employed. After determining the optimal pH (pH=8), the time of using the ultrasonic device was also experimentally determined. During a 60-min period, the stability of the samples was very good, and with the increase in the time of using ultrasonic, no change was seen in the stability of the sample. DLS-TEM tests were applied for more accurate testing of the stability.As we know, one of the big challenges in using nanofluids is their poor long-term stability. We cannot claim that nanofluids are stable at long-time, but performing some tests at different times can yield results about their stability [54–57]. In this study, DLS tests have been performed after 1 day and 1month. In the DLS test, the data about their size range have been gained according to Mie's theory [58], and the findings are shown in Fig. 5. The findings can explain the long-term dispersion stability of graphene oxide in water. As shown in Fig. 5, the particles have Nanoscale dimensions and the highest intensity is related\nto the particle size of 44 nm for a sample after 1 day and 58 nm for a sample after 1month. This result showed that the stability of this nanofluid declined over time. Conversely, it is noteworthy that the small and Nanoscale dimensions of particles relative to micro size will result in long-term stability and improve the stability of the Nano-fluid properties.\nOne of the ways to study the stability of Nano-fluids and determining the structure of nano-particles in the base fluid is the use of scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results. In this study, TEM test is used to determine the Nano-fluid stability. The analysis was carried out using the PHILIPS EM device, 100Kv manufactured by the Netherlands. The obtained result is presented in Fig. 6.\nUsing the results of the TEM analysis presented in Fig. 6, the surface structure of nano-particles, their size and distribution in the water-base fluid are observed. The results show that the nano-additives have a sheet shape and the quality of Nano-fluid is observed by considering the particle size, shape of sheets and dispersion of the nano-additives in the\nbase fluid. In the current research performed on thermal conductivity, the observation of the nano-particle's sheets shape in the base fluid is crucial because the thermal properties of this group of nano-particles are associated with their sheet structure, and the thermal conductivity is along the sheet is very high for graphene oxide nano-particles."

      "text" : "The experimental results obtained for the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of Graphene oxide/Water Nano-fluid are presented in Fig. 7. According to the results, it can be observed that by augmenting temperature, as an effective parameter, the thermal conductivity of the Nano-fluid is enhanced. At higher temperatures, the change slope is much greater, which means that the thermal conductivity is more influenced by higher temperatures. The contribution of increasing the thermal conductivity under the influence of temperature is very great. In fact, increasing the thermal conductivity under the influence of temperature increase could be due to the\nBrownian motion of the nano-particles in the base fluid, that by rising the temperature, the amount of Nano-fluid kinetic energy will increase. The increase in temperature enhances the physical interactions between nano-particles and water molecules; thus, this will lead to improving the process of heat transfer due to thermal conductivity.\nIn order to observe the changes in the thermal conductivity of the Nano-fluid in relation to the base fluid, the Eq. (2) is used, where, the thermal conductivity of the Nano-fluid and base fluid are kf and knf, respectively.\n= − ∗ k k\nk Thermal Conductivity enhancement (%) 100nf f\nf (2)\nAt the lowest mass fraction of the test, the improvement of thermal conductivity for the Graphene Oxide/ Water Nano-fluid in the test temperature range is 1.83–4%, and also in the mass fraction of 1.5%, the improvement of thermal conductivity with respect to temperature\nchanges is 23.1–48.15%. According to the obtained results in Fig. 8, it can be argued that the influence of temperature on the improvement of thermal conductivity is effective. With regard to the thermal performance of the Nano-fluid under the influence of temperature, it can be said that when the Nano-fluid is practically used, if the thermal load of the system increases, the Nano-fluid function will automatically improve at higher temperatures and these changes are one of the positive and effective features of Nano-fluid, while the performance of the base fluid with increasing temperature is very slight."

      "text" : "By enhancing the Nano-fluid concentration, the amount of graphene oxide nano-particles with a higher thermal conductivity than the water increases in the Nano-fluid, and thereby leading to an increased thermal conductivity of the Nano-fluid. It can be seen in Fig. 9 that for higher mass fractions the thermal conductivity increases with a greater slope.\nThe positive changes in the thermal conductivity of Nano-fluid due to increased concentrations are related to physical interactions in the Nano-fluid environment. By increasing the concentration of nano-particles, the maximum increase in the thermal conductivity was up to 48.15%, and it can be stated that as the number of particles in the base fluid increases, the phenomenon of mixing will enhances due to the Brownian motion, and a significant increase in the thermal conductivity of the Nano-fluid compared to the base fluid is resulted. These results are consistent with the results of Das et al. [59]. According to the obtained results, it can be argued that the use of Nano-fluid at higher temperatures as well as appropriate concentrations can provide the best efficiency.\nIn Fig. 10, the effect of mass fraction on the improvement of the thermal conductivity of the Nano-fluid is presented. This figure has been presented to better understand the behavior of improved thermal conductivity of the Nano-fluid under the influence of increased mass concentration. According to the results, it is observed that at the lowest test temperature, the improvement of the thermal conductivity of Graphene oxide/Water Nano-fluid in the study mass fraction range is 1.83–23.1 and also at 60 °C, the improvement of thermal conductivity with respect to the increased mass fraction is 48.15%; it can be stated that the improved thermal conductivity is due to an increase in mass fraction, and the results revealed that the improvement of the thermal conductivity under the influence of mass fraction is higher than that of the temperature.\nBy increasing the mass fraction of the Nano-fluid, the improvement of thermal conductivity is always enhanced, but the excessive increase in Nano-fluid concentration causes problems such as instability of the nano-particles in the base fluid and a significant increase in Nano-fluid viscosity [43]."

In this study for characterization of the nano-particles, the atomic and surface properties of nano-particles were evaluated. Then, preparation, stability, and thermal conductivity measurement of the Nano-fluid in a wide temperature range as well as the mass fraction of the particles were investigated. The findings of this research are presented as follows:\n1. Among the main reasons for the established stability are the presence of functional groups on the surface of graphene oxide nanoparticles, the absence of a difference in the density of the base fluid, the Nanoscale size of the sheets in the base fluid and the determination of optimal pH, which has been investigated experimentally in this study. 2. By examining the effect of the base fluid pH, it can be stated that the best pH value of the base fluid is 8. The final Nano-fluid sample used to measure thermal conductivity had 6months of complete stability. 3. The results of our study on the Nano-fluid stability indicate that the particles dispersed in the base fluid have Nanoscale dimensions, and this particle size can be a reason for long-term stability of the Nanofluid. 4. Increasing the temperature and mass concentration of the Nanofluid increases the thermal conductivity of the Nano-fluid. The highest increase of the thermal conductivity in our research scope is up to 48.15%. 5. A new correlation was presented according to the experimental results in terms of the temperature and concentration variables the curve fitting method was used to derive the equation. According to the margin of deviation value which was 2.1%, it can be argued that this equation has an acceptable accuracy.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."

FESEM and XRD tests were used for characterization of nano-particles. After getting assured of the structure of nano-particles, a two-step method was applied to produce Graphene oxide/Water Nano-fluid. Optimal pH, DLS and TEM tests were used to determine the stability. The mass fraction range of the Nano-fluid in this study was 0–1.5%, and the thermal conductivity was measured in the temperature range of 20–60 °C according to ASTM D2717–95 standard. The results indicate that the Nano-fluid has the highest stability at optimum pH (pH=8). The results of TEM and DLS tests show the sheet structure of the nano-particles and their Nanoscale dimensions in the base fluid, respectively. The thermal conductivity of the Nano-fluid in the study range indicates a significant increase and its maximum increase is 48.1%. Using the curve fitting method, a new correlational with high accuracy has been proposed. Finally, according to the results obtained, it can be said that the Nano-fluid, with respect to its thermal properties in the practical systems, is an appropriate alternative to water-based fluid.",
