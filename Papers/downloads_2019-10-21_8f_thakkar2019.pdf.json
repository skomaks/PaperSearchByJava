Drilling a well is costly, right from exploration to drilling and production to Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). Nanotechnology has the potential to introduce revolutionary changes in several areas of the oil and gas industry, such as exploration, drilling, cementation, production, EOR, etc. Use of Nanotechnology in the cement slurry can also achieve solutions to some of the problems pertaining to oil well cementation. Nano-silica is a better alternative compared to conventional additives like Calcium Chloride and Silica, because as compared to Calcium Chloride and Silica, the amount of nano-silica to be added is very small. Nano-silica acts as a multi-functional additive. Upon addition of nano-silica to cement slurry, there is a decrease in the thickening time, an increase in the compressive strength, decrease in porosity and permeability within the cement and also a decrease in the fluid loss. Incorporation of nano-silica ensures proper cementation and greater integrity of the well. Nano-silica helps in decreasing the Wait on Cement (WOC) time and therefore reduces the overall capital cost. Nano-silica is highly recommended for deep offshore wells where high temperature and high pressure are often encountered. This paper discusses the behavior of Nano-silica at high temperatures and also reviews effects of Nano-silica on various properties of cement."

      "text" : "The global demand for energy is anticipated to increase over the next decade as the energy consumption is increasing at an alarming rate. The oil industry itself is going through major makeover as conventional oil is about to end. The oil and gas industry is starting to explore challenging areas such as in Deep-water, which exemplifies high economic risks as well as technical problems [1]. Drilling and production of oil from oil wells is becoming an expensive task. Each operation carried out during drilling is costly and each operation is as important as the other. Researchers around the world are trying to find ways to reduce the cost of any of the operations involved during drilling and hence trying to optimize the overall cost of the well. Cementation is one such operation and it is an integral part of well construction in the oil and gas industry [2]. There have been many studies in recent years to improve the mechanical and transfer properties of the cement used for the oil and gas well cementing by using different additives or cement formations [3–6].\nAs a part of drilling operation, a cement slurry is prepared by mixing raw cement with water and other additives and it is run down the casing up to the annulus. Generally, oil well cements are exposed to\ndifferent conditions as compared to cements used in construction industry. The primary objectives of cementing operation are to support and hold the casing, to prevent corrosion of the casing by formation fluids [7]. The purpose of cementing operation is to provide zonal isolation of the formations which have been penetrated by the wellbore. Cement job is also used to close an abandoned portion of the well [7]. It confines abnormal pore pressure and increases the possibility to hit the target. It prevents undesirable migration of the formation fluids in the annulus between casing and hole. Most oil and gas fields around the world have faced traces of gas migration in the annulus [8]. Gas interloping and migration in the annulus can cause many problems and is detrimental to the health of the well [8]. The major reason due to which gas intrudes into the annulus is due to channeling within the cement which occurs due to improper cementation. The aim of every cementation job is to ensure proper setting of cement behind the casing ensuring a negligible probability of channeling.\nCement is used in temperatures ranging from 0 °C in Permafrost to 100 °C in some secondary recovery operations [9]. The quality of cement behind the casing plays an important role during primary cementing as well as during work over and stimulation operation. During completion of a well, it is necessary to have good quality cement behind\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.petlm.2019.06.005 Received 19 September 2018; Received in revised form 14 June 2019; Accepted 18 June 2019\nPeer review under responsibility of Southwest Petroleum University. ∗ Corresponding author.

The strength of oil well cements usually depends on factors such as time and conditions of curing [10,11], environmental conditions [12,13], slurry design and use of additives [14,15] and any additional treatments to which the hardened cement blends are subjected [16–18]. High quality cement provides durability of the borehole by ensuring proper support to the casing. The poor quality of cement behind the casing results in fluid channeling and this may result to remedial cementing and thus the time and cost of the cement job increases.\nMany additives need to be added in the cement to enhance various properties of the cement. The reduction in setting time of cement can be carried out by using accelerators, increase in thickening time of cement can be done by adding retarders, etc. Moreover we can also increase the compressive strength of cement, decrease the fluid loss within cement and increase the density of cement, using different additives. Sodium Chloride and Calcium Chloride can be used as accelerators in the cement slurry to reduce the setting time of the cement. Weighting agents such as Barite or Haematite are widely used to increase the density of cement slurries [19]. Apart from these commonly used additives, many special additives such as thinners, extenders, light weight additives, gas migration additives, corrosion inhibitors, expansion additives, Hydrogen sulphide Scavengers, Oxygen Scavengers are among many that are added to cement depending on the well requirement [20].\nCementing industry currently faces some challenges while drilling wells where low temperatures are encountered. Under these conditions cement slurry takes longer time to set and there is a subsequent increase in cost. Whereas in deep wells where temperature is very high results in early hydration of cement which causes early setting of cement resulting in improper cementation and channeling within the cement. High temperature encountered in deep wells causes a reduction in the viscosity of cement resulting in fluid loss. Generally, cement slurry starts losing its strength when exposed to temperatures higher than 110 °C and this phenomenon is known as cement strength retrogression. This review paper aims to demonstrate a way to mitigate these problems up to some extent.\nIn recent years, the technology of nanostructured materials is developing at an astonishing speed and is being applied extensively to myriad processes. Many efforts have been made to improve the properties of cement by the addition of nanomaterial to the cement. Nanomaterial have already revolutionized many industries and it has also found a wide scope in oil industry too. The conceptual framework of nanotechnology has demonstrated utility across a wide variety of industries, from textiles and defense to aerospace and energy. In Oil and Gas industry, nanomaterials have found applications in Exploration, Reservoir Management, Drilling, Production and Refining and Processing [21]. Nano-silica is used in oil industry for many purposes such as Drag reduction in porous media, foam and emulsion stability in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), Water invasion reduction in shale, Filtration control in fluids and Rheology control in fluids [22].\nThe main reason Nanotechnology is garnering rapid attention is due to the properties that object show when they are formed at nano-scale [23,24]. This is no different in the cement industry, where self-sensing, self-healing, self-cleaning, and strength enhancement are concepts now frequently discussed in the research community [25]. Silica or Silicon Dioxide is found in nature in the form of Quartz or Sand. Control of silica structure at nano-scale level was carried out to generate silica nanoparticles. The inclusion of nanoscale particles in the Portland cement paste, mortar, or concrete can impart functionality into cements yielding a variety of different emergent property enhancements. Several types of metal oxides nanoparticles such has Nano-silica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide, Aluminium Oxide, Copper Oxide, Zinc Peroxide and many other magnetic nanoparticles are been used as additives that are incorporated with cement to minimize many everyday field problems [26]. Generally, nanomaterial induced property enhancements have been observed and reported to include:\na. Early strength development [27]. b. Increased long-term tensile-to-compressive strength ratio [27]. c. Viscosity enhancement [27]. d. Overall increases in the early stage compressive strength [27]. e. Reduction in thickening time of cement [28].\nIt has been established by numerous investigation that concrete properties can be improved by using Nanomaterials. Nanomaterials such as TiO2, ZnO2, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, silica, alumina, and clay have been examined to improve strength, stiffness and ductility characteristics of concrete material. The cost of drilling a deep water well is high and it becomes necessary to optimize the capital cost in any way possible. The cost optimization can be achieved by trying to optimize the cost of each individual operation involved in the project such as cementation. One of the primary ways to reduce the cost of cementing operation is by reducing the overall setting time of the cement. To reduce the wait on cement (WOC) time, which can be very costly, especially in offshore wells, accelerators are used to help cement gain strength faster [29].\nThis paper reviews the effect of nano-silica on cement slurry and how it influences various properties of the cement. This paper discusses the possible benefits of using nano-silica in cement slurry and shows how it can be used as a potential multi-functional additive. This paper also shows a way of carrying out an economic feasibility analysis of incorporating nano-silica in the cement slurry for deep water wells."

      "text" : "Nano-silica is a highly effective pozzolanic material consisting of extremely fine silica that is added to cement slurries for oil field, civil engineering and construction applications [30]. Nano-silica consists of vitreous particles whose size is approximately 1000 times less than the average cement particle size [30]. It improves strength and durability of the cement and decreases permeability within the cement. Nano-silica can increase the compressive strength of the cement, can reduce fluid loss, can reduce porosity and permeability within the cement, and can reduce the setting time of the cement by accelerating the heat of hydration reaction, etcetera. Oil industry can be benefit from the nanosilica. Majority of its applications are found in oil well cementing and further research is going on its economic feasibility and their imposed environmental concerns. With its entailing benefits, nano-silica can be an emerging technology in the cementation arena.\nNano-silica particles fill up the voids between the cement grains and hence create a filler effect [30]. It fills the remaining voids in young and partially hydrated cement paste, ultimately increasing its density [31]. Upon addition of pozzolanic nano-silica in the cement, it provides nucleation sites for cement hydration [32] and it reacts with Calcium Hydroxide during hydration reaction of cement forming an additional C–S–H (Calcium-Silica-Hydrogen) phase responsible for strength development [33]. Nano-silica affects the cement slurry in various ways. They affect the thickening time, compressive strength, fluid loss, porosity and permeability within the cement, etcetera as shown in the Fig. 1."

      "heading" : "2.1. Effect on thickening time and heat of hydration",
      "text" : "Thickening time is the pumpable time of a cement or the time it takes to begin thickening [34]. In deep water and ultra-deep water wells the cost of drilling a well is very high. Researchers and graduates over the globe are trying to find ways to maximize extraction of hydrocarbons from deep and ultra-deep reservoirs at low cost. After the cement is pumped is down the casing and up the annulus, a wait on cement (WOC) time is given to the cement which is basically the time taken by the cement to set. It is during this time that the rig remains idle and the rig cost increases.\nThickening time tests are made at circulating temperatures because\ncement attains the circulating temperature of the well as it is placed but it obtains the actual static formation temperature as it sets and attains strength [35]. The thickening time of cement can be measured in the laboratory. The apparatus required for measuring thickening time of cement consists of a pressurized consistometer which has a rotating cylindrical slurry container, equipped with a stationary paddle assembly. The first step is to load the slurry in the slurry container and to place the slurry in a pressure vessel. The temperature and pressure are increased or decreased according to the decided schedule [36].\nParticularly, the thickening time increases with decrease in temperature. This causes a problem when low temperatures are encountered. On decreasing temperature from 90 °C to 70 °C, there is a 178% increase in the thickening time [37]. Upon further lowering the temperature, thickening time still increases [37]. With addition of nano-silica there is a reduction in the thickening time of cement slurry.\nWhen cement slurries with increasing weight percent of nano-silica were studied, it was palpable that as the percentage of nano-silica in the cement slurry was increased, the thickening time of the cement slurry decreased. When comparison was made between slurry containing 0% nano-silica and slurry containing 1% nano-silica, 80.25% reduction in thickening time was reported [28]. This is an enormous reduction in the thickening time. When comparison was made between slurry containing 1% nano-silica and slurry containing 1.5% nano-silica, a 36.7% reduction in thickening time was reported [28]. Further addition of nano-silica reduces the thickening time of cement slurry. When comparison was made between slurry containing 1.5% nano-silica and slurry containing 2% nano-silica, a 7% reduction in thickening time was reported [28]. When comparison was made between slurry containing 2% nano-silica and slurry containing 3% nano-silica, a 24.7% reduction in thickening time was reported [28]. Some literature report that optimum performance can be achieved by adding nano-silica in quantity equivalent to 1% By Weight Of Cement (BWOC) [28] while some suggest the quantity of nano-silica to be added should be equivalent to 2% BWOC [38]. The mechanism behind this is related to high surface area of nano-silica, because it works as a nucleation site for the precipitation of CSH gel [31].\nHydration is defined as a chemical reaction in which compounds in cement form chemical bonds with water molecules and become hydrates [39]. When Portland cement mixes with water, heat is liberated and this heat is known as heat of hydration [40]. It is the result of an exothermic reaction between cement and water [40]. The more is the speed of hydration reaction in the cement slurry, the less is the time taken by cement to set. At low temperatures, the heat of hydration\nreaction occurs slowly and at high temperatures, the heat of hydration reaction occurs at a rapid speed.\nWhen cement slurries, each containing different additives like Calcium Chloride, Nano-silica, Silica Fume, Microsand, Alumina are compared with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), hydration reaction speed of nano-silica is quicker as compared to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) [15,47,50]. The amount of nano-silica incorporated in to the cement slurry was ranging from 0.45% to 0.9% [41]. However, it has not yet been determined whether the rapid hydration of cement in presence of nano-silica occurs due to its pozzolanic activity or due to their considerable surface activity [42]."

      "heading" : "2.2. Effect on compressive strength",
      "text" : "Cementing faces a challenge at low temperatures, where there is slower heat of hydration reaction due to which cement takes more time to set resulting into a reduction in the compressive strength of cement. Upon investigating the relationship between compressive strength of cement slurry and temperature, it was found that at low temperatures, the compressive strength of the slurry is less. It becomes necessary to ensure cement integrity and compressive strength of cement at low temperatures. Adding nano-silica in the cement slurry can effectively increase the compressive strength of cement slurry at low temperatures. An economic feasibility study should be carried out before incorporating nano-silica in the cement slurry.\nNano-silica is capable of increasing the density of concrete and improves the mechanical properties of concrete [43]. It promotes pozzolanic reaction resulting in enhancement of durability and mechanical properties of cement [44]. It has been observed that with increasing weight percent of nano-silica, the compressive strength of the cement increases. However, if the proportion of nano-silica in the cement slurry exceeds some certain amount there can be a decrease in the compressive strength of cement.\nWhen cement slurries with increasing weight percent of nano-silica were studied [28], a trend of increasing compressive strength was observed. When comparison was made between slurry containing 0% nano-silica and slurry containing 1% nano-silica, a 100% increase in compressive strength was reported [28]. Slurry with 1% nano-silica demonstrated maximum compressive strength [28]. It was observed that the compressive strength of slurry containing 1.5% nano-silica was 7% lower as compared to slurry containing 1% nano-silica [28]. Addition of nano-silica improves the bond between cement matrix and aggregates [45–52]. This helps in producing concrete with high\nFig. 1. Different roles of nano-silica in oil well cement.\ncompressive strength. As compared to Fly Ash, Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and Silica Fume, nano-silica has high compressive strength [53]. The compressive strength of NS is 9.5% of that of OPC [53]. This is enough evidence that upon addition of nano-silica in cement slurry, the compressive strength of cement slurry can drastically increase [53]. Upon incorporation of nano-silica in cement, with increase in the compressive strength of cement, an increase in viscosity is also reported [54]."

      "heading" : "2.3. Effect on porosity and permeability",
      "text" : "Porosity is a parameter which can be defined as the fraction of void volume over the total volume and permeability is defined as the measure of connectivity of pores. In cementation, it is necessary to have minimum porosity and permeability within the cement. The primary function of casing is to seal the casing from the wellbore. The cement behind the casing bears the pressure of fluids coming from the wellbore. If the cement is porous and permeable, there can be cracks and channels within the cement which can be very dangerous. The formation fluids coming towards wellbore incident on cement and if there is channeling within the cement this formation fluid rise up to the surface. Hence, this may lead to remedial cementing which can increase the cost of cementation and this migration of formation fluids can be hazardous and can risk the lives of drilling personnel. Thus, it becomes necessary to reduce the porosity and permeability within the cement. In cementing operations, various additives are added to reduce the porosity and permeability within the cement. With the advent of nanotechnology this can be carried out more efficiently. Nano-silica can reduce the porosity and permeability within the cement to a great extent [28] and can minimize the possibility of channeling within the cement and decreasing the possibility of gas migration.\nWhen porosity and permeability of cement slurries with different amount of nano-silica were observed, the results showed that with increasing amount of nano-silica there was a subsequent decrease in both the properties up to a certain extent [28]. With the addition of just 1% of nano-silica to the cement slurry, the porosity was reduced significantly by 15% and it also resulted in a drastic decrease in permeability. While the addition of more nano-silica to cement slurry didn't result in an effective change in permeability and porosity. Thus, the decrease in porosity and permeability in the cement slurry is maximum when the addition of nano-silica ranges from 0.01% to 0.9% [28]. Nano-silica reacts with Calcium Hydroxide crystals and reduces their size and amount and binds the cement paste denser [55]. Nano-silica gel fills the voids of CSH gel structure and acts as a nucleus to tightly bond with CSH gel particles [31].\nWhen an air permeability test was carried out on cured concrete with different percentages of nano-silica, it was observed that concrete with 0% nano-silica, permeability observed was highest and as the percentage of nano-silica was increased in the concrete, a reduction on the porosity and permeability was observed within the cement [56]. There is a slight increase in porosity of the cement after reaching the critical value."

      "heading" : "2.4. Effect on fluid loss",
      "text" : "In cementing operations, loss of water can adversely affect the performance of slurry and can lead to improper cementation. It is necessary to add a chemical additive to control the loss of fluid to the formation through filtration. For more than 20 years, fluid loss control agents have been added to cement slurries it is generally acknowledged that a lack of fluid loss control may be responsible for primary cement failures [57].\nWhen cement slurry samples with different amount of nano-silica were observed, the results showed that as the percentage of nano-silica in the cement slurry increased, the fluid loss decreased. Slurry with 1% nano-silica reported a decrease in fluid loss up to 43%. Similarly, with\nincreasing amount of nano-silica, a gradual decrease in fluid loss was observed [28].\nIt is evident from previous discussion that incorporation of nanosilica in cement slurry reduces the pore size. Pores of smaller size lose lesser water and hence fluid loss is alleviated [58]. The fine particles of nano-silica are well placed between empty pores of cement matrix and does not allow the solid phase of slurry to be separated from liquid, hence water in the slurry cannot leave the cement matrix and as a result there is a reduction in the fluid loss [28].\nFluid loss in mud infused with nano-silica increases as the concentration of nano-silica increases [59]. The excessive amount of nanoparticle do not have the ability to fill the tiny pores present in the mud cake because of which it generates very high fluid loss [59]."

      "heading" : "2.5. At high temperatures",
      "text" : "With conventional oil and gas on the verge of scarcity and with the advent of new technologies it has been possible to tap unconventional hydrocarbon present in deep and ultra-deep reservoirs. The risk involved in the extraction of unconventional hydrocarbon is great as high temperature and high pressures are encountered.\nFor cementation of deep wells with high temperatures, special quality cement is required which should have high density, good rheological qualities with mechanical and thermal stability and high compressive strength [60]. Wells are classified as high temperature high pressure (HPHT) when the bottom hole temperature exceeds 250 °F (121 °C) and pressure more than 2.28 g/cm3 (19 ppg) Equivalent mud weight (EMV) density [61]. At high temperature, conventional cement or Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) struggles to develop strength and hence integrity of well is compromised. The cement sets early due to accelerated heat of hydration reaction occurring due to presence of high temperature. Although cement sets early which can be a benefit, but due to accelerated heat of hydration reaction the cement sets improperly. In case of Geothermal wells, there is a possibility of water flow into the cement column, which increases water to cement ratio and it could cause cracks within the cement [62]. The presence of channels within the cement can lead to gas migration which poses as an imminent threat. It can lead to remedial cementing which further increases the cost and it sometimes leads to deleterious results. Upon addition of nano-silica in cement slurry, channeling within the cement can be mitigated and as a result there is little to no gas migration.\nGeopolymer cement can also be used to mitigate this problem but it has more compressive strength than class G cement only when the temperature ranges from 36 °C to 80 °C [63]. Hence, it becomes necessary to slow down the heat of hydration reaction at high temperatures and ensure proper integrity of cement to eliminate channeling within the cement and to eliminate gas migration. When nanoparticles are mixed with Geopolymer cement, the strength reduction at high temperatures and high pressures is mitigated [63]. Hence, incorporation of nano-silica in the cement enhances the integrity and durability of the well. Research and studies are going on to determine their extent of usage and feasibility in the HPHT oil well cementation."

      "text" : "Nano-silica activates pozzolanic reaction, resulting in enhancement of durability of cement [64]. Nano-silica is an attractive technology because it mitigates the possibility of costly cement repair jobs. But not every technology is a one hundred percent perfect and accurate. Despite its impeccable benefits, nano-silica suffers some minor drawbacks. From Indian perspective, cost of purchasing nano-silica can be a deciding factor but as far as global scenario is concerned cost is not of much concern. Besides from the economic point of view, nano-silica can unnecessarily increase the viscosity at a required slurry density. Nanosilica can cause pumpabilty and air entrainment issues. The other problem that is faced is the inability to determine how much quantity of\nnano-silica should be added to the cement to achieve greatest performance [65]. Some literature reports that the quantity should be 1% By weight Of Cement (BWOC) whereas some literature recommend at least 2% to achieve better performance [28]."

      "heading" : "4. Cementation economics",
      "text" : "The cost of cementation roughly accounts to 10% to 15% of the overall cost of the well depending on depth of well, size of well, type of cement used, amount of additives, wait on cement (WOC) time and the casing program.\nDrilling costs make up to 25–35% of the total development costs for an offshore field (Overview of Drilling Operations, Heriot Watt University).\nThe following tables show the overall economics of particular wells. Table 1 shows the breakdown of costs for a North Sea Well (Overview of Drilling Operations, Heriot Watt University). The cost of the cementation is $282,000 which is equivalent to 3% of the overall well cost. Table 2 gives the time breakdown for a North Sea Well (Fixed platform) (Overview of Drilling Operations, Heriot Watt University). The time taken by cementing operations is approximately 18 Hours which is equivalent to 1.4%.\nThe following tables demonstrate that the cost of cementation is high especially in offshore wells. The high costs of cementing operation are influenced primarily by the wait on cement (WOC) time i.e. the idle rig time. Hence it becomes necessary to find an equivalent additive which can significantly reduce the setting time of cement and thus reducing the Wait of Cement (WOC) time reflecting in the optimization of rig cost. In conventional cementing operations, different additives are added to enhance different properties of cement. For Example, Calcium Chloride is added as an accelerator to reduce the setting time of cement, Calcium Lignosulphonates are added as Retarders, Bentonite is added to reduce the slurry density, Barite is added as a heavy additive, organic polymers are added as Fluid loss additives, etcetera. The addition of different additives is costly. They on one hand enhance the property of the cement but on the other hand they compromise the compressive strength if the cement. The integrity of cement is of utmost importance especially in an offshore well, where improper cementation can lead to remedial cementing and in some cases, loss of lives. The Industry needs high integrity of cement which can sustain at High Temperature, High\nPressure conditions. There is a need for a Multi-functional additive which can enhance many properties of the cement without compromising the compressive strength of the cement. This is where nanomaterials find their application.\nNano-silica does increase the compressive strength of cement and does decrease the porosity and permeability within the cement [28]. But from an economic point of view, incorporation of nano-silica in the cement slurry should be economically feasible. An economic feasibility study can be carried out to determine that whether it would be pragmatic to use nano-silica in the cement slurry given its high cost. It sure carries a lot of advantages but after incorporation of nano-silica in the cement slurry one should not occur loss. A feasibility slurry can be proposed as such that the study should contain two sides, that is, cash inflow which will account for the additional cost of incorporating nanosilica in the cement slurry (generally it ranges from $1200-$1500 per kilogram) and the cash outflow which should contain the money saved due to reduction in the rig time (which occurs due to a reduced setting time of cement and hence a reduced idle rig time). On comparing this cash inflow and cash outflow, we can get a generalized idea that whether the addition of nano-silica in cement slurry is economically feasible or not. With proper well data, rig data and cement data this analysis can be carried out."

      "heading" : "5. Conclusions",
      "text" : "Offshore oil and gas industry faces myriad challenges and majority of those challenges are related to cash flow. Offshore projects involve a lot of initial investments and the industry is continuously innovating for it to face the challenges overlaid by the extreme offshore conditions. Along with it the safety of the personnel should be the foremost priority of the company. Numerous efforts have been put to use to reduce the cost of an offshore projects. One such method is the incorporation of Nano-silica in oil well cement. Nano-silica exhibits a multitude of advantages and petroleum industry stands to procure various benefits from it. Nanoslilica increases the compressive strength of cement, decreases the thickening time of cement, decreases the porosity and permeability within the cement, reduces channeling within the cement and eliminates the risk of gas migration at high temperature and decreases the fluid loss within the cement. It is highly recommended for cementing operations of a well because it helps in reducing the Wait On Cement (WOC) time of cement ultimately helping in reducing the rig cost and hence reducing the overall cost of the well. It is useful in extreme offshore conditions where initial oil in place is excessive. Apart\nfrom the cost perspective, in offshore conditions, it is also a better alternative to conventional cement because cement incorporated with nano-silica assures strong integrity of cement which ensures a stable well bore and along with it assures the safety of the personnel."

Nanotechnology has the potential to introduce revolutionary changes in several areas of the oil and gas industry, such as exploration, drilling, cementation, production, EOR, etc. Use of Nanotechnology in the cement slurry can also achieve solutions to some of the problems pertaining to oil well cementation. Nano-silica is a better alternative compared to conventional additives like Calcium Chloride and Silica, because as compared to Calcium Chloride and Silica, the amount of nano-silica to be added is very small. Nano-silica acts as a multi-functional additive. Upon addition of nano-silica to cement slurry, there is a decrease in the thickening time, an increase in the compressive strength, decrease in porosity and permeability within the cement and also a decrease in the fluid loss. Incorporation of nano-silica ensures proper cementation and greater integrity of the well. Nano-silica helps in decreasing the Wait on Cement (WOC) time and therefore reduces the overall capital cost. Nano-silica is highly recommended for deep offshore wells where high temperature and high pressure are often encountered. This paper discusses the behavior of Nano-silica at high temperatures and also reviews effects of Nano-silica on various properties of cement.",
