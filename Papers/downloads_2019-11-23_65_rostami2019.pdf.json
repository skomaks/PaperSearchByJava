In this research, the laboratory process of preparation, the stability andmeasurement of the thermal conductivity of a newhybrid nanofluidwere performed. The hybrid nanofluidwas prepared by suspending a combination of copper oxide and graphene oxide in antifreeze. At first, the characterization of nanoparticles was performed to investigate the surface and atomic structure of the nano-materials using XRD & FESEM tests. The nanofluid was produced by a two-step method, and its stability was investigated using both sedimentation mapping and DLS testing. The DLS results showed the samples had anano structure. Themeasurement of the thermal conductivity of the hybrid nanofluidwas carried out using a KD2-Pro thermal analyzer and a KS-1 sensor in a temperature range of 25–50 °C with volume concentration range of 0–1.6%. The results of the experiments showed that the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid is a function of volume fraction and temperature. Moreover, the effects of temperature on thermal conductivity were more evident in more concentrated samples. It was also observed that the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid increased by 43.4%. In the end, using a curve fit method and based on experimental results, an experimental correlation with high precision was presented to predict the thermal conductivity of hybrid nanofluid. Therefore, according to the results, it was understood that this nano-antifreeze could be used as an alternative fluid with high heat transfer potential in thermal systems.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

      "text" : "Water is one of the liquid materials and the most abundant compound on the surface of the planet. It has very special properties that distinguish it fromother liquids. Special properties include high thermal capacity, abnormal increase in volume during freezing, high surface tension, very low viscosity and high latent heat of phase change. Thewater density is 998 kg/m3 at 25 °C and the atmospheric pressure. Thewater is boiling at 100 °C and frozen at 0 °C. Due to its special properties, water is abundantly used in various industries. For example, water is used in heat exchangers, chillers, internal combustion engines, solar water heaters and so on [1–4]. With all these positive points for water, there are two major weaknesses in terms of its use in thermal applications. The first is the freezing point of 0 °C, which limits the use of water in subzero conditions. The second problem is that the water has a thermal conductivity of 0.6 W/m.K which is a low value and reduces the heat transfer rate.\nThe first problem (freezing point) can be solved by adding ethylene glycol to water. For example, if the water and ethylene glycol aremixed in a 50–50% volume proportion, the freezing point is reduced to -37 °C.\nn).\nThis mixture is called antifreeze. However, the addition of ethylene glycol towater reduces the thermal conductivity of the water. The solution to this problem, proposed by Choi since 1995 [5], is the addition of solid nanoparticles. These solid particles, which can bemetal or non-metallic, have a much higher thermal conductivity compared to the antifreeze. Many researchers have studied and simulated nanofluids in recent years, which has led to better recognition of their thermophysical properties [6–14]. For example, Adhami Dehkordi et al. [15] experimented the antifreeze that the base fluid was a composition of 50:50 vol% mixture of ethylene glycol andwater. They have performed their experiments in various volume fractions of 0.025, 0.055, 0.08, 0.125, 0.25, 0.53 and 0.65% for the functionalized single walled carbon nanotubes. Then, they have proved that the thermal conductivity augmentation was depended on improving the concentration and temperature; also in greater volume fraction (φ N 0.53%), the greater effect on the nanofluids thermal conductivity could be affected by increasing the temperature. Afrand et al. [16] studied the thermal conductivity of Fe3O4 magnetic nanofluids in two-step preparing method which Fe3O4 nanoparticles with the solid volume fractions of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1, 2 and 3% were dispersed into the water under temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 55 °C. Moreover, they have presented a new correlation employing experimental data in order to predict the thermal conductivity ratio of the magnetic nanofluids. On the other hand, as it was shown in\nexperimental improvements maximum enhancement was about 90% that occurred at solid volume fraction of 3.0% and temperature of 55 °C. Soltanimehr and Afrand [17] examined the thermal conductivity of MWCNTs/EG–water hybrid nanofluid that was prepared by a two-step method. In their study, the base fluidwas a 40:60 vol%mixture of ethylene glycol and water. Their experiments were performed for solid volume fractions of 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.75 and 1% at temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 50 °C. Their results illustrated that by increasing the solid volume fraction to 1.0% and temperature up to 50 °C there was a 34.7% thermal conductivity of nanofluid maximum increment. Toghraie et al. [18] tested how thermal conductivity of ZnO–TiO2/EG hybrid nanofluids could be affected by temperature and nanoparticles concentration. The experiments were accomplished at temperature\nranging from 25 to 50 °C and solid volume fraction range of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5%. The Results portended that therewas a phenomenal increase in thermal conductivity with higher temperature and solid volume fraction. Their experimental results showed that themaximum thermal conductivity enhancement of the nanofluid was 32%, which occurred at the highest temperature and volume fraction. Moreover, they reported that the variation of thermal conductivity growth in greater temperature so did in greater solid volume fraction comparing with lowers of them. Afrand [19] investigated the thermal conductivity of ethylene glycol (EG) as the base fluid and the effect of hybrid nanoadditives containing magnesium oxide and functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes. His experiments were implemented for solid volume fractions of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6% and temperatures\nranging from 25 to 50 °C. He reported that raising the percentage of the solid volume fraction caused improvement of the thermal conductivity of nanofluids considerably up to 21.3%. Furthermore, he has an admirable effort to reach a correlation to estimate the thermal conductivity with differentiation in temperatures and concentrations. The effect of the magnetic field on nanofluids behavior also has a direct effect, since\nFig. 1. The equipment used to production the nanofluid. A: D\nmagnetic nanoparticles change the thermal and rheological behavior of nanofluids [20,21].\nAmong the nano-materials studied by various scientists, copper and graphene have suitable thermal properties. Therefore, some researchers examined the thermal conductivity of nanofluids containing copper oxide (CuO) or graphene oxide (GO). A review of the parameters studied and their findings are presented in Table 1.\nAs mentioned above, among the nanoparticles studied by various scientists, copper oxide and graphene have good thermal properties. For example, a sheet of graphene plates mixed with spherical copper particles can provide a good combination for stability and thermal conductivity. The literature review showed that the combination of these two nano-additives has not yet been considered. Therefore, due to the frequency of antifreeze application, in this study for the first time, the combination of graphene oxide and copper oxide nano-additives in water-ethylene glycol base fluid has been dispersed. The nanofluid stability is checked by two methods of precipitation and DLS testing. The thermal conductivity of thehybrid nanofluid ismeasured in the temperature range of 25 to 50 °C and the volume fractions of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6%. Moreover, the results of the experiments, along with the results of the analysis of data, are presented as comparative graphs. At the end, in order to calculate the values of the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid, an experimental correlation is presented to calculate the ratio of thermal conductivity changes of the hybrid nanofluid in terms of temperature and volume fraction of the nano-additives.\nigital Scale.

Preparing nanofluids\nCombination of nanoparticles in various volume fractions has been used in this researchwith the approach of improving thermal properties of water-ethylene glycol base fluid. Water-ethylene glycol base fluid is with 50: 50 volume fraction because this fluid is extensively used in industry so it is used under various working conditions such as high or negative temperature. The characteristics of the used base fluid are shown in Table 2.\nIn this research, a combination of graphene oxide and copper oxide nanoparticles were used with a 50:50 volume fraction. Graphene oxide nanoparticles are from carbon materials. Therefore, they have the potential for high thermal properties because of their plate structure and created carbon bonds in these nanoparticles. Graphene oxide nanoparticle has a high actual cost.\nCopper oxide nanoparticles relatively have high thermal conductivity and cost of these nanoparticles is less than the cost of graphene oxide\nnanoparticles. Table 3 shows the thermos-physical properties and characteristics.\nFESEM & XRD tests were conducted to specify nanoparticles and their surface and atomic structure, and the obtained results are shown in results and discussion.\nGetting the reliable and steady properties in nano-fluids need to make long-term sustainability in them. Two-step method was used in this research for nano-fluid sustainability and construction. First, the mentioned volume fractions were determined based on experimental design and then the mass of materials was determined for per 60 ml made nano-fluid by considering base fluid properties and nanoparticles and using Eq. (1). Mass of base fluids and nanomaterials are shown in Table 4.\nϕ ¼ m ρ GO þ mρ CuO\nm ρ\nGO\nþ mρ CuO þ mρ H2O þ mρ EG\n100 ð1Þ\nMass of materials was measured by AND GF 300 digital scale (Fig. 1A) to make the final experimental samples in this research and magnetic stirrer RET BASIC model was used in 60 min to mix the materials (Fig. 1B). Nanoparticles were added to the base fluid step by step. Finally, the ultrasonic device was used to make a long-term sustainability and breaking particles aggregations. This device is used for nano-fluid suspension process. Ultra-sonication device is used to change an electric flow to themechanical vibrationwhichmakes the solution to be homogeneous.

Examining nano-fluid sustainability\nDLS physical test is used to determine the present particles size distribution in nano-fluid. This method was non-destructive and determines the speed of particles size from several nm to μm. The diffracted light changes by time in suspension by the included nanoparticles. The particle diameter is determined in this test using the interactions connections between light and particle. DLS test results are shown in Fig. 6.\nIn this experiment, with the collision of a laser beam with a wavelength of 657 nm to solution, containing a mixture of graphene oxide/ copper oxide nanoparticles, the information about their size range is obtained according to Mie theory [57]. Fig. 6 shows the average size of the existing nanoparticles in terms of the intensity of the laser beam from the surface of the particles. In fact, based on the physics governing laser beam conditions, larger particles diffract more beam intensity,\nand smaller particles naturally produce less intensity. The results show that the largest particle size is 67 nm, and the particle size range is also observed. According to the results, the particle size is b100 nm, and the nanosilver stability can be confirmed."

      "heading" : "3.3. The effect of temperature on thermal conductivity of nano-fluid",
      "text" : "Increasing temperature always improves the thermal conductivity of various materials such as water, glycol, and nanomaterials. The thermal conductivity of nanomaterials is higher than other fluids and results show that adding nanomaterials to the base fluid increases their thermal conductivity compared with the mode without adding nanomaterials. The effect of temperature increase on the thermal conductivity of the combined nano-fluid is observed in Fig. 7. Temperature range of this research is 25–50 °C. Results show that thermal\nconductivity increased by higher slope by increasing temperature, and the maximum thermal conductivity is related to the highest temperature of test. One of the most important reasons for increasing thermal conductivity of nano-fluid by temperature is parameters like increasing the Brownianmotion of particles. The fundamentals of these reasons are presented by Mahian et al. [58,59].\nIn Fig. 8, the thermal conductivity ratio of nanofluid in terms of temperature in various volume fractions is shown. This figure shows that as the temperature rises, the thermal conductivity increases. Themain reason for increasing the thermal conductivity with increasing temperature can be explained by Brownian motion and an increase in random collisions between particles. In fact, when the nano-additives volume fraction and temperature increase the nano-additives energy level increase and the particles collide with each other, thereby increasing the heat transfer. In all fractions of volumes, the effect of temperature is always increasing. The thermal conductivity ratio of the nanofluid is defined by Eq. (2).\nThermal conductivity ratio %ð Þ ¼ knf kbf\nð2Þ\nIn which, knf and kbf are the thermal conductivities of nanofluid and base fluid, respectively."

The volume ratio of combined nanoparticles is 50-50. Results show that increasing the volume fraction of the nanoparticles in base fluid increases the thermal conductivity of nano-fluid in a way that the maximum volume fraction of thermal conductivity of nano-fluid has increased 43.4% compared with the base fluid. This incremental procedure is observable for all concentrations. This procedure is because of increasing the present solid particles in a base fluid and higher thermal conductivity of solid than fluids. The one reason of increasing thermal conductivity of nano-fluid is making the made chains from nanoparticles by increasing volume fraction and particles clustering. These phenomena can influence on thermal conductivity of nano-fluids. The size of clusters is a function of nanoparticles dimensions and volume fraction of solid particles in nano-fluids. In fact, In\nnanofluid flows, there are two types of forces, repulsion and attraction that can affect the stability.\nFig. 10 shows the thermal conductivity ratio of nano-fluid based on the volume fraction of nanoparticles. This ratio increases by increasing volume fraction. The incremental slope of the figure shows the effect of volume fraction vs. temperature in a way that adding negligible amounts of nanoparticle increases the thermal conductivity of nanofluid than base fluid significantly.

In this research, the laboratory process of preparation, the stability andmeasurement of the thermal conductivity of a newhybrid nanofluidwere performed. The hybrid nanofluidwas prepared by suspending a combination of copper oxide and graphene oxide in antifreeze. At first, the characterization of nanoparticles was performed to investigate the surface and atomic structure of the nano-materials using XRD & FESEM tests. The nanofluid was produced by a two-step method, and its stability was investigated using both sedimentation mapping and DLS testing. The DLS results showed the samples had anano structure. Themeasurement of the thermal conductivity of the hybrid nanofluidwas carried out using a KD2-Pro thermal analyzer and a KS-1 sensor in a temperature range of 25–50 °C with volume concentration range of 0–1.6%. The results of the experiments showed that the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid is a function of volume fraction and temperature. Moreover, the effects of temperature on thermal conductivity were more evident in more concentrated samples. It was also observed that the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid increased by 43.4%. In the end, using a curve fit method and based on experimental results, an experimental correlation with high precision was presented to predict the thermal conductivity of hybrid nanofluid. Therefore, according to the results, it was understood that this nano-antifreeze could be used as an alternative fluid with high heat transfer potential in thermal systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
