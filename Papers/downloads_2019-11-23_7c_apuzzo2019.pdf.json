According to this model, the bending moment is expressed by integral convolutions of elastic flexural curvature and of its derivative with the special bi-exponential averaging kernel. It has been recently proven that such a relation is equivalent to a differential equation, involving bending moment and flexural curvature fields, equipped with natural higher-order boundary conditions of constitutive type. The associated elastostatic problem of a Bernoulli-Euler functionally graded nanobeam is formulated and solved for simple statical schemes of technical interest. An effective analytical approach is presented and exploited to establish exact expressions of nonlocal strain gradient transverse displacements of doubly clamped, cantilever, clampedsimply supported and simply supported nano-beams, detecting thus also new benchmarks for numerical analyses. Comparisons with results of literature, corresponding to selected higher-order boundary conditions are provided and discussed. The considered nonlocal strain gradient model can be advantageously adopted to characterize scale phenomena in nano-engineering problems.\n1. Introduction\nIn recent years new and multifunctional materials have been introduced requiring the consideration of small length scales [1,2]. From an engineering standpoint, the realization of nano-actuators, nanosensors, 3D printings and structural components for micro- and nanosystems has become an important topic, see e.g. the review papers [3,4] and the contributions [5–16]. Since mechanical properties are size-dependent at the nanoscale, the study of size effects on the behavior of nano-beams is an important area of research. It is well-known that the classical continuum theory neglects structural phenomena that are important at small-scales [17–30]. Accordingly new non-classical continuum theories can be adopted to model the size-dependency of microand nano-scale structures such as strain-driven and stress-driven nonlocal elasticity [31–34]. The strain-driven nonlocal elastic model has been introduced by Eringen [35] and the nonlocal stress is obtained in terms of the integral convolution of the elastic strain with a smoothing kernel. Such a model cannot be adopted to assess size-effects in nanomechanics, as proved in Ref. [36] and agreeded in several papers such as [37,38]. Actually, the ill-posedness of Eringen's strain-driven purely\nnonlocal elastic model for bounded domains relies on the fact that the constitutive boundary conditions associated with Eringen's integral law conflict with equilibrium requirements, see Refs. [39,40]. The stressdriven nonlocal elastic model for nano-beams has been provided in Ref. [41] and the nonlocal elastic strain is obtained in terms of the integral convolution of the stress with a smoothing kernel. This model leads to well-posed nonlocal problems for structures defined on bounded domains, see e.g. Refs. [42–45]. A recent approach proposed in Ref. [46] merges Eringen's nonlocal strain-driven integral law with the strain gradient elasticity to obtain a higher-order nonlocal theory. The nonlocal stress is defined as the sum of two integral terms: the former is Eringen's convolution between the elastic strain and a smoothing kernel depending on a nonlocal parameter and the latter is the derivative of the convolution of the elastic strain gradient with a smoothing kernel depending on a nonlocal parameter. If the bi-exponential function is considered for the smoothing kernel, the solution of the nonlocal problem is achieved, in literature, by replacing the integral law with the differential law which is considered to be equivalent to the integral relation. The main problem is that such a differential equation is of higher-order than the one of the classical local problem.

In literature, two different choices are provided consisting in imposing higher-order kinematic [47] or static [48] boundary conditions pertaining to the strain gradient theory. It is worth noting that the nonlocal structural response is particularly affected by these choices. A definitive answer to the discussion on the higher-order boundary conditions to be imposed in order to solve the elastostatic problem of nonlocal strain gradient nano-beams has been provided in Ref. [49]. It is proved that such boundary conditions follow from the nonlocal strain gradient integral law and turns out to be of constitutive kind. It is also shown in Ref. [49] that the differential problem, equipped with the correct constitutive boundary conditions, leads to well-posed elastostatic problems for bounded nano-structures. The nonlocal strain gradient elastic model is utilized in the present paper to address the sizedependent static behavior of inflected nano-beams of technical interest. Small-scale effects are exhibited by nano-beams for any boundary condition. In particular, closed form solutions for the nonlocal strain gradient model are given for cantilever, simply-supported, clampedsimply supported and fully-clamped FG nano-beams subject to a uniform load. It is shown that nano-beams exhibit softening and stiffening structural behaviors for increasing nonlocal and gradient parameters respectively, so that the nonlocal strain gradient methodology provides an effective approach to design a wide class of nanodevices. If the gradient parameter vanishes, the constitutive boundary conditions of the nonlocal strain gradient law coincide to the ones of Eringen's nonlocal integral law given in Ref. [36]. Numerical analyses are provided as benchmarks for applications and experiments involving inflected nano-beams.\n2. Nonlocal strain gradient model for Bernoulli-Euler nano-beams\nNonlocal strain gradient (NSG) model of elasticity for inflected nano-beams, according to the approach proposed in Ref. [46], is formulated by expressing the bending moment M in terms of elastic flexural curvature el and of its derivative x el as\n=\n=\nM x l K x l K x\nx x K x dx l x x K x dx\n( , , , ) ( ( ))( , ) ( ( ))( , )\n( ¯, ) ( )( ¯) ¯ ( ¯, ) ( )( ¯) ¯. el x x el\nL el x L x el\n0 1 0 0 2 1 1\n0 0 0 2 0 1 1 ¯\n(1)\nWe consider a straight beam of length L, the x-coordinate is taken along the axial direction, with the y-coordinate along the thickness and the z-coordinate along the width of the nano-beam.\nThe local elastic bending stiffness is =K IE , where =I E y y dA( )E 2 is the second moment of the field of Euler-Young elastic moduli E along the y bending axis. The smoothing kernels 0 and 1 depend on two nondimensional non-local parameters 0 > 0 and 1 > 0. The characteristic length l 0 has been introduced to make dimensionally homogeneous the convolutions in Eq. (1). Following [46,47], we consider that the nonlocal parameters are coincident, i.e. λ =: 0 = 1, and the kernels 0 and 1 are coincident with the bi-exponential averaging function given by\n=x c c\nx c ( , ) 1 2 exp | | , (2)\nbeing =c L the characteristic length of Eringen's nonlocal elasticity. The bi-exponential function fulfils positivity, symmetry, normalisation and impulsivity. Introducing the following fields [46]\n=\n=\nM x c x x c K x dx\nM x c l l x x c K x dx\n( , ) ( ¯, ) ( )( ¯) ¯\n( , , ) ( ¯, ) ( )( ¯) ¯,\nL el\nx L\nx el\n0 0 1 2\n0 ¯ (3)\nthe nonlocal strain gradient elastic law Eq. (1) can then be rewritten as\n=M x c l M x c M x c l( , , ) ( , ) ( , , ).x0 1 (4)\nSince the bi-exponential averaging kernel Eq. (2) is the Green function on the whole real axis of Helmholtz linear differential operator L = c1c x2 2 , the differential constitutive relation ensuing the nonlocal strain gradient law Eq. (4) can be written as\n=K x l K x M x c l c M x c l( )( ) ( )( ) ( , , ) ( , , ).el x el x2 2 2 2 (5)\nIt is proved in Ref. [49] that the nonlocal strain gradient integral relation Eq. (4) is not equivalent to the differential law Eq. (5) for nanobeams defined on a bounded interval L[0, ]. In fact suitable boundary conditions must be prescribed to ensure the constitutive equivalence according to the following proposition proved in Ref. [49].\nProposition 1.

Static flexural analysis\nTo demonstrate the differences in the flexural results of the proposed nonlocal model and the existing models in the literature, a flexural beam problem with the Bernoulli-Euler kinematics is investigated. The well-established differential and classical boundary conditions of static equilibrium may be expressed as\n= = = M x q M v M v ( ) ( )| ( ) | 0. x\nx L x L\n2\n0, 0, (9)\nAssuming coincidence of elastic and total flexural curvatures =el and employing the differential equation of equilibrium in addition to the condition of kinematic compatibility = vx2 , the bending moment introduced in Eq. (7) can be expressed as\n= +M x c q K v x l K v x( ) ( )( ) ( )( )x x x2 2 2 2 2 (10)\nIn terms of beam deflection, the differential governing equation takes the form\n=K v x l K v x q c q( )( ) ( )( )x x x x x2 2 2 4 2 2 2 (11)\nequipped with the classical boundary conditions Eq. (9)2 and the constitutive boundary conditions Eq. (8). Employing the proposed nonlocal model, exact solutions are established for inflected nanobeams, with standard boundary conditions, under distributed loading systems. For a uniformly distributed load q0, the analytical displacement solution of the nano-beam, Eq. (11), is expressed by\n= + + + + + +v x q x K x l l x l l x x x( ) 24 exp exp0 4 1 4 2 4 3 3 4 2 5 6\n(12)\nwhere = …k( 1, ,6)k are unknown constants to be determined by suitable boundary conditions including the well-known classical boundary conditions Eq. (9)2 and the constitutive boundary conditions Eq. (8). The exact analytical solutions for flexure problem of Bernoulli-Euler nano-beams will be also compared with the counterpart results introduced in the literature by prescribing different kind of higher-order constitutive boundary conditions. Assuming coincidence of elastic and total flexural curvatures =el , the higher-order constitutive boundary conditions adopted in literature may be expressed as either of the following conditions [47]. The first constitutive boundary conditions, referred to as Kinematic Higher-Order Boundary Conditions (KHOBC), are expressed by the vanishing of the flexural curvature at the end cross-sections\n= == =v| | 0x L x x L0, 2 0, (13)\nThe second constitutive boundary conditions, referred to as Static Higher-Order Boundary Conditions (SHOBC), are expressed by the vanishing of the derivative of flexural curvature at the end cross-sections\n= == =v| | 0x x L x x L0, 3 0, (14)\nBernoulli-Euler nano-beam with four different sets of boundary conditions including doubly clamped, clamped-simply supported, simply supported and cantilever nano-beams under a uniform load q0 are examined.\nWhile the set of classical boundary conditions are enforced to the beam ends according to local Bernoulli-Euler beam theory, the constitutive boundary conditions are imposed to corresponding beam ends in the proposed nonlocal model as Eq. (8) yielding in the deflection v and the higher-order constitutive boundary conditions as Eqs. (13) and (14) are enforced for the counterpart models resulting in the deflections vKHOBC and vSHOBC, respectively. Also, the acronyms CC, CF, CS and SS stand for doubly clamped, clamped-free, clamped-simply supported and simply supported boundary conditions, respectively.

The maximum deflection of the nano-beam is also\nThe presented nonlocal models are furthermore considered to get the numerical assessment of flexural deflection of Bernoulli-Euler nanobeams. In order to examine the effects of the characteristic parameters λ and μ on structural response, numerical illustrations regarding a Bernoulli-Euler nano-beam are also elucidated and discussed for the aforementioned cases. Figs. 1–4 depict the plots of the non-dimensional\nmaximum deflection v̄maxassociated with the modified nonlocal strain gradient model and the counterpart nonlocal formulations of elasticity v̄maxCBS I, v̄maxSHOBC versus the non-dimensional characteristic parameter λ, for different values of non-dimensional characteristic parameter μ, while CC, CF, CS and SS boundary conditions are imposed, respectively. While the non-dimensional characteristic parameter λ is ranging in the interval ]0,0.1[, the non-dimensional characteristic parameter μ is assumed to range in the set +{0 , 0.04, 0.07, 0.1}. It is noticeably deduced from Figs. 1–4 that the modified nonlocal strain gradient model exhibits a softening behavior in terms of the non-dimensional characteristic parameter λ and a hardening behavior in terms of the non-dimensional characteristic parameter μ for different boundary conditions. The nondimensional maximum deflection associated with the counterpart nonlocal theory of elasticity v̄maxKHOBC, v̄maxSHOBC also exhibits a hardening behavior with respect to the non-dimensional characteristic parameter μ for different boundary conditions. However, non-dimensional maximum deflections v̄maxKHOBC, v̄maxSHOBC are independent of the non-dimensional characteristic parameter λ for doubly clamped nano-beams. While non-dimensional maximum deflections v̄maxKHOBC, v̄maxSHOBC of nanocantilevers are reducing with respect to the non-dimensional characteristic parameter λ for nano-cantilevers, non-dimensional maximum deflections are increasing with respect to the non-dimensional characteristic parameter λ for clamped-simply supported and simply supported nano-beams. In case of counterpart nonlocal theories of elasticity, the size-effect on the deflection v̄maxKHOBC associated with KHOBC is more noticeable in comparison to the deflection v̄maxSHOBC associated with SHOBC. While non-dimensional maximum deflection in accordance to the counterpart nonlocal theory of elasticity v̄maxKHOBC, v̄maxSHOBC exhibits a hardening or softening or independent behavior with respect to the non-dimensional characteristic parameter λ, the softening effect is more noticeable for simply supported nano-beams. The deflections of nano-beams according to the innovative nonlocal theory and the counterpart nonlocal theory employing SHOBC coincide when the nondimensional characteristic parameter approaches zero +0 , for all values of non-dimensional characteristic parameter μ. While all sizedependent theories coincide with the results of the local Bernoulli-Euler beam theory for vanishing non-dimensional characteristic parameters λ and +µ 0 , discrepancy between the flexural results of size-dependent models is enhanced by increasing values of the non-dimensional characteristic parameters. Finally, all of the size-dependent models reveal a hardening behavior in terms of the number of kinematic boundary constraints. The stiffest structural response with respect to the considered boundary conditions is revealed by doubly clamped BernoulliEuler nano-beams. Also, the numerical results of non-dimensional maximum deflection v µ¯ ( , )max evaluated by the modified nonlocal strain gradient model and the counterpart nonlocal theories of elasticity together with the ratios KHOBC and SHOBC between the gaps of v̄max of the modified nonlocal strain gradient model with respect to the counterpart nonlocal theories of elasticity v̄maxKHOBC, v̄maxSHOBC are reported in Tables 1–4 for CC, CF, CS and SS boundary conditions.\n5. Concluding remarks\nThe outcomes of the present paper may be summarized as follows.\n• Scale phenomena in functionally graded (FG) nano-beams have been modeled by the nonlocal strain gradient elasticity theory proposed in Ref. [46], equipped with the innovative natural constitutive boundary conditions (CBC) contributed in Ref. [49]. • The elastostatic problem of a nonlocal strain gradient inflected nano-beam has been formulated by considering both the CBC and the higher-order boundary conditions commonly adopted in literature. Analytical and numerical displacement solutions for doubly clamped, clamped-free, clamped-simply supported and simply supported nano-beams subject to a uniformly distributed transversal loading have been established and compared. New benchmarks for\nnumerical analyses have been also detected. • It has been underlined that the nonlocal strain gradient displace-\nment solutions exhibit softening and stiffening behaviors for increasing values of the nonlocal and strain gradient parameters respectively. The proposed model is therefore able to capture significantly size-dependent responses of FG nano-structures.\nAcknowledgment\nFinancial supports from the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) in the framework of the Project PRIN 2015 “COAN 5.50.16.01” - code 2015JW9NJT - and from the research program ReLUIS 2018 are gratefully acknowledged.\nAppendix A.

According to this model, the bending moment is expressed by integral convolutions of elastic flexural curvature and of its derivative with the special bi-exponential averaging kernel. It has been recently proven that such a relation is equivalent to a differential equation, involving bending moment and flexural curvature fields, equipped with natural higher-order boundary conditions of constitutive type. The associated elastostatic problem of a Bernoulli-Euler functionally graded nanobeam is formulated and solved for simple statical schemes of technical interest. An effective analytical approach is presented and exploited to establish exact expressions of nonlocal strain gradient transverse displacements of doubly clamped, cantilever, clampedsimply supported and simply supported nano-beams, detecting thus also new benchmarks for numerical analyses. Comparisons with results of literature, corresponding to selected higher-order boundary conditions are provided and discussed. The considered nonlocal strain gradient model can be advantageously adopted to characterize scale phenomena in nano-engineering problems.",
