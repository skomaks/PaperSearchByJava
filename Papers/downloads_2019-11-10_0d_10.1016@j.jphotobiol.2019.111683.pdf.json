The current investigation is focused on developing pegylated citric acid cefotaxime dendrimers through the divergent method and its characterization through spectroscopic, microscopic, thermal and microscopic techniques. Among the spectroscopic techniques, 1H NMR and 13C NMR elucidated the key functional groups at various chemical shifts while ESI-MS pointed out the molecular weight of cefotaxime sodium in various generations. Similarly, FTIR, DSC, and AFM investigations detailed that the generations are devoid of incompatibilities, structural deformities and can be opted for targeted drug delivery. The drug entrapment studies and in-vitro drug release studies highlight CFTX G5 containing 92.4% entrapment efficacy and 83.8% drug release in 48 h and specifies a sustain release characteristics. In connection to the above, the in-vivo studies reveal a potent antibacterial activity against various gram-positive and gramnegative microorganisms with a decreased hemolysis and cytotoxicity effects and reflect a high margin of safety regarding pegylated CFTX dendrimers. Further, the antibacterial activities are supported through confocal microscopy that clarified the cellular uptake of dendritic molecules and their internalization."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Dendrimers are hyperbranched macromolecular structures that emanate from core region and can be tailored enough for evincing distinct functionalities such as enhanced molecular size, optimized size distribution and structural characteristics [1]. The hyperbranched architectures were investigated by Vogtle in1978 [2,3], by D. Tomalia in the 1980s [4,5] and independently by Newkome [6]. The hyperbranched structures are also called arborols which means “trees” in Latin and cascade molecules but are not much familiar as dendrimers. Further, the advent of hyperbranched structures explored a massive advancement in synthetic chemistry and amplifies its significance towards inherent biomedical applications such as drug delivery, gene transfection, and imaging [7]. In connection to the dendrimer synthesis, they can be synthesized effectively through conventional methods such as convergent approach [8,9] or divergent approach and furthering through various advanced approaches [10,11]. The dendrimers are considered as the structural motif and exhibit modifications in its size, shape, flexibility, low polydispersity, and low transfection efficacy with\ngenerations. Further, the surface functionalities of hyperbranched structures are amended through its conjugation with diverse bioactive agents that engenders enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) and enhance drug targeting [12,13], imaging [14,15], diagnostic [16,17], and therapeutic properties [18,19]. This explicit property of dendrimers has fascinated the investigators to study their potentiality in targeted drug delivery systems. In the current investigation, we aimed at developing a dendritic formulation of cefotaxime sodium (CFTX), a semi-synthetic, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic indicated for the treatment of diverse bacterial infections. The pharmacokinetic parameters specify that intramuscular administration of CFTX exhibits half-life of 1 h, 30% of protein binding, maximum serum concentration of 11.7 μg/ml in 30min which potentially instigated the investigators to develop a suitable formulation that can decrease the cytotoxicity and enhance the pharmacokinetic parameters through effective targeting of bacterial cells alone without targeting the healthier cells. Hence, the demand to develop a novel drug delivery system that meets the biological stipulations and enhance the patient acceptability has potentially motivated us to develop the hyperbranched architectures containing\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2019.111683 Received 16 October 2019; Received in revised form 27 October 2019; Accepted 1 November 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author at: School of Advanced Sciences, Vellore Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, India.

Therefore, we aimed to develop dendritic formulations of cefotaxime sodium through the traditional divergent method of synthesis and draw the following conclusions: (1) the hyperbranched structures of higher generation exhibits superior drug encapsulation properties in comparison to the lower ones and generate sustain release characteristics. (2) Predict the drug delivery characteristics through effective host-guest interactions between drug molecules and terminal end surfaces of hyperbranched structures. Apart from the above, it is arduous to predict the allocation of drug molecules in the dendritic cavities and host-guest interactions at the terminal end. Hence, the objective of current exploration relates to overcoming the aforementioned strenuous situations by focusing on effective analytical techniques that manifests an appropriate explanation in generating an optimized formulation."

The mixture thus obtained is cooled to 4 to5°C and at room temperature, it is layered with diethyl ether which results in a biphasic solution containing aqueous and ether phases. The aqueous phase is segregated and subjected to mild heating that results in PEG diacid (Scheme 1) which is considered as the first-generation dendrimer. Further, the resultant was treated with specified quantities of thionyl chloride under magnetic stirring, condensed, incorporated with 20ml of DMF at 70 °C under magnetic stirring and cooled at 10–15 °C for 24 h.While in a separate roundbottomed flask 0.1M of citric acid is dissolved in 10ml of DMF which is in turn incorporated with 3M (125ml) of pyridine and maintained at\n10–15 °C for 24 h. Both the reaction mixtures are added one to another and incubated at 60 °C for 6 h for the production of a second-generation dendrimer (Scheme 2).

The half-life for CFTX pure dendrimers is pointed out at 30min whereas, for pegylated CFTX dendrimers, CFTX G5 discloses the maximum half-life at 51.38min because as the generation proceeds, the dendrimer allocates enough space for drug entrapment and enhances the MRT of the drug molecules. Simultaneously the experimental data related to AUC0→∞ for CFTX pure dendrimers is specified at 23.15 ± 1.2 whereas it specifies elevated values for CFTX G5 dendrimers at 32.64 ± 1.4 which is majorly due to decreased Ke values for the corresponding dendrimers and evinces an inverse proportionality with AUC. Apart from the above, the apparent clearance of the drug for CFTX pure dendrimers is pointed out at 0.125 and decreased for various generations which might be due to protein binding whereas the apparent clearance (Cl /F) reflects a maximum value for CFTX G2 dendrimers as 0.0654 which is principally due to prolonged half-life (t1/2), AUC and decreased elimination rate constant (ke) (Table 4).

    "abstractText" : "In recent years dendrimers have fascinated the investigators towards targeted drug delivery because of their versatile framework and exhibit immense potentiality in entrapping drug moieties through host-guest interactions and serve as a promising vector in biological applications. The current investigation is focused on developing pegylated citric acid cefotaxime dendrimers through the divergent method and its characterization through spectroscopic, microscopic, thermal and microscopic techniques. Among the spectroscopic techniques, 1H NMR and 13C NMR elucidated the key functional groups at various chemical shifts while ESI-MS pointed out the molecular weight of cefotaxime sodium in various generations. Similarly, FTIR, DSC, and AFM investigations detailed that the generations are devoid of incompatibilities, structural deformities and can be opted for targeted drug delivery. The drug entrapment studies and in-vitro drug release studies highlight CFTX G5 containing 92.4% entrapment efficacy and 83.8% drug release in 48 h and specifies a sustain release characteristics. In connection to the above, the in-vivo studies reveal a potent antibacterial activity against various gram-positive and gramnegative microorganisms with a decreased hemolysis and cytotoxicity effects and reflect a high margin of safety regarding pegylated CFTX dendrimers. Further, the antibacterial activities are supported through confocal microscopy that clarified the cellular uptake of dendritic molecules and their internalization.",
