The extraction capabilities of the new phases have been studied using several triazinic herbicides with log of octanol/water partition coefficients (K ow ) ranging from -0.7 to 3.21 under reversed phase chromatographic conditions. Best extraction efficiencies for the most polar compounds (log K ow ≤ 2.3) were typically obtained with the CuO NPs doped phase.

Introduction\nToday, cost-effective and sustainable analytical procedures are emanded in all fields of application. However, a lot of research is till needed to achieve this goal. In liquid chromatography (LC) a ossible option is to employ miniaturized scale separations such s capillary-LC or nano-LC [1] . The main advantages of miniaurized LC are the reduction of the consumption of both mobile nd stationary phases, and the improvement of the sensitivity deived from the fact that the dispersion of the analytes during the hromatographic separation is minimized. However, the amount of ample that can be processed in such systems is also low. Thus, he possibility of preconcentrating the analytes on-line is a key actor to make nano-LC a real option for many analytical pur-\n∗ Corresponding authors. E-mail addresses: rosa.herraez@uv.es (R.

In-tube solid-phase microextracion (IT-SPME) is a very attractive tool for the on-line isolation nd enrichment of organic compounds from aqueous matrices beause relatively large sample volumes can be processed without\nrior sample treatment [2] . Since its introduction in 1997 by Eisert nd Pawliszyn [3] , a lot of sorbents and configurations have been roposed [4–9] . However, up to now most of the applications of T-SPME deal with conventional and capillary-LC, as the coupling\nf IT-SPME to nano-LC has been introduced more recently [10 , 11] . ubstantial progress in the application of IT-SPME-nano-LC can be xpected through the development of new sorbents.\nDuring the past years different types of sorbents have been proosed for the extraction of a wide variety of compounds, including anostructured materials, molecularly imprinted polymers, mono-\niths, and many others [12–14] . Because of their inherent properies, nanostructured sorbents have been extensively used in solid-\nhase microextraction, mostly in fiber format. However, only a\new phases have been implemented in on-line IT-SPME systems\nw g f\np k ( t e b\n2\np e m w d d b h\na c g b 5 p 1 r\nH ( a p d t i c\nf\ng w a\n2\nt 1 T t N t a t 1 w r t 4\nm a\nso far. Examples of nanostructured phases developed for IT-SPME include coatings of TiO 2 deposited on the internal surface of silica capillaries [15] , and different polymers doped with silica NPs [16 , 17] , carbon nanotubes [18 , 19] or silver NPs [20 , 21] . In general terms, these sorbents provided suitable extraction rates for nonpolar compounds such as PAHs, phthalates or fatty acids. However, much poorer extraction efficiencies were obtained for more polar compounds such as phenols or polar pesticides. It can be concluded that the extraction of highly polar compounds by IT-SPME (as for many other extraction and microextraction techniques) is still a challenge.\nNew sorbents capable of interacting with highly polar analytes are needed. Ideally, such sorbents have to be compatible, not only with typical reversed-phase conditions, but also with chromatographic modes better suited for the separation of polar compounds, for example with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). Over the past years HILIC has attracted increasing attention as an alternative to reversed-phase liquid chromatography for the separation of polar and hydrophilic compounds [22–24] . However, to the best of our knowledge, no applications of IT-SPME combined on-line to nano-LC under HILIC conditions have been described.\nIn previous works our group demonstrated that the functionalization of a silica tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and triethoxymethylsilane (MTEOS) polymer with TiO 2 NPs is an excellent alternative for the extraction of some organophosphorous and methyl urea pesticides [25] . This is because the TEOS-MTEOS polymer retains organic compounds mainly by hydrophobic interactions, whereas the TiO 2 NPs establish additional interactions such as dipole-dipole or hydrogen bonding. In the present work, we have evaluated the responses of hybrid TEOS-MTEOS coatings reinforced with different kinds of metal and metal oxide NPs for the extraction of polar herbicides. The utility of these NPs when used as fiber coatings has been illustrated in several papers [26– 33] , but little work has been done in IT-SPME. The NPs tested in the present study were silver and gold NPs of different sizes and cappings, and a variety of metal oxide NPs, namely titania (TiO 2 ), zirconia (ZrO 2 ), alumina (Al 2 O 3 ), iron (III) oxide (Fe 2 O 3 ), zinc oxide (ZnO) and cupper (II) oxide (CuO); silica NPs were also included for comparison purposes. The capillaries have been tested for the extraction triazine-like herbicides of different polarities under reversed-phase conditions (see supplementary information, Table S1). On the basis of the results obtained, a new sorbent with CuO NPs is proposed for the extraction of highly polar compounds (log K ow as low as −0.7). The sorbent has been also tested for the extraction of the amino acids tryptophan (log K ow = −1.06) and tyrosine (log K ow = −2.26) under HILIC conditions. The utility of the proposed extractive phase under the two chromatographic modes is illustrated through its application to the analysis of different environmental and waste water samples.\n2. Experimental\n2.1. Reagents and solutions\nAll reagents were of analytical grade. Iodosulfuron-methylsodium, tribenuron-methyl, tritosulfuron, triflusulfuron-methyl, metribuzin, terbuthylazine, desethyl-terbuthylazine, irgarol, tyrosine, tryptophan, ovalbumin, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), triethoxymethylsilane (MTEOS), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), SiO 2 NPs (5–15 nm), TiO 2 NPs (21 nm), Al 2 O 3 NPs ( ≤ 50 nm), ZrO 2 NPs (20 nm), CuO NPs (40 nm), ZnO NPs (44 nm), Fe 2 O 3 NPs (35 nm) and sodium hydroxide were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Commercial suspensions of Au NPs (5, 20 and 40 nm) and Ag NPs (20 nm and 40 nm) both 0.02 mg/mL in sodium citrate, and Au NPs (5, 20 and 40 nm) in phosphate buffer\nere also supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Acetonitrile was of HPLC\nrade (MWR, Radnor, PA, USA). Ammonium acetate was obtained rom Scharlab (Barcelona, Spain).\nStock standard solutions of the herbicides (100 μg/mL) were repared by dilution of the pure compounds in acetonitrile, and ept at −20 °C until use. Standard solutions of the amino acids 200 μg/mL) and ovalbumin (5000 μg/mL) were prepared by diluion of the pure compounds in nanopure water, and kept at ambint temperature until use. Working solutions were prepared daily y dilution of the stock solutions with ultrapure water.\n.2. Apparatus and chromatographic conditions\nThe chromatographic analysis of the studied compounds was erformed using an Agilent 1260 Infinity nano-LC chromatograph quipped with a quaternary nano-pump, a six port micro-scale\nanual injector (Rheodyne), and a UV–Vis diode array detector ith a 80 nL nanoflow cell (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). The\netector was coupled to a data system (Agilent, ChemStation) for ata acquisition and treatment. The analytical signal was recorded etween 190 nm and 400 nm, and monitored at 230 nm for the erbicides and at 280 nm for the amino acids.\nA Zorbax 300SB C18 (50 mm x 75 μm i.d., 3.5 μm particle size) nalytical column (Agilent) was used for the analysis of the herbiides. The mobile phase was a mixture of water and acetonitrile in radient elution mode. The percentage of acetonitrile in the moile phase was linearly increased from 20% at 0 −1 min, to 70% at min, and then kept constant until 15 min; finally, the acetonitrile ercentage was linearly decreased to reach a percentage of 20% at 7 min, and maintained constant until the end of the run. The flow ate was 0.5 μL/min.\nThe separation of the amino acids was performed using a ZIC®ILIC (150 mm x 75 μm i.d., 5 μm particle size) analytical column MERK, Darmstadt, Germany); the mobile phase was a mixture of cetonitrile and ammonium acetate buffer (20 mM, pH 6.8). The ercentage of acetonitrile was 95% at 0 - 2.9 min, and then linearly ecreased to 80% at min 3, and then kept constant until the end of he run. The mobile phase flow rate was linearly changed from an nitial value of 0.5 μL/min to 0.7 μL/min at 11 min, and then kept onstant until the end of the run.\nAll solvents were filtered through 0.2 μm nylon membranes be-\nore use (Whatman, Maidstone, UK).\nFor the characterization of the synthetized coatings, microraphs of scanning electronic microscope (SEM) were obtained\nith a Hitachi-S 4800 equipment (Tokyo, Japan) which operated\nt 20 kV.\n.3. Preparation of the capillaries\nExtractive capillaries with different coatings were used hroughout the study. These capillaries were prepared from 5 cm-segments of fused silica tubes, 75 μm i.d. (Análisis Vínicos, omelloso, Spain). Before the coating process, the internal walls of he silica capillaries were activated by flushing through them 1 M aOH for 4 h at 40 °C, followed by 0.1 M HCl for 30 min at room emperature. Next, the capillaries were heated at 60 °C for 3 h, nd finally flushed with water and dried with air. For preparing he TEOS-MTEOS based capillaries 65 mg of PEG, 100 μL of TEOS, 00 μL MTEOS, 50 μL of water and 2 mL of 0.1 M NH 4 OH (catalyst)\nere mixed in a glass vial and vortexed for 1 min [11 , 34] . The esulting homogenous dispersion was immediately used to fulfill he preconditioned capillaries. Then, the capillaries were heated at 0 °C for 2 h and aged overnight (14 −15 h) at 120 °C. The same procedure was used for preparing the SiO 2 or the\netal oxide NPs functionalized capillaries, but the appropriate mount of NPs was incorporated to the TEOS/MTEOS/PEG/water/\nc t i T t s T s r c\ng a p\n2\nr v p p s w s\nt U l t a a s t\nc e N e i f v s p t\ns P i\n2\nC a k w m R\nu c w a w T o 1\natalyst mixture; unless otherwise stated, the amount of NPs in he resulting dispersions was 0.05 mg/mL. For the capillaries modfied with Au and Ag NPs, 100 μL of the mixture containing PEG,\nEOS, MTEOS, water and the catalyst were mixed with 100 μL of he Au or Ag NPs dispersions. The rest of the procedure was the ame used to synthetize the metal oxide NPs modified coatings. he naked Au NPs and Ag NPs stabilized in glycerol-water were ynthetized following the procedures described in [35] and [36] , espectively; for assays with the other Au NPs and Ag NPs, the ommercial suspensions were used.\nOnce prepared, the capillaries were installed into the chromatoraphic system and washed with acetonitrile for about 30 min at\nflow rate of 0.5 μL/min, and then conditioned with the mobile\nhase (20:80 acetonitrile:water) before being used.\n.4. IT-SPME conditions\nFor IT-SPME with a single capillary an in-valve IT-SPME configuation was used; for this purpose the loop of the six-port injection alve was substituted by the extractive capillary (see Fig. 1 A). Samles were manually loaded into the IT-SPME system using a 500 μL recision syringe. Then, the valve was changed to the injection poition, so that the analytes retained in the capillary were desorbed\nith the mobile-phase and transferred to the analytical column for\neparation and detection.\nIn assays with two extractive capillaries, an electronically conrolled 10-port switching valve (Valco Instruments, Houston, TX,\nSA) was used to connect the extractive capillaries to the injection oop during the extraction step, or to the analytical column during he desorption/separation/detection ( Fig. 1 ). Samples were manully loaded into a PEEK tube (internal volume, 500 μL) which acted s injection loop of the 6-port injection valve; by changing the poition of this valve, an aliquot of the sample was transferred from he injection loop to the two extractive capillaries by means of a\napillary pump (LC-20AD XR, Shimadzu, Kioto, Japan) which delivred water at a flow rate of 50 μL/min (unless otherwise stated). ext, the position of the 10-port valve was switched, so that the xtractive capillaries were inserted into the nano-LC flow scheme; n such a way, the analytes retained in the capillaries were transerred to the analytical column for separation and detection. The olume of the sample transferred to the extractive capillaries was et by controlling the time for changing the position of the 10-\nort valve. Times between 1 and 10 min were tested (equivalent o sample volumes of 50–500 μL).\nFor connecting the extractive capillaries to the valves, 2.5 cm leeve of 1/6 i.n. polyether ether ketone (PEEK) tubing, 1/6 i.n. EEK nuts and ferrules were used. All the assays were performed n triplicate at room temperature.\n.5. Analysis of real samples\nRiver and sea water samples collected at different points of the omunitat Valenciana region (East Spain) were tested for the trizine herbicides. After their arrival to the lab, the samples were ept in the dark at 4 °C until analysis. Portions of the samples ere filtered through 0.22 μm nylon membranes (Teknokroma) im-\nediately before being processed in the IT-SPME-nano-LC system.\neversed phase conditions were used in this study.\nWaste water samples collected from a dairy industry that had sed ovalbumin in the course of its production activities were proessed by IT-SPME-nano-LC under HILIC conditions. These samples\nere treated to hydrolyse ovalbumin in order to obtain the free\nmino acids. For this purpose 1 mL of the samples were treated ith 10 μL of NaOH 5 M; the mixture was heated at 95 °C for 8 h. hen, 400 μL of hydrolysed samples were neutralized with 20 μL f glacial acetic acid, and mixed with 580 μL of acetonitrile. Finally, 00 μL of the resulting mixture were filtered and processed.\nAll the assays were performed in triplicate.\nb c t t fi t c\nl g t p w t l V t g r c a s c w t t\n3\nt ( T\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Preparation of the capillaries\nFirst, the extractive capillaries were prepared with the different NPs tested. In the case of Au NPs and Ag NPs, suspensions of NPs of different size and capping were assayed. The synthetized sorbents were analysed by SEM. In all instances suitable porosity and homogeneity of the coatings were observed. As an illustrative example, in Fig. 2 is shown the coating obtained with TiO 2 NPs under different magnifications. According to the literature, under the conditions used for the synthesis, the TEOS-MTEOS polymeric network is covalently attached to the capillary surface [34 , 37 , 38] . This is consistent with the images of the coatings obtained after several uses of the capillary (see Fig. 2 C).\nIn principle, an increment in the number of available sites for interaction can be expected by increasing the amount of NPs in the coating. For this reason, different amounts of NPs were added to the dispersions used to prepare the coatings (see Section 2.3 ); the amounts assayed were in the 0.01 - 5.0 mg/mL range. However, preliminary experiments showed that for NPs contents higher than 0.05 mg/mL the peak areas obtained for the analytes decreased (data not shown). These observations suggested that a high content of NPs affected negatively the formation of the TEOS-MTEOS matrix, probably because the dispersion of the NPs was less effective [30] . Consequently, the amount of NPs selected in further experiments was 0.05 mg/mL.\n3.2. Extraction of triazine herbicides under reversed-phase conditions\nThe synthetized sorbents were first assayed for the triazinic herbicides under reversed phase elution conditions. Different\nlanks (ultrapure water) and solutions of the analytes were proessed. The chromatograms obtained for blanks with the different ypes of NPs (see Fig. 3 ) were quite similar, although more inense background peaks were observed with the Al 2 O 3 NPs modi-\ned coating. After washing the synthetized sorbents with acetoni-\nrile ( Section 2.3 ) the background signals remained approximately onstant.\nBackground peaks are mainly due to traces of substances reeased from the sorbents at the end of the gradient elution proram. Despite this, the capillaries showed good stability in terms of he extraction performance (as discussed below). Moreover, those\neaks did not interfere with the analysis of the target herbicides,\nhich could be properly identified through the joint evaluation of heir retention times and UV spectra, measured by injecting soutions of the individual compounds at different concentrations.\nariations in the retention times up to 2.3 min were observed in\nhe course of our study. In a previous work on the analysis of oranic pollutants by IT-SPME coupled to capillary LC shifts in the etention times up to 2.4 min were found when using analytical olumns of different batches (working also under gradient elution nd at ambient temperature) [39] . Therefore, the variations oberved with the IT-SPME - nano-LC system were considered aceptable taking into account that different capillaries and columns\nere used throughout the study. In order to avoid misidentificaion, the retention times were checked every time that the extracive capillary and/or the analytical column were changed.\n.2.1. Effect of the type of NPs on the extraction efficiency\nIn order to evaluate and compare the effect of the different ypes of NPs on the extraction efficiencies, the enrichment ratios ERs) were established for each analyte in the different capillaries. hese values were calculated as the quotient between the mean\na s t t 2\nl i m E N t h N t t\nw o t f w u\nl t t w a a N t C\nreas obtained with the NPs reinforced coatings and those meaured with the unmodified TEOS-MTEOS coating for solutions conaining the same concentration of the analytes. In this study, soluions of the target compounds at concentrations ranging from 5 to 5 μg/L were used.\nWhen using capillaries coated with Au NPs and Ag NPs ow peak areas were observed for the most polar analytes odosulfuron-methyl-sodium, tritosulfuron, tribenuron-methyl and\netribuzin, regardless the NPs characteristics; as a result most\nRs were < 1 (Table S2). This indicates that the presence of Ps affected negatively the extraction. In contrast, for desethylerbuthylazine, triflusulfuron-methyl, terbuthylazine and irgarol igher peak areas were registered (ER > 1), which means that the\nPs had a positive effect on the extraction. The highest ERs with\nhe Au NPs were obtained for the coatings synthetized with soluions of NPs of 20 nm in citrate buffer. For the Ag NPs best results\nere obtained with NPs of 40 nm, also in citrate buffer. The ERs\nbtained with these coatings are listed in Table 1 . As an illustraive example, in Fig. 4 A are depicted the chromatograms obtained or a solution of some of the analytes with these two coatings, as\nell as the chromatogram obtained for the same solution with the nmodified TEOS-MTEOS phase.\nIn Table 1 are also listed the ERs obtained with the capilaries doped with the SiO 2 and metal oxide NPs. In general, litle improvement was observed for all the analytes assayed with he Al 2 O 3 , ZrO 2 and ZnO NPs modified coatings (ERs ≤ 1.8), hereas the presence of SiO 2 NPs and Fe 2 O 3 NPs had moderte effect on the extraction efficiencies for most compounds. For ll the analytes, the highest ERs were obtained with the CuO\nPs or with the TiO 2 NPs modified coatings. However, these\nwo sorbents exhibited different selectivity. In the presence of uO NPs the highest ERs values were found for the most polar\na M t t i T i g c o c t s t r\nt a a T l v e\ns i S I w ( w a 2 o\nherbicides iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, tritosulfuron, metribuzin and desethyl-terbuthylazine (with the exception of tribenuronmethyl), whereas TiO 2 NPs modified coatings gave the highest ERs for the less polar compounds triflusulfuron-methyl, terbuthylazine and irgarol. In other words, both types of NPs increased the efficiency of the extraction but CuO NPs were more effective for retaining the most polar analytes, whereas TiO 2 NPs were superior for extracting the less polar triazines.\nIt has to be remarked that with most of the capillaries significant differences on the ERs were obtained for triflusulfuronmethyl, terbuthylazine and irgarol, despite the fact that the three compounds have similar octanol/water partition coefficients (see Table S1). This means that the NPs modify the selectivity with respect the TEOS-MTEOS coating. Hydrophobic interactions are predominant with the unmodified polymer. The presence of silica and metal oxide NPs in the coatings increases the active sites for interaction because they have -OH groups on their surface. All the herbicides tested in the present study have groups (-NH-, -COO-, halogen atoms) that can interact with the –OH groups of the NPs by hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole, ion-dipole and van-der-Waals forces (see Table S1). Therefore, the extraction rates are dependent not only on the polarity of the analytes, but also on their chemical structure. Additionally, metal oxides NPs have acid Lewis sites that enable the retention of compounds with electron donor groups. The acidity of the metal oxide is expected to affect the efficiency of the extraction. Among the NPs tested, TiO 2 was the metal oxide with highest acidity [40] , which is in agreement with the high ERs obtained with these NPs. However, other aspects such as the NPs size and surface charge can also influence the efficiency, as deduced from Table 1 .\n3.2.2. Extraction with two types of NPs\nIn view of the results of Table 1 , capillaries doped with both TiO NPs and CuO NPs were prepared. For this purpose the same\n2\nmounts of CuO NPs and TiO 2 NPs were added to the TEOS-\nTEOS mixture used for preparation of the coatings, being the otal amount of NPs 0.05 mg/mL. The SEM images showed that his coating had also high porosity and homogeneity, as shown n Fig. 2 D. The peak shapes observed for the analytes with the\niO 2 –CuO NPs sorbent were similar to those obtained with cap-\nllaries modified with a single type of NPs (see Fig. 4 B); the backround chromatograms were also similar to those obtained with oatings doped with CuO NPs or with TiO 2 NPs ( Fig. 3 ). The ERs\nbtained with the TiO 2 –CuO NPs capillary are listed in Table 1 . It an be seen that the efficiency of the coating was similar to that of he TiO 2 NPs doped coating for most compounds, although a coniderable increment on the extraction efficiency was observed for riflusulfuron-methyl and terbuthylazine, with ERs of 8.14 and 17.5, espectively.\nThe possibility of increasing analyte detectability by coupling wo extractive capillaries each with a different type of NPs was lso evaluated. For this purpose, the samples were loaded first in\ncapillary doped with CuO NPs and then in a capillary containing\niO 2 NPs. The two capillaries were inserted between the injection\noop and the analytical column by means of a 10-port switching alve, as depicted in Fig. 1 . The effects of different variables on the xtraction efficiency were studied.\nFirst, samples volumes ranging from 50 μL to 500 μL were asayed by changing the time of connection between the loop of the njection valve (V1) and the 10-port switching valve (V2) of the ITPME device (see Fig. 1 C); the sampling flow rate was 50 μL/min. n Fig. 5 A are depicted the results obtained for three herbicides\nith different polarities, tritosulfuron (log K o/ w = 0.62), metribuzin low K o/ w = 1.7) and triflusulfuron-methyl (low K o/ w = 3.10), which ere selected as model compounds. It was observed that the anlyte responses increased by increasing the sample volume up to 00 μL (which corresponded to a transfer time between V1 and V2 f 4 min). Fig. 5 B shows that similar signals were obtained when\n2 ( s c s e r 5 t\na d s n E t o c h c b\n3\na M h\nl i I i l s o e c f o p r t c a 1 [\no t e o f fi [ w\n00 μL of the samples were delivered at a flow rate of 25 μL/min transfer time of 8 min), which indicates that the effect of the ampling flow rate was negligible. Finally, the order in which the apillaries were placed in the IT-SPME device was changed, but no ignificant differences on analyte peak areas were found, within xperimental variations (see also Fig. 5 B). According to these esults, delivering a sample volume of 200 μL at a flow rate of 0 μL/min was the option selected; the samples were first loaded hrough the capillary doped with CuO NPs, as depicted in Fig. 1 C.\nUnder the selected conditions the peaks obtained for the nalytes were more intense than those observed with the inividual capillaries, except for metribuzin. As listed in Table 1 , ignificant increments on the analytical signals with respect to a on-functionalized TEOS-MTEOS coated capillary were found, with Rs ranging from 2.02 to 30. The peak shapes were also satisfacory. This is shown in Fig. 4 B which compares the chromatograms btained with the three approaches tested for a working solution ontaining tritosulfuron, metribuzin and triflusulfuron-methyl. It as to be remarked that the insertion of an additional extractive apillary in the nano-LC flow scheme did not cause extra band roadening.\n.2.3. Analytical performance\nAccording to the results of the above section, a system with single extractive capillary coated with CuO NPs modified TEOSTEOS is recommended for the analysis of highly polar triazinic\nerbicides (log K ow ≤ 2.3). If compounds with a wider range of po-\narities are going to be analysed, the serial coupling of two capillares reinforced with CuO NPs and TiO 2 NPs is the option of choice. n Table 2 are summarized the limits of detection (LODs) and limts of quantification (LOQs) reached with both approaches, estabished as the concentrations of the analytes required to generate a ignal-to-noise ratio of 3 and 10, respectively. These values were\nbtained by injecting solutions with decreasing concentrations of ach compound; before analysing each solution, water was proessed to confirm the absence of contaminants and/or memory efects. As observed, the synthetized sorbents allowed the detection f most analytes at sub ppb levels. The LODs and LOQs make the\nroposed method suitable for monitoring these pesticides in envionmental waters. For example, the European authorities have esablished an environmental quality standard for the triazinic herbiide atrazine in surface waters of 2.0 μg/L (expressed as maximum llowable concentration) [41] , whereas Spain has set a limit of\nμg/L for terbuthylazine in surface waters (annual average value)\n42] .\nIn Table 3 are shown some relevant features of recent methds proposed for triazines that involve different forms of extracion before LC or gas chromatography (GC). Off-line solid phase xtraction (SPE) is the technique most widely used for the analysis f these compounds [43–47] , although on-line SPE [48] and other orms of extraction such solid phase microextraction (SPME) with\nbers [49] and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME)\n50] have also been proposed. Originally, octadecylsilane phases\nere used for extraction, but because of the high polarity of the\na r b a t r S d s p t t s\nc i r a\nw t t w\nt u r s i ( c\n3\na w m t m s fi w\nw l t f\nnalytes, alternative sorbents such as mixed mode anion exchange esins [43] , magnetic sorbents [44] and monoliths [49] have also een explored. In many of those methods the LODs reported are bout 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than those reached with the wo coupled capillaries system, but they involve a solvent evapoation step in order to preconcentrate the extracts collected after PE. Only in a few protocols the extracts collected after SPE were irectly processed in the chromatograph, being the LODs reported imilar to those achieved with the proposed IT-SPME-nano-LC aproach [45 , 50] . As it can be deduced from Table 3 , the main advanage of the proposed method is that the sample treatment is drasically simplified; as a consequence, the time of analysis is much horter and the amount of wastes generated is lower.\nThe extraction efficiencies obtained with the two serial coupled apillaries system ranged from 2 to 23% (Table S4), resulting in ncrements on the signal with respect to the untreated solutions anging from 7 to 75 (values obtained for iodo-sulfuron-methyl nd for irgarol, respectively).\nThe precision (expressed as relative standard deviation, RSD) as calculated from the consecutive injection of three aliquots of he working solutions in the same CuO NPs doped capillary or in he same CuO NPs and TiO 2 NPs doped capillaries, for the system\nith one or two capillaries, respectively. As observed in Table 2 ,\nhe RSDs were ≤ 10%, which can be considered satisfactory vales at the working concentration levels. On the other hand, the eproducibility within capillaries was measured by processing the ame solution of the analytes with three different capillaries modfied with TiO 2 or with CuO NPs; the RDSs ranged from 3% to 14% n = 3) (Table S3), which demonstrated that the synthesis of the apillaries was reproducible.\n.2.4. Application to environmental water samples\nFinally, different environmental waters were processed. Since ll the triazines were included in these experiments, the IT-SPME\nith two serial-coupled capillaries system was used. The chroatograms obtained for a non-positive sample and the sample forified with some of the analytes are depicted in Fig. 6 . The chro-\natograms obtained were similar to those observed for standard olutions. The peak areas measured for the analytes in the fortied samples were also similar. Relative recoveries obtained for sea\nater ranged from 80 to 107%, as it can be seen in Table 2 .\nIn Fig. 7 are depicted the chromatograms obtained for a river ater sample and a sea water sample both positive for terbuthyazine; the concentration estimated for the analytes in the sea waer was close to its LOD (0.02 μg/L), whereas the concentration ound in the river water sample was close the LOQ (0.075 μg/L).\n3\ni e T s 1 a s c\nn t w t l o t r c a\nDespite of the small concentrations of the analyte in the samples, its identification was possible through the joint consideration of the retention times and normalized spectra, and confirmed by spiking the sample with different amounts of the herbicide (see Fig. 7 ). It has to be remarked that in the course of our experiments we used the same capillaries for more than one hundred samples (previously filtered to prevent clogging) without observing variations in the system performance.\n3.3. Application to the analysis of amino acids by nano-HILIC\nBecause most amino acids are highly polar, their analysis by reversed phase LC typically involves a previous derivatization or ion-pair formation to increase the sensitivity and/or to improve the separation [51–53] . HILIC has been recently proposed as an alternative to simplify the chromatographic analysis of these compounds [54–56] . In this work, we have selected the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan (as they present significant UV absorbance) to check the potential utility of IT-SPME coupled to nano-HILIC. Since both compounds are highly polar, IT-SPME was carried out with a single capillary coated with CuO NPs.\n3.3.1. Optimization of the extraction and chromatographic conditions\nDifferent elution conditions were assayed in preliminary experiments; best chromatographic responses were obtained with the conditions described in Section 2.2 . For a further improvement of the peak profiles, the time interval in which the extractive capillary was inserted into the mobile phase flow stream (transfer time) was also optimized. The optimum transfer time was 2 min. For longer times, the peak shapes were unsuitable whereas the sensitivity decreased for shorter times.\nFinally, the sample volume was optimized by processing different volumes of a standard solution containing 0.5 μg/mL of tryptophan and 1.0 μg/mL of tyrosine. As it can be observed in Fig. 8 , the highest analyte responses were obtained for a sample volume of 100 μL. It has to be remarked that the inner volume of an uncoated extractive capillary was about 0.6 μL; thus, the results of Fig. 8 prove that the CuO NPs - TEOS-MTEOS phase is very effective in retaining the analytes. Fig. 9 A shows the chromatogram obtained under the selected conditions for a standard solution of the two amino acids assayed.\n.3.2. Application to waste water samples\nRelevant analytical parameters were determined by processng standard solutions of tryptophan and tyrosine. The calibration quations, linear working ranges, LODs and LOQs are shown in able 4 . The results indicated that the analytical performance was atisfactory within the concentration intervals 0.3 - 5 μg/mL and\n- 7 μg/mL for tryptophan and tyrosine, respectively; the precision chieved was also adequate. It was concluded that the method was uitable for the quantification of both amino acids at low μg/mL oncentration levels.\nTo illustrate the potential utility of the proposed IT-SPME - ano-HILIC system, tryptophan and tyrosin were used to estimate he concentration of residues of ovalbumin in industrial waste\naters. These two amino acids can be used to estimate the toal amount of protein if the working wavelength is properly seected. For example, at 280 nm the absorbance of a solution of valbumin is the same than the absorbance of a solution conaining stoichiometric equivalent amounts of tryptophan and tyosine (see Figure S1). Therefore, the concentration of ovalbumin an be established from the concentrations of the two amino acids fter the hydrolisation of the protein. For the hydrolysis of the\ns ( f a t c l e i o i\np t t p T e\ni i t w t w t t\n4\no e r o t p\namples a thermal treatment under alkaline condition was applied see Section 2.5 ). The hydrolysis degree was previously established rom a standard solution of ovalbumin. For this purpose the peak reas obtained for tryptophan and tyrosine were interpolated into he calibration equations of Table 4 in order to calculate their conentration in the hydrolysate. The hydrolysis degree was calcuated by comparing these concentrations with the concentration xpected taking into account the number of amino acid molecules n ovalbumin molecule and the dilution factors. The mean value\nbtained was 60%, which is comparable to other values reported\nn the literature with similar hydrolysis protocols [57] .\nIn Fig. 9 A are shown the chromatograms obtained for a samle before and after the hydrolysis treatment. The presence of the wo amino acids in the sample was established from their the reention times and UV spectra, and confirmed by spiking the samles with the analytes before the hydrolysis (see also Fig. 9 A). he concentration of ovalbumin was calculated from the peak aras of the free amino acids in the hydrolysed samples, and tak-\nng into account the stoichiometric ratio of amino acid molecules n the ovalbumin molecule. The calculated ovalbumin concentraion using tryptophan and tyrosine in the chromatogram of Fig. 9 A\nere 457 μg/mL and 435 μg/mL, respectively, which were consisent values. The mean concentration of ovalbumin in the sample\nas (446 ± 16) μg/mL. In principle, this method could be applied o any other protein after the appropriate treatment to release the arget amino acids.\n. Conclusions\nIn the present work we have studied the effect of modifying an rganic silica polymer with different kinds of NPs on the extraction fficiency of polar herbicides by on-line IT-SPME-nano-LC under eversed phase conditions. The extraction efficiency is the result f the type and the amount of NPs, and the chemical structure of he target compounds. Highest extraction efficiencies for the most olar herbicides were obtained with CuO NPs. Therefore, this is the\nextractive phase recommended if only highly polar compounds are going to be analysed. The serial coupling of two capillaries with CuO NPs and TiO 2 NPs, respectively, is the option recommended for the analysis of compounds with a wide range of polarities. The later approach provided increments on analyte peak areas up to 30 times with respect to those measured with the unmodified TEOSMTEOS coatings, allowing the detection of most herbicides at sub μg/L concentration levels.\nIn addition, the phase developed is compatible with HILIC, which is increasingly used in the separation of highly polar compounds. This has been illustrated using the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan as model compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that IT-SPME has been combined on-line to a nano-LC system that operates in HILIC mode.\nThe proposed approach has been successfully applied to environmental and wastewater samples, being the filtration of the sample the only treatment required. The bimodal extractive phase can be considered a versatile and sustainable tool for IT-SPME coupled on-line to nano-LC, as it minimizes off-line sample pretreatment, and reduces the analysis time and the generation of wastes (see Table 3 ), while providing high sensitivity and precision [58 , 59] .\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nP.

    "abstractText" : "Polymers obtained from tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and triethoxymethylsilane (MTEOS) have been functionalized with different metal and metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs), and used as coatings of extractive capillaries for the extraction of polar compounds by in-tube solid-phase microextraction (IT-SPME) coupled on-line to nano-liquid chromatography (nano-LC). The extraction capabilities of the new phases have been studied using several triazinic herbicides with log of octanol/water partition coefficients (K ow ) ranging from -0.7 to 3.21 under reversed phase chromatographic conditions. Best extraction efficiencies for the most polar compounds (log K ow ≤ 2.3) were typically obtained with the CuO NPs doped phase. The TEOS-MTEOS polymer can be modified with two types of NPs in order to obtain extractive phases capable of interacting with compounds of a wide range of polarities; alternatively, two capillaries each with a different type of NPs can be combined in series with the same goal. Under the later approach the limits of detection (LODs) found for the tested herbicides were 0.02–1.5 μg/L, and the precision expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD) varied from 2 to 10% ( n = 3). The recoveries found in sea water samples ranged from 80 to 107%. In addition, the developed CuO NPs doped phase can be used in hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), which is the separation mode recommended for highly polar compounds. This has been illustrated using the amino acids tyrosine (log K ow = -2.26) and tryptophan (log K ow = -1.06) as model compounds, being their respective LOD 0.1 and 0.3 μg/mL. Examples of application of the developed bimodal extractive phase to different environmental and waste waters are given in order to show its utility and versatility. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
