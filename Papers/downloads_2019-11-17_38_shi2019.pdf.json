      "text" : "The demand for potential drinking water is rising as the world’s population keeps growing [1]. Meanwhile, the use of chemicals, pharmaceutics, and industrial compounds has significant negative impacts by introducing a range of pollutants to water supply resources [2]. Therefore, on the one hand, clean water shortage pose a fundamental threat to the livelihood of people around the universe. On the other hand, conventional methods of using water supplies for irrigation in agriculture have turned into a source of environmental concern [1,3,4]. The detection of pharmaceutics and their degradation products in both surface- water and ground-water have been confirmed throughout the\nuniverse [5,6]. The leading sources of the dissipation of pharmaceutics to the aquatic environment are considered to be via several routes including pharmaceutic manufactures, hospitals and infirmaries, [7]. Recently, the releasing of drugs in the environment has been a matter of concern because it can lead to cancer, genetic mutation and destruction of environmental resources via the evolution of resistant bacteria in the environment, [8,9]. A few studies have addressed the possible and potential effects on aquatic organisms and human health, however the potential risks of being persistently exposed to combination of these material as well as their harmful residuals have yet remained unanswered [10]. Accordingly, the elimination of pharmaceutic residuals has been a subject receiving close review [11–13].

It has been reported that carbon-based material adsorption among other investigated methods presented the most potential as a sustainable and efficient treatment technique [15–18]. Generally, by having in mind the electrostatic, hydrophobic interactions between the target material and the adsorbent which can make the contaminant stick to the external surface of adsorbent, the whole adsorption process can be describable [19]. Proper elimination efficiency at diverse range of pollutants, the feasibility of regeneration, applicability to both sequential and batch functions as well as reliable and uncomplicated operational processes are among the numerous advantages of the adsorption process. Further advantages include insensitivity of the process to noxious contaminant, the absence of detrimental by-products and inexpensive equipment and accoutrements [20,21]. On the other hand, several disadvantages like high production and regeneration costs [16] and the frequency of AC regeneration that can expose performance to risk [22,23] is reported for the adsorption process. There are several types of Different carbonbased materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [24,25] and graphitic carbon nitride [26], etc, [27–32] which are employed for the elimination of pharmaceutics from different water sources.\nCeftriaxone sodium (CS) (Fig. 1), as one of the most repeatedly used antibiotics, has been extensively applied in human remedy and animal husbandry due to its wide-spectrum antimicrobial potency, which lead to increment of residues into wastewater, thereby causing ecological, environmental, and health issues; threatening biota; and disrupting innate microbial populations [33–36].\nRecently, an increase in the application of ultrasound irradiation as a stimulant agent in elimination process to aid mass transfer is observed. Also, it aids acoustical cavitation that emerged from formation, growth, and collapse of bubbles. Additionally, the initiation of final acoustical phenomenon instigated by ultrasonic irritation develops microscopic perturbation [37]. Conventional “one at a time” is based on the fact that diverse operating factors are independent of one another and the response at each step is proportional to one single parameter [38]. The conventional approach for optimization of process parameters requires large number of experiments, which may be quite expensive and time consuming [39]. These limitations can be resolved by experimental and multivariable optimization. Response surface methodology (RSM) has unique ability to model the relationships between several explanatory variables and one or more responses [50] via fewer experiments, shorter cycles and higher accuracy [40]. Application of RSM especially central composite design (CCD) supply knowledge about interaction and individual influence of input variables and their main effect over short time and simultaneously decrease experimental error [41,42].\nRSM method is concocted of the process designing step which is followed by calculating the optimal condition. Subsequently through this calculation, first or second order multinomial equation is constructed for better prediction of the real behavior in the study system with variable factors, ensuing ANOVA. In a tridimensional graph, the authenticated design can be displayed which can provide surface response of use for determining the optimum parameters for removal or\nsorption functions [37–42]. Present research main and interaction effect of most variables even in system with large number of factor, which efficiently can be possible by experimental design as powerful tools for optimization. In this work, response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite design were applied to investigate the optimal conditions for CS adsorption onto g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 with aid of sonication. The optimization of ultrasound assisted CS adsorption were performed by varying four independent factors (pH, CS concentration, adsorbent dosage and sonication time) to predict the response (removal percentage).\nThe goals of the current investigation are preparation of Bi2WO6 and loading them on g-C3N4/MWCNT to provide new HNC (g-C3N4/ MWCNT/Bi2WO6) and its characterization by XRD, FE-SEM, XPS, EDS, HRTEM and FT-IR its following inspection for adsorption potential of gC3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 for CS while correlation amongst responses to under study variables was inspected using CCD. To survey the mechanism of the ultrasound-assisted-removal of CS, in the ensuing, the analysis of the kinetic and isotherm data for the current system under optimum conditions was performed based on different designs."

First one is Plackett–Burman design (PBD) to assess the significance of the experimental factors pH (A), concentration of CS (B), adsorbent mass (C) and ultrasonic time (D), affecting ultrasound assisted removal. Second one is Central composite design (CCD) to optimize those factors identified as significant in the first step. The screening study using PBD and the optimization with CCD involved 30 experiments. In CCD, these 30\nexperiments included four replicate experiments in the central point for the estimation of experimental variance. In both studies, the experiments were randomly performed in order to minimize the effect of uncontrolled variables. The PBD method allows evaluation of N variables in N−1 tests. Each parameter was evaluated in three levels. −1 for a low level and +1 for a high level and 0 for a central points to estimate the experimental error (pure error) and the four factors were examined in some experimental trials. In the next step, medium formulation was selected to determine the optimum levels of significant variables for the ultrasound assisted removal procedure. For this purpose, the response surface methodology (RSM), using a CCD, was adopted for the augmentation of total CS removal. The variables were assessed at five coded levels (−α, −1, 0, +1, and +α), as is shown in Table 1.

      "text" : "The characterization of functional groups of as-prepared compound was performed using infrared spectroscopy that shown in Fig. 2a. The FT-IR analysis of g-C3N4/MWCNT demonstrates the signal bond at 890 cm−1 that can be assigned to the symmetric stretching mode of striazine moieties. Also, some peaks have appeared at the range of 1200–1800 cm−1 are related to the stretching vibration mode of C-N\nand C=N bonds [59]. Moreover, the broad peak at 3000–3250 cm−1 region can be attributed to the typical stretching vibration of carbon – nitrogen single bond [60]. IR-active signals at 1716, 1568, 1225 and 2900–3200 cm−1 were corresponded to the COOH moieties, G-band and D-band CHx groups of MWCNT respectively [61]. The FT-IR analysis of the pure Bi2WO6 presents some intensive sharp signals at 818 cm−1 and 709 cm−1, which can be assigned to the stretching mode of Bi]O and W]O bonds, respectively [62,63]. It could be seen with clarity that the fundamental signals of g-C3N4/MWCNT and Bi2WO6 all presented in the FT-IR spectra of g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 adsorbent, which authenticated the structure of adsorbent.\nFig. 2b showed the XRD spectra of Bi2WO6, g-C3N4/MWCNT and gC3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6. The XRD signals demonstrate the orthorhombic phase of the Bi2WO6 (Fig. S1. JCPDS No. 39–0256) [63,64]. XRD pattern of g-C3N4/MWCNT and g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 revealed a strong diffraction signal at 27.4° and a broad characteristic signal at 13.1°, that attributed to the (0 0 2) interlayer diffraction of g-C3N4 [65] and the in-planar structural packing motif of tri-s-triazine moieties (JCPDS 87-1526) [66]. A typical diffraction peak at 26.0° demonstrating the graphite-like sp2 structure of MWCNT. Two characteristic peaks for g-C3N4 and MWCNT were distinctly seen in the g-C3N4/ MWCNT and g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 compounds.\nOnly Bi2WO6 diffraction peaks were found for the g-C3N4/MWCNT/ Bi2WO6 (x=45%, 55%), that was mainly because the g-C3N4 was too narrow or the characteristic signals of Bi2WO6 (28.2°) and g-C3N4 (27.4°) were too close to recognize. However, weak diffraction peaks of g-C3N4 (27.4°) were found in g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 (5%-35%) adsorbent, respectively, which can be deduce which the g-C3N4/MWCNT/ Bi2WO6 adsorbents possess two phases.\nThe typical survey scan XPS spectrum of the g-C3N4/MWCNT/ Bi2WO6 (x= 45%) adsorbent demonstrated that Bi, W, O, C and N elements in the compound (Fig. 2c), the high-resolution spectrum for the C 1 s with the signals appeared at 285.9 and 284.9 eV attributing to the C-NH2 moieties and sp2 CeC bonds on the g-C3N4 [64,67] in Fig. S2a. As Fig. S2b exhibits the N 1s signals located at 399.4 and 398.8 eV, indicating the N atoms in the aromatic rings (CeN]C) and tertiary nitrogen in the g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 (x= 45%) adsorbents, which confirms the presented data in the literature [68]. As observed in Fig S2c, the binding energy of Bi 4f5/2 (164.7 eV) and Bi 4f7/2 (159.7 eV) could be attributed to Bi3+. Besides, two peaks in the W 4f spectrum of Fig. S2d located at 37.0 and 34.9 eV could be referred to W 4f 5/2 and W 4f 7/2, respectively [63,69]. In the O 1s spectrum of Fig. S2e, wide asymmetric peaks could be fitted into three peaks, including C]O (532.4 eV), W-O (530.9 eV) and Bi-O (529.6 eV) [70]. The results of XPS analysis reveal the co-existence of BW and g-C3N4 in the g-C3N4/ MWCNT/Bi2WO6 (x= 45%) composite.\nThe EDS pattern (Fig. 2d) of g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 (x= 45%) showed the presence of bismuth, tungsten, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen elements in the samples. An elemental analyzer was applied for estimating the content of g-C3N4, MWCNT and Bi2WO6 in g-C3N4/ MWCNT/Bi2WO6 adsorbent and the results were presented in Fig. 2d inset. The wet percentage of bismuth, tungsten, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen elements were 18.57, 8.02, 3.41, 27.12 and 42.88%, respectively, which reveals that the weight ratio of Bi2WO6 and g-C3N4/ MWCNT was 4.49:10, the results also confirmed the g-C3N4/MWCNT/ Bi2WO6 (x=45%).\nFE-SEM and TEM analysis were used for morphological investigation of the fabricated compounds. The microscopic image of g-C3N4 shows the 2D layered microstructure which could be exfoliated to gC3N4, and the g-C3N4 demonstrates the large specific surface areas, which revealed high efficiency in loading nanocrystals (Fig. 3a). The pure Bi2WO6 3D-cubic structure composed of many well-ordered nanosheets (Fig. 3c). However, the g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 (45%) showed the agglomeration structures which was different from pure Bi2WO6 and g-C3N4/MWCNT. With the Bi2WO6 content increased, the nanocubics were agglomeration, the g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 (55%) displayed the bulk structure. The typical TEM images was perused to\nbetter understand the structure of the synthesized compounds. The gC3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 (45%) revealed the nanosheet structure of gC3N4 that clearly contained the MWCNT and Bi2WO6 in Fig. 4a. The lattice fringes were of 0.315 nm correspond to the (1 1 3) crystal planes of Bi2WO6 in Fig. 4b. (JCPDS card No. 39-0256) [63]. The microstructure of g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 (45%) adsorbent also confirmed by HRTEM in Fig. 4c and d. By carefully determining the lattice factors and comparing with the informations in JCPDS (card No. 39–0256), two different types of lattice fringes with d-spacing of 0.315 nm and 0.272 nm were clearly detected in Fig. 4c and d, which was attributed to the (1 1 3) and (2 0 0) planes of orthorhombic phase of Bi2WO6 [63,69]. The results indicated that the heterojunction structure indeed organized from Bi2WO6 and g-C3N4/MWCNT."

In this statistical method, pvalue < 0.05 indicated strong evidence for statistical significance of variables at a 95% confidence level. Based on the Table 2, for adsorption of CS by g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 (x) adsorbents the linear term of the four mentioned variables, and the quadratic term of all parameters are considered statistically significant (p-value < 0.05).

The “Lack of Fit F-value” was estimated 0.097 for designing adsorption of CS that corroborates its non-statistical significance compared to pure error. The lower values of design errors along with correlation coefficient of 0.9981 signify proper application of CS adsorption data from aqueous media. Also, the established design could properly explain the figure 99.81% of the variability while just negligible of the total variation remained undefined. Additionally, the\nvalidity of the design is further confirmed by first low values of errors, second by the high value of correlation coefficients and third by notstatistical importance “Lack of Fit F-value”. Moreover, in Fig. 5 the predicted percentage of CS adsorption is juxtaposed against the experimental percentage of CS adsorption. In that, a mass nearby the diagonal line is shown, and the concurrence of the design is confirmed. Also, adjusted R2 of 0.9952 shows an agreeable value for design validation. Based on Table 2, a reasonable agreement is revealed by juxtaposing and comparing the predicted-R2 with adjusted-R2. Also the coefficient of variation (C.V.%) is less than ten which in comparison with the reasonable precision, accord with S/N ratio term that in the current study is 168.57, shows a greater value than the critical level of indicating the design desirability and ability. For exposing systematic variance from the presumption of normal distribution and errors independency from each other, the normal probability plot of raw remains (Fig. 6) is considered the best diagnostic instrument. Based on Fig. 6, the variances from the straight line is commensurate to nonnormality. These features and benefits provide a base for the explanation of why residuals have a normal distribution and why this behavior corroborates the ability and applicability of proffered design for interpretation of the responses. The significant contribution of variables on the CS adsorption percentage is provided by Pareto diagram of standardized effects for adsorption of CS (Fig. 7). In the multinomial equations, the impacts with total values greater than reference line are recognized as statistically significant factors, and the factors are set in order based on their significance. The four factors of ultrasound contact time, adsorbent mass, CS concentration and pH in sequence based on the acquired results from Pareto diagram were considered the most significant factors on the response (Fig. 7)."

Variation against responses is depicted in the three dimensional graphs following altering the variables (Fig. 8) at optimum condition while their curvatures provide clues for the presence of interaction among the variables. The three dimensional response surface plots related influence of initial CS concentration and ultrasound contact time is depicted in Fig. 8a which indicates that high removal of CS during 15min contact time came out from higher mass transfer because of notable phenomena stemmed from the presence of ultrasound waves. Both the availability of vacant sites of the adsorbent and high surface area can provide the initial high adsorption rate. Furthermore, Fig. 8a depicts the maximum factual amount of removed\nCS at higher initial CS concentrations. The adsorption percentage shows a significant decrease which stemmed from occupation and saturation of the available adsorbent sites. The relation of this phenomenon to decline in the mass gradient between the adsorbents and solution at higher CS content has been confirmed. To be more precise, the decrease in the driving force for molecular transfer from the bulk solution to the particle surface occurred. Lower CS concentration is commensurate with a higher ratio of solute to adsorbent vacant sites that give rise to an increase in CS adsorption [71]. In Fig. 8c the related influence of ultrasonic time and adsorbent mass as important parameters on both CS adsorption and the adsorption percentage is depicted. As it is shown,\nFig. 5. Correlation of experimental and predicted values on the ultrasound assisted adsorption of CS.\nFig. 6. Normal plot of residuals showing the relationship between normal probability (%) and internally residuals.\nboth CS adsorption and its percentage boosted when an increase from 2 to 25mg occurred in the adsorbent dosage. And as mentioned before CS concentration is commensurate with a greater surface area and more vacant site to absorb CS from aqueous solution. Based on Fig. 8b, the negative correlation of pH with the removal percentage has been confirmed while higher pH resulted in lower adsorption percentage achievement. Reduction of present groups on the surface of absorbent at low initial pH, resulted in the creation of positive charge and emergence of vigorous, intense affinity between the CS and adsorbent that bring on an increase in CS removal."

Under these optimal conditions and at ambient temperature, the adsorption was carried out and led to an achievement of 98.405% ± 3.87 which was an indication of a proper accordance between estimated and experimental results and confirmed suitability of proffered design as well."

It is noteworthy that in the current study the experimental results were fitted by Langmuir [74], Freundlich [75], Temkin [76] and Dubinin-radushkevich [77]. In Table 3, the correlation coefficients and constant parameters conform to plots of Freundlich, Temkin, D–R and Langmuir isotherm designs are presented. Proper usability of Langmuir isotherm for fitting results of CS adsorption on the g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 (R2=0.995) was confirmed by the results of isotherm survey. Moreover, the monolayer adsorption of the CS on the g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 surface was explainable by the Langmuir isotherm design."

The construction of ionic bonding between some functional groups such as NH2 and OH with adsorbent could be the main factor to cause the fast and high CS adsorption. As mentioned above, the electrostatic interaction especially the affinity of g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 for specific functional group may depend on Lewis acid-base character. In addition, solid surface of adsorbent mostly via electrostatic, H bond and other hydrophobic and/ or hydrophilic forces can effect on CS adsorption process. Meanwhile, concerning the role of adsorbent, it can be mentioned that the most possible mechanism is H-bonding between N, S, and O atoms of CS and H atom of COOH and OH group of g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6."

Using sonochemical synthesized Bi2WO6 implanted on graphitic carbon nitride/Multiwall carbon nanotube (g-C3N4/ MWCNT/Bi2WO6). For this purpose g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 was synthesized and characterized using diverse approaches including XRD, FE-SEM, XPS, EDS, HRTEM, FT-IR. Then, the contribution of conventional variables including pH, CS concentration, adsorbent dosage and ultrasound contact time were studied by central composite design (CCD) under response surface methodology (RSM). ANOVA was employed to the variable factors, and the most desirable operational conditions mass provided. Drug adsorption yield of 98.85% obtained under these defined conditions. Through conducting five experiments, the proper prediction of the optimum point were examined. The respective results showed that RSD% was lower than 5% while the t-test confirmed the high quality of fitting. Langmuir isotherm equation fits the experimental data best and the removal followed pseudosecond order kinetics. The estimation of the experimentally obtained maximum adsorption capacities was 19.57mg.g− of g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 for CS. Boundary layer diffusion explained the mechanism of removal via intraparticle diffusion.",
