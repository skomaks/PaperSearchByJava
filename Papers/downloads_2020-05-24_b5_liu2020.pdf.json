The mechanism was revealed in terms of migration resistance, chemical binding, and physical binding; and each aspect was determined with corresponding measurements, including microstructure of hydrates examined by XRD, EDS, TGA and NMR, and pore structure evaluated by MIP. Results reveal that the CNS dosage influenced immobilized chloride ratio (ICR). 0.5% CNS promoted the ICR, while more than 0.5% CNS decreased ICR. The promotion by 0.5% CNS was derived from the refined pore structure and the increased amount of C–S–H gel, which could enhance the migration resistance and physical binding; the decrease by more than 0.5% CNS was because of the reduced amount of chloroaluminates and the decreased Ca/Si ratio, leading to the decline in chemical binding and physical binding. Furthermore, curing age also affected ICR. 28-day ICR was higher than that at 7 d or 90 d. The increase of ICR from 7 d to 28 d was attributed to the refinement of pore structure and the increase in amount of chloroaluminates and C–S–H gel; reduction from 28 d to 90 d age was due to the negative effects including the decrease in content of chloroaluminates and the reduced Ca/Si ratio. The findings are expected to give new insight into the effect of nano-SiO2 on performance of cement-based materials."

      "text" : "Marine resources, such as sea sand and coral sand, have been received more and more attention in marine construction. However, chloride ions in these marine resources would diffuse and migrate in concrete, and most likely damage the surficial protection layer of steel bar, resulting in steel corrosion; in this case, concrete durability is challenged, and even the structure might be destroyed. This issue has deeply plagued the practitioners in industrial and research fields. Accordingly, in case of the use of sea resources in reinforced concrete, effective measures to avoid the risk of steel corrosion should be firstly considered [1,2].\nIn the literatures, the risk of corrosion of steel bar could be removed by means of corrosion inhibitor [3,4], protection layer coated on the surface of steel bar [5,6], chloride immobilized [7–9], and etc. And as reported, chloride immobilization, related to bind chloride in situ and resist chloride migration onto the surface of steel bar, showed great\npotential. Theoretically, the potential risk of steel corrosion could be significantly reduced and even removed, if chloride ions could be bound completely or its migration could be hindered efficiently.\nIn terms of chloride immobilization, three aspects should be considered: physical binding, chemical binding, and migration resistance [10–15]. Physical binding can be explained as the fact that free chloride is physically adsorbed by hydration products (e.g. C–S–H gel, with huge surface area, efficiently adsorbs chloride ion by electric double layer, while the physical binding capacity of other hydrates is negligible). Chemical binding is involved in reactions between chloride ions and AFm-like phase ([Ca2Al(OH)6⋅2H2O]þ) to form chloroaluminates including Friedel’s salt (FS, [Ca2Al (OH)6⋅2H2O]2⋅Cl2⋅4H2O) or Kuzel’s salt (KS, [Ca2Al (OH)6⋅2H2O]2⋅(SO4)0.5⋅Cl⋅6H2O) [16–18]. Migration resistance can be achieved through refining the pore structure to block the migration channel [19–21].\nFly ash (FA), as one of the most commonly used supplementary\n* Corresponding author.

The main reasons could be revealed in terms of the pozzolanic reaction of FA, which produces the C–S–H gel and releases aluminum into liquid phase. On the one hand, the produced C–S–H gel can physically bind chloride, and also refine the capillary to block the migration channel for chloride. On the other hand, the dissolved aluminum phase could react with chloride and calcium to form FS and KS as chemical binding. Based on the discussion above, it can be found that the chloride immobilization capacity can be enhanced when the hydration of FA is promoted, which has been already proved in our previous study [25,26].\nNano-SiO2 (NS), as a nanometer-scale material with high pozzolanic reactivity, can accelerate the hydration of both cement and FA in cement-FA system [27–31], and therefore, it is expected to promote the chloride immobilization. Firstly, NS with nano scale can block the migration channel of chloride. Secondly, the accelerated hydration of the system could produce more content of C–S–H gel to physically adsorb the chloride and further block the channel. Thirdly, the accelerated pozzolanic reaction of FA would release more amount of aluminum, thereby inducing the phase transformation of AFm structure to form FS or KS. However, other studies have shown that Ca/Si ratio of C–S–H gel, which would be changed by adding supplementary cementitious materials and prolonging the curing age, could noticeably affect the physical binding capacity [11,32]. On the other hand, variation in composition (i.e. Al/Si ratio) of C–S–H gel could influence the phase transformation of AFm structure, finally affecting the chemical binding capacity [25,26]. Obviously, the addition of NS into cement-FA system would influence the amount and composition of C–S–H gel, due to its pozzolanic reaction and the promotion of the hydration of both cement and FA; but this impact on chloride immobilization seems extremely unclear.\nIn order to clarify the issue mentioned above, colloidal nano-silica (CNS) was added into cement-FA system, and the effect of CNS on the chloride immobilization behavior was systematically investigated in this study. Chloride immobilization were analyzed in terms of physical binding, chemical binding, and migration resistance. Resistance to chloride migration, related to pore structure, was evaluated by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP); and properties including compressive strength and water absorption, were also tested as supplementary evidence to illustrate the compactness of the hardened paste. Chemical binding was discussed in regard of the formation of AFm structure, which was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) surface scan. Physical binding was studied in respect of composition and quantity of C–S–H gel, which was assessed by EDS spot scan, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Finally, the mechanism behind the effect on chloride immobilization was discussed. Such results are expected to provide useful experience for the promotion of chloride immobilization in cementitious materials."

Meanwhile, the increase/decrease ratio of ICR in CFN0.5 and CFN4 samples, compared with the control sample at the same age, are also labeled.\nIn Fig. 2, it is revealed that ICR of cement-FA system can be greatly influenced by the added dosage of CNS. With 0.5% CNS added, ICR is increased by 12.48% at 7 d age, by 10.86% at 28 d age, and by 16.96% at 90 d age, compared with the control sample. However, when the dosage is higher than 0.5%, ICR is reduced. For example, ICR of CFN4 (i.e. the sample with 4.0% CNS) is decreased by 28.89% at 7 d age, by 19.23% at 28 d age and by 34.88% at 90 d age, in comparison with the control sample. These results imply that in cement-FA system, effect of CNS on chloride immobilization capacity depends on the added dosage: less than 0.5% can promote the ICR, while the opposite is true for the dosage more than 0.5%.\nIn addition, ICR is closely related to the curing age. Regardless of the added dosage of CNS, ICR is increased from 7 d to 28 d, while it is decreased from 28 d to 90 d. Taking CFN0.5 for example, ICR at 28 d is 45.31%, being higher than that at 7 d (34.07%); at 90 d, it is decreased to be 40.00%, which is higher than that at 7 d while lower than that at 28 d. These results indicate that in cement-FA system, the curing age can be inferred as one of the factors influencing the chloride immobilization.\nFactors influencing the immobilization process of chloride in cement-based materials were involved in three aspects: migration resistance, chemical binding, and physical binding. Migration resistance is closely related to the pore structure; chemical binding is associated with the formation of FS and KS; physical binding is dependent on the amount and composition (especially the Ca/Si ratio) of C–S–H gel. These would be further investigated in the following text."

The pore size distributions of samples (CFN0, CFN0.5 and CFN4) with different CNS dosages at 28 d age and samples with 0.5% CNS at different ages are shown in the figure. And the most probable aperture (MPA), which is regarded as the pore size occupying the largest proportion, is also labeled in the figure.\nAs presented in Fig. 3a, the pore structure is obviously affected by the addition of CNS. When 0.5% CNS is added, the MPA is reduced from 39.98 nm in the control sample to 35.34 nm. And compared with CFN0, the pore size distribution curve of CFN0.5 moves toward the small pore. When CNS content is increased to 4%, the pore size distribution curve moves further toward the small pore, and MPA dropped to 29.60 nm. These results indicate the refined pore structure by addition of CNS.\nFig. 3b reveals the effect of curing age on the pore structure. With the prolongation of curing age, the pore size distribution curve continuously moves toward the small pore, and MPA is reduced from 66.80 nm at 7 d, to 35.34 nm at 28 d, and further to 30.23 nm at 90 d. These results\nFig. 2. ICR of samples at 7 d, 28 d and 90 d age.\nX. Liu et al.\nCement and Concrete Composites 110 (2020) 103596\nsuggest that the increase in curing age can also refine the pore structure. Consequently, one conclusion can be drawn that the addition of CNS can refine the pore structure, which is attributed to the filling effect of CNS and the hydration products formed with nano scale [46–49].

In the figure, compared with the control sample, WA of CFN0.5 decreases by about 8%, and 4% CNS reduces WA by about 20%, regardless of the curing age. These results demonstrate that the addition of CNS can evidently reduce the water absorption (WA), and the effect is promoted by the increasing dosage. In addition, WA of samples are notably decreased with the prolongation of curing age as shown in Fig. 4. For example, WA of CFN0.5 is 13.84% at 7 d, 10.93% at 28 d, and 9.47% at 90 d. The reason can be explained by the fact that at longer curing age, more hydrates are produced to refine pore structure. The results of water absorption, reflecting the superficial pore structure, provide supplementary evidence to prove the refinement of pore structure by adding CNS, which contributed to the migration resistance of chloride."

And the relative ratio of increase in compressive strength of CFN0.5 and CFN4 compared with the control sample at three ages (7 d, 28 d and 90 d) are also labeled in the figure. It can be seen that addition of CNS obviously increases the strength, in agreement with the results reported in the literatures [27]. 0.5% CNS increases the strength by 2.77% at 7 d, by 11.46% at 28 d, and by 6.66% at 90 d age in comparison with the control; and higher dosage of CNS further leads to stronger enhancement of strength; with 4% dosage of CNS added, it is increased by 24.68% at 7 d, by 37.15% at 28 d, and by 30.80% at 90 d age, which are much higher than that with 0.5% CNS. Furthermore, the compressive strength increases notably with the curing age, and this is widely accepted in the literatures, due to that further hydration of the system provides more hydrates contributing to the strength. Since pore structure is one of the main factors influencing the compressive strength [50–52], the strength results can reflect that the pore structure of cement-FA system is refined by adding CNS and prolonging the curing age, in agreement with the results in MIP and water absorption.\nBased on discussion about MIP, water absorption, and compressive strength, it is concluded that with addition of CNS and prolongation of curing age, the pore structure of cement-FA paste is refined and the structure is densified, which can contribute to the migration resistance of chloride.\nFig. 4.

The results are presented in Table 3.\nFig. 6a presents the XRD patterns of samples with different CNS dosages at 28 d age. The result indicates that with the increase in CNS dosage, the peak intensities of FS and KS are reduced, while that for AFt seems no different. And the decline in contents of FS and KS can also be reflected in Table 3: FS content is 1.12% in CFN0 sample, while 1.09% in CFN0.5 sample and 1.00% in CFN4 sample; KS content is 0.21%, 0.19% and 0.16% in CFN0, CFN0.5 and CFN4, respectively. The reduction in contents of FS and KS suggests that addition of CNS can perturb the formation of chloroaluminate, and the higher CNS dosage is, the stronger hindrance can be found. Furthermore, the reduction in the\ncontent of chloride bound by FS and KS with increase in CNS dosage can be found in Table 3, suggesting that the chloride chemical binding capacity is reduced by CNS, which is rarely reported in the literatures.\nFig. 6b shows the XRD patterns of CFN0.5 cured at different ages. Compared with 7 d, peak intensity of FS increases slightly at 28 d but then decreases notably at 90 d, while change in peak intensity of KS is negligible from 7 d to 90 d. From Table 3, it can also be found that FS content slightly increases from 1.04% at 7 d to 1.09% at 28 d and then decreases to 0.74% at 90 d. And the content of KS continuously decreases from 0.20% at 7 d to 0.17% at 90 d. It is noted that the content of FS is much higher than that of KS, and therefore, the content of FS probably determines the chloride chemical binding capacity.

      "text" : "In this section, EDS spot scan was conducted to illustrate the composition (i.e. Ca/Si ratio) of C–S–H gel to discuss the physical binding capacity of C–S–H gel, and the results are listed in Table 4.\nAs shown in Table 4, the average Ca/Si ratio at the age of 28 d is reduced to from 1.80 in reference to 1.71 by adding 0.5% CNS, and the further reduction to 1.61 by 4% CNS is also observed. These results indicate that addition of CNS can decrease the Ca/Si ratio, thereby reducing the chloride binding capacity of C–S–H gel.\nTable 4 also reveals the change of Ca/Si ratio with the curing age. The Ca/Si ratio decreases negligibly from 7 d to 28 d age, and then further decreases to 1.20 at 90 d. The reason is related to the pozzolanic reaction of FA. The slight decrease is due to the fact that the pozzolanic reaction of FA before the age of 28 days is very weak, and the obvious decrease is because the reaction happens obviously from 28 days to 90 days. Based on this, chloride binding capacity of the system in regard of C–S–H gel should almost keep constant before 28 d but be significantly reduced after the age of 28 d."

      "heading" : "3.4.2. Amount of C–S–H gel",
      "text" : "TGA was used to analyze the amount of C–S–H gel. DTG patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 7. As reported in the literatures, the DTG peak around 100 �C is mainly attributed to the dehydration of C–S–H gel and AFt, and the overlapping peak is difficult to be distinguished. FS and KS have overlapping peaks, and the two main dehydroxylation peaks for FS and KS exist at 100–150 �C and 230–410 �C [9,16,18,54]. The peak around 430–450 �C is derived from the dehydration of CH. And the corresponding peaks are marked in figures as the above. The CH content calculated based on this weight loss is listed in Table 5.\nIn Fig. 8a, with the increase in CNS dosage, the decline in peak intensity of CH can be observed. And the change of CH contents in Table 5 further reveal that CH content is reduced to 11.78% by adding 0.5% CNS, and to 7.95% by adding 4% CNS, from 13.74% in the control sample at 28 d. These results demonstrate that addition of CNS reduces the content of CH at 28 d, in agreement with the results in XRD. The main reason for this is attributed to the fact that the CH is consumed by the pozzolanic reaction of CNS, which can produce C–S–H gel. This result implicates that with addition of CNS, especially in the case of high CNS dosage, more amount of C–S–H gel can be produced. In addition, as shown in Fig. 8b and Table 5, the longer age leads to the lower CH content. This can be explained by the fact that CH is continuously consumed by the pozzolanic reaction of CNS and FA, with producing the main hydrates (i.e. C–S–H gel). Accordingly, longer curing age leads to more amount of C–S–H gel.\nThe hydrates of the cement-FA system were also characterized by 29Si MAS NMR, and deconvoluted spectra and fitted peaks are plotted in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9a, Q0, Q3 and Q4 can be seen clearly; Q0 presents the unhydrated Si–O tetrahedron in cement minerals, and Q3 and Q4 manifest the Si–O tetrahedrons in FA. In Fig. 9b–f, peaks of Q1, Q2 (1Al) and Q2 can be seen clearly, indicating the hydration of the cement and FA. Based on the results of Fig. 9, MCL, Al/Si ratio and the reaction degrees of cement (AC) and FA (AFA) are calculated [55,56], and the results are shown in Table 6.\nAs revealed in Table 6, with the increase in CNS dosage, AC and AFA is increased obviously; at the age of 28 d, AC and AFA of the reference (CFN0) are 64.98% and 12.98%, and addition of 0.5% CNS can increase them to 73.17% and 14.71%; further increase in dosage to 4% can increase them to 77.01% and 15.53%. These results indicate that CNS can facilitate the hydration of cement and FA. With the increase in curing age, the hydration degree of cement and FA are also promoted. AC and AFA of CFN0.5 at 7 d are 55.23% and 3.64%, and at the age of 28 d, they increase to 73.17% and 14.71%; and further increase in curing age to 90 d can increase them to 81.60% and 23.13%. Accordingly, with the increase in curing age and the addition of CNS, there are higher hydration\nX. Liu et al.\nCement and Concrete Composites 110 (2020) 103596\ndegree to produce more amount of C–S–H gel, and this result is in agreement with the results in TGA.\nFurthermore, it can also be seen that the substitution of Si by Al (Al/ Si ratio) and MCL of C–S–H gel are increased by the addition of CNS and the prolongation of curing age in Table 6. The higher Al content in C–S–H gel can be revealed from the fact that when the hydration degree\nof FA is raised, one part of aluminum released from FA takes part into formation of C-A-S-H gel. The absorption of aluminum by C–S–H gel increases the polymerization degree, resulting in a higher MCL value and the decrease in Ca/Si ratio of C–S–H gel, with decline in chloride binding capacity, in accordance with the result of EDS spot scan. The other part of aluminum dissolved from FA into liquid phase is available\nX. Liu et al.\nCement and Concrete Composites 110 (2020) 103596\nfor the formation of aluminum-containing hydrates (e.g. FS and KS). This seems to contribute to the chloride binding capacity, while the XRD results showed the decline in amount of FS and KS by increase in curing age and added dosage of CNS, indicating that most of aluminum dissolved from FA has taken part into the reaction of the formation of C-AS-H gel.\nBased on discussion about EDS, TG and NMR, the increase in added dosage of CNS and the curing age can facilitate the hydration of both cement and FA in system, resulting in the increase in amount of C–S–H gel and the decrease in Ca/Si ratio. The increase in amount of C–S–H gel benefits the physical binding capacity while the decreased Ca/Si ratio tends to reduce the physical binding."

      "text" : "Based on discussion mentioned above, the mechanism behind difference in chloride immobilization, being involved in CNS added dosage and the curing age, can be revealed in terms of migration resistance, physical binding and chemical binding.\nFig. 10 reveals the chloride distribution in samples. The chloride in bulk solution means the free chloride ion in the pore solution, which was determined by the experiment. The chloride immobilized chemically is related to the chloride ions in FS and KS, and its content is calculated according to the data in Table 3. However, the migration resistance and physical binding are difficult to be accurately distinguished in this study, and therefore, these two are categorized as chloride immobilized in other way. As shown in Fig. 10, the content of chloride bound chemically increases at 28 d but decreases at 90 d in CNA0, CNA0.5, and CNA4 samples. However, the content of chloride immobilized in other ways increases at 28 d, and keeps stable at 90 d in all the samples. These results indicate that the relative proportions of different immobilization\nways to the total ICR changes with the extension of curing age."

      "text" : "As shown in Fig. 2, with addition of CNS from 0% to 4%, the highest value of ICR is found at the dosage of 0.5%. The reason can be explained as follow:\nFirstly, improvement in pore structure by CNS is confirmed in section 3.2, and this could block the channel for chloride ion transportation. In this case, chloride migration resistance is enhanced, with contribution to ICR. In terms of chemical binding, the presence of CNS hinders the formation of FS and KS, with decline in ICR. Even though addition of CNS accelerates the hydration of FA to release the aluminum phase into liquid phase, C–S–H gel formed can obviously consume the aluminum as a result of the formation of C-A-S-H gel, so that there is little aluminum phase available for formation of FS and KS. Moreover, addition of CNS increases the amount of C–S–H gel, with contribution to the ICR. Additionally, the presence of CNS decreases its Ca/Si ratio, with negative effect on ICR.\nBased on the above analysis, these four aspects should determine the ICR of the system. Obviously, with the CNS dosage less than 0.5%, the two positive aspects, namely the increased amount of C–S–H gel and the refined pore structure, should be dominated, and accordingly, ICR of the system is higher than that of the reference (without CNS). However, with the dosage more than 0.5%, the negative aspects, namely the reduced amount of FS and KS in hydrates and the decreased Ca/Si ratio, is dominated, and therefore, ICR is reduced with the increasing dosage of CNS."

      "heading" : "3.5.2. Effects of curing age on ICR",
      "text" : "As shown in Fig. 2, the curing age obviously affects the ICR, and ICR at the age of 28 d is higher than that at 7d or 90 d, which means that with the prolongation of curing age, ICR increases firstly and then reduces. The reason can be convincingly explained as follow:\nIn terms of migration resistance, it is obvious that the prolongation of curing age can refine the pore structure, which would significantly hinder the transportation of chloride ions, with benefit to migration resistance. Furthermore, phase analysis confirmed that at the age of 28 d, the greatest amount of chloride bound by FS and KS can be observed; accordingly, the chemical binding capacity shows the higher value at the age of 28 d. Additionally, with the prolongation of curing age, the amount of C–S–H gel would be increased, with contribution to ICR, while the Ca/Si ratio would be reduced, which has negative effect on ICR.\nBased on the above analysis, the effect of curing age on ICR can be decided by these four aspects, including negative effects and positive effects. From the age of 7 d–28 d, ICR is significantly increased due to the refinement of pore structure, the increase in the amount of chloride bound by FS and KS, and the increase in the content of C–S–H gel. Reduction of ICR from 28 d to 90 d age is attributed to the negative effects including the decrease in content of FS and KS and the reduced Ca/Si ratio.\nTable 6 Deconvolution results of the samples.\nunhydrated CFN0 CFN0.5 hydrated for 7 d CFN0 hydrated for 28 d CFN0.5 hydrated for 28 d CFN4 hydrated for 28 d CFN0.5 hydrated for 90 d\nQ0(%) 66.81 29.91 23.40 17.92 15.36 12.30 Q1(%) / 25.02 26.20 26.72 27.65 29.97 Q2(%) / 8.91 13.40 17.45 17.36 15.91 Q2(1Al) (%) / 4.18 8.12 9.60 11.60 16.31 Q3þQ4(%) 33.19 31.98 28.88 28.31 28.03 25.51 AC (%) 55.23 64.98 73.17 77.01 81.60 AFA (%) 3.64 12.98 14.71 15.53 23.13 MCL 3.21 3.95 4.38 4.51 4.69 Al/Si (%) 5.49 8.51 8.93 10.24 13.11\nX.

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "1) The CNS dosage and the curing age can both significantly influence the chloride immobilization in cement-FA system. In comparison with the reference, the addition of 0.5% CNS enhances ICR by 10.86% at 28 d; but ICR is reduced with the dosage more than 0.5% (e.g., 4% CNS reduces ICR by 19.23% at 28 d). And regardless of the added dosage of CNS, ICR increases from 7d to 28 d while declines from 28 d to 90 d (e.g., ICRs of CNA0.5 are 34.07% at 7 d, 45.31% at 28 d, and 40.00% at 90 d). 2) With the addition of CNS into cement-FA system, positive effects on ICR are related to the refined pore structure and the increased amount of C–S–H gel, and negative effects are the declined amount of FS and KS as well as reduction in Ca/Si ratio of C–S–H gel. In the samples with less than 0.5% CNS, the increased ICR with the dosage is because of the increased amount of C–S–H gel and the refined pore structure, while the decline of ICR with the dosage more than 0.5% is due to the reduced amount of FS and KS in hydrates and the decreased Ca/Si ratio. 3) From 7 d to 28 d, the improvement in migration resistance, chemical binding and physical binding results in a significant increase in ICR. However, when the curing age prolongs to 90 d, ICR becomes lower due to the strong negative impact from the reduced amount of chloride bound by FS and KS and the decreased Ca/Si ratio of C–S–H gel."

The mechanism was revealed in terms of migration resistance, chemical binding, and physical binding; and each aspect was determined with corresponding measurements, including microstructure of hydrates examined by XRD, EDS, TGA and NMR, and pore structure evaluated by MIP. Results reveal that the CNS dosage influenced immobilized chloride ratio (ICR). 0.5% CNS promoted the ICR, while more than 0.5% CNS decreased ICR. The promotion by 0.5% CNS was derived from the refined pore structure and the increased amount of C–S–H gel, which could enhance the migration resistance and physical binding; the decrease by more than 0.5% CNS was because of the reduced amount of chloroaluminates and the decreased Ca/Si ratio, leading to the decline in chemical binding and physical binding. Furthermore, curing age also affected ICR. 28-day ICR was higher than that at 7 d or 90 d. The increase of ICR from 7 d to 28 d was attributed to the refinement of pore structure and the increase in amount of chloroaluminates and C–S–H gel; reduction from 28 d to 90 d age was due to the negative effects including the decrease in content of chloroaluminates and the reduced Ca/Si ratio. The findings are expected to give new insight into the effect of nano-SiO2 on performance of cement-based materials.",
