Among the AMP molecules, bacteriocins are produced by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species and are used to kill or inhibit other prokaryotes in the environment. Due to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, some bacteriocins have the potential of becoming the next generation of antibiotics for use in the crisis of multi antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Recently, bacteriocins have even been used to treat cancer. However, bacteriocins present a few drawbacks, such as sensitivity to proteases, immunogenicity issues, and the development of bacteriocin resistance by pathogenic bacteria. In this regard, nanoscale drug delivery systems (Nano-DDS) have led to the expectation that they will eventually improve the treatment of many diseases by addressing these limitations and improving bacteriocin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Thus, combining bacteriocins with nano-DDS may be useful in overcoming these drawbacks and thereby reveal the full potential of bacteriocins. In this review article, we highlight the importance of tailoring nano-DDS to address bacteriocin limitations, the successes and failures of this technology thus far, the challenges that this technology still has to overcome before reaching the market, and future perspectives. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to highlight, categorize, compare and contrast the different nano-DDS described in the literature so far, and compare their effectiveness in order to improve the next generation of bacteriocin nano-sized drug delivery systems (Nano-DDS)."

They are produced by several species (from bacteria to mammals) and are used to kill or inhibit the growth of other microbes in the environment [1]. To date, more than 1700 different AMPs have been described [2], and they mediate different biological effects, such as damage and destabilization of bacterial and fungal membranes or viral capsules, recruitment of immune cells at inflammatory sites, and promotion of wound repair and angiogenesis [1]."

      "text" : "Due to their large variety, bacteriocins can be classified by several parameters, such as molecular mass, activity, chemical structure, heatstability and the presence of post-translationally modified amino acids [3]. The first bacteriocin classification system was proposed by Klaenhammer in 1993 [3,5], wherein bacteriocins were divided into 4 classes. Class I bacteriocins were also called Lantibiotics and they were comprised of peptides of less than 5 kDa and contained the unusual amino acids lanthionine and/or beta-methyl lanthionine. Class II bacteriocins were less than 10 kDa in size and they exhibited moderate (100 °C) to high (121 °C) heat stability. This class was divided into\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.02.001 Received 13 December 2019; Received in revised form 1 February 2020; Accepted 1 February 2020\n⁎ Corresponding author at: Department of Orofacial Sciences, University of California San Francisco, School of Dentistry, 513 Parnassus Avenue, S616C, Box 0422, San Francisco, CA 94143, United States of America.\nE-mail address: Yvonne.Kapila@ucsf.edu (Y.L.

Subclass IIa were comprised of Listeria-active peptides that contain a specific N-terminal sequence (Tyr-Gly-Asn-GlyVal-Xaa-Cys-). Subclass IIb were comprised of poration complexes, which consisted of two proteinaceous peptides integrated together. Subclass IIc were comprised of thiol-activated peptides that required reduced cysteine residues. Class III bacteriocins were comprised of peptides larger than 30 kDa in size and they were heat labile. Class IV bacteriocins were complex and comprised of one or more macromolecules, such as lipids and carbohydrates, which were required for their activity.\nHowever, this classification system grouped very different bacteriocins together, especially the Class II, III and IV bacteriocins, since little information existed about those bacteriocins at that time [5]. Recently, this classification system was abandoned, and bacteriocins are now classified into 3 major classes [4,6]. Class I bacteriocins contain 19–50 amino acids and are extensively post-translationally modified, resulting in non-standard amino acid structures, such as lanthionine, beta-methyllanthionine, dehydrobutyrine, dehydroalanine, and labionin. Class I is further subdivided into Lantibiotics (Class Ia), bacteriocins that contain lanthionine and/or beta-methyllanthionine amino acids, Labyrintopeptins (Class Ib), bacteriocins that contain the amino acid labionin [7]; and Sactibiotics (Class Ic), bacteriocins that contain cysteine sulphur to α‑carbon linkages [8]. Class II bacteriocins contain small (< 10 kDa) heat-stable and non-modified peptides. Class II are further subdivided into Pediocin-like bacteriocins (Class IIa), twopeptide bacteriocins (Class IIb), circular bacteriocins (Class IIc), and linear non-Pediocin-like bacteriocins (Class IId). Class III bacteriocins generally contain large (> 30 kDa) heat-labile peptides and little is known about them."

      "heading" : "1.4. Bacteriocin mode of action",
      "text" : "Several modes of action have been described for bacteriocins. For instance, pediocin PA-1, a class IIa bacteriocin produced by gram-positive Pediococcus spp [6], promotes the disruption of the proton motive force and membrane permeation; mechanisms driven by receptor-dependent binding [9]. Nisin, a class I bacteriocin, produced by grampositive Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus lactis [6], has a dual mechanism of action. Nisin uses a key peptidoglycan precursor as a docking molecule and prevents cell wall synthesis in the target bacteria [10]. After docking on the cells membrane, nisin promotes the formation of a pore in the membrane, which seems to be driven by a membrane potential Δψ-dependent manner [9]. On the other hand, colicins seem to have a more complex mechanism of action. For instance, the colicin E series, a series of class III bacteriocins produced by the gramnegative Escherichia coli [6], penetrates the sensitive E. coli strain's cytoplasm in a Tol system-dependent manner (i.e., via BtuB receptor), and then inhibits the target bacteria by cleaving either their DNA (colicins E2, E7, E8 and E9), 16S RNA (colicins E3, E4 and E6), or tRNA (colicin E5) [11,12]. Conversely, colicin M (also a class I bacteriocin produced by E. coli) penetrates the membrane in a Ton system-dependent manner, and then digests the peptidoglycan precursors, leading to cell death [12,13]."

      "heading" : "1.5. Bacteriocin advantages",
      "text" : "Bacteriocins present several advantageous characteristics as antimicrobials. In addition to their low toxicity to eukaryotic cells, they have minimal inhibitory concentrations against several bacterial strains, usually in the nanomolar range, and have high-temperature stability [4,14]. Together, these qualities have brought attention to bacteriocins as potential antibacterial agents. Currently, nisin, pediocin and Micocin® (which is comprised of carnocyclin A, carnobacteriocin BM1, and piscicolin 126 bacteriocins combined together) [3] are the only bacteriocins approved by the FDA for use as food preserving and anti-spoilage agents and are commercially available in the US and\nCanada. Some bacteriocins also present a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, and they show promise in addressing the crisis of multi antibiotic-resistant bacteria [4].\nBacteriocins have also been highlighted for their biomedical applications [15]. Nisin is an effective therapeutic for oral cancer and it spares normal cells and tissues [15–17]. Joo et al. [18] demonstrated that low-content nisin (2.5%) reduces the proliferation of and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), without significantly affecting primary normal keratinocytes, in vitro and in vivo. The authors further demonstrated that a proapoptotic cation transport regulator (i.e. CHAC1) dependent- and independent-pathway are responsible for the reduced HNSCC tumorigenesis. Kamarajan et al. [16] also demonstrated that high content nisin ZP (95%) induces apoptosis via a calpain-dependent pathway in HNSCC, but not in keratinocytes in vitro. The authors further demonstrated that high-content nisin reduced HNSCC tumorigenesis and extended in vivo survival, with no evidence of inflammation, fibrosis or necrosis in the liver, lung, or kidneys. These findings demonstrate the potential biomedical application of bacteriocins, especially in cancer treatment."

      "heading" : "1.6. Bacteriocin drawbacks",
      "text" : "Despite all these advantages, bacteriocins also have drawbacks. Bacteriocin use has led to the development of bacteriocin resistance by pathogenic and food spoilage bacteria. This is a rising concern, especially with regards to food safety in the food industry, since this has been the primary bacteriocin application [3,6]. For example, natural resistance to Class I bacteriocins has already been reported in Lactobacillus casei [19], Streptococcus thermophilus [20], Streptococcus bovei [21], Streptococcus pneumoniae [22], Pediococcus acidilactici [23], Listeria monocytogenes [24], Listeria innocua [25], Bacillus cereus [26], bacillus subtilis [27], Staphylococcus aureus [28], Clostridium botulinum [29], and Clostridium difficile [30]. In addition, natural resistance to class IIa bacteriocins has been reported in 1–8% of the wild-type strains tested [4].\nAccording to Zhou et al. [31], there are five different main resistance mechanisms described for bacteriocins in gram-positive bacteria: i) cell wall modifications, such as neutralization of the cell wall net negative charge [6,30,32]; ii) modifications of the membrane phospholipid composition, such as a decrease in anionic phospholipids in the membrane [29]; iii) enzymatic inactivation of the bacteriocins, such as by nisinase [33] or nisin resistance protein (NRP) [34]; iv) via the ABC transporter [24]; and v) via cell envelope regulatory networks, such as VanRS and LiaRS [24,27,28]. For a more complete explanation of bacteriocin resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive bacteria, the reader is directed to Zhou et al. [31].\nIn contrast, Gram-negative bacteria, as a result of their outer membrane, are naturally more resistant to bacteriocins than gram-positive bacteria [14]. In this regard, relevant strategies, such as the addition of EDTA, have been used to destabilize the bacterial outer membrane, thus enabling bacteriocins to gain entry to mediate their action [14,35–37]. However, several factors can affect the sensitivity to this treatment. For instance, the activity of EDTA is pH sensitive, being more effective at a neutral pH, whereas bacteriocins, such as nisin, are more effective at an acidic pH [14].\nDue to their proteinaceous nature, most bacteriocins are sensitive to proteases, such as proteinase K and pepsin [12,38]. Thus, one of the obvious mechanisms of bacteriocin resistance is through the use of enzymatic degradation. For example, specific enzymes can degrade nisin (nisinase or NRP [26,34]), making nisin more prone to enzymatic degradation than other bacteriocins.\nFinally, there are still major concerns about the safety of bacteriocins for therapy when compared to small molecule drugs. There are currently limited studies on bacteriocin pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity, and immunogenicity [39–42]. Pharmacokinetics\nand pharmacodynamics of drugs are key factors to consider for any in vivo therapeutics [43]. Usually, short peptides (< 50 amino acids) have poor pharmacokinetic profiles due to their inability to cross biological barriers (e.g., plasma membranes), fast clearance due to renal filtration, and can be bound/cleaved by serum proteins [44]. For instance, Ghobrial et al. [45] demonstrate that the Lantibiotic MU1140 binds significantly (92.7%) to blood serum components, decreasing the bacteriocin bioavailability, and, thus, inhibiting its activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae. This problem can be aggravated with certain bacteriocins, which are unstable under physiological pH, reducing even further their distribution and bioavailability [43]. However, literature on bacteriocin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is very limited.\nRegarding bacteriocin safety, it is known that AMPs, in general, can act as host sensitizers/allergens, which may lead to host immune sensitization (immunogenicity), particularly after repeated injections [46]. Bacteriocins could elicit a similar response, mainly because they are bacterial byproducts. Previous reports show that Bacteriocin TSU4 [42] and BLS P34 [39] administered with Freund's complete adjuvant resulted in a significant increase in antibody titer at day 21 and 42 for TSU4 and only at day 42 for BLS P43, when compared to control mice, but not the free bacteriocins. Thus, indicating a mild immune reaction in vivo. Although not tested by the authors, several bacteriocin injections could elicit larger immune response, as the system has been sensitized with the first injection. On the other hand, other reports have shown that bacteriocins, i.e. nisin, has an LD50 in mice 6950 mg/kg [39,47], has no toxicity on oral cells in vitro [48] and on the intestine, kidney, and liver of mice [16,39], and has no in vivo teratogenicity [49]. Thus, more studies are still needed to demonstrate the safety of bacteriocins.\nTherefore, one alternative to overcoming these bacteriocin limitations and to realize their full potential for biomedical applications one can combine bacteriocins with nanoscale drug delivery systems (nanoDDS)."

      "heading" : "1.7. Nanoscale drug delivery systems (Nano-DDS)",
      "text" : "Nanotechnology refers to the research field of understanding and controlling matter in the nanometer-range (1–1000 nm). At this scale, materials present several unique properties, such as larger surface-tomass ratio, increased activity, and the possibility of intracellular delivery of therapeutics when compared to their bulkier counterparts [50,51]. The development of nanoscale drug delivery systems (NanoDDS) has led to the expectation that they will eventually improve the treatment of many diseases by addressing limitations with other drug delivery systems. Many nano-DDS have already been approved for clinical use [52,53]. For instance, Abraxane [52], Doxil [54], DaunoXone [55], Marqibo [56], and Onivyde [52,57] are nano-sized drug delivery systems carrying anti-cancer drugs that were FDA approved for clinical use. The major advantage of these systems over their free drug counterparts is their lower toxicity and their capacity to accumulate at tumor sites via enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects in tumor tissues [52]. Nano-DDS are designed to modify the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of their active load, protecting it from degradative enzymes and promoting a sustained-release of the active drug by acting as a drug reservoir inside the tissue/cell [58].\nSpecifically, Nano-DDS can potentially improve bacteriocins in, at least, three different ways. i) Nano-DDS can improve bacteriocin pharmacokinetics parameters, such as changing the solubility, charge, and stability of bacteriocins, thus, increasing their activity, shelf-life, bioavailability, and bacteriocin half-life in body fluids [59–61]. For instance, Cao et al. [62] demonstrated that polymeric nanoparticles could be used to protect proteins and peptides from digestive enzymes and increase their absorption for oral delivery. In addition, Myerson et al. [63] demonstrated that a thrombin-inhibiting peptide encapsulated in perfluorocarbon nanoparticle outperforms heparin and\nthe free peptide in anti-thrombotic activity in vivo. Interestingly, this would also decrease the bacteriocin payload needed to effectively treat the diseased site; ii) Nano-DDS can be engineered to assist with bacteriocin safety issues, such as immunogenicity, by evading the host immune response [60], as nano-DDS can be engineered with a particular size, shape and surface properties to either minimize their recognition by the immune system or even to enhance their immune detection to deliver vaccines [64–66]. For instance, rod- and discshaped nanoparticles significantly induce more complement activation compared to spherical carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles in vivo [67]. In addition, several studies demonstrated that nanoparticle hydrophobic surfaces, such as aliphatic and aromatic moieties, are associated with increased cytokine expression and even dendritic cell maturation [65]. ii) Nano-DDS can improve bacteriocin effectiveness against bacterial resistance mechanisms. This can be accomplished by placing bacteriocins inside of the delivery systems, and thereby protecting them from degradative enzymes produced by resistant bacteria [59–61,68] or enabling them to overcome microbial resistance mechanisms, such as modified cell membranes or cell walls or escape bacteriocin transporter resistance mechanisms. For instance, bacteriocin-loaded nano-DDS (especially metallic nanoparticles) can either specifically disrupt bacterial cell membranes or cell walls, damaging the bacterial proton-efflux pumps or inducing oxidative stress in the bacteria [69]; iii) Compared to the free bacteriocin, nano-DDS can deliver bacteriocins to diseased tissues either extracellularly or intracellularly after being endocytosed by the diseased cells or by delivery to specific microbes, thus increasing bacteriocin action [52].\nFig. 1 shows the number of articles in the MEDLINE/PubMed database that contain the terms “drug delivery” and “bacteriocins”. From 2007 to 2018, there was an increasing trend through the years showing from 2 to 10 research papers per 100,000 published papers in a given year. The objective of this paper is to provide a review of bacteriocins delivered by drug delivery systems, discuss the challenges with this technology, including issues related to marketability, and present perspectives on the path from the development of Nano-DDS to clinical applications."

Fig. 2 illustrates the percentage of bacteriocin-based nanosized-drug delivery systems reported in the literature. Nisin was the most studied bacteriocin in drug delivery systems, reported by more than three-quarters (76.3%) of all the research articles found, followed by Bacteriocin-like substance P34\n(7.8%), Plantaricin 432 (5.3%), pediocin PA-1, Enterocin, Bacteriocinlike substance P40, and ST4SA, (each 2.6%)."

      "heading" : "2.1. Nisin",
      "text" : "Nisin is a Class I (Lantibiotic) bacteriocin produced by the Grampositive Lactococcus lactis [68]. It contains 34 amino acids in a pentacyclic structure with a lanthionine residue in Ring A and one methyllanthionine residue on the other rings (B, C, D, and E) [3]. Nisin is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including Streptococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes [68]. Due to its antibacterial potential, nisin was approved as a food additive by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1988 [15,70]. To date, nisin is the most utilized bacteriocin and is the only bacteriocin used in food preservation in more than 50 countries [15,68,71].\nHowever, nisin use is limited by its structural instability and the development of resistant/tolerant strains [31,72,73]. Nisin resistance has been reported among gram-positive bacteria [31], especially among Staphylococcus aureus, wherein nisin resistance can arise readily [73], and Listeria monocytogenes [72]. Although most of the nisin resistance mechanisms are not yet completely known [15], one of the most wellcharacterized nisin resistance mechanisms is through the nisin resistance gene/protein (NSR). NSR inactivates nisin by cleaving the peptide bond between the methylated lantionine-28 and serine-29, resulting in a truncated nisin. The truncated nisin has significantly decreased membrane affinity, significantly lower pore formation ability, and a 100-fold decrease in its antimicrobial activity [70,74]. Moreover, nisin effectiveness can also be affected by environmental factors, such as pH and temperature [31]. Therefore, these limitations are an excellent opportunity for the use of nano-DDS, which can improve nisin efficacy by protecting it from enzymatic degradation and environmental factors, and by assisting against bacterial resistance mechanisms.\nWe found only 34 original research articles on Nano-DDS containing nisin over a period of 16 years (i.e., between 2003 and 2019), meaning about 2 research articles per year were published on this subject. These observations indicate that there has been limited effort in this field up to now, and nisin was the most researched bacteriocin on nano-DDS. Interestingly, all the articles focused only on the antimicrobial activity of nisin (either for food preservation or as an antibiotic against pathogens).\nFig. 3 shows the distribution of nanoparticle types used in these articles and they are normalized by the total number of research articles found. About 40% of the research articles found for nisin-delivery focused on either using liposomes, followed by chitosan, nanofibers, and carbohydrate nanoparticles (approximately 20%, 14%, and 7% for each, respectively). However, gold, silver, poly-L-lactide, poly-ε-caprolactone, solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers were the least prescribed Nano-DDS at 3.5% each.\nTable 1 summarizes all the nisin-delivered nano-DDS and their main\napplication, entrapment efficiency, effectiveness of the application, and other main characteristics. Some studies indicated a significant increase in nisin antimicrobial potency when complexed with DDS compared to nisin alone [75–79]. This increase in antimicrobial activity may result from the nano-DDS delivering the bacteriocin directly to the site of action and the modulation of the bacteriocin's physical-chemical properties, which may increase the antimicrobial potency of nisin [61]. Metallic nanoparticles, such as silver and gold nanoparticles, on the other hand, also possess antimicrobials properties [80] and can synergistically increase the efficacy of the bacteriocin [61]. Saravana et al. [77], for instance, developed a biologically synthesized silver nanoparticle with a Bacillus spp. culture method (Fig. 4) and demonstrated an increased efficacy against Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus sp., Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Escherichia coli, Enterococcus sp., and Candida albicans when Nisin and Silver nanoparticles are combined.\nThe majority of the studies demonstrated that nisin exhibited a sustained release, thus, increasing the effectiveness of the bacteriocin over time, when compared to free nisin. Nano-DDS nisin remained active up to 50 days at 4 °C after inoculation, whereas nisin alone lost its inhibitory effect after 7 days after the inoculation [72,75,81–86]. In other words, using nano-DDS for delivering nisin increased the bacteriocin inhibitory effect 7-fold over time when compared to using the free nisin alone. This effect may be due to the nano-DDS acting as a drug reservoir for the bacteriocin by protecting the load from degradation and slowly delivering the bacteriocin over time [61], since they demonstrated the ability of the nano-DDS to efficiently encapsulate nisin up to 100% of the nisin load. Although the majority of the nisin load is not in direct contact with the cells, the entrapped nisin is slowly released over time by diffusion [83,87], bacterial degradation [88] and/or polymer erosion [87]. This slow release of the bacteriocin can protect nisin from degradation, thus prolonging nisin availability over time, compared to the free bacteriocin. Even low entrapment efficiency (EE) of nisin (i.e., carbohydrate nanoparticles composed of phytoglycogen modified with octenyl-succinate - 5% [76] and liposome composed of propanediol and lecithin - 9.5% [89]) improved its efficacy over time. The only exception to this was the nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) composed of glyceryl tristearate, oleic acid and tween 80 [90], which demonstrated a lower nisin efficacy than free nisin over time. This decrease in efficiency could be explained by a high affinity of nisin for the NLC rather than the bacterial membrane, leading to a very low release of the bacteriocin into the media.\nWith regards to the lower EE values for carbohydrate nanoparticles, these nanoparticles are typically assembled from digestible polysaccharides or indigestible fibers [91], but little is known about these nanoparticles, especially their drug loading capacity. In addition, carbohydrates are used as functionalization molecules on the surface of nanoparticles, but little is known about their toxicity and cellular uptake [92].\nRegarding the lower EE values for lipid nanoparticles, one of the liposomes' main drawbacks is the smaller drug delivery yield compared to other nanoparticles. Liposomes exhibit a lower EE than nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN). For instance, de Jesus et al. [93] compared the EE of mitoxantrone from 2\nTa bl e 1 N is in de liv er ed\nby di ffe re nt ty pe s of N an oD D S (N R = no tr ep or te d by\nth e au th or ).\nN an oD D S se ri es\nN an oD D S ty pe\nA ut ho r, Ye ar an d Re fe re nc e\nA pp lic at io n (m ic ro bi al te st ed )\nA ve ra ge D ia m et er (n m )\nζpo te nt ia l (m V)\nPD I\nN is in In co rp or at ed (μ g/ m L)\nEn tr ap m en t Effi ci en cy (% )\nD ru g re le as e\nM in im um\nIn hi bi to ry Co nc en tr at io n (μ g/ m L)\nEff ec tiv en es s of th e tr ea tm en t\nM et al lic\nN an op ar tic le s Si lv er\nN an op ar tic le s\nSa ra va na\nKu m ar i& A nn al ak sh m i, 20 12 [7 7]\nFo od\npr es er va tio n (S\nal m\non el la sp ., St ap hy lo co cc us sp ., Ba ci llu s sp ., Ps eu do m on as sp ., Es ch er ic hi a co li, En te ro co cc us sp .a nd Ca nd id a al bi ca ns )\nN R\nN R\nN R\nN R\nN R\nN R\nSt ap\nhy lo\nco cc\nus sp .\nan d\nBa ci\nllu s sp .–\n65 .2 5; Ps eu\ndo m\non as sp .,\nEs ch\ner ic\nhi a\nco li an d\nSa lm\non el\nla sp .–\n12 5;\nEn te\nro co\ncc us sp .a nd\nCa nd\nid a\nal bi\nca ns - 25 0\nSi gn ifi ca nt ly in cr ea se d ba ct er ia li nh ib iti on\nof ni si n ag ai ns ta ll sp ec ie s co m pa re d to fr ee ni si n\nG ol d N an op ar tic le s\nTh ir um\nur ug an et al ., 20 13 [7 8]\nFo od\npr es er va tio n\n(M ic\nro co\ncc us\nlu te\nru s,\nBa ci\nllu s\nce re\nus ,S\nta ph\nyl oc\noc cu\ns au\nre us , an d Es ch er ic hi a co li)\nN R\nN R\nN R\nN R\nN R\nN R\nN R\nSi gn ifi ca nt ly in hi bi te d bo th m ic ro bi al .F or M .l ut er us , ni si nlo ad ed go ld na no pa rt ic le s in cr ea se d th e ba ct er ia li nh ib iti on of ni si n.

The authors found a lower EE for the 2 liposome formulations (9.9% and 14.1%) compared to SLN (63.9%) and NLC (81.0%) formulations, despite adding the same amount of drug to all the nano-DDS. When comparing SLN and NLC, however, it appeared that the SLN (composed of Imwitor 900, Pluronic F68 and sodium deoxycholate) produced by Prombutara et al. [86] exhibited a higher EE (ranging from 69.2% to 73.6% of the drug load) than the NLC produced by Lewies et al. [90] (which ranged from 9.9% to 43.8% of the drug load). This is unexpected, since NLC were designed to increase SLN EE and prevent SLN from a burst of drug release. This is made possible by the addition of a lipid liquid at room temperature [94,95]. One possible explanation for this finding may be that the total amount of nisin loaded into these nanoparticles was different (i.e., a lower total amount of nisin was added to SLN than NLC), making it seem like NLC EE was lower than SLN.\nSome studies were not successful in developing efficient nano-DDS. For instance, Louvisse de Abreu et al. [88] showed that nisin-loaded polymeric nanoparticles (composed of Poly-ε-caprolactone and polyvinyl alcohol) used for candidiasis treatment were not significantly different from free nisin, even after 72 h of treatment. Although no explanation was presented for this finding, one possible reason might be related to the very delayed release of nisin; the authors indicated that nisin is released by diffusion and that only 20% of nisin is released from that specific polymeric nanoparticle into the media after 25 days. The low amounts of nisin released to the bulk solution over time was likely not enough to kill the candida sp. This failure suggests that the efficient delivery of nisin requires efficient degradation of the nanoparticle, so that the nisin can reach fungicidal concentrations.\nSimilarly, Lewies et al. [90] showed that nisin-loaded NLC had lower effectiveness than nisin alone against S aureus, S. epidermidis, and E. coli. Even in the presence of EDTA, nisin nano-DDS were not very effective against E. coli. Although the association of nisin and EDTA is used to control gram-negative bacteria [14,35–37], in this case, it barely changed the minimum inhibitory concentration. One possible explanation for this finding could that there is a lower nisin affinity for the bacterial membranes due to electrostatic interactions between nisin and NLC, since nisin is cationic at a neutral pH and both the membrane and the nanoparticle are negatively charged, thus, promoting a very low release of the bacteriocin into the media. This finding is in agreement with Louvisse de Abreu et al. [88], who demonstrated that a slightly negative polymeric nanoparticle decreased nisin affinity for the plasma membrane. However, a prolonged release profile might not be ideal for antimicrobial treatment as it could give rise to nisin-resistant microbes, as shown by Lewies; L. monocytogenes became resistant to nisin after 15 days of treatment.\nAnother consideration is that, the majority of studies regarding nisin delivery nano-DDS reported that their ζ-potential exhibited negative surface charge, and most bacteria also have negative net surface charges [96,97]. For instance, Gottenbos et al. [96] determined the surface charge (ξ) potential of some bacterial strains. S. aureus (strain ATCC12600) exhibited −10 mV of surface charge; −16 mV for E. coli (Strain O2K2) and − 7 mV for P. aeruginosa (strain AK2), whereas the nisin-loaded nano-DDS studies reported a ζ-potential between −1.96 mV and − 72.6 mV. This indicates a very high repulsive interaction between the bacterial surface and the nano-DDS. This repulsion would, in turn, precludes the membrane interactions and cellular uptake. Thus, limiting the potential for nano-DDS to act as a nisin reservoir and limit any possible antimicrobial synergistic effects between metal nano-DDS and bacteriocins [61] or the ability to escape from nisin resistance mechanisms [69]. Up to now, only 3 research articles reported positively charged nisin-loaded nano-DDS.

Among those with cationic nano-DDS, Cui et al., synthesized Poly-γ-Glutamic acid and Chitosan (γPGA-Chitosan) (Fig. 5). The nano-DDS structures demonstrated an increase in ζ-potential with increasing nisin concentrations, which correlated with an increase in nisin entrapment, reaching up to 5 mg/mL of nisin encapsulated inside of the nano-DDS. These nano-DDS significantly inhibited more L. monocytogenes in cheese than free nisin and for a longer period of time (up to 14 days, whereas free nisin inhibited the bacteria for only 4 days at 4 °C)."

      "text" : "Although nisin is the most studied bacteriocin in terms of nano-DDS (> 75% of the research articles), these carriers have also been used for delivering other bacteriocins. Interestingly, all studies focused on the use of bacteriocin-delivered nano-DDS for food preservation, except for one.\nIncorporation of bacteriocins in nano-DDS systems has improved several of the bacteriocin properties. For example, Thirumurugan et al. [78] collected a bacteriocin from Lactococcus plantarum isolated from slaughter house soil (likely a plantaricin) and it was loaded into gold nanoparticles, which increased bacterial inhibition compared to the free bacteriocin. Specifically, it inhibited Micrococcus luterus and Escherichia coli, but not for B. cereus, and S. aureus. The majority of the studies also show an increase in the half-life of the encapsulated bacteriocin, as their effect lasted longer than the free bacteriocin (up to 30 days, while free bacteriocin activity was up to 14 days at 4 °C). Similar to what was found for nisin, this effect could be explained by either protecting the bacteriocin from degradation and by the prolonged-release profile, leading to nano-DDS acting as a drug depot. Another example of prolonged-release was shown by Heunis et al. [115]. The authors demonstrated the release of only 32% of Plantaricin 432 and ST4SA load during the following 8 days after the initial burst releasee when delivered by nanofibers, composed of poly(D,L-lactide) and poly(ethylene oxide).\nHowever, the majority of these studies shows no significant difference regarding bacterial inhibition when compared to free bacteriocin. A possible explanation for this might be that the bacteriocins might be located on the surface of the nanoparticles, leading to faster delivery of the drug, resulting in similar outcomes as the free drug. An example of this is the study carried out by Heunis et al. [115] where they demonstrated that, by showing that 46% of Plantaricin 432 and/or ST4SA, led to a burst release from nanofibers up to 2 h of treatment.\nContrary to the majority of the studies that focused on food preservation, Mossallam et al. [116] focused on bacteriocin nano-DDS against the Enterocytozoon bieneusi, a sporous-producer intestinal pathogen that causes diarrhea. The authors found that encapsulating an unidentified bacteriocin produced by L. acidophilus into gold nanoparticles increased the bacteriocin effect, significantly reducing the number of intestinal spores of the pathogen when compared to the free bacteriocin in mice. In contrast to free bacteriocin, the encapsulated bacteriocin effect lasted even 1-week after the end of the treatment, demonstrating a potential -release of the bacteriocin in vivo.\nNext, we focus the discussion into specific bacteriocin delivered by Nano-DDS."

      "text" : "Pediocin PA-1 is a Class IIa bacteriocin, containing 44 amino acids with no post-translational modifications produced by the gram-positive Pediococcus sp. [117–119]. The FDA and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) regard the Pediococcus sp. as Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS); thus, the bacteriocin is used in meat preservation. Pediocin PA-1 exhibits a wide-spectrum of inhibition of gram-positive bacteria, and its mode of action is similar to that of nisin (i.e.,\nmembrane pore formation) [117,118]. As discussed before, gram-negative bacteria have a natural resistance to this mechanism of action due to the presence of the outer membrane [14,118]. Similar to nisin, gram-positive resistance to the bacteriocin has already been described in the literature, and is thought to be mediated by cell wall and lipid membrane modification mechanisms [117,118]. There are detailed reviews on pediocin PA-1 [118] and on Class IIa bacteriocins [117].\nTo circumvent these drawbacks, De Mello et al. [119] produced a Pediocin PA-1-loaded liposome mainly composed of phosphatidylcholine (average diameter of 186 nm, ζ-potential of −44.03 mV, and PDI of 0.237) for food preservation. Although the researchers were able to efficiently encapsulate the bacteriocin in the liposomes (80% of the bacteriocin load), no significant difference was found regarding the inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes by the nano-DDS formulation when compared to the free Pediocin PA-1 up to 24 days at 4 °C. This lack of a differential effect could potentially be explained by a higher affinity of the bacteriocin for the nanoparticle than the bacterial membrane, since the liposomal formulation had a very high anionic ζ-potential, and, thus, a very low potential release of the bacteriocin into the media and lower nanoparticle-cell interactions."

This review effort did not turn up any report about approval for the use of this bacteriocin or about its mode of action. However, several bacteria are sensitive to Plantaricin 432, such as Bacillus spp., Clostridium spp., Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Listeria spp., Pediococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Oenococcus oeni [115,120,121]. A high similarity between the plasmid containing Plantaricin 432 and Pediocin PA-1 have been reported [120,121]. Due to this similarity, it is possible that both bacteriocins have a similar mode of action (i.e., membrane pore formation).\nAlthough we were unable to find any report of plantaricin 432 resistant bacteria or resistance mechanism, van Reenen et al. [120] demonstrates that the bacteriocin is prone to enzymatic degradation by pepsin, papain, trypsin, alfa-chymotrypsin, and proteinase K.\nTo address this drawback, Heunis et al. [115,122] encapsulated Plantaricin 432 into Poly(D,L-lactide) and Polyethylene oxide nanofibers (Table 2). Although the authors demonstrated that the bacteriocinloaded nanofibers significantly inhibited Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus sakei, lower inhibition levels were found than for the free bacteriocin. This could indicate a high affinity of the bacteriocin for the nanofibers, and thus, a low release of the bacteriocin into the media. Surprisingly, the authors [122] also encapsulated the plantaricin 432- producing bacteria (L. plantarum 432) into nanofibers composed of polyethylene oxide, and they were able to regrow the bacteria in solid media and inhibit E. faecium. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed fibers containing bead-like structures, which likely represent the nanofibers with the entrapped bacteria, since the control fibers did not exhibit the same structure. However, the nanofiber production method (electrospinning) comes with a cost; it decreases L. plantarum 432 viability inside of the nanofibers by two orders of magnitude (from 2.3 × 1010 to 4.7 × 108 CFU/mL)."

Although enterocins have not been approved for commercial use, they can inhibit the growth of some gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococci spp. Bacillus spp., Clostridium spp., Listeria spp., and Staphylococcus spp. [5,123,124]. Among the enterocins, Enterocin FH-99 remained stable\nunder heat (100 °C for 10 min) and a wide range of pH values (from pH 2 to pH 10) [124]. Although we were unable to find any publications on enterocin FH-99 mode of action and resistance mechanisms,\nKaur et al. [125] demonstrated that the enterocin FH-99 mechanism of resistance is related to cell wall modification as well as cell aggregation in L. monocytogenes. Further, Kaur et al. [126] demonstrated that\npediocin 34-resistant L. monocytogenes had cross-resistance to enterocin FH-99, but not nisin. The authors suggest that this could be due to similar mechanisms of membrane binding and pore formation. This similarity underscores that pediocins and enterocins are categorized in the same class of bacteriocins; Class II bacteriocins.\nTo address these bacteriocin drawbacks, Sharma et al. [127] capped silver nanoparticles with 80 μg/mL of Enterocin FH-99 (average diameter of 325 nm, ζ-potential of −34.8 mV, no PDI and entrapment efficiency was reported) for food preservation, since silver nanoparticles also have antimicrobial potential. The authors demonstrated that enterocin FH-99-capping significantly increased silver nanoparticle mediated inhibition of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Shigella flexneri, and Streptococcus aureus by 2- to 16-fold. Interestingly, K. pneumonia, a gram-negative bacterium, had a higher minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to the enterocin-capped nanoparticles than the silver nanoparticles alone and an even higher MIC than other gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli. This might be due to the fact that K. pneumonia has several strategies for surviving inside of the human host. One of these strategies is the presence of a bacterial capsule that protects the bacterium from immune cell phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides, and complement-mediated lysis [128]."

Although the bacteriocin is heat stable (100 °C for 3 min) and stable over a wide-range of pH levels (from pH 3 to pH 10), Motta et al. [129] demonstrated that BLS P34 is prone to enzymatic degradation, by enzymes, including the pronase E enzyme mixture, trypsin, and lipase. We were unable to find any publications on the BLS P34 mode of action and resistance mechanisms.\nTo circumvent the enzymatic degradation drawback, Malheiros et al. produced a series of studies encapsulating BLS P34 in liposomes composed of soybean phosphatidylcholine [130,131] or soybean phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (7:3) [113] and tested their efficacy for treating L. monocytogenes in agar, milk and Minas Frescal cheese media. Although the authors were able to encapsulate 100% of the bacteriocin in the liposomes [113,131] and inhibit L. monocytogenes growth, the encapsulated bacteriocin inhibited significantly less bacteria than free BLS P34 for up to 4.5 h on agar media [130] and up to 8 days in both milk [131] and Minas Frescal cheese [113]. The liposomal formulation also showed a delayed onset, since the formulation inhibited the bacteria 2 h after the inoculation, whereas the free bacteriocin readily inhibited the bacterial growth in less than 0.5 h. This delayed onset might be indicative of a higher affinity of the bacteriocin for the liposomal formulation than the bacterial membrane; suggesting complete encapsulation efficiency (100%).\nInterestingly, for both milk [131] and Minas frescal cheese [113], encapsulated-BLS P34 inhibition was more efficient than free bacteriocin from day 8 up to day 21. This suggests that the prolonged-release effect of the liposomal formulation, increases the half-life and inhibitory effects of the bacteriocin in milk and Minas Frescal cheese."

Table 4 summarizes the finding for these unidentified bacteriocins.\nMossallam et al. [116] isolated a bacteriocin from Lactobacillus acidophilus strain CH1 collected from healthy breast-fed Egyptian infants. No further details were found about this bacteriocin. The authors encapsulated the bacteriocin in gold nanoparticles and tested them against Enterocytozoon bieneusi, a human intestinal pathogen. The bacteriocin-loaded gold nanoparticles significantly reduced intestinal E. bieneusi spore load when compared to the free bacteriocin. The formulation also was effective against the microbe even 1 week after the end of the therapy, demonstrating a potential prolonged-release effect of the nano-DDS.\nThirumurugan et al.

This bacteriocin seems to be heat-resistance (up to 121 °C for 15 min), yet prone to degradation by several proteases, such as, proteinase-K and lysozyme. The same group [78] encapsulated this bacteriocin in gold nanoparticles and tested the efficacy of these nanoparticles against Micrococcus luterus, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The bacteriocin-loaded gold nanoparticles significantly inhibited all microbes. The encapsulation increased the effectiveness of the bacteriocin against M. luterus and E. coli compared to free bacteriocin. However, it was not different from the free bacteriocin against B. cereus and S. aureus.\nBagde et al. [139] isolated another bacteriocin from gram-positive acetic acid cocci found in the black gram (Vigna mungo) identified as Enterococci faecium LMG11423(T) by 16S rRNA sequencing. The bacteriocin appeared to be similar to enterococci bacteriocin and was effective against L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, E. coli, E. herbicola, B. subtilis, B. cereus, and P. aeruginosa but not against P. notatum and A. niger. After producing a cellulose nanocrystal, the authors adsorbed the bacteriocin onto the nanoparticle by electrostatic interactions. The nano-DDS significantly inhibited the bacteria being tested, but inhibition was less than that of the free bacteriocin, thereby yielding a higher MIC for the nano-DDS compared to the free-bacteriocin. Although the authors gave no explanation, it is possible that physical absorption via electrostatic interactions can lead to higher bacteriocin-nanocrystal interactions compared to those at the site of bacteriocin action, thus decreasing bacteriocin activity."

      "heading" : "3. Challenges",
      "text" : "The first challenge with employing nano-DDS for delivering bacteriocins for therapeutic use is guaranteeing safety. As discussed before, there are still concerns about the safety of bacteriocin therapy. This can be addressed by demonstrating that bacteriocins are safer when associated with drug delivery systems. For example, these delivery systems can escape the innate immune response as a result of modifications to the physical-chemical parameters of bacteriocin-containing nano-DDS (such as size, charge, shape and surface ligands) [60] or by demonstrating that these delivery systems do not alter the behavior, or biochemical and histopathological features in vivo [116]. Among the studies identified for this review, only Mossallam et al. [116], Sharma et al. [127] and Heunis et al. [100] assessed the safety of their bacteriocin-loaded nano-DDS. Mossalam et al. [116] delivered their nano-DDS orally for 7 consecutive days in vivo before assessing histopathological and biochemical parameters. The authors found only marginal alterations in liver chemistry, and no significant alterations in body weight, clinical behavior, renal activity, or in the histopathology of spleen, intestine, liver, or kidney. The authors, thus, considered the formulation safe to use. Sharma et al. [127] tested the hemolytic potential of Enterocin-decorated silver nanoparticles and demonstrated no hemolytic effect on human blood up to 3 μg/mL. Heunis et al. [100], on the other hand, tested their nano-DDS on wound healing in vivo and found that their nisin-loaded nanofibers significantly accelerated wound healing compared to the gauze-only treatment. The histopathological analysis demonstrated significantly less inflammatory infiltration with the nisin-loaded fibers compared to the gauze-only treatment. However, none of these studies compared the bacteriocinloaded nano-DDS to the free bacteriocin. Thus, before reaching commercial shelves, additional studies are still needed to validate that bacteriocin-containing nano-DDS formulations can be safer than free bacteriocins.\nThe second challenge regarding the use of this new technology is guaranteeing in vivo efficacy; namely overcoming the issues regarding bacteriocin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Studies established that Nano-DDS can increase bacteriocin activity [75–79,81, 85–87,89,103,116,127,138] and stability [72,81–84,113,132].

As nanoparticle formulations are transformed into commercial products, certain manufacturing challenges arise and this limits their impact [140]. Among the manufacturing issues related to bacteriocin-loaded nano-DDS, we point out three current challenges to commercialization.\nI) The majority of nanoparticle production methods found expose bacteriocin peptides to procedures that could modify and/or damage bacteriocin structure and activity, thus, increasing the costs of production. These methods include exposure to organic solvents [72,75,76, 79,81–84,87,88,98–100,102–104,115], high voltage [98,101,103,122], shear stress caused by either sonication [88,90,105,106,110–114,119, 130,131] or mechanical homogenization [85,86,109], and temperatures above 40 °C [76,86,107–113,119,130,131]. Ideally, these methods should avoid damaging the peptide and limiting the loss of activity. For instance, Laridi et al. [89] address these issues by gently stirring (50–60 rpm) the liposomal lipids with the nisin solution for 15 min, then dilutes the mixture with water and stir again for another 15 min. However, this approach might lower the entrapment efficiency yield (9.5–33% EE from Laridi et al. vs. 11.5–100% EE from other liposomal methods). In contrast, Bagde et al. [139] adsorb the bacteriocin onto the nano-DDS after the nanoparticle is synthesized. However, this procedure might promote an early release of the bacteriocin, as it is adsorbed onto the surface of the nanoparticle and not entrapped inside.\nII) The issue of efficacy after incorporation is also a concern. Some studies demonstrated a lower or similar antimicrobial efficacy compared to the free bacteriocin. This is a complex issue and several parameters can affect the results. For instance, the majority of synthesis methods described expose bacteriocins to processes that could damage or decrease their activity, especially molecules on the surface of the nanoparticle. Except for those prepared by Lee et al. [79] and Alishahi et al. [87], all reported nanoparticles had a negative zeta potential. Although a negative zeta potential is thought to be necessary for a high encapsulation efficiency of bacteriocins, this could limit the interaction between the bacteriocin and the bacterial cell membrane. This, in turn, could, ultimately, decrease treatment efficacy, because of differences in the nanoparticle density and bacteriocin release patterns. Thus, the development of nano-DDS for bacteriocin therapy should focus on balancing the synthesis methods, encapsulation efficiency, release patterns and treatment efficacy.\nIII) There is the issue of nanoparticle consistency. One of the major safety concerns about nanoparticles are their inherent variability [141]. Baer et al. [142] states that several intrinsic and extrinsic phenomena affect nanoparticle synthesis, making them extremally dynamic and difficult to synthesize uniformly. These include the fact that nanoparticles are complex, the synthesis methods are not easily reproduced, and there are contaminants, and unstably produced particles. In this regard, nanoparticles can change as a function of time, handling, and specific synthesis methods, and environmental conditions. Thus, every nanoparticle must be considered as a product produced by a series specific processes, rather than a representative of a certain nanoparticle type and size [142,143]. Even though there is variability within each batch, size, format, surface functionalization molecules, and inner core/ shell are usually as uniform or consistent as expected within each batch [142]. For instance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of gold nanoparticles coated with silver demonstrated that the gold cores were often not in the center of the nanoparticle, the shape and size of the nanoparticles were not uniform and they dissolved at different rates in culture media [142,144]. However, no consistent problems were reported in the literature. For a further discussion of nanoparticles consistency, the reader is directed to another publication [142].\nThe fourth challenge regarding the use of this technology is the indiscriminate use of nanoparticles. The indiscriminate use of\nnanoparticles in recent years has contributed to an increase in safety concerns regarding nanotechnology devices, which have led to the creation of the nanotoxicology research field [145]. We recommend that each nano-DDS be tested for toxicity in vitro and in vivo before they move forward for testing for any particular application. For instance, Mendonça et al. [53] tested the in vivo toxicological profile of cationic SLN. Despite the transient inflammation in the reticuloendothelial cell–containing organs, this nanoparticle-DDS was considered safe for clinical use."

      "text" : "Despite the fact that bacteriocin nano-DDS still face some challenges, all the data presented in this review indicate that bacteriocin nano-DDS are a very promising research field. The studies demonstrate that Nano-DDS increase bacteriocin activity [75–79,81,85–87,89, 103,116,127,138] and stability [72,81–84,113,132]. This could mean that the nano-DDS is indeed delivering the bacteriocin directly to the site of action and/or is modulating the bacteriocin's physical-chemical properties, thus, increasing the antimicrobial potency of nisin [61].\nAlthough, most of the publications found in this work have focused on preventing food spoilage or for treating pathogenic microbes, bacteriocins, most prominently nisin, has been applied to other biomedical research fields, such as dentistry, and include applications for the treatment of caries [146], gingivitis and plaque [147], cancer [16,18], wound healing [100], as an immunomodulatory peptide for the activation of neutrophils [148], CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes, and for decreasing B-lymphocytes [149], and preventing biofilm formation and/ or disrupting pre-existent biofilms [69,102,114]. Thus, nisin research has opened the space for bacteriocin nano-DDS technology; allowing further work toward to improving bacteriocins so that they can reach the clinical settings and enhance in all these research fields.\nBiofilms are communities of cells attached to a common polymeric matrix in a sessile state (compared to their planktonic state), rendering different physical, chemical, and aerobic-conditions, and protection to those inside the community [150–154]. It has been estimated that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics necessary to eradicate a biofilm is 100 to 1000-times the MIC necessary to eradicate the planktonic cells [150]. Hence, the biofilm matrices has an important role in protecting bacteria from antibiotics by allowing them to evade antibiotic actions [43,69]. In this context, the use of bacteriocinassociated Nano-DDS would be very beneficial in potentially eradicating these biofilms. For instance, Ahire et al. [102] demonstrated that nisin incorporated into dihydroxybenzoic acid in polymeric nanofibers can significantly prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation. Niaz et al. [114] demonstrated that nisin-loaded rhamnosomes, liposomes composed of a special kind of lipid produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, acted as bio-surfactant and prevented the formation of pathogen biofilms and disrupted the biofilm biomass of 48 h preformed biofilms, while nisin alone was not able to prevent or disrupt those biofilms. To do so, the nano-DDS can be designed to interfere with biofilm integrity by interacting with the extracellular polymeric matrix and bacterial quorum sensing [69] and delivering the bacteriocin to disrupt and inhibit the biofilm.\nOur group is currently working on new applications of bacteriocins, specifically related to oral biofilms and cancer. Oral biofilms have been implicated in several diseases, including caries, periodontitis, implantitis, and even cancer. Specific pathogenic bacterial species have been linked to these diseases as a result of their ability to colonize the oral cavity and mediate dysbiosis. Among those, Treponema denticola is a member of the red complex of bacterial pathogens related to periodontal disease. Thus, disrupting oral biofilms and/or inhibiting the growth of specific periodontal pathogens, like T. denticola, by using bacteriocins may be an alternative treatment to periodontitis. Also, Kamarajan et al. [16] recently demonstrated that nisin reduces tumor size in vivo and extends the life span of tumor-bearing mice.\nPreliminary data from our workgroup shows a significant increase in nisin efficacy in disrupting oral biofilms, inhibiting the growth of periodontal pathogens, and reducing the viability of oral cancer cells when associated with a SLN formulation that was previously synthesized and optimized by our group for drug and gene delivery [50,53,93,155,156]. Thus, the association of bacteriocins with nanosized drug delivery systems can be used to expand the potential uses of bacteriocins by directing the bacteriocin to a specific target microbe or tissue.\nFor a further discussion on nisin's biomedical applications, the reader is directed to the publication by Shin et al. [15], whereas for a further discussion on the role of bacteriocins disrupting biofilms, the reader is directed to the publication by Mathur et al. [150].\nFinally, the use of nano-DDS for drug improvement is not only limited to bacterial AMPs. AMPs from other organisms, such as fungal and mammalian AMPs, also have great biological importance (e.g., antiviral, anti-insecticidal, or antiparasitic properties), which can be improved by the use of nano-DDS [41]. There is a database for all AMP discovered called the “Antimicrobial Peptide Database” (http://aps. unmc.edu/AP/main.php) [157,158] and, currently, this database holds more than 3100 discovered AMPs. Interestingly, most of the AMPs found in this database are from animals, such as amphibians, arthropods, and mammals. Among those AMPs, LL-37 is a human AMP expressed by several immune and epithelial cells and is directly involved in the host cellular response to microbial attacks [159]. LL-37 has anti-fungal, antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties [159,160], and can act as a chemoattractant for human peripheral blood neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells [161] and is even capable of inhibiting Kaposi's sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus [162]. However, LL-37 resistance mechanisms have already been documented, such be inactivation by aspartic proteases produced by Candida albicans or removal of the AMP out of the intracellular compartments [159]. In this regard, Nano-DDS can be useful by helping to prevent such resistance mechanisms and helping increase the half-life of LL-37 in the bloodstream during infections."

      "text" : "In summary, nano-DDS enhance bacteriocin effects, such antimicrobial activity, by prolonging their release, increasing their half-life, and effectively delivering the drug to a specific site of action. Despite these advances, bacteriocins still require pilot and clinical studies to demonstrate their effectiveness, not only in the food industry, but also in a clinical setting. New advances in bacteriocin delivery could promote better food security, but also new alternative treatments to chronic human diseases, such as periodontal disease, and deadly diseases, like cancer.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that the submitted work was not carried out in the presence of any personal, professional or financial relationships that could potentially be construed as a conflict of interest."
