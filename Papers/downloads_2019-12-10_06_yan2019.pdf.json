Compared with traditional vaccines, novel vaccines have better stability, longer duration and require less antigen usage. In addition, novel vaccines have better immune effects and significantly less toxic side effects. However, both novel vaccines and traditional vaccines require carrier molecules or adjuvants to produce an optimal immune response. There is an increasing demand for vaccine adjuvants and delivery systems that can induce stronger immune response whilst reducing production cost and the dose of vaccine. In recent years, nanotechnology has played an important role in the development of novel vaccine adjuvants and nano-delivery systems. Biodegradable materials have also received a lot of attention in medical science because they have excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability and low toxicity, which can protect antigens from degradation, increase antigen stability and provide slow release; resulting in enhanced immunogenicity. Therefore, biodegradable nanoparticles have attracted much attention in the formulation of vaccines. In this review, we outline some key features of biodegradable nanomaterials in the developing safer and more effective vaccines. The properties, structural characteristics, advantages and disadvantage of the biodegradable nanomaterials will be systematically reviewed. Additionally, applications, research progress and future prospects of biodegradable nanomaterials are discussed. This review will be help in future research work directed at developing biodegradable vaccine adjuvants or delivery carriers.\n2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nAmong the various health interventions, vaccination is undoubtedly one of the most successful method and continues to have a huge impact on the prevention of deaths caused by global infectious diseases [1]. Currently, human and animal vaccines are mainly divided into three categories, namely, 1) Live attenuated vaccine: the vaccine consists of viruses or bacterium, but the pathogenicity of the pathogen is lower than the wild type pathogen; 2) Inactivated vaccine: the vaccine comprises pathogens that have been inactivated through thermal or chemical means; and 3) Subunit vaccine: the vaccine is made from the components of the pathogens, because subunit vaccine are safer than live attenuated\nand inactivated vaccines [2]. However, subunit vaccine faces some difficulties, such as insufficient immune response or poor efficacy. On the other hand, live attenuated vaccines are limited by the fact that incomplete inactivation of bacteria or viruses may result in high morbidity after vaccination, and may also cause virulence recovery [3]. Nowadays, although many novel vaccines have been developed, but the immunogenicity of these vaccines tend to be weakened [4]. Additionally, these novel vaccines have some other drawbacks. For example, when DNA vaccines are administered via intramuscular injection, the vaccines are unable to reach the antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The weak immune responses and low expression levels of the DNA vaccine are critical factors that prevent their application in large animals [5].\nAdjuvants are entities incorporated into vaccines to increase the immunogenic responses of antigens. They play a crucial role in increasing the potency and efficacy of vaccines [6]. Vaccine delivery systems can deliver the antigen to phagocytic cells or dendritic cells to increase the utilization of the antigen, and also sustain release of the antigen [7]. Vaccine adjuvant and delivery systems\noi.org/\nare essential ingredients of vaccines as they determine the immune response and production costs of vaccines. Recently, nanotechnology has played an important role in the development of new vaccine adjuvants and new nano delivery systems. Similarly, biodegradable materials which do not only have useful intrinsic properties (including immunomodulation, biocompatibility, and biodegradability), but also have the capacity to protect antigens from degradation; enhance immunogenicity and stability of antigens; and are less toxic; have gained recognition as ideal materials for use as vaccine adjuvant.\nNanoparticles made of biodegradable materials attracts widespread attention in vaccine research, and have become the main direction for the development of novel vaccine adjuvants and delivery systems [8,9]. The particle size of the nanoparticles generally ranges from 25 to 200 nm. These nanoparticles exhibit potent immune enhancement in vivo and are capable of inducing violent humoral, cellular and mucosal immune responses. Nanoparticles can also enhance targeted antigen presentation to cells and/or slowly release its associated antigen, and therefore can act as a delivery vehicle for the antigen or as an adjuvant itself. To date, many nanoparticle-based vaccines have been used in clinical or pre-clinical trials, and the results have been encouraging as intervention measures for pressing infectious disease threats as malaria, influenza, Ebola and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [10– 12].\nIn the review, based on the application potential of biodegradable nanomaterials in vaccines as highlighted above, this review seeks to summarize the properties, structural characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of some of these biodegradable nanomaterials, and also discuss research progress and application prospects of these biodegradable nanomaterials in vaccine manufacture.\n2. Biodegradable materials\nBiodegradable materials are mainly divided into two categories according to their acquisition methods: natural biodegradable materials and synthetic biodegradable materials (Table 1).\nPoly(lactic-coglycolic acid) Lactic acid and glycolic acid polymerization Loading multiple antig modulators, used in m throughout the body [ Polyanhydride Synthesis of methyl vinyl ether and maleic hydride Sustained release and for drug delivery [28] Micelles Amphiphilic synthesis [30] Hydrophobic core tha drugs [30] Poly-L-lysine dendrigraft\nLysine polycondensation synthesis [31]\nLow toxicity, targeted\nPlease cite this article as: X. Yan, M. Zhou, S. Yu et al., An overview of biodegra 10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.11.031\nNanoparticle carriers made of biodegradable nanomaterials can enhance the immunogenicity of vaccine [13,14]. Simultaneously, the nanoparticle-loaded vaccine can also sustain release, thereby, improving the immune effect of vaccine.\n2.1. Natural biodegradable materials\nNatural biodegradable materials are mainly extracted from plants and animals, and are therefore less toxic, biocompatible and biodegradable. However, because these materials are natural and biodegradable materials, they easily cause immune rejection in the body. In addition, lack of mechanical strength, poor ductility, and poor water solubility limit the application of natural biodegradable materials. Therefore, it is necessary to modify the polymerization or blending of natural biomaterials through physical or chemical methods to obtain more the valuable biodegradable materials.\n2.1.1. Chitosan Chitosan (Chemical structural formula is shown in Fig. 1) is a natural biopolymer, which has shown great promise as a hemostatic agent, immunological adjuvant, drug delivery vehicle in regeneration, tissue scaffold and many other medical applications [33,34]. Chitosan is biocompatible, biologically derived, biodegradable, immunostimulatory, mucoadhesive, non-toxic, blood compatible, anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, antibacterial material, it is cheap and easy to obtain [26]. Due to its unique properties, chitosan is widely used in medicine, food, chemical, cosmetics, water treatment, metal extraction and recycling, biochemistry, biomedical engineering and other fields. However, chitosan is difficult to dissolve in water and is only soluble in acidic solutions, so the low water-solubility limits its application [35].\n2.1.2. Hyaluronic acid Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a natural bio-adhesive polymer found in the vertebrates, connective tissues, and synovial and extracellular tissue matrices of the eyes of vertebrates [17,18]. The chemical structural formula of HA is shown in Fig. 1. It is a high molecular weight hyaluronic acid and composed of two disaccharide units,\niew.\nens and immune ucous membranes and 27]\nAn organic solvent is required; not very stable; usually mucosal administration is ineffective\nsurface erosion properties Highly sensitive to hydrolysis; limited application [29]\nt can load non-hydrophilic Poor stability; not mass produced [30]\n[31] Preparation requires complex coupling processes, and immunogenicity may interfere with booster immunity [32]\ndable nanomaterials and applications in vaccines, Vaccine, https://doi.org/\nFig. 1. The chemical structure of chitosan, hyaluronic acid, liposome and sodium alginate.\nD-glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine [36,37]. Its natural biological effects depend much on the length of the polysaccharide [38]. HA has a unique molecular structure and physical and chemical properties, showing a variety of important physiological functions, such as tissue development, skin protection, natural lubricant, regulating the diffusion of water and electrolytes, maintaining blood vessel elasticity and promoting wound healing. In addition, HA is also biocompatible and biodegradable, therefore, it is an important component of many nano drug delivery systems [19].\n2.1.3. Liposome Lipid is a biomolecule with a hydrophilic group at the head and a hydrophobic group at the tail, and can self-assemble in water and form liposome. The structure of liposome involves a hydrophilic inner membrane and a hydrophobic outer membrane under normal condition (Fig. 1) [39]. This structural feature allow liposome to encapsulate multiple drugs and control drug delivery [40]. Liposome has significant clinical potential because of its biocompatibility and stability in vivo [41]. Liposomes can load hydrophilic drugs or substances into their inner core while loading hydrophobic drugs or substances into their membranes [42]. Liposomes can be modified to obtain desired immunostimulatory properties, which is a unique advantage over other carriers. A novel nano vaccine system was developed by modulating liposome, which exhibited lectin-bound mannose to capture monophosphoryl lipid A adjuvants on their surface. This system is capable of targeting dendritic cells and promoting T lymphocyte against model antigen presentation [43]. Furthermore, there are many administration routes for liposomes, including oral, intravenous, subcutaneous and topical administration [44].\n2.1.4. Sodium alginate Sodium alginate is a sodium salt of alginic acid, a naturally occurring polysaccharide existing in brown algae, bubble leaf algae and giant algae. Sodium alginate is a natural biodegradable\nPlease cite this article as: X. Yan, M. Zhou, S. Yu et al., An overview of biodegra 10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.11.031\nmucoadsorbent polysaccharide that does not cause toxicity after administration [45,46]. The chemical structural formula of sodium alginate is shown in Fig. 1. Alginate nanoparticles as a hydrophilic carrier can prolong the release period of antigen, and enhance the immunogenicity of antigen due to their adjuvant properties. In addition, due to the muco-adhesiveness and permeability, alginate nanoparticles can reduce the degradation of drugs in acidic environment during nasal and oral administration. Moreover, no aggregation of alginate particles was observed in major organs. Several studies have revealed the superiority of alginate-based nanoparticles to be depended on the size of the particles [47,48]. Compared with the microparticles, the nanoparticles have the advantages of improving drug encapsulation, pharmacokinetics, bioavailability and therapeutic effects. Alginate nanoparticles can be easily prepared by divalent cation induced gelation [49,50].\n2.2. Synthetic biodegradable materials\nMost of the synthetic biodegradable materials are high molecular weight polymers, which have ester structure. These materials are synthesized through the introduction of molecules and polymers into the ester structure through molecular condensation or polymerization. More mature ones are chitosan derivatives, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polyanhydride, micelles, poly-Llysine dendrigraft (DGL), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), etc. These materials have good mechanical properties and are easily controlled by chemical or physical modification.\n2.2.1. Chitosan derivatives Due to the defects in the performance of chitosan itself, researchers performed different modification on chitosan according to their requirements, such as: hydrophobic modification, hydrophilic modification, M-cell targeting modification, and specific ligand modification [51]. Chitosan has hydroxyl group and amino group, therefore, chemical modifications, such as, hydroxylation, carboxylation, alkylation, acylation, quaternization, esterifi-\ndable nanomaterials and applications in vaccines, Vaccine, https://doi.org/\nFig. 2. The chemical structure of chitosan derivatives hydroxypropyl chitosan, carboxymethyl chitosan, N-alkyl chitosan; N-succinic acid chitosan, N-2-Hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan, sulfate chitosan and hydroxyethyl chitosan.\ncation and etherification can be performed on chitosan [24,25]. Chemical structural formula of chitosan derivatives is shown in Fig. 2. Modification does not alter the basic skeleton of chitosan, but will result in new or improved performance of derivatives. These derivatives can increase the permeation of drugs, especially the hydrophilic macromolecules, improved colon targeting and protect acid-sensitive drugs. These derivatives can also promote the release of drugs under alkaline environment, and overcome the problem of water- solubility of chitosan [52–54].\n2.2.2. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is a polyester that is nontoxic (chemical structural formula is shown in Fig. 3). It has been proven that PLGA nanoparticles are biodegradable and can stimulate immune responses [55]. PLGA nanoparticles were used for intranasal inoculation of pigs, leading to improve the humoral and cellular immune responses [56]. PLGA nanoparticles combined with lipid monolayers could promote slow release of antigens [57].\n2.2.3. Polyanhydride Polyanhydride is a synthetic, biodegradable, non-toxic, biocompatible polymer with sustained release and surface erosion properties (Fig. 3) [28]. They are potential materials as carriers for delivering vaccine or drug, because they can effectively regulate the release of active proteins in vivo [28]. The surface protein of Pneumococcal was encapsulated with 1,6-bis-(p-carboxyphenoxy) hexane (CPH):sebacic acid (SA) (20:80) and 1,8-bis-(p-carboxyphe noxy)-3,6-dioxaoctane (CPTEG):CPH (50:50) nanoparticles to immunize mice. The results showed that mixed protein induce strong immune response compared to the control group [58]. Nanoparticles for delivering alpha-gal modified antigens were also prepared using CPTEG:CPH (50:50), which released the antigen slowly from the carrier and induced a strong CD4+ T lymphocyte reaction [59]. The specific antigen uptake processing pathway of polyanhydride nanoparticles is unclear, but the mechanism of\nPlease cite this article as: X. Yan, M. Zhou, S. Yu et al., An overview of biodegra 10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.11.031\nactivity of polyanhydride nanoparticles is due to the active uptake of polyanhydride nanoparticles by dendritic cells [60].\n2.2.4. Micelles The formation of micelles is due to the self-assembly of hydrophobic parts when a large number of amphiphilic molecules attract each other in water. The inside is a hydrophobic core and the surface is a hydrophilic layer formed of a hydrophilic portion [61]. Structure of the micelle is shown in Fig. 3. Poorly watersoluble drugs or amphiphilic substances are usually encapsulated and delivered using micelles [62]. Unlike liposomes, micelles have only a monolayer of phospholipids or other amphiphilic monomers or polymers, and the inner core is a hydrophobic core [63,64]. There are many molecules that can be used to synthesize micelles. Most amphiphilic molecules with polar/hydrophilic groups and non-polar/hydrophobic groups can be used for synthesis. Surfactants and/or co-surfactants are usually used to prepare micelles [65]. Micelles can increase the water solubility and bioavailability of loaded drugs or substances, reduce adverse effects, enhance their permeability to physiological barriers, and alter their distribution in vivo [63].\n2.2.5. Poly-L-lysine dendrigraft Poly-L-lysine dendrigraft (DGL) is formed by the polycondensation of lysine and is a water-soluble polycationic dendrigraft based on poly-L-lysine (PLL) [66]. DGL has a linear core and a more flexible structure than dendrigrafts [67]. DGL is biodegradable, monodispersable and biofilm permeable, and can be combined with anionic materials by electrostatic forces [32]. Structure of DGL is shown in Fig. 3. The amino acid produced after DGL degradation is less toxic. Its molecular surface has a high density of amino molecular groups, and the complex molecular structure has more group modifications. Under physiological conditions, the shape of high-generation DGL is generally spherical and have a positive charge [68,69]. DGL and its deuterated derivatives have been studied on liposomes and cell membranes, and the results\ndable nanomaterials and applications in vaccines, Vaccine, https://doi.org/\nFig. 3. The chemical structure of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), polyanhydride, micelles and poly-L-lysine dendrigraft.\nindicated that DGL is a potential material for drug delivery systems or gene delivery applications [70–75].\n3. Applications of biodegradable nanomaterials in vaccines\n3.1. Applications of natural biodegradable nanomaterials\n3.1.1. Chitosan nanoparticles Many studies have demonstrated that chitosan nanoparticles are very promising vaccine delivery vehicles. Chitosan nanoparticles loaded with the plasmid DNA of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) F gene were constructed and used to immunize chickens. Chickens immunized with the nanoparticles had improved immune response by mucosal vaccination and the release of plasmid DNA was prolonged [76]. Chitosan nanoparticles encapsulating plasmid DNA encoding Schistosoma mansoni Rho1-GTPase protein were prepared, and the nanoparticles showed great stability, targeted accessibility and immunostimulatory properties after oral immunization. These nanoparticles also triggered a stronger regulation of cytokine IL-10 levels and a protective effect against Schistosomiasis parasite infection [77]. It has been reported that chitosan nanofiber membranes (NFs) are potential materials for use in nasal delivery systems for Shigella vaccine. Guinea pigs after intranasal immunization with N-IpaD/NFs showed stronger cellular and mucosal immune responses compared with other test groups [78]. Studies have shown that chitosan nanocapsule vaccine encapsulated with imiquimod containing TLR7 agonist can produce considerable protective immune response against hepatitis B after intranasal vaccination. After inoculation, chitosan nanocapsule vaccine can produce high-levels of IgG1 and IgG2a subclass antibodies, stable cellular and humoral immune response, and long-term specific immune memory [79].\n3.1.2. Hyaluronic acid nanoparticles Hyaluronic acid (HA) has been widely used in many nano drug delivery systems as an important component. A hyaluronic acidbased bio-adhesive vaccine delivery system loaded with LKT63 influenza antigen has been successfully developed and found to\nPlease cite this article as: X. Yan, M. Zhou, S. Yu et al., An overview of biodegra 10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.11.031\nproduce a substantial immune response against antigen after intranasal immunization [80]. Verheula et al. prepared trimethyl chitosan (TMC)-HA nanoparticles and loaded the model antigen with ovalbumin (OVA), the OVA-loaded TMC-S-S-HA nanoparticles had better immunogenicity after intranasal and intradermal immunization compared to unstable particles indicated by higher IgG titers [81].\n3.1.3. Liposome nanoparticles Liposome nanoparticle is one of the most potential colloidal drug delivery systems, which combine the advantages of bilayer vesicles, polymer nanoparticles and emulsions. Solid liposome nanoparticles (SLN) provide considerable stability, protection against embedded biologically active substances, low toxicity, compatibility and ideal release characteristics of biologically active substances. The cytotoxicity of the cysteine protease genecontaining SLN prepared from cationic lipids was determined on COS-7 cells, and the results showed that SLN containing cysteine protease gene has no obvious cytotoxicity [82]. SLN was used as a delivery system to deliver type I cysteine protease intraperitoneally as vaccine for primary infection of Leishmania, and the results showed that the levels of IFN-c and IgG2a in immunized mice increased, IL-4 was produced, while the number of parasites in vivo decreased, indicating that Th1 immune response was enhanced after vaccination [83]. Additionally, the team also studied the immunological results of cationic SLN containing plasmid DNAs of type I, II and III cysteine proteases, and the results showed that SLN could elicit an immune response against Leishmaniasis in an ideal manner [84].\n3.1.4. Sodium alginate nanoparticles Sodium alginate (SA) is a natural, non-irritating, non-toxic, biodegradable mucoadhesive polymer, which makes it a suitable polymer for vaccine development [85]. Lee prepared chitosan/alginate nanoparticles for encapsulation of bee venom (CH/AL-BV). The results showed that the CH/AL-BV could promote systemic immune response, and help the clearance of respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [86]. e-PL-SA nanoparticles (PSNPs) were prepared by using the ion-ligation self-assembly e-polylysine (e-PL) and\ndable nanomaterials and applications in vaccines, Vaccine, https://doi.org/\nSA. PSNPs encapsulated the model antigen, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and the results showed that BSA could be slowly released in the PSNPs, and the nanoparticles didn’t show cytotoxicity [87].\n3.2. Applications of synthetic biodegradable nanomaterials\n3.2.1. Chitosan derivatives nanoparticles Numerous studies have demonstrated that chitosan derived nanoparticles can serve as potential candidates for vaccine adjuvants and delivery systems [76,88]. It has been reported that glucomannan-modified chitosan nanoparticles have been prepared for oral delivery systems and the performance of nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo has been evaluated. The results showed that the nanoparticles significantly elicited higher systemic, mucosal and cell-mediated immune response [89]. Mannosylated chitosan (MCS/pGRP) nanoparticles containing anti-GRP DNA was administered intranasally to mice afflicted with prostate cancer and evaluated for anti-tumor efficacy. The results showed that the mice immunized with the MCS/pGRP nanoparticles induced higher antibody titers and effective antitumor activities, and that the nanoparticles could be used as vector for anti-tumor immunotherapy [90]. Sharma prepared chitosan-dextran sulfate (CS-DS) nanoparticles modified by IgA antibody, and in vivo experiments showed that IgA-modified CS-DS nanoparticles were preferentially taken up by mouse nasal mucosa or M cells after intranasal vaccination [91]. Zhao et al. prepared N-2-Hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan (N-2-HACC) and N, Ocarboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) nanoparticles, and the nanoparticles served as adjuvant and delivery carrier for infectious bronchitis virus vaccine and Newcastle disease virus vaccine. The immune response in chickens suggested that the nanoparticles were beneficial to inoculate IgG and sIgA antibodies intranasally and also to enhance lymphocyte proliferation [92]. Subsequently, Zhao et al. prepared the N-2-HACC/CMCS nanoparticles as carrier for the mucosal delivery of the plasmid DNA of NDV F gene, and found that not only high sIgA antibodies were produced, but also lymphocyte proliferation was significantly stimulated, and also the secretion levels of IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-c was increased [5].\n3.2.2. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles PLGA nanoparticles have been used for carrying antigens for a variety of pathogens including hepatitis B virus, tetanus toxin, Plasmodium vivax and Bacillus anthracis, by surface conjugation or internal encapsulation [12,93–95]. PLGA-based delivery system has been associated with model antigens represented by ovalbumin to enhance immunity [96]. At the same time, adjuvants have also been encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticle or linked to PLGA polymer backbone to enhance immune response while performing controlled delivery [97–100]. PLGA/PLA-based nanoparticles can delay the release time of encapsulated antigens and allow the antigens to be targeted to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in a controlled and sustained manner. These results also fully demonstrate that PLGA is an important mucosal adjuvant that can induce cellular and humoral immune responses [101,102]. Prolonging the period of antigen release, providing a substantial immune response, avoiding the risk of tolerance, and reducing the frequency of intensive treatments allows PLGA-based nanoparticles to be used in defensive immunization [96]. Zhao et al. encapsulated swine influenza DNA vaccine with PLGA as a biodegradable matrix. The results indicated that the PLGA microspheres achieved long-term release of plasmid DNA [103]. Subsequently, Zhao et al. used the double emulsion solvent evaporation method to prepare the Newcastle disease virus F gene DNA vaccine encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticles and the nanoparticles induced stronger humoral, cellular and mucosal immune responses, and also achieved sustained release of antigen [104].\nPlease cite this article as: X. Yan, M. Zhou, S. Yu et al., An overview of biodegra 10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.11.031\n3.2.3. Polyanhydride nanoparticles The amphiphilic polyanhydride nanoparticles has pathogenic mimetic properties and the ability to trigger dendritic cells. Due to their hydrophobicity, polyanhydride nanoparticles exhibit maximum release and internalization of cytokines by dendritic cells. Amphiphilic polyanhydride nanoparticles exhibit greater ability in protecting the functional integrity of the antigen. The versatility and superiority of amphiphilic nanoparticles as long-term storage vaccine delivery carriers have been proven in previous studies [105,106]. Compared with the BALB/c mice immunized with uncoated nanoparticles, mice orally immunized with mannosamine or flagellin surface-coated bio-adhesive polyanhydride nanoparticles received a more sustained and stable humoral, cellular and mucosal immune response and produced high levels of G1 and IgG2a [107–109].\n3.2.4. Micelles nanoparticles As vaccine delivery system, micelles have been implemented in two common ways. First, by covalent attachment, hydrophilic micelle corona can easily be linked to a protein vaccine. This method is used in adjuvant-loaded polymer-based micelles to link HIV vaccines, which can produce strong APCs activation in vitro [110]. A similar method has been used to attach model peptide antigen to a lipid micelle polymer loaded with adjuvant, and the results showed that it can preferentially bind albumin and flow to lymph nodes, which greatly enhances the probability of triggering T cells and also play an important role as anti-cancer vaccine [111]. Alternatively, a hydrophilic peptide vaccine can be attached to the hydrophobic portion of surfactant to synthesize peptide amphiphiles. The hydrophobic portion of the surfactant will selfassemble in water to form micelles. Since antigen is used as a component of nanoparticles, the effective antigen loading of amphiphilic peptide micelles can reach 90% by weight [112]. Studies have found that amphiphilic peptide micelles can effectively exert bactericidal effects in the test of Streptococcus pyogenes mice, and without adjuvant assistance, peptide amphiphile micelles containing a cytotoxic T cell epitope promote a protective immune response in vivo [113,114].\n3.2.5. Poly-L-lysine dendrigraft nanoparticles DGL as a delivery vehicle can effectively bind drugs or gene fragments, and has the tendency to exist in the body for a long time, thereby achieving long-term release [72,115,116]. Studies have proved that DGL has dual gene targeting delivery potential and can efficiently transport gene fragments across the bloodbrain barrier [117]. According to research reported, the first nonviral gene vector used for cancer intervention was polyethylene glycol DGL. It can effectively bind to plasmid DNA, express proteins efficiently, and significantly inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro [118]. The researchers used pH sensitive imine bond to load metformin (MET) and doxorubicin (DOX) onto RGD-DGL-GNP nanoparticles (RDG NPs) for therapy, the results showed that coadministration of RDDG NPs and RMDG NPs improved the therapeutic effect on the xenograft tumor model, breast cancer, colon cancer cell and lung metastasis models [119]. A gene vector consisting of DGL has been developed, and the vector exhibits low cytotoxicity and do not induce red blood cell agglutination at high doses. After intravenous administration to mice, DGL6 complex showed high transfection efficiency in liver, lung and spleen [118].\n4. Future prospects\nBiodegradable materials have inherent immune regulation, biocompatibility, biodegradability, mucosal adhesion, nonimmunogenicity, low toxicity and safety characteristics. Mucosal\ndable nanomaterials and applications in vaccines, Vaccine, https://doi.org/\nimmunity has many advantages. But, due to the enzyme and acid environment of the body, the degradation of antigen leads to a decrease or even loss of the immunogenicity of vaccines, and therefore hinders the development of mucosal immunity. In order to address the problems of mucosal immunity, it is required for suitable delivery vehicles that protect the antigen from degradation in vivo. The continuous innovation of biodegradable nanomaterials and the advances in nanotechnology has made this possible. Nanoparticles synthesized from biodegradable materials can serve as both vaccine adjuvant and vaccine delivery system. Biodegradable nanoparticles can protect drugs or antigens from destruction by the acidic environment and enzymes that exist in the body. Secondly, these biodegradable nanoparticles are able to deliver drugs or antigens to a given location, which provides an opportunity for mucosal immunity. However, the use of biodegradable nanoparticles in mucosal immunization vaccine delivery is still in its early stages, and there are still many challenges. Therefore, it is becoming more and more important to rationally design and combine reproducible production of nanoparticles with desired properties, functions and efficiencies in future.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\nAcknowledgements\nWe gratefully acknowledge the Heilongjiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Genetic Engineering and Biological Fermentation Engineering for Cold Region to carry out this work.

    "abstractText" : "Vaccination is the most cost-effective and sustainable way to prevent and eliminate infectious diseases. Compared with traditional vaccines, novel vaccines have better stability, longer duration and require less antigen usage. In addition, novel vaccines have better immune effects and significantly less toxic side effects. However, both novel vaccines and traditional vaccines require carrier molecules or adjuvants to produce an optimal immune response. There is an increasing demand for vaccine adjuvants and delivery systems that can induce stronger immune response whilst reducing production cost and the dose of vaccine. In recent years, nanotechnology has played an important role in the development of novel vaccine adjuvants and nano-delivery systems. Biodegradable materials have also received a lot of attention in medical science because they have excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability and low toxicity, which can protect antigens from degradation, increase antigen stability and provide slow release; resulting in enhanced immunogenicity. Therefore, biodegradable nanoparticles have attracted much attention in the formulation of vaccines. In this review, we outline some key features of biodegradable nanomaterials in the developing safer and more effective vaccines. The properties, structural characteristics, advantages and disadvantage of the biodegradable nanomaterials will be systematically reviewed. Additionally, applications, research progress and future prospects of biodegradable nanomaterials are discussed. This review will be help in future research work directed at developing biodegradable vaccine adjuvants or delivery carriers. 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
