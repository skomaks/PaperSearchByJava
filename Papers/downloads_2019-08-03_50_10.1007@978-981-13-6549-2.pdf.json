They are most often considered as a subset of MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and called bioMEMS even when they do not include mechanical micro or nanotructures because they often share similar technological processes. They are usually designated as micro total analysis systems (µTAS) when they include all steps required to perform biological sample collection and its chemical or biochemical analysis as usually done in a laboratory. A lab-on-chip (LoC) is an highly integrated version on a single chip of a µTAS function or of a whole µTAS.\nFrom the end of seventies up to the beginning of nineties integrated sensing systems were mainly based on microactuators and on microsensors of physical quantities (pressure, acceleration, magnetic field, temperature,…). They were typically fabricated by processes coming from microelectronics completed by dedicated bulk and surface micromachining of silicon or Silicon-On Insulator (SOI) wafers and eventual assembly with a glass wafer. Since about 1990, these integrated sensing systems were designated as MEMS and this denomination is now commonly used for all kind of miniaturized sensing and/or actuation systems. Later on, at the end of nineties, optical functions and/or components were added to build optical MEMS and Micro OptoElectroMechanical Systems (MOEMS). Finally at the beginnning of 21st century, nanostructures and nanomaterials began to be integrated‚ and NanoElectromechanical Systems (NEMS) were born.\nA.

(eds.), Engineering of Micro/Nano Biosystems, Microtechnology and MEMS, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-6549-2_1\n1\nNowadays, MNOEMS have reached a high level of sophistication and maturity and are fabricated by using a large variety of materials and processes and mobile communication devices such as cell phones enjoy MEMS technology for radio frequency signal reception and transmission. MNOEMS represent 80% of the industrial market of sensing and actuating miniaturized systems with an annual growth rate larger than 10% for 10 years.\nMicrofluidic devices in glass technology and labs-on-chip appeared later than physical microsensors but with a rapid growth since the beginning of nineties. Since, a very broad range of specific fabrication technologies largely based on polymers, and of various sensing principles were developped. BioMEMS have a wide variety of applications for biology, medicine and agriculture. In 2000, microfluidics systems and bioMEMS represented only a few % of the MEMS industrial market but it is now more than 20% and a compound annual growth rate of 25% is predicted up to 2023. Nevertheless, µTAS and labs-on-chips still represent a small fraction of this market and the challenge is to overcome the commercialization, ethic and legal barriers to benefit of the high potential of these bioMEMS.\nThe size of biological objects is ranging from a few nm to a few hundreds of µm (Fig. 1.1). So a basic requirement of bioMEMS is the ability to handle and detect objects at micro/nanoscale: manipulation methods to separate, concentrate, filtrate, and identify cells, proteins, viruses and DNA using electrophoresis, electroosmosis, and electrowetting. This is notably achieved by integrating biosensors as depicted in Fig. 1.2, A biosensor typically includes a microfluidic system with micro/nano channels, pumps, valves, filters and electrodes to transport, concentrate, separate, mix, localize,… the biological objects or micro/nano particles carrying them. It also usually includes biofunctionnalized surfaces or traps to capture targeted species with a high selectivity. Detection is often performed in research works by optical microscopy or by other external means but to benefit from the full potential of bioMEMS, miniaturized transducers or indicators should be integrated to detect captured species and to convert the result into an electrical or optical signal, or to a specific color. As detailed in the different chapters of this book, various electrical, optical, mechanical, magnetical and coupled phenomena can be used for fluids and bio species handling and detection at micro/nanoscale.\nProkariote Cells\nEukariote Cells\nDNA Diameter\n2 A. Bosseboeuf and K. Chun\nOwing to micro/nano fabrication technologies, bioMEMs integrating biosensors like in Fig. 1.2 can be highly miniaturized and fabricated at low cost by batch processing on various substrates (glass, silicon, polymers). This offers the possibility to get disposable systems that avoid maintenance operations like cleaning, purge, calibration, etc…and reduces the need of trained staff for their operation. BioMEMS have also many other proven or potential benefits when compared to conventional systems [1–25]:\n– BioMEMS have the ability to handle small amounts of expensive chemical or pharmaceutical products and are sufficiently sensitive to detect small concentration of biological objects. This contributes to cost reduction and faster biochemical analyses but also reduces waste generation and minimize exposure to hazardous products. For human diagnostics, it reduces, for example, the amount of critical corporal liquids like blood that must be collected. For fundamental research, it also allowed, for the first time, operations at the single cell level. – BioMEMS can allow faster measurements than with conventional systems because diffusion of chemicals, flow switching and diffusion of heat are faster at micro/nano scale. Eventually faster measurements can provide real-time process control and monitoring. As an example, integration of Polymerase Chain reaction (PCR) in a lab-on-chip allows a ten times faster DNA amplification. – BioMEMS are able to integrate a large number of fluidics and biochemical functions on a single system and to perform parallel measurements. This largely reduces the cost of individual analysis and makes easier complex operations. For medical applications this allows a faster diagnosis of possible deseases and identification of the best suited antibiotic or antiviral. – BioMEMs contributes to the reduction of human errors. Indeed, ease of use, reduced handling and automation of complex analyses should greatly reduce the risk of human errors. – The small size and weight of bioMEMS favours a low consumption and make them more transportable.\nTransducer\nElectrode Thermistance Photodiode Cantilever beam ... Optical or electrical signal\nReceptor ligand\nm ic\nro µF\nlu id\nic s\nys te\nm\nAnalyte\nBiofunctionalized surface\nFig. 1.2 Schematic drawing of a bio sensor\n1 Introduction 3\nAll these abilities make BioMEMS suitable for point-of-care diagnostic that could revolutionize medicine by reducing the cost and time of bioanalyses as well as the training and infrastructure needs. This will make them usable by doctors in their offices, by nurses at hospitals and even by patients themselves. A rather unique successful example of the later case, is glucose monitoring for diabetics. For this application, portable systems based on lab-on-chip are already commercially available. Biosystems connected to smartphones begin to emerge.\nThis high potential of labs-on-chip and µTAS has been been largely recognized worlwide. As evidenced by the numerous review published in the last 15 years [1– 25], a large amount of works, mainly focused for applications to human diagnostics and DNA analysis, or for the characterization of biological objects or bioprocesses, have been done. These works already demonstrated the large benefits of these miniaturized sensing systems. Some striking examples are the following one:\nFor DNA/RNA amplification and detection and for proteomics, labs-on-chip offer high gains in terms of speed. For example, LoC are able to sequence the human genome several order of magnitude faster than conventional systems and immunoassays with labs-on-chips can be done in a few tens seconds instead of a few tens minutes. Likewise, by integrating all steps, protein analyses can be reduced from hours to a few minutes. The small sise of fluidic microchannels in LoC is well suited for cell analysis and operations at the single cell level was demonstrated for the first time owing to labs-on-chip. Such a capability is demanded for physicochemical modelling of biological processes and for the evaluation of parameters for cell changes identification. LoCs also provide high speed flow cytometry and cell sorting.\nOne holy grail of BioMEMs is to realize a low cost lab-on-chip able to perform a very large number of fully automated multiplexed bio chemical analysis of real complex biological samples like blood or saliva, A lot of work remains to be done to fully exploit the potential of bioMEMS and reach this goal. This tutorial book is intended for graduate students and researchers readers motivated by this challenge and having different backgrounds in physical science and electrical/mechanical engineering.\nIt provides the basic and advanced knowledge required to design, realize and test new LoCs or µTAS dedicated to the handling and sensing of biological samples. It is clear from Fig. 1.2 that building a state of the art fully integrated LoC or µTAS is demanding. Indeed, it is necessary to master micro/nanofluidics, biochemistry and bio analysis, sensing techniques, microfabrication processes and associated characterization and testing techniques. Practical and up-to-date information on all these topics is gathered in this book: First, Chap. 2 provides the basics of micro/nano fluidics and biology as well as information on the main ex-situ and in-situ characterization techniques. Then, fabrication and packaging technologies useful for BioMEMS are examined in Chap. 3. The four following chapters provide a detailed analysis of the main phenomena used in micro/nano fluidics systems and for bioanalysis. Finally the limitations of bioMEMS and current challenges will be presented in the concluding chapter.\n4 A. Bosseboeuf and K. Chun"

Thus, projects around biosystems often involve several teams from several area of expertise. In this context, the biggest challenge which come forward before technological locks, is the ability to communicate between the different actors of the project and understand the issues of each other.\nFor this purpose, this chapter aims at giving the reader the theoretical background in the domain of fluidics and biology and detailed information on some experimental techniques used for micro/nano biosystems assessment. It is composed of brief introductions on different concepts on which the reader can rely in order to understand the other chapters of this book. Extra bibliographic resources are explicitly suggested to the reader throughout the chapter for an in-depth learning of specific aspects that are only overviewed here. The chapter is divided in four parts.\nThe first section deals with the physical concepts related to fluidics phenomenon at micro and nanoscale. The impact of miniaturization on standard hydrodynamics laws (Navier-Stokes equation, Poiseuille flow, convection and diffusion in microfluidics channels) are discussed in the four main domains of microfluidics, i.e. the continuous flow (lab-on-chip), the centrifugal flow (lab-on-disc), the digital flow (droplet microfluidics) and the capillary flow (paper-based microfluidics).\nThe second section is an introduction to biology and biomolecular interactions. It starts with a brief reminder on biochemistry (atoms, molecules, functional groups, proteins). Then, the relationship between the structures of the proteins and the associated biological functions is demystified. In particular, the role of DNA, RNA, enzymes and antibodies are explained. Metabolic pathways and gene regulatory networks, which realize biological functions are also discussed. Finally, mathematical tools that are commonly used to model and simulate such systems are also presented.\nThe two last parts are focused on measurement techniques, and more specifically the micro-particle image velocimetry technique (MicroPIV) and some ex situ characterization techniques mostly based on optical properties. Standard PIV techniques as well as the consequences of the scale down to microPIV are discussed. First, the properties of fluids at microscopic level (density, viscosity, surface tension, interfacial tension, contact angle) are reminded. Then, experimental aspects and the main applications of microPIV (e.g. droplet formation, blood flow measurement, wall shear stress measurement, rheology, etc.) are described. The ex situ characterization techniques considered are colorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy. For both, the physical principles, the experimental set-up, the characteristics of elements that compose the set-ups and their applications are described.\n8 O. Français et al."

      "text" : "Microfluidic deals with the flow study at microscale and its implementation within micro-channel networks. The applications concern a large number of industrial domains such food sector, biotechnologies or chemical analysis with the advantages of small volumes and well-controlled manipulation. Microfluidic is at a crossroad between biology, physic, chemistry and engineering. It benefits from progress in microelectronics for its achievement and physical effects that occur at this scale with the size reduction. Nowadays, microfluidic can be seen as a toolbox for scientific research [1] but also for industrial engineering [2].\nConcerning the domains associated, the microfluidic world can be divided into four principles (Fig. 2.1): (i) continuous flow [3] (case of classical microfluidic used in Lab On Chip where pressure driven handle the flow), (ii) centrifugal flow [4] (case of Lab On Disc devices based on spinning effect), (iii) digital flow [5] (case of two phase flow with droplet generation) and (iv) capillary flow [6] (associated to paper based microfluidic).\nIn this section, the Physics behind these four categories will be covered from a basic point of view, having in mind the impact of the miniaturization [7]. First of all, continuous hydrodynamics must be discussed taking into account the scaling factor of miniaturization. In fact, fluidic flow at micro-scale is mainly driven by pressure and viscous losses. As consequences, the Navier-Stokes equation governs the mass transport and the diffusion associated. For the diphasic flow (droplet), capillary phenomena dominate and enable stable droplet generation. With centrifugal flow, inertial effects are exploited to move liquid within microchannel embedded inside the disc. Finally, the surface tension drives the fluid front inside paper and thus induces liquid and mass transport towards analysis zone.\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 9\n2.2.1 Taking Benefits from Size Reduction Within Microfluidic Devices"

      "text" : "Flow behavior in miniaturized channels can be estimated using dimensionless parameters, which indicate the predominant physical phenomena, by a ratio study. These scaling laws rule the world, define life behavior and have many applications concerning miniaturization [8].\nAs a first approach, with size reduction, volumetric effects will decrease faster compare to surface and linear effects. The classical effects of fluid physics at human scale may be completely opposite at microscale. To illustrate the scaling laws, one example is the capability for insects to walk on water compared to human that sink into it. The physic is the same for the two scales, but the consequence not… It’s a matter of balance between the gravitational force (Fg), which depends on mass of the object and thus depends on three power with size (Fg [s]3), and the capillary force (Fc) associated to the surface tension coefficient multiplied by the contact perimeter, with a dependence of one power with size (Fc [s]1).\nThus, at microscale the capillary force dominates compare to gravity force. The ratio between the capillary and gravity forces increases with the size reduction. It becomes greater than one at millimeter scale.\nBased on this scaling approach, the predominant physics for liquid handling at microscale can be predicted and confirmed with the classical parameter values used in the field of microfluidic.\nThe volumes involve in microfluidic are in the order of the nano-liter. A microchannel with a hydraulic diameter DH of 50 lm and a length of 1 cm corresponds to a volume of 20 nano-liters. To compare, a metric droplet corresponds to 50 ll, which fills 25 m of a channel with DH = 50 lm."

      "text" : "At microscale, classical physical laws can be used but the predominance forces or effects must be carefully examined to well understand the principle of microfluidic device [9].\nReynolds number: Re\nThe Reynolds number (Re) represents the ratio between fluid inertial forces and viscous forces (Eq. 2.1). Its value gives the regime of the flow. For a value below one, the regime is laminar and thus reversible with well-defined and stable flow path. Above three thousands, the regime is turbulent and gives complex pathway for the flow velocity line, which is totally instable [10].\n10 O. Français et al.\nRe is defined by the formula:\nRe ¼ qVLg ! S 2 ð2:1Þ\nAs L represents the characteristic length of the channel and V is a distance over the time, the dependence with size for Re is a two power. It means that reducing the size by a factor ‘k’ will impact Re value by a factor k2 and tends to greatly reduce its value.\nFrom values used in microfluidic (see Table 2.1), Re varies in the range:\n0:001\\Re\\0:2 ð2:2Þ\nConsequently, it means that the flow within microfluidic channel can be well controlled and studied with a deterministic behavior (Fig. 2.2). The flow is laminar; the viscous effect dominates compared to inertial effect.\nPeclet number: Pe\nThe Peclet number (Pe) characterizes the nature of the mass transport by a ratio between the time of diffusion (tD) and the time of convection (tc) (Eq. 2.3) [11]. The diffusion time, due to the Brownian’s motion, is inversely related to the diffusion coefficient (D) of the molecule while the convection time is directly linked to the flow velocity (V). For a distance ‘L’ of transport, the expression of tD and tc are:\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 11\ntD ¼ L 2 D and tc ¼ LV ð2:3Þ\nIt gives the expression for Pe:\nPe ¼ tDtc ¼ LV D\nð2:4Þ\nFor a value of Pe above 1, the flow is mainly convective and the mass transport is governed by the streamlines. Below 1, diffusion dominates and the molecules spread within the medium, the velocity having no influence on the transport, at the scale of a distance ‘L’. As for Reynolds number, its size dependence is a two power, which tends to give low value for Pe, considering a mass transport over a distance ‘L’ (Eq. 2.4). Combined with the laminar flow behavior, it means a straight mass transport where mixing between two mediums will not be very efficient, as only diffusion occurs.\nAdvantages will be the design of chemical gradient generator taking into account the diffusion law within a laminar flow [12]. Applications are towards biology (chemotaxis analysis), particle handling in chemistry [13] or study of reaction in the case of molecule synthesis [14].\nCapillary number: Ca\nIn case of a biphasic flow, the behavior between the two liquids (usually water and oil) can be estimated using the capillary number (Ca) [15]. Ca is the ratio between the viscous forces and the capillary forces (Eq. 2.5). It is defined with the expression:\nCa ¼ gVr ð2:5Þ\nThe capillary force tends to reduce the interfacial area, in opposition the viscous force tries to extend it. At Ca number below one, droplet will be stable and reproducible (monodisperse) with a spherical shape. The flow behavior is similar to a dripping jet. With Ca number above one, droplets are stretched and unstable. The flow behaves with jetting shape between the two phases.\nIn microfluidic, as Ca is directly proportional to the scale of the object, size reduction favorises low value for Ca. Usual value for Ca are between 0.001 and 1.\nBond number:\nThe Bond number (Bo) compares the gravity force over the capillary force [16]. Its formula is given by:\nBo ¼ ql 2g r\nð2:6Þ\nBased on this relation, the capillary length lc is defined when Bo = 1:\n12 O.

Français et al.\nTo modify the interface between the two fluids and generate a segmented flow composed of droplets, the shear stresses (viscous forces) must be able to break the surface tension (capillary forces) at the interface.

The flow focusing design (Fig. 2.10a), based on the injection of the segmented phase coaxially into the continuous phase, had been proposed by Anna et. al in [28]. Droplets are emitted periodically at the nozzle of the flow focusing.\nThese two topologies are commonly used in droplet based microfluidic technology due to their simplicity of fabrication and use [29]. Highly monodisperse microdroplets are produced at kHz rates and generally made of aqueous solution dispersed in a continuous non-miscible inert carrier oil phase [15].\nIn order to stabilize the droplets and avoid coalescence between them, a surfactant is added to the continuous phase. Surfactants are molecules composed of two parts: one hydrophobic (tail) and one hydrophilic (polar head). It creates a layer at the interface that prevent coalescence between contacting droplets [5]. Of course, it affects the surface tension value by decreasing it.\nIn order to estimate the droplet radius formation, a balance between the surface tension and the viscous stresses can be calculated (Eq. 2.30). The first tends to reduce the interfacial area in order to minimize the energy, the second tries to extend the interface following the stream.

The residual is composed of ions and other atoms, the most relevant being the calcium which is as abundant as sulfur in some organisms.\nExcept for some elements, namely the noble gases, a standalone atom is not stable because of an incomplete external electron shell. To reach stability, they\n26 O. Français et al.\nshare electrons with other atoms in order to form molecules. A shared pair of electrons is a covalent bond and the number of covalent bond an atom should have to be stable corresponds to its valence (Table 2.2). The simplest example is the dihydrogen (H2) molecule, composed with two H atoms sharing one covalent bond (Fig. 2.16a).\nElectron sharing is not always equitable because some atoms can be more avid of electron than others. In this case, the electron pair is pulled by the most avid atom and becomes a polarized molecule. The “pulling power” of atoms is quantified by their electronegativity (Table 2.2). In the example of dihydrogen, both atoms have the same electronegativity and the covalent bond is equitably shared between atoms. The molecule is nonpolar. In the case of water (H2O, Fig. 2.16b), as the electronegativity of oxygen is much higher than that of hydrogen atom, the two electron pairs are pulled by the oxygen atoms, and the molecule becomes polar. It is commonly admitted that a molecule is considered to be polar as soon as the electronegativity gap between the atoms involved in covalent bonds is over 0.4. As a consequence, H–N, C–O and C–N bonds leads to polarized molecules whereas H–C and all bonds with two similar atoms are considered as nonpolar.\nMoreover, the arrangement of atoms in a molecule always corresponds to the configuration that minimizes its free energy induced by electrostatic forces at the microscopic level. For instance, a water molecule is V-shaped and both 0.95Å-long O–H bonds form a 104.45° angle. For small molecules, these configurations can be deduced from theoretical consideration.

Ionic bonds are the most straightforward. Ions are charged molecules for which one or several atoms have a number of covalent bond that are either above or below the expected one (valence). When a negatively charged ion meets a positively charged ion, they attract each other and form an ionic bond. For example, positive sodium ion bind to negative chloride ion in order to form NaCl (salt).\nii. Hydrogen bonds rely on the same principle except that they involve polar molecules instead of ions: the positive pole of a polar molecule attracts the negative pole of other molecules. The term “hydrogen bond” comes from the fact that because of its weak electronegativity, hydrogen is always the positive pole of a polarmolecule. Hydrogen bonds occur for instance between twowatermolecules: one of the hydrogen atoms of a molecule attracts the oxygen atom of another one. These bonds are responsible for the crystalline structure of liquid water and ice.\niii. Hydrophobic bonds occur between hydrophobic molecules. As water is polar, nonpolar molecules cannot bind to water. As a consequence, nonpolar molecules are called hydrophobic. If several hydrophobic molecules are put in contact with water, they tend to clump up together by forming hydrophobic bonds in order to reduce their contact surface with water. Hydrophobic bonds occur for instance between oil molecules in water and lead to emulsions. iv.

There are also called sugars and the most common one is the glucose (C6H12O6). In living matter, glucose (as well as many other carbohydrates) is involved in a complex set of reactions (glycolysis metabolic pathway) in order to be converted into other carbohydrates, amino acids (see below), water and carbon dioxide. Glucose is also considered to be a source of energy for life as the glycolysis release a large amount of energy.\nLipids\nLipids are often assimilated to fats. Most of them are long hydrocarbon chains headed or tailed by specific functional group. The long hydrocarbon chain makes\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 29\nthem hydrophobic or at the least amphiphilic (composed of a hydrophilic head and a long hydrophobic tail). Lipids have two main function in living matter.\nFirstly as for the glucose, the degradation of lipids (especially the triglycerides) by specific metabolic pathways releases a great amount of energy. Secondly, lipids can make hydrophobic bonds with one other in order to form long damp-proof macrostructures called micelle, liposome or bilayer sheets. For instance the cell membrane consists of a bilayer of amphiphilic phospholipids whose hydrophobic tails are bond together and hydrophilic heads exposed to the inside and outside of the cell (cf. Sect. 2.4.2.3).\nAmino acids and proteins\nAn amino acid is a molecule composed of a core with two carbons, one with a carboxyl group and the other with an amino group and a side chain (radical) which differs from an amino acids to another (Fig. 2.18a, b). There are only 20 different amino acids. They are listed in Table 2.3.\nAmino acids form peptide bonds together to create long polypeptidic chains called proteins. A peptide bond is produced by the reaction between the N of the amine group of a given amino acid and the C of the carboxyl group of the other one. Thus, it releases a water molecule (Fig. 2.18c). The number of amino acids in a protein chain may vary from ten to thousands. Due to the electrical properties of each amino acid, the shape of the chain is very complex and can be declined at four levels:\n30 O. Français et al.\nNucleotides and nucleic acids\nA nucleotide is molecule composed of a five-carbon sugar, up to three phosphate groups and a nitrogenous base. Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids.\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 31\nThe most famous nucleic acid is probably the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which encodes the genome that can be considered as the blueprint of living matter. In this case, the five-carbon sugar is a deoxyribose 5-phosphate and the nitrogenous base is an adenine (A), a thymine (T), a guanine (G) or a cytosine (C) (Fig. 2.19a).\nThe sugar of a nucleotide can bind to the phosphate group of the next nucleotide in the chain (phosphodiester bond) in order to form a DNA strand (Fig. 2.19b). The structure of DNA is a double-helix composed of two complementary DNA strands, as predicted by Watson and Crick in 1953. In this structure, A always faces T and C always faces G. This complementarity is due to the fact that A and T exhibit 2 potential hydrogen bonds while G and C exhibit three (Fig. 2.19c, f). To identify the carbon is the deoxyribose, they are numbered from 1′ to 5′, as depicted in Fig. 2.19A. This notation is also used to identify the first (5’) and the last (3′) nucleotide of a DNA chain.\nBinding and separation of DNA strands are respectively called hybridization and denaturation. The ratio of hybridized form over denatured form of DNA molecule is an empirical low which mostly depends on the temperature T, the length of DNA strand N, the ratio g of G-C pairs (as the triple hydrogen bond of G-C is stronger than the double for A-T) and the concentration of positive ions such as calcium [Na+] (which operate as a screen preventing the two DNA strands to repulse each other due to negatively charges backbone). The temperature at which 50% of the DNA strands are hybridized is given by [41]:\n32 O.

Relationships between DNA and RNA from genetic point of view will be described in the next subsection.\nThe last couple of nucleotides that deserve to be discussed are the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the adenosine diphosphate (ADP). For ATP, the sugar is a ribose, the nitrogenous base is an adenine and it is tailed by three phosphate groups (Fig. 2.20). Structures of ADP and ATP are the same except that ADP has only two phosphate groups. ATP’s internal energy is very high due to the proximity of polarized P-O covalent bonds. ATP to ADP hydrolysis releases a large amount of energy which is often used to force reaction to occur (see Sect. 2.3.3.4). Conversely, ADP to ATP phosphorylation may also be coupled to reactions with very favorable energy balances in order to harvest released energy. In other words, the role of ATD and ADP in metabolism can be compared to the role of a battery in a hybrid vehicle (with the fuel and thermal motor corresponding respectively to glucose and glycolysis). ATP and ADP are used in every metabolic pathway: it is estimated that the mean mass of ATP in human body is about 250 g but total mass of ATP consumed and produced is about 50 kg a day."

      "text" : "Genetic was born in the middle of the 19th century and is still an important topic of investigation topic [42]. Making a long story short, modern genetics started in 1863 with George Mendel who studied seven characteristics of peas. He pointed out that something (a gene) in living matter should be responsible of the inheritance of several characteristics from a generation to another. Moreover, from statistical analysis, he also made the assumption that each individual has two genes, one from every parent, and that a dominance relationship exists between the different versions of these genes. It was confirmed later by Thomas Morgan’s experiments on the fruit fly. Morgan introduced two new notions: the fact that some characteristics depend of the sex of the individual and the fact that several gene are grouped in chromosomes.\nFrom 1928 to 1952, many experiment (Frederick Griffith, Oswald Avery and Alfred Hershey) have been carried out in order to find the nature of the “something” that transmit characteristics from an individual to another. They conduct experiments with mice and mice killer bacteria. They first pointed out that the “killing” characteristics can be acquired by a harmless bacteria in contact with molecules extracted from killer bacteria. With this in mind, they isolated all these molecules and reintroduced them one by one in a harmless bacterium. They observed that the bacteria become a killer after introduction of DNA.\nThe last part of the mystery was to understand how DNA created the biological function. The notion of mRNA, tRNA, codon, genetic code … which will be described in the next session have been established during the 60s by several scientists such as Ochoa, Khorana, Holley and Nirenberg. Since the 60s, advances in biotechnology and computer science led to major breakthrough in the understanding of genetic mechanisms, the deciphering of the genetic code, the study of relationships between genes and some diseases, the actions of several proteins on metabolism and even the complete decoding of the about 25,000 genes in the human body (Human Genome Project kicked off in 1990 and achieved in 2003)."

Firstly, one of the two DNA strands (namely the coding strand) is transcribed into a messenger RNA (mRNA) strand. Cells make a copies of the blueprint before manufacturing it instead of using its single original blueprint. The major actor of transcription is a specific protein, the mRNA polymerase, which reads one of the strand of DNA molecule (previously separated from the other strand by another molecule) and permits mRNA nucleotides to assemble together in front of the DNA coding strand. Of course, a cell does not transcript all its genes continuously. Most of the time, transcription is triggered by specific events and the transcription rate is regulated by the concentration of other molecules, the so-called transcription factors.\n34 O. Français et al.\nSecondly, mRNA is translated into an assembly of amino acid. Basically, three consecutive nucleotides in the mRNA sequence form a codon and each codon encodes for a given amino acid according to the genetic code (Fig. 2.21). With 64 (43) combinations for 20 amino acids, the genetic code is redundant. Translation consists in reading the sequence of mRNA three by three and assembling the corresponding amino acid. This operation requires a ribosome and transfer RNAs (tRNA). tRNAs are molecules that exhibit at one side an amino acid and at the other side an anticodon (i.e. the sequence of three nucleotides which are complementary to the codon which codes for this amino acid). As a consequence, tRNA’s anticodon recognizes its cognate codon on mRNA strand and bind to it. Ribosomes are complex molecules made of dozens of proteins. The ribosome is composed of two subunits: the smallest is in charge of codon recognition on mRNA and the biggest one is in charge of making peptide bonds between the amino acids of each tRNA. The ribosome binds at the beginning of mRNA strand and slides along it up to the stop codon.\nThe third stage, which is optional, consist in adding post-translational modifications on the translated proteins to make them functional.\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 35"

      "text" : "The shape of a protein is very important in biochemistry because it mostly determines the protein’s biological function. From a macroscopic perspective, the shape of proteins can be highly diversified, but most of them exhibit at their surface specific amino acids sequences that form binding sites. Those binding sites have a shape and local electrostatic properties (e.g. positive or negative charges, propensity for hydrogen bonds …) in order to bind small molecules called ligands. The analogy that is commonly used to represent these binding sites is that of the lock and the key. A given protein may have several binding site, each of them corresponding to the same or different ligands.\nProtein-ligand binding is a natural and instantaneous phenomenon that occurs as soon as the protein and the ligand are put together in a solution. However, the reaction is not always total and there are different ways to quantify its efficiency. At the macroscopic level, we consider that only a given ratio h of sites are occupied and that this ratio depends on the ligand concentration and an affinity parameter KA. From a microscopic perspective, binding and unbinding occurs stochastically during time with a given probability and get balanced around the ratio h.\nAnother crucial notion about protein-ligand binding is the conformational change (allostery). We have to keep in mind that proteins are flexible and reach a shape that minimizes their internal energy. When a binding site is occupied by a ligand, the distribution of energy may locally change and the shape of the rest of the molecule may also change in turn. In particular, other binding sites may be affected, thus increasing or decreasing their affinity with the ligand. Allostery of proteins give a natural way to control the affinity of binding sites for one molecule by the concentration of other molecules.\nThemechanism is illustrated of Fig. 2.22 on the protein that exhibit 4 binding sites, two for the ligand L1, one for a ligand L2 and one for a ligand L3. Positive cooperativity occurs between both L1 binding site. When a binding site for L1 is occupied, the shape of the other binding site for L1 change, increasing its affinity (Fig. 2.22b). Negative cooperativity occurs between L1 and L2 sites. When a binding site for L1 is occupied, the binding site for L2 also change, decreasing its affinity (Fig. 2.22d). When the affinity decreases to almost zero, binding sites becomes competitive.\n36 O. Français et al.\nFinally, L3 is not affected by the fact that L1 is occupied. The binding site are independent (Fig. 2.22f). Conformational changes are symmetric and reciprocal. In our example, the increase in affinity of the top L1 site when the bottom L1 site is occupied is the same as that of the bottom L1 site when the top L1 site is occupied (Fig. 2.22c). Similarly, the decrease in affinity of the L1 binding site when L2 is occupied is the same as that of the L2 binding site when L1 is occupied (Fig. 2.22e)."

      "text" : "Antibodies are proteins used for the recognition of specific small amino acid sequences called antigens. The antibodies are Y-shaped (Fig. 2.23a) and are composed of four polypeptic chains: two heavy chains (HC) and two light chains (LC) interconnected by disulfide bridges. Each chain is composed of different\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 37\nfragments: 3 or 4 constants and 1 variable for the heavy chains, 1 constant and 1 variable for light chains. The antigen that the antibody can recognize is determined by the two variable fragments. The binding between an antibody and an antigen leads to an immune complex mainly composed of hydrogen bonds. In practice, an antigen may have multiple binding sites (epitopes) for multiple antibodies.\nThere are several types of antibodies. The first distinction that is made is between the monoclonal antibodies and the polyclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies detects only one single epitope of an antigen whereas polyclonal antibodies is a mixture of antibodies able to recognize multiple epitopes on the same antigen (Fig. 2.23b, c). The name of antibodies often ends by the suffix—mab or— pab. A complete nomenclature of antibodies has been established in 2008 in order to assign a unique and generic name to a given antibody as a function of its target (bacterium, fungus, immune system …) and its source (human, mouse, primate …).\nAntibodies are used by living cells as key molecules for the immune response according to different mechanisms [43]. For example, different types of antibodies are present near or at the surface of immune cells in order to detect and fix toxins from pathogenic bacteria, preventing them from harming. Similarly, free antibodies can recognize specific antigens at the surface of pathogenic bacteria, bind to them with their variable side and bind in turn to macrophages (cells responsible for the digestion of foreign bacteria) with their fixed side.\nAntibodies are also widely used in biotechnology. Their modular structure provide an easy way to detect and fix various proteins with a high level of selectivity. For instance, they are used in biosensors to fix proteins on a surface for further analysis (e.g. in piezoelectric biosensors, antibodies are spotted at the sensor surface and fix protein from the reaction chamber which lead to weight changes measured by the piezoelectric plate) [44]. Other application of antibodies are flow cytometry to differentiate cells [45] or in several experimental protocols to sort proteins of interest from a solution containing many different molecules [46]."

The name of enzymes always ends by the suffix—ase and the radix is often related to the substrate or the product of the reaction they catalyze. To understand the action of an enzyme in a chemical reaction, let us first consider a reaction converting a substrate S into a product P. Let GP and GS be the free energy of the product and the substrate. The reaction occurs only if the energetic balance DGo ¼ GS GP is positive. But consider now that the conversion from S to P involves an intermediate states with free energy GI [GS. The difference GI GS is the activation energy EA, i.e. the amount of energy we need to invest in the reaction to go over the energy barrier (Fig. 2.23). If EA is high, the reaction will be very slow. It can be compared to a rock on a mountain. The rock would like to go down the mountain in order to decrease its potential energy. But if somewhere it is held by a rim, it will never reach the valley, except if someone gives it enough energy to go over the rim by pushing it.\n38 O. Français et al.\nThe role of the enzyme is to provide another intermediate states with a lower and activation energy E0A. As E 0 A\\EA, the reaction is faster. Continuing the analogy with the rock, the enzyme creates another pathway from the top of the mountain to the valley on which rims are lower.\nFrom a chemical point of view, enzyme act on the substrate like a nutcracker on a nut. Substrate and enzyme binds together to form a complex in which the transformation from the substrate to the product requires less activation energy in comparison to the direct transformation without complex.\nSide chemical species may also be involved in the mechanism. Some of them are part of the reaction by providing or harvesting energy (ATP, see Sect. 2.3.1.4), atoms or functional groups. Some other are not consumed nor produced by the reaction but they improve the efficiency of the enzyme. These chemical compounds are called cofactors or coenzymes [47]. As a conclusion, it should be reminded that enzyme only speed up the reaction. It affects kinetics but not the energy balance of a given reaction."

      "heading" : "2.3.3.4 Metabolic Pathways and Regulation",
      "text" : "A metabolic pathways is a set of chemical reactions achieving a specific biological function. Such pathway includes substrates and products (starting and ending points of the pathway), intermediate species, enzymes and regulations. One of the most studied metabolic pathways is the glycolysis which transforms glucose into pyruvate (Fig. 2.24). Glycolysis involves 9 intermediate molecules, requires 10\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 39\nenzymes and 2 cofactors and produces 2 ATPs from 2 ADPs (2 ATPs are consumed in the fists steps but 4 are harvested in the last ones).\nLet us use this metabolic pathway to illustrate the role of the ATP and the effect enzymes. Firstly, focus is put on the first reaction of the pathway: the conversion of the glucose into glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). The equilibrium is reached when the concentration of the substrate and the product reach the following equation:\nDG0 ¼ R T ln P½ S½\nð2:3:2Þ\nwhere R is the gas constant (R ¼ 8:31 J K 1 mol 1Þ, T is the temperature and DG0 is the standard free energy of the reaction, which is 14:3 kJ mol 1 for the glucoseþH3PO4 ! G6P. As a consequence, at ambient temperature, at equilibrium the glucose concentration is about 300 time higher than G6P concentration. To alter this equilibrium the reaction, it is coupled to an ATP hydrolysis ATPþH2O ! ADPþHþ þH3PO4ð Þ which DG0 is 30:5 kJ mol 1. The overall DG0 of the coupled reaction is now 16:7 kJ mol 1 which lead to glucose concentration at equilibrium 1000 times lower than the concentration of G6P.\nSecond, focus is put on another reaction of this pathway: the isomerization (same chemical formula but different atomic configuration) of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphatye (GAP) into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). The reaction consists in two hydrogens transfer (Fig. 2.25) with the cis-enediol as an intermediate state. The reaction balance isDG0 ¼ 7:8 kJ=mol but the free energy of cis-enediol is very high EA ¼ 100 kJ=molð Þ. As a consequence, the reaction may occur but will be very slow. GAP isomerization can be catalyzed by an enzyme, the triose phosphate isomerase (TIM), which speed up the reaction by a factor 1010. In practice, the GAP binding site of TIM exhibits an H+ arm on the right and a negatively charged arm one on the left. When GAP binds on TPI, the two hydrogens that need to be transferred connect to these arms. In terms of energy, we are at the point C on the curve in Fig. 2.25e, which is obviously a non-stable equilibrium state. When the molecule is release, DHAP is preferred rather than GAP because its free energy is lower. According to Eq. (2), at equilibrium, there are 22 times more DHAP than GAP.\n40 O. Français et al.\nMetabolic pathways are not always active and cells have different ways to regulate them. First, it must be remembered that a reaction is never complete and the concentration ratio between substrate and products is fixed by energetic considerations (Eq. 2.39). Thus, a metabolic pathway can be blocked as soon as the concentration of a product reached the equilibrium. This natural mechanism prevents from an excessive accumulation of a products. Another way to increase/decrease enzyme’s activity is to use cofactors. For instance, the concentration of Mg2+ increase the activity of several enzymes in glycolysis pathway (e.g. hexokinase, see Fig. 2.23). Moreover, most of the metabolic pathways are self-regulated with feedback loops. For instance, G6P is an inhibitor for hexokinase. It induces a conformational change that reduce the affinity of the glucose binding site of hexokinase.\nThe number of possible regulation and, as a consequence, the complexity of the pathway increase dramatically with the number of steps and the number of molecules involved in the pathway."

      "heading" : "2.3.3.5 Transcriptional Regulation",
      "text" : "Another way to regulate metabolic pathways is to control directly the transcription of genes that encode for the enzymes involved in the pathway. The principle of DNA-level regulation is the same as for metabolic regulation except that the regulation molecule controls the binding rate of the RNA polymerase to DNA instead of an enzyme activity.\nIn practice, there is a specific DNA sequence called the promoter upstream of the gene. RNA polymerase may bind on this promoter to initiate the transcription. Several mechanisms are implemented to regulate this transcription. First, some molecules have the appropriate conformation in order to bind to the DNA on or just after the promoter, preventing the binding of RNA polymerase and the transcription. Then regulatory DNA sequences can also be found before the promoter. Those sequences form binding site for regulating molecules (transcription factors) which modify the promoter structure and increase/decrease its affinity for RNA polymerase. Sometimes, the regulation mechanism is more complex. For instance, the human insulin gene can be regulated by up to 14 transcription factors [48].\nTo illustrate the concept, the example of the lactose operon is described hereafter. Lactose operon provides bacteria with a mechanism to digest and metabolize the lactose (Fig. 2.26). The operon has been first described in 1961 by Jacob and Monod, which is considered as the first breakthrough in the understanding of gene regulation mechanisms [49]. The Lac operon is composed of two parts: first, a constitutive promoter (always active) and a gene coding for LacI and second, a regulated promoter and three genes coding for LacZ (coding for b-galactosidase), LacY (coding for b-galactosidase permease) and LacA (coding for galactoside O-acetyltransferase) on the right. The idea of the regulation is the following: if there is no lactose around the bacteria, it is a waste to produce the enzymes letting lactose enter into the cell and metabolizing it. As a consequence, the gene expression should be repressed. The repression mechanism is performed by the LacI protein\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 41\nwhich binds to the Lac promoter, preventing the RNA polymerase from transcribing the genes. Conversely, if there is a large amount of lactose molecules around the cell, some of them penetrate into the bacteria and bind LacI. This induces a conformational change that prevents LacI from binding DNA. As a consequence, genes are expressed: LacY opens channels allowing more lactose to invade the cell and LacZ breaks lactose into glucose and galactose. When there is no more lactose to consume, the last molecules of lactose unbind from LacI which is able to repress gene transcription again.\nMoreover, glucose remains the preferred energy source for bacteria. As a consequence, in presence of glucose, lactose metabolism is not required. Lactose operon is thus also repressed by glucose (not represented in Fig. 2.26).\nGene regulation can be cascaded (operons are constituted of genes that codes for transcription factors regulating other operons) in order to achieve more complex biological functions. In this case, we speak about gene regulatory networks. Moreover, regulatory network also exists at translational level: regulatory molecules modify the mRNA translation rates."

Let V(t) be an M-element vector composed of the rates of the M reaction. Because of regulations, the elements of V are not constant but depends on some elements of X. Thirdly, a stoichiometry matrix is build. It gives the number of molecules produced or consumed by each reaction. Let S be this N M matrix. Finally, most of the molecules of living matter are not stable over time and degrade with a given ratio. Thus, we also define the decay vector d, an N-element vector composed of the decay constant for each involved molecule.\nA first way to simulate the system is to compute the temporal evolution of the concentration of each species. At each time step, the variation of concentration for each species is equal to the sum of the production, consumption and degradation rate. From the quantities define here above, we can write the set of ordinary differential equation (ODE) to solve in a vector form:\ndX dt ¼ S V Xð Þ d X ð2:39Þ\nSuch equation rate can be solved with standard ODE solver (such as Matlab, SciLab, Python), with dedicated tools such as COPASI [50] but also with SPICE-like simulators [51]. An alternative way to analyze this system is to find the steady states which correspond, for each species, to a balance between synthesis rate, consumption rate and decay rate. Steady states can be obtained by solving the following equation set:\nS V Xð Þ d X ¼ 0 ð2:40Þ\nThe number species and mechanisms to take into account in an actual biological system can be very large, which often leads to large and strongly coupled ODE sets. Simulations require long computation time and lead to convergence issues. There are some tricks to simplify the model of large systems. The most usual one consists in representing the system as an interaction graph and use graph theory to identify poles that corresponds to subsystems for which high-level macro-models can be used. The approach is exactly the same as for multi-level modeling in microelectronics (e.g. in electronic circuit, a behavioral description for operational amplifier instead of a transistor-level model). For instance, let us consider a complex system involving glycolysis. If enzymes and intermediate species involved in glycolysis do not interact with the rest of the system, the full pathway can be modeled by a single\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 43\nequation giving the production rate of pyruvate as a function of the concentration of glucose and the quantity of enzyme (supposed to be constant). This macro-model allow to get rid of 9 species and 10 reaction in comparison with the complete model.\nAnother way to simplify the equation set is to use the quasi steady state approximation (QSSA). QSSA can be applied as soon as several mechanisms are very fast in comparison to other ones. In this case, the fastest reaction are considered to be always “almost at equilibrium”, i.e. between two time steps of the slowest reaction, the fastest one has reached the steady state. QSSA will be illustrated in Sect. 2.3.3.4."

Comparison between Eqs.

From a mathematical point of view, strong cooperativity leads to the following relationship: KAi KAiþ 1 ½L .

But most of the time, a binding mechanism with cooperative sites exhibits a sigmoid response and can be modeled by a Hill equation with empirical Hill constant K 0D (concentration of ½L for which half of the sites are occupied) and Hill number (between 1 and the number of sites) [53]. To illustrate the purpose, Fig. 2.27 shows examples of hð½L Þ curves for 4 binding sites with weak and strong cooperativity.\nHill’s equation is a universal model that can be applied for most of the signal of interest that are proportional to the site occupancy rate."

Most of the time in model, the concentration of RNA polymerase is considered to be high enough and does not impact the transcription rate ktr which is a constant depending only on the length of the sequence. In practice, this assumption remains questionable. By the same way, the translation rate depends on the efficiency of the ribosome which is also considered to be in excess. The translation rate of one mRNA into a protein is given by a constant ktl which also depends on the sequence length. As several copy of the same mRNA may exist and may be translated in parallel, the overall translation rate is given by ktl ½mRNA .\nDNA transcription and mRNA translation are very slow mechanism in comparison to molecule binding (timescale for the binding of transcription factor to DNA site is about 1 s whereas timescale for transcription and translation is more than 1 min [54]. As a consequence, regulation can be introduced in transcription/ translation models under the QSSA approximation. Let us first consider a promoter with a regulating sequence with four cooperative binding site for a transcription factor A. We assume that the transcription rate increases monotonically with the number of occupied binding site so that the Hill’s equation can be applied. QSSA condition allows to modulate directly the transcription rate with a term depending on the concentration of A:\nktr ¼ ktr;max aþ 1 a 1þ KAA½\nnA 0 B@ 1 CA ð2:54Þ\nwhere a ð 1Þ is the promoter leakiness (even if the promoter is repressed, a basal transcription rate exists), ktr;max is the maximal transcription rate, KA and nA are Hill’s parameters and number. KA is sometimes called activator strength because it represents the concentration of activator required to reach about 50% of the maximal transcription rate. In the case of a repressor, transcription rate decreases with the increasing site occupancy ratio. As a consequence, the expression becomes:\nktr ¼ ktr;max aþ 1 a 1þ R½ KR\nnR 0 B@ 1 CA ð2:55Þ\nwhere KR and nR play the same role as KA and nA for the activator. Expression (2.54) and (2.55) can be merged for promoter with more than one transcription factor. Same principles can be applied to the translation rate for RNA-based regulation system.\n48 O.

      "text" : "Among the different measurement techniques existing in microfluidics, two techniques have emerged: imaging (direct imaging, fluorescence imaging, shadow imaging and the following image analysis) and µPIV (Micro Particle Image Velocimetry) technique for flow field measurements. They both are valuable source of information for experimentalist. This chapter is focused on this latter technique. The origin of the µPIV dates back to the pioneer work of Santiago et al. [55] and Wereley et al. [56]. µPIV is considered as the most widespread method for measuring velocities in fluids [57].\nThe µPIV (Micro Particle Image Velocimetry) is an adaptation of already existing PIV technique to the microscale. The spatial resolution of a µPIV can be better than 1 µm [58]. It has the enormous advantage to measure the flow field in a complete plane, not like other techniques like LDV (Laser Doppler Velocimetry), or Ultrasonic Doppler Velocimetry which operate only point wise or line wise. In short, the PIV technique consists of (1) seeding the fluid with particles, (2) illuminating the fluid with a laser sheet (most of the time, a double cavity Yag Laser is used), (3) taking two images separated by a known interval of time, more precisely, each image is taken during the burst of the laser that lasts a few nanoseconds, (4) both images are divided into interrogational areas, and each of these interrogational areas is cross-correlated with the corresponding interrogational areas of the second image, (5) the mean velocity on each interrogational area is deduced by dividing the mean displacement of the particles of this area by the time between the two bursts. But unlike the PIV where the velocity field is measured in a plane created by a laser sheet obtained by expanding the laser beam in 2D by a cylindrical lens, the µPIV uses the depth offield of the imaging optics to image a “slice” of the flowing seeded fluid [59].\nSeveral companies such as Dantec Dynamics are proposing complete µPIV set-up. (www.dantecdynamics.com), LaVision (www.lavision.de) or TSI (www.tsi. com). µPIV is particularly interesting for biology research in microfluidics because it gives a mine of information about the flow, the stresses, the movement of cells, bacteria…\nIn some research fields, it has been the major source of development in the last decade, for example:\n• Droplet and bubble manipulation is a flagship for microfluidics applications. Droplets have been used as independent chemical and biological reactors for cell culture, protein crystallization, nanoparticles synthesis, enzyme kinetics [60] or biological assays for living cells [61] among others. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving the formation and motion of droplets and bubbles is necessary for the effective design of multiphase microfluidic devices [60]. µPIV is the most appropriate measurement technique to achieve this goal.\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 49\n• Growth and evolution of cells like endothelial cell under flow can be measured by µPIV in microsystems [62]. • In the rheology domain, Rodd et al. [63] think that µPIV in micro channels is the most effective technique for reliably and quantitatively characterize the kinematics of complex flow over a wide range of flow regimes."

A hydrometer is represented schematically on Fig. 2.29. The measurement is based on the Archimedes principle. A calibrated glass body dips into the sample. The part of the graduated glass emerging from the fluid depends on the density of the fluid to be measured. Companies like VWR or Fisher Scientific are selling these inexpensive chemistry lab materials.\nMore elaborate density measurement apparatus are also available like (i) hollow glass tube. The tube is filled with the fluid. The frequency of vibration of the tube is related to the density of the fluid, (ii) radiometric density measurements. The radiometric measurements are non-invasive, non-intrusive and based on gamma-ray or X-ray transmission principle: i.e. the attenuation of the radiation is proportional to the density.

      "heading" : "2.4.2.2 Viscosity",
      "text" : "The first rheological question arising is whether the viscosity of the fluid is Newtonian or non-Newtonian.\nWhen the fluid is Newtonian, its viscosity is constant, i.e. its viscosity is independent of shear rate and time. As represented in Fig. 2.30, the shear stress is then a linear function of the shear rate, i.e.\n50 O. Français et al.\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 51\ns ¼ l c\nwhere s [Pa] is the shear stress, µ [Pa.s] the viscosity, and c ¼ dUdx [s−1] the shear rate. Most of the pure simple fluids around us are Newtonian (water, alcohol, glycerol, silicone oil…). In this case, the viscosity can be measured in a viscometer. Several affordable viscometers are available like capillary, falling ball or rotational viscometers.\n• Capillary viscometer (see Fig. 2.31). This type of viscometer also named Ostwald viscometer is quite common in laboratories and is appreciated for its simplicity, precision and low cost. Its physical principle is based on the measurement of flow resistance (i.e. pressure loss) of the fluid flowing through a capillary.\nThe fluid is usually flowing under the earth gravitational force. The time necessary for a certain amount of fluid to flow through the capillary is measured. The viscosity is then calculated with the formula:\nm ¼ Kc tf\nwhere [m2/s] is the kinematic viscosity, Kc [m 2/s2] is the capillary factor and tf [s] the time measured corresponding to the flow of the volume of fluid located between the start and stop marks (see Fig. 2.31).\nThe previous formula is only valid in the laminar flow regime and is based on the Hagen-Poiseuille Law i.e. Vt ¼ pR 4DP 8Ll , where R [m] is the radius of the capillary, L [m] the length of the capillary, and DP [Pa] the pressure drop through the capillary. Several capillary viscometers with different capillary diameters may be necessary to cover larger ranges of viscosities.\n• Falling ball viscometer. The measurement is based on Newton’s law of motion. The force balance refers to a falling ball which has reached its terminal velocity. Three forces are present: the buoyancy force, the weight force and the drag force. Measurement have to be done in the Stokes’ flow regime (i.e. Reynolds number < 1). In this case, the drag force on the ball is:\nFD ¼ 3plutd\nwhere d [m] is the diameter of the ball and ut ½m=s the terminal velocity. The viscosity is then:\nl ¼ g qs qf\nd2\n18ut\nwhere qs and qf [kg/m 3] are the densities of the ball and of the fluid respectively, and g [m2/s] the acceleration of gravity.\n52 O. Français et al.\n• Rotational viscometer. In the case of rotational viscometers, the angular velocity and the torque of a rotating geometry (a disk, a bob, a spindle, a needle, a cylinder or a cup) are measured simultaneously. Knowing the exact dimensions of the geometry, and assuming a laminar flow, it is possible to calculate the viscosity. These kinds of viscosity measurements are well appreciated in industry, because the rotating geometry is directly immersed into the fluid and the reading is immediate. Rotational viscometers are not appropriate for non-Newtonian fluids viscosity measurements because of their limited accuracy and limited range of shear rates available for viscosity measurements. In this case, rheometers are necessary for a more precise and complete investigation of the viscosity of the fluid.\nWhen the viscosity is non-Newtonian (the fluid can be shear thinning, shear thickening, thixotropic (time dependent), have a yield stress….), measurements must be done in Rheometers. Blood and most polymers and polymer solutions are non-Newtonian. The simplest non-Newtonian fluids are fluids whose viscosities can be expressed by a power law (see Fig. 2.32) :\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 53\ng ¼ k cn 1\nη [Pa.s] is the viscosity, k [Pa.sn] is the consistency index, and n [-] the flow behavior index.\nAnother simple model for non-Newtonian fluids is the Carreau-Yasuda model:\ngð cÞ g1 g0 g1 ¼ 1þ k cð Þa½ n 1a\ng0 [Pa.s] is the zero shear viscosity corresponding to the first Newtonian plateau, g1 Pa:s½ is the infinite shear viscosity corresponding to the second Newtonian plateau, k [s] is a time constant, n [-] the flow behavior index and a [-] represents the width of the transition region between g0 and the power-law region.\nRheometers are necessary for rheology measurements of non-Newtonian fluids. They are expensive and sophisticated devices often used in research and able to measure viscosities in function of time shear rate, dynamic oscillations, or after a step in shear rate…. The main manufacturers are TA Instruments (http://www. tainstruments.com), Anton-Paar (http://www.anton-paar.com), Brookfield http:// www.brookfieldengineering.com). They are based on the same principle as the rotational viscometers. They simultaneously measure the angular velocity and the torque. The most common geometries are cone and plate, plate and plate, Couette or double Couette cylinders.\nIt is difficult to present the rheology in more details in this chapter, but we invite the interested reader to consult the literature on rheology (see for example [65–67]).\n54 O.

      "heading" : "2.4.2.3 Surface Tension/ Interfacial Tension/ Contact Angle",
      "text" : "Most of the fluids can be separated in two groups: (i) hydrophilic fluids (fluids having a strong affinity for water. Typical hydrophilic fluids are water solutions, glycerol, alcohol…) and (ii) hydrophobic fluids (fluids which have little or no affinity for water, like oils and most of the polymers). Hydrophilic and hydrophobic liquids in general do not mix together and can form emulsions which are thermodynamically unstable. The hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the walls of the microsystems and the interfacial tension of the two fluids are important to know because they will determine if direct emulsions (oil in water) or inverse emulsions (water in oil) are created. It will also influence the stability of the droplets and emulsions formed.\nSurface tension\nThe physical origin of the liquid/gas surface tension is the attraction existing between neighboring molecules in the liquid state. Molecules located at the liquid/ air interface have lost half of their cohesive interaction due to their immediate proximity to the gas interface. Molecules located at the interface are frustrated and therefore will tend to minimize interfacial area.\nThe surface tension c can be seen as the energy of cohesion of a molecule U divided by its surface a2 [68]:\nc ¼ U 2a2 ½J/m2\nU [J] is the energy of cohesion, a [m] is the molecule dimension. Surface tension can also be seen as a capillary force per unit length\ndW ¼ cdA\nIn the case of a squared liquid film with one of the side of length L [m] the work of the surface tension force is expressed as\ndW ¼ Fdx ¼ 2cLdx\ndW ½N m is the work of the surface tension force, dA [m2] is the variation of surface, dx [m] is the infinitesimal displacement and F [N] the capillary force.\nThe surface tension can be measured by different techniques: the spinning drop technique, the Du Noüy ring, the Wilhelmy plate, pendant drop / sessile drop, maximum bubble pressure method to cite the most popular. We will present briefly three of them (i) the Wilhelmy plate method (ii) the rising/ pendant drop, and, (iii) the maximum pressure drop.\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 55\nWilhelmy plate method\nThe Wilhelmy method is based on the measurement of the capillary force applied on an object. The object is a high surface energy plate, typically in platinum, which is taken to a flame before each measurement to avoid contamination. The plate is slowly pulled out of the bath (see Fig. 2.33a). The force goes through a maximum when the capillary forces are aligned vertically. In that case the force is F ¼ lc cosðhÞ with an angle h = 0, what becomes F ¼ lc.\nl [m] is the length of the thin plate, F [N] is the measured force and c [N/m] the surface tension. This method has a precision of about 1%. The Wilhelmy method is very popular due to its simplicity and low cost. The Du Noüy ring method is very close to the Wilhelmy method, but differs essentially by measuring the force on a ring instead of a plate.\nPendant drop and rising drop method\nA bubble or a drop is formed at the tip of a small diameter capillary (see Fig. 2.33b). The equilibrium between the hydrostatic pressure and the Laplace pressure is [68]:\ncC ¼ qgz\nwhere q [kg/m3] is the density, g [m/s2] the acceleration of gravity, and z [m] the vertical coordinate, C is the curvature assuming an axisymmetric droplet,\nC ¼ d2r dz2\n1þ drdz 2 32 þ 1 r 1þ drdz 2 1=2\n56 O. Français et al.\nThis method has an accuracy of the order of 1%, and is fully automated by manufacturer like TrackersTM form Teclis Scientific. This method has the advantage to be able to measure surface tension (gas/ liquid interface) as well as interfacial tension (liquid/ liquid interface).\nThe maximum bubble pressure method\nThe pressure of a bubble forming at a capillary is measured during the growth and ejection. The measured pressure corresponds to (see Fig. 2.33c):\nP Rð Þ ¼ P0 þ qghþ 2cR\nwhere P0 [Pa] is the atmospheric pressure, h [m] the height of the water, P(R) [Pa] the pressure measured in the capillary, and R the diameter of the bubble. This pressure goes through a maximum that corresponds to the bubble of the same diameter as the capillary. From that, the previous relation makes it possible to calculate the surface tension.\nThis method is interesting because it is able to measure the surface tension at short times and its evolution with the time, what is important for the study of surfactant migration or the presence of contamination.\nInterfacial tension\nInterfacial tension is the surface tension between two fluids, and it can be measured by pendant/rising drop method presented previously. In this case, the density difference between the two fluids has to be taken into account so that:\ncC ¼ qd qcð Þgz\nwhere C ¼ d2r dz2\n1þ drdzð Þ2 3\n2 þ 1 r 1þ drdzð Þ2 1=2, is the curvature and qc, qd [kg/m3] are the\ndensities of the dispersed and continuous fluids respectively. In the case of two liquid phase microfluidics, the interfacial tension is of primary importance.\nContact angle\nThe surface of a material is named hydrophilic if the contact angle of a drop of water on its surface is less than 90°, otherwise it is named hydrophobic (see Fig. 2.34). It is important to know whether the channel walls are hydrophilic of hydrophilic, since it will determine if droplets of oil in water or droplets of water in oil are formed at the T or flow-focusing junction. In case of hydrophilic walls, oil droplets in water are formed, and inversely in the case of hydrophobic walls, water droplets in oil are formed. As a rule, the stable continuous phase is always the one that wets the surfaces.\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 57\nThe wetting is named “total” if the droplet spreads completely. It is the case of water on very clean glass or on metal surfaces which are high energy surfaces. If the droplet stays as a drop, the wetting is partial. The spreading parameter is defined as [68]:\nS ¼ Esubstratedry Esubstratewet S ¼ cSO cSL þ cð Þ\nwhere Esubstratedry is the surface energy of the dry substrate, E substrate wet is the surface energy of the wet substrate, cso is the surface tension of the solid/air interface, cSL is the solid/liquid surface tension, and c is the liquid/air surface tension.\n• If S > 0, total wetting, the contact angle hE ¼ 0 • If S < 0, partial wetting, and it is considered as rather wetting if hE p=2 and\nrather non-wetting if hE [ p=2 • The Young relation is obtained either by a balance of the capillary forces acting\non the contact line (Fig. 2.35) and projecting them on the solid plan or by calculating the work of the forces for an infinitesimal displacement:\nccoshE ¼ cSO cSL Among the different technique existing, we will present three of them which are\nparticularly simple.\n58 O. Français et al.\n• The contact angle hE can be measured by shadowgraphy as represented in Fig. 2.34, either directly on droplets of a few microliters (typically about 5 µl) or for more precision by using a software fitting the profile of the droplet and calculating the contact angle. • For contact angle hE\\40 , the mirror droplet technique based on the optical reflectometry is to be favored [68]. The droplet is illuminated by a large laser beam perpendicularly to the substrate, and the reflection cone measured on a screen allows the determination of the mean contact angle with a precision of 0.1°. • The last technique presented here is the measurement of the contact angle by Reflection Interference Contrast Microscopy. By counting the interference fringes and the number of them, it is possible to calculate the profile of the droplet, and by that, the contact angle with a precision of about 0.1°.\nIn the case of real, not perfectly clean surfaces, an advancing and receding contact angle can be measured.\nCommercial surface tension and contact angle measurement apparatuses are available by manufacturers like Krüss Gmbh, Kibron Inc, Dyne Testing Ltd, USA KINO Industry CO. Ltd, Biolin Scientific or Data Physics Instruments, GmbH, Germany, among others.\nSurfactant\nSurfactants are usually added to the oil/ water mixture in order ease the emulsification process and to stabilize the emulsion. Surfactant are molecules that own a hydrophilic group (an anionic, cationic or non-ionic group named “head”), and a hydrophobic group (usually a hydrocarbon chain named “tail”). Because of their hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail, they are prone to locate themselves at the interfaces. They are used at concentrations going from a fraction of a percent to a few percent. They modify the surface tension and stabilize the droplet formed. The Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) is the concentration above which micelles i.e. aggregates of surfactant molecules are formed (see Fig. 2.36). It is important to be beyond the CMC to avoid interfacial tension variations by depletion, what may occur during the droplet formation process. The CMC can be determined\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 59\nexperimentally in measuring the surface tension for different concentrations of surfactant by one of the methods presented earlier. Below the CMC, the surface tension changes strongly with the concentration of surfactant while it remains almost constant above the CMC.\nThe previously presented physical properties are useful to calculate the Capillary number, i.e. the relative effect of the viscous force to the interfacial forces:\nCa ¼ lU r r r ¼ lU r\nwhere l [Pa.s] is the viscosity, U [m/s] the velocity, and r [N/m] the interfacial tension.\nThe capillary number is the driving parameter of most of the two phase microfluidics systems, and the most suitable non-dimensional number characterizing regimes of formation of droplets or bubbles."

      "text" : "µPIV has been developed on inverted microscopes [69]. Numerous companies are building these kinds of microscopes: Zeiss, Leica, Olympus, Nikon…. The easy optical access of the microfluidic microsystems (usually in transparent materials like Glass, PDMS, Plexiglass or other transparent plastics), has been used to visualize the flow field on a plan. A typical set-up is represented schematically in Fig. 2.37.\n60 O. Français et al.\nA strong light, usually a double-pulsed laser light (typically a Yag Laser), is used to illuminate fluorescent particles. But other light sources can be used like mercury lamp [55] or strong LED [72]. In the latter case, shadow imaging of non-fluorescent particles are used instead of fluorescent particles. In case of a laser, an epi-fluorescent prism transmits the laser light to the microfluidic microchannel through the objective lens of the microscope. The fluorescent particles absorb the laser light and re-emit light in a different wavelength. This fluorescent light crosses the objective lens and the epi-fluorescent prism to be received on the camera. The epi-fluorescent prism includes a filter that cuts the light at the wavelength of the laser and lets the fluorescent light go through in order to get rid of incoming laser light, of the scattered light, of the multiple reflections, of the background illumination inhomogeneity [69] and of the speckle patterns. Images are commonly taken on 12 bits CCD or CMOS camera. Double image cameras are chosen when double-pulsed laser are used.\nCamera\nMicrofluidic experimentalists often rely on high speed cameras for imaging and high temporal resolution µPIV. The main brands of high speed cameras are Phantom, Photron and Optronis. They are useful for two reasons: (i) Displacements on images are large because of extensive zooming on microscopes. Therefore, short exposure times and high frequency imaging are necessary to capture temporal evolution of the velocity field or the movement or deformation of droplets or bubbles, (ii) The physical limit of light illumination on the microchannel must be compensated by a high sensitivity of the high speed cameras in order to freeze images (very low exposure times are necessary to avoid blurred images).\nExposure times as low as 1 µs and frequencies as high as tens of thousands of images per second are used routinely in microfluidics. Since microsystems are transparent, imaging of droplets by back illumination and image analysis on softwares like ImagJ or Matlab have been a major tool to estimate the size of droplets, mixing or droplet formation to cite a few.\nDepth of field\nUnlike the traditional PIV where the measurement plane and its thickness is defined by the thickness of the illuminating laser sheet, in the case of µPIV the illumination is a volume illumination, and the thickness of the measurement plan is defined by the depth of field [69] or depth of focus [71] of the optical system. The question on how to define the thickness of depth of field form the optical system has appeared very early in the development of µPIV systems [69–71].\nThe estimated depth of field dZm of the microscope objective has been estimated by [69] to be :\ndZm ¼ 3nk0NA2 þ 2:16dp tanh þ dp\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 61\nwhere the different parameters are : NA, numerical aperture of the microscope objective, dp, the particle diameter, k0 wavelength of the light, n index of refraction and h the half angle of the objective NA ¼ nsinhð Þ.\nTo compare the previous formula with experimental results (see Fig. 2.38), 1.09 µm particles have been placed between two glass plates and images have been taken at different objective-microsystem distances (see Fig. 2.38). The experimental measurements are in good agreement with the dZm = 16.5 µm depth of field of the microscope calculated by the above analytical expression [69].\nOlsen and Adrian [71] defined a depth of correlation as the depth over which particles significantly contribute to the correlation function. They give the analytical formula\nZcorr ¼ 1 ffiffi e pð Þffiffi e p f 2d2p þ 5:95 Mþ 1ð Þ2k2f 4 M2 !\" #1=2\nwhere dp is the particle diameter, M the magnification, k the wavelength of the light emitted by the particle, f is the focal number of the lens, f n0=ð2NAÞ, NA being the numerical aperture and n0 the index of refraction of the immersion medium. e is the ratio above which the weighting function contribution of a particle located beyond Zcorr is negligible. In practice, e is usually taken as 0.01 when assuming that the out-of-focus particles have an intensity of 1% of the in focus particles [57]. Bourdon et al. 2004 [70] have validated experimentally and computationally the accuracy of this analytical formula.\nParticles\nParticles used as seeding particles in µPIV must follow the flow field, therefore (i) they must be well dispersed in the fluid (particles may be treated by surfactant grafting or by adding small amount of surfactant in case of polymer particles in a hydrophilic fluid), (ii) they must have a density close to the density of the fluid to avoid sedimentation or creaming effects, (iii) they must be small enough to follow the flow, large enough to avoid large Brownian motion that would add scattering to the velocity measurement, and large enough to be visible on several pixels of the camera. Numerous companies are providing calibrated particle, among them\n62 O.

A general tradeoff is to use seeding particles of the order of 1 µm. In case of fluorescent seeding, particles can be smaller because not the particles, but the emitted fluorescent light is imaged.\nCross correlation\nThe seeded flow is illuminated by a laser pulse of a few picoseconds while the first image is taken. The second image is taken during the burst of the second pulse (see Fig. 2.39). Each image is divided into interrogation areas of 16 16 or 32 32 or 64 64 pixels or combination thereof. It is recommended to have around 10 particles per interrogational areas. The most common technique for calculating the flow field is to use a pixel by pixel cross correlation between corresponding interrogational areas.\nCðsÞ ¼ ZZ Area I1ðXÞI2ðX sÞdX\nThe correlation produces a peak identifying the most common particle displacement dX (see Fig. 2.39). A velocity map is obtained by repeating the cross correlation over each interrogational area.\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 63\nFlow field can also been obtained by Particle Tracking, but in this case the working conditions are more severe like having less seeding particles and a good contrast so that particle can be identified clearly.\nBrownian motion\nAt small scale, Brownian motion may play a major role. Calculation of the impact of Brownian motion on the velocity has been first studied by Santiago et al. [55]. For a time interval of Dt corresponding to the time interval between the two images used for the PIV, the mean square distance of diffusion is sh i2¼ 2DDt, where\nD ¼ kT 3pldp\nwhere dp is the particle diameter, k the Boltzmann’s constant, T the temperature and µ the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. The displacement of a particle following a steady flow at a velocity u is Dx ¼ uDt over a time interval Dt.\nTherefore, the relative error due to Brownian motion is estimated by:\neB ¼ s2 1=2 Dx ¼ 1 u ffiffiffiffiffiffi 2D Dt r\neB has to remain low. Devasenathipathy et al. 2003 [73] notice that the diffusive uncertainty decreases\nas 1= ffiffiffiffi N p , where N is the number of particles per interrogational area.\nMost of the µPIV are 2D, but 3D µPIV and tomographic have recently been developed.

Furthermore, shear-induced shear stress modulates the gene expression of endothelial cells [78]. µPIV in microchannel is the way (and probably the only reliable way) to study the behavior of endothelial cells under the periodic cardiac blood flow that induces a periodic shear stress on the arterial wall covered with endothelial cells. Micropumps reproducing the cardiac cycle can be used to control the flow in a Hele-Shaw cell (a thin cell with wide X and Y dimensions, so that the flow can be considered as nearly 2D), where the walls are covered with endothelial cells [62].

The alteration of the flow in the heart leads to malformations in the cardiovascular system [79]. The biological response to the haemodynamic forces can be short term for the control of vascular tone or long term through gene expression [25]. It plays also a role in the etiology of a number of diseases, for example regions with low or oscillating wall shear stress have been linked to atherosclerosis [80]. The blood flow and wall shear stress have been measured in vivo in the outflow of an embryonic chicken heart [25, 26] by the µPIV technic with large temporal resolution. µPIV is a very reliable non-intrusive method for measuring the velocity profile with a sufficient spatial resolution to calculate the wall shear stress from the closed wall velocity gradient and therefore enables the study of the interaction between hemodynamics and the surrounding tissue [80]."

For example, the Berthelot reactant produces a blue-green solution in a quantity depending on the ammonium ion concentration. It can also be used identify a sample solution it from its color. This is named barcoding.\nThe setup is based on the measurement of the absorbance of the sample, which is considered to be in a droplet. The basic Beer-Lambert law is used to characterize the absorption for a monochromatic light source propagating in a homogeneous and isotropic medium and can be expressed as:\nI ¼ I0:10 ek:l:C\nOr\nAk ¼ log10 I I0 ¼ ek:l:C\nwhere I/I0 is the transmittance of the medium, A is the absorbance, also called the optical density, that are both unitless, ek is molar extinction generally expressed in L.mol−1.cm−1, l is the length of the optical path in the medium and C in the molar concentration generally express in mol.L−1.\nThe molar extinction ek is related to the chemical species, the wavelength and the temperature. Considering a microfluidic canal of thickness l, if ek is known, the concentration of the chemical species can be assessed by measuring the absorbance.\nIn presence of several chemical compounds the absorbance of each species are added so that the total absorbance of a droplet is given by:\nAk ¼ Xn i¼1 A eki:l:Cið Þ\nAs a consequence, n different concentrations of chemical species can be discriminated by using n different wavelengths (or bands) and by solving the\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 69\nn resulting equations. Another method consists in varying the species concentrations within the sample while the wavelength is constant. For these measurements, the reference intensity I0 has to be measured. The simplest method is to ensure that the targeted compound concentration is almost null in a specific sample. If the carrier fluid, the other species concentration and the reflective index do not change, I0 is the intensity measured with this reference droplet(s). For paper based microfluidics, it can be difficult because a dry paper has a different reflective index than wet paper [82].\nThe scheme of the general principle optical setup is given in Fig. 2.44. Reflective based methods are possible but less sensitive. This is a very straight forward measurement approach and many parts of this setup can be very simple and cheap. The main challenges of this setup are:\n(1) Ensuring that most of the light is passing through the sample, e.g. a droplet, in order to obtain the maximal sensitivity and to be able to carry out a quantitative assessment of the measured concentration. (2) Ensuring a low noise measurement in order to obtain a sufficient signal to noise ratio. Indeed, in regards with the very low canal thickness l, the variation of the light intensity can be very weak, thus the signal to noise ratio must be kept high in order to be able to discriminate the lowest concentrations.\n70 O.

Indeed, the commercially available LEDs are covering a large spectrum from UV to visible and Near infrared. Alternatively, polychromatic light sources such as white LED, incandescence/halogen lamp [84] and supercontinuum can also be used in addition with optical bandpass filter. For instance, thanks to its additional Bayer filter that acts as a bandpass filter, a simple mobile phone camera can be a cost effective devices for colorimetric device [85, 86]. Because it is cost effective, colorimetry is often used with very low cost paper-based microfluidics. For example, the use of a switched tri-color LED (Red, Green Blue) and a single photodetector allows transmittance colorimetry measurement with very low cost [82] (*50$).\nHowever for a complete characterization, a wavelength sweep is required. It can be implemented with a white light source followed by a prism or a monochromator. A moving hole determines the wavelength. For example, it has been used to characterize more precisely a low cost colorimetric system [87]. Improvement of the technique includes modulating the light source and using a lock-in amplifier for readout. Placing the light source and the sensor in the canal axis is better, as the thickness is increased, but it requires chip modification.

      "heading" : "2.5.3 Fluorescence Spectroscopy",
      "text" : "2.5.3.1 Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy\nFluorescence spectroscopy is based on the absorption of light by a fluorescent substance which will re-emit a photon at higher wavelength [88]. This Stockes shift is exploited to separate the fluorescence light from the source (see Fig. 2.45). The fluorescent substance is called fluorophore or fluorochrome. It can either be the biomolecule we want to measure directly (intrinsic), or a fluorophore attached to a target molecule (extrinsic). A fluorophore can also be used as an indicator with fluorescence properties which depends on the presence of the target molecule. The progress in biochemistry provides many ways (from simple and direct to complex and indirect) to extract the information of interest for the biologist from a measurement of fluorescence. Once the biochemistry is set, three main techniques are applicable for Lab on Chip to read the fluorescence information: Intensity, Polarization and Lifetime. It is important to maximize the intensity of light that is measured for the three techniques because of noise and other parasitic signals. It is based on the principles described in this section that are also applicable to phosphorescence, which is another type of luminescence.\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 71\nFluorescence measurement offers a better contrast than colorimetry. For example let’s consider that one wants to make the difference between no product and a product at low concentration. Colorimetry measures a small decrease of a large light intensity caused by absorption. As a consequence, the relative variation is weak. Although fluorescence depends also on absorption of photons, fluorescence is detected only if there is product because what is detected is only what is reemitted. Therefore the relative variation is much larger. This is important because, even for high throughput application, concentrations are often lower than 1 µM. The detection limit of fluorescence spectroscopy can be lower than 1 nM. In this respect, colorimetry is very limited as the detection limit is in the order of 1 µM.\nNonetheless it should be noted that, because this technique still depends on absorption, the fluorescent signal intensity increases with the effective number of fluorophore molecules that has actually absorbed light. In order to not waste the incident light, the light intensity can be concentrated using a collimated laser beam as a light source. However the relative shallowness of the microfluidics canal is a problem because for a typical concentration of product the laser beam is not totally absorbed and passes through the canal. In this respect, techniques depending only on the detection of product at surface level (i.e. CHEMFET, SPR) do not suffer from the thickness reduction. However these techniques require the integration of a sensing element inside the canal contrary to the fluorescence spectroscopy.\nThe product absorbs the following light intensity Ia according to the beer lambert law:\nIa ¼ I0 1 10 ek l C I0 ek l C lnð10Þ\nwhere I0 is the incident light intensity from the source. If the laser spot is smaller than the canal and we neglect the loss on the light path from the laser to the inside of the canal, I0 is the laser intensity. ek is the molar extinction coefficient of the product and is dependent of the wavelength of excitation. l is the thickness for a\nλ\nNormalized intensity\nEmission\n500μm450μm 550μm\n1\nExcitation\nFig. 2.45 Image of a fluorescence excitation and emission spectrum (fluorescein)\n72 O. Français et al.\nlight coming orthogonally to the plane of the microfluidics chip. C is the concentration of the product. For low concentration and thickness, the absorbed light is proportional all these four parameters (I0, ek, l, C).\nThe fluorescence emission depends on Ia but also on the quantum yield (Q.Y.) because not all absorbed photon are reemitted. For the fluorescein fluorophore this quantum yield is 95% in a 0.1 solution of NaOH at 22 °C but for Tryptophan, which is one of the amino acid responsible for the fluorescence of many proteins, the quantum yield is only 14% in water at 20 °C. This quantum yield depends on the non-radiative decay, quenching by other species (e.g. dissolved oxygen) and transfer of an exited state such as RET (resonance energy transfer). The latter can induce the emission of a photon but not from the considered fluorophore. When excited with a constant light source, the average reemitted intensity is Ie = k Q Ia, where k is a coefficient taking into account the Stockes shift on the entire emission spectrum. It is smaller than 1 because the emitted photons are less energetic than the absorbed ones. As this light is reemitted in all directions, only a fraction of it can be collected through a microscope objective.\nThe absorption of a photon is quasi instantaneous as soon as the photon arrives but it is not reemitted immediately. The average time to reemit the photon is called the lifetime (s). The probability that the photon is emitted after a time t is:\npðtÞ ¼ 1 s e t s\nTo observe this phenomenon, a very short pulse of light should excite the fluorophores and a high bandwidth light sensor should measure the temporal response that is an exponential decay. When the incident light is constant the emitted light is also constant because of averaging effects. Zooming in time and looking at the emission of photons one by one show that it is a Poisson process. This results in quantum noise that can affect the measure for low intensity [89].\nIf the light is polarized, only the fluorophores with a transition moment aligned with the electrical field of the incident light are excited. The polarization of fluorescence will depend on the orientation of the transition moment at the emission of the photon. Due to agitation the fluorophores move and rotate and one can define a rotational correlation times that depends strongly on the size of the fluorophore. It is typically in the order of ns or tens of ns for a macromolecule. If the lifetime is much higher than this time, the polarization of the light is lost. As the lifetime of phosphorescent molecules is in the order of ms, anisotropy cannot be applied in this case. Fortunately the lifetime of many fluorophores are typically in the order of ns or tens of ns. Therefore one can expect a change in the polarization of light if the fluorophore attaches to a macromolecule bigger than itself.\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 73"

      "text" : "Research and development in biology make intensive use of spectrofluorometers, whether the sample is placed in a chamber or in microplate array for parallelization and achieving high throughput analysis. However, although the same principle is used and the optical setup is similar for analysis, most of the time it has to be adapted to read a microfluidics chips and the optical setup is built around the chip. Sometimes the chip is placed on an inverted epifluorescence microscope, offering great flexibility for visualization. Obviously the format of the microfluidics chips differs but also the way of achieving high throughput and small volumes is a completely different concept. The microplate readers use parallelization of the sensors and robotic arms while the samples are static in a well. Using microfluidics, the sample is preferred to be contained in a moving microdroplet although sensors can be easily parallelized due to small size. With a rate of 1000 droplets/s the same rate of analysis is achieved with a single sensor. This is much faster than using robotic arms while simplifying the setup.\nHere, we will consider mainly that samples are contained in a flow of droplets passing in a canal, unless specified otherwise. Static analysis is possible with the same apparatus by moving the chip (with either a manual or a motorized system). One can also analyze static droplets in stop-flow or EWOD (electrowetting on dielectric) or also Dielectrowetting [90]. Differential measurement with moving droplets is easy because, when the oil separating two droplets is passing by, a reference signal can be read if the oil is non fluorescent. Ideally the spectrofluorometer can excite fluorescence and read it at any wavelength. It uses a white and stable light source (e.g. a Xenon lamp) that is either filtered or passed through a monochromator in order to select a wavelength. While it can still be used, it is more convenient to use a collimated laser source. Whereas the wavelength is fixed, the size of the beam offers an easy way to focus the intensity for more efficiency. If several wavelength of excitation are required, lasers beam are combined as well as the detectors for each spectrum of emission. Laser can also be coupled to an optical fiber to excite the fluorophore. The emission can also be collected with the optical fiber so that the probe location can be easily displaced.\nA limitation of the laser beam intensity is the alteration of the microfluidic chips or the samples. At high intensity photobleaching of the fluorophore can be problematic for long measurement. Material should be chosen to be transparent to the wavelengths of interest, which are not necessary in the visible spectrum. For example, common borosilicate glass absorbs UV below 300 nm. The fluorescence of the material should be low and is problematic for weak intensity measurement. The fluorescence of the glass depends strongly on impurities inside. In [90], the experiments at 4 wavelengths show that a commercial borosilicate glass has a slightly lower autofluorescence than plastic materials (PDMS, PC, COC and PMMA). It also depends on the excitation wavelength. Photobleaching of the material is possible but it does partially recover [91].\nA confocal setup also helps to remove the fluorescence of the material and other interfering lights by reducing the depth of focus. This way, only the light coming\n74 O. Français et al.\nfrom the focal plane is collected. As only what happen in the thickness of the canal is of interest, the optical requirements are relatively low, i.e. much less than a confocal microscope with 500 nm or less axial resolution. In [92], authors use a relatively big pinhole size of 500 µm and a 20 0.75 NA objective. It results in a 14 µm probe depth, still smaller than the droplet thickness. Background parasitic signal can also be removed by two-photon absorption. In this case the measured fluorescence is concentrated at the focal point. The probe volume is very small, typically less than 1 µm side [93].\nSmall probe volume can be required for Single Molecule Detection (SMD). It is often achieved with Spatial Two-Photon Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy [94]. However microfluidics offers the advantage to perform SMD through dilution without using an ultra-small probe volume. It benefits from the high repeatability on a large number of droplets in a small time that makes possible good statistical analysis [95]. Integrated fiber optics (or optical waveguides) may also improve the spatial resolution but it is limited by focusing issue at the blunt end of the fiber if there is no special ending [96–98]. Integrating spherical lenses to benefit from photonic nanojet is effective [99, 100]. However these integrations require major changes in the process of fabrication of the chip.\nUnless it is required, having a too small probe volume can be problematic. If the droplet content is inhomogeneous there is a risk that the fluorescent target is missed or in a region where the incident light is different (Fig. 2.46). This is a strong source of discrepancy for cell analysis in droplets for example. To avoid this, the light can be spread on a fine line across the canal width [101].\nOther parameters to consider for fluorescence analysis in microfluidics are the pH (fluorophore are very sensitive to pH and a buffer is required), temperature (less sensitive), the formation of “excimer” with some fluorophores at high concentration. The latter causes a change of the fluorescence spectrum because of a change in the fluorophore nature. The biochemistry should take into account the environment\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 75\nof the fluorophore including the surfactant if there is any in the droplet. It is preferable to use a surfactant dissolved in the oil unless the surfactant is part of the biochemistry. For example, the surfactant is functionalized in [102]. With microfluidics, canal edges can also be problematic because the reflection of the laser beam on it can cause cross coupling in multiple points measurement for example. Another source of coupling is the diffusion of the fluorophores through the oil [103]. It is fortunately typically slow and depends strongly on the fluorophore, the liquids and the surfactant.\nSometimes, the biochemistry method needs a functionalized surface. Without modifying the process to functionalize the microfluidics chips it is possible to use functionalized magnetic bead. They are commercially available."

      "text" : "The Fig. 2.47 shows the optical setup for fluorescence spectroscopy with two static excitation monochromatic light sources that can be used simultaneously: blue (k0) and green (k1). Collimated laser sources suits very well for the application. Preferably they should be stable (power regulated if using laser diodes) because the measurement is sensitive to intensity. This setup also offers the possibility to read the fluorescence signal on two bands of interest: yellow with sensor S0 and orange with sensor S1. Each sensor measures the intensity over a certain time. This time can be long for a static observation in a microfluidics chamber. As the kinetic of the reactions are relatively slow, it is possible to average to obtain a good signal to noise ratio. For high throughput droplet analysis higher sensor bandwidth is required while the period of observation is shorter. Photomultiplier Tubes\n76 O. Français et al.\n(PMT) are well suited in terms of performances (sensitivity, resolution, bandwidth, quantum yield). Furthermore the controlled amplification is adjusted to the signal level on a large dynamic range. The scintillator of the PMT should exhibit a good quantum yield at the considered wavelength. Alternatively Avalanche Photodiodes (APD) may also offer good performances [104].\nThe two light sources are combined in a single beam with a dichroic mirror which transmits the green light (k1) without deflection and reflects the blue one in a specular way. The transition from transmission to reflectivity of this kind of mirror is quite sharp because it is based on interference with thin film layer. The mirror on the blue (k0) source of light makes a 90° turn to the beam but its main purpose is to offer a convenient way to adjust the blue beam spot on the dichroic mirror onto the outcoming spot of the transmitted green beam (k1). It is preferable to have two fine knobs (tip and tilt, grey circle in Fig. 2.47) to adjust the orientation of the mirror plane and therefore the orientation of the laser beam and where it will hit the dichroic mirror. It should be noted that two degrees of freedom are enough to fully define the orientation of a beam. However, having two superposed spots on the dichroic mirror is not enough because the two beams can separate again. The two fine adjustment screws of the dichroic mirror will ensure that the beams are superposed and will hit the microfluidic chip at the same location. In theory, having two non-superposed laser beams hitting the chips at the same location is possible, if they are not too far from each other, but in practice superposition is recommended.\nAfter passing through another dichroic mirror, the superposed beam reaches a telescopic system of two mirrors to align this beam along the axis of the objective. Without these 4 degrees of adjustment the position and orientation of the green laser would be necessary and it is much less convenient. The telescopic system enables also to change the direction of the beam if this setup is to be adapted on an inverted epifluorescence microscope for example. The objective can be the one of an epifluorescence microscope whether it is implemented in a microscope or not. If not mounted of a microscope, the objective or the chip should be placed on a translator to finely place the focal plane on the sample location in the chip. 2D translation of the chip in the focal place is also necessary to precisely hit the sample at its location. The size of the beam spot on the microfluidics chip is proportional to the wavelength, to the focal distance and inversely proportional to the initial beam diameter. These relations come from the limit of diffraction. For example, if the spot size is 200 µm with a focal distance of 12 mm and it will be 20 µm for 1.2 mm. A good numerical aperture will collect the maximum light but it requires a short focal distance for a given objective lens diameter. The microfluidics canal wall thickness will limit the focal distance.\nThe collected light is collimated when coming out of the objective. When reaching the first dichroic mirror on its path, it is reflected. The cutoff wavelength of this dichroic mirror should be between the excitation and the emission. However a small but still significant part of the laser beam, which comes from a reflection on the microfluidics chip, is also reflected by the dichroic mirror. It should be noted that dichroic mirror have a typical transmission coefficient of 90%. It means that 10% is reflected even for a wavelength inside the transmission band (it is normally a\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 77\nnon-dissipative element). Two sharp notch filters of high attenuation order (typically 5 or more) are used to remove efficiently the remaining excitation signals. Another dichroic mirror is used to separate the two bands of wavelength (yellow and orange on the example of the Fig. 2.47). A fluorescence filter is used to further filter what is outside the band considered (e.g. environmental light of the room). These filters are also based on interference in order to be very selective. In case that it is not sufficient and that differential measurement cannot be used (no droplet), it is possible to use a classical scheme with modulated light source and a lock-in amplifier to read out the signals.\nBased on the same principle, the presented setup can be adapted for a single or more excitation light source and a single or more optical sensor. In practice, it is more convenient to measure the fluorescence while observing the microfluidics chip. For example it is possible to see where the laser spot hits the chip while making sure that droplets are properly formed in a canal. A white source of light (e.g. halogen lamp) is filtered and lightens the part of the chip to be observed (see Fig. 2.48). The filter is either high pass, low pass or band pass depending on where is a window of wavelength available. This light should not excite the fluorophores but also should not be measured as a fluorescence signal by the sensors. A dichroic mirror is used to separate the image (toward the camera and its optics) from the fluorescence signal. In an alternative configuration to the Fig. 2.48 setup, the image can go straight and the rest is reflected. A part of the fluorescence signal can also go toward the camera to have an image of the spot superposed with the image of the canal. Inverted microscope can be featured with wheels to hold and select the filter or the dichroic mirror so that the setup is adaptable. A safety filter should be added before the binocular to cutoff the excitation wavelength because reflection in the eyes is a risk."

On the sensing side a polarization cube separates the two components (see Fig. 2.49). A polarization filter with the proper orientation is added before each sensor to further remove the unwanted component of the light. Finally the measurement is performed by calculating the polarization (P) or the anisotropy (r) from the intensity (I// and I⊥) measured by the two sensors:\nP ¼ I== I? I== þ I?\nð2:5:6Þ\nr ¼ I== I?

      "heading" : "2.5.3.5 Setup for Time Resolved Fluorescence",
      "text" : "Implementing time-resolved fluorescence does not modify the optical setup of Fig. 2.47. The light of source must be pulsed (see Fig. 2.50) at a rate higher than the droplet rate but smaller than at least 5 times the lifetime to measure. Pulse duration should be much smaller than the lifetime of the fluorophore (typically some ns). The pulse duration of laser diodes can be in the order of hundreds of ps [105]. It makes it suitable for many fluorophores. Many lasers offer better performance in terms of pulse duration or power but are more expensive and sometimes very long to stabilize.\nFor the implementation presented on Fig. 2.50, the sensor must have a high bandwidth. The lifetime s is extracted from the exponential decay contained in the sensor signal. Another way to obtain the exponential decay is called Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC). It consists in measuring the arrival time of each single photon after a pulse with a Time to Digital Converter (TDC). The resolution of the TDC is in the order of the lifetime of smaller. The histogram of these arrival times is the exponential decay from which the lifetime is extracted. Single photon counting offers very good sensitivity. However, it requires that no more than one photon is received after a pulse. Otherwise there is a risk that two photons arrive too close. The second would fall into the dead time of the photon detector and would not be detected. As the photon emission is a Poisson process the probability is never null but for 1 photon over 10 pulses the lifetime estimation is quite accurate (3%, [106]). This is reserved for low intensity. It has been shown to be applicable, using Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPAD) as detectors, for\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 79\ndroplet analysis [107] at about 1000 droplets per second. The standard deviation on the lifetime measurement is limited by the quantic noise and is 1= ffiffiffiffi N p , N being the total number of received photon. Similarly to polarization, although it offers different possibilities, time resolved spectroscopy does not depend on the global intensity level. Intensity only affects signal to noise ratio. Therefore it is less sensitive to parameters such as light source stability and drift, concentration or thickness of the canal."

This is useful to identify the droplet that is analyzed, particularly in high throughput application [111]. However the spectral resolution is too poor for many applications. Using several sensors with different fluorescence filters as in Fig. 2.47 is better but the number of sensors is limited. A prism or a monochromator will achieve better spectral resolution. Due to dispersion a spot of light is transformed in a 1D line of light. Each sensors put on this 1D line measured the intensity at a different wavelength (Fig. 2.51). If the fluorescence comes from a 1D line, the result is a 2D surface to be measured with a camera. One dimension is the spectral resolution and the other is the spatial resolution. An alternative is to use one dimension for spectral resolution and the second dimension for time resolution with a streak camera [112].\nRaman scattering spectroscopy demands a very good resolution for distinguishing the emission peaks that characterize the sample. The Raman scattering is the absorption of a photon by a material and reemission at a lower wavelength (anti-stockes) because the material has lost energy. The spectrum of the emitted signal contains peaks that are a fingerprint of its chemical nature and its surrounding. It can be measured with a setup similar to the fluorescence spectroscopy. However the Raman diffusion is too low and mixed with other phenomenon\n2 Basics of Micro/Nano Fluidics and Biology 81\n(e.g. Mie and Rayleigh diffusion).

The information is mostly binary. If there is an interaction the molecule may be potentially a drug and is further studied with other techniques. Robotic equipment working with microplate array are intensively used to accelerate the test and reduced the quantity of chemicals per test. However, volumes that are smaller than microliter are very difficult to manipulate and the throughput is limited by the mechanical speed of the robot and parallelization. Microfluidics overcomes the difficulty of manipulating small volumes as a 100 pL or smaller droplet is a routine with this technology. The droplet rate offers much higher throughput than robot capabilities. On one hand, there is still a difficulty for injecting the large number of products in a sequential way in the chip. On the other hand, it is easy to dilute an injected product to test it at different concentrations and obtain dose response at high speed. It been implemented with fluorescence spectroscopy in [114]. As some products react only for a certain range of concentration, this prevents false negative test.\nFlow cytometry consists in counting the number of cells in a solution flow and to characterize it. Based on the measured characteristics the cells are sometimes sorted individually. The solution is injected in a capillary and the cells are passing in the probe volume one by one because of the diameter of the capillary forces the cell to be aligned in a single line. If a light illuminates one side of the capillary, there is an intensity drop on the other side when a cell is passing by. A small microfluidic canal can replace the capillary. Sometimes, a sheath liquid is injected with a hydrodynamic focusing to run laminarly on the side of the sample solution and further reduce the width and forcing cell alignment. Fluorescence spectroscopy offers better sensitivity and more information. The laser spot size is important to distinguish between two close cells when they are in a continuous flow. If they are encapsulated in a droplet, special care should be taken to not encapsulate two cells in the same droplet. If a sorter is added the techniques is called FACS (Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting). The same principle can be used for droplet sorting and is not limited to cell sorting [115].\n82 O.

These three steps are not necessarily consecutive and additional processing steps are often required for fluidic connections and, in fully integrated systems, for fluid injection with micropumps, for fluid control with microvalves and for sensors integration. The different types of microvalves and micropumps will be described in the first part of Chap. 4 and sensing/actuation techniques by mechanical, optical, electrical and magnetical ways are detailed in the following chapters of this book.\nThe choice of fabrication and surface functionalization technologies depends on many factors such as the substrate material used (polymer, glass, silicon, paper,…), the targeted application and its environment (ex vivo, in vivo, in vitro), the level of integration and of autonomy (portable systems), the technology readiness level (going from basic principles to real application product), the targeted cost, the need or not to get a disposable, re-usable, biocompatible and/or biodegradable system, etc.… Consequently, a very broad range of techniques have been developed and will be developed in the future for the micro/nanofabrication and biofunctionnalization of micro/nano biosystems. An exhaustive description is impractical but this chapter provides a critical analysis and a description of recent advances for a large selection of them.\nConcerning microfabrication, this chapter will describe the main direct machining and replication techniques, their issues and some solutions.

It may not often be clear to distinguish the fluidic plate from the cover plate, because both can have fluidic elements depending on the design of the device, or it may consist of several elements (Fig. 3.2).\nThe fabrication processes for micro/nano fluidic elements can be generally grouped into either direct machining of the structures on a workpiece or replicating the structures from a previously fabricated template.\nThe direct machining process includes mechanical cutting or forming, laser machining and chemical etching along with UV lithography for materials such as metal, silicon, glass, plastic or ceramic depending on the process.

Micro-shaping is efficient to machine micro-groove type of structures straight or circularly by reciprocation or turning of cutting tool or workpiece (Fig. 3.3). The groove can be machined to be order of 1 µm both in width and depth while the ridge between grooves can be machined in order of 1 µm in width, but tens of microns in depth depending on the shape of the groove. Although the micro-shaping is very efficient process for micro-groove, it is generally not available for the fluidic channel-like structures of irregular shape or path as shown in Fig. 3.4.\n92 Y. E. Yoo et al.\nThe fluidic channel of irregular shape or path not straight as in Fig. 3.4 can be machined through micro-milling process using a rotating cutting tool (Fig. 3.5), which is available to cut the channel-type structures as small as several tens of micrometer or embossed structures even in order of few micrometers [5, 6].\nMicro-milling depends on cutting speed or spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut etc. as process parameters. The quality of the surface and surface structures micro-milled is also affected by tool design (Fig. 3.6) such as cutting-edge radius, rake angle, helix angle of the flute, number of flute, etc. The optimal conditions on process or tool may be quite different for the micro-milling process due to reduced mechanical stiffness of the micro-milling tool, comparable size of the cutting-edge radius or grain of the workpiece material to the depth-of-cut, etc. Extensive researches on micro-milling have been reported [7–14]. In terms of the dimension of structure to be machined, the mechanical machining may be limited by the size of the cutting tool. Some commercial micro-milling cutting tools are available currently around 25 µm, therefore the fluidic channel less than 25 µm approximately is hard to machine directly on the device. The limit of the dimension of surface structure, however, may become smaller for embossed or positive surface structures if the cutting area is larger than the cutting tool (Fig. 3.7). The positive surface structures on the workpiece as in Fig. 3.7b may be damaged by the\n3 Micro/Nano Fabrication and Packaging Technologies for Bio Systems 93\ninteraction with the cutting tool [5, 6]. This may limit the dimension of the embossed surface structures to be machined. Fluidic channels smaller than the machining limit can be fabricated by replicating the surface structures using polymeric resin based on the embossed surface structures machined on a workpiece.\nMechanical machining process can be used for various materials such as brass, copper, carbon steel or plastic. One of the advantages of the mechanical machining process is that it can machine various surface structures directly on durable materials like metal, which is crucial to mass production of polymeric device by replication process such as injection molding. Also using the mechanical cutting process, the cross-section of the structures can be designed to have more diverse shapes or wider range of slope for the vertical wall. Moreover, the vertical wall of structure machined mechanically has generally positive slope, which is an advantage for easy releasing of the replica during the replication process (Fig. 3.8).\n94 Y.

The smooth PR layer turns into a structured layer with channels, pillars or chambers etc. by a developing process through which the PR is removed as patterned. Depending on the PR type, negative or positive, the PR is removed from different region (Fig. 3.9). For negative PR, the exposed region remains through the developing process because the negative PR becomes more stable by cross-linking reaction when being exposed to UV light or e-beam. For the positive PR, the exposed region is removed after developing due to the degradation during exposure. A transition region exists between the exposed and unexposed region due to chemical diffusion, optical diffraction or reflection, etc. The minimum dimension of the structure fabricated depends on the size of the transition region, which is determined by contrast of the photo-resist. The surface structures obtained after developing process can be used as a barrier layer to etch surface structures selectively on silicon or glass substrate, etc., a platform for fluidic device or a master to fabricate Ni-stamper used for injection molding.\n3 Micro/Nano Fabrication and Packaging Technologies for Bio Systems 95\nDry or wet etching process can be applied to fabricate the structures on the hard materials such as silicon, glass or metal using the PR pattern as a barrier. The cross-sectional shape of the structure is determined by the anisotropy of the process and material. As shown in Fig. 3.10, through wet etching of Si-wafer using a barrier layer with a square opening in several micrometers, the Si-wafer is etched to have a negative pyramid in order of micrometers with 70° of slope approximately rather than being etched into hemispherical structure due to the anisotropic crystal direction. The dry etching is an anisotropic process because a reactive gas impinges generally in normal direction to the substrate, so a highly anisotropic structure like deep channel or hole with straight vertical wall can be fabricated (Fig. 3.11).\nAlthough the surface structures may be fabricated directly on a device itself via the processes mentioned above, they can also be fabricated with additional processes on a master or template to replicate the structures repeatedly using polymeric materials. The Figs. 3.12 and 3.13 show one of processes for fabricating Ni stamper which is a typical durable nano/micro pattern template for injection molding. A PR master is fabricated first via UV lithography process using either of positive PR or negative PR and then Ni stamp is fabricated using nickel electroforming process explained in next section. From the viewpoint of the injection molding, the slop of side wall of the surface structure like channel is important because it affects greatly the productivity of the injection molding process or it even determines whether the structure can be injection molded or not. The channel of the PR master may have negative or positive slope of vertical wall depending on the PR type and the\n96 Y. E. Yoo et al.\nconditions for exposure to UV light because the PR is affected differently along the thickness direction due to the decrease of the UV light intensity, the diffusion of cross-link initiator, light scattering in the PR layer or reflection of the light on the substrate [15]. For example, the wider exposure along the depth due to reflection or scattering of the UV light at the bottom of the PR layer may cause negative slope of side wall with wider channel at the bottom. The negative slope of side wall may cause little issue for device itself. For master or stamp for replication, however, the negative slope results in severe failure during the fabrication due to locking on the stamper of the replica. The channel on the silicon or the glass substrate fabricated by dry etching may also have same negative slope of the side wall (Fig. 3.14). In addition to this, the dry-etched side wall has undulation in the depth direction and this undulation can also cause releasing issue of replica from the master or stamper (Fig. 3.14).\n3 Micro/Nano Fabrication and Packaging Technologies for Bio Systems 97"

PDMS is a material most widely used to fabricate a micro-fluidic device due to its low viscosity, low surface energy, good elasticity and very simple casting process. As shown in Fig. 3.16, the casting process with PDMS consists of mixing PDMS and curing agents, eliminating bubble, coating, curing and releasing the PDMS replica from the pattern master [16, 17]. The casting process can be done with ease in a laboratory without any complicate apparatus or process expert. Due to its low viscosity in liquid state and good elasticity in solid state, PDMS can fill the micro-structures well in the coating process and be released easily after being cured from the template. Moreover, the PDMS is excellent for sealing the fluidic channel of the device due to its good adhesion to many materials such as silicon, glass or plastic after oxygen plasma treatment which results in increasing of free radicals on the surface [18]. Also, it is convenient to apply interconnection port or tube for sample delivery or interfacing with other device because it is easy to punch a hole out or insert a port into the PDMS substrate [19–22].\nAs mentioned in this section, the PDMS casting process has many merits for micro-fluidic device fabrication at an early stage of development in laboratory. This casting process using PDMS, however, is only for fabrication of small number of device due to its poor productivity, durability or reproducibility, etc. The PDMS casting process requires quite long cycle time, typically longer than tens of minute.

As an alternative process, the UV curable resin can be coated on the pattern master first and a transparent film or plate is laminated on the coated layer followed by curing and releasing.

      "text" : "As the demand for mass production of the devices employing micro/nano structure increases, those devices are needed to be manufactured by injection molding process. The injection molding is a representative mass production process for plastics due to its excellent productivity with very short cycle time typically less than a minute or even several seconds for some commercial products. Injection molding process consists of four steps: filling, packing, cooling and releasing (Fig. 3.19). In the filling step, the polymer melt is injected into the mold cavity, where a stamp or a master is installed on the surface, and fills the intaglio structure on the stamp. In the releasing step, the injection-molded plate with micro/nano surface structures is mechanically released from the stamp after being solidified through cooling step. Because the polymer melt is hot (usually at least 200 °C) and the surface of the mold or stamp is relatively cold (usually less than 100 °C), the hot polymer melt starts to be cooled and solidified rapidly from the skin layer after it is injected into the mold cavity to contact the mold surface (Fig. 3.20). The rapid cooling and\n3 Micro/Nano Fabrication and Packaging Technologies for Bio Systems 101\nsolidification of the melt from the skin layer makes it very difficult to replicate the surface micro/nano structures, especially in the case of a high aspect ratio of structure (Fig. 3.20).\nIn addition to this incomplete filling of the hot melt, deformation or fracture of the micro/nano structures during the releasing step is another critical issue for injection molding of a device employing micro/nano structures. This deformation issue at the releasing step is caused by an interference between the stamp and plastic structures (Fig. 3.21). These two issues, incomplete filling and deformation of the structures, are most concerns in applying the injection molding for mass production of the device with micro/nano structures and have been studied by many research groups.\nFor incomplete filling problem, many researches have been continued to optimize the process or mold design to fill the micro/nano structures on mold surface completely with melt before the melt solidifies. Considering the key parameters for melt filling process such as melt temperature, mold temperature, injection speed and packing pressure, replication of the micro/nano structure is generally known to enhance under conditions of higher melt temperature, higher mold temperature, faster injection speed and higher packing pressure. Higher temperature of melt or mold delays the solidification of the polymer melt, which allows the melt to fill the tiny structures on the mold. Faster injection makes the melt to fill the surface structure more quickly before being solidified too. Higher packing pressure can make the melt to flow into the surface structures even after being solidified slightly. For smaller or higher aspect ratio of structures, higher temperature, higher pressure or faster injection speed are generally required to replicate the structures better.\n102 Y. E. Yoo et al.\nThese conditions, however, result in some negative effects such as longer cycle time or warpage of the substrate. For some micro/nano structures, it may be almost impossible to replicate the structure to the edge or corner precisely by optimizing conventional injection molding process using a mold set to a constant temperature during the process (Fig. 3.22). To overcome this issue, vario-themal injection molding processes, called rapid heat-and-cool injection molding process [25–27], are adapted for some devices with micro/nano structures [24, 28, 29]. In the vario-thermal injection molding process, the mold is heated up to the glass transition temperature of the molding material or higher temperature for filling step and cooled down below conventional mold temperature, for example 70 °C in case of PMMA, for cooling and releasing step. The key technology of the vario-thermal injection molding process is to heat up and cool down the mold very quickly to maintain the productivity of conventional injection molding process. Since the thermal mass of the mold is quite large, it takes too long time to heat up and cool down the entire mold system. So many molds for vario-thermal process employ a mold design isolating the surface with structures of the cavity thermally by separating the thin layer of the surface from the mold base [24, 25, 29], applying insulation layer beneath the surface or flow channels for heating and cooling close to the surface, etc. In Figs. 3.22 and 3.23, some injection molding results for micro/ nano structures are shown using vario-thermal injection molding process.\nAnother advantage of injection molding is that various commercial materials are available to meet diverse requirements for the device in terms of mechanical, chemical or optical performance. PMMA, PC, PS and COC are used mostly for injection molding of a plastic nano or micro-fluidic device, but other thermoplastic resins for injection molding and their variations are also available.\nBased on injection molding, the device can be designed and fabricated to have many functional elements such as port for tubing, load-bearing structures like rib or body, structures for assemble like welding bid, hole for bolting, snap-fit, etc. in addition to nano or micro-structures (Fig. 3.24).\n3 Micro/Nano Fabrication and Packaging Technologies for Bio Systems 103\nConsidering these advantages along with excellent productivity and cost competitiveness, the injection molding process is most promising manufacturing process for commercialization of nano or micro-fluidic devices."

To avoid this effect, coating allowing bioreceptors immobilization while reducing dramatically fouling phenomenon could be proposed [30].\nThe ultrasensitive biosensing methods are also combined to a high specificity provided by antibodies grafting.

In addition, conformational changes, reducing thereby proteins biological activity could also occur [39] (Fig. 3.27).\n3.3.2.5 Non Site Specific Covalent Immobilization\nIn this approach, bioreceptors are covalently bound to the immobilization support through accessible functional groups of exposed amino acids. Covalent bonds are mostly formed between side-chain exposing functional groups of proteins with chemical modified supports [e.g. Self-assembled monolayers (SAM)], resulting in an irreversible binding and producing a high surface coverage [32]. In addition, the immobilization process should be performed under physiological conditions to avoid proteins denaturation during their coupling on the chemically modified surfaces [39].

Since cysteines are not as abundant as lysines, proteins are less prone to random orientation rendering cysteine interesting for immobilization on sensor surfaces for instance [32].\n3 Micro/Nano Fabrication and Packaging Technologies for Bio Systems 109\nCarboxyl chemistry. Immobilization via carboxyl groups is also interesting opportunity considering the fact that aspartic and glutamic acid represent the major fraction of surface exposed groups on proteins. The coupling reaction could also involve EDC/Sulfo-NHS chemistry (Fig. 3.29).\n3.3.2.6 Site Specific Immobilization Strategies\nTo provide a better control of the protein orientation during the immobilization process, different site-specific immobilization techniques have been proposed. This approach could also be divided in noncovalent and covalent strategies.\nSite specific and non-covalent immobilization\nMost of these approaches exploit complementary affinity interactions between biomolecules. They rely on specific interactions occurring in biological process [39] such as biotine/streptavidin interactions or Protein A or G towards antibodies.\nPolyhistidine. This method is based on affinity between polyhistidine and divalent metal cations such as Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+. Recombinant proteins exhibiting a (His]6 tag at the C- or N-terminus can be immobilized on metal treated surfaces via a chelating agent such as nitriloacetic acid (NTA). This immobilization is reversible (Fig. 3.30). This strategy has been employed to develop an electrochemical biosensor, by immobilizing horse heart Cytochrome c on gold electrode surface [44].\nBiotin-(strept)Avidin interaction. This approach relies on one of the strongest noncovalent bonds. The specificity of the interaction allows uniform orientation of immobilized proteins. It is based on the interaction between strept(avidin) and biotin (Fig. 3.31). An example of application is given by Xia et al. [46]. They have developed a sensor surface, by immobilizing antibodies directed against Alzheimer using Biotin-(strept)]Avidin interaction. This non-covalent bonding permits repeated SPR measurements on the same surface and thereby improves the reproducibility of the methods and enhances the sample throughput. They have been able to measure Alzheimer disease biomarkers (amyloid peptides) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from AD patients.\nProtein A/Protein G-mediated Immobilization. The immobilization of antibodies by use of protein A/protein G relies on the specific interaction with the constant region [Fc Fragment] of the antibodies. Using this immobilization method ensures that the binding site of the antibody, located on the Fab variable region, remains available for specific antigen capture [32].\nDNA-Directed Immobilization. This strategy has been developed to convert DNA arrays into protein arrays using DNA hybridization. In this method, the complementary DNA conjugates to protein will be immobilized by specific interaction between the DNA grafted on the microarray and the DNA-protein conjugate. However, it is important to note that the incorporation of oligonucleotides into large proteins is still poorly developed [32].\n110 Y. E. Yoo et al.\nSite specific and covalent immobilization\nClick chemistry. In order to control an oriented and covalent coupling of a protein to a substrate, a unique chemical group or sequence could be introduced in the protein at a site-specific location. Several bio-orthogonal chemistries can lead to an oriented covalent immobilization of proteins. In this context, the ‘click chemistry’ concept becomes very popular. This chemistry rely on; (i) mild reaction conditions, (ii) insensitivity to oxygen and water, (iii) ability to use water as reaction medium, and the formation of a stable product under physiological conditions. In recent years several works include, copper or ring-strain catalyzed azide—alkyne cycloadditions, Staudinger-ligations, Diels—Alder cycloadditions, thiol—ene additions, and oxime formation [48].\nTargeting the Carbohydrate Moiety. Many glycoproteins, including antibodies, hormones, and enzymes, can be immobilized through their carbohydrate moiety without affecting their biological activity, since the carbohydrate region is generally located in areas not involved in specific activity. Moreover, coupling of antibodies\nvia carbohydrate moiety, located on the Fc region, was proven to enhance steric accessibility of the binding sites [32, 49]."

A range of groups have shown that by independently varying the molecular weight and chain density of PEG layers the protein resistance can be tuned accordingly. Indeed, a decrease of proteins adsorption is observed by increasing the grafting density or the chain length [30, 51, 52]. Layers with increasing grafting density pass from a single grafted chain (mushroom) regime to a brush regime with deformed polymer coils [30]. The effects of the polyethylene glycol (PEG) density, chain length, on proteins adsorption have been studied by using a complex mixture of proteins (lysozyme, human serum albumin (HSA), IgG and lactoferrin). For shorter chains a high density of PEG surface attachment sites is required to prevent proteins adsorptions. If the initial density of functional groups is low, the PEG chains should\n112 Y. E. Yoo et al.\nbe longer to obtain a protein resistance effect. The development of PEG coatings by attachment of PEGs from aqueous solution onto an amine interlayer (or an alternative equivalent amine base layer) provides a more convenient and versatile route for the fabrication of protein resistant PEG coatings [53]. High molecular weight PEG molecules grafted on SiO2 surfaces showed adsorption resistance of proteins from human serum evaluated with two different techniques: ellipsometry and QCM-D.\nIn another work, silane-PEGs with either carboxylic acid (silane-PEG-COOH, SPC) or biotin have been grafted on stainless steel surfaces (Fig. 3.32) [54]. Stainless Steel is a commonly used metal in industrial and medical settings, where it becomes exposed to organic and biological agents that may result, for example, in biofouling and microbial-induced corrosion. In this work the silanes-PEGs formed less than 10 Å thick overlayers with close to 90% surface coverage. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a coating by PEO stearate on a Dyneon THV microchip prevents the adsorption of proteins such as BSA and trypsin inhibitor and allow their analysis by electrokinetic mode [55].\nAnother approach rely on amphiphillic triblock PEO-bl-PPO-bl-PEO copolymers consisting of central hydrophobic propylene oxide (PPO) segment flanked by two hydrophilic PEO chains has been also evaluated on gold surfaces by SPR. An ultra-low adsorption of single protein solutions of fibrinogen, BSA, and complex mixtures of proteins has been obtained [56]. The same effect has been observed on stainless steel surface coated with the triblock copolymer a poly(ethylene oxide)poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO). The non-specific biofouling of fibronectine and biotine is reduced by 70%. Similar reductions in protein adsorption have been reported, for example, by Yang et al. [57] and Harder et al. [58]. Y. Yang and his colleagues coated stainless steel surface with a poly (ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO) triblock copolymer, and showed that the coated stainless steel surfaces were capable of significantly reducing the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) [57]. Another triblock copolymer structures composed by a central polypropylene sulfide flanked by two external PEG chains (PEG-bl-PPS-bl-PEG) grafted on gold surface exhibit anti-proteins adsorptions towards highly complex media such as human serum measured by SPR [59] (Figs. 3.22 and 3.33).\nAnother type of multidentate copolymeric has been proposed (Fig. 3.34). They are composed by three different monomers that have been randomly copolymerized in order to obtain a macro- molecule bearing grafted PEG side chains and providing a non-fouling property when exposed to human serum [61]."

This layer prevents protein adhesion on the surface. Several studies demonstrated the resistance of phosphorycholine (PC) SAM to proteins adsorption [64, 65]. In this work protein adsorption has been investigated on gold chip terminated by PC-SAMs by an SPR sensor. The results showed a dramatic decrease of two model proteins adsorption; Fibrinogen and BSA.

Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that the most common bacteria causing hospital infections are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococci and Escherichia coli [71, 72].\nBacteria could be considered as living colloids that interact easily with surfaces. This is due to their small size, low density, surface charge, and variable degrees of\ncell surface hydrophobicity. Their adhesion in surfaces could leads to a growth and production of an extracellular polymeric matrix and eventually to biofilm. Within this biofilm bacteria are more resistant to usual treatments by antimicrobial agents, which in turn increase health problems. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to prevent or control microbial attachment in the surface to avoid proliferation of adherent bacteria and biofilm formation. To prevent pathogenic biofouling on surfaces specific surface chemistries could be employed. The bacteria adhesion is influenced by the hydrophobicity and the charge of the external membrane of bacteria but also by the physico-chemical properties of the materials and its topography. Therefore, to prevent bacteria adhesion in surfaces by modifying surface chemistry two approaches could be proposed; repel or bacteria killing (Fig. 3.38). Repelling prevent bacteria attachment by steric hindrance or charged anionic polymers leading thereby to a repulsive electrostatic force between the negatively charged bacteria and the surface.\nKilling surface could be prepared by using polymers interacting with the bacteria membrane and cause its disruption or inactivate microbial cell activity [73–75]. Another approach relies on the incorporation of antibiotics on the polymers [76]."

The most widely described repelling polymers is the poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG). The bacteria repelling by PEG could be explained by several hypothesis such as; hydrophilicity, high polymer flexibility, large excluded volume, steric hindrance effect [53]. It has also been demonstrated that the longer is the PEG chain the higher is the resistance of the bacterial attachment [79]. PEG molecules bearing terminal hydroxyl, amino and sulfonates groups were tested against Escherichia Coli (E. Coli) and Staphyloccus Epidermidis (S. Epidermidis).\n3 Micro/Nano Fabrication and Packaging Technologies for Bio Systems 117\nResults obtained showed that the best repelling effect is obtained for both bacteria with PEG- terminated by sulfonates [79].\nSeveral authors also obtained a significant reduction of bacteria adhesion (70 to 95%) with poly[ethyleneterephtalate] (PET) surfaces modified by poly[ethylene oxide] (PEO) [80]. Glass and silica surfaces have also been modified with a covalent grafting of PEO brush. They showed that for the most hydrophobic strain the repelling is less effective [81, 82].

These polymers are able to interact with bacteria surfaces leading to their disruption [73].\nNon-natural cationics polymers\nThe first study has been proposed by Klibanov and coworkers. They developed antimicrobial surfaces which involve a covalent coating of amino-modified glass slides with long hydrophobic polycationic chains i.e. poly(4-vinyl-N-alkylpyridinium bromide). These derivatized surfaces become bactericidal since they kill up to 99% of deposited bacteria such as Tiller et al. [84]. The bactericidal mechanism of the surface-attached polycationic chains probably involves their penetration into the bacterial membranes, leading to cell damage and death [85].\nAnother approach to provide antimicrobial properties to medical device surfaces involves their silanization with quaternary ammonium-containing silane agents. Microfibrillated cellulose surfaces have been modified with alkoxysilane octadecyldimethyl [3-trimethoxysilylpropyl]-ammonium chloride rendering the material highly microbiocidal [86]. The quaternary ammonium functionalized surfaces have a high positive surface charge exerting thereby a strong adhesive force on negatively charged bacteria, presumably causing membrane leakage and cell death [87– 89]. These surfaces have been tested for antibacterial activity against S. Aureus, E. Coli and P. aeruginosa. Results obtained showed that more than 99% of S. aureus or E. coli bacteria initially exposed to the material were killed after a 24 h contact. The killing efficiency of these surface was found to be smaller toward P. aeruginosa [95%] compared to E. coli and S. aureus. A similar approach has been described recently when glass was modified by triethoxysilane terminated with a quaternary ammonium [90]. In this study, bacterial suspensions of S. Aureus or E. coli were sprayed at coated and uncoated slides. After 24 h, the number of colonies for both strains decreased; 92% and 71% for S. aureus and E. coli respectively.\nAnother important class of polymeric biocides is based on quaternary ammonium compounds. Recently, new random copolymers, where rather small fractions of reactive units such as carboxyl groups or epoxides are copolymerized with quaternary ammonium biocidal units, covalently attached or electrostatically bound onto the polymeric chains. Two series of copolymers, poly(4-vinylbenzyl chloride-co-acrylic acid), P(VBC-co-AAx), and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate-co-glycidyl methacrylate), P[SSNa-co-GMAx], were synthesized via free radical copolymerization and further modified by the incorporation of biocidal units either covalently (4-vinyl benzyl dimethylhexadecylammonium chloride) or electrostatically bound (cetyltrimethylammonium 4-styrenesulfonate, SSAmC16). Antimicrobial tests also revealed that the cross-linked membranes presented strong antimicrobial activity\n3 Micro/Nano Fabrication and Packaging Technologies for Bio Systems 119\nagainst S. aureus and P. aeruginosa [91]. Another study showed that hydrophilic monomer acrylic acid (AA), at low contents, with the covalently attached bacteriostatic group vinyl benzyl dimethylhexadecylammonium chloride (VBCHAM) in the copolymer P(AA-co-VBCHAM88), resulted in a high bacteriostatic activity against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis (6 log reduction in certain cases) [92]. This performance of the coating materials, evidencing their strong antimicrobial activity suggests that such materials are promising for antimicrobial applications [93].\nNatural cationics polymers\nChitosan is a polycationic polymer that can be employed alternatively to the non-natural polycationic polymers described above. Because of its non-toxicity, biodegradability, biocompatibility and antibacterial activity chitosan has attracted attention for application in the food and pharmaceutical industries [78]. Chitosan is the N-deacetylated derivative of chitin. Chitosan inhibits the growth of a wide variety of bacteria, including E. Coli and S. Aureus [94]. The exact mechanism of the antimicrobial action of chitin, chitosan, and their derivatives is still unknown, but it has been suggested that an interaction between positively charged chitosan molecules and negatively charged bacteria cell membranes could occur leading thereby to membrane disruption [94].\nBecause of their practical importance, microbiological applications of zwitterionic polymers and their derivatives have been studied in depth in recent years, resulting in newmechanistic understandings and novel molecular designs. Recently, a coating by chitosan–iron oxide on graphene oxide nanocomposite hydrogel has been developed. The chitosan–iron oxide coated graphene oxide nanocomposite hydrogel films displayed significant antimicrobial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, and also against the opportunistic dermatophyte Candida albicans [95]."

These fabricated micro/nano structures are open along the structures on the substrate, so a capping process with a cover plate is needed to seal the open structures to deliver the fluidic samples without overflow or leakage. Sealing the surface structures like fluidic channels or\nchambers depends on the size and shape of the structures, materials of the parts, bonding strength required, etc.\nFor mass production of device based on fluidic channel, injection molding using thermoplastic resin may be the most competitive process due to its excellent productivity, good dimensional accuracy and low cost, etc. Although injection molding process is now available for plastic substrate with nano or micro-structures on its surface, sealing the fluidic channel is still a big hurdle.\nThe major goal of sealing the fluidic channel is to bond the substrates hard, hermetically but still precisely to avoid deforming the channel. For the bonding of two substrates to seal the fluidic channel, the substrate mostly needs to be altered chemically or mechanically on the surface. Heating or applying a solvent softens the substrate especially in the skin region (Fig. 3.41), which results in inter-diffusion of the material and bonding at the interface of the substrates.\nA dry or wet adhesive may be used between the substrates for sealing. This adhesive bonding might be simple and fast to use, but have some issues like clogging by overflow of the adhesive during the coating or pressing process, misalign of the adhesive layer to the channel substrate or leakage path formed by porous structures in the adhesive layer (Fig. 3.42).\nClamping two substrates mechanically is another method for sealing of the fluidic channel device as shown in Fig. 3.43. It looks quite simple conceptually, but it is not easy to seal the fluidic channel hermetically due to the deformation of the substrate caused by point load for clamping.\nGenerally, more heating, solvent or adhesive is applied, higher strength of bonding can be obtained, but the surface structures are more deformed. The structures order of millimeters may not be affected significantly by the small amount of deformation or change at the interface (Fig. 3.44a). In case of sealing the structures less than hundreds of micrometers, however, the deformation or interference on the structures may be comparable to or even larger than the scale of the\n122 Y. E. Yoo et al.\nstructure itself (Fig. 3.44b). This significant influence on the channel requires that a very precisely controlled bonding method be used to enhance the bonding strength and the dimensional stability of the micro-structures at the same time, especially for polymeric substrates.\nBeside the issues mentioned above, restriction on heat, mechanical stress, UV radiation or solvent during the sealing process are additional issues on sealing of fluidic channel especially for devices employing biomaterials. Most biomaterials like antibody, other proteins or lipid are degradable or susceptible to losing their functionality when exposed to thermal, chemical or mechanical stress, UV radiation etc. Considering most bonding require at least one of processes such as heating, solvent treatment, pressing or UV exposure processes, it should be designed very carefully not to damage the biomaterials.\n3 Micro/Nano Fabrication and Packaging Technologies for Bio Systems 123\nAlthough diverse sealing methods have been proposed for nano or micro-fluidic device, it is still challenging task for many cases.

The bond strength for PDMS device depends on the characteristics of the PDMS such as the mixing ratio of the curing agent or the degree of cure [16, 98]. Higher mixing ratio of the curing agent makes the PDMS have lower elastic modulus and contact the other surface more conformally, which results in better adhesion. The partially cured PDMS can also contact the other surface better because the incompletely cured PDMS has lower elastic modulus compared to the fully cured one. Although PDMS/PDMS or PDMS/other surface can bond together well reversibly, PDMS’s or PDMS and some materials can also bond irreversibly when the surface is modified by surface treatment such as oxygen plasma. The oxidized surface of PDMS by exposing to oxygen plasma has silanol groups (Si–OH) temporarily, less than 30 min approximately in the air, and can form covalent siloxane bonds (Si–O–Si) when facing two surfaces tightly before silanol groups disappear [99, 100].

For this bonding method, the two parts are bonded through a 3rd material such as thermoset resin, UV curable resin or thermoplastic resin. The adhesive is coated to thin layer usually on the flat surface and cured or solidified after facing to press two substrates. The adhesive layer is cured or solidified in different ways depending on the material. The thermoset adhesive such as epoxy resin or thermo-reactive polymers is cured by heating up to curing temperature of the resin [101]. The UV curable resin is cured by UV light with appropriate wavelength to the resin much faster than the thermoset resin. These thermoset and UV curable resin are mostly liquid during the process to be coated on a substrate with a simple process. The thermoplastic adhesive layer previously coated on the substrate like thermoplastic film is heated up over the glass transition temperature of the adhesive and cooled down for re-solidification after facing and pressing two substrates. In general, the glass transition temperature of the thermoplastic adhesive is lower than of the substrate to reduce the deformation of the substrate or fluidic channel during the bonding process. The bonding process using adhesive is relatively simple, but one of the issues is to maintain the channel dimension precisely. The adhesive layer coated on a part is squeezed to flow by a compressive force on the layer for bonding. The squeezing flow of the adhesive during the bonding process may result in overflow into the micro-channel and blocking or narrowing the channel (Fig. 3.42). This blocking or narrowing the channel may depend on the thickness of the adhesive layer, channel size, viscosity of the adhesive, the design of the channel array or the surface structure, etc. Some solutions to reduce this blocking problem by the overflow have been proposed such as employing additional guiding channel for overflow adhesive [102]."

The bonding strength and sealing performance enhance as the substrate is heated to higher temperature and pressed with higher pressure. The dimensional stability of the fluidic channel and the substrate, however, is influenced negatively due to the larger deformation caused by lower modulus of the material at higher temperature and higher stress. The deformation of the fluidic channel or substrate and bonding strength increases for a same pressing condition as the temperature of the substrate increases and consequently the modulus of the thermoplastic decreases. Low temperature of substrate and low pressing pressure usually results in good dimensional stability, but poor bonding strength. High temperature and high\n3 Micro/Nano Fabrication and Packaging Technologies for Bio Systems 125\npressing pressure usually results in poor dimensional stability, but good bonding strength. Some studies tried to enhance the dimensional stability and bonding strength at the same time by balancing the temperature for the substrate and pressure for pressing. Some other methods have tried to enhance the bonding strength, sealing performance and dimensional stability such as matching thermoplastic substrates with different glass transition temperature (Tg), modifying the substrate to have varying Tg through thickness or activating the surface of the substrate to have functional chemical groups [103, 104].\nIt may be a good match to use a high Tg of fluidic channel substrate and a low Tg of cover plate with lower Tg for good dimensional stability and bonding strength when the temperature for the bonding process is set to between the glass transition temperatures of the fluidic channel substrate and the cover plate (Fig. 3.45).\nThe thermoplastic substrate can be pre-softened or have lower Tg at the skin layer by solvent, UV radiation or plasma treatment on the surface [103, 105], which may cause degradation of the polymer (Fig. 3.46). The thickness of low Tg layer by these treatments is reported to be very thin, 50 nm for example [105]. Using the substrate with thin low Tg or pre-softened layer on the surface, the process temperature can be set to near low Tg to restrict the deformation within skin layer, which may be negligible for the channel, without bulk deformation of the fluidic channel or substrate itself. The bonding strength for this bonding configuration still can be enhanced significantly due to the active diffusion in the softened low Tg layer even at low temperature and higher pressing pressure considering the high modulus of bulk substrate and the channels [106].\nSurface modifications to have functional group such as −COOH or −NH3, etc. by chemical reaction or plasma treatment also have been studied to enhance affinity of the two surfaces and bonding strength consequently. Some studies reported that the bonding strength enhanced compared to bare substrates, but not as much as bonding with softened skin layer by solvent exposure, etc. [104, 105].\nAs shown in Fig. 3.47, materials such as metal or carbon absorbing irradiation energy by laser or microwave and releasing heat are applied in skin region of the substrates to soften the skin region preferentially [107].\n126 Y. E. Yoo et al.\nIn a typical thermal bonding process by heating and pressing, the substrates are heated from the other surface of the facing surface while the skin region on the facing surface is needed to be softened. This configuration for bonding in the press results in excessive heating on the back surface of the substrate (Fig. 3.48). If the bonding surface is set to required temperature, then the back surface of the substrate will have higher temperature and severe deformation. This will become worse for a thicker substrate or a substrate with lower thermal conductivity. As an alternative process, heating the substrate from the facing surface may be effective approach to heat and soften the skin region locally (Fig. 3.49)."

The softening also depends on the phase of the solvent (liquid or vapor), exposure time or temperature when applied to the surface. If a thermoplastic substrate is exposed to a reactive solvent to the thermoplastic in liquid phase for long time, the substrate may be softened too deeply, resulting in severe deformation during the pressing process. When the surface of the fluidic channel is exposed to the solvent, the fluidic channel might be clogged due to the swelling of the channel surface by the solvent and this clogging may become worse for the channel in smaller scale [108]. The bonding processes using solvent have\n128 Y. E. Yoo et al.\nbeen studied in various way to enhance the dimensional stability and bonding strength. To prevent channel deformation due to excessive solvent, a solvent less reactive with the substrate was selected to avoid softening the substrate too much [105]. In the other study [109], cyclohexane vapor was used to reduce the penetration of the solvent into the COC(Cyclic Olefin Copolymer) substrate and deformation consequently. Additional DUV exposure thereafter induces a cross-linking reaction in the softened layer at the interface which results in higher bonding strength. The fluidic channel was filled with sacrificial material like wax before being exposed to solvent not to contact with solvent [110]. After bonding two substrates, the wax was eliminated through the channel by heating the substrates over melting temperature of the wax.\nAnother issue on solvent bonding is chemical contamination because the biological substances in the fluidic channel may lose their functionalities due to the solvent [111]."

      "text" : "Ultrasonic welding is one of bonding processes widely used for plastic parts. Ultrasonic welding uses high frequency vibration (15 * 70 kHz, typically 20 kHz for plastic welding) generated by piezoelectric transducer and transmitted to the target part via booster and horn. The ultrasonic welding equipment consists of a generator, a converter (piezoelectric transducer or similar one), a booster and a horn as shown in Fig. 3.50.\nThe transmitted vibration energy to the workpiece is concentrated into a structure, called welding bid, for localized melting at the contact point (Fig. 3.51). The welding bid is usually designed to have sharp edges to contact counterpart at only restricted areas and to be melted locally by friction or plastic deformation of the welding bid. The size and shape of the welding bid are designed by considering the thickness of welding layer or the volume for melt at the interface with the counterpart for welding. Typical size of the welding bid for conventional plastic part is in the order of hundreds of micro-meters, but this is too large for direct welding on micro-structure (Fig. 3.52).\nFor many micro-fluidic devices, many of flow channels are less than a hundred of micro-meter but the land or ridge for the channels is larger than a millimeter. Therefore, for most ultrasonic welding structure for micro-fluidic, the welding bid contacts the macro region to be welded and cover the micro-channels. If the ridge of the channel is too small to apply welding bid in order of hundreds micrometer, then the welding bids are required to be applied to other regions, practically apart from the channels, on the device (Fig. 3.53). In this case, the channels are sealed by mechanical contact between the channel ridge and cover plate, which may cause leak in case of incomplete contact due to a deflection of the plate or difference in\n3 Micro/Nano Fabrication and Packaging Technologies for Bio Systems 129\nheight of the ridge, etc. As shown in Figs. 3.51 and 3.53, too large welding bid results in a thick melting layer and consequently larger channel or gap between the cover plate and the ridge. Too small welding bid may result in insufficient bonding strength or channel collapse due to severe deformation of the ridge.\n130 Y. E. Yoo et al."

However, their miniaturization is finally desirable to get fully integrated micro/nano biosystems that are portable and more autonomous. As detailed in Sect. 4.2 of this chapter, a large variety of microvalves and micropumps were proposed and developed for this purpose.\nThe development of atomic force microscopy and of micro/ nano-electromechanical systems (M/NEMS) in the last three decades clearly demonstrated the high sensitivity of micro/nano-mechanical structures such as cantilever micro/nano-beams, micro/nano-bridges, membranes… and of acoustic microdevices to added mass, to mechanical stress or/and to tiny forces. Their potential for biodetection began to be investigated around year 2000 and some typical examples of biomechanical detection are reviewed in the last part of Sect. 4.2.\nMicro/nano bio system can also take benefit of mechanics for cell manipulation, sorting and analysis owing to the similar size of fluidic microchannels and of cells, and to the variability of cell density and mechanical properties.

      "text" : "Microvalves can be divided in three major types: active (internal and external), and passive. Active microvalves have in common an actuating element (the different kinds are analyzed below) to stop or allow the flow. Active microvalves can be classified depending on whether the actuator is external (e.g. built-in modular or pneumatic) or the actuator is integrated on the microfluidic chip using MEMS-based technologies (e.g. magnetic, electric, piezoelectric or thermal actuators). Internal valves offer high performances, but also high complexity and fabrication costs. In contrast, external valves are cheaper and simpler, but the final solution is bulky, not viable for miniaturization. Passive valves, sometimes called check-valves, do not include actuation, they open to forward pressure showing a diode-like behavior.\nMicrovalves’ applications include flow regulation, on/off switching and sealing of liquids, gases or vacuum. The desired characteristics of an ideal microvalve include no leakage flow, reduced dead volume, reduced power consumption, large pressure resistance, fast response time, insensitivity to contamination, ability to operate both with liquids and gases, low complexity, low fabrication cost, and disposability [4]. Unfortunately, up to date there is no valve technology or design that simultaneously satisfies all these requirements. Therefore, the most appropriate type of microvalve will change according to the demands of a specific application.\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 141"

This approach suffers, logically, from difficulties in miniaturization, given the fact that additional components are required, like air/vacuum pumps or solenoids. However, external microvalves exhibit no leakage flow even at high input pressures and excellent performances in on/off switching or sealing.\nTwo main categories can be distinguished, namely modular and pneumatic external valves. Modular external microvalves include built-in [5] or rotary configurations [6]. Microvalves actuated by an external pneumatic system are distinguished between membranes [7] and in-line [8].\nQuake et al. presented an in-line pneumatic valve system consisting of a crossed-microfluidic PDMS channel block, sealed to glass or elastomer substrate, as shown in Fig. 4.1a. An actuation channel is filled by pressurized gas allowing a thin membrane to deflect and close the bonded fluidic channel. Two different configurations have been demonstrated and compared, as presented in Fig. 4.1b, c.\nThe push-down configuration (Fig. 4.1b) consists of 100 µm wide and 10 µm thick channels with a minimum actuation pressure of 40 kPa to seal the fluidic channel [8]. The second valve generation, push-up configuration (Fig. 4.1c), allows an increase fluidic channel height up to 55 µm, and a lower valve actuation pressure of 15 kPa [9].\nThe push-up membrane was further improved by Pandolfi and Ortiz. They demonstrated that the channel closure can be assisted by out-of-plane buckling of the membrane caused by controlled chemical swelling in silicone oil. This strategy allowed them to decrease the actuation pressure down to 8 kPa [10].\n142 L. G. Villanueva et al."

      "text" : "As opposed to the previous type of valves, it is also possible to have the actuation mechanism integrated on-chip. In those cases, the moving component is usually a membrane. Various actuation principles can be adopted to actuate mechanical moving parts and the actuators are integrated in the valve structure itself.\nMechanical active microvalves have two main disadvantages: unavoidable leakage flow and relatively high cost due to their complicated structure. While leakage flow is a critical feature for on/off switching applications, it is less critical for flow regulation. Therefore, micromachined active microvalves are usually preferred for gas or selected liquid regulation, even though numerous on/off switching applications have been reported [11]. Due to their elevated cost, internal active microvalves are mainly reusable and are usually implemented in non-disposable devices.\nThe following paragraphs provide a brief analysis of mechanical active microvalves, classified according to their actuation principle. Bear in mind that we do not intend to do a thorough review of these actuation principles, just introducing them succinctly.\nElectromagnetic\nA wire carrying a current in the presence of a magnetic field will experience the Lorentz force ~Fem ¼ ~I ~B L, where ~Fem is the electromagnetic force, ~I is the current through the wire, ~B is the magnetic field and L is the wire length. The magnitude of the force, ~Fem\n, scales down with dimensions / la, with a between 1 and 2, if we consider an external magnetic field, and depending on whether we take constant current, voltage or power [12]. In any case, this scaling shows that for very small sizes the force is compromised.\nElectromagnetic microvalves operate at low voltages and are able to generate large actuation forces (see Fig. 4.2a). However, electromagnetic actuators require an external magnetic field, thus rendering them difficult to miniaturize, even though in some cases they have been shown to be integrated [13]. As current needs to be sent through the wires, electromagnetic microvalves exhibit high power consumption and high heat dissipation [14].\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 143\nIn 1979 Terry et al. proposed the first active micromachined valve, using a solenoid plunger, which was physically connected to a 100 nm thick nickel membrane. The normally closed microvalve constituted a component of an integrated gas chromatography system [15].\nElectrostatic\nElectrostatic actuation is based on the Coulomb attraction force between oppositely charged plates. Assuming a system with two parallel plates and a voltage difference (V) is set between them, the force takes the form: Fes ¼ 12 e0erAV 2\nx2 where e0er is the dielectric constant, A the electrode area, and x the electrode spacing. Due to the scaling of the electrostatic force, Fes / l0, the miniaturization of electrostatic actuators is much simpler than electromagnetic ones.\nIn electrostatic microvalves, one of the electrodes to give rise to the force is typically located on the membrane, whereas the second one is typically placed on the substrate, within the microchannel to be closed or opened, as presented in Fig. 4.2b. This type of valves has a fast response time and low power consumption in the order of 1 mW, since almost no current flows through the system. The main limitation is the small achievable displacements, usually in the order of few micrometers.\nModifications of the basic schematic shown in Fig. 4.3 have been proposed in several ways. The efficiency of the system can be improved using S-shaped membranes that move back and forth (laterally) instead of up and down [16]. Different materials have been used for the fabrication of the actuation membrane: flexible materials as polymide [17], requiring lower actuation voltages, and rigid silicon membrane [18, 19], preferred for high pressure control.\nPiezoelectric\nPiezoelectricity is the property of a material to respond with a mechanical deformation ðejÞ to an applied voltage. We consider a piezoelectric layer of width wPZE, thickness tPZE, Young’s modulus EPZE and piezoelectric coefficients dij. Applying an electric voltage across the thickness of the piezoelectric layer (V) causes a deformation in the piezoelectric layer and therefore a force (assuming a structure working in pure elongation), FPZE ¼ EPZE d33 wPZE LPZE VtPZE and scales as l. Although large force and fast response time are achieved through piezoelectric actuators, small strokes and complexity in the fabrication are challenging issues.\nThe drawback of small strokes has been overcome via different alternatives as the hydraulic amplification of the piezoelectric deflection [20], stacked piezoelectric\n144 L. G. Villanueva et al.\ndisks [21] or piezo bimorphs, presented in Fig. 4.2c (i.e. structures working in flexion instead that elongation) [22, 23].\nFor example, Rogge et al. proposed a hydraulic transmission system, which is able to translate a small-scale deflection of the piezodisk into a larger movement of a valve membrane, showing an increase of the membrane displacement up to 25 times, achieving a valve stroke of 50 µm [24].\nThermal\nThermo-mechanical actuation is based on the expansion caused by a change in temperature in either the mechanical structure (bimetallic effect and shape memory alloys) or its surroundings (thermopneumatic). In general, thermal actuation provides large strokes and large actuation forces, but this comes with a slow response time and a high power consumption.\nBimetallic\nBimetallic actuation, schematically represented in Fig. 4.3a, is based on the difference of thermal expansion coefficients of multiple materials bonded together. When a multilayer stack of dissimilar materials, not necessarily metals, is subjected to temperature changes DTð Þ, thermal stresses ðri) are induced in each material: ri ¼ Ei ai DT , where Ei is the Young’s modulus of material i. This stress distribution translates into bending of the structure [25]. Among thermal microvalves, bimetallic actuated ones exhibit the lowest power consumption.\nShape Memory Alloy (SMA)\nShape memory alloy (SMA) actuated microvalves make use of the shape memory effect in SMAs such as Au/Cu, In/Ti and Ni/Ti. These materials can be easily deformed at room temperature, but they recover their pre-deformed shape when heated up above a phase transition temperature, which is characteristic of each material. This phase transition results in mechanical deformation that is used for actuation [26], as shown in Fig. 4.3b.\nAs an example, we can take the case of Kohl et al. who developed normally open gas microvalves actuated by microfabricated SMA thin films of NiTiPd. The main components are a polyimide membrane, a spacer and the SMA device. They demonstrate control of pressure differences below 250 kPa, corresponding to a gas flow of 360 mL min−1 with a stroke of about 20 µm [27]. Thermopneumatic\nThermopneumatic actuation is based on thermally induced volume change and/or phase change of fluids sealed in a cavity with at least one compliant wall (Fig. 4.3c). For liquids, the thermally induced pressure increase is related to the thermal expansion coefficient, and the temperature increase. Since the actuation force is given by Ftp ¼ P A, the thermopneumatic force is related to the surface A of the moving membrane, thus it scales as the square of the size. Thermopneumatic actuation combined with soft materials is very promising to achieve large actuation force and large stroke, with however a large power consumption. An example is reported from Takao et al. [28], presenting a thermo-pneumatic in-channel PDMS\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 145\nmicrovalve applicable to integrated blood test system. The microvalve consists of two separated chambers and a PDMS diaphragm actuated by pneumatic pressure controlled by an integrated Au microheater.\nBistable\nAs opposed to what we have seen till now, this refers more to a design choice, rather than to an actuating mechanism. Power consumption is one of the major factor of interest when choosing the suitable microvalve for a specific application. Any of the actuation mechanisms shown till now might need to have a continuous application of power to keep the microvalves open or closed. This limitation can be overcome through the design of bistable structures that only require power during the transition between two stable positions, regardless of the actuation principle (Fig. 4.4).\nBistable microvalves have been reported using thermal buckling of membranes [29], pneumatic switching actuation [30], and combination of multiple actuation principles [31, 32].\nAn example of thermal buckling is reported by Goll et al. [29]. The authors use a polyimide membrane which buckles due to a compressive stress induced by thermal treatment and mechanical loading. Because of the bistability of the microvalve, only a short pressure rise and a short pressure drop are obtained by controlling an electric current through a resistive heater in the actuator chamber."

      "text" : "While active valves control flow rate through pressure differences and have complex structures due to their various actuation principles, passive valves (check valves) only open to forward pressure and have simple structures, showing diode-like characteristics. The valving efficiency of passive valves is relatively poor, since the performance of these check valves depends on input pressure. This lack of efficiency results in leakage flows at low pressure. Despite this drawback,\n146 L. G. Villanueva et al.\nmost passive microvalves are incorporated as check valves in inlets and outlets of reciprocal displacement micropumps. The mechanical moving component can be constituted of a cantilever (flap type), a membrane or a ball, as shown in Fig. 4.5.\nIn case of disposable microfluidics, irreversible burst valves are highly preferred, due to their single-use nature and simple fabrication [33].\nFlap and Membrane\nFlap andmembrane valves usually have amechanical component that forms a seal with the valve seat, allowing fluid flow only in one direction and preventing reverse flow.\nVoldman et al. successfully developed a silicon flap microvalve, placed at the end of a silicon nozzle, to control biochemical reactions of two compounds [34]. However, the use of a rigid material as silicon can represent a limiting factor, since stiction between the moving parts can occur, and even slight contaminations can affect the integrity of the sealing. Such limitations can be overcome by the use of soft materials like PDMS or hydrogels, which are not only flexible, but also cheaper and biocompatible [35]. On the other hand, PDMS, polymide and hydrogels tend to leak liquid and gases due to their high permeabilities. Therefore, parylene is often chosen as valve material, because of its low permeability to liquids and low Young’s modulus. As an example, Kim et al. reported in [36] the fabrication of two different configurations of parylene micromechanical check valves: cantilever-type flap valve and bridge-type membrane valve. In both cases, one valve controls the flow in one direction, while the other controls the flow in the opposite direction.\nThe main difference between the flap-type and the membrane-type configuration lies in the relative movement between the fluid and the mechanical part of the valve. For the cantilever-type flap valve, the flow going through the valves produces rotating motion of the valves and induces turbulences in the flow around the valve opening ends. For the bridge-type valve, the flow can go through the valve with a symmetrically distributed velocity profile.\nBall\nBall valves allow the control of a unidirectional flow. The working principle is very similar to flap and membrane valves, but the mechanical moving element in this case is a microsphere.\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 147\nBall valves historically find their main application in heart valve prosthesis. In 1954, Hufnagel et al. treated patients with aortic insufficiency with insertion of an acrylic ball valve into the descending aorta [37], while in September 1960, Starr-Edwards performed the first successful mitral valve replacement using a caged-ball valve [38, 39].\nMiniaturization of these valves allowed their use as passive check valves in micropump structures, as will be described in Sect. 4.2.2 Mechanical Micropumps.\nIn-line Polymerized Gel Mobile Structure\nIn-line polymerized gel microvalves are a particular example of ball valves. They use in situUVor visible light induced photopolymerization to create gel plugs and interrupt liquid flows, working as diode-like mechanical components (Fig. 4.6a and b).\nPhotopolymerization is induced by selectively exposing the chip to UV light, in order to define mobile pistons inside the microchannels. After UV exposure, the unwanted polymer can be flushed away with organic solvents while sealing or confining surfaces prevent the moving part from flowing out when pressure is applied. The main advantage of this technique is the simple fabrication that does not require any sacrificial material or mechanical assembly.\nHasselbrink et al. used photopolymerization of Teflon-like polymer to fabricate micropistons in microfludic channels, demonstrating sealing pressures up to 30 MPa [40]. Another example is given by Seidemann et al. who fabricated SU8 photoepoxy triangular check valve, anchored to a S-shaped spring [41]."

They find application in many different fields such as microfluidic transport, microelectronic cooling, micropropulsion for space exploration, dispensing therapeutics, and single cells monitoring [42–45].\n148 L. G. Villanueva et al.\nIn essence, pumps are smart combination of valves (both active and passive) that put fluid in motion. Pumps may be classified based on the applications they serve, the materials from which they are constructed, the liquids they handle, and even their orientation in space.\nWe adopt here a more basic classification system according to the way by which micropumps induce fluid flow and pressure [44, 46]. This classification is thus related to the pump itself and is independent of any consideration external to the pump or even to the materials from which it is constructed. Under this classification criterion, all pumps are divided into two major categories: dynamic micropumps and displacement micropumps.\nDisplacement micropumps exert pressure forces on the working fluid through one or more moving boundaries. Mechanical microvalves are typically used as a constitutive part of displacement pumps.\nDynamic micropumps continuously add energy to the working fluid in order to increase its pressure directly or indirectly through its momentum. Momentum added to the fluid in a displacement pump can subsequently be converted into pressure by the action of an external fluidic resistance.\nSeveral parameters need to be taken into account in order to optimize the micropump performances. Some of them are reliability, power consumption, cost, miniaturization, biocompatibility, and efficiency. This latter concept, pump efficiency g, is defined as the ratio of the power delivered to the fluid by the pump Ppump and the power required to drive the pump actuator Pactuator. In an ideal pump, Ppump and Pactuator are identical as no losses exist. In a real pump three sources of losses can be distinguished: fluid leakage losses (volumetric efficiency gV ), frictional losses (mechanical efficiency gM), and losses due to imperfect pump construction (hydraulic efficiency gH). Therefore, the total pump efficiency can be written as follows: g ¼ gVgMgH ¼ Ppump=Pactuator [42]."

      "heading" : "4.2.2.1 Displacement",
      "text" : "Displacement micropumps can operate in a periodic or aperiodic manner. Periodic displacement micropumps give a continuous motion to the fluid, and can be divided into reciprocating and rotary types, depending on the nature of movement carried out by the pressure-producing mechanical element. Aperiodic displacement pumps do not typically involve the movement of any mechanical parts and so they are not going to be studied here, but the interested reader can further read about them in [44].\nReciprocating: Diaphragm\nThe majority of reported micropumps are reciprocating displacement pumps in which the moving surface is a diaphragm, also called membrane pumps or diaphragm pumps. Alternatively the moving mechanical element can also be constituted by a piston [44].\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 149\nThe basic components of diaphragm pumps are shown in Fig. 4.7, and are a pump chamber, an actuator mechanism or driver and two passive check valves. Richter et al. have demonstrated that the maximum pressure pmax produced by reciprocating displacement micropumps is inversely dependent of the fluid compressibility j, consequently these devices are generally capable of achieving higher pressures with liquid-phase working fluids better than with gas phase [47]. Complications may arise due to the presence of air bubbles in the working fluid, which would increase its compressibility, decreasing pmax. Therefore, susceptibility to bubbles is a significant problem for reciprocating displacement micropumps.\nThe most common method for fabricating micropumps is micromachining of silicon combined with glass bonding layers. The first silicon micropump was proposed by Van Lintel et al. [48] in 1988, and consisted of a single-chamber reciprocating displacement silicon micropump, driven via piezoelectric disk actuator placed on top of a glass diaphragm. While most micropumps presented in literature have a single pump chamber, a few micropumps have been reported with multiple chambers. One example is given by Smith et al. who fabricated a reciprocating displacement micropump with three chambers in series, piezoelectrically actuated and requiring no valve to rectify the flow [49]. Also, Shoji et al. proposed a reciprocating displacement microvalve with two pump chambers arranged in parallel, showing a continuous and rippleless flow in the pump output [50].\nActuation within the pump has been reported to be of many different types, including every single case analyzed in the previous paragraph. Thus, the same advantages and limitations discussed for microvalves are still valid for micropumps.\nPump diaphragm material must be chosen according to the frequency range of actuation and fluid properties. For micropumps driven by low frequency and/or low force actuators, a low elastic modulus diaphragm material, such as silicone rubber, generally allows to maximize the pump stroke volume, thus positively impacting device performances [51]. However, the high permeability of soft polymers to liquids may be a concern depending of the application. On the other hand, the fast\n150 L. G. Villanueva et al.\nmechanical response of a stiff diaphragm generally yields the best performance in case of drivers operating at high frequencies. For example silicon and glass are the most common diaphragm materials in piezoelectric driven reciprocating displacement micropumps.\nRotary\nA small number of microscale displacement pumps employ rotary elements such as gears or vanes for generating fluidic flow. Based on different design concepts, rotary micropumps make use of either viscous forces or pressure forces to carry out the pumping action [52].\nAshouri et al. proposed a novel high-efficiency prototype microfluidic pump that uses magnetic properties of a ferrofluid in both pumping and valving mechanisms, presented in Fig. 4.8. A cylindrical magnetic piston covered by ferrofluid functions as a revolving element which sweeps the perimeter of the cylindrical pumping chamber. The piston is externally actuated by a motorized off-center permanent magnet. Ferrofluid is used to cover the gaps between the magnetic piston and the channel walls, also serves as a separating plug between the inlet and the outlet of the chamber preventing recirculation of the pumped fluid inside the chamber. This novel revolving piston design eliminates the need for an inlet valve, while a ball passive valve is placed at the outlet of the pump [53].\nKey issues for such pumps include ensuring the immiscibility of the ferrofluidic plug and liquid being pumped, degradation of the ferrofluid over time, and the need to incorporate an external controller for the magnet.\nAnother interesting example of rotary displacement micropump is the one proposed by Chou et al. They used a microfabricated rotary pump to demonstrate active mixing of biological entities, overcoming their slow diffusion process [54]. Because microfluidic devices operate at low Reynolds number, many fluidic\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 151\noperations are limited by diffusion in laminar flow. An active mixing apparatus takes much smaller area and thus saves the amount of time required and of precious reagents used, compared to a long narrow channel."

Momentum added to the fluid in a displacement pump can then be converted into pressure by the action of a change in the fluidic resistance. These pumps generate a continuous flow without pulsation, and are simpler to fabricate than displacement micropumps. Typically, dynamic micropumps have no mechanical moving parts, and are based on non mechanical physical principle, which does not belong to the intent of this paragraph [44]. However, dynamic micropumps based on ultrasonic flexural plate waves and surface acoustic waves have been reported, which allow for directed flow in simple microchannels with no valves or other moving parts.\nAcoustic\nThe use of mechanical actuation for fluidic pumping requires the use of sophisticated and often costly fabrication processes to develop the device and its micromachined moving parts.\nTovar and Lee demonstrated a novel and simple method for pumping and mixing fluids within a microfluidic system using an acoustic energy source, namely a piezoelectric (PZT) buzzer. Such device, termed lateral cavity acoustic transducer (LCAT), is based on the principle of acoustic microstreaming: air bubbles trapped in lateral cavities adjacent to the microfluidic channels are excited by an external acoustic field, which causes the air/liquid interface to vibrate. This energy is then passed to the bulk liquid and produces a net force perpendicular to the bubble interface and out the end of the cavity, as shown in Fig. 4.9. The pumping flow rate generated by the cavities is controlled through adjusting the amplitude and frequency at which the PZT is driven and also by determining the optimal bubble\n152 L. G. Villanueva et al.\ntrapping angle. The maximum flow rate was obtained with an angle of 15° between the lateral cavity and the microfluidic channel [55].\nMixing of beads and cells into downstream microchannels has also been demonstrated by simply placing the air bubble cavity perpendicular to the microfluidic channel, which results in a drag force deflecting the particle in the direction perpendicular to the bulk flow [56].\nThe main advantage that the LCAT device has over other pumping methods is the ease of operation and fabrication. However, the classical configuration of closed channel networks can present several disadvantages. In pumping biological molecules and cells there is concern over reagent loss by adhesion to the wall, and clogging of small channels. Also, the pressure required to move a liquid confined into a microfluidic channel scales inversely with the channel dimension [57]. This means that the power of the pumps has to be increased by the same factor the channel size is reduced, which complicates the scaling and the integration into a portable system.\nAn alternative to the common closed microfluidic networks is given by the surface acoustic waves (SAW) technology [43], that will be discussed in more detail in the following paragraph, and that can be applied to fluidic volumes from few picoliters up to several microliters. A representative example of SAW microfluidic actuation is provided by Guttenberg et al. [58], who proposed a microfluidic device for on-chip PCR, operating at a planar open surface. In such device the fluid is transported on a piezoelectric substrate, and in order to prevent evaporation of the PCR reagents at high temperatures the fluidic sample is enclosed in droplets of mineral oil that can be ultrasonically actuated along the surface plane. Actuation of small droplets on the surface of a SAW chip is caused by the effect of acoustic streaming. This phenomenon appears when intensive sound fields are travelling through a liquid. The viscosity of the medium attenuates the amplitude of the acoustic waves during its propagation, which leads to a pressure gradient in the liquid. If the gradient is large enough, the fluid starts to move in the same direction as the sound wave. The RF power threshold for the movement strongly depends on the contact angle of the droplets. Therefore, the distribution and the motion of the fluid on the surface is controlled mainly by the surface free energy, which makes surface contamination a sensitive concern in SAW microfluidic actuation."

Their fabrication relies on the standard semiconductor processing techniques, enabling for efficient batch production. Nanomechanical biosensors are usually cantilever-shaped, but can also include doubly-clamped beams, membranes, and SAW or BAW (bulk acoustic waves) devices.\nRobust and well-established electrical and optical sensors still dominate the field of biological detection in terms of market share. However, in the past two decades\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 153\nMicro and Nano Mechanical systems (N/MEMS) have been receiving a lot of attention at the research level. The main reason for this development of N/MEMS in life-science applications (BioMEMS) has been to address the mechanical nature of many fundamental biological processes. A clear example is cell mechanical properties such as stiffness or viscoelasticity, which represent a valid diagnostic biomarker for several pathologies like cancer, malaria and sickle cell anemia among others [59, 60]. In addition, continuous advances in micro- and nano-fabrication techniques allow the size of mechanical devices to be comparable to the size of some biomolecules, thus resulting in a highly sensitive mechanical response and in outstanding mass resolution [61–63]. Furthermore, N/MEMS can exhibit extremely high mechanical compliance. This enables the measurement of pN forces generated by biological interactions, by translating them into a mechanical displacement, enhancing force responsivity [64, 65].\nMechanical biosensors can operate in static or dynamic mode, depending on whether quasi-static deflection or shifts in the resonance frequency are monitored and thus related to the biological event under study."

      "text" : "Static-mode biosensors are usually cantilever shaped and typically measure surface stress or surface forces induced by biological entities such as single-base DNA, pathogens or protein biomarkers [66, 67]. Other approaches consider the detection of forces at the tip of cantilevers, using a configuration similar to that of an atomic force microscope (AFM) [68, 69].\nCommon surface stress biosensors consist of microcantilevers with one active side functionalized to attach a monolayer of receptors that exhibit high affinity to the target molecules, while the opposite passive side is inert. The devices are placed in a fluid cell where the sample solution is delivered. The binding of target molecules to the receptors causes a surface stress change that induces a quasi-static deflection of the cantilever (see Fig. 4.10).\n154 L. G. Villanueva et al.\nThe stress induced cantilever deflection is real time monitored via optical or electrical displacement detection methods. The surface stress variation can be evaluated through the change of curvature the microcantilevers undergo when the sample solution flows over them. According to the Stoney’s equation Dj ¼ 6 1 mð ÞEh2 Dr, where j is the curvature, m and E the Posson’s ratio and the Young’s modulus of the material respectively, h the thickness of the cantilever and Dr the surface stress change. The Stoney’s equation is only valid under the assumption of plates with unclamped edges. Therefore, in order to take into account the clamped edge of microcantilevers configuration, a correction factor needs to be considered [70, 71].\nThese devices have shown remarkable label-free capabilities [72], however deflection is highly susceptible to non-specific binding, temperature and flow fluctuations. Very stable flows, together with differential measurements of non-functionalized cantilever help to partially circumvent spurious deflections [67]."

      "text" : "Dynamic mode biosensors are mechanical devices which vibrate close to the resonance frequency of the device fr proportional to the square root of the ratio between stiffness k and mass m of the structure. An analyte landing or binding on the resonator surface induces a change of its mass (and stiffness [73]), which is transduced into a shift of the resonance frequency, as seen in Fig. 4.11.\nMicro- and Nano-mechanical resonators have demonstrated great capabilities in life-science label-free mass sensing applications, such as detection of viruses and single molecules [3, 63, 74]. Mass responsivity is defined as the change in resonance frequency due to a change in mass. < ¼ @fr@m 12 frm [3, 75]. In order to achieve the highest mass responsivity, one can reduce the mass or increase the\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 155\nfrequency (or both). The minimum detectable mass by a mechanical resonator is given by the ratio between the noise and the responsivity, and it is typically given by: dmmin dfmin< ¼ 12 dfminfr m: Using Robbins formula [76], we can then write: dmmin 12m 1Q NoiseSignal : Thus, it is clear that a large quality factor, Q; is necessary to optimize the sensing performance. Q determines the slope of the phase versus frequency curve of the device near resonance. It can also be seen as the ration between energy stored and energy lost per cycle of the resonator: Q ¼ EstoredElost :\nIn order to attain large quality factors, one needs to reduce the energy loss. This typically implies to work in vacuum [66]. However, when tackling real time biosensing applications, like protein or DNA detection, the immersion of the resonator into fluids is inevitable since most biological processes naturally occur in a fluidic environment. In this scenario, fluid viscous damping causes a drop of Q of several orders of magnitude.\nDetection in Liquids\nThe main strategies developed to exploit nanomechanical sensor performances for biological detection consist in (i) capture in fluidic phase and detection in vacuum, (ii) measurements in humid environment, and (iii) continuous operations in liquid focused on enhancing the quality factor [66, 67]. The first one will not be detailed here as the operation of the device is not performed in liquid.\nHumid environment\nCertain biological species like bacteria can grow and survive in humid environment. In this case, even though viscous damping is larger than in vacuum, it does not reach the levels offull immersion in liquid, thus the quality factor remains acceptable.Anexample of this biodetection is the growthmonitoringofEscherichia coli using cantilevers coated with nutritive layers (sugar) and operation in air with 100% humidity [77].\nReal-Time monitoring in liquid\nThere are many other cases, e.g. the detection of analytes, which require full fluidic immersion while the measurement is running. This, as announced before, poses a practical issue since viscous damping degrades Q. The solution for this has been, up to date, limited to a handful of experimental techniques. One example is the use of acoustic modes (QCM and SAW). Another option, considering flexural devices, is to use larger frequencies, higher vibrational modes [78], individual actuation and detection, vertical nanopillars [79–81] and suspended microchannels [82].\nQuartz Crystal Microbalance\nAn interesting device from the performance point of view is the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). It consists of a quartz disc with electrodes that allow for the excitation of a shear acoustic mode, which has an inherent low viscous interaction with the surrounding fluid (Fig. 4.12) [83]. QCMs are used now in a range of scientific disciplines, such as chemistry, biology, and material sciences, demonstrating also detection of biomolecules and bacteria [84]. The resonance frequencies of these devices are usually in the range of 10–50 MHz. The thickness of the crystal determines its resonant frequency, but at higher frequencies the devices become\n156 L. G. Villanueva et al.\nvery thin and too fragile. Because of the device thickness in the range of millimeters, the sensitivity of QCM is limited [84]. The lowest limit of detection of QCM in liquid has been achieved in the work by Cho et al. They demonstrated nanomolar sensitivity for continuous analyte monitoring of C-reactive protein, a biomarker for coronary heart disease, using an indirect-competitive assay [85].\nSurface Acoustic Wave Devices\nAnother example of acoustic sensors are SAW devices, which have been described in the previous paragraph for their capabilities in microfluidic actuation and micro-objects manipulation like mixing, pumping, merging and sorting among other applications [43]. SAW devices have also demonstrated to represent a cost-effective technology for label-free detection of biomolecular interactions, allowing highly sensitive real time detection of biomolecules such as DNA, protein and bacteria [86, 87]. Recently, Senvely and coworkers proposed a low cost innovative system capable of analyzing few picoliters of biological cell samples at high frequencies. Tumor cells are trapped inside microcavities along the SAW device surface. Through interaction with the samples, the resultant SAW reaching the output electrode exhibits a phase delay which is related to the cell mechanical stiffness [88].\nSAW devices generate and detect acoustic waves using interdigital transducers (IDT) on the surface of a piezoelectric crystal, typically lithium niobate (LiNbO3) or lithium tantalate (LiTaO3). As shown in Fig. 4.13, an input IDT converts an electrical signal into an acoustic wave through direct piezoelectric effect. On the opposite side, an output IDT converts the acoustic wave back into an electrical signal, through inverse piezoelectric effect. The surface acoustic wave travels along the space between the IDTs, known as the delay-line. The acoustic energy stays confined close to the surface of the PZE crystal in a depth range close to the acoustic wavelength, regardless of the thickness of the complete substrate. For this reason, the wave is potentially very sensitive towards any change on the surface, such as mass loading, viscosity and conductivity changes [86]. To permit the use of a SAW device as a biosensor, analyte-specific molecules are immobilized on the device surface to catch analyte molecules from the sample solution, as shown in Fig. 4.13. Analytes binding to the immobilized receptor molecules will influence the velocity of the SAW and hence the output signal measured by the system electronics [86].\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 157\nSAW devices can be found to be as thin as few hundreds of micrometers and their typical frequencies are much larger than those of QCMs. However, the acoustic waves are not purely shear, and thus radiate compression waves into the liquid, which induces larger damping than in the case of shear modes, but lower than in the case of flexural [87].\nSuspended Microchannel Resonators\nAs we have seen above, the minimum detectable mass is proportional to the mass of the device. In order to minimize said parameter, the optimum choice is to work with flexural devices, which can reach nanoscale dimensions and masses in the order of picograms, potentially allowing single molecule mass sensitivities. However, flexural devices exhibit out-of-plane vibrations, therefore their energy loss is much larger compared to acoustic resonators.\nAn important contribute to mechanical biosensing in liquids came from Manalis’ group in 2003, when they presented a device inspired to the millimeter scale densitometer developed by Stabinger and co-workers in 1967 [89]. Suspended microchannel resonators (SMRs) are resonant mass sensors for continuous biomolecular detection in a pico-liter fluid volume [82].\nSMRs consist of a hollow resonant structure containing embedded microfluidic channels. The fluid to be analyzed flows inside the resonator, thus viscous damping is almost completely suppressed, and mass loading is minimized. Real time analysis of fluidic samples is made possible while the whole device can be kept in dry environment or even in vacuum. SMRs have been successfully employed for several biosensing applications such as measuring single cell mass, density, volume, deformability, viscosity and monitoring cell growth. Quality factors up to 15,000 and very good mass sensitivities down to 1 ag in 1 kHz bandwidth have been demonstrated [90–95]. However, one of the major limitations of resonators with embedded fluidics (SMCs) is the costly and rather challenging fabrication process, with many steps, which include the use of aggressive chemicals.\nTwo modalities of operation are possible with SMRs devices: flow-through detection and affinity-based capture, shown in Fig. 4.14.\n158 L. G. Villanueva et al.\nIn the flow-through detection method a particle travelling inside the microfluidic channel induces a shift in the resonance frequency of the device, which is a function of the position of the particle along the resonating structure, and of the particle density, mass and volume. This approach has been mainly used to study the development of cells along time as a function of different conditions. In this case, the maximum flow rate is determined by the minimum particle residence time, which yields sufficient averaging to achieve a detectable signal above the noise floor.\nIn the affinity-based capture method target analytes are immobilized by molecular recognition on the bio-functionalized surface of the microfluidic channel. The functionalization can provide high specificity of capture, reducing false positives that can be caused by particles with similar mass. In this case, the added mass signal from immobilized target analytes can be averaged over a period of time longer than that for free-particle transit through the microchannel. Therefore, in contrast with the flow-through detection method, affinity-capture based SMRs devices are not limited by the analyte minimum residence time. Instead, the sensitivity is determined by the kinetics of diffusion and binding, which can be controlled through geometry and flow-rate.\nThe main limitation of this type of devices is the throughput, defined as the sample volume that can be analyzed per unit of time [96]. High throughputs can be obtained through pre-concentration of the analyte solution and device parallelization, as recently demonstrated by Cemark and co-workers [91].\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 159"

      "text" : "Microfluidic diagnostic tools provide numerous advantages over conventional macroscale methods in terms of sample volume, low cost, portability and integration in a complete chain of analysis in Lab-On-a-Chip devices. Among the key features of fluidic microsystems is the possibility to structure the geometry at a scale comparable to that of cells, the ability to control precisely the cellular environment and to perform analysis at the single-cell level while dealing with large populations. The high heterogeneity of cell samples, containing many different species at very different abundance levels, is one of the great challenges in clinical research and biomedical engineering. Concentrating, focusing, trapping and sorting these cells are thus critical steps in various biomedical applications including (i) diagnostics, (ii) therapeutics and (iii) cell biology, where the least abundant cells can be the most important. Indeed, some domains such as oncology, stem cells research or infectious disease, have raised great interest in identifying, accumulating and counting various types of “rare cells”—cells present as a very small subpopulation in a large amount of surrounding cells—or bacteria in blood [97]. Rare cells such as Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) may be difficult to isolate as large volumes of blood are required to be relevant [98], imposing a very high throughput of the separation technique. For example, HIV diagnostic and theranostic rely on the separation and count of human T-lymphocytes (CD4+) from whole blood [99, 100]. Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis can also be performed by separating rare fetal cells such as Nucleated Red Blood Cells (NRBCs) from peripheral maternal blood [101]. For example, CTCs [102], stem cells [103] and malaria-infected Red Blood Cells (RBCs) [104] would highly benefit from rapid, efficient and low-cost separation microdevices.\nMicrofluidic cell manipulation and sorting methods can be divided in two: active and passive approaches. Active methods are based on the application of an external field to achieve particle manipulation, (dielectrophoresis, acoustophoresis, magnetophoresis, etc.…) whereas passive techniques rely on the channel geometry and associated hydrodynamic forces to operate on cells. Although it may be considered as a passive sorting approach, the immunological-based separation, which exploits the presence of antibodies at the surface of the cells of interest, will not be discussed here. The different label-free passive techniques rely on several cells intrinsic physical properties such as size, shape, deformability or density to manipulate and sort them. Passive label-free techniques generally require fewest preparation steps than active ones, making it a highly attractive approach for cell manipulation. For detailed information on active techniques, affinity-based methods and their comparison with passive ones, the readers are suggested to refer to specific chapters of the present book or the following review papers from Xuan et al. [105], Bhagat et al. [106], Shields IV et al. [107], Autebert et al. [108] and Gosset et al. [109].\n160 L. G. Villanueva et al.\nIn this section, we aim at introducing and discussing the different approaches available to perform concentration, trapping, manipulation and sorting of cells and their applications. We propose to analyze many passive techniques for cell manipulation, concentration and isolation in microsystems, detailing their mode of action and trying to evaluate their performances to allow comparison. We document potential applications, discuss the main advantages and limitations of the different approaches, and attempt to outline the main remaining challenges in this fast evolving field.\n4.3.2 Microfiltration\nA commonly employed technique to isolate cells is microfiltration. Most of cell sorting devices using microfiltration rely on both size and deformability to define the pore size and the type of filtration. In the following, we will detail various approaches with one common feature: the use of micropatterns to induce specific behavior of particles flowing in a microfluidic device."

      "text" : "The use of micropatterns (pillars, weirs, wells, etc.…) is very attractive for size and deformability-based cell sorting or capture. This approach is especially well adapted to the microsystem format where characteristic dimensions are comparable to the typical size of cells. Size-based microfiltration faces many challenges including the heterogeneity of size within a population of cell and membrane clogging. Four types of microfilters have been implemented for whole blood filtration [110]: membrane, weir, pillar and cross-flow (Fig. 4.15a).\nMembrane microfilters are composed of well-defined pores, designed to prevent the passage of cells below a critical size. More than 90% recovery of lung cancer cells from spiked blood samples, with a relatively high processing throughput of 10 mL/h, was recently demonstrated using a highly porous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane filter-based microdevice [114].\nWeir-type microfiltration has been used to produce cell-free blood plasma [115, 116] for diagnostics. The microdevice has been designed such as the sample would flow through a planar groove, small enough to retain all blood cells (Fig. 4.15a). However, very small amount of plasma—typically several tens of nanoliters—was produced due to the use of capillary-driven flow [116]. The obtained filtrate was tested negative for significant levels of hemoglobin and cellular debris.\nPillar-type microfiltration implements micro-obstacles which spacing is chosen adequately to retain cells above a given critical size (Fig. 4.15a). Such design has been successfully applied to the isolation of fetal nucleated RBCs from cord blood using rows of pillars with decreasing spacing [117]. However, it is unsuitable for\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 161\nprenatal diagnosis due to the relatively low throughput achieved (0.35 mL/h) and the high probability of clogging, the cells being trapped in the direction of the flow.\nCross-flow microfiltration was developed to reduce clogging and filter saturation. The working principle is similar, except that the flow is perpendicular to the array of obstacles or weir filter (see Fig. 4.15a). Cross-flow filtration has been used by Sethu et al. to achieve separation of 97% of White Blood Cells (WBCs) from whole blood [118] at a flow rate of 5 µL/min. A similar approach has been implemented by Han et al. [111] to isolate mechanically impaired malaria-infected RBCs, rigidified by the presence of the parasite, from healthy ones. The cells are flown in a channel with several parallel trenches which walls have been dimensioned such as deformable cells can squeeze from one trench to another but stiffer ones cannot. A flow is applied at an angle with respect to the trenches (Fig. 4.15b), allowing deformable healthy RBCs to follow the flow and be collected on one side of the outlet whereas the parasited RBCs keep linear trajectories and are collected on the other side of the\n162 L. G. Villanueva et al.\noutlet [111]. Reported studies on mechanical filtration microsystems [119] show limited efficiency in the target cell isolation at high throughput. Recent published work reports another approach to overcome clogging: the use of low frequency oscillating flow [120]. They achieve collection of target polystyrene particles with 100% efficiency and demonstrate the separation of CTCs from whole blood (50 fixed MDA-MB-231 cells in 200 µL of blood processed at 200 µL/h)."

      "text" : "Microsytems implementing micropatterns can also be employed to perform cell trapping. Located in the path of the flow, those micropatterns forming cavities are designed such as only one cell gets trapped in it. Such platforms offer the possibility to perfuse different reagents to the individually captured cells and to study their response, which can be highly attractive for drug screening assays in the framework of personalized medicine applications. Di Carlo et al. [121] demonstrate the capture of single HeLa cells using arrays of physical U-shaped hydrodynamic trapping structures. Their microsystem allows both the culture of individual adherent cells and the dynamic control of fluid perfusion with uniform environments. With a similar approach, Tan et al. [112] have demonstrated the capture of CTCs (issued from 8 different types of cancer: breast and gastric carcinomas, tongue and pharynx squamous carcinomas, etc…) in blood using arrays of crescent-shaped isolation wells and their subsequent release for further analysis (Fig. 4.15c). Typically, 100 cells suspended in 1 mL of blood were successfully flown at a pressure of 5 kPa in the device and performances with very low count of cancer cells (typically 1–3 cancer cells in 1 mL of buffer) were evaluated at 81%. Recently, Yamada et al. [113] have reported a clever approach to trap and release giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) in a thin and wide microfluidic channel, as they cross indentations etched in the channel ceiling (Fig. 4.15d). The particles being squeezed to flow into the shallow channel, partially relax when entering a well with a larger height, leading to their capture. They demonstrate that GUVs, whose diameter is slightly larger than the channel height, can be trapped and subsequently released by flowing the outer fluid beyond a critical velocity [113]. They report a size-dependency of the critical flow velocity necessary to untrap the GUVs.\nIn this review we introduced different label-free passive manipulation techniques, which characteristics are gathered for comparison in Table 4.1."

G. Villanueva et al.\nout of the system. At low Reynolds number, an object entering a streamline will tend to follow it, thus having a deterministic behavior. When encountering an obstacle, the behavior will change according to the particle size. Indeed, if the particle has a typical size smaller than a critical hydrodynamic diameter Dc, it will follow the main stream line, circumventing the obstacle. In the contrary, if the object size is larger than Dc, the object will bump into the obstacle which will lead to a shift in stream line (Fig. 4.16a). The critical hydrodynamic diameter Dc is related to the inter-posts distance d and the period of the array N according to the following equation [132]:\nDc ¼ ffiffiffiffi N 3 r : d N ; ð4:1Þ\nThe influence of the geometrical parameters on Dc was carefully evaluated by Inglis et al. [135] and have been used to fractionate undiluted whole blood samples [122], separate parasites from human blood [136] and isolate cancer cells [137]. By tuning the posts size, their spacing, as well as the shift between adjacent post rows, Huang et al. [138] demonstrated that Dc could be tuned precisely enough to sort 0.8, 0.9 and 1.03 µm in diameter particles upon their size. Obstacles can be any shape: cylindrical, rectangular or triangular [127]. Tottori et al. [139] used a DLD microfluidic device to sort viable Jurkat cells from nonviable apoptotic ones, the latter being smaller due to shrinkage and fragmentation. However, such microsystem is much more complicated than it seems as one need to take into account the deformability of the cells. Actually, DLD is a size-based separation technique but it is also sensitive to shape (Fig. 4.16b) and rigidity (Fig. 4.16c) of the target cell as shown by Beech et al. [133] on RBCs. Finally, thermally tunable DLD has been demonstrated [134] recently. Indeed, by implementing poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (poly-NIPAM)—a thermo-sensitive hydrogel known to be swollen or shrinked, respectively below and above a critical temperature—pillar arrays, it is possible to tune at will the size and spacing of the posts, by adapting the temperature as illustrated Fig. 4.16d."

In this technique the sample is injected in a main channel having multiple side branches. Small amount of liquid is repeatedly drained through the side branches, hence concentrating and aligning all the cells along the sidewalls of the main microchannel (Fig. 4.18a). The size difference positions small particles closer to the sidewall than larger ones, allowing the former to be filtered out earlier. The size threshold is determined by the relative flow rate in the main and side channels, which depend on the flow resistance of each branch and may be adjusted by changing the pressure drop applied to each channel. Yamada et al. applied this technique to the selective enrichment of leukocytes from 10-folds diluted blood at 20 µL/min [146] and liver cells in culture medium at *2 − 3 106 cells/mL at 50 µL/min with a throughput higher than 2 105 cells/min [125]. Recently Aoki et al. [147] applied the principle of hydrodynamic filtration to the focusing of 5 µm particles along the centerline of a main microchannel. They used multiple loop side channels to drain the liquid out upstream, before re-injecting it into the main channel from both sides simultaneously, serving as sheath flow to focus the particles."

This method relies on the use of a sheath buffer injected such that the particulate content of the sample is pushed against one wall in a pinched segment of the channel. Due to the difference in size, the center of mass of small cells are located on streamlines closer to the wall than that of bigger ones. This difference in lateral position is significantly amplified by the parabolic velocity profile in Poiseuille flow. As the channel widens after the pinched segment, the particles of different size are rapidly dispersed perpendicular to the main flow, allowing them to be collected into distinct outlets (Fig. 4.18b). Unless\n168 L. G. Villanueva et al.\nother separation techniques relying on the device geometry (size and spacing of microstructures, radius of curvature of the channel, shape of micropatterns…), cells of varying sizes can be separated effectively in the same device by adjusting the flow rates of the sample and sheath buffer. Takagi et al. [126] have improved the separation efficiency by playing with the hydrodynamic resistance of the different outlets. They have shown enrichment of RBCs from a 0.3% diluted blood suspension, at a flow rate of 20 µL/h, with a separation efficiency above 90% [126]. Higher flow rates are usually avoided as inertial forces acting on the particles tend to affect their motion, and thus the sorting efficiency. Recently Lu et al. [149, 150] have demonstrated a continuous shape-based separation of spherical and peanut-shaped rigid particles of equivalent spherical diameters. This technique, referred to as elasto-inertial pinched flow fractionation, exploits the dependence of the lift on the shape of a particle suspended in viscoelastic fluids, to amplify the separation induced by the pinched flow fractionation microdevice [149]."

These inertial forces can therefore be exploited to precisely manipulate the cell position within these\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 169\nsystems.

As a result, particles will move to specific equilibrium positions within the channel cross-section, according to their size (Fig. 4.19a). Di Carlo et al. were among the first to investigate the inertial focusing of objects in straight microchannels [128]. They observed that initially uniformly distributed microbeads of 9 µm in diameter were focused along the centers of each of the four walls (see Fig. 4.19b) as the Reynolds number was increased (Re = 90), leading to local particle concentration. Using this principle, Bhagat et al. have demonstrated continuous filtration of particles from a suspension [155]. The same phenomenon has been implemented in microsystem in order to achieve controlled encapsulation of single cells into microdroplets [156] and sheathless focusing of cells for high throughput flow cytometry [157].\nRecently, Di Carlo’s group [158] studied inertial focusing of particles in non-rectangular cross-section channels, such as semi-circular or triangular shapes. They demonstrated that they can modulate the location and number of focusing positions depending on the cross-section shapes and Reynolds number. By connecting channels with different cross-sectional shapes, they reported the focusing of microparticles to a single stream with 99% purity [158]."

The Dean drag force will concentrate particles on specific flow lines at the expense of others. Di Carlo et al. [128] observed that the four equilibrium positions observed in straight channels, were reduced to two in a symmetric sinusoidal channel and to a single equilibrium position in an asymmetric channel (Fig. 4.19b). They demonstrated that cells could be differentially focused and sorted based on size under laminar flow, with a high throughput (1.5 mL/min), using a serpentine pattern (Fig. 4.19c).

Thus leaving a “cell-free” plasma layer adjacent to the vessel wall [167]. Faivre et al. [129] used a geometric constriction to enhance the size of the “cell-free” layer (Fig. 4.20a). They report the recovery of 24% of the initial blood plasma from a 16% hematocrit blood suspension (dilution 1:3), at a working flow rate of 200 µL/h [129]. Key parameters of this approach include the sample viscosity—which can be tuned by dilution—the flow rate, the cells volume and deformability, as well as the shape and size of the geometric constriction. Later, Sollier et al. [168] has improved the performances of such devices by adding geometrical singularities such as ear-cavities or corner-edges. They reached a recovery of 10.7% of the plasma, at a flow rate of 100 µL/min, from a blood sample diluted at 1:20.

Briefly, whole blood is flown through multiple symmetric and asymmetric bifurcations (Fig. 4.20b). Most of the RBCs flown in the wider outlet, while marginalized leukocytes entered the narrower outlet, leading to nearly 10-fold enrichment of WBCs. Jaggi et al.

Indeed, in such conditions, they observed that RBCs flow preferentially in the daughter channel with the lower flow rate (Fig. 4.20e), leading to hematocrit in that branch even greater than in the parent vessel [171].

We chose not to discuss here immunological techniques, where antibody-antigen associations are exploited to achieve cell capture, separation or labelling. The extensive literature in the field underlines the strong interest drawn by label-free passive techniques to manipulate, concentrate, trap, isolate or sort cells using these approaches. Many of the methods presented are at the proof-of-concept stage and few have demonstrated their performances on actual clinical samples. Although they present the advantage on active techniques to be easily manufacturable and to provide cells with minimum residence time under harmful conditions, they still need to overcome some limitations such as low selectivity and low throughput. Advances on parallelization and other scale-up approaches are required especially when rare cells (e.g. CTCs in blood) are involved, as CTCs levels can be as low as 1 cell/mL in early stages. Another drawback of these techniques relying on microscale fluid dynamics, is the need to integrate precise and autonomous flow handling solutions. Finally, the sample preparation procedure often associated may impact the performances of the manipulation due to user variations. Therefore building a microfluidic device that require minimal sample preparation and reducing the dimensions of the apparatus associated with the chip remains a major challenge to be commercially viable.\nThe selection of the adapted method will depend on the properties of the target cells regarding those of the rest of the sample, and on the needs of the application (efficiency, reliability, simplicity, throughput…). Current microfluidics technology has already demonstrated that it can be used to separate and analyze diseased or rare cells from a sample, more rapidly, with more sensitivity and in a more controlled way. Ultimately, the goal is to develop a portable diagnostic tool—the so-called Lab-On-a-Chip—integrating a whole chain of complex processes needed to perform the desired analysis. Such devices will have tremendous applications in cell biology research, diagnosis, drug screening and personalized medicine.\n174 L. G. Villanueva et al."

For example, variation of Red Blood Cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) deformability is associated with malaria [174] and sickle cell anemia [175], White Blood Cells (WBCs) deformability varies in sepsis [176] and acute respiratory distress syndrome [177], and increase deformability of metastatic cancer cells [178] and drop of stiffness during stem cell differentiation [179] have been observed.

      "text" : "Cell mechanical behavior is inextricably related to their intra-cellular composition and architecture, particularly the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is a complex 3D network of biopolymers which primarily defines cell shape and mechanical response to physical stresses and plays a central role in mechanotransduction, mitosis and migration [173]. It is mainly composed of actin microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules. Actin microfilaments are linear polymers that prevent overall cell deformation in response to external stimuli and can polymerize into helicoidal filaments and depolimerize within minutes to facilitate cell motion. Intermediate filaments form an intracellular intricated network connecting the nucleus to the plasma membrane and other organelles. They provide cell structural integrity and resist tension at strain levels where actin networks do not\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 175\nretain their structural integrity [180]. Microtubules consist in tubulin polymers that contribute to the transport of intra-cellular components within the cell and resist compression. Both the composition and the organization of these combined elements contribute to the cell mechanical phenotype [173]. The interaction of a cell with its environment can also dramatically influence its mechanical properties. Indeed when spread on a surface, adherent cells exhibit a different cytoskeleton conformation than when in suspension, leading to differences in mechanical response to solicitations [181]. In the case of adherent cells, the polymerization/ depolymerization of cytoskeleton components in response to both intracellular and extracellular stimuli may significantly alter the global cell mechanical signature. This is especially noticeable during biological processes such as cell division, or cell-cell contacts where extensive cytoskeletal remodeling occurs.\nThe cell membrane contributes also to the cell mechanical properties due to its connections to the cytoskeleton. It passes strains and stresses on the intracellular tensile and compressive components. For small deformations, membrane viscoelasticity can contribute to overall cell mechanical behavior. It is especially relevant when cells are in suspension, which is the case in flow-based approaches, where viscoelastic characteristics of the membrane plays a role in the cell distribution within the channel [182] (see Sect. 4.3). The presence of the nucleus and other organelles can contribute locally to the mechanical properties of the cell according to their physical size. High-resolution mechanical mapping of flattened cells using AFM presents different rigidity, depending if the measurement has been performed over the nucleus or over cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal areas [183].\nThe RBC membrane possesses a unique structure responsible of their remarkable mechanical properties (deformability, elasticity, shear resistance, etc.…) allowing them to go through the small capillaries of the microcirculation. RBCs have an elastic 2D mesh-like spectrin cytoskeleton anchored to the internal side of a lipid bilayer [184]. The membrane of the erythrocyte encloses a cytoplasm made of hemoglobin—allowing the transportation of oxygen through the organism—which viscosity at 25 °C is 10 mPa.s. Together with the cytoplasmic fluid and the absence of nucleus and other organelles, the membrane controls the overall deformability of the cell. Under normal conditions, the membrane deforms at constant area and exhibits both elastic and viscous behaviors. The extension of the membrane is governed by the lipid bilayer, which tends to resist area expansion. The shear resistance of the membrane is directly linked to the density of spectrin and thus, to the cytoskeleton [185]. RBCs have been extensively studied in the past fifty years in order to characterize mechanical phenotypes associated with both healthy and pathological states."

In micropipette aspiration, either a portion or a whole cell is aspired into the opening of a micropipette while monitoring the extension of the membrane, leading to the evaluation of the viscoelastic properties locally or at the whole-cell level, respectively. Unlike AFM and micropipette aspiration, optical tweezers are attractive mechanical assays because they do not necessarily require mechanical contact with the target cells. Optical tweezers uses a highly focused laser beam to create a 3D light gradient exerting a force on the cell, relying on the dielectric contrast with the surrounding media.

The cells are being individually stretched at forces on the order of 200–500 pN, which is still not sufficient to induce large deformation.

The method relies on the observation of the deformation resultant of the cell compression by an actuated flexible membrane (Fig. 4.22a). The relaxation time—the characteristic time necessary for the cells to recover their equilibrium shape as compression is stopped—is used to discriminate two cell lines. Changes in the mechanical response due to disruption of the cellular actin network using Cytochalasin D—an inhibitor of actin polymerization—is also highlighted [193]. With a similar approach, Kim et al. [194] used difference in the bulge generation associated with cell compression, to identify cancerous (MCF-7) from non-malignant breast cells (MCF-10A). Indeed upon cell compression by a flexible membrane and beyond a given strain, cellular membrane expands and small bulges form on the peripheral cell membrane. They explain these bulge formations where cytoskeleton detaches from the membrane bilayer, by a lower amount of actin present in cancerous cells than in normal ones [194].\nCompression experiments with micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), to probe living cells stiffness, have also been reported in the literature [196, 197]. They usually rely on the controlled displacement of a moving actuator compressing the cell against a fixed part. For example, Barazani et al. [197] developed a MEMS relying on an AC driven electrothermal micro-actuator to compress single yeast cells against a reference back spring. The motion of the reference spring divided by the cell deformation provides the cell stiffness relative to the reference spring constant. They report an average stiffness of the yeast cells of 9.3 ± 3.1 Nm−1 and an average force necessary to rupture their membrane of 0.47 ± 0.1 µN. Gnerlich et al. [196] have worked on a similar MEMS and they have reported the compression of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts by moving the actuator by 4 µm for 90 s using a calibrated piezo-driver. They have measured the associated forces decreased during the compression from 38 to 5 nN, which is well described by a viscoelastic cell model. Finally, we can cite the work from Lafitte et al. [198] presenting the utilization of silicon nano-tweezers (SNT) to probe the mechanical properties of biological samples (DNA and cells). Typically, one tip of the tweezer can be alternatively open and closed to compress the cell and the other one is fixed and senses the absolute force applied. The mechanical response of the cells can be deduced in real-time from the changes of the resonance frequency of the SNT, knowing that the resonance response changes according to the added rigidity and\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 179\nviscosity of the cell.

Cellular deformability can be challenged either by the walls of the device or by the associated shear stress without any contact, thus limiting the impact of cell membrane adhesion with channel boundaries. Microfluidic deformability-based passive separation techniques can also be used to characterize mechanical phenotype of cells. Such techniques have been detailed in Sect. 4.3 and therefore will not be addressed again here.\nFluid stretching. RBCs are highly deformable and their deformability can therefore be challenged using shear stress generated by microfluidic channels wider than the typical size of the cell. Forsyth et al. [199] reported three different dynamic behaviors of RBCs in a pressure-driven flow, according to the shear rate: stretching, tumbling and recoiling. Upon chemical treatment with glutaraldehyde, which is known to rigidify both cell membrane and cytoplasm, RBCs presented lower deformation and increased occurrence of tumbling, which is a motion typical of rigid bodies. Lee et al. [200] reported the monitoring of RBC deformation in a\n180 L. G. Villanueva et al.\nhyperbolic converging microchannel. They showed that the extensional flow is more efficient to induce cell deformation than a shear flow, as RBCs presented deformation index of 0.51 and 0.29 at 3 Pa respectively. Such approach was used to detect the decrease in deformability of RBCs following heat treatment.\nGosset et al. [195] proposed an automated microfluidic tool using inertial focusing to uniformly deliver cells to a stretching extensional flow where cells are deformed at high strain rates (Fig. 4.22b). They characterized the deformability of populations of leukocytes andmalignant cells in pleural fluid samples. They predicted disease state in patients with cancer and immune activation with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 86% at high throughput (2000 cells/s). Both lymphocyte activation and stem cell pluripotency were found to be associated with increased deformability [195].\nConstriction channels. Constriction channels with dimensions smaller than the typical size of a single cell provide a simple and powerful tool to probe cell deformability. Several types of geometric restrictions have been reported in the literature to quantify cell mechanical phenotype, using however the same type of readout (transit time, deformation index and relaxation time). For example Selby et al. [201] reported the use of a well-defined geometrical constriction ranging from 8 to 2 µm in width and controlled pressure gradients in order to discriminate healthy and malaria-iRBCs. They report that as parasites develop within the host cell, the increase of RBCs rigidity prevent their passage through smaller constrictions. Indeed Fig. 4.23a illustrates the blockage of a 6 µm wide channel by schizontes-iRBCs, whereas a hRBC (in red) manages to deform past the barricade. Using the same approach, Suresh [180] probed the mechanical properties of human pancreatic cells flowing in a microfluidic channel at 0.5 µL/min (Fig. 4.23b). By studying transit velocity measurements, shape change and relaxation at the exit of the narrowing, they connected changes in cell deformability and motility [180]. The distinction between non-malignant and cancerous cells flowing in similar geometries was demonstrated using entry time [202, 203]—defined as the time necessary for the cell to deform and enter completely into the microchannel—and deformation index measurements [203].\nFlow of cells in 16 parallel channels implementing multiple constrictions has also been reported (Fig. 4.23c) [204]. The study revealed that transit time scales indeed with cell size and that simultaneous transit events occurring across neighboring constrictions can influence transit time [204]. A comparable geometry was used to quantify the effect of taxol—an anti-cancer drug—on the transit time of tumor cells [207] through the serial constrictions. The results show that when travelling through the first constriction, cells treated with taxol undergo longer transit times than untreated cells, however for subsequent transits the difference was smaller between the two groups [207]. Rosenbluth et al. [208] measured single-cell transit times of white blood cell populations passing through in vitro capillary networks, allowing to observe several channels in parallel. They demonstrate clinical relevance of their geometry in sepsis and leukostasis, showing increased transit time with patient samples relative to control ones. Their results also revealed that chemotherapy reduce leukemia cell deformability [209]. Herricks et al. [210] reported that\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 181\nring-iRBCs get blocked upstream whereas hRBCs reached positions further downstream in converging channels. The dynamic behavior of RBCs flowing through arrays of 15 µm pillars, either slowly through 5–2 µm wide gaps or rapidly along 10 µm wide channels has been studied [211]. They observed that mechanically impaired RBCs—either due to heat treatment or issued from malaria-iRBCs or from patients with hereditary spherocytosis—tend to accumulate in narrow slits more frequently than normal RBCs, hence demonstrating their increased rigidity. The same approach was used by Preira et al. [205] to explore the effect of actin organization and miosin II on the deformability of leukocytes using pore-based deformability measurement (Fig. 4.23d). They highlighted that cell stiffness\n182 L. G. Villanueva et al.\ndepends mainly on actin organization, whereas shape is related to miosin II. Similarily, Bow et al. [206] have monitored dynamic mechanical responses of 103– 104 individual RBCs using converging or diverging obstacles (Fig. 4.23e). They have experimentally demonstrated that differences in RBC deformability, demonstrated by differences in transit velocity, are enhanced in geometries with sharper corners, for a given pressure difference. The influence of an anti-malaria drug (Artesunate) on the dynamic deformability of ring-infected iRBCs was also evaluated [212]. After Artesunate treatment, they observed a 50% decrease in the transit velocity of iRBCs whereas only 10% in speed reduction is observed for hRBCs.\nA limitation to constriction channels however is the influence of size and adhesiveness on cells behavior, which makes it difficult to emphasize the role of deformability alone. Indeed, recent studies trying to take the cell size into account have been reported in the literature [213]. They showed that cell size significantly influences travel times and that for a given volume, stiffer cells have longer transit times than compliant ones. However, efforts still need to be made to characterize adhesion and/or friction between channel walls and cell membrane, for example by varying the walls coating. Nyberg et al. [204] have reported variability in transit time measurements as the PDMS device age after plasma treatment; they attribute such discrepancies to modifications in channel surface properties. Another drawback of this approach is the need to adapt precisely the size of the constriction to dimensions of cells of interest to avoid clogging or deform significantly the cells.\nPressure drop measurements. Abkarian et al. [214, 215] proposed a high-speed microfluidic approach to measure dynamical pressure-drop variations associated with the flow of individual cells in confined geometries. The chip is composed of two identical channels (picture in Fig. 4.24a); the cells suspension is injected in the upper channel whereas a solution of contrast agent is injected in the lower one. The two channels merge on the right side of the chip and the contrast agent allow the visualization of the co-flow virtual interface. In absence of cells flowing in the upper channel, the virtual interface is centered, hence traducing the equilibrium between the pressures in the two channels. When a deformable cell enters the upper channel, an additional hydrodynamic resistance is added to the channel resistance, leading to changes in the local pressure profile, thus inducing a displacement of the virtual interface. Thanks to an appropriate calibration, the deflation of the interface can be converted into a pressure drop measurement. The authors have shown that the amplitude of pressure drop depends on both the volume and the deformability (graph in Fig. 4.24a) of the cells under study. Indeed, pressure-drop measurements are able to discriminate WBCs and RBCS, as well as healthy and chemically rigidified RBCs [214]. Khan et al. [203] applied this approach to the mechanical characterization of healthy and cancerous brain cells. The two cell lines were differentiated using entry time and to a little extend pressure drops, rather than on speeds and elongations. They observed that brain tumor cells have a longer entry time, thus suggesting that the well-spread idea that cancer cells are more deformable than benign cells may not apply to brain cancer cells [203].\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 183\nMicrofluidic micropipette aspiration. Guo et al. [216] proposed an adaptation of the conventional micropipette aspiration technique into microfluidic format. Figure 4.24b presents the geometry of the microfluidic micropipette aspiration device implementing multiple funnel-shaped constrictions with openings ranging from 5 down to 1 µm. As a cell is flowing in the device, it gets trapped at the nozzle of a funnel, the pressure difference is manually increased until the RBC is allowed to squeeze past the restriction. The threshold pressure is used to determine the intrinsic stiffness of each cell. Using the same mathematical model as in conventional pipette aspiration technique, i.e. considering the RBC as a liquid-drop with constant volume, they managed to extract the cell cortical tension. Malaria-iRBCs by early (ring) through late (schizont) developmental stages of the parasite were shown to be 1.5 to 200-fold stiffer than uninfected cells (graph in Fig. 4.24b) as already reported in the literature [217]. However, the rectangular cross-section of\n184 L. G. Villanueva et al.\nthe geometry can rise concerns about the validity of applying conventional micropipette models to retrieve cellular mechanical properties."

      "text" : "Although they present many advantages such as possible automation, absence of labeling and compatibility with high throughput, each microfluidic mechanical characterization technique has some drawbacks. In optical stretching, cells are exposed to the power of the laser which may damage them and electro-deformation require a change in suspending media; such low conductivity buffer may accelerate aging of the cells. Multi-steps soft lithography processes are needed to implement the flexible membrane in compression experiments. A disadvantage of constriction channels is the persistent possibility of device clogging. Indeed, as the section of the constriction is smaller than the typical size of the cells, one need to adapt carefully the width of the constriction. A group proposed recently an improvement with the development of a constriction channel with tunable section [218, 219]. One of the walls of the constriction was replaced by a thin membrane, which deflection is controlled via external pressure. In case of channel obstruction by larger particles or cellular aggregates, the increase of the applied pressure causes the augmentation of the constriction cross-section through deflection of the membrane, thus removing the obstruction.\nUp to recently, the various techniques presented above presented the same limitation in terms of throughput because of the use of high-speed video-microscopy for monitoring cellular mechanical responses such as the deformation index. Indeed, even when using automated post-processing routines, the huge amount of image data to analyze imposes computational power and remains time consuming. In replacement of high-speed camera, electrical impedance measurements has been reported in the literature to detect RBCs [220] and cancer cells [213] deformation in constriction channels, with a throughput of 100 cells/s. In 2015, Jochen Guck’s group has proposed an automated real-time deformability cytometer (RTDT) able to perform continuous cell mechanical characterization of large populations (above 100 000 cells) with throughput greater than 100 cells/s [221, 222]. Their system consists in the real-time measurement of the deformation associated with the passage of cells into a constriction channel. They report that RT-DC is sensitive to cytoskeletal alterations and can distinguish cell-cycle phases, track stem cell differentiation into distinct lineages and identify cell populations in whole blood by their mechanical fingerprints. More recently, Deng and Chung [223] proposed a similar device allowing nearly real-time analysis of transient deformation of cells hitting a wall at a T-junction. Their automated process allow the mechanical characterization of cells at a throughput of 2000 cells/s. Finally, the last challenge that still need to be addressed is the translation of raw parameters such as entry time or deformation index into cellular intrinsic mechanical characteristics such as Young’s modulus or cortical tension. Indeed, intrinsic deformability parameters are independent of the setup\n4 Mechanics for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 185\n(viscosity, flow speed, etc.…) and allow the comparison of data obtained with various techniques and by various research groups. Therefore there is a strong need for theoretical framework and mechanical modeling of the cellular response in order to extract intrinsic mechanical properties."

      "text" : "The integration of optics and microfluidics has brought significant advances in micro/nano-systems, broadly ranging from biosensors to particle manipulation techniques [1–5]. In this section of this book, we categorized cutting-edge technologies that utilize optofluidics in three: synthesis, manipulation, and detection. Synthesis part of this chapter will introduce photopolymerization and its uses in microfluidic environments. The manipulation part will mostly be consisted of optomechanics in microfluidic environments, suggesting the bridge between the microfluidic systems to generic bioassays. The detection part of this chapter will address the detection methods that were enabled by optics in micro and nano-systems. This chapter was written to address current technologies as well as fundamental knowledge of the basics of optics in micro/nano-systems.\nSince matter can also modulate or change light, which in turn gives us useful information about that matter, we can apply this phenomenon for high resolution and sensitive signal detection. A direct example is the object that we see. We can see this object since it absorbs and reflects light. In this section, we will study the detection methods in optofluidics.\nLight is useful in observing materials in two aspects. First, light is one of the most abundant sources that can generate energy. Second, we can easily manipulate light with lens, filter, and many other optical devices. Therefore, we can easily configure the observing condition by modifying light. Third, in visible light wavelength, the light carries relatively low energy and barely modifies the target material. In other words, light can preserve the integrity of biomaterial we want to observe.\nOptical microscopy is widely used as a device in order to observe small biomaterials in biology. We can simply observe biomaterials by illuminating the bright field and observing the transmitted light (bright-field microscopy). The absorption of light by the sample causes the contrast in the image, which we can observe and recognize this sample. Although the bright-field image suffers from low contrast in biomaterial, we even can clearly observe the boundary of bacterial cells and their shape. Jungil Choi et al. (2013) have used this simple bright field image to observe\n198 A. C. Lee et al.\nbacterial cell division and ultimately reduce the antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) time [6]. They used Agarose gel to immobilize bacteria and diffused antibiotics using microfluidic channel (Fig. 5.1a). After time-lapse observation of bacteria cell division, they could accurately obtain MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) and reduced the time of AST about 6 folds.\nThe image of an object is very complicated and shows specific characteristics of this object. This leads to a new concept of using shape as unique identifying character of an object. If we manage to make such shape physically unclonnable, we can fundamentally block counterfeiting. Bae et al. (2015) used photopolymerization discussed in Fig. 5.1 to generate particle followed by silica coating and dry to induce a wrinkle [7, 8]. The biomimetic wrinkle pattern was similar to human fingerprints so that the random generated pattern contained unique codes. This means that the wrinkled microparticle can be generated with low-cost and scalable manner to be used as unique ID of an object. Furthermore, after developing algorithms to decode wrinkles from image obtained with a portable microscope attached to a smartphone, they expect to utilize this particle in real world.\nThere are many other interesting techniques and types of microscopes, which will not be covered here. However, all the optical microscopies have fundamental drawback. Since light has wave property, all the optical microscopies have a resolution limit called Abbe diffraction limit.\nd ¼ k 2nsinh\nð5:1Þ\nIn green light wavelength (500 nm), diffraction limit is about 0.25 um, which is smaller than the size of biological cells (1–100 um) but is bigger than that of proteins (1–100 nm). In other words, we cannot see protein and many other objects smaller than 500 nm. Let’s now explore some useful techniques to overcome these limits.\n5 Optics and Fluidics 199"

      "heading" : "5.2.2 Fluorescence",
      "text" : "Fluorescence is one of the most widely tools to detect biological material below diffraction limit of light observation system. It is emission of light from a matter, which has absorbed light. When light passes through the matter, light is absorbed by this matter. In Quantum mechanical sense, quantum energy of the photon is transferred to the molecule and electron of the atom is excited. After electron undergoes non-radiative relaxation where small energy of excited electron is dissipated in the form of vibration, molecule then emits remaining energy in the form of photon (Fig. 5.2). This is the principle of fluorescence and therefore has longer wavelength than absorbed light.\nSince wavelength of emitted fluorescence is longer that excitation light, excitation light can now be filtered out by short pass-filter, which in turn enables observation of signal (fluorescence) without background. With fluorescence molecules bound to a detection analyte, since it can bind to the analyte in molecular scale, the theoretical observation limit is below single molecule [9]. Even though diffraction of emitted fluorescent light remains same, fluorophore (fluorescent chemical compound) can label (or attached to) the target molecule, so we can now observe and quantify the analyte as well as image how this analyte is spatially distributed. Furthermore, efforts to obtain various color fluorophores leads to a development of a variety of fluorescent protein like Fig. 5.3a. We can now detect and observe small biological materials such as protein in relatively non-destructive, full color way.\nFluorescence signal detection technology can also take advantage of fluidic system. Since most biological materials are dissolved in liquid (even cells are filled with cytoplasm), a direct application would be multiplexed quantification of target molecules. An example is DNA microarray [10]. A DNA microarray is an array of DNA probe spots bound to a solid surface. Each probe has DNA sequence\n200 A. C. Lee et al.\ncomplementary to target cDNA, and samples are prepared by reverse transcription of sample mRNA followed by labeling with fluorescence. The brighter spot on DNA microarray is, the more abundant target mRNA is, and we can quantify a variety of mRNA expressions in parallel. Even more, if we make DNA microarray chip to target cancer related gene, we can easily diagnose cancer status of a patient and Point of Care (POC) is not that far.\nMultiplexing can also be achieved by emulsion droplets. Since each droplet in microfluidics can act as an isolated independent micro-reactor, droplet provides significantly reduced sample volume as well as high-throughput parallelization with low cost [11]. Also, microfluidic system can be designed to manipulate droplets so that fusion and splitting [12] as well as to sort the droplet can be realized [13]. Figure 5.3b shows the image of fluorescence signals in droplets. By detecting this fluorescence mark, we can sort each cells according to fluorophore target molecules of the cells.\n5 Optics and Fluidics 201\nFluidic environment provides free movement of molecules dissolved in the fluid. This means fluorescence probe also moves freely in the fluid. Pacific Biosciences exploited this freely moving fluidic environment combined with fluorescent-labeled dNTP to perform real-time DNA sequencing from single DNA molecules [14]. Figure 5.3c describes the scheme of one DNA sequencing [15]. First, fluidic environment enables fluorescent-labeled dNTP move freely in reactor, so that no change of solution is needed. Second, fluorescence molecule is excited by zero-mode waveguide, which substantially reduces the observation volume to the surface of the polymerization reaction. A zero-mode waveguide is an optical waveguide that guides light energy into a very small volume, smaller than the wavelength of the light. If fluorescence-labeled dNTP approaches polymerase to be polymerized, then fluorescent dye is excited and this represents just the real-time sequencing at single molecular scale.\nFlourescence molecules also can be attached to biomolecules observe DNA nanostructures using FRET efficiency analysis. Forster resonance energy transfer or FRET describes a mechanism of energy transferring between two chromophores. Depending on the distance between the two chromophore, the emitted fluorescence will differ. For example, Choi et al. has described reconfigurable DNA accordion rack, which changes its shape according to the input DNA locks [16]. Through measuring the FRET efficiency between the two dyes, Choi et al. has described configurability of DNA nanostructures.\nAs you can see in this section, one can construct many more complicated and desired platform by simply designing the microfluidic environment combined with fluorescence detection. Although fluorescence can theoretically be used to detect single molecule, it is hard to obtain single molecule imaging. This is because (1) fluorescence molecules are dissolved but not attached to target molecule and create background noise. (2) Fluorescence also is a visible light so that we can obtain blurred image of emitted fluorescence. There are many researches about enhancing resolution of fluorescence microscopy, which is beyond the scope of this book. But interested readers can study more deeply about advanced techniques of fluorescence microscopy."

      "text" : "Fluorescence, in principle, measures the emission of light from a material after absorption of light to detect a material. By contrast, another light-matter interaction that can be used to detect a material is the scattering of light [17–20]. Especially, Raman spectroscopy has some powerful advantages to study and detect a material. First, in contrast to the emission spectroscopy, Raman spectrometry does not require labels (for example, fluorophore) for detection. Since attachment or labeling of fluorophores is not only laborious, but also can interact with or modify the target molecules and other detecting system. Second, Raman spectroscopy can measure\n202 A. C. Lee et al.\nvibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes in a molecule, which can be a fingerprint of that molecule. Third, Raman spectrometry does not suffer from rapid photobleaching commonly observed in fluorescence spectrometry. Briefly, Raman spectroscopy can be easy, label-free, and non-destructive ways of detecting materials.\nScattering is a physical process where light is forced to deviate from a trajectory they travel due to non-uniformity is that material. Among them, Raman scattering is inelastic scattering of photon, i.e. the scattered photon has a different wavelength from incident photon (Fig. 5.4). This energy difference corresponds to the quantum energy difference between vibrational modes of these molecules. Since vibrational modes are specific to the chemical bonds of the molecule, the spectrum of scattered photon provides the fingerprint of this molecule [17].\nEven though Raman spectroscopy has great advantages, Raman scattering is an extremely inefficient process compared to fluorescence (Its scattering cross-section is smaller than that of fluorescence over fourteen orders of magnitude folds [18]. This means that we should amplify Raman scattering signal in order to increase the sensitivity of the detection. Luckily, there is a phenomenon called SERS (Surface-Enhanced Raman scattering). When light is incident to metal nanoparticle, if incident frequency of light meets the nanoparticles’ surface plasmon resonance condition, it has been known that this surface plasmon induce strong electromagnetic fields near nanoparticle, which significantly amplifies the Raman scattering signals of nearby analyte [21]. In other words, there are two conditions to achieve SERS: (1) specific structure of metal nanoparticle, (2) target analyte should be sufficiently close to that nanoparticle to enable chemical interaction between them. If we manage to achieve these conditions, we can detect materials in single molecule resolution.\n5 Optics and Fluidics 203\nThere are many efforts to achieve SERS satisfying above two conditions. What’s important is that signal enhancement should not only be high and uniform but also reproducible. Selena Chan et al. [22] produced efficient and reliable SERS substrates by coating silver onto nanoporous silicon and achieved seven orders of magnitude Raman enhancement (Fig. 5.5a). D. Lim et al. (2011) produced gold\n204 A. C. Lee et al.\nnanobridged nanogap particles by anchoring DNA and obtained reproducible and sensitive (up to 10 fM for the detection limit) SERS signal (Fig. 5.5b) [23].\nFigure 5.6 depicts Raman and SERS spectra of Phenylalanine. A strong difference between these two spectra is observed. Indeed, an enhancement factor was found and equal to 105. Aside from researches mentioned above, there are many other trials to increase performance of SERS and is under active research [24]. SERS is a promising part of optical detection and is expected that its applications will continuously be extended."

      "text" : "Light has been widely used in micro and nano-systems in fabricating processes, such as photolithography [25]. In microsystems for biological applications, the synergetic integration of optics and fluidics brought significant advances in particle fabrication and in situ polymerization for bioassays. Photodegradable polymers or photocurable monomers, which are used in these processes, are thus gaining interests in bio-industry for their controllability and simplicity [5, 26–30]. There have been a wide variety of efforts to apply this uniqueness of photopolymers in research fields ranging from 3D printing to tissue engineering.\nAccording to Roger Philips, photopolymerization can be categorized into two major classes of chemical reactions [25]. The first class involves photochemically active cross-linking groups that can act as the intermediate excited state. The second class involves an excited photoinitiator molecule to interact with monomer to\ninduce chain reaction to form polymers. The figure above illustrates the second class, where the photoinitiators are split into two or more parts when light source is exposed. The radicals or ions thereof react with the monomers to form polymers (Fig. 5.7). These photocurable materials with different properties can be chosen for specific applications.\nWe designed this section of Optofluidics to concern synthesis using optofluidics. Specifically, photopolymerization, nanocomposites, and their biological applications will be discussed.\nPhotopolymerization itself has been widely used as a tool for biological and biochemical applications. In this chapter, we will open optofluidics in micro/ nano-systems with photopolymerization used for biological applications. Specifically, we will concentrate on the optofluidic lithography systems and its applications.\nPatterning the shapes or the structures with photopolymerization can be applied to a broad range of micro/nano-systems such as particle manipulation, actuators, and assay system using the particles and the actuators [2, 31–38]. Scientists and researchers have developed numerous ways to construct particles or structures with desired shape and function. To realize desired shapes, methods for patterning the light exposure are widely used. The patterned light exposure would activate the curing agents in desired regions. In 2007, Chung and colleagues reported optofluidic maskless lithography (OFML) system for real-time synthesis of photopolymerized microstructures in microfluidic channels [39] (Fig. 5.8).\n206 A. C. Lee et al.\nFrom the UV source, the light is collimated to prevent light diffraction and guide the light rays to the digital micromirror device. Contrast to the traditional photolithography, in which photomasks were used for patterning, digital micromirror device can be controlled with a processor in real-time. The OFML system developed here guides UV light that is selectively reflected to the digital micromirror to the beam splitter. The UV light is then refracted through microscope objective lens to pattern the desired shape in desired scale. They report that they were successful in synthesizing polymeric microstructures with a single pixel resolution of 1.54 lm by 1.54 lm at 0.1 s exposure time. Using such in situ photopolymerization techniques, liquid-phase photocurable materials can be patterned to form anchored and unanchored polymeric structures, widely ranging from valves to micro particles.\nFor example, Kwon’s group from Seoul National University reported guided and fluidic self-assembly of microstructures using railed microfluidic channels. The microstructures were synthesized by in situ OFML system.\n5 Optics and Fluidics 207\nInside the fluidic channels fabricated with soft lithography, photopolymerization could be utilized to fabricate particles in desired shapes (Fig. 5.9). The ultraviolet light, which cures the photopolymers, is modulated via digital micromirror device. The digital micromirror device (DMD) is an optical semiconductor device that utilizes digital light processing module, enabled by the progression in micro-electro-mechanical technology. As the micro-units of these devices are modulated using DMD, the collimated UV light rays can be selectively reflected onto the substrates. Because the micromirrors are dynamic, materials can be cured in different shapes. Another advantage of digital micromirrors is to easy control spatially and temporally the desired to-be-exposed region. Spatial and temporal resolution can be revolutionary because traditional photolithography can be difficult and complex when synthesizing micro-scale structures dynamically. Using this phenomenon, Kwon’s group from Seoul National University fabricated microparticles with different shapes on a micro-rail in situ [40, 41]. On to the railed microfluidic channel, they used UV-DMD system to fabricate particles in different shapes. The particles were used in self-assembly, allowing complex microstructures assembled in fluid. Even though the particles were not different in their functions, the assembly of such different population of particles promises complex functional micro-system, which can be applied to different areas in biotechnology. The most significant point of this development is that parallel fabrication of micro/ nano-devices are possible through this fluidic self-assembly.\nNot only two-dimensional particles can be assembled, but also threedimensional fabrication of heterogeneous microstructures can be fabricated using soft membrane deformation and OFML system (Fig. 5.10). Seung Ah Lee et al. proposed a method for high-throughput generation of three-dimensional\n208 A. C. Lee et al.\nmicrostructures using a membrane mounted microfluidic channel [42]. If the OFML system described above can be utilized to create 2D structures in different layers, 3D microstructures can be fabricated. The group used a soft membrane to control the thickness of each layer, which allows large area projection lithography with high vertical resolution. Using microfluidics, the photocurable material resin can be switched, producing heterogeneous composition of each and every layer of the three dimensional structure. Kwon’s group demonstrated three-dimensional patterning of different types of cells in a hydrogel for a microfluidic platform. This demonstration showed that three-dimensional structures made by OFML can be utilized to study co-culture of cells and cell-to-cell interaction, and perhaps cell-to-tissue interactions. This simple and high-throughput patterning of 3D\n5 Optics and Fluidics 209\nmicrostructures would have an impact to produce heterogeneous biomaterials with various shapes.\nThe same group also reported fine-tuned gray-scale OFML for three-dimensional freeform shape microstructure fabrication. On top of the three dimensional fabrication, they utilized gray shade levels, that are modulated through multiple reflections of light in the DMD. Another implementation of photopolymerization in microfluidic device is a synthesis of membrane-type microvalves in rectangular microfluidic channels via seal photopolymerization (Fig. 5.11). Microfluidic devices have revolutionized bioassays, as the fluid mechanics in micro world have characteristics that can be utilized in bioassays. This work implemented photopolymerization to develop the limitations of microfluidic valves that can control the flow in integrated microfluidic circuits. Microvalves usually are made of membranes that can be seal the microchannel as the gas pressure pushes out the membrane. The idea of this work is that through controlled polymerization enabled by photocurable resin, the channels can be sealed via polymerization by photolithography, producing a structure matching the shape of the deformed membrane curvature [43]. This piece of art has enabled accurate sealing of microvalves, which are widely used in cell sorting, fluid control, and other biological assays.\nUsing in situ optofluidic photopolymerization, three-dimensional fluidic self-assembly by axis translation is also possible. Chung et al. used two dimensionally fabricated micro-components in railed microfluidics to produce three-dimensional structures (Fig. 5.12).\n210 A. C. Lee et al.\nUsing OFML, desired 2D structure was cured in the fabrication area, as indicated in the figure. The 2D structure is then raised by the premade bump for axis-translation and assembly [44] (Fig. 5.13).\nConclusion\nIn this section, we have introduced methods that are possible with the optofluidic structure synthesis alone. 2D and 3D structures can be synthesized and assembled using the photopolymerization and variety of bioassays or mimetics of biological phenomena, which can be performed by utilizing the advantages of optofluidic synthesis methods."

      "text" : "The great advantage of in situ photopolymerization is that the photocurable resin can incorporate other materials [2, 36–38]. Materials, such as DNA, antibody, magnetic nanoparticles, and more can be encapsulated in situ by photopolymerization. The various shapes of particles and structures can provide advantage in biological applications in many ways. Nanocomposites are the photocurable\n5 Optics and Fluidics 211\npolymer structures encapsulating nano-sized materials. This section will mainly be consisted of nanocomposites that can be or are being utilized in biological applications.\nOptofluidic encapsulation of nano-materials as well as micro-materials can be applied in many ways. Song et al. has described liquid-capped encoded microcapsules for multiplex assays which can encapsulate thousands of liquids inside a core-shell structures, which are assembled onto a microchip for diagnosis and examination [45]. Chung et al. introduced optofluidic encapsulation and manipulation of silicon microchips using image processing based optofluidic maskless lithography and railed microfluidics [41, 42] (Fig. 5.14). Specifically, this work showed the integration of a fluidic channel, encapsulation, fin fabrication, guide channels, and assembly. This platform would be a platform to manipulate microscale devices and self-assemble in order to form large-scale systems. This would not only be applied to the field of display, but also to the particle based biosensors.\nStructures at micron-scale, such as silicon chips, can be encapsulated in the photocurable polymers. Interestingly, if photolithography technique such as OFML, which uses DMD, is employed, nano-materials can be encapsulated in even smaller particles or structures. For example, Hyoki Kim et al. have used superparamagnetic colloidal nanocrystal clusters (CNCs), which are comprised of single-domain\n212 A. C. Lee et al.\nmagnetite nanocrystals (Fig. 5.15). These microparticles, which contain nanocrystals inside silica shells, can form chain-like structures along the external magnetic field lines. When aligned in chain, the color of the light diffracted from the chain is determined by Bragg diffraction theory. Kim et al. have employed these characteristics to cure the resin mixed with superparamagnetic CNCs [46, 47] (Fig. 5.17). When desired external magnetic field is applied, the CNC chains will form to diffract desired color (Fig. 5.16). Because the color would be removed when the external magnetic field is suppressed, the photocurable resin could be cured in order to fix the CNC chain. The fixed chain would fix the structural color of the cured material, thus given the name: M-ink. M-ink can be used in color-coding the particles that are used in biological applications. Applying the unique characteristic of the optofluidic synthesis methods enabled M-ink nanocomposite.\nOne of the advantages of this nanocomposite is that the particles can rotate when different external magnetic forces are applied to the fixed magnetic axes of the particle. The rotation can provide faster and larger surface contact inside the solution, possibly increasing the efficiency of different bioassays inside the sample fluid.\nThe same group has applied this idea in multiplexed DNA detection. High-throughput and multiplexed bioassays are realized through optofluidically synthesized magnetic particles [48]. These encoded microparticles allowed to identify distinct codes on assay particles in the pool of diverse samples. The figure shows the reflection micrographs of three different particles with different DNA oligomer probes and multiplexed analysis based on DNA oligomer target\n5 Optics and Fluidics 213\n214 A. C. Lee et al.\nhybridization. The code region and probe region are segregated, for detection of codes for hybridization assays. Through this platform, the group has developed a novel method that can encode billions of different codes. The optofluidic manner of synthesizing such nanocomposites can be scalable, high-throughput and straightforward, opening a new possibility to new multiplexed bioassays.\n5 Optics and Fluidics 215\nMagnetic particles can also be compartmentalized using this optofluidic lithography technique [49] (Fig. 5.18).\nThe group sequentially exposed the particle, changing the direction of the applied magnetic field. The resulting particle cured has two different compartments, of which structure colors are different.\nRegular magnetic nanocomposite microspheres can be made using droplet microfluidics [50] (Fig. 5.19). A microfluidic valve controlled by gas pressure can insert M-ink reservoir inside the stream of mineral oil to be encapsulated. The M-ink microsphere droplet is then transferred to a wider channel, where the magnetic field is modulated and photopolymer composites are cured.\n216 A. C. Lee et al.\nWe introduced some examples of magnetic nanocomposites synthesized optofluidically, which can form structural colors for barcoding. Barcoding enables a wide range of high-throughput bioassays in scalable and less expensive manner. However, the magnetic force such as translational magnetic force or magnetic torque can be utilized. Chung et al. have introduced an in situ fabrication and actuation of polymer magnetic microstructures [51] (Fig. 5.20).\nPhotocurable material is mixed with superparamagnetic CNCs and dispersed inside a PDMS channel. The PDMS channel has an opening so that the material is in contact with the bare glass. When cured, the photocurable material will form an anchor. When the cured object is anchored, and when the right magnetic field is applied, the cured nanocomposite will actuate. The movements of these actuators could be expected when the magnetic torque is calculated.\n5 Optics and Fluidics 217\nThe same phenomenon applies to magnetic actuators developed by Kim et al. Magnetic anisotropy can be programmed easily and readily when using photopolymerization [52] (Fig. 5.21). Patterns can be generated via DMD modulator to produce versatile patterns. Polymeric micro-components are widely used in MEMS devices, but components that can actuate complex motions have not been developed. Using this technique, many complex static microstructures can be fabricated. The microstructures synthesized can be programmed in actuation when the right sequential magnetic axes are formed by external magnetic field, which is applied to the superparamagnetic CNC chains.\nConclusion\nNanocomposites that can be easily generated using optofluidic synthesis methods are attractive in that their shapes, colors, magnetic properties, biological properties, and chemical properties can be modulated using diverse strategies. The field will continue to progress, and more biological and chemical assays would be possible."

      "text" : "In this section, we will look into some of the biological applications of particles or structures synthesized in optofluidic manner.\nA good example for applying optofluidic photopolymerization technique is a demonstration given by Kim et al. [53] (Fig. 5.22). They have developed a high resolution polymer fabrication method based on the OFML system for in situ charge selective nanoporous hydrogel fabrication in a glass microchannel.\n218 A. C. Lee et al.\nUsing photopolymerization, they added micro-components of poly-AMPS [(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesultonic acid)]. This component forms negatively charged nanoporous hydrogel and acts as cation-selective filter for biological sample preconcentration.\nAnother example includes generation of microcups using the same OFML setup. These microcups can act as 3D hydrogel cell microcarriers that can be manipulated easily. The authors show that different microcarriers are labeled with different fluorescence and shapes, which can encode the each cell carriers. One can additionally imagine nanocomposite microcarriers that have different extrinsic properties. In that manner, the optofluidically-synthesized microcarriers can be an excellent technique to address cell-based bioassay in high throughput manner [54] (Fig. 5.23).\n5 Optics and Fluidics 219\nIn addition to cell carriers, these hydrophobic oligomers synthesized in situ can function as picoliter droplet carriers [55] (Fig. 5.24). Hydrophobic oligomer, TMPTA, [trimethyloporpane triacrylate] is cured using OFML setup. Then, after washing out the hydrophobic oligomer resin, Hydrophilic oligomer, PEG-DA [polyethylene glycol) using these liquid handlers can be used in multiplexed bioassays in small volume. Multiplexing the liquid in these micro-liquid handlers could be applied to different types of biological assays that require small volumes.\nLee et al. have developed polymer based chemical delivery to multichannel capillary patterned cells [56] (Fig. 5.25). The group used acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) as a model chemical released to the cells. AHL-laden hydrogels were synthesized through photopolymerization. This is an example of nanocomposite that combines the photopolymers with nano-biochemistry. The nanoporous hydrogel will release AHL slowly, affecting the E. coli that is prepared inside the\n220 A. C. Lee et al.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n5 Optics and Fluidics 221\nshallow channel. The advantage of this method is that the reacting channels are chemically isolated flow through environment.\nAnother example of the particles can be a QR code particle developed by Han et al. [57] (Fig. 5.26). In their paper, they report polymer microtaggant patterned with QR code.\nSo far, we have looked at generation of structures, structural components, and particles using optofluidic lithography. In situ photopolymerization can realize multiplex and high throughput bioassays that were impossible. However, more techniques that can actually control and handle these millions of small reactors. We want to conclude this chapter by introducing a method of handling these particles.\nThe method is called “partipetting” which mixes the terminology particles and pipetting [58, 59] (Fig. 5.27). The method allows scalable multiplexed bioassay in a single swap as demonstrated in the figure. The encoded particles, which we already have introduced above, can be oriented in each well for further analysis. The assays can be done on top of the platform and decoded for identifying the micro-scale reactors. We expect this field to grow more, as there are infinitely different strategies possible for convenient, fast, and low-cost bioassays using optofluidic fabrication. For example, if partipetting is used, particles with certain shapes can be assembled into the corresponding well with the indentations with reciprocal shape. This method was defined as hierarchical shape-by-shape assembly of microparticles for micromete-scale viral delivery of two different genes [60]. Also this technique has been applied to point-of-care immunoassay device called ELIPatch [61]. ELIPatch is a thumbnail-sized patch with immunospot array for multiplexed protein detection from human skin surface.\nSummary\nIn this chapter, we introduced synthesis using optofluidic phenomena. We first described photopolymerization and tools that can use this phenomenon. Then, we looked deeply into nanocomposites that can be synthesized using in situ photopolymerization and some biological applications of these systems. By integrating the advantages of optics and microfluidics, optofluidic synthesis synergistically can provide various useful tools to the scientists and engineers.\nJFig. 5.24 Processes for fabricating the amphiphilic microcarriers in a microfluidic channel: a Injection of hydrophobic oligomer (TMPTA) into a microfluidic channel followed by UV illumination in a hexagonal shape with a center hole for the hexagonal outer structure.

      "text" : "Laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Stimulated emission differs from typical photon energy generation process, spontaneous emission, in some aspects.\nWhen an atom acquires energy from other energy sources like phonons, electrons in the atom are transferred to a higher energy level. But, the electrons in this energy state are unstable. Therefore, naturally, the electrons would decay to the lower energy level again. This decaying process of the electrons makes radiation of light, which has the same amount of energy as the difference between two energy levels (higher and lower). When excitation energy source is also a light, the incident light and radiated light will have the same frequency. But, they are independent in phase and direction. In other words, two types of light (incident light and radiated light) will have different phase and direction. This is the typical light generation process, called spontaneous emission. However, light emissions from excited atoms can be stimulated. This phenomenon is called stimulated emissions. Stimulated emission differs from spontaneous emission in the aspect of coherence. The picture below represents the stimulated emission (Fig. 5.28).\nSuppose that there is an electron existing in the excited energy level, and energy gap between the excited energy level and the grounded energy level amounts to ΔE. If the energy of an incident photon, hv, is same as ΔE, decaying of the electron in excited energy level is stimulated. The stimulated decaying process invokes the\n226 A. C. Lee et al.\nradiation of photon having the same amount of energy as ΔE. Now, there are two photons, one is the incident photon and the other is radiated photon. This is the stimulated emission. The important thing in this phenomenon is that two photons will have the same frequency, direction and phase.\nAs you can see from its name, LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is the device that amplifies light by using stimulated emission. Because lasers use lights from stimulated emission, the amplified lights in laser have the same frequency, direction, and phase. This coherence in three components gives a laser with two special properties: spatial and temporal coherences. Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography. Temporal coherence allows a laser to emit light with a very narrow spectrum. These two special properties of a laser mean that a laser can focus a light having a specific amount of energy to a very tight spot. This property of a laser makes it useful for the very-small-volumemanipulation in a microfluidic system.\nFigure 5.29 represents the structure of a typical laser. A laser consists of 4 main components. Those are gain medium, pumping energy, output coupler, and high reflector. Gain medium is where stimulated emission occurs. The atoms in a gain medium get energy to excite their electrons from a pumping energy, such as electricity or light. Then, from the process of stimulated emission, lights are produced, and the lights generated from stimulated emission are reflected two mirrors, the high reflector and the output coupler. While reflecting between the two mirrors, lights interfere with itself and other lights having other frequency constructively or destructively. As a result, lights having a specific frequency survive and form some number of modes. By repeating this process, lights are amplified. And through the output coupler, amplified lights are emitted. For this purpose, output coupler is transparent.\n5 Optics and Fluidics 227"

      "text" : "Mentioned above, lasers can be used for an energy source to a tight spot [62–65]. This spatially high-resolution photon energy can be used to retrieve specific samples from a microfluidic system. There are some applications that use lasers for selection in microfluidic devices.\nSniper Cloning\nWhen we want to synthesize long DNA, numerous DNA fragments are needed for the bottom-up assembly. These DNA fragments have to be sequence-verified to make the correctly assembled DNAs. However, because of the current limitation of coupling efficiency (<99.5%) in solid-phase synthesis of oligonucleotides, it is very hard to obtain the sequence-verified DNAs by that method. Suppose that we have 0.5% per base, only 1 DNA block out of 100 DNA blocks will have the right sequence, the other 99 DNA blocks will have wrong sequence. This problem concerning error-rate in synthesized DNA blocks makes writing DNAs more difficult. There is a solution by using laser in microfluidic system, called Sniper Cloning [66, 67] (Fig. 5.30). In Sniper Cloning, we first verify the sequence of the DNA blocks by using 454-junior sequencing device. In that platform, we use micro-beads containing DNAs to verify the sequence of DNAs. Beads contain 1\n228 A. C. Lee et al.\nDNA clone, and 1 bead exists in a well, and this is done by adjusting the size of wells. 454-junior sequencing machine detects the fluorescence from the beads in the sequencing process. After sequencing the blocks, one knows where DNA blocks having the correct sequence are. The remaining task is to retrieve DNA blocks with the correct sequence. Because the sizes of the wells and beads are micro-scale, we need high-resolution retrieval method. The method employed in this platform is using light from the lasers. Mentioned above, the light from lasers can be focused in a very tiny spot, transferring kinetic energy of photons to that spot. Knowing where the correct DNAs are, we move the laser to that spot, and generate pulsed laser beam to the well containing the correct DNA block. The kinetic energy of photons make bead separated from the well, and this bead is dropped to the 96-well plate for further manipulation of the DNA blocks. The figure below represents the main concepts of Sniper Cloning.\nGreen lines are lights from a laser, having wavelength of 532 nm. This amplified light passes through a lens, and are focused to a tight spot. By adjusting the distance between the lens and the chip that was used for the sequencing of DNAs, diameter of the light can be matched to the well size. Each well has one bead containing one clone of DNA. The wall of wells guides the incident light, then this guided light eventually hits the bead containing correct sequence that we will use for some purposes. This bead containing sequence-verified DNAs falls into one well of a 96-well plate below the sequencing chip. After we purify the beads in the 96-well plate, we can get sequence verified DNAs.\nSelective Retrieval in Dynamic Microarray\nThere is another selective retrieval approach by using lasers. Figure 5.31a explains the main concept of this device [68]. When a particle is moving through the microfluidic channel in this device, there are two possible paths for the particle. Path 1 is to the well that has the size for just one particle and the other is the main stream toward the exit of this device. For some fluid mechanical reasons, the fluidic resistance of path 1 is smaller than the fluidic resistance of path 2. So particles can be trapped in the well easily. After some experiments to the trapped samples, selective retrieval is done by using a laser. When laser is radiated to the cavity beside of the well containing the target particle, fluid in the spot evaporates and forms a bubble. The pressure caused by the formation of the bubble makes the target particle join to the main stream of this fluidic device again. The high resolution of lasers makes this selective retrieval possible. Using other technologies, like encapsulation of the samples, can prevent possible damages from this focused energy of lasers [69].\n5 Optics and Fluidics 229"

In fact, the human body is mainly composed of liquid medium (water) where charged particles (such as sodium or chloride atoms, proteins) can flow. Under electric field, this ionic composition induces a current flow, which can be monitored. Concerning the biological cell, the lipid bilayer of cellular membrane behaves as an electrical insulator and thus modifies the flow path of the ions in relation with the cellular state, localization and numbers. Furthermore, the water is a dielectric material and its polarization also interacts with the electric field. Thus the human body, organ or cell can be seen as complex electrolyte within which the electric field can be used to sense or act on polarizable particles.\nIn this chapter, the physics of electrokinetic phenomena will be first presented and applied at nano-scale. Applications will be then depicted concerning handling and sensing cells using dielectrophoresis within lab-on-chip.

      "text" : "There has been considerable interest over the past decade in the science and engineering of fluid transport at micrometer and nanometer scales [1–4]. Advances in micro- and nano-electromechanical system (MEMS and NEMS) technology over the past few decades have allowed miniaturized devices to be developed for various micro- and nano-fluidic applications. These miniaturized platforms offer significant advantages compared to conventional bulk analytical instruments: they support precise control of liquids flowing usually under laminar regime, minimize consumption of reagents and samples, favor short reaction times, enable highly parallel and multiplexed analysis, require less power to operate, and potentially have low cost of production [1]. For these advantages, electrokinetic mechanisms have been usually used as the preferred method of transporting fluids in the miniaturized systems because of the ease and low cost of electrode fabrication, excluding moving mechanical parts, and the significant effect of the electric double layer\n236 H. Lee et al.\nwhich is the thin polarized layer in the liquid adjacent to the charged surface. Due to these reasons, many seminal works to describe the electrokinetic phenomena in microscale system have been established [1, 5–7].\nNevertheless, electrokinetic phenomena in nanoscale system are not still obvious. In the nanoscale system, the electric double layer would be overlapped so that its equilibrium structure could not be maintained under external driving field [8, 9] called as non-equilibrium state. Conventional theories for microscale system are only applicable to the electric double layer under equilibrium limit. In addition, several factors, usually neglected in microscale system, could play an important role for nanoscale transport phenomena when the system dimension decreased. For example, hydrodynamic slip on solid surface could be occurred [10, 11], while “no slip” condition is usually applied in microscale system. In viewpoints of conventional theories, fluid molecules were attached to solid surface so that they could not move. This is known as ‘no-slip condition’ on liquid-solid interfaces. However, in actual system, fluid molecules on the interface are not attached to the interface strongly so that they could be movable. This is called as slippage of fluid molecule. Due to this slippage, ionic current could be higher than the value predicted by conventional theories for microscale system. Another example among unique properties of nanofluidic system is ‘surface-charge-governed conductance’. Ionic transport in nanofluidic systems have the unique property of surface-chargegoverned regime as demonstrated by Stein et al. [12]. In a dilute limit, ionic conductance is independent from the bulk properties of the system such as the electrolyte concentration or the geometrical factor, so that the conductance curve saturates below a specific concentration value, which is determined by surface charge density and called ‘surface-charge-governed conductance’. Because the plateau of the conductance curve is only revealed in a nanochannel system, this property has been utilized to demonstrate the validity of the device in the view point of nanofluidic application. Beyond the specific concentration value, the conductance is proportional to the bulk concentration, called ‘geometry-governed regime’. These two distinct regimes can be plotted (ionic conductance as a function of bulk concentrations) simultaneously. Since these unique properties were usually neglected in microscale electrokinetic analysis, direct application of the conventional theory could cause non-negligible errors in nanoscale electrokinetic analysis. Thus, aims of recent researches in nanoscale electrokinetics were (1) finding new constraints to describe the unique property of nanoscale, which has never been observed in microfluidic system, (2) establishing the modified model using the new constraints, and (3) predicting the phenomena, which are difficult to observe by experimental manner. To exemplify these concerns, the contents of this book focused on nanoscale electrokinetic transport phenomena inside the nanoscale system (ionic field effect transistor, a.k.a IFET) and nearby the system (ion concentration polarization, a.k.a. ICP) which are the most relevant phenomenon occurs in the biological system, especially inside human body.\nAt first, governing equations and appropriate boundary conditions for the nanoscale system were revisited from general conservation principle as written in Sect. 6.2.2. In this chapter, fundamental equations such as the Poisson equation, the\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 237\nNernst-Planck equations, Stokes equations, and the continuity equation could be found, which are used as governing equations in other chapters.\nIn Sect. 6.2.4, the model to describe ion concentration polarization (ICP) phenomenon was discussed. The micro-nano hybrid system, which is composed of microchannel reservoir—perm-selective nanoporous membrane—microchannel reservoir and also resembled the cellular structure, has unique phenomenon of as ICP. Through the perm-selective nanoporous media, only counter-ion can be transported across the media while co-ion cannot. Because of the selectivity of transported species, ion concentration is decrease on one side (this is called ‘depletion’), while on the other side ion concentration is increase (this is called ‘enrichment’). This is called as ‘ion concentration polarization’. For various applications such as desalination [13], preconcentration [14], and battery system [15, 16], the concentration distribution inside the depletion and enrichment zone should be the key feature to apply these applications.\nFurthermore, we suggested the model to describe the gate modulation in the partially gated ionic field effect transistor. The ionic field effect transistor (IFET) as a nanofluidic device could change the polarity of the nanochannel or nanopore so that the permselectivity, unique property of nanoscale system, which permits only counter-ion pass through the nanoscale system, could be controlled. Using this functionality, switching of macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins [17] or ionic species such as cation and anion [18, 19] could be possible. In the field of IFET research, the description for the polarity modulation by gate electrode in IFET has been an important issue."

Because the typical electrokinetic system involves a fluid motion u with ionic species which have electric charge, independent variables such as electric potential w, concentration of each ionic species cj and hydrodynamic pressure p should be required for the characterization of the system. Each independent variable is related to the conservation principle; (1) the electric potential is related to conservation of electric charge, (2) concentration of ionic species is associated with the conservation of mass, and (3) hydrodynamic pressure and flow field is connected with the conservation of mass and momentum. Therefore, in this chapter, governing equations and boundary conditions for electrokinetic system will be introduced from a viewpoint of conservation principles under the continuum framework which is held down to a length scale greater than 1 nm [10]. Although some other models have been proposed to try to integrate the discrete effect of ion transport or fluid flow in the continuum frameworks with an extra term [20] or by adapting the results of molecular dynamics [21], continuum hypothesis still remain intact in most electrokinetic system.\n238 H.

The electrostatic forces arising from the interactions between them plays essential role in the transport phenomena in the electrokinetic system. In order to describe the electrostatic system, the governing equation and appropriate boundary conditions will be introduced briefly.\nThe Maxwell’s equations are not limited to the electrostatic system. The equations relate the electric field E and the magnetic field H to material properties, the charge density, and conservation principles. The full set of Maxwell’s equations in general form is\nr D ¼ qf ð6:1Þ\nr B ¼ 0 ð6:2Þ\nr E ¼ @B @t\nð6:3Þ\nand\nr H ¼ @D @t þ Jf : ð6:4Þ\nHere, D is the electric displacement vector, qf is the free charge density, B is the magnetic induction field, E is the electric field, H is the magnetic field, and Jf is the conduction current density associated with the movement of free charge. For a linear and homogeneous dielectric medium, the following constitutive relationship can be written\nD ¼ eE ð6:5Þ\nand\nB ¼ lH ð6:6Þ\nwhere e is the dielectric permittivity and l is the magnetic permeability of the medium. Utilizing Eqs. (6.5) and (6.6), the Maxwell equations can be written for a linear homogeneous dielectric medium as\nr E ¼ qf e\nð6:7Þ\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 239\nr H ¼ 0 ð6:8Þ\nr E ¼ l @H @t\nð6:9Þ\nand\nr H ¼ e @E @t þ Jf : ð6:10Þ\nIt is clear from the above equations that when the electric field varies with time, one needs to consider the magnetic field as well. In this case, the equations governing the electric and magnetic fields are coupled. However, in most of electrokinetic system, the effect of the magnetic field can be negligible or the system is under static case i.e. the absence of time variation so that electric field can be decoupled from the magnetic field. Therefore, the Maxwell’s equations for describing the typical electrokinetic system can be reduced in the following form:\nr E ¼ qf e\nð6:11Þ\nr E ¼ 0: ð6:12Þ\nBecause the electric field is curl-free, electric field can be represented by gradient of scalar quantity w known as electric potential. Hence, the governing equation for conservation of electric charge is\nr ðerwÞ ¼ qe ð6:13Þ\nwith the fundamental relationship between the irrotational field and the scalar potential as\nE ¼ rw: ð6:14Þ\nNext, we will briefly introduce the appropriate boundary conditions for electrostatic problems. For electrostatic systems, the Gauss law can be applied to the boundary between two domains to determine the boundary conditions for the normal and tangential components of the electric field. The Gauss law relates the electric field through a closed surface to the enclosed charge and can be denoted asI\nS E ndS ¼ Q e ð6:15Þ\nwhere S is bounded surface of arbitrary volume V, n is the outward normal to the surface S, and Q is the total charge inside the volume V. Given an interface with a\n240 H. Lee et al.\ncharge per unit area given by rs, separating two domains labeled 1 and 2 with two permittivity of e1 and e2, respectively, the boundary condition for the normal component of the electric field is given by\ne1E1 n1 e2E2 n2 ¼ rs: ð6:16Þ\nIn the above expression, the direction of n1 points from domain 2 to domain 1. A line integral over a loop at the boundary gives the following boundary condition for any tangent component of the electric field;\nE1 t ¼ E2 t: ð6:17Þ\nEquation (6.17) holds for any unit vector tangent to the surface. Boundary conditions (6.16) and (6.17) can be represented in terms of electric potential so that\ne1 @w1 @n1 þ e2 @w2 @n2 ¼ rs ð6:18Þ\nand\nw1 ¼ w2 ð6:19Þ\nwhich are hold at the interface between two domain. There are widely used boundary conditions for microscale or nanoscale electrokinetic system. For a reservoir or electrode surface where the electric potential is applied, the electric potential is specified.\nwjreservoir¼ V0 ð6:20Þ\nwhere V0 is the specified value of the applied potential. Because reservoirs of microdevice are typically considered as an enormous source of ions compared with the microchannels themselves, any voltage drop can be neglected between the electrode and the inlet or outlet to the microchannel. For an insulating wall that has surface charge density rs, Eq. (6.18) is simplified because the electric field in the insulating wall (E2) normal to the surface is approximately zero. Thus the normal boundary condition is a relation between the surface charge density and the potential gradient normal to the surface,\n@w @n\nwall\n¼ rs e : ð6:21Þ\nTypically, the material of the channel is SiO2, Al2O3, or PDMS of which relative permittivity is lower than 10 so that channel wall can be treated as insulating material and Eq. (6.21) is a reasonable approximation. When the relative\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 241\npermittivity of the channel wall cannot be neglected or the electrostatics inside the solid is important, Eqs. (6.18) and (6.19) should be used together. These are summarized in Table in Sect. 6.2.2.4."

      "text" : "This section describes the phenomena that lead to flux of charged ionic species in the dilute limit. These fluxes lead to the Nernst-Planck equations. Although certain conditions, i.e. high concentration and high applied voltage, would violate the dilute approximation, we will discuss only the conservation of mass in the dilute limit. The effect of the non-dilute condition will be reconsidered in Sect. 6.2.4 because the effect cannot be negligible in nanometer scale system.\nFirstly, we will consider the diffusion flux of the ionic species when concentration gradient is existed. In the dilute limit, Fick’s law defines a flux density of species proportional to the gradient of the species concentration and the diffusivity of the species in the solvent as\njdiff;i ¼ Dirci ð6:22Þ\nwhere jdiff,i is the diffusive species flux density i.e. the amount of species i moving across a surface per unit area due to diffusion, Di is the diffusivity of species i in the solvent (usually water), and ci is the concentration of species i. Fick’s law is a macroscopic way of representing the summed effect of the random motion of species owing to thermal fluctuations. Fick’s law for thermal energy flux caused by a temperature gradient and the Newtonian model for momentum flux induced by a velocity gradient, and the species diffusivity Di is analogous to the thermal diffusivity a = k/q Cp and the momentum diffusivity η/q.\nSecond flux is the convective flux of the ionic species when there is an ambient fluid flow. Its form is\njconv;i ¼ ciu ð6:23Þ\nwhere jconv,i is the convective species flux density i.e. the amount of species i moving across a surface per unit area due to an ambient fluid flow u.\nThird flux is the migration flux of the ionic species due to an external force such as electric field in usual electrokinetic system. The migration flux can act differently on different species in general. Let us denote the force acting on one ionic species by Fext, which is applied external force. The ionic species will move under the influence of this external force, and one can write its migration velocity Vi as\nvi ¼ xiFext ð6:24Þ\n242 H. Lee et al.\nwhere xi is defined as the mobility of the species (velocity per unit applied force). The migration flux can be defined as\njmig;i ¼ civi ¼ cixiFext: ð6:25Þ\nAt this point, we need to interpret themobilityxi, whichwas introduced in Eq. (6.24). Normally, application of a force to a mass causes it to accelerate so that assigning a constant velocity to the particle as in Eq. (6.24) seems counter-intuitive. However, it should be noted that as soon as a solute particle starts to move under the influence of the external force, it encounters a counteracting drag force due to the other particles (predominantly solvent) surrounding it. Consequently, it is assumed that the solute particle moves at a terminal velocity attained under the combined influence of the external force and the frictional drag force of the surrounding medium.

      "text" : "In this section, we discuss the Stokes equation for the conservation of momentum and the continuity equation. In typical electrokinetic system, there are fluid flows induced by ion movement driven by external forces. Thus, fluid motion should be considered and this is governed by the conservation of momentum. The Reynolds number of usual microscale or nanoscale electrokinetic system is low so that\n244 H. Lee et al.\nviscous forces dominate over inertial forces. As a result, the Navier-Stokes equations can be reduced to the Stokes equations which are linear differential equations so that the Stokes equations are easier to solve than the Navier-Stokes equations.\nThe flow of the Newtonian fluid system under laminar flow conditions with constant density and viscosity is governed by the momentum conservation equation and is given by the Navier-Stokes equations [22].\nq @u @t þ qu ru ¼ rpþ gr2uþ qgþFb: ð6:35Þ\nEquation (6.35) represents the force balance on a fluid element in space. Here q is the density of the fluid, t is the time, u is the flow velocity field, p is the pressure, η is the viscosity of the fluid, g is the gravitational acceleration, and Fb is the body force acting on the fluid element in addition to the gravity. In electrokinetic transport processes, one needs to consider the electrical body force acting on the fluid. Further discussion on the electrical body force will be presented later in this section.\nEach term of Eq. (6.35) represents forces acting on a unit volume of the fluid. The first term on the left hand side represents the rate of change of momentum at a given location within the flow field. For steady conditions, this term drops out. The second term is due to the fluid inertia and is negligible for low Reynolds number flows [23] and this will be shown in later. The first term of the right hand side represents the contribution of pressure, the second term is due to viscous forces, the third term arises from the body force due to gravity, and the last term arises from other body force which is usually electrical body force in the electrokinetic system. Equation (6.35) can be written for any orthogonal coordinate system [22].\nAlthough the conservation of momentum can be described by the Navier-Stokes equations, it is difficult to solve the equations because of nonlinearity of the inertial term. Thus, we derive the Stokes equations by neglecting the unsteady and inertial terms when the viscous force is dominant. Equation (6.35) is rewritten in non-dimensional form in which the length scale is Lc, the velocity scale is Uc, the pressure scale is η Uc/Lc, and the time scale is Lc/Uc.\nRe @~u @~t þ ~u ereu ¼ er~pþ er2~uþ ~gþ ~Fb: ð6:36Þ Above expression is non-dimensional form of the Navier-Stokes equations. A tilde denotes dimensionless variable. Re is the Reynolds number, defined by Re = qUcLc/η of which meaning is the ratio of inertial force and viscous force acting on a fluid element. Considering the microscale or nanoscale electrokinetic system, Re is usually much smaller than 1 so that Re can be approximated to 0. Therefore, the left hand side of Eq. (6.36) is negligible. Consequently, following equations are called as Stokes equations with body force terms.\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 245\n0 ¼ rpþ gr2uþ qgþFb: ð6:37Þ\nFor convenience, the term of gravity force merge into pressure so that modified pressure is usually used rather than original hydrodynamic pressure.\nAs earlier discussed, the momentum equation given by Eq. (6.37) contains a generic body force term, Fb which can be used to consider any type of force acting on a fluid volume element. In electrokinetic transport processes, this body force arises due to an electric field. The electric body force per unit volume on the fluid, FE is given by [24]\nFE ¼ qfE 1 2 E Ereþ 1 2 r q @e @q T E E\nð6:38Þ\nwhich is derived from the Korteweig-Helmholtz electric for a linear dielectric medium.

(6.37), we obtain the following governing equations for conservation of momentum in the electrokinetic system as\n0 ¼ rpþ gr2u qfrw: ð6:41Þ\nAdditionally, the mass conservation for a fluid is also required to solve the Stokes equations. The general form of the mass conservation for the fluid is given by [24]\n@q @t þr ðquÞ ¼ 0: ð6:42Þ\nFor the incompressible fluid, the density of the fluid is constant so that\nr u ¼ 0 ð6:43Þ\nwhich is called as the continuity equation for the incompressible fluid. Equations (6.41) and (6.43) are the governing equations for usual electrokinetic system.\n246 H. Lee et al.\nThe Stokes equations and the continuity equation can be solved after setting appropriate boundary conditions corresponding to a given flow situation. The boundary conditions can specify the velocities or pressures at given locations of the flow boundary. Of particular interest with respect to boundary conditions for these equations is the no-slip condition, which is generally applied at the solid boundaries and this condition is\nujboundary¼ U0 ð6:44Þ\nwhere U0 is the specified velocity. The no-slip condition implies that the fluid in contact with a solid object moves at the same velocity as the object. If the object is stationary such as the wall of microchannel, then the fluid velocity is zero at the surface. Imposition of the no-slip condition usually sets up a velocity gradient in the fluid near the solid-fluid interfaces. Such a gradient gives rise to a viscous stress. The local hydrodynamic stress tensor at a point on the surface on the solid surface is given by\nrH ¼ pIþ g ruþruT ð6:45Þ where rH is the hydrodynamic stress tensor, I is the unit tensor, the superscript T means the transpose of the tensor, and the final term on the right hand side represents the viscous stresses. This hydrodynamic stress can be integrated over the surface of the solid object to determine the total hydrodynamic force acting on the object."

      "text" : "Electroosmosis is the motion of liquid induced by an applied electric potential across a porous material, capillary tube, membrane, microchannel, or any other fluid conduit. It is an essential component in separation science, especially capillary electrophoresis. It can occur in natural unfiltered water, human body fluid, buffer solutions and highly concentrated brine as well. Discovered by F. F. Reuss in 1809, water migrated through porous clay diaphragms toward the cathode under the influence of electric field since mineral particles are generally negatively charged. The physics behind electroosmosis is shown in the schematics (Fig. 6.2). Once solid conduit was filled with electrolyte solution, ions in the solution attack the surface so that the surface become to have electrical charges. The charges attract counter-ions to form a thin electrical double layer which has counter-ion rich region, while the center (or bulk) of the conduit remains electro-neutral status. With an external electric potential gradient, the ions inside the electrical double layer migrated toward their counter electrode and the water in the conduit is drawn by the ions due to viscous drag and therefore, flows through the conduit. This situation was governed by Navier-Stokes equations with electrical body forces as\nq @u @t þ u ru ¼ rpþ lr2uþ qgþ qeE: ð6:46Þ\nSince the conduit where the drag forces dominant to induce electroosmosis has under microscale dimension, the equations is simplified in a steady Stokes flow with electrical body force, with neglecting gravity force and pressure gradient as\nlr2u ¼ qeE: ð6:47Þ\n250 H.

However, the thin double layer approximation is no longer valid when the electrolyte concentration is extremely diluted or the size of conduit become comparable to the thickness of electrical double layer which has the range of 1–100 nm. The second scenario generally occurs in nanoscale electrokinetics and most of assumption, governing equations and boundary conditions of equilibrium electroosmosis should be modified as non-equilibrium (or the second kind of) electroosmosis."

      "text" : "Permselective Nanoporous Membrane System\nRecently, the ion concentration polarization (ICP) phenomena, which are occurred nearby the nanojunction or nanoporous membrane, have drawn significant attention in a variety of applications such as desalination [13], preconcentration [25], analytical sensors [14], and fuel cells [16]. When the nanochannel is thinner than 100 nm, it has the permselectivity, unique property of nanoscale system, due to the fact that the Debye layer thickness (kD) is non-negligible compared with the channel thickness so that the overlap of Debye layer could be happened [24, 26, 27]. Through the permselective nanoporous media, only counter-ion can be transported across the media while co-ion cannot be done. Because of the selectivity of transported species, ion concentration is decrease on one side (this is called ‘depletion’), while on the other side ion concentration is increase (this is called ‘enrichment’) as shown in Fig. 6.3. In other words, the permselectivity is the\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 251\nproperty, which let only counter-ions pass through the permselective media so that ion concentration is depleted on one side while it is enriched on the other side. The phenomena of concentration polarization front and back of permselective media is called as ICP [28, 29]. As long as the permselectivity of the nanoporous media is stand up, ICP is always occurred nearby the nanojunction.\nThe permselective systems have a unique feature in the voltage against current curves. As shown in Fig. 6.4a, they have a characteristic shape with a region of slow current variation (the plateau) after a region of linearly increased current against the applied voltage. The linearly increased region is called as ‘Ohmic’ regime and the region of the plateau is called as ‘limiting’ regime. Beyond the limiting regime, the ionic current is grown once again as the applied voltage is increased, this is called as ‘overlimiting’ regime. In the limiting and overlimiting regime, ion depletion zone is extended outward to microchannel reservoir, so that the black region is formed nearby nanoporous membrane shown in Fig. 6.4b. Its extended depletion zone has drawn significant attention in scientific and engineering fields [29–32].\nIn the depletion zone, followings are known as dominant phenomena: (1) ion concentration is depleted below 1/100 dilution against the reservoir concentration [13, 33], (2) the electric field is amplified [34], and (3) strong vortices nearby nanojunction are formed [28]. When the voltage is applied across the cationic permselective nanoporous membrane, cation is permitted to pass through while\n252 H. Lee et al.\nanion is not. As a result, in cathodic side in microchannel, ions are abundant while ions are depleted below 1/100 times in anodic side. Due to the depletion of ionic species as charge carriers, the electrical conductivity becomes extremely small. Because the ionic current through the system should be uniform, the electric field is amplified in depletion zone to satisfy the uniform ionic current which was confirmed by the experimental measurement [34]. Additionally, strong vortices are formed in the depletion zone to satisfy the continuity condition [28]. The vortex speed was estimated to be usually over 1000 lm/s, which is at least (10) times\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 253\nhigher than that of primary electroosmotic flow under the same electric potential. Its speed is proportional to either the square or cube of the applied voltage so that formation of vortex is nonlinear phenomena. At the steady state, Kim et al. [28] clearly observed the counter-rotating vortices adjacent to the nanojunction. In case of single nanojunction, two strong vortices were observed while four independent vortices were formed in the depletion zone of double nanojunctions.\nModels for Ion Concentration Polarization\nClassical model (derived by Levich in 1962 [35]) based on Nernst-Planck equations, which consider ion transport only due to diffusion and electromigration, predicts the linear concentration profile inside the ion depletion zone and Ohmic/ limiting current behavior as a function of applied voltages. In the case of a cation selective membrane, the ionic currents of cation and anion could be expressed as\niþ ¼ DþFzþ dcþdy F2z2þDþ cþ RT dw dy\nð6:49Þ\nand\ni ¼ D Fz dc dy F2z2 D c RT dw dy\nð6:50Þ\nwhere i+ is the ionic current by cation transport, i− is the ionic current by anion transport, D+ is the diffusivity of cation, D− is the diffusivity of anion, F is the Faraday constant, z+ and z− is the valence of each ionic species, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, c+ and c− is the ion concentration of each ionic species, and w is the electric potential, respectively. Equations (6.49) and (6.50) are valid in the domain as shown in Fig. 6.5., where the thickness of ICP layer is b.\nIn order to analyze the Eqs. (6.49) and (6.50), the condition of electroneutrality is assumed to hold within the fluid; that is,\nzþ cþ þ z c ¼ 0 ð6:51Þ\nSecond assumption is the ideally cation selective membrane. Under second assumption, the anion current must be zero because only cation can pass through the membrane. Its mathematical form is\ni jy¼b¼ 0 ð6:52Þ\nWhen there is no anion current source in the fluid, following is hold.\n254 H. Lee et al.\ndi dy ¼ 0 ð6:53Þ\nIntegrating Eq.

In next step, the effective concentration is defined by\nc ¼ cþ vþ ¼ c v\nð6:55Þ\nwhere c is the effective concentration, m+ and m− are the dissociation number. For example of the dissociation number, m+ is 1 and m− is 2 when the electrolyte is CuCl2. With Eqs. (6.51)–(6.55), (6.49) and (6.50) become\niþ ¼ DþFzþ vþ dcdy F2z2þDþ vþ c RT dw dy\nð6:56Þ\nand\n0 ¼ D Fz v dcdy F2z2 D v c RT dw dy\nð6:57Þ\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 255\nFrom the anion current as expressed in Eq. (6.57),\ndw dy ¼ RT Fz c dc dy\nð6:58Þ\nAbove expression means that electric migration is same as diffusive transport when the convective transport is negligible. Using Eq. (6.58), the cation current could be reduced in the following form.\niþ ¼ DþFv zþ z ð Þ dcdy ð6:59Þ\nin which the condition of electroneutrality as expressed in Eq. (6.51) is applied in the following modified form.\nzþ vþ ¼ z v ð6:60Þ\nSince there is a fixed current for a given applied voltage, it follows that c must be linear in distance across the ICP layer. Consider the case of i+ > 0 which corresponds to the formation of the depletion. Due to (z+ – z−) > 0, (dc/dy) should be negative i.e. the concentration of ions decreases from the ICP layer/bulk interface to the membrane surface. The potential drop is also in the same direction. Integrating Eq. (6.59), concentration profile inside the ICP layer is obtained.\nc ¼ c0 iþ yDþFv zþ z ð Þ ð6:61Þ\nwhere c0 is the bulk concentration. When c|y = b = 0, the current density approaches a limiting value which is called as limiting current.\niL ¼ DþFv zþ z ð Þc0b ð6:62Þ\nThe above limiting current was derived by Levich in 1962. Although Levich’s model pointed out that the bulk charge makes impossible the existence of steady currents greater than the limiting values, Rubinstein and Shtilman [33] showed that this is not true. They showed the increase of the ionic current beyond the limiting regime (plateau of Fig. 6.4a). This regime is called as overlimiting regime. To describe the transition from limiting regime to overlimiting one, some mechanisms have been proposed: (1) bulk charge effect [33], (2) surface conduction along the microchannel wall [31], (3) electro-convective mixing inside the ICP layer [31], and (4) electroosmotic instability [36]. With these mechanisms, depletion zone could be extended toward the reservoir so that system could enter the overlimiting regime. In next, a modified model, which considered above mechanisms, are briefly introduced.\n256 H. Lee et al.\nRubinstein and Shtilman [33] developed the model which allows one to investigate the role of the bulk charge in developing concentration polarization and to trace the connection with classical theory. As the simplest possible model consider a steady current passing through an ideally permselective membrane immersed in a stirred solution of 1:1 valent electrolyte. They assumed that near the membrane there is an ‘unstirred’ layer of thickness d, which does not depend on the magnitude of the voltage V, applied to this layer. The concentration of the electrolyte is assumed to be constant and equal to c0. The cation concentration within the membrane is supposed to be equal to the fixed charge concentration N. It is assumed that the ions within the unstirred layer are distributed by means of electro-diffusion only. Direct the x-axis normally to the membrane, identifying x = 0 with the outer boundary of the “unstirred” layer. Then the corresponding boundary value problem takes the form\nd2w dx2 ¼ 4pF e c1 c2ð Þ ð6:63Þ\nd dx dc1 dx þ Fc1 RT dw dx ¼ 0 ð6:64Þ\nd dx dc2 dx Fc2 RT dw dx ¼ 0 ð6:65Þ\nwjx¼0¼ 0 ð6:66Þ\nc1jx¼0¼ c2jx¼0¼ c0 ð6:67Þ\nwjx¼d¼ V ð6:68Þ\nc1jx¼d¼ N ð6:69Þ\ndc2 dx Fc2 RT dw dx\nx¼d\n¼ 0 ð6:70Þ\nwhere e is the dielectric permittivity. The Poisson equation is represented by Eq. (6.63). The Nernst-Planck equations are represented by Eqs. (6.64) and (6.65), which describe the mass transport of charged species under consideration of the diffusion and the electromigration. Because of assumption of unstirred layer, the Stokes equations and the continuity equation for the fluid flow are not solved. Equations from (6.66) to (6.70) are boundary conditions for unstirred ICP layer. Equations (6.66) and (6.67) are the conditions for bulk reservoir. Equations (6.67)– (6.70) are the conditions for the ideally cation selective membrane, so that anion\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 257\nflux through the membrane surface should be zero. Instead of Eq. (6.68), the Donnan equilibrium is often used, which is the following mathematical form.\nwjx¼d ¼ V þ RT F ln N c0\nð6:71Þ\nDue to the Poisson equation, their model could describe the effect of the bulk charge to ICP layer in the overlimiting regime. Their results are showed in Fig. 6.4. In their definition, parameter e is defined by\ne ¼ k 2 D\nd2 ð6:72Þ\nHere the dimensionless parameter has the meaning of a square ratio of the Debye length to the thickness of the unstirred layer. The Levich’s model of concentration polarization, based on the assumption of local electroneutrality corresponds to the limit (Fig. 6.6).\ne ¼ 0 ð6:73Þ\nWith the parameter of Eq. (6.73), ionic current is saturated in the limiting value as denoted in Fig. 6.4a. Due to the effect of the bulk charge, ionic current is increased with different conductance compared with Ohmic regime. In Fig. 6.4b, the plateau of concentration distribution is extended to the bulk interface, in which the plateau is often called as extended space charge layer.\nDydek et al. [31] revisited the classical problem of diffusion-limited ion transport to a membrane by considering the effects of charged sidewalls. Using simple mathematical models and numerical simulations, they identified three additional mechanisms for the overlimiting regime: surface conduction, electro-convective mixing, and electroosmotic instability. In order to consider the effect of the surface conduction only, they assumed that convection becomes negligible compared to diffusion (small Peclet number limit), of which case is corresponding to long, narrow channels and thin double layers. Under their assumption, the Nernst-Planck equations could be homogenized as follows\ndcþ dx þ cþ d ~w dx ¼ j zFD\nð6:74Þ\ndc dx\nc d ~w dx ¼ 0 ð6:75Þ\nc ¼ c ¼ cþ þ qsF ð6:76Þ\n258 H. Lee et al.\nwhere c+ and c− are the mean concentration of cations and anions, respectively, D is the ionic diffusivity, ~w is dimensionless electric potential scaled by the thermal voltage, RT/zF. Equations (6.74) and (6.75) relate the cation flux to the current density j in steady state for an ideally cation selective membrane. Equation (6.76)\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 259\nmeans averaged electroneutrality condition including both ionic and fixed surface charge of microchannel wall and qs is defined as\nqs ¼ 2rs H\nð6:77Þ\nwhere rs is the surface charge density of microchannel wall and H is the depth of the microchannel. Without the loss of generality, they could be derived analytical solutions of Eqs. (6.74) and (6.75). The current-voltage relation is demonstrated to possess nearly constant conductance in the overlimiting regime. Also, the plateau of the concentration profile is formed as similar as the extended space charge layer of Rubinstein and Shtilman [33]. Additionally, they considered the effect of electro-convective mixing. Under and assumption of dead-end channel, pressuredriven back flow opposes electroosmotic flow and results in two counter-rotating vortices. Concentrated solution flows to the membrane along the sidewalls, and depleted solution returns in the center. To describe the electro-convective mixing, they assumed thin double layers and neutral bulk solution described by the steady 2D Nernst-Planck equations, the Stokes equations, and the continuity equation. These governing equations with appropriate boundary conditions were solved numerically. As a result, numerical solutions to describe the electro-convective mixing were obtained.\nThese coupled phenomena resembled the ion transportation through cell membrane since the membrane has various-sized nanopore so that effective control of important ions such as Na+ and K+ are regulated by this basic transport phenomena. In next, we will introduce more intense mechanism called ionic field effect transistor that is capable of controlling the ion transportation through the nanoporous membrane."

Those applications were fundamentally originated from controlling the motion of charged species passing through a nanostructure and, therefore, the cost-effective/on-demand/sensitive control has become the most important practical issue of nanofluidic researches.\nVarious passive types of modulating the motion of a charged species in nanofluidic system were reported such as changing the viscosity of solution in the nanochannel [42], utilizing mechanical friction between DNA and nanopore [43], coating an adhesive material on nanochannel [44] and surface treatment for changing the surface potential [12, 45]. Those platforms employed passive methods which were unable to change the behavior of charged species on-demand, once the devices were fabricated. In contrast, ionic field effect transistor (IFET) can provide an active method which enables to enhance, diminish or even reverse the behavior of charged species in situ by introducing gate potential.\nFigure 6.5a shows a schematic of metal-oxide-electrolyte system which is a key-building unit of ionic field effect transistor. When voltage is applied to the metal part called as gate electrode, surface potential on oxide-electrolyte interface is modulated by field effect so that the electric double layer (EDL) inside the electrolyte solution is changed depending on the applied voltage on the gate electrode. This process is how the IFET control the ionic transport in the nanoscale system. The metal-oxide-electrolyte system is integrated on nanochannel wall, then the nanochannel is connected with microchannel. Figure 6.5b shows the schematic of typical ionic field effect transistor.\nThe first experimental results of an ionic field effect transistor were demonstrated by Gajar and Geis [46] in 1992. The devices had nanochannels about 88 nm in height and 300–900 lm in length. They investigated both the steady-state and transient responses of their ionic FET devices. However, it was found that the response of the IFET to a step voltage in the gate terminal is quite slow. This is mainly due to two reasons. The first is the large geometries of the nanochannel and the second is the existence of processes other than ambipolar diffusion.\nIn 2004, theoretical modeling of the ionic transport in silica nanotubes revived research interest in IFET devices [45]. Fan et al. [47] experimentally demonstrated field effect modulation of ion transport using gated silica nanotubes shown. Using KCl as the testing solution, they found that as the gate voltage varies from −20 to +20 V, the ionic conductance decreases monotonically from 105 pS down to 45 pS, due to depletion of cations under the applied electric field, which shows a typical p-type transistor behavior. Since then, various IFET have been reported. Using multiple nanopore structures with sub-10 nm diameters and TiO2 as dielectric material, Nam et al. [18] also showed that the ionic conductivity of the nanopore can be modulated by a gating voltage. A p-type I–V characteristic was also observed, which suggested the major carriers are cations.\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 261\nAnother application is the control of single molecule translocating through the nanoscale system. Since biomolecules usually have multivalent charges, field effect control over the molecule transport in nanochannels can be more effective than monovalent ions. It has been experimentally observed that the fluorescence intensity of 30-base fluorescently labeled single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in a 1 mM KCl solution could be increased by six times in 2D nanoslits, which is ascribed by the electrostatic interactions between the gating voltage and DNA molecules [48]. It is found that both electroosmotic flow (EOF) and electrostatic interactions arising from the field effect control can effectively regulate the DNA translocation through a nanopore. Recently, Paik et al. [49] demonstrated a gated nanopore structure that is capable of reversibly altering the rate of DNA capture by over three orders of magnitude. They ascribed this extremely large modulation ratio to the counterbalance between the electrophoresis (EP) and the EOF, rather than pure electrostatic interactions between the gating voltage and the DNA molecules. When the gating voltage was low, EOF overwhelmed the EP. Thus DNAs were rejected from entering the pore. In contrast, a high gating voltage reduced the EOF due to the reduced Na+ in the diffuse layer of the nanopore wall so that DNAs were accepted to pass through the nanopore.\nTo reflect these complex features, widely-used models to describe the electrokinetic phenomena inside the IFET will be discussed in the next section.\nConventional Models for Ionic Field Effect Transistor\nIn this section, descriptions of the complete set of equations that were used for simulation of electrokinetic transport in IFET are presented. Most models were formulated under Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes coupled governing equations with appropriate boundary conditions shown in Sect. 6.2.2. Gate effects on ionic transport were interpreted as boundary conditions so that the independent differential equations should be needed. Firstly, general governing equations and boundary conditions are rewritten for the metal-oxide-electrolyte system. Secondly, the gate modulated is described by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and the Laplace equation.\nAs discussed in Sect. 6.2.4, the Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes (PNPS) equations are used to describe the nanoscale electrokinetic system. The electrostatic potential w is governed by the Poisson equation\nr ðerwÞ ¼ qf ð6:78Þ\nwhere meaning of parameter was discussed in Sect. 6.2.1. In Eq. (6.49), the volume charge density is represented by\nqf ¼ F X i zici ð6:79Þ\n262 H. Lee et al.\nci in the above equation is provided by the Nernst-Planck equations, which combines the diffusion due to a concentration gradient, the migration due to an electric field, and convection due to a ambient flow field.\nr Ji ¼ r Dirci ziFDiRT cirwþ ciu ¼ 0 ð6:80Þ\nwithout any chemical reactions. To obtain solutions for flow field, the Stokes equations and the continuity equation should be solved by coupling manner.\n0 ¼ rpþ gr2u qfrw ð6:81Þ\nr u ¼ 0 ð6:82Þ\nWith above governing equations from (6.78) to (6.82), appropriate boundary conditions should be determined. The numerical domain for conventional IFET is shown in Fig. 6.5b. Numerical boundaries were divided into four sections: (1) axis of symmetry, (2) inlet/outlet, (3) reservoirs, and (4) nanochannel wall, as denoted in Fig. 6.5b. Dash-dot line represents axis of symmetry in the cylindrical coordinate system, thus this boundary (denoted as ‘(1)’) possessed symmetry conditions. Corresponding mathematical forms about the axis of symmetry are\nn rw ¼ 0 ð6:83Þ\nn ji ¼ 0 ð6:84Þ\nn u ¼ 0 ð6:85Þ\nIn the above conditions, n is the outward normal vector. On the inlet/outlet boundaries of nanoscale system (denoted as ‘(2)’), electric potential, concentration and pressure were fixed at specific values.\nw ¼ 0 sourceð Þ ð6:86Þ\nw ¼ VDðdrainÞ ð6:87Þ\nci ¼ c0 ð6:88Þ\np ¼ 0 ð6:89Þ\nwhere VD is the applied voltage on drain electrode and c0 is the bulk electrolyte concentration. The third boundary type is reservoirs (denoted as ‘(3)’) on which insulating conditions were satisfied.\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 263\nn rw ¼ 0 ð6:90Þ\nn ji ¼ 0 ð6:91Þ\nn u ¼ 0 ð6:92Þ\nNote that these mathematical forms are equal to conditions of the axis of symmetry, but their physical meanings are different. Most importantly, last boundary type is nanochannel wall (denoted as ‘(4)’) on which surface charge density was set up by normal derivative of electric potential and the walls had no-penetration condition and no-slip condition for the Nernst-Planck equations and the Stokes equations, respectively.\ne n rw ¼ rs ð6:93Þ\nn ji ¼ 0 ð6:94Þ\nu ¼ 0 ð6:95Þ\nwhere rs is the surface charge density on the nanochannel wall. The detailed expressions of boundary conditions were summarized in Table 6.2 once more.\nAs earlier mentioned, IFET could be modeled as metal-oxide-electrolyte (MOE) system. In the usual MOE system, the surface charge density modulated by gate voltage is obtained from simple algebraic equations independent of governing equations. The MOE structure depicted in Fig. 6.7a can be naturally incorporated into chip-based fluidic devices to perform electro-fluidic gating. Its geometry is that of a parallel-plate capacitor as denoted in Fig. 6.8. whose metallic gate electrode is separated from the conductive electrolyte by a thin insulating oxide. The electric double layer is modulated by applying a voltage across the capacitor, which generates an electric field normal to the solid-liquid interface. Here we introduce models for the charging behavior of the MOE capacitor. The electric double layer screens electric fields, whether they originate from the chemical charge at the oxide\n264 H. Lee et al.\nsurface or from the applied voltage across the capacitor. To treat these two contributions separately, we consider an equivalent circuit model of the MOE capacitor, shown in Fig. 6.8. This simple model allows us to determine the potential and the charge density at every location. It consists of three elements arranged in series: two linear capacitors representing the oxide and the Stern layer and a nonlinear element representing the electric double layer. The potential difference across the oxide layer is VG − ws. The oxide is assumed to have a constant capacitance per unit area, Cox, that accurately describes the dielectric properties of common materials used in micro- and nanofluidic devices such as silicon dioxide (SiO2), aluminum dioxide (Al2O3), and poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) [50–52]. The capacitive charge density induced at the surface of the insulator, rox, is given by\nrox ¼ Cox VG wsð Þ ð6:96Þ\nWithin the basic Stern model, the potential drops linearly across the solid-liquid interface by an amount ws − f. The relationship between this potential drop and the charge density screened by the double layer, rDL, is given by\nrDL ¼ CStern ws fð Þ ð6:97Þ\nwhere CStern is the phenomenological Stern capacitance per unit area. CStern reflects the structure and dielectric properties of the solid-liquid interface. The basic Stern model has been widely applied to model the charging of the double layer and is well supported by experimental evidence [53–55]. When the surface reactions between functional groups on the oxide layer and ionic species in the electrolyte solution is considered, the net charge density on the surface of the oxide layer must equal the\n2) 2)\n3) 3)\n3)3)\n4)\n1)\n(a)\n(b)\nchemical charge density from the ionized surface groups charge density from the ionized surface groups, rchem; therefore,\nrchem ¼ rDL rox ð6:98Þ\nHowever, in most cases, the Stern layer and chemistry of the oxide/electrolyte interface are neglected [56, 57] so that rchem is zero, and then remaining surface charge densities become\nrDL ¼ 2ejRTF sinh F 2RT f Vbð Þ\nð6:99Þ\nand\nrox ¼ Cox VG fð Þ ð6:100Þ\nTherefore, gate modulated zeta potential can be determined by Eqs. (6.21)– (6.23) when the Stern layer and the surface reaction are neglected."

Although the conventional theory well-described the microscale system, additional constraints to describe the nanoscale system should be necessary. However, these additional constraints could not be found by only experimental manner because observation inside the nanoscale system was impossible.

This contrast is characterized by the Clausius-Mossotti factor fCM, which is a function of the complex permittivities of both cell and medium. This principle, referred to as conventional dielectrophoresis (cDEP) is commonly used for cell sorting or cell trapping, as will be illustrated with some examples found in the literature. Propagative electric fields are also often used to apply dielectrophoretic forces, which corresponds to travelling wave dielectrophoresis (tw-DEP) in the case of linear propagation, or electrorotation (E ROT), when a rotational electric field is considered. Applications where these two other forms of dielectrophoresis are implemented will also be reported in this chapter. Lastly, examples regarding DEP of biomolecules will be briefly reviewed."

      "text" : "The phenomenon described in this section, arising in the presence of a stationary field, is sometimes referred to as ‘conventional dielectrophoresis’ (cDEP). In electric fields with constant phase, Eq. 6.105 giving the time-averaged force acting on a cell simplifies to:\nFdep ! ¼ 2pemR3cell< fCMð ÞrE2RMS ! ð6:108Þ\nThis equation indicates that the DEP force intensity is cell-volume dependent and that the force cancels if the field is uniform (rE2RMS ! ¼ 0, where ERMS denotes the root-mean-square electric field). The DEP force varies with the square of the applied field magnitude, and its direction is therefore not affected by the field polarity. It is due to the fact that a field reversal results in a reversed induced dipole\nmoment. It also implies that both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) can be used. Dielectrophoresis should therefore not be confused with electrophoresis, which refers to the motion of charged particles in DC electric fields.\nIt can be seen from Eq. 6.108 that the direction of the force depends on the sign of the real part of the fCM factor. The case where < fCMð Þ[ 0 corresponds to the cell being more polarisable than its surrounding medium, resulting in an induced dipole moment aligned with the applied field. As a consequence, the cell is translated towards regions of highest electric field magnitude under the effect of positive DEP (pDEP, see Fig. 6.10a). Conversely, the case where < fCMð Þ\\0 corresponds to the cell being less polarisable than its immersion medium, resulting in an induced dipole moment directed against the applied field. The cell is then directed towards areas of low electric field strength, which is referred to as negative DEP (nDEP, see Fig. 6.10b).\nFor a spherical particle, the real part of the fCM factor is comprised between −0.5 and 1. This term therefore not only determines the direction of the force, but it also affects its intensity. As can be seen from Fig. 6.11, the dielectrophoretic behaviour of a cell can be adjusted by tuning the field frequency. It should be noted that the conductivity and permittivity of the cell themselves vary with the frequency, due to the heterogeneous structure of biological particles (Fig. 6.12). In the low frequency range (below a few tens of kHz), the DEP force depends on the respective conductivities of the cell and its immersion medium. The cell membrane blocks current\n270 H. Lee et al.\nflow, which leads to the cell being less polarizable than the medium (i.e. nDEP force). With increasing frequency, the high membrane resistance is progressively bypassed by the membrane capacitance, and the magnitude and direction of the force depend on the interplay between the dielectric properties of the membrane and cytoplasm. At frequencies higher than a few tens of MHz, the DEP response is dominated by the respective permittivities of cell interior and surrounding medium.\nAs can be seen on Fig. 6.11. There are two frequencies at which the direction of the DEP force exerted on the cell reverses, commonly referred to as “crossover frequencies”.\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 271\nThe lower crossover frequency value, corresponding to a transition from nDEP to pDEP, can be shifted by modifying the surrounding medium conductivity. Hence this parameter plays an important role on the cell dielectrophoretic behaviour. Low conductive media (rm being a few tens of mS m−1) are currently used in DEP experiments because in more conductive physiological media (rm 1 S m 1) observation of pDEP is only possible at very high frequencies and Joule heating effects can become a concern. The low conductivity buffer used must be formulated to maintain pH and osmolarity within the physiological range.\nAs previously mentioned, the force intensity is directly proportional to the gradient of the squared electric field strength. If the electrode gap is scaled down by a factor K, the DEP force gets scaled up by a factor of K3. Hence significant forces can be generated by applying a few volts to miniaturized electrodes. The electric field distribution is determined by the choice of the electrode geometry. The spatial non-uniformities required for the DEP effect is commonly generated by 2D co-planar electrodes of interdigitated, castellated or polynomial design [61]. Yet, a variety of alternative electrode structures have also been developed to allow exploitation of interesting 3D effects, such as “top-bottom” electrodes [62] or sidewall conducting PDMS electrodes in microfluidic devices [63, 64]. Insulating structures in a microchannel with remote electrodes can also be exploited to shape the electric field [65], following the principle of IDEP (insulator-based dielectrophoresis). Demierre et al. proposed the concept of “liquid electrodes” combining planar electrodes with IDEP technique [66]. This configuration exploits metal electrodes fabricated on the bottom of dead-end chambers placed on the side of a microfluidic channel and acting similarly to thick electrodes embedded in the channel walls. Detailed reviews of microfabrication technologies and microelectrode geometries employed in DEP applications can be found in the literature [67, 68].\nDielectrophoresis is a technique currently employed for cell handling in microfluidic systems. As a contactless and label-free manipulation method, it provides a non invasive tool to perform various tasks such as sample preparation (concentration, filtering, enrichment), cell sorting or cell isolation prior to further detection or measure of response to various stimuli. DEP has been used for instance in immunosensors to enhance the capture and detection of pathogenic bacteria by bringing the cells to the sensor site while increasing the contact between the target and the immobilized antibodies, prior to sandwich ELISA detection of captured cells [69]. Hamada and coworkers proposed similarly to detect bacteria by first capturing cells onto microelectrodes using pDEP and then measuring the variation of electrode impedance due to the presence of trapped bacteria [70].\nDEP traps were also designed to perform parallel single-cell assays. Monitoring of many individual cells at the same time involves their patterning in array format, which can be achieved using quadrupole electrode units [71–73]. This electrode arrangement offers the advantage of providing strong confinement under nDEP, as cells less polarizable than the surrounding suspending medium will be directed away from electrode edges towards the center of the interelectrode gap [61]. Silicon Biosystems has developed and brought to market a chip called DEPArrayTM for\n272 H. Lee et al.\nmassively parallel handling of cells with single cell resolution. Programmable electrodes are used to generate DEP “cages” within which single cells may be trapped, levitated and manipulated individually. A DEP cage corresponds to a field minimum created above a microelectrode by applying a sinusoidal voltage to the associated electrode and to the conductive Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) lid, and a counterphase sinusoidal voltage to the surrounding electrodes. The dynamic traps can be reconfigured dynamically under software control, so as to move the cells above the device plane towards the desired target location.\nDEP-driven cell assembly also constitutes a promising route to engineer biomaterials that mimic the structure of native tissues and develop cell-culture platforms reproducing in vivo cellular microenvironment. Ho et al. have demonstrated rapid heterogeneous patterning of liver cells using concentric radiating tip electrode array. The obtained alternate radial pattern of hepatocytes and endothelial cells mimicked the lobular morphology of real liver tissue [74]. Such bottom-up approach may provide better control over the relative spatial organization of cells compared to more traditional top-down approaches based on scaffolds. It also offers the advantage to promote cell-cell interactions. Menad et al. have recently shown that cell aggregates of regular size and shape could be fabricated using nDEP. Those cell assemblies could be maintained by cell-cell adhesion after the electric field removal and indications of cell activity into aggregates were observed after overnight incubation [75]. This may offer a new approach to produce 3D tumor spheroid models for in vitro therapeutic screening.\nOne of the main applications of dielectrophoresis is the selective capture of target cells from a mixed population, which can be achieved without the need for labeling. Since dielectric properties of cells are dependent upon various parameters including morphological factors such as cell volume and membrane area, different cell types will exhibit different crossover frequencies in a given medium.\nThe simplest separation approach consists in dividing a cell mixture into two distinct sub-populations, by choosing an operating frequency at which one fraction of cells is submitted to nDEP and the other one to pDEP. Physical separation of the two sub-populations is then achieved by superimposing a liquid flow above the electrode array. Based on this principle, Becker et al. have shown that human breast cancer cells could be separated from blood using the castellated electrode design described on Fig. 6.13a [76].\nDoh and Cho presented a continuous cell separation chip using three planar electrodes placed at the bottom of a microfluidic channel. Cells with pDEP affinity moved towards the chamber walls while cells with nDEP affinity remained in the central streamline. The laminar nature of the flow enabled the collection of cell fractions through different outlets [77]. Bisceglia et al. developed a method and a microfluidic device for the extraction and concentration of pathogens from a suspension of blood cells, based on the large tolerance of micro-organisms towards osmotic shocks. A hypotonic medium selectively alters blood cells and changes their dielectric properties while keeping most micro-organisms functional. Following this approach, micro-organisms were trapped using pDEP, while altered\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 273\nblood cells submitted to negative dielectrophoresis were driven by the flow towards the device outlet [78].\nCell separation can also be achieved using dielectrophoresis field flow fractionation (DEP-FFF), a chromatographic approach in which cells are positioned at different heights within the separation chamber using a combination of dielectrophoretic and sedimentation forces. Due to the parabolic flow profile, different cell subpopulations travel at different velocities according to their distance from the chamber floor and therefore emerge from the outlet at different times (Fig. 6.13b). Provided the chamber length is long enough, this method allows to fractionate cells with subtle differences. It also enables to discriminate more than two cell classes. A continuous flow microfluidic processing chamber was recently proposed by Gascoyne and coworkers to achieve a throughput as high as 106 cells ∙ min−1 and isolate circulating tumor cells from 10 mL clinical blood specimens in less than 1 h [79]. The ApoStream® technology developed by ApoCell Inc is based on this approach.\n274 H. Lee et al."

The resulting translational force propels the particle along the electrodes, with or against the field direction, depending on whether the imaginary component of the Clausius Mossoti factor is negative or positive, respectively.

Lee et al.\nFor the trapping step, the four electrodes are powered with opposite phase sine waves (angular frequency x1, amplitude V̂ , see Fig. 6.15). The resulting force field pushes the cell towards the center of the electrode set due to nDEP.\nThe cell also experiences a levitation force, that cannot be described by the Eq. 6.105 as the electric field is null for any altitude along the line at the center of the electrode set. Indeed Eq. 6.105 remains true as long as the electric field is homogenous all over the volume of the handled dielectric particle, that can be considered in that case as a dipole. In the case where the cell is centered by the four-electrode set, it experiences higher moments of the force [83, 84] and it is finally pushed not only where the electric field is minimal but also where its gradient is minimal (if the second order is considered).

Such a 3D device structure is more complicated to fabricate than the simple coplanar device, but ensures an easier control of the cell altitude, getting rid of any friction between the cell and the device ceiling or floor (see Fig. 6.16)."

However, while the DEP behavior of cells is well understood, the polarization mechanism of biomolecules is not fully elucidated. In the case of DNA, the underlying mechanism inducing DEP motion is mainly attributed to counterion response to AC electric fields. Negatively charged phosphate groups along the DNA backbone attract positive counterions from the surrounding ionic solution, which migrate in response to the applied field (Fig. 6.17).\nThe resulting shift in the counterion cloud results in an induced dipole moment which is assumed to be responsible for DNA DEP behavior [92]. Washizu and coworkers pioneered the concept of DNA DEP more than twenty years ago by demonstrating the stretching of DNA molecules under a field strength of 106 V/m and a frequency of 1 MHz. The size (number of base pairs) of the stretched DNA molecule could thereby be determined and target DNA fragments could be cut using a UV beam [93]. This group also demonstrated that synthesized oligonucleotides having 22 bases could be separated from k-DNA (having 48.5 kbp) using DEP-FFF. The larger molecules showed higher polarisation and were retained onto the electrodes placed at the bottom of the separation chamber, while the smaller oligonucleotides could flow more easily through the channel [94]. Tuukkanen et al. also demonstrated trapping of DNA molecules as small as 27 base pairs, which shows that DNA manipulation can be achieved over a broad range of sizes [95]. It should be noted that real-time observation of DNA motion is typically achieved using fluorescence microscopy and therefore requires DNA staining.\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 279\nDEP is also an interesting tool for protein concentration, which is often a prerequisite in bioanalytical applications, since proteins, unlike DNA, cannot be amplified. Most proteins are around 1–10 nm in size. Given the fast decay of FDEP with the cube of the particle radius and the influence of Brownian motion on small objects, large electric field gradients are therefore required to enable their manipulation (rE2 as high as 1015–1016 V2∙ m−3). The different devices reported for protein DEP were recently reviewed by Nakano and Ros [96]. Clarke et al. increased the concentration of immunoglobulin G proteins by a factor of 300 at the tip of a capillary glass of inner diameter 100–150 nm using electrodeless dielectrophoresis. An electric field of 106 V m 1 was generated in the tip of the nanopipette on application of a 1 voltage between the electrodes in the pipette (ground electrode) and bath solution (working electrode). The tip acts as a constriction used to create a high-field gradient with a local maximum, allowing protein trapping by pDEP [97]. While this study was aimed at concentrating proteins in the bulk, it is also possible to immobilize proteins on surface using DEP without the need for any chemical modification. Otto et al. have achieved dielectrophoretic immobilisation of antibodies on a regular array of cylindrical sub-microelectrodes and could demonstrate that the antibodies capability to bind to target proteins was preserved after DEP application [98].\n280 H.

While these phenomena may induce perturbations in some cases, they can also be exploited in conjonction with DEP to provide a large panel of manipulation approaches [103, 104]."

      "text" : "Due to their structure and composition, organic materials have free and bound electrically charged entities. When excited by an external electromagnetic field, drifts and displacements of those charges are provoked, inducing conduction and polarization currents within the material. The dielectric properties of the material are a measure of these induced microscopic conduction and polarization phenomena, which constitute the response of the material to an external electromagnetic field.\nSince the dielectric properties are determined by and informative about the nature, the composition and the state of the organic material, they are considered as valuable characterization parameters in many scientific and engineering fields involving organic material, such as agriculture, food industry [105–107] and healthcare [108]. In agrifood engineering, the dielectric properties are used e.g. to monitor the quality of food products [107, 109, 110], or to evaluate their state of integrity during maturation [111] or storage [112, 113]. They are also used to predict and control the effects of electro-thermal treatments such as sterilization or pasteurization on food products [105, 114, 115]. In the healthcare domain, the dielectric properties provide relevant information about the physiological state of biological cells and tissues. They are a way of monitoring the state and changes occurring in biological material, which can for example lead to the elaboration of medical diagnosis of tissue pathologies such as inflammation, burns, tumors, etc. [116–122]. Indeed, natural evolutions of organic material such as maturation or ageing, material modifications due to processing such as heating, freezing, or thawing…, or cell functional and/or morphological alterations appearing e.g. with pathologies, result in either structural alterations or changes in the complex biochemical content of the material. In all cases, these alterations induce significant\n282 H. Lee et al.\nmodifications of the dielectric properties of the material. For example, cell membranes altered by electroporation feature modified dielectric properties, which can be read out through the measurement of the changes of the global cell bio-impedance in a 20 MHz frequency range [123]; in the same way, the dielectric properties of tissues with tumors are reported as exhibiting more than 70% changes relatively to those of sound tissues at around 100 MHz [124].\nAs a result, the dielectric properties constitute relevant indicators either for the monitoring of organic material changes, or for the detection, the characterization and the monitoring of pathologies. Due to the complex structure of organic material which includes macromolecules of various sizes and shapes, the dielectric properties are strongly frequency dependant. For these reasons, a wide range of dielectric characterization methods have been developed, involving electromagnetic fields operating especially in the radiofrequency (RF) and microwave (MW) bandwidths, i.e. including frequencies ranging from a few kHz to tens of GHz. This chapter aims at presenting the basics of the interactions taking place between electromagnetic fields and organic material, and at presenting typical dielectric sensing and characterization devices developed for various scales of organic material investigations. The chapter is organized as follows. Firstly, basics on the dielectric properties of organic material will be recalled, with emphasis on biomaterial such as cells and tissues. Secondly, examples of dielectric characterization methods and devices used for healthcare applications and operating from cell up to tissue scales will be presented."

They are constituted of complex liquids including organic and mineral elements, macromolecules, water-insoluble matter such as fibers or tendons. The organization of these constitutive elements allows intra and extra cellular structures to be formed. At meso or macroscopic scales these structures appear to be homogeneous, and feature highly variable structural properties which, on a mechanical standpoint, range from liquid to solid state materials [125].\nAt a tissue scale, these structures can be considered as mainly immerged in an aqueous liquid. The resulting complex fluids include organic electrolytes and bio-molecules which interact with one another, and feature properties close to those of aqueous solutions, due to their molecular asymmetry, their electrically polarized nature and their hydrogen and molecular bonding. The particular arrangement and biochemical composition of each tissue provide specific functionalities,\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 283\nthe biological and physical roles of which are fundamental within the whole biological system. Biological tissues may fall into two main families: (i) the connective tissues, which are constituted of entangled cells included in a kind of matrix featuring various stiffness properties, ranging from fluid like material (e.g. blood), to gel like material (e.g. adipose tissue) and solid state materials (e.g. bones); and (ii) the epithelial tissues featuring joined cells, such as skin.\nAt a microscopic scale, cells strongly contribute to the macroscopic evolution of the biological system. To do so, they possess specific functionalities, such as autoreplication, environmental protection, acquisition of nutritive elements, communication, degradation and renewing of intrinsic molecules, production of energy, etc. Despite their small size (1–100 µm), cells generally contains numerous components and feature structural properties of complex fluids [126].\nThe inner part of the cell includes a nucleus, a cytoskeleton made of a network of microtubules, some intermediary filaments, organelles of different size and shapes, proteins, all immerged in an intracellular solution (cytosol). The cell is covered by a phospholipid double layer membrane reinforced by proteins molecules. These proteins are formed with specific three dimensional structured polymers including hydrophobic sites, which depend on the affinity of hydrophilic polar groups present in the solution surrounding the cell. They are accompanied by large mounds of organic material. In aqueous solutions, these macromolecules behave like electrically polarized molecules featuring permanent or induced bipolar electrical moments of various magnitudes, depending on the size and shape of the molecules. Carbohydrates are also present at the surface of membranes, which are involved in cell communications, and also responsible for the secretion of lubricating gels in\n284 H. Lee et al.\nsome tissues such as cartilage, tendons or ligaments. In aqueous solutions they modify the dispersion of water according to their concentration.\nFinally, a large amount of electrolytes such as sodium, calcium, magnesium and chlorides play important roles in cell functioning and biological interactions. Numerous vital processes depend on the equilibrium between inner and outer cell electrolytes concentrations. The cellular membrane are globally impermeable to passive ions exchanges, but allow physiologically controlled unidirectional or bidirectional going through of ions. At that scale of operation, a loss of that subtle equilibrium e.g. due to a microbial infection may result in a chain reaction with possible severe consequences such as irreversible structural changes in the tissue. Such biological dysfunctions should be detected and characterized at an early stage so that an appropriate therapy can be proposed.\nThe involved nano/micro-scale biochemical content and structural changes result in the changes of the dielectric properties of the organic material, which may be observed at larger (micro to meso) scales of observations, providing appropriate dielectric sensing device can be developed."

These effects are macroscopically described by the complex permittivity e of the biological material (considered as homogeneous and generally isotropic) and which reads [127, 128]:\ne ¼ e0 j e00 ¼ e0er j rx ð6:114Þ\nIn this complex expression, j ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffi 1p and x is the angular frequency. The real part eʹ = e0er accounts for the permittivity of the material (where e0 is the permittivity of vacuum and er is the dielectric constant of the material, also designated as the relative permittivity). The permittivity measures the induced polarization of the material by units of electrical field, i.e. the extent to which the bound charge distributions can be distorted and polarized under the influence of the field, and the consequent energy stored within the material. For organic material, these charge distributions are mainly associated with double layer membrane proteins, with the surface of solvated macromolecules or with other polar molecules [129].\nThe imaginary part e00 of the complex permittivity e is relative to the dielectric losses associated with the displacement and conduction currents induced within the material by the applied field. In biological material, conduction currents are mainly due to the ionic free charges moving through the tissue under the influence of the field. These losses are proportional to the effective conductivity r (Eq. 6.115) the material, expressed in S/m.\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 285\nEach electrically active entity within the material structure will exhibit its own characteristic response to the applied field, according to its own nature, shape and size. As a result, the macroscopic terms e0 and e00 (or er and r) exhibit a frequency dependant behavior. Besides, the proportion of the dielectric losses to the stored energy is given by the loss tangent so that:\ntan d ¼ e 00\ne0 ¼ r e0erx ð6:115Þ\nIn order to sense structural modifications of biological material through their macroscopic dielectric properties changes, it is relevant to chose the frequency of investigation at which the changes of e0 and e00 are both significant, i.e. in the same order of magnitude.

      "text" : "Because of the complexity of the organic material structure, dielectric properties changes due to material alterations may occur at various scales. The difficulty for developing devices able to sense these alterations lies in the choice of the most relevant investigation frequency, since several relaxation times may be distinguished for biological tissues. Indeed, due to multiple interactions occurring at multiple scales, four relaxation times are experimentally observed in the 1 Hz– 100 GHz [130–133]. They are modeled by means of the Cole-Cole-Davidson weighed complex sum form [131, 132, 134]:\n286 H. Lee et al.\ne ¼ e1 j rsx þ X n\nDen\n1þ j xxn 1 an ð6:119Þ\nwhere Den is the permittivity change (Den ¼ en e1), en is the static permittivity for relaxation n, an is the a frequency dispersion coefficient relative to relaxation n. This model can be adjusted to fit with experimental data and is generally limited to a 3-pole simplified model in a 3 decade frequency bandwidth [30, 32, 33]. It may also be relevant to consider the imaginary and real parts dependancy so that the permittivity frequency response writes [135, 136]:\ne ¼ e1 j rsx þ De\nj xxn a þ j xxn 1 b c ð6:120Þ\nwhere a, b, c are real coefficients taking values in the [0, 1] range. The adjustment of these coefficients allows models rather close to observed dispersion data to be elaborated in a large frequency bandwidth.\nIn order to sense material structural alterations, it is necessary to determine the relevant frequency range. Published experimental studies on biological tissues point out that a main relaxation time arises around a few tens of MHz for typical tissues, depending on the actual aqueous content of the tissue [137, 138] (Fig. 6.20).\nHigh water content biological tissue exhibit three main dispersion areas commonly called a, b and c dispersions, as depicted in Fig. 6.20. In the low frequencies (below 10 kHz), the a-dispersion is characterized by a rather large dispersion on the relative permittivity, which may be partly attributed to the diffusion of electrolytes. Other complexes mechanisms have also been reported in the literature [139]. Several interactions occurring next to the cell membrane surfaces are also involved,\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 287\nsuch as hydrophilic—hydrophobic interactions in the protein double layer membrane, ionic canals, etc. Due to the size and shape of the involved macromolecules structures, several dispersions might be superimposed. The ionic equilibrium between extra and intra cellular media which are separated from around 6 nm, can also significantly modify the dispersion in that area.\nThe b-dispersion, is considered as extending along a 4 decade frequency bandwidth typically centered around 10 MHz (Fig. 6.20). It is due for one part to the polarization of various macromolecules within the intra cellular media, but mainly to the interfacial polarization of the cell membranes. The latter acts as a barrier for passive ion transport, the efficiency of which depending on the frequency of the applied electrical field. These interfacial polarization phenomena have been theoretically and experimentally studied [141]. Some simplified models build with double layered spherical systems included in ionic liquids foresee the presence of a number of dispersion directly related to the number of interfaces [142, 143]. Besides, it was experimentally established that damaged cell membranes modify the b-dispersion. Hence, numerous biomedical applications are based on the monitoring of the b-dispersion which is related to physio-pathological state changes of biological material, induced by cell morphology or cell physiology modifications. Finally, the c dispersion is related to the polarization of water molecules and therefore occurs in a higher frequency range (>1 GHz). The detection of pathologies involving water content modifications such as enhanced vascularization due to the presence of tumors can be detected through the monitoring of the c-dispersion of the dielectric properties of tissues."

To that respect, the use of electromagnetic waves corresponding to the b-dispersion, seems particularly relevant to monitor tissue changes (i) due to cell structural modifications in dense areas through the changes of the polarizability of the material, or (ii) to the modifications of dissolved ionic components in soft material through the modification of the conductivity. Higher frequencies of investigation should help to downsize the scale of investigation, so that higher order dispersions and refined cell model could be considered.\nFor that reason, numerous dielectric characterization techniques have been developed in a wide frequency bandwidth ranging from a few kHz up to tens of GHz.

      "text" : "The electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a measurement technique allowing the bio-impedance of organic material to be sensed over a frequency bandwidth which, in practice, generally operates from a few kHz up to 100 MHz. The basic principle of the measurement is to inject a small frequency-adjustable alternating current within the material, and to measure the voltage drop appearing between two (or more) electrodes, which are either deposited on or inserted within the material.\nThe bio-impedance of the material is determined using ohm’s law, and gives information which is related to the local dielectric properties of the investigated material. This technique is widely used and is proven efficient in various medical applications such as tissue pathology diagnostic or monitoring, e.g. for cell [123], tumor [145] or wound healing [146] characterizations. In its simplest form, EIS can be implemented using a two-electrode scheme, as presented in Fig. 6.21a. Two electrodes are placed in contact with the material and connected to the impedance\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 289\nmeasurement device. The electrical equivalent circuit is presented in Fig. 6.21b, in which Zbio is the bio-impedance to be measured, Zi are interface impedances, Zin is the measurement device input impedance, supposed to be “infinitely high”, so that:\nv i ¼ 2Zi þ Zbio ð6:121Þ\nThe injected current i being known, the voltage drop v being measured, it is possible to estimate Zbio providing Zi is small enough or previously determined using a calibration procedure. A highly demonstrative experiment aiming at illustrating the relevance of the EIS to characterize organic material was proposed in [147] as a experimental training for undergraduate students. The experiment is based on set up presented in Fig. 6.21a. It consists in inserting a pair of pin electrodes into a potato used as an easy to handle biomaterial, and in measuring the resulting bio-impedance at the end of the electrode pair in the 100 Hz–20 MHz bandwidth. In this frequency range, it is mostly the ionic conduction that affects the bio-impedance. Here, Zi is considered as negligible and a v/i Bode plot enables Zbio to be visualized over the whole frequency range. The observed electrical phenomenon can be modeled as depicted in Fig. 6.22: an elementary equivalent circuit is established which includes (i) a resistance Rext, accounting for the electrical conductivity of the extracellular matter, (ii) a resistance Rin accounting for the intracellular conductivity and (iii) a capacitor Cext modeling the cell membrane ion-barrier.\nThis model is quite coarse, however it gives a rather good image of the macroscopic electrical behavior of tissues, e.g. for human skin [148]. It can be refined introducing a so-called constant phase element which is a fractional power capacitor modeling the discrepancies between cells within the tissue [149]. The resulting bio-impedance electrical model then reads:\n290 H. Lee et al.\nwhere R− is the high frequency resistance, R0 is the static resistance, is the relaxation time, and a is a parameter taking values in the [0 1] interval.\nHere, the electrical circuit model of Fig. 6.22b. provides an acceptable model that fits with the measured potato EIS data. In the low frequencies (f < 10 kHz), Zbio= Rext since ionic current lines are limited to the extracellular matter (Cext acts as an open circuit). For high frequencies (f > 10 MHz) Zbio = Rext // Rin since ionic current flows through both the extra and intra cellular matter (Cext acts as a short circuit). In this frequency range, the resistance of the material is reduced (Rin Rext) which corresponds to an increased conductivity. For midrange frequencies (around 200 kHz), a transient electrical behaviour is observed. It corresponds to a b-type dispersion in which the cell membrane barrier progressively opens to the ion flow, and in which consequently the conductivity increases (as presented in Fig. 6.20. In order to put into light the change of the material electrical properties with the alteration of the biomaterial, Français et al. propose to provoke an electroporation of the cell membrane [147] and to measure the resulting bio-impedance changes. The electroporation consists in applying electrical field pulse sequence to the organic material (e.g. a sequence of 10 rectangular pulses of 100 µs duration separated from 1 s, and featuring a 500 V/cm intensity between the electrodes), so as to actively induce the formation of pores within the cell membranes. After electroporation, the measured EIS data are significantly changed and may be modeled by new electrical element values. In particular, the Rext value is reduced by a 20–30% rate, resulting from the increase of the ionic conductivity of the material resulting from the provoked poration of the cell membranes. Based on the approach, the EIS difference between electropored and untreated tissues (lung, heart, …) of small animals was successfully highlighted in a 10 MHz bandwidth, showing 50– 80% magnitude changes at 200 kHz [150]. Also, normal and malignant mice breast tissues were successfully diagnosed using EIS in a 100 Hz–1 MHz bandwidth [151].\nThe two-electrode measurement scheme might be found inaccurate when the interface impedances Zi cannot be ignored or previously measured. To that end, a four-electrode scheme depicted in Fig. 6.21b. can be preferred. In this scheme, the bio-impedance Zbio is directly given by the ratio v/i, whatever the values of Zi, providing the measurement device feature an high input impedance Zin and providing appropriate placement of the four electrode set (Fig. 6.22). Lukaski et al. evaluated the efficiency of the four-electrode bio-impedance measurement to non-invasively and reliably monitor the healing of cutaneous wounds [146]. Surface electrodes were placed at each side of a wound (19 mm in length, 17 mm in width, and 2 mm in depth) as depicted in (Fig. 6.23) and the monitoring of the real part (R), the imaginary part (Xc) and the phase angle (PA) of the bio-impedance was carried out over the healing period (tens of days) at a 50 kHz frequency. In this work, the real part R was found to be inversely proportional to the amount of extracellular fluid and directly proportional to the fibrin clot and epithelialization, thus correlated to the successful wound healing. Similarly, Xc was found to be proportional to the cell mass, through the polarizability of the cell membrane. As a result, increases in Xc indicate epidermal proliferation whereas Xc decreases with\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 291\ninfection and cell loss. Healthy membranes cause a delay in the transit of voltage and current; thus, the greater the PA, the healthier the cell membranes, and decreases in PA reflect impaired membrane function. For uncomplicated wound healing, the observed general pattern is a continuous increase in R, Xc, and PA that is consistent with decreased extracellular fluid, increased cell mass, vitality and epithelialization.\nThe EIS approach can be extended to electrodes arrays, in order to provide spatially resolved bio-impedance characterizations. To this end, a two dimensional (2D) bio-impedance measurement device was proposed in [145] to locate and characterize pathological epithelial tissues in a 0.1 Hz–100 kHz bandwidth. The device uses 64 units of four electrode sets (256 electrodes), providing a 2D bio-impedance image of the investigated tissue with a 400 µm 400 µm resolution. The device was successfully implemented on a pig tissues (skin, tong) to detect and characterize wound extends. Based on this approach, 2D or even 3D EIS imaging techniques were developed for breast tumor detection [119]. Even if contact issues, resolution issues, and electrode distribution issues were observed, preliminary clinical examinations showed promising results fully or partially consistent with X-ray mammography and biopsy [152]. More recently, a flexible micro-electrode array has been proposed in [153] for the early detection of pressure ulcers in vivo. The array is fabricated by means of an inkjet printed technology and features a hexagonal configuration of 55 equally spaced ( 2 mm apart) gold electrodes printed on a 35 µm polyethylene naphthalate flexible substrate, and electrically connected to the tissue via highly conductive hydrogel bumps printed above the electrodes. The array is placed on a wound in vivo and the electrical impedance is collected in a 100 Hz–1 MHz bandwidth for each pair of neighboring electrodes. Maps of impedance magnitude, phase angle and post-processed damage threshold are constructed based on the location of each electrode measurement pair. The array enables the non-invasive assessment of pressure induced tissue damage on a rat model, with sufficient sensitivity and robustness to carry out the early detection of mild and reversible wounds that are not visually observable. Even if actual clinical test have to be performed, this device arise promising applications to prevent irreversible tissue damage. The examples presented above illustrate macroscopic implementations of EIS, which give macroscopic electrical information related to microscopic phenomenon. A reduced scale of investigation may be obtained using lab on chips in a microfluidic environment, where cell EIS might be carried out.\nFor example, Fernandez et al. [154] proposed a flexible label free sensor aiming at assessing the viability and biomass of cells, through the measurement of their bio-impedance. To do so, yeast cells are grown, collected and suspended in a dionized water solution. The cell suspension flows within microfluidic channels equipped with parallel electrodes placed at each side of the channel. The electrical impedance viewed from the electrodes is modeled with an electrical circuit constituted of electrode stray resistances and capacitances, of the resistance of the extracellular solution flowing in the channel, of the intracellular cytoplasmic resistance Rcyt and of the cell membrane capacitance (Cm). In order to solely sense Rcyt and Cm that are related to the cell dielectric properties, a differential microfluidic device featuring two channels equipped with electrode pairs separated by different distances is build up. The differential structure of the device enables to determine the permittivity of the cell from the evaluation of Rcyt and Cm, using a Cole-Cole model of the cell permittivity in a 0.3–50 MHz bandwidth. Experimental results show that viable cells exhibit an electric impedance spectrum which is different in amplitude and in relaxation time from heat treated cells, which are altered in their shape and electrical parameters (Rcyt and Cm) due to membrane degradation. In the same way, Bürgel et al. [123] proposed an on-chip single cell microfluidic integrated device allowing for the electroporation and the EIS of single cells in suspension (Fig. 6.24). Paired electrodes are used to induce the cell electroporation and to carry out the EIS analysis. Here, the electroporation is achieved by exposing the cell to an electric field of 2 kV/cm at 50 kHz in a single passage. The passage of single cells is detected and impedance measurements are performed at 8 frequencies distributed in the 20 kHz–20 MHz range, constituting the EIS. After baseline removal (subtraction of the EIS of cell-free solutions) and electrical modeling of the channel/cell impedances, the effect and dynamics of the electroporation of HeLa cells were clearly demonstrated through on-chip EIS analysis.\nFor practical reasons, EIS techniques are generally limited to a 100 MHz bandwidth above which the simple electrical equivalent R-C modeling of the sensing system no longer applies [155]. However higher investigation frequencies may be necessary to reach more thorough characterizations involving higher\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 293\nfrequency dispersions or reduced investigation scales, so that refined material models such as layered tissues, multi-shell cell models, etc. can be elaborated. To do so, waveguide based dielectric sensing devices must be considered."

      "text" : "Designing high frequency sensing devices requires the use of waveguide based sensors. Indeed, high frequency excitation signals generate electromagnetic wavelengths that might reduce down to the same dimensional sizes as the device, so that quasi static assumptions no longer apply. The design of waveguides based sensing devices enables electromagnetic wave propagations to be controlled, so that appropriate sensor model might be developed. Numerous waveguides based techniques have been developed for dielectric characterizations since the 1940s [156]. They fall into two main categories: the transmission measurement techniques, and the reflectometric measurement techniques.\nIn transmission measurement methods, a two-port waveguide is implemented (Fig. 6.25). The incident wave is injected in port-1 and transmitted to port-2. The organic sample is inserted in or placed next to the waveguide, so that the transmitted electromagnetic wave is altered by the dielectric properties of the sample. A vector network analyzer (VNA) is used to determine the complex transmission coefficient S21 defined by the ratio between the transmitted wave (measured in the port-1 reference plane) and the incident wave (measured in the port-2 reference plane). In the same way, the reflectometric measurement method uses a waveguide device including or placed next to the sample under test (Fig. 6.25). The characterization of the sample consists in determining the complex reflection coefficient S11 defined as the ratio between the reflected and injected waves in the port-1\n294 H. Lee et al.\nreference plane, by means of a VNA. Reflectrometric methods based on the use of coaxial probes are the most popular techniques and have been widely used for the dielectric characterization of organic material, thanks to their easy and non-invasive implementation features. Coaxial probes are generally made of a open-ended coaxial transmission line, possibly terminated by a dielectric bead, and set directly in contact with the considered material, enabling ex vivo as well as in vivo characterizations. The accuracy of the method requires (i) a good contact between the probe and the material, which is generally reached with organic materials in the form of liquids, gels or malleable solids, and (ii) some calibration process using reference liquids [156] such as di-ionized water, ethanol, and methanol solutions [157].\nGabriel et al. [158] elaborated a database of the dielectric properties of a wide range of excised animal tissue in a 20−37 °C temperature range, and over a 20 GHz bandwidth by means of coaxial probes, and a four dispersion Cole-Cole model associated to a static ionic conductivity term (Eq. 6.6) have been used to reduce the complexity of various human and animal tissues (brain, fat, breast, skin, bone, liver, etc.) [138]. A 3 mm diameter precision open-ended coaxial probe was used in [120] to assess the in vivo complex permittivity of normal and malignant human liver tissues, converting the measured reflexion coefficient into the tissue complex permittivity using the de-embedding and rational function models described in [157]. In the context of the enhancement of controlled electrical intra-cardiac chirurgical operations, Brusson et al. [118] used a precision coaxial probe in the 0.8–2.6 GHz range to correlate the depth of electrically induced heart tissue burns (and quantified by microscopic observations) with the measured complex reflection of the implemented probe, in the 0–6 mm depth range. Caduff et al. proposed a waveguide based multisensory approach to carry out non invasive glucose monitoring [159]. Indeed, it has been established that blood glucose variations induce changes in the skin and underlying tissues (SAUT) dielectric properties. In order to sense these changes, a set dielectric sensors were designed to investigate the SAUT in the 1– 200 kHz low frequency range, the 0.1–100 MHz middle frequency range and a 1– 2 GHz microwave range. The kHz range sensors feature interdigited EIS-like electrodes, the MHz range sensors are constituted of 3 reflectometric capacitive sensors of various sizes, and the GHz range sensors are constituted of 2 coplanar waveguide transmission lines. The sensors were designed so as to investigate the SAUT at various skin depths, allowing glucose induced dielectric changes to be sensed within the underlying tissues, or non-glucose related changes e.g. due to skin-sweat or temperature changes, to be sensed in the upper skin layers. All dielectric sensors are integrated within the same sensory plateform, set on a bandage like device placed around the arm, together with conventional sweat, temperature and optical diffuse reflectance sensors. Statistical clinical studies highlighted the correlation of the developed non invasive multisensory data-fused glucose monitoring approach, with observed blood glucose concentrations [159].\nAs illustrated above, reflectometric dielectric sensors are relevant for non-invasive ex vivo or in vivo implementations on tissues. For practical reasons transmission methods are less suitable for this kind of characterizations since the\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 295\nconsidered sample should be inserted into the waveguide [156]. However waveguide transmission sensing techniques find wide applications in microfluidic characterization devices, where micro-device designs allow micro-strip transmission lines to be judiciously combined with microfluidic channels. For example, Leroy et al. [160] proposed a microfuidic biosensor designed for the dielectric spectroscopy of micro-scale particules flowing in a microchannel. The sensor is based on a discontinuated coplanar microstrip transmission line, constituted of 15 µm thick gold electroplated electrodes deposited on a fused silicate substrate. The microstrip line discontinuity is designed to form a capacitive sensor in a detection micro-area, above which a SU8 microchannel are patterned and covered with a PDMS top (Fig. 6.26a). Dielectric measurements are performed on 12 µm diameter polystyrene beads up to 8 GHz, through the measurement of the transmission coefficient S21 of the transmission line carried out by a VNA. Measurements clearly demonstrate the ability of the device to sense the presence of single particule suspended in a di-ionized water solution, with a 1fF capacitance contrast. Similar experiments conducted with a 5 GHz resonant implementation allows 10 MHz resonance shift to be observed with single beads, from which adequate post processing computations enable the permittivity of the bead to be estimated. Finally, trials carried out on cancerous colorectal cells showed promising results, although dispersions in the size of the cells make the post processed estimation of the cell permittivity less accurate than that obtained with calibrated beads. Grenier et al. proposed a biosensor based on the use of a coplanar transmission line with a fluidic channel integrated on the top surface (Fig. 6.26b) [161]. The device is implemented as a two-port transmission sensor operated in the 0.4–35 GHz, and used to quantify the concentration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells suspended in a sucrose and fetal bovine water-based solution. The complex permittivity of the biological solution was estimated from the measured S21 parameter through a dedicated de-embedding technique and modeling of the measurements using numerical computations a Cole-Cole modeling. A 100% change in the relative permittivity was observed between the cell-free solution and the 100% cell concentration fluid at 20 GHz, validating the relevance of the developed device as a non invasive label-free biosensor allowing cell quantification and counting to be carried out.\nA last example is provided by the sensor developed in [162], which aim at distinguishing the inner content of cells in order to discriminate cancer cell according to their evolution stage, by means of waveguide transmission based microfluidic biosensors. The developed sensor is a resonating device constituted of a meandered inductor and two inter-digitated comb capacitors set in parallel and implemented in a microwave coplanar waveguide, integrated with a SU8 patterned chamber on the top (Fig. 6.26c). The device acts as a stop-band transmission line for which the S21 coefficient shows a minimum value at the resonance frequency of the formed LC resonator. Cells are deposited in the chamber using a droplet technique, and are trapped within the inter-digitated comb capacitor fingers (Fig. 6.26c). The presence of cells locally modifies the inter-digitated comb capacitor capacitance, and hence the resonance frequency of the whole resonator. For example, the presence of two cells in the chamber induces a shift of the S21\n296 H. Lee et al.\nresonance frequency of 89 MHz, for a 7 GHz cell-free sensor resonance. The study carried out on various cell lines allowed a clear correlation to be established between cell lines—especially between cells with low and high aggressiveness levels—and the electromagnetic signature constructed from measurements provided by the implemented biosensor and Cole-Cole modeling."

      "text" : "EIS and waveguide based dielectric sensing methods use probes or sensors requiring an electrical contact with the organic material under test. These techniques are proved relevant however induce some possible contact issues including biocompatibility, loss of accuracy, loss of non-invasivity or comfort in the case of in vivo or wearable devices [156, 163]. For that reasons, free space or non-contact sensing techniques have been developed. In the low frequency spectrum (kHz up to tens of MHz), inductive methods generally referred as magnetic impedance techniques (MIT), use a non-contact magnetic coupling induced between an inductive\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 297\nantenna and the organic material to electrically characterize the material under test [119]. However, in practice, these techniques are mostly sensitive to conductivity changes occurring in the organic material, and are hardly sensitive to the dielectric constant [164, 165]. In the upper range of the RF and MW frequencies (1– 100 GHz), free space techniques using MW antennas and RADAR imaging based approaches have been developed for non-contact and non-invasive dielectric characterizations especially for breast cancer detections [122, 166–168]. More recently, integrated systems operating in the 1–10 GHz band based on time domain multi-static RADAR techniques involving antenna arrays have been developed and previous clinical validations have been obtained for the efficient detection and localization of beast tumors [169, 170]. These systems allow advanced 2D dielectric image reconstructions to be achieved, and offer highly promising perspectives in terms of large scale development of low cost and easy to use breast cancer diagnosis devices.\nMicrowave bandwidth contact-free dielectric sensors often operate in the c-dispersion area of tissues (Fig. 6.21), where the polarization of water molecules is mainly responsible for the dielectric behaviour of the tissue. Frequencies higher than the GHz are therefore relevant to investigate cancerous tissues since they feature increased vascularization compared to normal tissues. However GHz sensors are hardly sensitive to the conductivity of organic materials, although tumors and other tissue pathologies are known to features changes of both the real and imaginary part of the complex permittivity [116]. For that reasons, midrange RF frequency inductive techniques operating in the tens to hundreds of MHz bandwidth and related to the b-dispersion, have been developed for the non-contact assessment of the complex permittivity of organic materials.\nFor example, the technique developed in [171] is based on the use flat multi-turn split-conductor transmission-line resonator (MTLR) [172] distantly interacting as a transmit and receive inductive sensor with the considered organic material. The MTLR is monitored by a distant control coil fed with a low intensity RF current. When electromagnetically excited by the coil, the resonator generates an amplified RF magnetic field and induces the circulation of eddy currents and displacement currents within the organic material which depend on its dielectric properties. By reciprocity these currents modify the generated magnetic field, and hence, the impedance of the RF resonator. As a result, the measurement of the resonator impedance gives access to the dielectric properties of the investigated material. It is actually carried out through the evaluation of the impedance changes induced at the ends of the control coil (Zmes) electromagnetically coupled to the resonator, by means of a VNA equipped with an impedance measurement kit. The whole set up is modeled by an equivalent electrical model as depicted in Fig. 6.27. [171]. In this electrical model, the Rc and Lc stand for the control coil, R1, L1, C1 are the equivalent electrical lump elements of the MTLR, and Ri, Li are the additional lumped elements induced by the conductivity and the permittivity of the material loading the MTLR, respectively [173]. Experimental feasibility of organic material\n298 H. Lee et al.\nnon-contact characterization was realized for the in-line monitoring of milk fermentation during yogurt formation in [174]. To do so, milk solutions acidified with various concentrations of glucono-d-lactone (GDL) were considered. The solutions were incubated at 37 °C so that micelles of casein aggregate under the combined action of the GDL and temperature, and so that the jellification process starts. Since the acidified milk solution features typical dielectric properties of r 1.1 S/m and er 65, the MTLR was designed so that the resonance frequency is around 300 MHz (according to Eq. 6.117). As a result, the used MTLR is a planar 19 mm large resonator constituted of two rolled-up 1 mm width transmission lines constituted of 35 lm-thick copper tracks deposited by photolithography on each side of a 250 lm-thick low-loss dielectric substrate (CuFlon). The designed MTLR features a practical resonance frequency f0 = 306 MHz. The non-contact dielectric monitoring system was implemented during the jellification process of milk solutions featuring GDL concentrations of 13–26 g/l of GDL, and the dielectric parameters where extracted from the measurement of Zmes using the electrical equivalent model (Fig. 6.27) and a calibration procedure implemented using a calibrated NaCl solution [175]. The resulting time evolution of both dielectric parameters is presented in Fig. 6.28. The observed conductivity and relative permittivity behaviour and kinetics are induced by the structural changes of the organic material during jellification, and are consistent with those observed with contact techniques [176]. Such non-contact approach offers interesting perspectives for the design of wearable sensors such bandage-like devices allowing the non-contact monitoring of wound healing or glucose content.\n6 Electricity for Fluidics and Bio-Devices 299"

This is usually the case of atoms with closed-shell electronic structures, either monoatomic rare gases, model ionic solids like NaCl, or covalent solids like diamond, silicon or germanium. Superconductors are perfect diamagnets, with a magnetic susceptibility of −1. When subjected to an applied magnetic field, the diamagnetic substance develops a negative moment, proportional to the field.\nThe theory of diamagnetism, initiated by Paul Langevin in early 20th century, considers that the applied field reduces the effective current of the electron orbits, which results in a magnetic moment that is opposite to the applied field.\nIn diamagnetic substances, the susceptibility does not vary with temperature (values of dimensionless volumetric magnetic susceptibility v (SI) of various diamagnetic substances, fluids and solids, are reported in Table 7.1). Note that a superconductor is a perfect diamagnet with a susceptibility of −1. According to the above discussion, the experienced magnetic force thus scales with rH2. Diamagnetic substances are therefore repelled from the regions of maximum magnetic field.\nIn general, organic matter is diamagnetic, and animal bodies have therefore an effective diamagnetic behavior. If the repelling force compensates for gravity, levitation can happen, as demonstrated in the experiment of A. Geim and M. Berry who made a frog fly over a superconducting coil. They received for it the Ig Nobel price in 2000.\nAlthough diamagnets are generally considered insensitive to magnetic fields gradients as their intrinsic magnetic susceptibility are the smallest of all materials, significant response can be obtained by adjusting the magnetic susceptibility contrast between the diamagnetic object and its surrounding medium. For instance, in microfluidic devices, the medium can be doped with paramagnetic substances."

Its generalization led to the so-called Curie-Weiss equation that establishes the relation between the magnetic susceptibility, v, and the temperature as:\nv ¼ C 0\nT h ð7:8Þ\nwith C′ a constant, and h a parameter that depends on the material. In his simple description, Langevin assumed that the atoms in the material exhibit a net magnetic moment, which results from the fact that all spins and orbital moments of an atom do not cancel out. The atomic magnetic moments, hold by the unpaired electrons, do not interact with each other. In the absence of external magnetic field, the moments point in random directions, globally compensating for each other. Therefore, there is no net magnetization. When a magnetic field is applied, the moments tend to align with the field, but the thermal fluctuation impedes the alignment. Therefore, paramagnet present relatively small magnetic susceptibility that decays with the increase of temperature. From this description, if lat represents the atomic moment (here we assume they are all the same), the magnetization M of the paramagnet is given by the so-called Langevin function that is:\nM ¼ M0 coth l0latHkBT\nkBT l0latH\nð7:9Þ\nwhere M0 is the maximum magnetization that the paramagnet can reach (all the magnetic moments are aligned with the applied field).\nM0 is the product of the volume density of atoms n (in m −3) and the atomic\nmoment latðM0 ¼ nlatÞ, H the applied field, kB the Boltzmann constant.

      "text" : "To describe ferromagnets and ferrimagnets, Weiss introduced in 1907 the notion of molecular field, which accounts for interactions between all individual atomic moments, and is proportional to the magnetization. This field does not exist in reality but it is a convenient way to approximate the effect of interactions between atomic moments, which is described in quantum mechanics by the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. In the case of ferromagnets, two adjacent magnetic moments are coupled parallel while in ferrimagnets there exists two sublattices holding different magnetic moments and coupled antiparallel. The strength of the interaction between two adjacent moments is characterized by the exchange stiffness A. Values of A for some ferromagnetic substances are reported in Table 7.3. The characteristic of ferromagnets (and ferrimagnets) is its spontaneous magnetization MS, which represents the alignment of magnetic moments located on a crystal lattice. In the absence of magnetic field, the moments tend to align on preferential directions. The associated magnetic energy landscape that determines the orientation of the magnetization in the absence of any applied magnetic field is the magnetic anisotropy energy. Above a critical temperature that is named the Curie point, the magnetic order is abruptly reduced and the substance becomes a paramagnet. The Curie temperature can be as high as 1400 K (cobalt). It scales with the abovementioned exchange stiffness A. Apart from the spontaneous magnetization, ferromagnets are characterized by their structure in magnetic domains, already suggested by Weiss as an explanation for the absence of any remanent magnetization in a large fraction of ferromagnetic substances like iron. The domain structure results from a compromise between the exchange interactions between adjacent atomic moments that tends to\nSubstance v (Unit: 10−6 [SI]) Al 20 Ca 22 Mg 12\nPd 805\nGd 476300\nalign them collinearly, the minimization of a self-energy term, also referred as magnetostatic energy, due to the dipole field that is created by the magnetization, and the anisotropy. Inside a ferromagnetic (or a ferrimagnetic) substance, the dipole field is named demagnetizing field, as it points in the opposite direction with respect to the magnetization.\nIn magnetically-hard compounds, the magnetic anisotropy energy is large enough to dominates over the magnetostatic energy term and the magnetic domains can remain significantly uncompensated when the applied field is removed. The net magnetization when the field is brought to zero is called the remanent magnetization (MR). The applied field needed to bring the net magnetization to zero is called the coercive field. In contrast, the magnetic domains are compensated in magnetically-soft substances in which the anisotropy term is relatively small. Figure 7.3 shows characteristic magnetization curves for hard and soft ferromagnets. MR and HC are the remanent magnetization and the coercive field, respectively.\nIn most cases, the anisotropy originates from the crystalline structure. A high degree of symmetry, like in cubic lattices, leads to magnetic softness while a lower degree of symmetry, like hexagonal and tetragonal lattices leads to magnetic\nMaterial MS (kA/m) K1 (kJ/m 3) A (pJ/m) Fe 1710 48 21\nCo 1440 410 31\nNi 488 −5 8\nNi80Fe20 840 0.15 10 Fe3O4 (magnetite) 480 −13 7 c-Fe2O3 (maghemite) 400 4.6 (10)\nCoPt 810 4900 10\nSmCo5 860 17200 12 Nd2Fe14B 1280 4900 8\nhardness.

In general, the demagnetizing field is not uniform within the volume of the ferromagnetic substance, except in ellipsoid shapes. Approximating the shape to an ellipsoid permits to predict the magnetic response to an applied field as the susceptibility is given by the simple following expression:\nv ¼ v0 1þNv0\nð7:12Þ\nwhere N is a shape-dependent parameter called the demagnetizing factor (with values between 0 and 1), v0 the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility (related to the relative dimensionless magnetic permeability of the material, lr, by v0 ¼ lr 1).\nThe way to estimate the demagnetizing factor is discussed in the following (Sect. 7.3.3) in the context of the integration of magnetic flux concentrators.\nIn the case of objects of spherical shape, like for magnetic particles, the demagnetizing factor is equal to 1/3."

      "text" : "The magnetic structure of nano-sized ferromagnets is usually single domain. Below a certain critical size, the energy cost of creating a domain wall is higher than the cost of magnetostatic energy. A well-established picture considers that all the magnetic moments of the object rotate coherently, and so add up to form giant magnetic moments, called macrospin. This model, known as the Stoner-Wohlfarth model, was proposed by two theoretical physicists, Edmund Clifton Stoner and Erich Peter Wohlfarth, in 1948. Note that if this model can well describe the magnetization reversal in the smallest size, it is often observed that before the magnetic structure breaks into multi-domain, the system loses the coherent rotation leading to other mechanism like curling reversal. It is also often observed that the anisotropy has a dominant uniaxial symmetry term, which can be originated from slightly elongated shape. Thus, a simple but commonly encountered model used to describe nano-sized ferromagnet is a macrospin with its magnetic anisotropy energy having two minima at 180° from each other. This is represented in Fig. 7.4.\nThe anisotropy energy barrier separating two minima can be expressed as the product of an effective anisotropy constant Keff (in J/m\n3) and the volume of the object V. In the bulk, the anisotropy constant K1 varies over a wide range, it is of the order of 1–10 kJ/m3 for relatively soft ferromagnets and 103–104 kJ/m3 for hard ferromagnets. When a field is applied, the energy barrier becomes asymmetric, one of the two energy wells is the favored compared to the other and thus the energy\n7 Magnetophoresis in Bio-Devices 317\nbarrier is reduced. Néel proposed that the macrospin would flip its orientation at a time that follows an Arrhenius law:\ns ¼ s0exp Keff VkBT\nð7:13Þ\n1=s0 is the attempt frequency, typically of the order of 1 GHz, which is the ferromagnetic resonance frequency in the demagnetizing field. There is a continuous variation of the relaxation time with temperature. Assuming a measurement time of about 100 s in magnetometers, a commonly used figure of merit is the so called blocking temperature, that corresponds to the temperature for which: KeffV ¼ 25 kBT . Figure 7.5 displays the temperature dependence of the relaxation times for Fe nanoparticles.\nTable 7.4 gives the uniaxial term of the anisotropy for benchmark ferromagnets and some critical sizes: Dcoh is the maximum particle diameter for coherent rotation and Dsp is the maximum diameter for «stable» magnetization direction.\nlex reflects the compromise between the exchange energy that align two adjacent magnetic moments and the magnetostatic energy.\nFar from the blocking state (i.e. for measuring time greater than the Néel relaxation time), an ensemble of non-interacting macrospins in the superparamagnetic state responds to an applied field as a paramagnet with giant elementary moments, typically in the order of 102 to 104 µB, while it is of the order of few µB in paramagnet. As a consequence, there is no remanence magnetization and the magnetization curve is similar to the one reported in Fig. 7.3b. Therefore, one can describe the system magnetization with a Langevin function of the form:\nM ¼ M0 coth MSVPHkBT\nkBT MSVPH\nð7:14Þ\nwhere VP is the volume of the particle, MS its spontaneous magnetization and M0 the magnetization of the particle ensemble.\nAt relative low field, the magnetization of the ensemble varies linearly with the applied field, and the susceptibility is:\nv ¼ l0n MSVPð Þ 2\n3kBT ð7:15Þ\nwhere n is the volume density of particles. As compared to paramagnetic substances, the field needed to reach saturation is relatively low, of the order of 101–102 kA/m. When the applied field is greater than this critical value, the magnetization of the particle saturates and the susceptibility can then be expressed as:\nv ¼ nMSVP H\nð7:16Þ\nMost of the objects that are manipulated in microfluidic devices are superparamagnetic. They can be either individual nanoparticles or composites particles that are composed of nanoparticles embedded in a non-magnetic matrix.\n7 Magnetophoresis in Bio-Devices 319"

This coefficient is frequently ignored for experiments in which the particle radius is relatively small compared to the dimensions of the channel. In case of cell labeled with magnetic particle, the apparent radius can be estimated according to the size of magnetic particles relative to that of the cells.\nIn most microfluidic applications, the fluid flow profile is not uniform but varies along the channel section (see laminar flow in Chap. 2). However, particles diameter being usually smaller than dimensions of microfluidic channel dimensions, the fluid velocity is considered relatively constant across the particle [23]. The drag force, given by Eq. (7.25), is then estimated at a time t, with particle velocity at t and fluid flow velocity at the position of the particle at t. Most of the publications related to magnetophoretic functions in microfluidic devices assume that the fluid has an average velocity in the entire channel section. See Chap. 2 to take into account vf profile depending on the position of the particle in that channel for various section shape i.e. rectangular, triangular, cylindrical and aspect ratio.\nDrag force is typically in the order of few to few tens of pN in microfluidic devices.

Particle/micro-channel wall interactions result from electrostatic and electrodynamic (van der Waals) forces experienced by particles in solution. Indeed, particle and micro-channel walls in contact with electrolytic solution can present a surface charge that induces a double-layer at their surface and their overlapping induces electrostatic interactions [19]. Van der Waals force, on its hand, originates from attractive electromagnetic interaction between electrical dipole and/or induced dipoles [19]. Both forces can generate unwanted particle sticking to the micro-channel walls. This can be avoided by modifying the pH and the ionic strength of the solution or by coating micro-channel wall or particle surfaces with proteins (Bovine Serum Albumin, BSA for example) [1]. These forces quickly decrease as the distance between surfaces increases and are negligible at distances greater than tens of nanometers. Particle/particle interactions can be electrostatic and magnetic. Electrostatics ones, generated by the electric double-layers, are repulsive forces whereas magnetic interactions between particles can lead to the creation of particle clusters that possess their own dynamics [1]. These inter-particle effects as well as particle/fluid interactions are usually ignored for particle suspension at low volume concentration [25, 26].

Particles suspended in a fluid undergo random collisions with fluid molecules, generating a random movement of particles, the Brownian motion. Particle diffusion due to Brownian motion is neglected for particles having diameter greater than tens of nanometer. Gerber and co-workers [26] defined a criterion to estimate particle diameter, Dp, below which Brownian motion influences particle displacement:\nF ! Dp kB T ð7:28Þ\n324 A.-L. Deman and D.

For particles with a diameter below or equal to Dp, motion of individual particle is predicted using drift-diffusion analysis, whereas for particle with diameter larger than Dp, Brownian motion is neglected and classical Newtonian physics is employed to foresee particle trajectory.\nIn the first case, because of thermal agitation and diffusion, particle transport cannot be precisely monitored and a statistic approach must be used to predict their trajectories. Particle transport is modeled using a drift-diffusion equation for the particle volume concentration c:\n@c @t ¼ r!

For details to solve Drift-diffusion transport see initial work of Gerber [27], Fletcher [28], and more recently wok of Furlani [29].\nThe second model is the most commonly used in literature, as micro- and nano-objects that are mainly manipulated in magnetophoretic microsystems have a diameter larger than Dp.

Thereby, for the inertial term to be considered particle with a mass of 1 pg should have acceleration above 100 m/s2, which is unusually large for microfluidic applications.

Based on the choices made, it results that magnetophoretic force is mainly in competition with the drag force.

Therefore, the force per volume of target object (with magnetization of 100 kA m−1) will be of the order of 10−21 N/nm3. For particles with a size of 10 nm, this leads to a force in the range of 1 aN (1 attoNewton = 10−18 N), a value comparable to the gravity force acting on them.

The magnetization is a bulk property, it does not depend on the size of the object: a large magnet and a small magnet with the same magnetization are capable of creating similar magnetic field around them. On the other hand, the distance on which the magnetic stray field decays scales with the size of the object. Therefore, there is a remarkable advantage to reduce the size of magnetic flux sources as it increases the gradient of the produced magnetic stray field. Figure 7.9 shows the pattern of magnetic stray field around a magnet with a square section of side a, magnetized upwards.\nIn other words, reducing the size of a magnet by a factor k multiplies the maximum field gradient by k. For micrometer size magnets, the stray field gradient is in the range of 103–106 T/m. For the same target particle as considered in the introduction of this section, the force that was 1 aN with a centimeter sized magnet, is increased to the range of 1–103 fN (1 fN = 10−15 N), a value well greater than the gravity force.\nInterestingly, downscaling coils is also favorable as the admissible current density can be increased while reducing the size of the conductor. Indeed, Joule heating scales with the volume of the conductor whereas cooling losses through heat flow is proportional to the surface [35]."

However electric current flowing in a resistive wire inevitably produces heat that is called Joule, ohmic or resistive heating. This limits the current intensity but also the number of windings as the resistance of the coil scales with the length of the conductor. The maximum amplitude of magnetic induction reached with micro-coils is in the range of 1 to 10 mT. It could be enhanced by adding a magnetic core at the center that would concentrate the flux, as for bulk electromagnets.\nWhen the micro-coil design integrates several turns, independently to the selected geometry, classical approach combining electrodeposition and photolithography leads to relatively tedious processes, as compared to the fabrication of other magnetic flux micro-sources. It is interesting to note that this could be overcome by exploiting the complex and fine structures in nature, as demonstrated by Kamata et al., who prepared micro-coils using helical microalgae as a biotemplate [40].\nDue to relatively low performances in static conditions with respect to the other options, micro-coils are rarely used in this framework but have a great potential for actuators operating at high frequency.\nMoreover, the possibility to alternate the produced flux at a time scale below the relaxation times of the superparamagnetic particles could be a way to exploit the bi-directionality of the magnetic force and thus open a new route of development."

      "text" : "Permanent magnets define objects that produce magnetic stray field in their environment, in the absence of external excitation, such as a circulating current or a magnetic field. This particularity implies that the predominant constituting phase retains a fraction of its magnetization, which is called the remanent magnetization. An important ingredient is the magnetic anisotropy. The large majority of produced permanent magnets nowadays get their hard properties from a large magneto-crystalline anisotropy. When looking back at the evolution of permanent magnet performances over the last century, the main achievements came with the discovery of new hard magnetic compounds. The main breakthrough came in the 1950’s with the discovery of ferrimagnetic hexagonal ferrites, of which the high anisotropy permits to manufacture them in any shape and so opening new possibilities for device designs.\nThe magnetic performances of magnets are generally assessed by a figure of merit called the energy product, denoted (BH)max, which scales the amount of energy stored in the stray field. It corresponds to a working point on the induction curve B(H) that maximizes the area under the curve in its second quadrant (see Fig. 7.12). A high (BH)max reflects a high enough resistance to demagnetization and a large magnetization. Beyond a certain value of coercive field HC, the maximum energy product is only a function of M. In fact a hard magnetic phase is characterized by a maximum theoretical energy product that is:\nBHð ÞMAX¼ 1 4 l0M 2 S ð7:36Þ\nTable 7.6 gives characteristic parameters for some hard magnetic substances. When using magnets as magnetic flux sources, one exploits its stray field, which is\n7 Magnetophoresis in Bio-Devices 331\nthe field created outside its volume. In general, the stray field is calculated using either the Amperian approach, in which the magnetization is replaced by an equivalent distribution of current density, or the Coulombian approach, in which the magnetization is replaced by an equivalent distribution of magnetic charges. The two approaches are illustrated in Fig. 7.13 for a uniformly magnetized cubic magnet.\nThe calculation of magnetic stray field is general performed by finite element method, though analytical solutions for simple shapes can be found in literature [43].\nFabrication of Bulk Magnets\nBulk magnets are generally prepared by powder metallurgical processes, which can be briefly summarized as follows: (1) a mixture of the raw elements is first molten in furnaces and cooled down to form cast magnets, (2) the obtained material is then either ball milled or jet milled to obtain fine powders, with particle sizes ranging from few micrometers up to hundreds of micrometers, (3) this powder is then pressed into molds and heated to be sintered. The as obtained «sintered magnets»\n332 A.-L. Deman and D. Le Roy\nare relatively dense (density greater than 90%) but brittle. A solution to obtain more mechanically robust magnets is to bond the fine powder with a polymer, thus facilitating magnets shaping, for example by injection moulding, which opens up new possibilities for device designers. In addition, these so called «bonded magnets» show higher resistance to corrosion. However, they present less magnetization than their sintered magnets counterparts because of the relatively large volume fraction of non-magnetic binder (the volume fraction of the magnetic powder is typically 60–80%). Typical binders used are epoxy resin, polyamides or nitrile rubbers. Schematics of Fig. 7.14 show the different microstructures of magnets.\nClassification of Permanent Magnets\nOne can put magnets in four categories, according to the constituting elements and structure: hexagonal ferrites, alnicos, metal alloys and rare-earth intermetallics. They all have their advantages and weaknesses. Hard hexagonal ferrites have the general formula MO–6(Fe2O3), with M being mostly Sr or Ba. They are produced nowadays in large quantity, in the range of 106 tons/year. They have limited performances but present the great advantages of being cheap and excellent resistance to corrosion. Alnicos are nanostructured materials consisting of Fe–Co needles in a non magnetic Al-Ni matrix, with traces of Cu and Ti. They are obtained by spinodal decomposition and the anisotropic nanostructure is obtained by means of thermal process under magnetic field. They present good thermal stability, relatively high magnetization but suffer from relatively low resistance to demagnetization and therefore are generally found in rod shapes. Hard metal alloys are usually made by direct casting of 3d transition metal elements taken among Mn, Fe, Co, Ni with other metallic elements, of various types like Ga, Al, Pd, Pt, Bi. They have in common a non-cubic structure. Binary L10 alloys like FePt and CoPt present impressive hard magnetic properties and good resistance to corrosion but suffer from the high cost of Pt. Rare-earth intermetallic magnets, like NdFeB–based magnet, show the highest magnetic performances and are relatively low cost. Their main weakness is their poor resistance to corrosion, which requires coating them in order to limit degradation over time. For use in microfluidic systems intended for biology, the operating temperature window is rather restricted to a narrow range,\n7 Magnetophoresis in Bio-Devices 333\ntypically 10–40 °C, where all magnets described above can be used with relatively steady performances.\nIntegration of Permanent Micromagnets in Microsystems\nThe integration of permanent magnets in microsystems is challenging mainly because hard magnetic properties are highly sensitive to both chemical composition (alloy composition, structure, chemical order) and microstructure (grain size, grain boundary phases, defects). This usually implies some preparation constraints like thermal treatments, or sometimes processing steps under magnetic field. In addition, once prepared it is necessary to apply a strong external magnetic field so that to get a maximum remanent magnetization.\nMicro-Magnets Fabrication Routes\nMachining bulk high performance sintered magnets to obtain sub-millimeter sized magnets, for example by spark cut, is restricted to relatively coarse features as inevitable degradation of the surface will be detrimental for the magnetic hardness. In addition, machining or deforming bulk magnets is not suitable for preparing micro-pattern arrays.\nInstead, two main approaches were developed to fabricate such micro-magnet arrays: patterning of films or powder positioning.\nSeveral film deposition and patterning methods can be used, including sputtering [44], pulsed-laser deposition [45], evaporation [46], or electrochemical deposition [47]. Electro-deposition has been found as an efficient way to prepare thick films of rare earth-free magnetic films. Pulsed laser deposition technique is usually restricted to relatively low deposition rate and relatively small deposition areas, and is difficult to scale up. Sputtering, like electrochemical deposition, can be adapted for deposition on large areas and with relatively high deposition rates of 10–40 µm/h [48].\nFilms can be topographically patterned depositing them on thick resist masks and then performing lift-off [49], or else onto pre-etched substrates (predominantly silicon) using deep reactive ion etching [50]. For hard magnetic compounds that are less sensitive to corrosion (rare-earth free magnetic films), an additional option is to pattern the films, post deposition, through wet etching or focused ion beam. The as-obtained arrays of permanent micro-magnets are heated to form the hard magnetic phase, either during deposition, or with post-deposition annealing, and then magnetized in the unidirectional field of a superconducting coil to reach the full remanence of the micro-magnets.\nLocal change of the structure or of the chemical order can be another route to obtain patterned hard magnetic films at the micrometer scale. As an example, Okuda et al. induced local magnetic hardness in NdFeB film that were initially poorly crystallized and so magnetically soft, by employing pulsed annealing through a mask [51].\nOther approaches were developed to create such multipolar structures in continuous magnet films, magnetized locally in opposite directions. To reverse the magnetization in specific zones, one can use electrical pulses in conducting wires positioned in contact to the film [52, 53], or else using the so-called\n334 A.-L. Deman and D. Le Roy\nthermo-magnetic patterning [54], which consists in locally reversing the magnetization of a uniformly magnetized film by heating micrometer-sized areas with a laser pulse through a mask, under moderate magnetic field. The process is schematized in Fig. 7.15. The advantages of this method are that it creates multipolar configuration that is favorable for magnetic stray field strength and the absence of topography patterns facilitates the integration in devices. The main disadvantage is the rather limited reported depth (less than 2 µm) of the magnetization reversal. Other means to reverse locally the magnetization of hard films have been proposed since, using soft ferromagnetic masks that locally concentrates magnetic flux in the opposite direction with respect to the initial film magnetization direction [55].\nFilm-based techniques offer the great advantages of reproducibility, and fine controls over geometries and microstructuration. However, they suffer from a tendency of peeling off from the substrate due to mechanical stress building-up in thick deposited films. Also, their fabrication processes are relatively expensive, slow and tedious. As the hard magnetic phases are usually obtained after heat treatment, the thermal expansion coefficients of the film and the substrate may set an upper limit on the film thickness.\nMethods to transfer well-defined arrays of film-based structures in polymer matrix were developed in order to ease the integration in polymer-based microsystems [56–59].\nIn contrast to film-based methods, powder-based methods employ particles used in bulk-manufactured magnet industry as building blocks, which have already desired hard magnetic properties. Bonded micro-magnet arrays are generally obtained by filling cavities present in resist masks or pre-etched silicon substrates with a mixture of magnetic powder and a polymer binder. Among the most ubiquitous techniques of fabrication, one can cite replica molding, squeegee coating or screen printing. Other techniques like inkjet printing do not use physical master. Note that generally the powder-based approaches integrate a process step with an applied magnetic field in order to align the particles and confer an overall anisotropy to the bonded micro-patterns. In order to go down in sizes, it is also possible\n7 Magnetophoresis in Bio-Devices 335\nto use magnetic molds to precisely position magnetic particles on a surface and then transfer the formed pattern arrays in a medium like a polymer [60].\nMany efforts were done to develop high performance micro-magnets, in various contexts and geometries. The performances are assessed by local characterization of the stray field, and its gradient using magneto-optical indicator films (MOIF) [59], Hall micro-probes [56, 61] or measurements of forces exerted on “colloidal tips” in a magnetic force microscopy set up.\nIn the context of microfluidic systems integrating magnetophoretic forces, the micro-magnets offer the great advantage of producing strong stray fields without any external excitation, which is beneficial for compact and low-power consumption devices. The main disadvantage of micro-magnets is that the generated force pattern cannot be easily modulated in real-time. This can be an issue to consider when releasing the trapped object is desired. Using magnetically-soft ferromagnets can be a way to overcome this limitation."

      "text" : "The “micro-magnet” term is often abusively used to refer magnetically-soft micro-patterns, although a magnet is characterized by its ability to retain a fraction of its magnetization when the field is removed. Here we make the distinction between micro-magnets and magnetically-soft micro-patterns that only become magnetized in the presence of an external magnetic field. They are used to concentrate an external magnetic flux that can be delivered either by an electric circuit or a permanent magnet. In the absence of external field, the soft magnetic object structure collapses in multi-domains and there is no stray field. Micro-concentrators are characterized by a large change of their magnetization state when submitted to a relatively low external magnetic field. The performance of the flux guide is related to the intrinsic magnetic permeability µ of the constituting material. The higher the magnetic permeability, the more concentrated the magnetic flux is. In addition to the permeability, an important parameter is the maximum flux the material can concentrate, which is determined by the spontaneous magnetization MS. Figure 7.16 shows the magnetic flux inside and nearby a soft magnetic material that is magnetized in a field of 0.2 T created by bulk magnets.\nTable 7.7 presents some values of magnetization MS and magnetic relative permeability µr of some commonly encountered magnetically-soft materials at room temperature. One can find several classes of magnetically-soft materials: low-carbon mild steels, Fe-Ni alloys, Co-Fe alloys, soft ferrites. They generally result from a compromise between high saturation magnetization and the addition of non-magnetic elements to increase their magnetic softness (among which Al, Si, C, Mo, Cu). Unlike hard magnetic compounds, additional elements are intended to render the alloy amorphous or reduce chemical ordering. These elements can also help to increase electrical resistance so that to improve high frequency performances. In the bulk state, grain-orientation, lamination, annealing under magnetic\n336 A.-L. Deman and D. Le Roy\nfield can be used to induce anisotropy and thus improve magnetic permeability in a desired direction.\nDependence of the Magnetic Response on the Patterns Shape\nWhen one wants to integrate micro-sources of magnetic field gradient in microsystems, it is of first importance to consider the shape contribution to the apparent susceptibility (M/Hext), which will predominate in most cases.\nIn general the demagnetizing field Hd is not uniform within the volume of the object and the use of finite element modeling to describe the magnetic response to an external field is necessary. The demagnetizing field is uniform within ellipsoid shapes (of axes 2a, 2b and 2c, see Fig. 7.17) and it is thus possible to get a rapid estimate of the demagnetizing field by considering the closest ellipsoid shape to the given object. Table 7.8 gives the analytical expressions of the demagnetizing factors for revolution ellipsoids. The apparent susceptibility is then simply related to\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\nB (T)\na (arb. unit)\nthe intrinsic value and the demagnetizing factors along the three orthogonal axes satisfy:\nNa þNb þNc ¼ 1 ð7:37Þ\nFabrication of soft micro-patterns In magnetophoretic microsystems, magnetic flux micro-concentrators are certainly the most used, and this can be partly explained by their ease of micro-fabrication compared to hard magnetic phases that require thermal treatment. Poor cristallinity and low degree of chemical ordering, which is generally obtained in the as prepared state, is not detrimental, and even can be favorable for magnetic softness. This is especially true when we restrict the use to static conditions (variation of the applied field in the Hz range), which is the general case for microfluidic systems integrating magnetophoretic functions.\nFigure 7.18 shows some experimental realizations. Apart from multipolar micro-patterning, all the aforementioned micro-fabrication techniques described in the section devoted to micro-magnet arrays can be applied to micro-concentrators. Film-based methods, where films were micro-patterned to prepare batches of well-defined and fully dense micro-concentrators, are largely employed. Films are prepared by electro-deposition, sputtering, evaporation or pulsed laser deposition [65]. As for micro-magnets, thicknesses ranging from 1 to 100 µm are desired and thus high rate deposition techniques are suitable. Micro-patterning can then be achieved by different methods, including lift-off using photoresist masks [66] or by depositing the films on pre-etched substrates [56].\n338 A.-L. Deman and D. Le Roy\nHowever, film-based methods suffer from high processing cost, and also are limited to suitable substrates using sometimes a buffer layer to ensure adhesion.\nIn contrast, powder compaction and positioning offer the great advantage of low cost processes. Like for permanent micro-magnets, soft powder-loaded polymer composites can be micro-patterned using the same methods as described for composites with hard magnetic powder, including replica molding [67], or ink printing [68, 69]. However, low compaction inevitably leads to additional demagnetizing field effects at the grain scale, which can be detrimental for magnetic susceptibility and so magnetic flux guiding performances. High aspect ratio structures can be obtained by organizing the soft particles in chains within the polymer matrix [70].\nMicro-concentrators of magnetic flux constitute an appealing solution as the reachable magnetic forces are comparable to the ones obtained with permanent micro-magnets but they offer in addition the possibility to modulate the force intensity in real time by varying the external flux. Their fabrication and their integration in microsystems are relatively easier than for micro-magnets as the exploited magnetic properties are less sensitive to micro-fabrication processes."

Objects handled in magnetophoretic devices are magnetic micro- and nano-particles (MMPs and MNPs), magnetically labeled cells and cells presenting intrinsic magnetic properties. Currently, magnetophoretic implementation for biomedical applications is realized following three main strategies, using: (i) external permanent magnet, (ii) integrated permanent magnets and (iii) integrated micro-concentrators of magnetic flux. As explained in Sect. 7.3.1, miniaturization of magnetic material down to micron-scale permits to obtain high magnetic field gradient separator (HGMS) which can be required when small particles or particles with low magnetization are employed in microfluidic systems.\nIn this section, we will describe these three different approaches by highlighting the type of manipulated micro-object. The first paragraph is focused on magnetic particles and the second paragraph deals with magnetic bio-devices."

      "text" : "Magnetic particles (MPs) research fields are multidisciplinary. They require inputs from chemistry, biology, physics, medicine, engineering, whether it concerns their magnetic properties, synthesis, surface functionalization, magnetophoretic manipulation or applications. MNPs possess high surface-to-volume ratio, that is advantageous for detection process, and also magnetic properties that allow their manipulation in the sample as their transport for subsequent sensing functions. They are largely used in biomedical applications such as drug targeting, contrast agent for MRI, specific cell labelling and separation, diagnostic and hyperthermia as reported by those reviews [71–75]. They are also largely exploited in environmental applications mainly to perform pollutant removal or detection [76–79]. In microfluidic devices, manipulation of MPs addresses biomedical applications [4, 80], mainly for cell isolation, immunoassay and DNA extraction, but also environmental [81, 82] applications, for toxin or environmental reagent detection or chemical catalysis [83].\nParticles must meet some general requirements to be compatible with biomedical analysis, i.e. biocompatibility, biodegradability (for in vivo applications), stability in various medium, narrow size distribution and regular shape that largely impact measurement reproducibility. They may also be superparamagnetic, in order to exhibit large magnetization in presence of applied magnetic field to achieve large magnetophoretic forces; and no coercivity, i.e. no remanent magnetization in absence of magnetic field, to allow a switch off of the magnetophoretic force and a better dispersibility in solution.\nMagnetic particles, also called magnetic beads, of different sizes are employed in micro-fluidic devices: nano-particles (10–100 nm), sub-micrometer particles (0.1– 1 µm) and micrometer particles (1–50 µm). Iron oxide particles, magnetite and\n340 A.-L. Deman and D. Le Roy\nmaghemite particles, are the most commonly used. We can also find particles made of pure ferromagnetic metals, Fe, Ni, or Co, alloys such as Permalloy, CoPt3 or FePt and oxide ferrite such as M–Fe2O4 (M being, Mg, Zn, Mn, Ni, Co,…). Different particles properties (magnetization at saturation, maximum diameter for nanoparticles to be superparamagnetic, and critical diameter for particle to switch from single to multi-domains) are given in Table 7.9 for various materials [84–86].\nMNP preparation involves several steps including particle synthesis, coating or encapsulation and functionalization. MNP synthesis is a very active field of research in literature, and many reviews were published those past years [87–89]. Different synthesis pathways are reported: (i) chemical methods such as co-precipitation and thermal decomposition which are the most commonly used; (ii) physical methods, such as gas-phase deposition and electron beam lithography, which struggle to control particle size down to the nanometer scale; and (iii) more recently, microbial method that exploits the ability of bacteria such as Thermoanaebacter species and Shewanella species to synthetize Fe3O4 NP under anaerobic conditions by the reduction of Fe(III). Currently, co-precipitation is preferred for its simplicity and important yield. If MNP shape uniformity is required as well as a narrow particle size distribution, thermal decomposition is favored. Both methods permit to obtain magnetic nanoparticles with typical size ranging from 2 to 50 nm.\nOnce particles are synthetized, a protection layer, impenetrable, can prevent MNP from oxidation or erosion and can also reduce metal degradation and related toxicity (Co, Ni, Mn). This results in MNPs with a core-shell structure, a magnetic core, coated by a shell, isolating the core from the environment. Such MNP surface coating may also improve the colloidal and physical stability of the particles. Coating strategies can be basically divided into two approaches: coating with organic shell (polymers and surfactants) and coating with inorganic materials such as carbon, precious metals (e.g. gold) or oxides (e.g. SiO2). Another approach, which differs from core-shell structure, consists in embedding dispersed MNPs in a dense polymer (e.g. polystyrene) or silica matrix to form composite. Such composite\n7 Magnetophoresis in Bio-Devices 341\nparticles can have different structure depending on synthesis process: (i) MNPS can be dispersed in a continuous matrix, (ii) they can be dispersed on the coating of larger particles, like a shell of MNPs, (iii) they can form agglomerates of individual particles that are connected through their protective shells [90]. This approach permits to obtain micron-size particles, typically 0.1–50 µm, that contain more magnetic materials than primary magnetic nano-particle, and permit to reach higher magnetic forces. They are thus largely used in microfluidic systems. One can notice that larger magnetophoretic forces are exerted on larger particles that contain more magnetic material, giving rise on more efficient magnetic functions, but in that case, gravitational forces are also increased and thus may be considered in forces balance.\nFinally, particles can be functionalized with specific molecules such as nucleic acids, peptides or proteins to provide bio-functionality in order to perform cell isolation, immunoassay and DNA extraction. Proteins can bind/adsorb to hydrophobic surfaces such as the one of polymer-coated particles. Strong binding between the particle surface and the proteins can also be obtained via specific group at the surface beads such as hydroxyl (–OH), carboxyl (–COOH) and amines (–NH2) which via an activating agent bind to –NH2 or –SH groups on the proteins. Bio-functionalization can also be processed via specific and strong complementary recognition interaction such as antigen-antibody or streptavidin-biotin. Various types of functionalized magnetic particles are commercially available [5]. Lists of cancer biomarkers, ligands for viruses and for proteins of biopharmaceutical interest can be found in these articles [5, 84].\nAs a conclusion, ideal properties of MNPs for bio-devices are:\n– superparamagnetic behavior, – spherical shape and narrow size distribution, – physico-chemical robustness, – high binding capacities, – low non-specific binding, – minimal cell perturbations, in case of cell labeling, as describe hereafter."

      "text" : "Manipulation of MNPs or MMPs in bio-devices are mainly dedicated to the detection of biomarkers such as nucleic acids and proteins. Their detection in blood or serum permit avoiding invasive methods, i.e. biopsy, and their detection at low concentrations allows early diagnosis.\nIn the case of nucleic acid detection, the sample preparation requires two primary steps, cell separation and lysis, followed by nucleic acid extraction and purification. Cell sorting can be performed using magnetophoresis approach as discussed hereafter. Once cells have been lysed, a purification step can be realized with different microfluidic functions based on filtration, electrostatic interaction, silica-based surface affinity and functionalized magnetic microparticles [91–93]. Steps following DNA extraction such as mixing of reagents, washing particles containing DNA, incubating them in an elution buffer to detach DNA, and proceeding to PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for subsequent quantification can also be performed in microfluidic device [92, 94, 95, 99]. Bio-devices integrating several steps for DNA quantification using digital microfluidic [97, 98] or in-channel approaches [92–94, 96] are reported in literature. Digital microfluidic (DMF) principle is to control fluid as discrete and individual droplets using an array of independent electrodes on a microchip. DNA extraction using DMF present the advantage of high flexibility allowing MNP separation, mixing with reagent, and washing, while limiting reagent consumption [100]. For example, Hung et al. [98] presented a microchip for genomic DNA extraction from whole blood using DMF. The magnetic bead collection and washing procedures are shown in Fig. 7.19A. After beads and the remnant supernatant merged with Wash Buffer 1, an external permanent magnet created a magnetophoretic force on magnetic beads that were collected toward the magnet. By applying a voltage on the opposite side of the droplet, it was split into two droplets, magnetic beads being collected in one droplet. The washing procedure was pursued with another buffer from another droplet. Based on in-channel approach, Strohmeier et al. [93], proposed an innovative method for magnetic beads transport in multiple microfluidic chambers containing reagents necessary for DNA purification. The strategy was based on the coupling of a centrifugal microfluidic LabDisk with a stationary permanent magnet. As shown in Fig. 7.19B, the microfluidic structure is composed of microfluidic chambers, isoradially arranged on a central microfluidic LabDisk. Chambers were first loaded with liquids. Transportation of magnetic beads in successive chambers was achieved by incremental rotation of the LabDisk with respect to the non-rotative permanent magnet. Based on this preliminary work, they developed a fully automated centrifugal-microfluidic LabDisk system, with pre-stored reagents, that performs DNA extraction and PCR for the detection of a panel of bacterial pathogens [99]. The Lab-disk design and the associated Lab-Disk player for point-of care processing are presented in Fig. 7.19C.\nDNA extraction can also be achieved using micro-concentrators of magnetic flux. For example, Lou et al. [101] proposed a device for micro-magnetic selection\n7 Magnetophoresis in Bio-Devices 343\nof aptamers, nucleic acid molecules, in microfluidic channels using micro-fabricated nickel strips. As shown in Fig. 7.20, the device comprises 3 inlets: two were used to introduce in the channel the sample made of magnetic beads bound to the target aptamers and unbound oligonucleotides, and the central inlet was used to introduce a buffer solution. Because of laminar flow, sample and buffer streams did not mix. By positioning an external magnet under the device, Ni strips focused magnetic field lines and created around them regions of high magnetic field\n344 A.-L. Deman and D. Le Roy\ngradient. Forces generated on magnetic beads deviated them from their trajectory towards the center of the channel, whereas, unbound aptamers were directed into the waste outlet. As a consequence, beads with bonded target nucleotides were exited solely by the product outlet.\nIn the case of proteins, numerous magnetic bio-devices were developed. Different proteins are presents in blood, with concentrations ranging from pg mL−1 to mg mL−1. Low blood sample volume used in microfluidic systems requires techniques with high sensitivity, as no method exists for direct amplification of proteins, as PCR for DNA. Achieving low limit of detection (LOD), is also interesting for detection of toxin and environmental agent in serum, water or food samples. Tekin and Gijs [102] published a review on ultra-sensitive protein detection in microfluidic systems. Immunoassays are mainly used to detect a target protein via the specific recognition between a target antigen (Ag) and an antibody (Ab). Different immunoassay technics are employed, the most commonly used being the sandwich immunoassay.\nMagnetic-immunoassay is currently performed as follow in micro-device: Ab-coated magnetic beads are transported, via magnetic field, towards the region in the micro-channel where Ag are localized. After Ab-Ag immunocomplex formation, magnetic beads can be conveyed to the area of detection, which is also a crucial step to reach low LOD. The last step is the Ag detection, which can be performed either without involving magnetic beads [102] i.e. by fluorescence, electrochemistry, (electro)chemiluminescence or mass spectrometry, or by using magnetic beads as labels [102], i.e. by isomagnetophoresis [103], or by monitoring the coverage of a surface by magnetic beads. Microchips using external magnet are\n7 Magnetophoresis in Bio-Devices 345\nreported in literature. Indeed, Tekin et al. [104] proposed a system using a magnetic bead surface coverage assay (Fig. 7.21A). First large magnetic beads functionalized with primary Ab specifically captured antigen present in a sample using active microfluidic mixing. In a second step, these beads were exposed to a surface patterned with fixed smaller magnetic beads coated with secondary Ab. A permanent magnet was positioned underneath the device. The generated magnetic field gradient forced larger magnetic beads towards the patterned substrate and biomolecular recognition permitted to trap larger beads on smaller ones. Note that the attractive magnetic interaction between the two types of beads improved Ag-Ab immunocomplex formation. Non-specific adsorption of large magnetic beads was limited by exploiting viscous drag force in the channel after magnet removal. Quantification of antigen concentration was performed by counting the number of bounded large beads. Their immunoassay protocol allowed the detection of (TNF-a) with a LOD of 1 fg mL−1.\nTransport of magnetic beads in micro-channel using external magnet was also reported by Sasso et al. [105]. They developed a system in which magnetic beads were pulled from a reagent stream to the next one in the presence of an external magnet. After this transfer, the solution that carries beads was removed via a waste outlet, and beads flowed into the incubation spiral where Ag-Ab recognition occurred. Phurimsak et al. [106] developed a continuous flow reactor that consists in a microfluidic chamber with co-flowing reagent streams dedicated to C-creatine protein (CRP) detection via a sandwich immunoassay and fluorescent label. Functionalized magnetic particles were deflected across the reaction chamber under the influence of magnetic field gradient due to the presence of an external magnet. They crossed alternating streams of reagents and washing buffers as shown in Fig. 7.21B. The strategy of using ferromagnetic micro-concentrator field lines was also demonstrated for the detection of proteins. The concentrators were obtained by patterning thin or thick microstructures made of nickel or permalloy [68, 107–109]. Yu et al. [108] realized a microfluidic device integrating a nickel array that was able to trap magnetic beads in eight parallel channels as shown in Fig. 7.21C. The obtained self-assembled Ab-magnetic bead patterns allowed to simultaneously detecting eight different cancer biomarkers in the eight parallel branches of the device. A more anecdotal method that consists in packing micrometric magnetic beads in microfluidic chamber [110] was also published."

      "text" : "Two approaches are developed to manipulate cells using magnetophoretic forces: label-free approach and the use of magnetic labels on cells.\nLabel-Free Cell Manipulation\nTwo strategies are reported to manipulate label-free cells in magnetic bio-devices: manipulation of diamagnetic cells using ferromagnetic fluids and manipulation of cells possessing intrinsic magnetic properties. Manipulation of diamagnetic cells\n346 A.-L. Deman and D. Le Roy\nremains challenging, in particular regarding ferrofluids biocompatibility. The reader can find information on this approach in these reviews [4, 111, 112]. In contrast, cells with intrinsic magnetic properties (deoxygenated red blood cells (RBC), and malaria infected RBCs) can be manipulated in bio-devices using standard aqueous buffers.\nRed blood cells (RBC) have a paramagnetic behavior when deoxygenated (in veins) and a diamagnetic behavior when oxygenated (in arteries). In RBC vertebrates, hemoglobin is an iron-containing molecule that carries oxygen from the respiratory organs (lungs or gills) to the rest of the body. Oxygenated hemoglobin is diamagnetic due to the presence of paired electrons on its Fe atoms. Deoxyhemoglobin is the form of hemoglobin without the bound oxygen to the Fe\n7 Magnetophoresis in Bio-Devices 347\natoms, thus containing four or five unpaired electrons. As a consequence, deoxyhemoglobin presents a paramagnetic behavior, deoxygenated RBCs have a relative magnetic susceptibility of Dvdeox ¼ vdeoxRBC vwater ¼ 3:310 6 in water. Although this value is relatively small, it allows exerting sufficient magnetic forces on deox-RBCs in order to trap or separate them from other cells in total blood. This was illustrated by Melville et al. [113] in 1975 and since then, numerous works were published with improvement in the efficiency of RBCs recovery [7–9, 114– 118]. For example, Jung et al. [116], developed a microfluidic system with a separation function consisting of six-stages (Fig. 7.22a). This approach allowed separating RBCs from human whole blood sample with a throughput up to 50 µL/h with an efficiency of 86% for RBCs. Each separation stage is a micro-concentrator of magnetic flux of thick ferromagnetic nickel microstructures that allow obtaining magnetic field gradient over the entire channel thickness. A schematic of the device with picture of separation at different stage is shown in Fig. 7.22a.\nBesides general blood separation, magnetophoretic forces were used for separation of malaria infected RBCs (iRBCs) in blood. Human malaria is caused by four types of parasites, among which Plasmodium falciparum being the most fatal. To prosper in RBCs, malaria parasite needs to clear out hemoglobin which is toxic to them. They convert it in an insoluble crystal known as hemozoin. The ion Fe3+ in hemozoin has a stronger paramagnetic character than iron in hemoglobin (Fe2+), and thus increase the infected RBCs magnetic susceptibility relative to water Dv ¼ 1:810 6 compared to oxygenated RBC Dv ¼ 0:1810 6 , while remaining lower than deox RBCs [119, 120]. During infection, P. falciparum parasite is present at different maturation stages in RBCs, late one being the more paramagnetic. Several works were reported in literature to perform separation of\n348 A.-L. Deman and D. Le Roy\niRBCs [121–125]. Nam [123] presented a system dedicated to magnetic separation of iRBCs at various stages of maturation (Fig. 7.22b). Their micro-channel possesses three inlets and two outlets. RBCs and i-RBCs mixture was injected in the central inlet, and sheath fluids were injected from the two side inlets. Their role was to focus RBCs at an optimized distance of the nickel wire. RBCs flowed in the channels, and infected ones were attracted toward the nickel wire due to magnetophoretic forces, whereas healthy ones kept flowing along the focus streamline. Using this device, the obtained recovery rate was 99% for late stage i-RBCs et 73% for early ring stage i-RBCs. Notice that, malaria diagnosis in magnetic bio-devices can also be achieved via detection of parasite biomarkers (proteins) present in whole blood, serum and plasma, using functionalized magnetic beads.\nMagnetically Labeled Cells\nCells that do not possess intrinsic magnetic properties can be magnetically labeled via two approaches: (i) by internalization into the cytoplasm of nanoparticles (by endositosis [126], phagositosis [127] or transfection [128]) and (ii) by attachment of nanoparticles on their surface. The first approach, in which MNP cross the cell membrane and enter the cytoplasm, is mainly dedicated to enable MRI, drug targeted delivery or to study intracellular process. For the second approach, [129] attachment of NP on the cell membrane can be performed through specific ligand-receptor interaction, such as Ag-Ab, specific lectins or other sugar binding protein, avidin and streptavidin, for example. Other technics can be used to magnetically modify cells. For example by coating MNP on cell membrane using electrostatic interactions, binding of ferritin and magnetoferritin, entrapment of cells into biocompatible magnetic polymers and gels… [129]. Note, that it is generally accepted that attached beads do not modify cells viability, except on sensitive cell population such as stem and progenitor cells [14]. Depending on the labeling approach, the expression of the magnetophoretic force can be adjusted. Either the magnetic cell iron content can be estimated using magnetophoretic method [130], or in the particular case of immunomagnetically labeled cells, the magnetic force can be slightly adapted to depict the tagging of a single cell with numerous smaller magnetic particles [131], as expressed in Eq. (7.38)\nFm ! ¼ l0Vpbj#k M!p r! H! ð7:38Þ\nb being the number of nanoparticles conjugated to the targeted Ab, j the number of Ag binding sites per cells, # the fraction of Ag on the cell surface bound by targeted Ab and, k the valence of the Ab binding, i.e. the number of Ag that binds an anti-body, and Vp, the volume of a MNP.\n7 Magnetophoresis in Bio-Devices 349\nThis expression can be modified to take into account binding of secondary Ab to sites present on the primary Ab [132]. The product bj#k, is equivalent to the number of bounded magnetic particles on cells, N, Fm ! can therefore be written as [65]:\nFm ! ¼ N FP ! ð7:39Þ\nFP !\nbeing the force exerted on a single nano-particle.

The cell-particle complex radius can be approximated by:\nR ¼ R3c þR3p 1 3 ð7:42Þ\nMagnetophoretic manipulation of labelled cells in microfluidic devices are mainly focused on separation of white blood cells (WBCs) [133, 134] from blood sample, bacteria from serum or blood sample [135] and rare circulating cells from blood sample [4, 14, 84, 136]. In particular, enrichment of a target cell population and subsequent culture is an important step in the fields of molecular genetics, proteomics, biology and medicine. Regarding biomedical field, many applications require sorting of rare cells that are defined as cells representing less than 1% of the total number of cells. Among examples, we can cite circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating endothelial cells (CEC), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Isolation of rare cells represent a big challenge for diagnostic and monitoring of diseases of strong societal interest such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and prenatal diagnostic. Labeling based on specific attachment of MNPs on the cell membrane, in particular immunomagnetic approach in which a micro- or nano-particles bind to cells through Ab-Ag recognition, suits particularly well this application. This approach is the most widely used in microfluidic systems. At the macroscale, magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) systems consist in attracting labeled cells\n350 A.-L. Deman and D. Le Roy\non a tube wall using an external magnetic field whereas unlabeled cells are eluted. Then target cells are released once the external magnetic field is removed. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Veridex system, CellSearchTM. This apparatus is a commercial system based on MACS method used to detect CTCs and currently employed for clinical diagnosis of breast, colorectal and lung cancers. However, this system works only for EpCAM surface marker expression, limiting its capture efficiency. Downscaling MACS allow portability (point-of care diagnosis), and improved control of magnetic and hydrodynamic forces exerted on target cells in order to achieve better separation efficiency. µMACS is widely employed for CTC detection in microfluidic systems [65, 84, 136].\nThree parameters allow assessing the efficiency of cell separation: (i) the purity, i.e. the number of target cells among separated cells, (ii) the recovery, i.e. the number of separated cells versus the total number of cells or versus the number of target cells in the original suspension, and (iii) the viability of cells, i.e. subsequent capacity of separated cells to be considered as alive with living cell assay or cell culture. Two approaches are reported to address these challenges, positive enrichment, i.e. capturing labeled CTCs and eluting blood cells, or negative selection, i.e. capture labeled blood cells and eluting CTCs. In the first case, recovery and purity rates are reported to be superior. However, this approach presents some limitations. Because of the heterogeneous nature of target cells, they do not all express the same Ags, and some target cells with unknown surface biomarkers may be excluded from separation. In addition, the removing of MNPs from cell surface can remain challenging, and may damage cells. Indeed, the detachment process can involve saturated protein solutions, enzymes able to cleave beads form the cells, temperature induced method, which are either not efficient for all cells or may diminish cell viability.\nµMacs implementing a single external permanent magnet are reported [137– 142]. Their interest is to release trapped particles when removing the magnet. However, low magnetophoretic forces are reached due to magnet size and the large distance between the magnetic field gradient and the target objects in the channel. For instance, Kang et al. [139] and Wang et al. [142] proposed two different systems both based on the entrapment of labeled CTCs in a flow where both CTCs and blood cells are present. In presence of the magnetic field gradient, labeled cells were deviated towards specific compartments, and could then be released by removing the magnet. Oskumur et al. [138], combined size based filtration assay, inertial focusing and immuno-magnetic assay for efficient capture of both EpCAM positive and EpCAM negative cancer cells. In a first step, separation of WBCs and CTCs from RBCs and platelets was achieved using deterministic lateral displacement. In a second step, alignment of cells in the micro-channel was obtained using inertial focusing, and finally magnetically labeled cells, either CTCs, or WBCs, were deflected into a collection channel using magnetophoretic forces. The inertial focusing strategy, permitted to obtain the alignment of cells in a near single line, in order to prevent cellular collisions during magnetophoresis and to precisely control their position in the main channel in order to deflect them using minimal magnetic force.\n7 Magnetophoresis in Bio-Devices 351\nMicrosystems integrating an array of millimeter size permanent magnets are also reported [143, 144]. Multiple magnetic field gradients can then be achieved directly in the channel while still allowing the release of trapped particles by removing magnets. For instance, Lee et al. [143] developed a µ-MixMACS chip for CTC isolation using negative selection. It consisted in a mixing module for effective binding between WBCs and MNPs coated with CD45 Ab and a magnetic-activated cell sorting module to capture WBCs inside the channel. This resulted in the depletion of magnetically labeled WBCs. In contrast, CTCs kept flowing in the channel and were recovered in the outlet. As schematically showed in Fig. 7.23a, the bio-device was composed of three superposed channels: a micromixer, an incubation chamber and an enrichment channel. The magnet array comprised 21 NdFeB pieces. They were arrayed in a laser-cut plastic cartridge with 2 mm gap between adjacent magnets with alternating polarity. The authors compared the separation efficiency obtained in their device with a commercially available kit, EasySepTM Human CD45 Depletion Kit. They reported better CTCs recovery rate in their microsystem.\nIntegrated arrays of permanent micron-size magnets were also reported for cell manipulation [44, 145]. They presented the advantage to achieve higher forces thanks to magnet down-scaled down to cell size. However, releasing of trapped cells remains challenging so this approach is more adapted for in channel observation or treatment of cells.\nMicro-concentrators of magnetic flux were also largely employed for labeled cells sorting in bio-device, and various methods are reported in literature [135, 146– 148]. Ferromagnetic thin film approach is reported in Esmaeilsabzali et al. [146] publication. They proposed a system for detection and isolation of prostate cancer cells from blood. This system featured large trapping surface consisting in V-shaped Permalloy ferromagnetic micro-traps as shown in Fig. 7.23b.\nThe sample continuously flowed through the channels and labeled cells were deviated towards magnetic microtraps. In order to display magnetophoretic force in the whole channel thickness, thick approaches were also reported. For instance, Malik et al. [135], presented a 3D polymer –based microchip for immuno-magnetic capture and release of Listeria monocytogenes. Their device was made of cyclo olefin copolymer (COC) and contained an array of 3D micro-pillars (diameter of 20 µm; height of 67 µm) coated with a layer of nickel. A picture of the bio-device highlighting the integrated pillars, and a schematic of principle are shown in Fig. 7.23c. The fabrication process involving hot-embossing and electroless deposition is compatible with mass-production. In addition, they designed their system in a way that the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the flow in order to facilitate the release of particles when the magnetic field is removed. It comprised a wide capture chamber, containing the pillars, to process large volumes. Faivre et al. [67] developed an elegant approach based in composite polymer for labeled cell manipulation. They proposed a trapping device using thick composite iron-PDMS (I-PDMS) microstructures to generate large magnetic field gradient. Saliba et al. [148] developed an original method, consisting in an array of column of self-assembled bio-functionnalized superparamagnetic particles, on which target\n352 A.-L. Deman and D. Le Roy\ncells are trapped through Ag-Ab recognition. The substrate was patterned by microcontact printing in order to locally deposit water-based ferrofluid onto glass. These ferromagnetic dots acted as micro-concentrator of magnetic flux in order to assemble magnetic particles in columns. Then, these magnetic particles were functionalized and, via Ag-Ab interaction, cells were trapped on the columns.\n7 Magnetophoresis in Bio-Devices 353"

      "text" : "Associating magnetism to microfluidics permit to address numerous challenges for biomedical applications. This combination permit precise manipulation of functionalized micro-particles or biological entities such as magnetically labeled cells or natively paramagnetic RBCs. Indeed, micro- and nano-objects exposed to a non– uniform magnetic field undergo a translational magnetic force referred as magnetophoresis. This force depends on the magnetic nature of the target object and can be greatly increased by integrating micro-sources of magnetic flux directly inside of microfluidic channel. Thus, the magnetic force can predominate, in this environment, over other forces such as drag or gravitational forces. The precise balance of these forces allows describing the motion of target objects and to manipulate them. The implementation of magnetophoretic functions in bio-device are mainly performed using permanent micro-magnet or micro-concentrators of magnetic flux. Both options can lead to comparable maximum force intensities for any given target objects. Permanent micro-magnets do not require any exterior flux to operate, which permits to develop devices with incomparable compactness, but in turns are bound to remain active, with fixed force strength. In contrast, the micro-concentrators of magnetic flux offer easy and real time modulation of the generated force, allowing releasing the trapped object when required. Concerning bio-analysis, magnetic particles present the advantage of versatility in their functionalization. They can thus serve to develop various detection routes, like for nucleic acid and proteins, or for labeling diamagnetic cells, which was notably exploited for blood fractionation, CTCs trapping and sorting. As they do not set restrictions on the target objects, magnetophoretic forces can be easily associated to other forces, dielectrophoresis for instance [149], to improve their separation efficiency."
