In this investigation the impact of π-π interaction on nanoaggregates of cationic amphiphile viz., cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) in contrast with the cation-π interaction in cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in the presence of surface-active aromatic π conjugated hydroxy aromatic derivatives of naphthalene viz., 1 Naphthol, 2 Naphthol and 2,3 Dihydroxynaphthalene is reported. The presence of π-π interaction in CPB enables stronger synergism between the hydroxynaphthalenes compared to the non-aromatic analogue CTAB while face-to-face stacking interaction in CPB-hydroxynaphthalene systems lead to formation of worm like micelle (WLM) with relatively short entanglement lengths as compared to that in CTAB.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "The π-π interactions arise from weak but oriented forces between adjacent delocalized π systems (usually aromatic rings). Known variously as “π – π stacking,” or “charge-transfer” interactions they play a role in membrane structure, [1] stabilization of the double helical structure of DNA via vertical base-base interactions, [2,3] the intercalation of drugs into DNA, [4] the crystal packing of aromatic molecules, [5] the tertiary structures of proteins, [6] recognition of site motifs in enzyme etc. [7] Aromatic amino acids especially tryptophan can bind with nucleic bases via π - π stacking interaction [8]. These interactions have been previously studied via ab initio calculations [9,10]. The various levels of theories and basis sets were carefully chosen to calculate the interaction energies of aromatic (π - π) and stacking types of interactions that are responsible for important biological phenomenon such as the stabilization of double helical DNA [11]. The preferred stacking interactions of benzene dimers with emphasize on dipole-dipole and quadrupole-quadrupole interaction have been carried computationally [12]. Martinez et al. implied that direct electrostatic interactions between polarized atoms of substituents as well as solvation/desolvation\neffects in strongly interacting solvents contribute towards the π – π interaction [10]. Hunter and Sanders have shown that π – π interactions are not due to an attractive electronic interaction between the two πsystems but occur when the attractive interactions between πelectrons and the α-framework outweigh unfavorable contributions such as π-electron repulsion [7]. The π electron density on most aromatic rings creates a quadrupole moment with partial negative charge above both aromatic faces and a partial positive charge around the periphery. Two such quadrupole moments in proximity should eschew face-centered parallel stacking in favor of perpendicular edge-to-face interactions or off-centered parallel stacking. A thorough reading of the experimental and theoretical literature in a variety of fields reveals a noticeable lack of predominant face centered stacking and, therefore, no preference for interacting π clouds among associated aromatic molecules normally encountered in synthetic and biological systems. Instead, consideration of π system polarization, as described by Hunter and Sanders, has provided a qualitative starting point for predicting the observed T-shaped or offset-stacked geometries that are observed almost exclusively with most aromatics [7,10].\nOn the other hand, cation-π interaction is another energetically significant non-covalent interactions which stabilize protein structures, [13] play important role in biological recognition such as binding of nicotinic acetylcholine, a prominent neurotransmitter [14–16]. Interests in\nthe morphology transitions in presence of organic π-conjugated systems stem from the biological relevance of cation-π interaction and the fact that the self-assembled aggregates of surfactants viz., micelles, vesicles etc. are considered as simplemodels of biologicalmembrane including cell membranes. Furthermore, in structural biology, the importance of quaternary ammonium ion is well recognized. For example, anionic cyclophane is a better receptor for quaternary ammonium and iminium ions in aqueous borate buffer than for corresponding neutral molecules [13]. Some of the strongest support for cation-π interactions at acetylcholine binding sites comes from studies of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) [15]. Even without an X-ray structure, the evidence for a key role for aromatic residues at the ACh-binding site, and hence for the possible involvement of a cation-π interaction, is very strong.\nEarlier, we have shown that the cation-π interaction between the quaternary ammonium group of Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and the phenolic moiety of tyrosineoctyl and tyrosinedodecyl esters dominates the surface curvature in themembranemimickingmicellar systems [17]. In this context, therefore, it is highly crucial to have deeper understanding on the role of “π - π interactions” if any and its manifestation on the membrane interfaces.\nTherefore, in this manuscript, we have attempted to study the influence of the “π - π interactions” in modulating the curvature of spherical cationic micelles (viz., CTAB and Cetylpyridinium bromide, CPB) which are widely studied as simplest models for biological membranes. The amphiphiles CPB (having pyridinium head group) and CTAB (having quaternary ammonium head group) are chosen as these have similar hydrophobic character due to identical alkyl chain length (n = 16). Their interaction with the hydroxynaphthalenes is investigated thoroughly. The hydroxynaphthalenes are chosen since they provide excellent promise of insight into “π - π interactions” due to the presence of extended aromatic ring. Moreover, 1-Naphthol, 2-Naphthol and 2,3- Dihydroxynaphthalenes have been known to efficientlymodify the surface curvature of cationic micelles [18]. Therefore, the study warrants deeper insight on the nature of the non-covalent interactions i.e., cation-π or π-π."

      "text" : "Ionic amphiphiles display an abrupt change in slope of the specific conductance vs. concentration curve which marks the critical concentration for micelle formation [21]. The conductometric profile of the aromatic amphiphile CPB in presence of aromatic hydroxyl naphthalenes viz., 1 Naphthol, 2 Naphthol and 2,3 Dihydroxynaphthalene, reveal that the aggregation of the cationic surfactant monomers with aromatic headgroup i.e., CPB, into spherical micelles is facilitated by the addition of the hydroxy naphthalenes (Fig. 1). Simultaneous investigation of aggregation behavior of cationic surfactant with non-aromatic headgroup i.e. CTAB as control, in presence of hydroxy naphthalenes is carried out. Results show thatwhile the criticalmicelle concentration (CMC) of both CPB and CTAB are reduced in presence of hydroxy naphthalenes from its parent value (Fig. 1), interestingly, the extent of reduction in CMC value for aromatic, CPB, is much higher compared to non-aromatic, CTAB in presence of identical amount aromatic hydrotropes (naphthalenederivatives) (Fig. 1).\nWe quantified the percentage of decrease in CMC values which turned out to be 54% decrease in CPB and 38% in CTAB in presence of 1 mM 1 Naphthol. We observed a similar decrease in CMC values (i.e. 54% for CPB and 40% for CTAB) in presence of 1 mM 2 Naphthol while 1 mM 2, 3 DHN reduced the CMC values at a lesser extent (i.e. 43.8% for CPB and 33.7% for CTAB). Even though both themonohydroxy naphthalenes have nearly identical influence on facilitating the aggregation behavior of CPB and CTABmicelles, themicellar aggregation is much facilitated for aromatic CPB compared to CTAB. At this stage, we cannot underpin any concrete reason for this differential behavior of CPB in presence of naphthalenes. We hypothesize that aromatic π-stacking interaction in between pyridinium headgroup of CPB and naphthalene ring could be the driving force for such synergistic lowering in CMC values in particular for CPB-naphthalene blends.\nPreviously, pH dependent study reported that at lowphenol concentration (0.5 mM, 1.0 mM), phenol-CPC system could be solubilized at the micelle-water interface driven by the polar interaction between the phenolate ion (C6H6O−) and the pyridinium head group (C5H5N+) [22]. At higher phenol concentration (>2 mM), upon saturation of the micelle-water interface, C6H6O− intercalate deeper into the palisade layer of themicelles [22]. It is noteworthy that under the present experimental pH range 6.8–7.2, the hydroxynaphthalenes remain predominantly in the non-protonated form (viz., (pKa)1 Naphthol = 9.34, (pKa)2 Naphthol = 9.51, (pKa) 2,3-DHN = 9.10). Therefore, the strong synergism between the cationic surfactants and the naphthalene derivatives at low concentration (<1mM), is resulted by the presence of the extended conjugation in the hydroxy naphthalenemolecules which facilitates the cation-π interaction to a larger extent compared to that in phenol. [18]\nTo obtain the composition of maximum interaction of the hydroxynaphthalenes with the cationic surfactant, the cmc of the mixed systems are measured as function of different surfactant: hydroxynaphthalene molar ratios (Fig. 2).\nIt may be seen that for both CPB and CTAB, the minimum value of cmc is obtained at equimolar composition of the surfactant and the respective hydroxynaphthalenes. Theoretical calculations based on regular solution theory [23] showed a similar cmc-concentration profile for mixtures of ionic and non-ionic surfactants with similar head group sizes [24]. The synergistic interaction observed between CPB or CTAB head groups and the hydroxynaphthalenes is primarily due to electrostatic interaction governed by entropy of mixing of the surfactant and hydroxynaphthalene molecules with the solvent as well as among themselves [24]. Self-interaction between the surfactants becomes predominant at higher surfactant compositions and over-rules the synergism between surfactant and the hydroxynaphthalene resulting in the observed hike in cmc values beyond equimolar composition. [18,25]\nFor quantitative insight on the strength and nature of interaction between the two components of the mixed systems, the interaction parameter, β, is calculated, based on the regular solution theory (RST) [26]. The mathematical details can be found elsewhere [17]. The\nhydroxynaphthalenes are reported to be surface active with welldefined critical aggregation values [18]. Therefore the systems in the present study are treated as mixed surfactant systems wherein the interaction between the head groups of the surfactant components are evaluated (Table 1). The negative values of β for all the surfactanthydroxynaphthalene systems confirm the attractive nature of the head group interaction. [27] Higher β values are observed for all compositions in CPB systems compared to that in CTAB which quantify stronger interaction of the aromatic naphthalenemoietywith the pyridinium head group of CPB compared to that with the quarternary ammonium group of CTAB [28]. Furthermore, among all the systems, the extent of electrostatic interaction is the highest in between CPB and 2,3 DHN. The systems exhibitmaximum β value at or near the equimolar composition (except for CTAB-2,3 DHN and CPB-2 Naphthol system) suggesting most of an entropically favored composition."

      "text" : "1H NMR is one of themost important tool to identify π- π or cation-π interactions in surfactants. [29–31] The mutual orientation of solubilized hydroxynaphthalene within the surfactant micelles is studied via 1H NMR spectroscopy. The molecular architecture of the hydroxynaphthalene viz., 1 Naphthol, 2 Naphthol and 2,3 DHN are similar, differing only in the position of the OH functionality in the aromatic ring. The exchangeable hydroxy proton, do not provide reliable signals, therefore, the study is focused on determining the mutual location of the aromatic naphthalene ring with respect to the surfactant molecules. Since optimum interaction between the surfactant and hydroxynaphthalenes are obtained at equimolar composition, a 10 mM: 10 mM system solution in D2O is prepared for the NMR study. The concentrations of both surfactants and the hydroxynaphthalenes are above their respective critical aggregation concentration, therefore contributions from the monomers are neglected. The 1H NMR spectra of CPB-2-Naphthol mixed system along with the respective proton\nalene systems at different mole ratio, at 303 K.\nnumbering, are presented in Fig. 3. The aromatic resonances for the pyridinium moiety of CPB in D2O resonate between 8 and 9 ppm, [22] whereas in the CPB-2 Naphthol system (Fig. 3),merged broad peaks appearwithin 7.04 ppm to 8.83 ppm. The overall significant upfield shift of the CPB protons and the 2-Naphthol (Fig. S1) protons imply strong interaction between the aromatic head group including strong π-π interaction in between [29].\nThe spectral line width of the aliphatic proton signals of CPB in the CPB-2 Naphthol mixed system is high, and appears as multiplets, because of which specific assignment of proton resonances becomes less straightforward in this case. Thereafter 2D NMR is employed for further insight on the molecular interactions."

      "heading" : "3.2.2. NOESY",
      "text" : "Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) is a 2D NMR technique which presents correlation via dipolar interaction, between protons which are closer than 5 Å in space [32]. The intensity of NOESY cross-peaks provides a directmeasure of extent of magnetization transfer and the internuclear distance between the protons [33]. The NOESY spectrum of (10 mM) CPB and (10 mM) 2 Naphthol shows several cross-peaks as presented in Fig. 4.\nThe cross-peaks indicating correlation between the aromatic protons of both 2Naphthol (N1-N7) and CPB (T1-T3)with theαmethylene protons of CPB (T4) are evident (Fig. 4). Contrary to that observed in the case of CTAB (Fig. S3), intensity of the N1-N7/T4 cross-peak is\nsignificantly less, which suggests a greater distance between the T4 and N1-N7 protons. [34] Interestingly, the second set of key crosspeaks indicating interaction between the alkyl and terminal protons with the naphthalene as well as pyridinium moiety, is apparent (Highlighted in box (c)), although intensity corresponding to interaction with 2 Naphthol is relatively low. The CPB is essentially an electron deficient aromatic systemwith a positively charged nucleus surrounded by delocalized π-electron cloud, while 2 Naphthol is a neutral electron rich aromatic system with extended π-electron conjugation. The electrostatic complementarity between 2 Naphthol and the CPB head group lead to strong face-to-face stacking which screen the head group charge of the CPBmolecule favoring micellization [35]. The interfacial hydrogen bonded –OHof 2-Naphthol alongwith the π- π stacking interaction leads to greater separation between the aromatic naphthol protons and the aliphatic CPB proton (T4) or lessermicellar penetration, which ismanifested in low intensity of the corresponding 2Dcrosspeaks (Fig. 4).\nOwing to the planar geometry of the pyridinium moiety, the effective head group area of CPB is significantly lesser than its quarternary ammonium analogue CTAB, where the bulky methyl groups gives rise to steric congestion. The absence of steric congestion in CPBmay be another contributing factor towards the enhanced interaction at the interface observed between the Naphthol derivatives and CPB head groups. Whereas, deeper penetration of the same in CTAB micelles may be driven by the compensation of electrostatic as well as steric repulsion\nB and 10 mM 2 Naphthol in D2O, at 298 K.\nby the cation-π interaction between the quarternary ammonium moiety and the π electron cloud of the naphthol derivatives [36].\nThe origin of the observed interactions in NOESY spectramay be further explored by considering the different forces operating within the systems. Theπ-π interactions result if the attractive interaction between π-electron and α-framework predominates over the repulsive interaction between two π-electron systems. The quadrupole moment of the π-electron density favors off-centered or edge to face perpendicular ππ stacking over face-to face stacking to compensate the repulsion of negative charge of the electron cloud above and below the aromatic ring [30]. The screening of electrostatic charge between the head groups of the surfactant monomers by the hydroxynaphthalene moieties reduces in the effective head group area, a0, of the surfactant thereby increasing the packing parameter, P, responsible for aggregate morphology [37].\nP ¼ v ao lc ð1Þ\nwhere ν and lc are the volume and the extended length of the surfactant tail, respectively.

Due to spatial congestion near the endcaps and higher density of the surfactant molecules, intermolecular interaction between the surfactants are likely to be predominant at the end cap which result in corresponding selfinteraction cross-peaks observed in the NOESY spectrum (Fig. 4).\nTo confirm themicellar shape transition from spherical to ellipsoidal or worm like as suggested by the 2D NOESY study, small angle neutron scattering analyses of the mixed systems are carried."

The SANS profile of the surfactant - hydroxynaphthalene in deuterated aqueous media are provided in Fig. 5.\nThe SANS spectra of the surfactant in the presence of the hydroxynaphthalenes show a rise in the low Q region, while scattering in the high Q region is independent of the surfactant type and is nearly identical for CPB and CTAB in case of all the hydroxynaphthalenes (Fig. 5).

Solid circles represent\nshow a characteristic correlation peak at the intermediate Q region, signifying the presence of inter-particle electrostatic interaction [42]. In presence of 1 Naphthol, no correlation peak is evident in either CPB or CTAB (Fig. 5 (a)) which demonstrates that the electrostatic repulsion between the charged head groups of CPB as well as that of CTAB is efficiently reduced by 1 Naphthol [41]. The higher rise in intensity at the low Q region for the CTAB compared to CPB, for all the three hydroxynaphthalenes, signify larger extent of micellar growth in the non-aromatic CTAB analogue compared to that in the aromatic counterpart CPB [42]. The distinct correlation peak in CPB-2-naphthol, however, shows that electrostatic repulsion is dominant in this system. In presence of 2,3 DHN, the correlation peak is evident for both CPB and CTAB (Fig. 5(c)). The peak appear at higher Q value for CPB-2,3-DHN compared to CPB-2 Naphthol system. In general, the correlation peak occur at Q≈ 2π/d, where d is the average distance between the aggregates present in the sample [42]. Thus, the observation imply a decrease in correlation length in the surfactant-2,3 DHN systems, ξ, given by ξ= 2π/Qmax [41,43] The nearly identical Qmax for CPB and CTAB (Fig. 5(c)) further reveal similar aggregate density in both the systems. The SANS data are fitted to the prolate ellipsoid micellar model and found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental curves (Solid lines in Fig. 5). This confirms the structural modification of the spherical micelles of both CPB and CTAB is mediated by the hydroxy aromatic derivatives [44]. Table 2 summarizes the structural dimension of the surfactant- hydroxynaphthalene systems obtained on fitting the experimental data to prolate ellipsoidal micellar model.\nIt is evident that the present aggregates are not spherical but rather rod like, comprising of small worms having length about five times that of the radius. Shorter worms are formed in CPB systems compared to the CTAB analogues. Due to the face to face π – π interactions, the head group cationic repulsion is screened to a lesser extent in CPB which is also manifested in the presence of a distinct correlation peak (Fig. 5(b)), and consequently results in the observed shorter micelles [29]. On the contrary, absence of stacking interaction cause the hydroxynaphthalene moiety to embed deeper in between the nonaromatic cationic head group of CTAB. This significantly reduces the electrostatic repulsion, such that the aggregates adopt a linear interfacial curvature and results in longer WLMs in order to compensate the end cap energy."

Fig. 6 presents a representative plot of the variation of Gˊ and G˝with angular frequency, ω, for the CPB-2 Naphthol system at 328 K.\nSimilar nature of the elastic and loss modulus is observed for the surfactant-hydroxynaphthalene mixed systems, at all the temperatures studied (Fig. S4). The response profile of Gˊ and G˝ as function of ω and the Cole-Cole plots confirm the viscoelastic nature of the surfactanthydroxynaphthalene systems [41,46,47].\nPredominantly viscous and consequent elastic nature is observed at lowωwhere G″>G′while at highω, G′>G″. Beyond a cross over point, ωc, i.e., Gˊ = G˝, the system gains fluidity. With rise in temperature, the frequency spectra shift to the right, exhibiting higherωc. A higher value of ωc imply lower relaxation time, τR, as τR ¼ 1=ωc [48]. The variation of τR as function of temperature shows that thewormlikemicellar systems of CPB relaxes relatively faster than the CTAB counterparts (i.e., at lower values of τR).\nThe network mesh size of the entangled wormlike micelles is characterized by ξ the hydrodynamic correlation length.

The ratio Lavg, /le defines the average number of entanglements per micelle.\nTable 3 summarizes the parameters obtained from rheological study of the surfactant-hydrotope systems.\nIt is evident that in all the cases, τbr≪τRep, which characterizes all the systems with a single relaxation time i.e., they exhibit Maxwellian behavior in the concerned temperature range.\nTable 3 shows that the τRep of CPB-2 Naphthol relaxes slower i.e., τRep varies from~976 s to 3 s while in case of CTAB-2 Naphthol system τRep varies from ~284 s to 0.38 s in the same temperature range i.e., 313–333 K. However, much faster relaxation is observed in CPB2,3 DHN system where τRep varies within ~47 s to 3 s compared to~1486 s to 100 s in the case of CTAB-2,3 DHN system, for a temperature jump of 5 K from 328 K to 333 K. A higher value of τRep is indicative of slower relaxation, which is associated with linearity of the micellar framework [51]. The observation indicates that the aromatic surfactant system CPB form wormlike micelle with shorter entanglement length compared to the non-aromatic surfactant system CTAB. Furthermore,\n1Naphthol shows the preference to form longermicelleswith CPB compared to CTAB as evident from the higher values of τRep in case of CPB (Table 3).\nThe flow activation energy, EA, which describes the end-cap energy and the energy required for reversible micellar scission and is regarded as a measure of the “compactness” or “slowness” of the WLM flow has been evaluated as: [50,51].\nτR ¼ A exp EA R T ð5Þ or,\nlogτR ¼ logAþ EA R T ð6Þ where A is the pre-exponential factor and is a constant, R is the universal gas constant taken as 8.314 J·mol−1·K−1 and T is the temperature.\nArrhenius' semilog plot of τR v/s temperature shows a straight line (Fig. 8) implying a single exponential decrease in relaxation time with temperature, another manifestation of Maxwell nature. [43]\nThe flow activation energy for all the systems obtained from Eq. (6), are summarized in Table 4.\nIt is evident from Table 4 that the wormlike micelles of CPBhydroxynaphthalene systems possess a more flow activation energy compared to corresponding CTAB-hydroxynaphthalene systems. This demonstrates more compact micelles formed in the CPB systems in comparison to CTAB. [52] The compact nature of the WLM of CPB in comparison to CTAB in the presence of the hydroxynaphthalene derivatives further corroborates the strong π- π interactions within the system. A recent study of solid state interaction of polystyrene (PS) on modified phenyltrimethoxysilane (PTS) interface reported stable π- π interactions in parallel displaced conformation of the aromaticmoieties, acting as the major driving force to orient phenolic moiety of PS at the PTS interface and impart thermal stability to the system [53]. Furthermore, sum frequency generation study revealed that an increase in number of π electrons on aromatic modified substrates leads to marked rise in the interfacial π-π interaction between the same and PSwhile offering greater thermal stabilization to the system [54]. In the present system we observe substantial increase in the interaction between the naphthalene head groups and the pyridinium moiety (Section 3.2) compared to that previously reported between phenolic moiety and CPC [22].\nFurthermore, 2 Naphthol is found to bemore efficient compared to 1 Naphthol in reducing the respective cmcs of CPB while 2,3 DHN appear most efficient (Section 3.1). The observed difference in the behavior of the naphthol derivatives arise from the different positioning of the hydroxy functionality. Theβ orientation of the -OH group of 2Naphthol facilitates in positioning of the naphthol moieties in between the CPB micelles forming favorable hydrogen bond with the interfacial water molecules leading to a greater extent of π-π interaction compared to\nand 100 mM CTAB in presence of (a) 100 mM 1 Naphthol, (b) 100 mM 2 Naphthol and\nthe 1-Naphthol, where anchoring of the hydroxymoiety lead to slightly oblique orientation of the same resulting in relatively less favorable non-covalent interaction [55]. The same is reflected in higher entanglement length of CPB with 2 Naphthol (Table 3) compared to that with 1 Naphthol and consequently relatively higher flow activation energies (Table 4) and more compact nature of the worms of CPB with 2 Naphthol.\nA schematic representation of the proposedmolecular interaction in the representative CTAB-2 Naphthol and CPB-2 Naphthol systems is presented in Scheme 1.\nScheme 1.

      "heading" : "4. Conclusion",
      "text" : "Hereinwe report the synergistic modification of the aggregation behavior of cationic surfactants CPB and CTAB in presence of hydroxy aromatic compounds 1 Naphthol, 2 Naphthol and 2,3 DHN. Substantial drop in cmc's of both CPB as well as CTAB is observed as consequence of reduced electrostatic repulsion between the surfactant headgroups caused by the π-electrons of hydroxynaphthalenes. CPB exhibit a greater decrease in cmc compared to CTAB. 1H and 2D NMR study revealed that the hydroxynaphthalenes reside at the palisade layer of the CPB micelles while these intercalate relatively deeper towards the micellar core in the case of non-aromatic analogue. Hydrogen bonding between the OH of the aromaticmoieties and the interfacial water molecules in addition to the cation - π and π - π interactions facilitate this favorable orientation of the aromatic compounds within the surfactant micelles. Morphology transition of the surfactant micelles from spherical to linear or worm like is triggered by the neutral hydroxynaphthalenes in absence of counterions, at high concentration regime (200mM),which impart temperature dependent highly tunable viscoelasticity to the medium. The wormlike micellar systems of CPB dominated by less observed face to face π – π stacking interactions are\nin (a) CPB-2 Naphthol system and (b) CTAB-2 Naphthol system\nfound to be more compact with higher flow energy and longer entanglement length (in presence of 1-Naphthol and 2-Naphthol) compared to the wormlike micelles in CTAB with predominant cation – π interaction. The results bear potential application prospects of π – π interaction with controlled design and application towards fine tuning themolecular interaction using specificity of hydroxynaphthalene in triggering formation of higher order aggregates of desired length scale and properties.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nGulmi Chakraborty: Methodology, Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Formal analysis.
