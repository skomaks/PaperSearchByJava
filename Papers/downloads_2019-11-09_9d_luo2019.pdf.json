However, due to the high volatility and fast catabolism of H2S, traditional H2S detection methods are confronted with great challenges. Fortunately, the development of optical nanotechnology sheds new light on the real-time and sensitive detection of intracellular or subcellular H2S. Nanomaterials emerged as potential candidates for the optical detection of biomolecule analytes due to their excellent properties, such as easy preparation and modification, tunable optical characteristics and high photostability. Recently, many probes based on nanomaterials, ranging from inorganic nanostructures to organic polymers, have been demonstrated to exhibit high sensitive and selective detection toward H2S both in vitro and in vivo. Different from the previous review articles, we mainly summarize the advancements of optical probes, including fluorescence and non-fluorescence probes, for endogenous H2S detection based on nanomaterials in recent five years.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

      "text" : "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is environmentally poisonous gas with rotten eggs smells and its level in the air has beenmonitored rigidly [1,2]. When it comes to biosystem, the endogenously produced H2S in mammalian cells becomes a kind of important gas signaling molecule and is found to be involved in a variety of physiological processes [3,4]. For example, H2S acts as an antioxidant in the liver and lung tissue and a vasodilator for cardioprotection [5e7]. Much research has verified that H2S plays more biological roles, including anti-inflammation, angiogenesis, neuromodulation and etc. [3] The multiple biological roles of H2S mean that they also participate in many pathological activities. The abnormal level of H2S in vivo induces various diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) [8], Down's syndrome [9], Parkinson's disease [10] and diabetes [11]. With the more aware of H2S in living biosystems, its potential in treating diseases has also been explored [12].\nIn mammalian systems, the production of endogenous H2S is mainly regulated through an enzymic pathway by three kinds of enzymes [13], namely, cystathionine g-lyase (CSE), cystathionine bsynthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST). The enzymic interconversions of sulfur-containing substrates contribute to producing H2S and the level of H2S varies within different organs and tissues. For example, the catabolism rate of intracellular H2S is very fast and varies with the different signaling process, inducing that the concentration of H2S possibly changes from few nanomolar to sub-millimolar in a short time [14]. Additionally, the complicated environment in vivo reinforces the difficulty in H2S detection. Thus, it is urgently desired to achieve real-time and local monitoring toward H2S in vivo, with high sensitivity and selectivity.\nTraditional methods such as gas chromatography [15] and electrochemical analysis [16e18] provide an extremely high precision for H2S assay, but they are denounced to be sampledestructive. Noninvasive detection approaches that are free of infiltrating or destroying healthy tissue are in demand to be explored. With the booming of molecular imaging, noninvasive optical probes especially for fluorescence probes, have become the current state-of-the-art approach to fulfill the real-timemonitoring of H2S level with high spatial resolutions in biosystems [19,20].\nCompared with the probes based on small molecules, nanoprobes for H2S detection exhibit more advantages. i) The current small molecular probes are limited to the field of fluorescence imaging [4,21e23], while nanoprobes offer versatile imaging modes such as photoacoustic tomography and scattering dark field imaging by virtue of the special properties of nanomaterials. ii) Nanoprobes have addressed the problems like poor solubility and photostability that most small molecular probes suffer from and expand their application in physiological fluid. iii) Nanomaterials such as upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) can result in fluorescence emission of fluorophores red-shift to a near-infrared region (NIR). iv) Nanoprobes are more likely to proceed a kinetic mapping in vivo due to the unique and tunable optical properties of nanomaterials. In the past decades, nanomaterial-based H2S probes have made great progress with the development of novel materials and the advancement of optical imaging techniques. However, as far as we know, a systematic introduction of the nanoprobes for H2S detection in biosystems has not been reviewed yet. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent five-year-progress in the nanomaterials-based H2S optical nanoprobes, including fluorescence imaging and non-fluorescence imaging, and the bioimaging of small molecules will not be discussed. The challenges and some thoughts on future perspectives for the design of H2S nanoprobes are also addressed."

H2S-involved reduction of azides, nucleophilic addition and metal-sulfide precipitation are the major chemical reactions used in fluorescence turn-on probes."

      "heading" : "2.1.1. Azide reduction",
      "text" : "Since Chang's group first reported the fluorescence switch-on probe for H2S detection by reduction of azides to amines [25], numerous small molecule fluorescence probes containing azide moieties have been designed by other researchers. Recently, the azide moiety was also incorporated with nanoparticles by direct or indirect methods to develop H2S-responsive nanoprobes. For example, Wu's group reported an azide-modified polymeric fluorescent sensor polystyrene-co-poly(2-allyl-1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-6-sulfonyl azide) (PSAISA) for H2S detection [26]. Due to the H2S-mediate reduction of azide to amine, PSAISA spherical particles underwent a fluorescence recovery at the wavelength of 530 nm. The PSAISA probes exhibited good selectivity toward H2S and a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.5 mM. To obtain a low LOD, many indirect azide-modified works were reported by coupling fluorophores containing azides with nanoparticles. Kim's group designed an H2S-responsive fluorogenic nanoreactor (nanoABR) by the co-assembly of amphiphilic lipid 1-iodooctadecane, DSPE-PEG (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine)-N-methoxy(polyethylene glycol) and azidobenzylresorufin (ABR) (Fig. 1A) [27]. The nanoreactor strategy provides the possibility to apply the hydrophobic molecular probe in an aqueous environment without chemical modification by encapsulating them into the inner core of nanoreactors. Furthermore, the H2S-responsive signal can be amplified greatly due to the high density of the molecular probes in a localized site. NanoABR gave a notably detectable signal along with a change of solution color within 1min when exposed to H2S, and had a low LOD of 18 nM (Fig. 1B). They also found that the photostability of\nH2S-mediated recovered fluorescence of nanoABR was better than the free resorufin, possibly due to the oxygen-shielding of nanoparticle encapsulation protecting the retention of the recovered resorufin. Additionally, the nanoABR had sensitive fluorogenic responses to the endogenous H2S both in living cells and the serum from diabetic mice and normal mice (Fig. 1C and D).\nUnfortunately, most fluorescence probes suffer from a selfquenching of fluorescence, also named aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ), due to the small Stock shift induced selfabsorption, which largely limits their biomedical applications. Tang's group found an abnormal “aggregation-induced emission” (AIE) phenomenon that some organic luminophores with freelyrotating groups had strong fluorescence emission at a high concentration or at a solid state [28]. AIE mechanism has been expanded to the assays of biological analysts due to their various advantages, such as large Stock shift, high emission in aggregation state and excellent photostability [29]. To reduce the self-absorption effect and enhance the detection S/N ratio, Gao and Chen et al. demonstrated the monitoring of endogenous H2S in lysosomes by AIE dots (AIED) [30]. The AIED was obtained by a simple co-precipitation of amphiphilic block copolymers and azide-modified AIE dyes. The copolymers not only protected the photostability of AIE dyes but also distinguished H2S fromothermolecules containing thiol. Due to the intramolecular photo-induced electron transfer (PET) effect, AIED showed weak fluorescence. With the reduction of azides by H2S, AIED generated a Stock shift of 150 nm and had an increased red fluorescence emission. The colocalization of AIED and Lysoltrack of Hela cells verified the trap of AIED in lysosomes and AIED exhibited selective visualization of endogenous H2S stimulated by addition of L-cysteine."

By attaching (2,4-dinitrophenoxy)tyrosine (DNPTYR) with a strong ability of electron-withdrawing to GQDs, the PL of GQDs can be significantly quenched due to the PET effect between DNPTYR and GQDs. The H2S-mediated aryl nitro thiolysis cleaved the dinitrophenoxy ester in DNPTYR and disrupted the PET system, which induced the PL recovery of GQDs. This GQDs-DNPTYR nanoprobe exhibited a better selectivity toward H2S than other free thiols and anions and achieved an ultra-low LOD of 2 nM. Compared with the small molecule fluorophores, GQDs exhibited some advantages, such as easy preparation and modification, as well as good solubility and photostability. Additionally, nucleophilic reaction based AIE nanoprobes has also been reported. Zeng and Wu et al. designed an AIE nanoprobe by embedding the hydrophobic AIE-active dyes tetraphenylethene (TPE) into the core inner of micelle-like liposomes [33]. With the H2S-mediated cleavage of the 2,4-dinitrophenyl ether moiety, the nanoprobes emitted strong green fluorescence due to the AIE and excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) effect. As expected, this AIE nanoprobe had a large Stock shift of approximately 100 nm, which promoted it promising to track H2S in living cells and in vivo. The tests on the five-day-old zebrafish showed that the nanoprobes emitted bright green fluorescence in the digestive system of the zebrafish in the presence of H2S. Zhang and Chen et al. reported a photoswitchable AIE nanoprobe using AIE-active molecules DNBS-DCM-SP containing photochromic spiropyran moiety for the detection of lysosomal H2S (Fig. 2) [34]. In this work, the electron-withdrawing DNBS moiety was departed from DNBS-DCM-SP by the cleave of\nFig. 2. Photoswitchable AIE nanoprobes for lysosomal H2S detection.

Moreover, the reversible ring-opened reaction of spiropyran induced red-shift fluorescence emission to 650 nm under the UV irradiation (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, the fluorescence intensity of DCM-SP and DCM-MC remained approximately 80% of the original intensity after 6 cycles, indicating that the DNBS-DCM-SP probe had a good photostability. The nanoprobes displayed an excellent sensitivity toward H2S in vitro with a LOD of 5.0 nM and selective dual-color imaging of lysosomal H2S."

      "heading" : "2.1.3. Formation of metal-sulfur bond",
      "text" : "Metal-mediated reaction bridges organic chemistry with material chemistry and proposes a new perspective for the small molecular biological analytes [35]. For example, transition metal ions are robust fluorescence quenchers due to their intrinsic properties, such as unpaired electrons, unfilled electronic orbitals and heavy atom effect [24]. As such, transition metal-ligand substitutions have been developed in the detection and bioimaging of biomolecules, in which metal ions usually act as fluorescence switches to achieve a fluorescence turn-on/off response [36].\nCu2þ has long been used as fluorescence quenchers and triggers the fluorescence turn-on by the formation of CuS precipitations in the design of H2S detection probes because of the ultralow solubility product of CuS (Ksp¼ 8.0 10 36) [37,38]. Taking advantage of the metal displacement strategy, Wang and Tian et al. developed a two-photon (TP) fluorescent sensor for H2S detection based on inorganic-organic nanohybrids of carbon nanodots (C-dots) and N-(2-aminoethyl)-N,N,N0-tris(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)ethane-1,2-\nM-SP for sensing H2S and the reversible dual-fluorescence imaging. B) The fluorescence SP under alternating UV and visible light irradiation. Reproduced with permission from\ndiamine) (AE-TPEA) [39]. In this work, C-Dots acted as TP fluorophores due to their large two-photon absorption cross-section and long-term photostability. AE-TPEA acted as the reaction center of Cu2þ and H2S to control the formation of CuS. The addition of H2S released the fluorescence quench of Cu2þ on C-dots and triggered a TP emission. Compared with the one-photon excitation at 488 nm, the larger excitationwavelength at 800 nm of TP had larger penetration depth without affecting the sensitivity. This TP nanoprobe not only exhibited a good linear response toward H2S in vitro but alsowas able tomonitor the changes of H2S at a depth of 90e150mM in lung cancer tissues under a TP excitation. Our group recently reported a Cu2þ-switching fluorescence nanoprobe based on metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) effect (Fig. 3) [40]. Normally, the intensity of fluorophores diminishes with the close proximity to a metal surface. In contrast, the presence of MEF contributes to an enhanced fluorescence of fluorophores due to the local electromagnetic field between the plasmonic metal and nearby fluorophores. By virtue of the fact that the amplification of signal promotes to a higher S/N ratio, Au NRs were coupled with meso-tetrakis(4-carboxylphenyl)porphyrin) (TCPP) to develop a Au@silica-TCPP-Cu2þ H2S detection probe. By the controlling of the silica shell, the spectra overlap between Au NRs (maximum absorption at 653 nm) and TCPP (emission at 650 nm) achieve a 5-fold enhanced fluorescence of TCPP (Fig. 3A). Cu2þ as the fluorescence switch formed a copper-porphyrin complex with TCPP and turned off the fluorescence of TCPP. With the addition of H2S, Cu2þ disassembled from copper-porphyrin complex and form CuS precipitation with S2 , resulting in the strong fluorescence recovery of TCPP. The Au@silica-TCPP-Cu2þ probe exhibited a good selectivity and sensitivity toward H2S with a LOD of 17 nM (Fig. 3B). The visualization of exogenous and endogenous H2S was further validated in H1299 cells and A549 cells, respectively.\nAgþ is another frequently used transition metal ion in the detection of H2S. Wang and Lin et al. reported an ultrasensitive fluorescence nanoprobe based on carbon quantum dots (CQDs)-Ag NPs composites [41]. According to the density functional theory calculation, the formation of AgeN bonds contributed to a F€orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) system, which induced the fluorescence quench of CQDs. The addition of H2S disrupted the AgeN bonds and turned on the PL of CQDs by forming AgeS bonds, due to the stronger binding capacity of AgeS bonds than AgeN bonds. This CQDs-Ag NPs nanoprobe exhibited a wide linear range from 1 nM to 1.9 mM and a much lower LOD (0.4 nM) than other reported probes. Furthermore, the application potential in vivo of the nanoprobes was evaluated on a rat cerebral calm/ischemia experimental model. The nanoprobes successfully monitored the concentration changes of H2S in the rat brain cortical and ischemia at on the order of micromolar."

      "heading" : "2.2. Fluorescence turn-off",
      "text" : "Fluorescence turn-off is another common strategy for the detection of biomolecules by recording the decrease of the responsive signal [42]. Compare with fluorescence turn-on probes, fluorescence turn-off probes with lower S/N ratio were less popular and usually not designed independently. Chen's group prepared metal-organic coordination polymers (AMP/Tb/Ag) by the selfassembly of Agþ, lanthanide ions Tb3þ and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) [43]. Trivalent lanthanide ions possess many excellent luminescence properties, especially for their large Stock shift and long fluorescence lifetime, which allow them to separate the background signal and avoid the interference from the autofluorescence. However, the luminescence of lanthanide ions is hard to regulate and easily perturbed by small molecules. The authors found that introducing Agþ into the polymers increased the luminescence for approximately 5 times than that of polymers without Agþ. Besides, Agþ also acted as the fluorescence switch for the detection of H2S due to fluorescence turn-off caused by the formation of AgeS bonds. This AMP/Tb/Ag nanoprobe exhibited a linear range of 1e120 mM toward H2S in solution and a linear range of 1e100 mM in serum. Unfortunately, the pH stability results showed that the nanoprobes had a weak emission in pH 4 solution, which restricted their applications in the organelles with the acidic environment such as lysosomes. Considering that the metalcontaining nanoprobes have low solvent thermal stability and the possibility of secondary pollution in living systems, Zeng and Cao et al. substituted the metal-organic polymers with luminescent covalent-organic materials [44]. They synthesized a porous organic polymer nanotube (PNT-1) by two monomers 1,3,5-tris-(3-bromophenyl)- [1,3,5]triazine (TBT) and 2,6-dibromopyridine (2,6-DP). It is worth noting that the luminescence of PNT-1 enhanced significantly due to the increased number of p-p conjugated bonds. In comparisonwith other anions, only S2 induced rapid precipitation and fluorescence turn-off of the PNT-1. The selectivity of PNT-1 toward H2S and other thiols species were not discussed in this work."

      "text" : "Although many of the reported fluorescence turn-on and turnoff probes have obtained low LOD toward H2S, the performance of these probes are easily affected by microenvironments and generate false positive/negative signals. For example, photobleaching or local probe concentration difference of probes in vivo can induce a false responsive signal change. Different from the single wavelength intensity changes of turn-on or turn-off probes, ratiometric fluorescence probes offer an intensity ratio change of\ntwo emission wavelengths [45]. Ratiometric probe for H2S detection becomes an ideal alternative to preclude the aforementioned interferences and achieve high spatiotemporal resolution bioimaging because of their self-calibration effect [46]. FRET is one of the most used mechanisms in the design of ratiometric fluorescence probes, which use the ratio as the detection index to effectively decrease the background interference and deviation of the detection condition."

      "text" : "FRETefficiency determines the sensitivity of the detection signal. Therefore, the reasonable control of the distances between the energy donors and acceptors is an effective approach to improve FRET efficiency. Zhu and co-workers first introduced the concept of the supramolecular nanoprobes for the detection of H2S based on an H2S-triggered FRETswitch [47]. In thiswork, boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) and semi-cyanine-BODIPY hybrid dye BODInD-Clwere set as the energy donor and acceptor, respectively. They were further assembled with amphiphilic copolymer 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-ethanolamine-N-(methoxy(polyethylene glycol)2000)) (mPEG-DSPE) to form a micelle nanostructure (NanoBODIPY). The co-encapsulation of multiple chromophores within the same macromolecule promoted the trapped chromophores in close proximity and thereby contributed to higher FRET efficiency. In the absence of H2S, an effective FRETsystem between BODIPYand BODInD-Cl formed due to the tacit spectral overlap between the donor and acceptor, which induced an emission at 540 nm of NanoBODIPY. Once exposed to H2S, the acceptor BODInD-Cl suffered a nucleophilic attack of H2S and disrupted the FRET of NanoBODIPY, resulting in an emission shift from 540 nm to 738 nm. The remarkable red-shift of approximately ~200 nmaddress the lowS/N ratio limitation of fluorescence turn-off and the NanoBODIPY probes exhibited an ultralow LOD of 7 nM toward H2S. NanoBODIPY probes not only had high sensitivity and selectivity to H2S but also exhibited excellent photostability under the irradiation with a Hg/ Xe lamp, as well as high photostability in a wide pH range of 4.5e8. To endow the H2S probes with a deep tissue penetration for bioimaging, Tan and Zhang et al. reported another ratiometric TP fluorescent nanoprobe TPSNP-1 based on the supramolecular assembly [48]. The TPSNP-1 was able to realize tissue imaging at depths of 80e170 mm by a TP excitation and achieve a noninterfering dual-channel imaging in the presence of H2S. Additionally, the ability of TPSNP-1 to quantitative analysis of H2S in the tissue was performed by evaluating the concentrations of H2S in six kinds of ex vivo-dissected organs, and the results were comparable with H2S commercial kits. They found that the concentrations of H2S in the brain and kidneyweremuch higher than that in the other organs, which certificated that H2S played important role in neuromodulation and CSE could upregulate the generation of H2S."

      "text" : "Considering that the chemical fluorophores possess intrinsic instability at the excited state, UCNPs with unique luminescence property have been exploited as a new generation of promising luminescent probes. As is well-known that UCNPs convert lowenergy light into higher-energy light with a (NIR) excitation, which avoids the possible tissue damages caused by ultraviolet irradiation. The large anti-Stock shift of UCNPs endows them with high photostability and penetration depth, as well as no autofluorescence. FRET-based hybrid systems of UCNPs and H2S-sensitive chromophores have been designed for H2S imaging in vivo. Loo and Zhang et al. first reported a ratiometric UCNPs-CHC1 composites nanoprobes for the intracellular H2S imaging (in which NaYF4 is composed of 20mol% Yb, 1.8mol% Er and 0.5mol% Tm, CHC1 is shorted for coumarin-hemicyanine dye) [49]. The addition\nof H2S induced an absorption blue-shift of CHCl and diminished the FRET efficiency between UCNPs and CHCl (Fig. 4A and B). With the increased concentration of H2S, the fluorescence emission of UCNPs at 541 nm showed an increased linearly proportional to H2S, while the emission at 800 nm almost had no changes, due to no spectral overlap between UCNPs and CHC1 (Fig. 4C). With the extra stimulation of lipopolysaccharide, UCNPs-CHC1 exhibited an enhanced emission intensity of ~87% in the inflammatory liver tissue than that in normal tissues (Fig. 4D). Almost at the same time, Zhao and Huang et al. reported another silica-coated UCNPs-MC hybrids nanoprobe for H2S detection by loading the H2S-sensitive MCs into the silica shell of UCNPs [50]. Very recently, focusing on shortening the H2S-responsive time and broadening the detection linear range, Yuan and Chang et al. synthesized three chromophore compounds and two UCNPs, respectively, to investigate the influence of UCNP donors and chromophore acceptors on the sensing of H2S [51]. They found that the more electronic deficient compound 3-NaYF4:Yb/Er/ Tm nanoprobes had an H2S-responsive time as fast as 5 s in H2S solution and 30 s in a serum sample, as well as a wide linear range of 0e115 mM. Compared to organic downconversion nanoprobes, FRET-based UCNPs nanoprobes show great power in real-time imaging for endogenous H2S in vivo."

Compared with fluorescence, phosphorescence possesses a much longer lifetime, which facilitates to eliminate the interference from short-lived autofluorescence and improve S/N ratios. The intrinsic heavy atom effect of phosphorescent transition-metal complexes endows themwith lifetimes up to the micro- or submicrosecond and allows them to be applied in the bioimaging field [52]. For example, Zhao and Huang et al. synthesized mesoporous silicas containing iridium complex (Ir1) and hybridized them with H2S-responsive dye merocyanine derivatives (Cy2) to produce an H2S nanoprobe Cy2-MSNs/Ir1 [53]. The support of mesoporous silicas allowed Ir1 and Cy2 in close proximity and contributed to a FRETeffect from Ir1 to Cy2. Differing from other ratiometric probes, the Cy2-MSNs/Ir1 nanoprobes presented dual-responsive detection signals toward H2S including the emission lifetime ratio changes and the emission intensity ratio. Interestingly, in another report of phosphorescent probes, the authors recorded the H2S-associated phosphorescence turn-on signal, which was generated by the growth of Mn-doped ZnS QDs, other than the organic molecules chemical reaction [54]. The Mn-doped ZnS QDs nanoprobes exhibited a good selectivity toward H2S in fetal calf serumwith a LOD of 0.2 mM. Although the nanoprobe was not further applied in living biosystems due to the requirements of heavymetal ions, it still proposed a new strategy for the diversity of H2S probe design."

      "text" : "Among the non-fluorescence bioimaging methods, photoacoustic (PA) tomography emerged as a newly potent bioimaging technique because of its significantly optical absorption contrast and high ultrasonic resolution [55]. The development of chemical PA probes proposed new perspective for real-time molecular bioimaging and overcome the depth limitation of traditional optical imaging techniques. Based on their previous research, Zhang's group first presented an H2S-activatable PA nanoprobe by encapsulating semi-cyanine-BODIPY hybrid dyes BODPA into the coreshell silica nanocomposites for the real-time imaging of H2S in\nliving mice [56]. Through the feasible thiol-halogen nucleophilic substitution reaction, H2S activated the Si@BODPA probe to generate a strong (NIR) absorption at 780 nm, which could output a strong photoacoustic signal (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5B, in the presence of H2S, a detectable signal can be obtained as fast as 15 s and the signal intensity was up to 44-fold than that of inactivated state. Taking account of its fast response, high pH stability and selectivity toward H2S, Si@BODPA validated the visualization of endogenous H2S generation in an HCT116 tumor-bearing mouse model (Fig. 5C). However, similar to the single response of fluorescence probes, single responsive PA signal tends to be easily influenced by the environmental conditions and the probe concentrations. In order to eliminate the drawbacks of single responsive PA probes, Xing and Zhang et al. propelled the H2S-activatable PA probe to a ratiometric assay probe with self-calibration [57]. The authors encapsulated the H2S-responsive dye AzHD into the liposomes by the assembly of DSPE-PEG2000-COOH. With the H2Smediated reduction of azide to amine, the absorption of AzHD-LP had a red-shift from 600 nm to 700 nm. By recording the changes of PA signal intensity ratio (PA700/PA532) of AzHD-LP in different concentrations of H2S solution, this nanoprobe was determined to have a LOD of 91 nM toward H2S in vitro. To verify the neuromodulation function of endogenous H2S, both the brains from the normal mice and AD mice were harvested and treated with AzHDLP. The normal group exhibited more than 5-fold enhanced PA signal than that of AD group. Additionally, AzHD-LP was further modified with tumor-targeting ligand RGD and the obtained RGDAzHD-LP showed time-dependent dual-channel PA signal changes in the HCT116 tumor-bearing mice."

Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) associated with noble metal nanostructures offers a label-free approach for biosensing and bioimaging. The LSPR scattering spectrum is highly sensitive to the surrounding medium that easily causes the change of the refractive index [58]. He's group prepared an Au nanorod-Ag core-shell-based nanoprobe for H2S detection, in which Ag shell acted as H2S sensitive sites and Au core acted as the signal reporter [59]. Based on the fact that the spectrum of AueAg NP had a red-shift with the formation of Ag2S, the AueAg nanoprobes achieved an ultrahigh sensitivity towards H2S with a LOD of 0.01 nM and a broad linear range of 0.01 nMe10 mM. Although the formation of Ag2S is irreversible, the spectral shift rate of AueAg NPwas H2S concentrationdependent. According to kinetic spectral analysis, the authors performed highly sensitive mapping for the sulfide and a real-time quantitative assay of H2S in living cells with a single AueAg NP. In comparison with organic fluorophores, plasmonic nanoparticles are easily prepared and possess better photostable and much higher scattering cross-section than that of fluorophores, which contribute to higher detection sensitivity."

      "text" : "Colorimetric analysis is an absorption-based assay and has been used to the monitor H2S in the air for more than 100 years because of its ability to provide a visual detection of H2S with low apparatus requirement [60]. Colorimetric analysis for endogenous H2S detection based on nanomaterials, especially for noble metal nanomaterials such as Au NRs, Cue and Ag NPs, has attracted much attention in the past years due to their tunable LSPR property [61,62]. Lin and co-workers utilized Au NRs to carry out a multicolor colorimetric assay toward H2S by recording the color change of Au NRs caused by etching (Fig. 6) [63]. As is well-known that 3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) can be oxidized to produce TMBþ with blue color in the presence of activated\nhorseradish peroxidase (HRP). Upon addition of acid, TMBþ was further turning into TMB2þ with bright yellow color, which etched Au NRs and induced the absorption blue-shift of Au NRs. The presence of H2S prevented the etching process of Au NRs by deactivating HRP and inhibiting the production of TMB2þ and gave an H2S concentration-dependent color signal response. As shown in Fig. 6B and C, Au NRs in a high H2S concentration solution exhibit a well-defined rod shape, which were comparable to the original Au NRs, along with a slight blue-shift of the absorption. In contrast, they were etched in the absence of H2S with a significant blue-shift of absorption, a company with the color of solution changing to pink. The etching-based assay gave a good detection linear range of 0.05e50 mM with a LOD of 19 nM. Additionally, the local quantification of endogenous H2S was validated by detecting the microdialysate samples from different regions of the mice brain. Cue and Ag-based H2S nanoprobes are easy to be oxidized in the presence of coordination agents, whichmake it limited to carry out a precise detection of H2S in real samples. Taking advantage of the affinity of Ag to sulfide, Yin's group reported an Au/AgI alloy NPs for the selective sensing of H2S. With the transformation of AgI to Ag2S, the plasmonic resonance peak of Au/AgI NPs had a blueshift, resulting in a naked-eye readout color change of the solution from purplish red to blue and light green [64]. By optimizing the size of Au core and the thickness of Ag shell, the H2S linear detection range was maximized to be from 0 to 80 mM, with a LOD of 5 mM and 0.5 mM by naked-eyes readout and UVevis spectrophotometer, respectively. Furthermore, the endogenously generated H2S during the HepG2 cell cultivation was collected by agarose gels, and was determined to be 167 nmol h 1 10 6 cells. However, the colorimetric analysis only provides the sensitive detection of biological H2S in vitro samples and has not been validated in living biosystems so far."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusion and perspective",
      "text" : "The important roles of endogenous H2S in biosystems drive the development of nanoprobes and the progress of nanomaterialbased analysis techniques, in turn, offer the high real-time sensitivity determination of H2S. Due to their diversity and tunable optical properties, nanomaterials-based detection and imaging of H2S have been validated in a variety of optical techniques, such as ultravioletevisible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, photoacoustic tomography and etc. The real-time monitoring of endogenous H2S by optical nanoprobes contributes to better understanding of the H2S function, thereby preventing from the occurrence of diseases and further seeking the effective cure of diseases [65]. For example, some endogenous H2S-smart responsive nanomaterials have been utilized to develop theranostics systems for the phototherapy of cancer [66e69]. A comparison of the H2S nanoprobes as for their LOD and detection linear ranges, as well as the practical sample detections, was listed in Table 1. As can be seen from the table, most of the fluorescence turn-on probes can achieve a low LOD of H2S, holding great promise in the sensitive detection of H2S in vitro.\nAlthough H2S optical nanoprobes have made great progress in recent years, the challenges they confrontedwith are not negligible. Most nanoprobes have superiority over the traditional pure organic fluorophores in hydrophobicity and photostability, which are beneficial to the long-time tracking of H2S. However, it usually takes longer time for the cellular internalization of organic fluorophore-loaded nanomaterials. Besides, many unique optical properties of the nanoprobes require the use of heavy metal ions, which may induce potential risk in the clinical application. Moreover, most of the currently reported nanoprobes offer a sensitive detection of H2S in vitro as well as intracellularly visual imaging of\nH2S, but the investigation of their potential applications in vivo is insufficient. The main reasons for this issue can be attributed to the following aspects. First, although most nanoprobes exhibit good selectivity toward H2S in aqueous solutions, the interference by other reactive species for the detection in vivo is unknown due to the highly complicated environment in living biosystem and the rapid metabolism of biological H2S. Second, from the aspect of the concerning nanotoxicity caused by nanomaterials, the current biosafety evaluation of nanomaterials are limit to the cellular test level, and the biosafety of them in vivo is still unknown. Third, the nanoprobes reported previously usually have good sensitivity in vitro, but fail to offer a fast response to H2S or a broad detection range, which are critical issues in the real-time detection in vivo.\nFrom the aspect of nanomaterials, instead of only being a platform to carry the organic fluorophores, more attention should be paid on the functionalization of nanomaterials and tailoring their properties to fulfill the requirement of sensitive and rapid detection of H2S in vivo. For example, H2S-activatable polymer oligomers insitu self-assemble to nanoparticles by a reversible reaction to produce detectable optical signals. To eliminate the biological nanotoxicity of H2S nanoprobes, more nontoxic nanomaterials should be exploited as alternatives to the metal ion-containing materials. For example, polymeric nanomaterials are supposed to be promising candidates because of their comparable biocompatibility to lipidbased nanovesicles and the unlimited possibility to endow with astonishing optical properties. To further achieve the applications of H2S nanoprobes in vivo, kinetic mapping of H2S by nanoprobes with long circulation time should be investigated extensively to obtain a dynamic detection of H2S. As for imaging technologies, the emerging imaging technology such as photoacoustic tomography should be expanded intensively, due to their high sensitivity and deep depth of real-time imaging in vivo. The coupling of fluorescent and non-fluorescent imaging technology may propose a new perspective on the kinetic determination of H2S in vivo and the investigation of H2S-involved biological processes. We believe that more new insights for H2S-involved physiological process will be revealed and H2S-involved diseases could be prevented with the continuous advancements in research of nanomaterials-based noninvasive determination of H2S in living tissues.\nDeclaration of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare."
