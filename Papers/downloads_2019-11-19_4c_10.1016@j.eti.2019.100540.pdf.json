ZnO-NPs loaded parthenium weed activated carbon (ZnONPs-PWAC) is used to remove pollutants (Methylene Blue (MB) and Chromium (Cr (VI)) from aqueous solution and also extended to treat with real industrial tannery wastewater. A comprehensive analysis is done with various forms of ZnO based particles (ZnO-NPs, ZnONPs-PWAC) to test its photocatalytic activity. Further, the photocatalytic activity of biosynthesized ZnO-NPs is evaluated by measuring the efficiency of decolorization (>93%) for different dyes (Malachite Green, Congo Red, and Methylene Blue) under sunlight irradiation. The maximum removal (> 99%) of MB is obtained at 60 min by ZnONPs-PWAC and 130 min by PWAC. The maximum equilibrium percentage removal of Cr (VI) is found to be 99% around 90 min for ZnONPsPWAC and 160 min for PWAC. The enhancement in removal efficiency is due to the combined reaction of photocatalysis and adsorption. The parameters such as pollutant concentration, pH, and the amount of ZnONPs-PWAC are varied to understand its effective removal of MB and Cr (VI) in wastewater. Moreover, the efficiency of ZnONPsPWAC is found to be more than 92% against industrial tannery wastewater. Overall, ZnONPs-PWAC can be used as an alternative and operative material to remove MB and Cr (VI) in wastewater treatment.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

      "text" : "Water pollution is one of the critical environmental problems worldwide. Wastewater containing dyes and heavy metal ions discharged from various industries induce voluminous mutilation to the ecological system of water bodies (Nasrollahzadeh et al., 2018). The toxic dyes and heavy metals present in wastewater are considered to be harmful to the ecological system due to their chemical stability, difficulty in purification, toxicity, and transport through the trophic\n∗ Correspondence to: Department of Biotechnology, College of Biological and Chemical Engineering, Addis Ababa Science and Technology University, Addis Ababa 16417, Ethiopia.\nE-mail address: drkamarajm@gmail.com (M.

These contaminants create several mutagenic, toxic, teratogenic and carcinogenic effects on aquatic and human life, resulting in several human health disorders such as organ dysfunctions of the kidney, brain, liver, reproductive system, central nervous system and epigenetic alterations even at very low concentration (Ozdes et al., 2010; Bazrafshan et al., 2015).\nChromium (Cr) is one of the heavy metals which mainly exist as Cr (III) and Cr (VI) in a natural environment. Among these, Cr (VI) is more soluble, mobile and toxic. It causes destructive effects on animals and humans than Cr (III) (Modenes et al., 2017). Hexavalent chromium is disposed into the environment by the discharge of wastewater from several industries (leather tanning, textile, cement, steel, metal processing, electroplating, etc.) (Nakkeeran et al., 2018). Particularly, methylene blue (MB) is one of the most frequently used basic dyes in several applications including dyeing of cotton, leather, wool, paper, silk and the production of ink and quality control test of concrete and motor, etc. (Tsai et al., 2009). The contamination of this dye into water bodies causes acute toxic effects to human-like skin irritation, itching, exasperation to the gastrointestinal tract with symptoms of nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, chest pain, severe headache, profuse sweating, methemoglobinemia, dyspnea, and cyanosis, etc. if ingested along with water. It also creates a permanent injury to the human and animal eyes (Bukallah et al., 2007; Ho et al., 2009).\nThe removal of such bio resilient and toxic pollutants from wastewater can be achieved by various physical and chemical methods like reverse osmosis ozonation, biosorption, membrane filtration, coagulation, adsorption, biodegradation, electrochemical oxidation, adsorption, and photocatalytic degradation, etc. (Ghaedi et al., 2015; Kamaraj et al., 2014). Among them, adsorption and photocatalytic degradation techniques received much attention due to its cost-effective operational process (Chatterjee et al., 2010; Nasrollahzadeh et al., 2018)\nActivated carbon (AC) is a low cost and non-toxic material which is considered as an adsorbent for pollutant removal due to its high surface area and porous structure (Sathishkumar et al., 2012). Nanoparticles are the most well-utilized materials in photocatalytic degradation of pollutants that can be more effective when loaded on the surface of activated carbon and receiving much interest in recent years on wastewater treatment (Ghaedi et al., 2013; Roosta et al., 2014; Fu et al., 2015; Khosravi et al., 2018). Zinc Oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) (n-type semiconductor metal oxide) are drawing interest in a wide range of applications, including photocatalytic degradation due to its non-toxic, effective and inexpensive to produce (Agarwal et al., 2017).\nParthenium hysterophorus L. (Asteraceae family) is selected as a pernicious weed to synthesis activated carbon and ZnO nanoparticles (nano-adsorbent) in this work. Parthenium is an annual herb, aggressive alien weed species and it has been considered as one of the top ten worst noxious weeds of the world and has assumed the status of a significant health hazard (Rajeshwari and Subburam, 2002). In Ethiopia, the colonization efficiency of the weed is much higher than other indigenous plants, resulting in the reduction of cultivable areas of agricultural lands. As of now, there are no sustainable long term management strategies to eradicate this weed (Getachew, 2017). However, the utilization of this weed plant as the source for the preparation of nanoparticle-loaded activated carbon would be an economical and practical approach for environmental cleanup.\nIn this work, ZnO Nanoparticle loaded parthenium weed activated carbon (ZnONPs-PWAC) is produced by a green waste conversion method for the removal of pollutants from aqueous solution. MB and Cr are used as the model pollutants to determine the adsorption efficiency of ZnONPs-PWAC at different experimental conditions such as pH, nano-adsorbent and adsorbate dose in aqueous solution. Further, Cr removal efficiency of ZnONPs-PWAC is also investigated with industrial wastewater, collected from Ethiopia."

The functional groups of phytochemicals in the extract facilitate the reduction of the process of metals, and subsequently form the numbers of nanoparticles with controlled particle size and shape (Mohamad et al., 2014).

As seen in Fig. 3a, ZnO-NPs exhibit different shapes such as hexagonal and spherical, and it can be attributed due to the effect of the metal-reducing capacity of PWP extract. These particles possess an average size below 25 to 95 nm, and it is found to be arbitrary, inconsistent and aggregated/clustered forms. This is in good agreement with previously reported work (Rajiv et al., 2013).\nThe densification of agglomeration may create a narrow space between the particles for uniform distribution of oxidized metal anions in the 3-D polymeric network structure (Sangeetha et al., 2011). SEM analysis of PWAC (Fig. 3b) shows that the morphology contains many various sizes of holes and caves, which may be due to ZnCl2 evaporation during the carbonization step (Rajeshwari et al., 2010). The porous nature of activated carbon may provide a more possibility of additional loading space for ZnO-NPs. Fig. 3c shows many white spots distributed over the surface of PWAC, confirming the presence of ZnO-NPs on the external surface of PWAC. Even though some of the pores of PWAC are occupied by ZnO-NPs, the sample still exhibits a porous nature with a relatively large pore volume (Muthirulan et al., 2013). The addition of ZnO-NPs on PWAC is increases the more active site and surface area of the nano-adsorbent, which improves the adsorption efficiency of the contaminants (Liu et al., 2017)."

The peak at 3375 cm−1 is due to free NH stretching vibrations and peaks at 1395 cm−1, and 1533 cm−1 are due to N–H bending mode. The peak at 1600 cm−1 confirms the primary amines, whereas the peak at 2245 cm−1 indicates the presence of alkyls (C≡C stretch) and nitriles (C≡N stretch) vibrations. These results confirm the presence of certain plant compounds, which are responsible for the reduction, capping and stability of the ZnO-NPs (Datta et al., 2017; Sindhura et al., 2013).\nFrom Fig. 4c, the presence of organic components in PWP (Fig. 4a) is disappeared after performing carbonization. The peaks at 864 cm−1 and 1434 cm−1 indicates the presence of group C–O–H and C==C, respectively. The peak broadening around 1552–1664 cm−1 is probably caused by the formation of C–O formation, which coincides with the C==C (Chafidz et al., 2018). ZnONPs-PWAC (Fig. 4d) shows some more peaks at 864 and 1434, 1637 cm−1, which are similar to PWAC.

This result shows that the removal rate percentage for both MB and Cr (VI) is increased rapidly for ZnONPs-PWAC, as compared to PWAC.\nThe experiment is carried out under light and dark condition to identify the difference in the removal efficiency of both materials (Fig. 5). The removal efficiency is found to be higher (>99%) under light irradiation, as compared to the dark condition. However, effective behavior is more perceptible when the concentration of pollutants is lower than the initial concentration. For both test pollutants, the rapid reduction of concentration in the first stage is due to the adsorption reaction between adsorbate and adsorbent. The removal is higher for ZnONPs-PWAC than PWAC due to the combined reaction of photocatalysis and adsorption. The adsorption leads to the reduction of test molecule concentration in an aqueous solution that allows the light source to reach the surface of the ZnONPs-PWAC, which triggers the photocatalytic mechanism of ZnO-NPs loaded on the surface of the carbon.\nThe maximum removal percentage is recorded around 150 min for MB and 180 min for Cr (VI) treated by ZnONPsPWAC under dark condition, which is lesser than PWAC (130 min for MB and 160 min for Cr (VI). The removal efficiency of ZnONPs-PWAC is delayed in a smaller extent than PWAC under dark condition. This is due to the surface area and porosity values of ZnONPs-PWAC, which are lesser than the PWAC (Cruz et al., 2017). Mesopores of AC is vital for the absorption of organic compounds from the suspension (Hadoun et al., 2013). When ZnO-NPs are loaded, the porosity characteristics are altered to less extent and cause a small decrease in microporosity volume. The efficiency reduces under dark condition as there is no light to activate the photocatalytic mechanism of the ZnO-NPs that make them inactive. This is in good agreement with previous literature (Cruz et al., 2017; Altintig and Kirkil, 2016; Kakavandi et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2013). Overall, ZnONPs-PWAC has improved and better Cr (VI) and MB removal efficiency than PWAC. The impregnation of ZnO-NPs enhances the removal of a cationic dye and heavy metals in the aqueous phase."

Moreover, the percentage\nof removal is increased with increment in adsorbent, which probably due to the increase in the availability of active sites and surface area on the ZnONPs-PWAC (Jung et al., 2013). The maximum removal equilibrium is obtained for MB at 40 mg and Cr (VI) at 50 mg of nano-adsorbent. Further, the increase in adsorbent levels does not bring any significant changes in the removal as the pollutant reaches a saturation level (Kakavandi et al., 2014).

The initial concentration of adsorbate molecules provides a vital driving force to sweep overall mass transfer resistance between the aqueous and solid phases (Ho et al., 2005; Dogan et al., 2004). As seen in Fig. 7, the percentage of removal decreased from 99 to 89% for MB and 99 to 68% for Cr (VI). This is due to the further increase in the initial concentration of test pollutant (MB and Cr (VI)). The excess pollutant concentration leads to a decrease in the removal percentage probability due to the saturation and limitation of ZnONPs-PWACs active surface.

      "text" : "To check the effect of solution pH on the removal of MB and Cr (VI) from aqueous solutions by ZnONPs-PWAC, the experiment is performed at different pH values ranging from 2 to 10. The other parameters are fixed as follows: initial concentration of test sample - 20 mg L−1 for Cr (VI) and 20 mg L−1 for MB; dosage of ZnONPs-PWAC- 50 mg; contact time - 3 h. The obtained results are depicted in Fig. 8. The maximum removal percentage of >98% is observed at pH 2.0 and 6.0 for Cr (VI) and MB, respectively. In the case of Cr (VI), the removal efficiency is decreased with increasing the pH from 3.0 to 10.0 as >98 to 48%. The exception is observed at extreme acidic pH (∼2), the difference in Cr existing form and profusion amount of H+ ions may block the active sites of ZnONPs-PWAC, leading to lower removal efficiency. For MB removal, the removal efficiency is increased from 53 to 99% with increasing pH from 2.0 to 10.0.\nThe removal efficiency of ZnONPs-PWAC is attributed based on the solution pH, which influences the sorption affinity by either altering the ionic forms of the test solution adsorbent or the surface properties (Attia et al., 2010). The pH of the solution affects the removal process by different functioning pathways such as structural changes, changes in charge of both adsorbate and adsorbent (Ghaedi et al., 2015). The removal of test pollutants (MB and Cr (VI)) by ZnONPs-PWAC can be conveyed by electrostatic interaction and chemical reaction.\nChromium exists in two forms at acidic pH: as chromic acid (H2CrO4) in the pH range of 1–2 and as hydrogen chromate ions (HCrO4−) in the pH range of 3–7 (Sakulthaew et al., 2017). Particularly, ZnONPs-PWAC surface protonated by hydrogen ions at strong acidic conditions, and it leads to the positively charged surface and favors the electrostatic attraction between Cr (VI) as in the form of HCrO4− (Garg et al., 2007; Demiral et al., 2008). Cr (VI) removal efficiency of ZnONPs-PWAC is decreased at an alkaline condition due to the existence of Cr (VI) in the form of chromate ions (CrO42−), which is rivalry with the hydroxide ions presented on the sorbent surface (Karthikeyan et al., 2005; Parlayici et al., 2015). This explanation supports the high Cr (VI) adsorption capacity at acidic pH (3), and it is subsequently reduced by increasing pH values due to the gradual conversion of CrO42− and Cr2O72− ions (Garg et al., 2007; Enniya et al., 2018). The tendency of active sites in the adsorbent attaches to the reactive centers of MB is triggered by the increasing solution pH of MB, resulting in high removal efficiency at pH 10. The pKa values of MB molecule is 3.8 and increasing the pH from acidic to alkaline, leading to electrostatic interaction attraction force, thereby increasing the dye removal (Dogan et al., 2004).\nThe variation in the removal of Cr (VI) and MB depends on the initial pH of the test solution. The surface of ZnONPsPWAC may get a positive charge at lower pH (<5) due to the presence of H3O+ ions (Baccar et al., 2009; Asfaram et al., 2014), leading electrostatic attraction between Cr (VI) and electrostatic repulsion between MB molecules. In contrast, the surface of ZnONPs-PWAC is negatively charged at higher pH (>5) which is ascribed due to the weakened protonation degree of carbon surface with the predominance of OH−ions and deprotonation of anionic oxygen functional groups (Li et al., 2008). The negatively charged ZnONPs-PWAC in the test solution disperses Cr (VI) homogeneously via electrostatic repulsion (Hu et al., 2013), but also enrich electrostatic attraction with the cationic MB molecules (Ramesha et al., 2011; Peng et al., 2016)."

      "text" : "The treatment of industrial wastewater is a challenging task because it has different micropollutants, which influence the effect of adsorbent used for the treatment. Further testing has been expanded to check the efficiency of ZnONPs-PWAC on real tannery industry wastewater where the micropollutants are diverse in nature. The physicochemical parameters such as COD, TDS, BOD, So42− and Cr (VI) are measured in a homogenized wastewater sample before and after treatment with ZnONPs-PWAC, as shown in Table 2 (average value of triplicates). The removal efficiency (%) is measured around 92,91,92,93,98 (TIWW1), 89,90,91,92,99 (TIWW2) and 91,91,92,93,98 (TIWW2) for the parameters of COD, TDS, BOD, So42− and Cr (VI), respectively. Swathi et al. (2014) reported the reduction of COD, BOD, and Cr (VI) are found to be 68%, 73%, and 79.9% respectively in tannery water treated with rice husk as an adsorbent. The reduction percentage is found to be 81, 91, 86, 93 and 88 for COD, TDS, BOD, So42− and Cr (VI), respectively, for the tannery wastewater treated with rice husk silica powder (Sivakumar, 2015). The reduction rate found in the present study is comparatively more than the previous studies (Sivakumar, 2015; Swathi et al., 2014). The validated optimum result from the study indicates that the efficiency of ZnONPs-PWAC on real tannery industry wastewater and it can also be extended to the other type of industrial wastewater. Further investigations are required to test the material efficiency in column experiments on multiple wastewater effluents with different organic and inorganic contaminants."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusion",
      "text" : "The composite material (ZnONPs-PWAC) is successfully developed by loading ZnO-NPs on the surface of AC. AC is prepared from an abundant noxious weed Parthenium, collected from Ethiopia. The synthesized materials are characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR and BET analysis for better understanding their nature. The photocatalytic activity of green synthesized ZnO-NPs is tested on selected dyes and found to be dominant. The new nano-adsorbent (ZnONPs-PWAC) developed has applied to remove MB and Cr (VI) from aqueous solution. Experiments that combine adsorption and photocatalysis are carried out with, and without sunlight irradiation. It reveals that the ZnONPs-PWAC has improved and better Cr (VI) and MB removal efficiency than that of PWAC. The optimum adsorbent, dosage (mg), adsorbate concentration (mg L−1) and pH for ZnONPs-PWAC are obtained as 40, 80, 10 (MB) and 50,30,3 (Cr (VI)), respectively. The efficiency of ZnONPs-PWAC is further tested in three tannery industrial wastewater. It is observed that the percentage of reduction is more than 90% on the parameters such as COD, TDS, BOD, So42− and Cr (VI). From the analysis, ZnONPs-PWAC has many advantages like high surface area, combined mechanism, high pollutant removal capacity, adequate sensitivity, productivity, simple synthesis, and cost-effective.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."

    "abstractText" : "In this study, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) and activated carbon (AC) are produced from parthenium weed plant using a green synthesis technique. ZnO-NPs loaded parthenium weed activated carbon (ZnONPs-PWAC) is used to remove pollutants (Methylene Blue (MB) and Chromium (Cr (VI)) from aqueous solution and also extended to treat with real industrial tannery wastewater. A comprehensive analysis is done with various forms of ZnO based particles (ZnO-NPs, ZnONPs-PWAC) to test its photocatalytic activity. Further, the photocatalytic activity of biosynthesized ZnO-NPs is evaluated by measuring the efficiency of decolorization (>93%) for different dyes (Malachite Green, Congo Red, and Methylene Blue) under sunlight irradiation. The maximum removal (> 99%) of MB is obtained at 60 min by ZnONPs-PWAC and 130 min by PWAC. The maximum equilibrium percentage removal of Cr (VI) is found to be 99% around 90 min for ZnONPsPWAC and 160 min for PWAC. The enhancement in removal efficiency is due to the combined reaction of photocatalysis and adsorption. The parameters such as pollutant concentration, pH, and the amount of ZnONPs-PWAC are varied to understand its effective removal of MB and Cr (VI) in wastewater. Moreover, the efficiency of ZnONPsPWAC is found to be more than 92% against industrial tannery wastewater. Overall, ZnONPs-PWAC can be used as an alternative and operative material to remove MB and Cr (VI) in wastewater treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
