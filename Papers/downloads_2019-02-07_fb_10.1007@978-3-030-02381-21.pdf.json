      "text" : "Three percent of the electricity consumption in fully industrialized countries is accounted for by wastewater treatment (McCarty et al. 2011; Rothausen and Conway 2011). In China and other developing countries, this value is roughly 1.5%\nM. Siegert (*) Independent Investigator, Chicago, IL, USA e-mail: michael@siegert.org\nJ. M.

Much of the wastewater produced in developing countries is still discharged untreated (Liang et al. 2018). At the same time, the reuse of wastewater resources can turn treatment facilities into net energy producers (Shizas and Bagley 2004). Several technologies are able to accomplish this with anaerobic membrane bed reactors (AnMBR) being the most mature (van Lier et al. 2016). Another promising future technology is bio-electrical systems (BES). Depending on the quality of thewastewater, all of these technologies routinely removemore than 80% chemical oxygen demand (COD) and recover the respective energy amount. COD reduction and energy recovery result in substantial savings during the construction and operation ofwastewater treatment plants (WWTP; Fig. 1.1). Throughout this article,we use market prices of $0.06 kWh 1 and $3 MMBtu 1 as baseline for our technoeconomic assessment. Material costs were extracted from the respective publications, or inquired from manufacturers and retailers either through quotations or Internet offers. Unlike in most previous cost assessments of BES technologies, we used a scaling coefficient of 0.6 to account for capital expenditure discounts in large-scale applications but admit that this is somewhat arbitrary (Tribe and Alpine 1986).We also include savings of 80% incurred from reduced COD loading after BES treatment.\nTwo different types of BES are possible (Fig. 1.2), microbial fuel cells (MFC) and microbial electrolysis cells (MEC). MFCs directly harvest electrical power using wastewater organics as fuel, with oxygen as terminal electron acceptor. The\nWWTP 200 m3/d 20 g/L COD 5,800 kWh/d\ntechnology has been known for more than a century and was heavily investigated during the last two decades (Potter 1911; He et al. 2005; Logan and Rabaey 2012). Despite these efforts, power densities remain low compared with conventional hydrogen fuel cells. This situation might be improved using better materials for electrodes and membranes. MECs experienced two stages of discovery, first cathodic nitrate reduction was reported by Sakakibara and Kuroda (1993). Fifteen years later, organic matter degradation coupled to hydrogen production was discovered by Rozendal and Buisman (2010). The difference of MECs to MFCs is that a small voltage is applied, which improves reaction kinetics and makes it easier to control the treatment process. As a result, hydrogen gas is produced which is then converted into methane (Kuroda andWatanabe 1995). The process is naturally exergonic and called acetoclastic methanogenesis, assuming that acetate is the substrate:\nRxn1 ! H3C COO þ Hþ þ H2O ! CH4 þ HCO 3 þ Hþ; ΔG 0 ¼ 31kJmol 1 CH4ð Þ\nThe application of a small electrical potential to the reaction, for example, 0.7 V, drastically improves the energy balance for acetoclastic microbes by additional 540 kJ mol−1 (CH4), and hence also microbial reaction kinetics. Ultimately, this\nleads to shorter hydraulic retention times (HRTs) and about 20 times smaller reactors, occupying four times less area. While size reduction makes MECs more attractive compared with MFCs, downstream combustion of produced gases, usually methane, in turbines occurs at notoriously low energy efficiencies between 30 and 40%. In contrast, the direct conversion of wastewater energy into electricity in MFCs eliminates the need for inefficient combustion steps.\nDespite intensive research and a long history, BES technology is still in its infancy. While there have been some attempts to commercialize BES for wastewater treatment, there is still room for improvement. For MFCs, this is arguably power density and for MECs it is gas production, which ultimately translates into power density as well. We therefore suggest to use dollar per peak power capacity ($Wp\n1) as a benchmark for cost assessment. Dollar per power production ($[Ws] 1) would still be better but such data are usually not reported. Nanomaterials are promising leads to solve the problem of power density in wastewater BES. There are three different types of nanomaterials that can potentially be used in BES: carbon-based, metal-based, and mineral nanomaterials. These materials may be in suspension, electrode deposits, or in membranes. Depending on the location, they serve different purposes. On electrodes they may improve attachment of microorganisms, increase the catalytic surface area, reduce over potentials, and so forth."

      "text" : "Both MEC and MFC technologies face similar economic challenges when treating wastewater. They work better with high strength wastewater and are therefore better applicable for industrial waste streams where COD concentrations exceed 5 g L 1. To some extent, lower COD concentrations can be compensated for by larger volumes, which, however, also drive electrode costs as more electrode surface is required. Additionally, a potential can be applied in MECs to improve COD removal rates. This is accomplished at the expense of anodic corrosion. Anodes are therefore the bottleneck in MECs. In MFCs, the cost driver is the cathode. Cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are limited by oxygen diffusion and catalyst wear. An excellent review on BES cathodes and their workings was published by Liu et al. (2014). As further detailed in the section on cathodes, some power outputs of MFCs using nanomaterials reach 12 Wp m\n2 (Wen et al. 2012, 2014) as opposed to hydrogen fuels, which routinely exceed 5 kWp m\n2 (Al-Baghdadi 2005). For our estimates we used a typical fuel cell voltage of 0.7 V. At this voltage, others suggested that a power output of 10–20 Wp m\n2 would be required to operate MFCs profitably, but scaling factors were not taken into account and expensive precious metal cathodes were used for previous evaluations (Sleutels et al. 2012). With such low power output, neither the use of precious metals nor mixed metal oxide cathodes appears to be justified and cheap carbon should be considered, perhaps in combination with iron or manganese minerals (Table 1.1). As in conventional fuel cells, platinum on carbon (Pt/C) is often used in MFCs as well. Due to its high power densities (for MFCs), frequently surpassing 2 Wp m 2, it is also cheap on a\nT ab\nle 1. 1\nR an ki ng\nof M F C ca th od\ne na no\nm at er ia ls in\nte rm\ns of\nar ea l pe rf or m an ce\nC at eg or y\nA no\nde\nA no de ar ea in cm 2\nC at ho de su pp or t\nC at ho de ar ea in cm\n2 C at ho\nde ca ta ly st\nC at al ys t lo ad in m g cm 2\nC ha m be rs\nP in\nW p\nm 2 (c at ho\nde )\nR ef er en ce\nP re ci ou\ns m et al\nC ar bo\nn br us h\nN A\nC – cl ot h\n1 P t/C\n5 D ua l\n2. 8\nH ou\net al .( 20\n16 )\nC ar bo\nn G ra ph\nen e/\nP E D O T\n5 C – pa pe r\n12 N A\nN A\nD ua l\n2. 1\nW an g et al .( 20\n13 b)\nN an oc om\npo si te\nC ar bo\nn fe lt\n78 G D L\n10 M nO\n2 – gr ap he ne\nna no\nsh ee t\n5 S in gl e\n2. 1\nW en\net al .( 20\n12 )\nN an oc om\npo si te\nC ar bo\nn br us h\nN A\nC – cl ot h\n1 N -d op\ned gr ap he ne /C N T / C oN i\n5 D ua l\n2. 0\nH ou\net al .( 20\n16 )\nC ar bo\nn G ra ph\nite pl at e\n5 S te el m es h\n1 N -d op\ned ca rb on\nna no\nfi be rs\nN A\nD ua l\n1. 9\nC he n et al .( 20\n12 )\nG ra ph\nen e\nG ra ph\nen e– st ee l\n3. 2\nC – fe lt\n2 N A\nN A\nD ua l\n1. 3\nH ou\net al .( 20\n14 )\nG ra ph\nen e\nC ar bo\nn fe lt\n10 C – pa pe r\nN A\nF e/ N – fu nc tio\nna liz ed\ngr ap he ne\nN A\nS in gl e\n1. 2\nL ie t al .( 20\n12 )\nC ar bo\nn C ar bo\nn br us h\n12 .5\nG D L\n10 N -d op\ned na no\nsh ee t on\ngr ap he ne\n5 S in gl e\n1. 1\nW en\net al .( 20\n14 )\nG ra ph\nen e\nN -d op ed gr ap he ne\n1. 5\nC – cl ot h\n1. 5\nN A\nN A\nD ua l\n1. 0\nK ir ub\nah ar an\net al .\n(2 01\n5)\nG ra ph\nen e\nC ar bo\nn cl ot h\n9 C – pa pe r\n9 N -d op\ned gr ap he ne\n2 D ua l\n0. 8\nL iu\net al .( 20\n13 b)\nP re ci ou\ns m et al\nG oe th ite – st ee l\n12 .6\nC – m es h\nN A\nP t/C\n0. 5\nS in gl e\n0. 7\nP en g et al .( 20\n13 b)\nP re ci ou\ns m et al\nC – cl ot h\n7 C – cl ot h\n7 P t/C\nN A\nS in gl e\n0. 5\nC he ng\net al .( 20\n06 )\nN an oc om\npo si te\nC – cl ot h\n7 C – cl ot h\n7 C oT\nM P P\n0. 6\nS in gl e\n0. 4\nC he ng\net al .( 20\n06 )\nG ra ph\nen e\nC – cl ot h\n5 C – cl ot h\n5 B io -m\nod ifi ed\ngr ap he ne\nN A\nD ua l\n0. 3\nZ hu\nan g et al .\n(2 01\n2)\nC ar bo\nn C – cl ot h\n20 C – cl ot h\n1 C ar bo n na no\nfi be rs\n14 S in gl e\n0. 2\nS an to ro\net al .\n(2 01\n3 )\n(c on\ntin ue d)\nT ab\nle 1. 1\n(c on\ntin ue d)\nC at eg or y\nA no\nde\nA no de ar ea in cm\n2 C at ho\nde su pp or t\nC at ho de ar ea in cm 2\nC at ho de ca ta ly st\nC at al ys t lo ad in m g cm\n2 C ha m be rs\nP in\nW p\nm 2 (c at ho\nde )\nR ef er en ce\nC ar bo\nn R V C\n97 R V C\n19 4\nN A\nN A\nS in gl e\n0. 2\nH e et al .( 20\n05 )\nP re ci ou\ns m et al\nS in gl e– w al le d ca rb ox y– C N T\n20 C – cl ot h\n20 .2 5\nP t/C\n0. 5\nS in gl e\n0. 2\nT he ps up\nar un\ngs ik ul\net al .( 20\n14 )\nG ra ph\nen e\nG ra ph\nite 78\n.5 C – fe lt\n1 P A N I– gr ap he ne na no sh ee ts\nN A\nS in gl e\n0. 1\nR en\net al .( 20\n13 )\nN an oc om\npo si te\nG ra ph\nite gr an -\nul es /f el t\n16 S i– w af er / na no w ir es\n6 M oS\n3 N A\nD ua l\n0. 1\nZ an g et al .( 20\n14 )\nC ar bo\nn C – fe lt\n19 7\nC – fe lt\n69 F e/ C a– P A N I\n0. 6\nS in gl e\n0. 04\nL ed ez m a et al .

The runners-up are a potpourri carbon nanofibers and graphene composites. Nitrogen or manganese can be used to improve their performance, for example, N-doped nanofibers cost ~$500 Wp 1 (Chen et al. 2012) or MnO2-graphene costs ~$2400 Wp 1 (Wen et al. 2012). For graphene, single layer material ($200 g 1) was used for our estimate but other forms may further reduce costs. Plain reticulated vitreous carbon performed slightly better than graphene with $2100 Wp\n1 (He et al. 2005). Other types of functionalized graphene were N-doped (Wen et al. 2014) or Fe/N-doped nanosheets (Li et al. 2012), both of which cost ~$4300 Wp\n1. There were several extreme outliers, orders of magnitude above or below these values. Some of them used ferricyanide as an electron acceptor. One worth noting was N-doped graphene with only $3 Wp\n1 (Hou et al. 2016). All of the abovementioned MFC cathodes use carbon materials as catalyst support. While moving closer to become economically feasible, the costs are still far away fromwhat is necessary to operateMFC profitably. MFC cathodes need to be large, which is not only an engineering challenge but also drives material and also real estate costs.\nMECs, in contrast, can be operated completely without the use of precious metal catalysts, for example, with stainless steel (Call et al. 2009). Steel is among the cheapest materials (0.4 mm steel plate, type A286, ~$430 m 2; type 304 ~$80 m 2) and can also serve as structural element in MECs, further reducing cost. As explained above, in MECs, anodes are the critical component. Escapa et al. (2012) estimated that an MEC WWTP producing hydrogen gas can be operated economically when costs of the anode compartment are below $1500 m 3 (at 2012 exchange rates). This agrees well with our own, independent calculation (Fig. 1.3), except that we use methane gas as product with a scaling coefficient of 0.6 (Tribe and Alpine 1986). While the scaling coefficient is somewhat arbitrary, existing commercial\nMEC WWTP are living evidence for this technology’s economic viability. For our calculation we used graphite granule anodes in titanium mesh drums inserted into steel pipe cathodes which also serve as MEC housing. With these assumptions, we found that electrodes make up 5 2% of total reactor costs. Future scaling experiments will show how these costs contribute in reality. Unfortunately, the data reported for MECs are, as for MFCs, not standardized. Patil et al. (2015) suggested a framework for reporting MEC performance and we refer future investigators to this excellent article in order to standardize their reports."

      "text" : "Nanomaterials in BES can, as in nonbiological applications, improve electron transfer processes (Cai and Chen 2004) and catalytic activity. Carbon nanoparticles, nanofibers, nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene are the most intensively studied nanomaterials in BES. Their synthesis is relatively simple (Box 1.1) and carbon as support material is inexpensive and widely available. It is therefore not surprising that CNTs have been used in BES where cheap electricity or gas production are the primary goals. In Shewanella, one of the model microbes in BES, CNTs redirected the electron flow between the electron donor lactate and nitrobenzene as an electron acceptor (Yan et al. 2014). The altered electron flow occurred mostly outside Shewanella cells whereas nitrobenzene had been reduced inside without CNTs, suggesting that CNTs can also improve electron flow between cells and electrodes. Carbon nanoparticles also supported hydrogenase-dependent hydrogen oxidation on indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes (Szot et al. 2013). The ITO electrodes were coated with carbon nanoparticles films which were then used to immobilize the hydrogenase enzymes.\nBox 1.1: Preparation of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) Ab initio, CNTs are prepared by high temperature techniques like arch discharge and laser ablation. Due to the high energy consumption, these methods have been replaced by low temperature (<800 C) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. Nowadays, CVD is the simplest and most popular means to grow CNTs in the laboratory since the alignment, orientation, diameter, nanotube length, purity, and density of the CNTs can be accurately controlled during synthesis. The CVD process uses hydrocarbons as the carbon sources including methane, carbon monoxide, and acetylene. Catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) is currently the standard technique for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes.\n(continued)\nBox 1.1 (continued) Procedure: All the catalyst materials are calcined in air at 500 C for 1 h, cooled to room temperature, and ground prior to CVD growth. CNTs are synthesized by using the experimental setup presented in Fig. 1.4. To prepare the reaction, 0.1 g/10 mg of the template membrane with the catalyst (Fe, Co, or Ni nanoparticles) in pores is placed in a quartz boat and then inserted into the center of a quartz tube (50 mm diameter, 800 mm length), which is mounted in an electric tube furnace. Argon is passed over the catalyst as the reactor is heated to 900 C. The argon flow is then changed for the flow of a reduced carbonaceous gas, e.g., methane, carbon monoxide, or acetylene. For example, CH4 (99% purity) is passed at the rate of 6000 cm\n3 min 1 at 1.25 bar head pressure for the desired reaction time between 10 and 30 min. The CH4 flow is then switched back to argon flow, the furnace is turned off and allowed to cool to room temperature. For large quantities of CNTs, 5.0 g of catalyst is used for a reaction time of around 30 min.\nPreparation of graphene Generally, single layer graphene (SLG) and multilayer graphene (MLG) are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) from a carbon precursor (carbon containing gases) on catalytic metal surfaces. In a surface-mediated CVD process, the carbon precursor, e.g., isopropyl alcohol (IPA), is decomposed on the metal surface, e.g., Cu or Ni. In order to control the number of graphene layers that are formed, the solubility of the carbon precursor on the metal catalyst surface has to be considered. Due to the low solubility of the precursor in Cu, SLG can be formed. It is difficult to grow SLG on the surface of a metal with a high affinity for the precursor.\nProcedure: Presented is an economical, safe, and simple technique to synthesize MLG films through CVD in 30–45 min in a chemistry laboratory. The experimental setup for the preparation of graphene is shown in Fig. 1.5. Nickel foil is immersed in acetic acid for etching followed by transferring the foil into an airtight quartz tube that will protect the system from environmental oxygen and water vapor. Nitrogen gas is bubbled through IPA, and the resulting IPA saturated gas is passed through the closed system with exhaust washed in a beaker of water or gas wash bottle. The stream purges for 5 min at a rate <50 cm3 min 1. Once the flame of a Meker burner reaches 575–625 C, it is positioned under the nickel foil, thus providing sufficient energy for the formation of graphene. The flame is extinguished after 5–10 min to stop the reaction followed by cooling the system for 5 min. The product, graphenecoated Ni foil is obtained.\nGraphene is considered superior to other carbon-based materials such as CNTs or graphite due to its rapid charge exchange rates (Lv et al. 2016), easier introduction of functional groups (Novoselov et al. 2004), easier production compared with CNTs (Lv et al. 2013), and higher surface area compared with graphite (Martin 2009). Like CNTs, graphene can be deposited on a number of surfaces, such as nickel (Mink et al. 2013), stainless steel (Hou et al. 2014), carbon (Hou et al. 2013), and so forth. These features are essential for any electrode but in particular for bioelectrodes used in wastewater treatment because cost is the most constraining factor in any utility technology besides reliability. However, some reports suggest that CNTs may be toxic to electrophilic microbes as they are for some eukaryotic cells (Flahaut et al. 2006; Martin 2009). Graphene-based materials appear to have a biocidal effect on microbial biofilm growth as well (ElMekawy et al. 2017). The biocidal effect of graphene thus limits the application of graphene to cathodic oxygen reduction reactions (Liu et al. 2013b; Ren et al. 2013) or membranes (Perreault et al. 2014;\nZhao et al. 2014) where this very effect is even desired. Despite the biocidal effect, CNTs and graphene composites can also be used as anode material, for example, as polymer composites (Wang et al. 2013b), doped for improved catalytic activity (Qu et al. 2010; Liming et al. 2014; Kirubaharan et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2015a; Hou et al. 2016) or deposited on metal (Hou et al. 2014) as well as carbon (Hou et al. 2013). Excellent reviews for graphene in MFC applications were recently provided by ElMekawy et al. (2017) and for CNTs by Yazdi et al. (2016)."

      "text" : "Metals and metal composite nanomaterials make good electrodes for enzyme and whole cell attachment and have been widely used as anode as well as cathode materials throughout the last four decades (Turner et al. 1983; Wilson and Turner 1992; Xiao et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2014). Advantages of metals are their low resistance, affinity to biological material, high structural stability, low prices, and high catalytic activities. The latter two advantages do not always apply. For example, titanium has a lower catalytic activity compared with platinum whereas platinum is more expensive. Stainless steel is a good compromise in many cases because it is cheap and catalytically modestly active. It has been used for cathodes (Call et al. 2009; Selembo et al. 2009) as well as for anodes (Dumas et al. 2007, 2008; Hou et al. 2014; Ledezma et al. 2015; Peng et al. 2016). However, nano-steel has not been used so far and steel was mostly used as structural support for other nanomaterials in composite electrodes, for example, as support for nanofibers in cathodes (Chen et al. 2012). As an anode, stainless steel has the tendency to corrode, which makes it a poor support material in composite electrodes (Ledezma et al. 2015). Like steel, nickel served as structural support, for example, with graphene coating as a hydrogen- or a methane-producing cathode (Cai et al. 2016). Nonetheless, nickel is an inexpensive hydrogen catalyst itself and its performance is comparable to some platinum nanoparticle formulations (Selembo et al. 2010). It is therefore plausible to use nickel nanowires for hydrogen-producing cathodes as well (Nie et al. 2013). Unfortunately, nickel-based electrodes have the tendency to dissolve in the electrolyte over time (Selembo et al. 2010; Siegert et al. 2014) and it is for this reason that precious metal electrodes will still play a role in BES applications. To reduce cost, metal composites with precious metals seem a viable approach. Gold/titanium dioxide CNTs were used on carbon paper anodes (Wu et al. 2013). However, the performance of 2.10 3 Wp m 2 was well below that observed in other MFCs."

      "text" : "Despite their instability (Kalska-Szostko et al. 2013), iron nanomaterials are considered promising alternatives to precious metals due to the low costs of iron ores and\ntheir virtually global availability. Iron mineral particles are well known to improve turnover rates in methanogenic microbial communities (Siegert et al. 2011; Cruz Viggi et al. 2014; Yamada et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2015b). Magnetite nanoparticles were shown to compensate for lack of pili inGeobacter (Liu et al. 2015), which have been postulated to accelerate interspecies electron transfer in methanogenic communities (Morita et al. 2011; Rotaru et al. 2013). Moreover, electrophilic microbes such as Geobacter have a great affinity to iron minerals, such as magnetite and pyrite (Reguera et al. 2005, 2007). This feature makes iron mineral nanoparticles interesting for BES wastewater treatment. While magnetite nanoparticles have been investigated in MFCs before (Peng et al. 2013a), pyrite nanowires were synthesized but never tested in BES (Cabán-Acevedo et al. 2012). Since there is evidence that nanopyrites and magnetite play a role as electron shuttles in the environment (Hellige et al. 2012; Kato and Igarashi 2018), these inexpensive iron nanostructures will receive more attention in future. Other sulfides of interest are, for example, molybdenum sulfides as they have been reported to be efficient hydrogen producers (Tokash and Logan 2011). An interesting approach is the combination of MoS3 with silicon nanowires in hydrogen photocatalysis along with anodic waste degradation (Zang et al. 2014)."

      "heading" : "1.3.4 Anodes",
      "text" : "Bio-anodes usually come with nanomaterials included. They are called microbial nanowires and are associated with improved attachment as well as electron transport between cells and electrodes (Reguera et al. 2005, 2007; Strycharz-Glaven et al. 2011; Rotaru et al. 2013). However, human nature is to further improve natural systems, and hence there is a plethora of nano-modifications of bio-anodes (Sonawane et al. 2017). Despite their biocidal effect, CNTs were often used to improve anode performance. In MFC wastewater treatment, they proved valuable anode upgrades for example, when multi-walled CNTs were used (Thepsuparungsikul et al. 2014). The introduction of oxygen functional groups further improved CNT anode performance as it was reported, for example, for carbon cloth (Li et al. 2014). Electrospun nano fibers have been used as anode material with Shewanella as an electrocatalyst (Patil et al. 2013). Current generation was tenfold higher than without nano fibers, a result which had been attributed to the increased surface area of carbon nano fibers. Another great advantage of carbon-based anodes in BES is, beside their low prices and the affinity of microbes to carbon, their corrosion resistance. Unfortunately, carbon-based materials have little catalytic activity which is not desired for some applications, for example, in water oxidizing anodes. Traditionally, precious metals were used in such cases on carbon or titanium supports. In classic hydrogen fuel cells, precious metals are still the most potent and economic catalysts when the dollar is used as reference for power density. For example, some commercial mixed metal anodes have a market price of ~ $30 Wp 1) whereas a 10% platinum on carbon electrode costs ~$0.03 Wp 1). One possible way to further reduce costs of precious metal electrodes is to increase their\nsurface, for example, by depositing nanostructures on graphite. Several other protocols exist for the synthesis of palladium nanomaterials. Chemical synthesis is conducted under rather harsh conditions, for example, under a critical CO2 atmosphere (Rezayat et al. 2014), whereas biologically synthesized nanoparticles usually require more than one step (Tuo et al. 2013; Yates and Logan 2014). An innovative approach to biologically synthesize palladium nanomaterials was proposed by Yates et al. (2014). They used Geobacter biofilms as a template to deposit a porous palladium nano-mesh on graphite support. The formation of palladium nanoparticles by Geobacter is a natural phenomenon and can be accelerated by adding an electron shuttle such as anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (Tuo et al. 2013).\nLikewise, magnetite nanoparticles are synthesized by Geobacter as well (Lovley et al. 1987). They have been used together with CNTs on MFC anodes to enhance electrical contact (Park et al. 2014). The effect was attributed to increasing the surface capacitance of magnetite nanoparticles attached to MFC anodes (Peng et al. 2012, 2013a). Another advantage of using iron nanoparticles is the high abundance of iron minerals in every part of the planet. Hence, the idea of using magnetite anodes in aqueous solutions is not new at all (Hayes and Kuhn 1978) and has been patented (Itai and Kanai 1974). Other iron minerals, such as semiconductive goethite, seem to be viable MFC anode materials as well (Peng et al. 2013b). Nonetheless, it remains to be shown what the benefit of nano-sizing iron minerals in BES for wastewater treatment is.\nBesides iron nanomaterials, other nanominerals were tested on anodes as well. Nano-crystalline lead dioxide (PbO2) applied to carbon-based anodes accelerated degradation rates of wastewater organics and nitrate in an MEC compared with other carbon-based electrodes or titanium mesh (Mook et al. 2013). While the toxicity of lead essentially prohibits the use of such electrodes for water treatment, titanium is a non-toxic, though more expensive alternative. As for iron minerals, CNTs can be used as support for titanium dioxide (TiO2) as well. This approach was chosen to prepare MFC carbon cloth anodes (Wen et al. 2013). The combination of TiO2 and CNTs improved overall MFC performance compared with TiO2 nanoparticles or CNTs alone."

      "heading" : "1.3.5 Cathodes",
      "text" : "MFC cathodes traditionally contain precious metal catalysts such as platinum on carbon (Pt/C). However, at MFC power densities between 1 and 2 Wp m 2 (Table 1.1) electrode cost of $100–$150 m 2 (Sleutels et al. 2012) render the use of precious metals uneconomical as Pt/C electrode costs usually exceed this limit ($2800 m 2). Unfortunately, Pt/C is still the most economical cathode catalyst for MFCs. Power densities at least one order of magnitude higher are therefore required but unrealistic (see Table 1.1) as MFC performance also depends on anodic oxidation rates and thus on microbial metabolism. Hence, cheaper carbon-based materials seem the only realistic alternative. As in anodes, CNTs improved the performance of oxygen\nreduction reactions (ORR; Reid et al. 2016). Also as demonstrated for anodes, oxygen functional groups further improved performance by accelerating ORR rates (Dumitru et al. 2014). In anoxic cathodic reactions, such as acetate formation, CNTs improved productivity (Jourdin et al. 2014). Albeit toxic for some eukaryotic cells (Flahaut et al. 2006), CNTs improved biofilm formation of acetogenic bacteria in this case. The cytotoxic effects of CNTs may be further compensated for if the research community finds ways to improve attachment to cathode surfaces (Reid et al. 2016). As for CNTs, graphene was shown to improve the performance of ORR (Zhuang et al. 2012), especially after activation by introducing oxygen, nitrogen, or iron functional groups (Wen et al. 2014). The obtained power density of 1 Wp m\n2 was double compared with 10% Pt/C and doubled again when a graphene-manganese hybrid cathode was used (Wen et al. 2012). Besides manganese, iron minerals are promising and inexpensive cathodic catalysts as well (Li et al. 2012). For example, a polyaniline-iron composite MFC air cathode was prepared by breaking the polymer in order to insert iron minerals resulting in a performance that was similar to that of Pt/C (Lai et al. 2013). A mix of iron minerals on graphite felt slightly out-performed the Pt/C air cathode in an MFC, resulting in a 99% cost reduction when only materials were considered (Wang et al. 2013a). However, the employed iron pentacarbonyl (Fe[CO]5) is toxic and requires special handling. In MFCs, such platinum cathodes can reach current densities of about 0.5 Wp m\n2 (Cheng et al. 2006). Another popular iron nanomineral in BES is magnetite. While in suspension magnetite nanoparticle accelerated hydrogen gas production (Gacitúa et al. 2014), no such performance improvement was observed when carbon-magnetite composite biocathodes produced methane gas (Siegert et al. 2014). Carbon-mineral composites certainly deserve more attention in future BES exploration. While CNTs and graphene are supposed to be “metal free” catalysts, they include metal impurities that are “for free” and likely responsible for some of the observed performance improvements using these materials (Wang and Pumera 2014). On the other hand, precious metal catalysts lose their catalytic activity over time, in MECs (Siegert et al. 2014) as well as in MFCs (Santoro et al. 2013) making carbon nanomaterials serious alternative to precious metal catalysts on anodes. And indeed, carbon nanofiber cathodes in MFCs performed as well as platinum cathode over 3 months (Santoro et al. 2013). Another alternative to precious metal cathodes is inexpensive metal minerals. Molybdenum sulfide nanosheets have been used as hydrogen catalyst in MEC (Ji et al. 2013)."

      "text" : "Nanomaterials coating membranes can help to improve their selective permeability (Chan et al. 2014; Hong and Chen 2014). A similar effect was observed when carbon nanofibers where used to re-enforce sulfonated polyether ether ketone membrane (Chae et al. 2014). The result was an overall better proton permeability compared with Nafion® membranes. Nafion® membranes can be improved for MFC voltage output when activated CNTs are incorporated during the polymerization process of\nthe membranes (Ghasemi et al. 2012). Recently, it was shown that a graphene-gold sandwich membrane could be used to control the permeability for water (Zhou et al. 2018), which may be useful when gradients in dual chamber reactors need to be reduced. This could reduce high Ohmic resistances in BES.\nA short-term antifouling effect was demonstrated for composite membranes functionalized with graphene (Liu et al. 2013a; Perreault et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2014). Other antifouling nanomaterials are silver (Gomez-Carretero et al. 2017) or copper-based (Lejars et al. 2012) nanoparticles. On cathodes their excellent conductivity combined with their biocidal effect may prove excellent coating materials. However, they were not intensively studied so far. In Box 1.2, we show easy recipes for synthesizing biocidal silver nanoparticles using microbes, such as bacteria and fungi. Little is known about the use of nanomaterials in BES electrolytes.\nFor example, inexpensive carbon nanofibers were used in the electrolyte to improve MFC performance (Rinzler et al. 2012). Deeke et al (2015) showed that fluidized granular carbon can act as anode, suggesting that carbon nanoparticles in the electrolyte could have a similar effect. Also magnetite is an inexpensive additive which may enhance electron transfer. The mineral was used in a hydrogenproducing MEC with Desulfovibrio as a biocatalyst (Gacitúa et al. 2014). This combination proved useful also in methane-producing MECs where Desulfovibrio and Desulfuromonas were enriched using an anaerobic digester seed (Siegert et al. 2015).\nBox 1.2: Silver Nanoparticle Synthesis from Microbes Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from bacteria:\nCulturemedium is prepared, sterilized, and inoculated with a fresh culture of Escherichia coli. The culture flasks are incubated at 37 C for 24 h and cells are removed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm. The supernatant is used for nanoparticle synthesis. Silver nitrate (1 mM) is added to the supernatant (1%V/V, final concentration 10 μM). The reaction between the supernatant and Ag+ ions occurs in the dark or light. Aliquots of the reaction solution are removed and the absorption is determined using a UV-vis spectrophotometer. The silver nanoparticles are characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray defraction, or scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM, and EDX).\nBiosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from fungi (Ahmad et al. 2003): Fusarium oxysporum is grown for 7 days. Then, the fungal biomass is filtrated and AgNO3 (10 mM) is added to the fungal liquid (1%V/V, final concentration 10 μM). The filtered biomass is resuspended in sterile water. The F. oxysporum biomass is of pale yellow color before the addition of Ag+ ions. The color changed to brownish after completion of the reaction (~28 h). To monitor the reaction, the absorption is measured in UV-vis spectra over time after the addition of 1 mM AgNO3 to the fungal biomass. The silver\n(continued)\nBox 1.2 (continued) nanoparticles are characterized by the UV-vis absorption, DLS, FTIR, SEM, EDX, and TEM.\nBiosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using yeast (Kowshik et al. 2003): Using yeast, silver nanoparticles of 2–5 nm are synthesized extracellularly by a silver-tolerant yeast strain MKY3. MKY3 is used to inoculate Erlenmeyer flasks which are incubated at 30 C on a rotary shaker at 100 rpm. The cultures are challenged with 2 mM silver nitrate and incubated further in dark for 24 h. The cells are separated from the culture medium by centrifugation (5000 g) and the cell-free medium is used for the recovery of precipitated silver nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are characterized using UV-vis, DLS, FTIR, SEM, TEM, EDX, XRD, etc.\nBiosynthesis of Silver nanoparticles using algae (Aziz et al. 2014, 2015): An algal culture in its mid- exponential phase is transferred from the culture flask into conical plastic tubes and centrifuged (5000 rpm, 5 min, 4 C). The pellets are washed thrice with deionized water to remove traces of media. Few mL of deionized water are used to resuspend the wet algal biomass. The suspension is kept at 100 C for 5 min in an Erlenmeyer flask. Then the suspension is cooled at 27 C followed by sonication for 5 min. After centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant is filtered using Whatman filter paper No. 1. The pellet is discarded, and the supernatant is used as aqueous cell extract. Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles is carried out by mixing the cell extract and a 1 mM AgNO3 solution (1:9), followed by incubation at 28 2 C for 24 h. The change in color indicates the reduction of AgNO3 to silver nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are characterized using SEM, TEM, EDX, XRD, AFM, DLS, etc."

      "text" : "The use of nanomaterials in BES is still unexplored. Nonetheless, they already are competitive with Pt/C catalysts on MFC cathodes. While there is not much improvement to be expected from the precious metal, nanofibers, graphene, and CNTs show great potential to bring MFCs closer to economic viability. This is due to similar power densities relative to reduced costs when compared to Pt/C. In MECs, we could not observe the same potential. There, power densities are often a function of the applied cell voltage and the anodic biocatalysts. For membranes, graphene may be a promising material because it allows to the permeability for water. Moreover, the biocidal effect of graphene, silver nanoparticles, and other nanomaterials could help to reduce membrane fouling. In summary, recent research on nanomaterials in BES shows greater potential in MFCs than in MECs. The reason is that MFCs are still far away from economic feasibility as opposed to MECs which are already used in commercial wastewater treatment plants to clean water in an energy-neutral way."
