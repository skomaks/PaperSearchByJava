      "text" : "Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have emerged as a potential solution to overcome the shortcomings of autologous tissue transplants and/or organ donors. To this end, the implementation of various concurrent processes is required, including the recruitment and differentiation of cells to form complex tissues in a spatially organized manner. Among these tissues, bone has a remarkably well organized structure in which the quantity, the quality, and the distribution of its different components (i.e. type I collagen (COL-I) fibrils and calcium phosphates nanocrystals) are associated with the mechanical properties of the tissue. In vitro, bone regeneration events are described through the culture of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that form three-dimensional bone-like nodules. These structures are highly textured composites of submicrometric inorganic wispy needle-like crystals embedded within an organic extracellular matrix (ECM) and are also spatially inhomogeneous on a micrometric scale in terms of physical morphology (i.e. collagen fibrils, microvesicles, cells) and chemical content (i.e. minerals) (1–5). Collagen fibrils, with a mean diameter of 78 nm, assemble into a highly organized and closepacked lamellar structure (6). Mineralization occurs in the COL-I-based ECM where the nucleation takes place in gap regions but also on the fibril surface. Gap regions are nano-scaled structures, of about 40 nm long and 20 nm high, created by a unique arrangement of COL-I molecules (6) where the crystals grow through their c-axes within the fibrils parallel to the COL-I axe. The nature and organization of the collagenous fibrillar network are critical for bone physiology (7), where sparse and disorganized fibrils results in inadequate bone mineralization (8,9). Although considerable breakthroughs have been achieved over the past 30 years, resulting in a wealth of knowledge in many fields (i.e. biochemistry, cell biology, and molecular biology),\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n5\nthe systematic characterization of bone-like nodules at the submicrometric scale is barely described in the literature. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) has emerged as a powerful method for analysingto analyze complex connective tissues, using fresh or fixed and embedded specimens. Infrared spectra provide valuable information about the chemical identification, the structure analysis, and the dynamic and molecular conformations. IR spectral analysis determines changes in cortical and trabecular bone quality as it provides simultaneously quantitative and qualitative information on all main bone tissue components in a spatially resolved manner (i.e. 5 - 40 μm, mostly depending on the light source and the type of detector) (10,11). Infrared microscopy (µ-IR) was successfully applied to characterize the mineralization of tissues (12,13), and stem cells or osteoblasts differentiation state (14–17) by assessing mineral-to-matrix ratio, carbonate-to-phosphate ratio, and the crystallinity and collagen cross-link maturity, providing a qualitative information on the ECM compounds and maturation (18,19). However, The the spatial inhomogeneous features of bone-like nodules constrain, however, the IR spatial resolution. Recently, efforts have been made to circumvent these constraints by coupling atomic force microscopy with infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) (20). This technique measures the transient thermal vibration of an AFM probe in contact with a sample, induced by the sample absorbing the light from a tuneabletunable infrared laser. With a lower spatial resolution, AFM-IR extends IR functionality to include spectroscopic mapping at the nanometer length scale, typically in the order of 50 - 100 nm (21–23). Advances in material sciences have garnered interest in providing intrinsic material features, such as composition, mechanical properties and surface topography; allowing stem cells commitment into desired phenotype (24). Inorganic/organic materials (ioM) with special component assemblies are thought to be useful for guiding to guide the bone regeneration process (25). We recently developed a bioactive and osteoinductive material made of poorly crystalline carbonated\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n6\nhydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and chitosan and hyaluronic acid with mechanical and structural features required for bone regeneration (26). Herein, both IR and AFM-IR tools were combined in order to obtain precise information on the chemical composition of individual bone-like nodules formed on ioM at the micro- and nanoscales. In short, the gathered data support the potential use of µ-IR and AFM-IR as reliable tools for ECM characterization of in vitro generated complex bone organoid tissues."

      "text" : "Inorganic/organic material (ioM) made of poorly crystalline carbonated hydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and chitosan/hyaluronic acid biopolymers has been recently shown to boost the early stem cell differentiation, upon one week of culture, into osteoblast-like lineage through mechanobiological phenomena (26). Despite the early expression of osteocalcin (OCN), known to impair bone formation, we observed the formation of a visible refringent material over four weeks of culture (27). Starting from two weeks of culture on ioM, stem cells MSCs formed aggregates, (see videos in supplementary data) which constantly increased in size, reaching ≈ 0.4 mm 2 and 115 µm in height with a density of around 9 ± 2 three-dimensional structures or nodules in a 15.6 mm (in diameter) culture well at the fourth week (Figure 1A and Figure SI-1). Histological transversal sections of aggregatesnodules revealed a cohesive tissue with randomly distributed cells embedded within a collagen rich-matrix and continuous cell layers at the periphery (Figure 1B and 1C). Immunohistochemistry assessment revealed the presence of positive cells for OCN and osteopontin (OPN) but also for dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein-1 (DMP-1), an osteocyte marker (Figure 1D). Transmission electron and atomic force microscopies showed dense bundles and fibrils surrounding cells, characterized by 67 and 62 nm banding periodicity with fibril diameter of around 175 nm (Figure 1E and Figure 1F),\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n7\nsignature of type I collagen (COL I)COL-I (28,29). Furthermore, alizarin red staining evidenced a mineral deposit (Figure 1G). Taken together, these results suggest that cell aggregation leads to the formation of bone-like nodule structures. Standard molecular technics such as qRT-PCR are typically used to assess the in vitro osteoblastic commitment and are commonly combined with immunofluorescent or histological matrix staining including Von Kossa, Alizarin Red or Sirius Red (30). However, such approaches require considerable sample preparation, are semiquantitative and, crucially, fail to provide sufficient information to define a specific mineralization stage of a cell-compact cell nodulesnodule (3). COL-I, the most abundant protein in bone, confers to bone its mechanical stability, strength and toughness. An altered hierarchical structure of collagen molecules affects the mineralization process that occurs within and around fibers (8,9,31). Herein, bone-like nodules were characterized at different scales using Single Scan polarization-resolved Second Harmonic Generation (SS-pSHG) and Polarized light (PLM) microscopies. The nonlinear signal being sensitive to the polarization state of the excitation light, SS-pSHG emission is likely to depend on the optical anisotropy that results from the collagen molecular organization (32). Indeed, collagen fibrils are efficient generators for SS-pSHG due to their well-ordered structure; three-polypeptide chains wind together to form a triple helix that further self-assembles periodically into collagen fibrils. Only non-centro-symmetric and fibrillar COL-I structures, in contrast to immature and cytoplasmic COL-I, are able to generate SS-pSHG signal following multiphoton microscopy imaging (33,34). Herein, strong Strong SS-pSHG signals within nodules as well as thin alternating bright and dark structures were noticed, suggesting a highly ordered molecular arrangement (Figure 2A). To go further on the collagen organization, observations were made using PLM, allowing the observation down to the microscale of birefringent COL-I. Interestingly, thin alternating bright and dark bands were observed locally within bone-like\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n8\nnodules (Figure 2B) and were surrounded by micrometric and birefringent crystals reminding the morphology of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate from the ioM substrate. After a 45° rotation of the polarizers, extinction of the light occurred in areas where collagen molecules lie down parallel to the direction of the polarizers, indicating a twisted plywood organization (i.e. cholesteric) of collagen fibrils (Figure 2C and 2D). Notice that the birefringent texture (Figure 2E) was not due to folds of the histological section that might occur when placed on the glass slide. Plywood geometry was further confirmed by using a quartz first order retardation plate (Figure 2F) displaying blue and yellow interference colourscolors, depending on the orientation of the collagen fibrils. Such pattern is described in osteons of human compact bone (35) and in collagen/apatite bone-like matrix (36). Infrared spectroscopic imaging has been used to describe changes in bone as functions of age, disease, fracture, and osteoporosis treatment (11). Infrared microscopy (µ-IR) was already used to examine sections of bone, providing spatially detailed information relative to mineral and organic composition (11–13). Herein, µ-IR was performed on 28 days-old air-dried bone-like nodules, avoiding interferences in the spectra due to the chosen method of fixation (37). Recorded spectra in transmission mode highlighted differences in the spectral IR fingerprint from the periphery and the central areas (Figure 3A). Band wavenumbers were determined by the calculation of the second derivative spectra (Figure SI-2) and their assignments, in accordance with the literature, are gathered in Table 1 (38–43). In the 1,000-1,160 cm -1\nregion, PO4\nstretching, features of hydroxyapatite, were clearly observed at the nodule periphery (Figure 3Aa and 3Ad, Table 1). In this mode, the infrared beam crosses the whole sample, including the substrate. Thus, the detected inorganic phosphate could be assigned to the ioM substrate (26). The central area of the nodule revealed additional bands assigned to polysaccharidespolysaccharide compounds (1,161; 1,155; 1,116; 1,108 and 1,048 cm -1 ) and\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n9\nnucleic acids (1,090 cm -1\n, Figure 3Ab and 3Ac). For bands mainly assigned to proteins (1,700-\n1,500 cm -1 ), the spectral features were also different from the center to the periphery areas of the nodule, especially for the amide-I band, known to be sensitive to the protein conformation. While the nodule periphery showed the simplest amide bands profile (Figure 3Aa and 3Ad), the shape of amide-I bands, resulting from the central area, showed a different distribution of individual amide bands (Figure 3Ab and 3Ac). Amide-I bands at the periphery were poorly resolved and centered close to 1,650 cm -1 , showing mostly proteins with random coils and/or -helices and few proteins with -sheets (Figures 3Aa 3Ad, SI-3, Table 1). The small shoulder observed at 1,687 cm -1 suggests the occurrence of a small amount of collagen. The amide-I band close to 1,660 cm -1 , associated with the one close to 1,690 cm -1 in mature collagen, was not resolved (38,41) (Figure SI-3a and SI-3d). Clearly resolved collagen amide-I bands (at 1,685~1,660, Figure SI-3b and SI3c) of the central area indicate the presence of a more mature collagen. These results are consistent with Ghita et al., who analysedanalyzed the spatial distribution of the mature bone matrix showing nodule central parts with higher maturation degree along with crystalline hydroxyapatite, whereas immature ECM was dominant at the edges of bone-like nodules (44). The presence of polysaccharide bands, between 1,160 and 1,000 cm -1\n(Figure 3Ab and 3Ac),\nsuggests the occurrence of carbohydrate moieties from collagen with also the possible presence\nof glycoproteins and/or proteoglycans, such as OCN (45). Regardless of the area, -sheets structures were observed at ~1,635-1,637 cm -1 and 1,516-1,521 cm -1 , whereas -turns can be suggested from the shoulder at 1,678 cm -1 . The proportion of collagen was also calculated from the ratio {1,660+1,690}/amide-I, and the results showed a ratio of ~ 0.1 in the peripheral areas of the nodule (Figure 3Aa, 3Ad, SI-3a and SI-3d) and ~ 0.6 from the spectra recorded in more central areas (Figure 3Ab, 3Ac, SI-3b and SI-3c). These data indicate that collagen was in higher\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n10\nquantitythere was a higher quantity of collagen in the central areas. Ratio of integrated intensities for the bands at ~1,660 and ~1,690 cm -1 (1,660/1,690), called “collagen maturity”, indicated changes in secondary structure of collagen in relation with the mineralization process (46). The collagen band at ~1,660 cm -1 was not resolved in the spectra from the peripheral areas of the nodule, signature of an immature collagen (Figure SI-3a and SI-3d). The ratios calculated from the spectra of the nodule central areas varied from 0.9 to 1.5 (Figure SI-3b and SI-3c, respectively). These disparities are probably in direct relationship with the higher amount of collagen in the nodule’s central areas with respect to the peripheral areas. Other ratios, as “mineral maturity” (ratio 1,030/1,110) or “mineralization index” (ratio 1,184-910/1,712-1,592) (46) were not calculated because of the non-negligible contribution of the phosphate species from the ioM substrate. To overcome the undesirable contribution of the ioM substrate, spectra were recorded in reflexionreflection mode on the same nodule/area, showing different general profiles with the absence of the phosphate fingerprint (i.e. around 1,030 cm -1 for the most intense band, Figure 3B). This could be explained by the fact that in this mode, the nodule is not entirely crossed by the infrared beam and that the resulting information comes mainly from the upper side of the nodule. The amide-I and -II bands, mainly observed at 1,692-1,695 cm -1 and 1,558-1,568 cm -1 , respectively, were respectively assigned to collagen. Amide-I and amide-II bands at 1,675-1,681 cm -1 and 1,521-1,524 cm -1 , were attributed to proteins with -turn conformation and -structures, respectively (Figure 3Be and 3Bf). Band at 1,660-1,665 cm -1 , usually assigned to 3-turn helix component from collagen, was correlated to pre-osteoblast differentiation into osteoblasts (41). Herein, this band was only resolved in the spectrum of the central area (Figure 3Bf and SI-3f), confirming the presence of collagen with a very low maturity stage in the peripheral areas (Figure\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n11\n3Be and 3Bg). With calculated ratios {1,660+1,690}/amide-I of about 0.4, 0.6, and 0.3 (Figure SI3e, SI-3f and SI-3g, respectively), the proportion of collagen was higher in the center area of the nodule, strengthening the above conclusion. The value of 1,660/1,690 ratio was about 0.4 (Figure SI-3f). Taken together and compared to the above results recorded in the transmission mode, these results confirm the presence of immature collagen at the top of the nodule. Amide-I bands were accompanied by bands at 1,747 and 1,721-1,723 cm -1 that are assigned mostly to C=O stretching modes of esters and carboxylic acids, respectively. These bands, either associated with phospholipids and proteins, were in our study more intense in our study than usually seen in spectra of cells. This can be attributed to the occurrence of matrix vesicle membranes involved in bone mineralization (3,47). Amide-II band, observed as a shoulder at 1,610 cm -1 , was assigned to side-chain groups of collagen, where arginine, glutamic and aspartic acids collagen residues absorbabsorption occurs (48–50). The occurrence of a large amount of collagen was also confirmed by the presence of its specific amide III band at 1,341-1,343 cm -1 (43). µ-IR in transmission and reflexionreflection modes gathered complementary information, showing a nonmature collagen at the top and the periphery of the nodule and an overall more mature collagen within the bone-like nodule. Indeed, during osteoblastic differentiation, multi-layered osteoblasts are thought to deposit an immature nodule matrix through their basal pole (3), in full agreement with our observations. One of the main limitations of conventional µ-IR being the spatial resolution; an innovative approach using atomic force microscope coupled with infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) was used to provide chemical information with a spatial resolution of ≥ 50 nm (20). By placing the AFM probe on an identified region, it is then possible to acquire a localized IR spectrum at a spatial resolution of a few tens of nm. This technique is currently used for the nanoscale analysis of anisotropic materials, including large molecules and proteins. Owing to possible nonlinearities in\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n12\nenergy absorption across samples of different thickness, AFM-IR spectra were herein recorded on histological 5 μm sections placed on a transparent and total internal reflective surface (i.e., zinc selenide). Spectra of the “cell rich” or “collagen rich” areas in the 28 days-old nodule, identified through HES staining, were recorded (Figure 4). Band wavenumbers were determined by the calculation of the second derivative spectra (Figure SI-4), and bands assignments are gathered in Table 2 (38–41,43,51). The high intensity of the amide I band with respect to the rest of the fingerprint region matched AFM-IR spectra of pure collagen fibrils (52), suggesting a high specific orientation of proteins present within analysedanalyzed areas (53). Spectra of the “cellrich” area showed an important variety of features in amide-I region (1,700-1,600 cm -1 ), suggesting a high diversity in proteins and conformations. Spectral fingerprints of collagen (1,696, 1,664 and 1,606 cm -1 ), proteins with -turn (1,678 and 1,631 cm -1 ) and /random (1,645 cm -1 ) conformations occurred in majority, but in different proportions (Figure 4A). In addition, significant proportions of proteins with -sheets conformation (1,614, 1,515 and 1623 cm -1 ) and -turn (1,676 cm -1 ), assigned to cellular proteins, were also observed. Band assigned to C=O stretching from esters at ~1,738 cm -1\nwas high in spectra of Figure 4Aa and 4Ab, suggesting the\noccurrence of phospholipids (along with the presence of the PO2 symmetric stretching at ~1,250 cm -1\n) from the cellular membranes. In the spectrum from the “cell-rich” area (Figure 4Ac), the\nintensity of the bands at ~1,736 cm -1 assigned to C=O stretching of phospholipid esters from the cellular membrane and the amide-I band below 1,650 cm -1 had the lowest relative intensities (Figure 4Ac). The most intense band here was observed at 1,664 cm -1 and assigned to collagen, showing the close contact of cells with collagen fibrils (Figure 1E). Spectra of the “collagen-rich” area revealed highly overlapped amide-I bands leading to a very broad and poorly resolved group of bands, as it was already observed for pure collagen (52). However, owing to the second\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n13\nderivative spectra, we were able to identify collagen, proteins with -turn/-sheet and /random\nstructures. The occurrence of a significant amount of phospholipids can be suggested from bands at ~1,742 and ~1,255 cm -1 (Figure 4B, Table 2). In contrast to “cell-rich” area, spectra showed additional weak intensity bands in region 1,000-1,150 cm -1 assigned to polysaccharides. These latter suggest a signature from carbohydrate moieties of collagen (43) and/or the presence of glycoproteins. In both areas (i.e. cell-rich and collagen-rich), c Considering the strong overlapping of bands and the possible polarization effects of AFM-IR in both areas (i.e. “cellrich” and “collagen-rich”), we were not able to determine unambiguously ratios 1,660/1,690 cm -1 and further collagen maturation."

      "text" : "In summary, spatially resolved spectra were recorded with µ-IR and AFM-IR techniques on bone-like nodules. They provided a reliable characterization of their chemical content, marked by\nprominent signatures from collagen, proteins with -turn/-sheet and /random structures,\nphospholipids and polysaccharides. Depending on the analysedanalyzed areas (i.e. periphery vs central areas and “cell-rich” vs “collagen-rich” areas), we noticed strong differences in spectral profiles. Such discrepancy can be attributed to the heterogeneous cell repartition within the ECM but also to the ECM components contribution including their chemical composition, molecules orientation/conformation, maturation degree etc. (Tables 1 and 2). Herein, COL-I fibrils were evidenced as the major component of the nodule. The amide-I band, typically observed in the 1,600-1,700 cm -1 range, is the most intense absorption band in collagen and is directly related to the backbone conformation. SS-pSHG and PLM showed the presence of a matured COL-I, that was partially confirmed by infrared spectroscopy investigations as 1,660/1,690 cm -1 ratios depend on the localisationlocalization in the nodule, and they were lower than those calculated for bone\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n14\nspecimens (i.e. ~ 2) (12,13,38,46). Using FTIR spectroscopy, 1,660/1,690 cm -1 ratio was shown to be proportional to the relative amounts of the trivalent cross-link pyridinoline and the divalent (immature) cross-link dihydroxylysinonorleucine (54). The intermolecular cross-linking affordsoffers to the fibrillar collagen mechanical properties such as tensile strength and viscoelasticity. Constant ECM remodellingremodeling is expected to introduce changes in their supra organizational properties, influencing this ratio (55). Notably, the marked presence of metalloproteinase in our bone-like nodules forming cells media could be a signature of ECM remodellingremodeling (data not shown). Although Gourion-Arsiquaud et al., reported that the 1,660/1,690 cm -1 ratio determined by AFM-IR indicates the collagen maturity (23), this point could be discussed. Indeed, crystallinity and orientation in the sample probed by AFM-IR systems using polarized light could influence relative IR peak intensities. SS-pSHG and PLM microscopies indicated highly ordered and oriented collagen fibers within the nodule. Thus, the undesirable effect of polarization cannot be ignored. In bone, N N-linked glycoproteins such as DMP-1 and BSP, bind to COL-I and initiate conformational changes from random coil to β-sheet structures that are able to sequester Ca 2+ ions (56). Owing to its flexible random coil and β-turn structures, OPN in contrast, is in contrast considered as a potent inhibitor of mineralization caused by the production of an electrostatic repulsion of inorganic phosphate ions (56). Through\nits -carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues, OCN, the most abundant non-collagenous protein\nfound in bone, binds to calcium and exhibits a compact calcium dependent -helical\nconformation, promoting thus the fixation of absorption to hydroxyapatite crystals to in the bone matrix and the regulation of mineralization process. Note that vibrational spectroscopic analysis of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans is not discriminant between different species.\nRegarding the importance of β-sheet, β-turn and -helical structures in bone\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n15\nmineralisationmineralization, the following band ratios were calculated: (a) -turn\nstructures/amide-I, (b) -sheet structures/amide-I, (c) -helix structures + random coil\nstructures/amide-I. The obtained results did not allow to highlighthighlighting meaningful differences between analysedthe analyzed areas whatever the spectral resolution. Lipids are described as nucleators for collagen fibrils mineralization in vitro and they are also part of the matrix vesicle membranes in bone mineralization (3,47). The occurrence of the high amount of phospholipids was likely attributed to matrix vesicles. Most reports state that successful osteoblast commitment occurs when the produced ECM is positive to alizarin red or von Kossa staining. Despite the positive staining (Figure 2D and 2E), ultrastructural and spectroscopy investigations did not show the presence of minerals. Conclusions drawn from alizarin red are probably not related to bone minerals (hydroxyapatite) but to dystrophic minerals resulting from culture media or necrotic cells, known to promote inappropriate mineralization (57,58). Finally, we recently reported that chromatin condensation iswas highly correlated with the state of differentiation with less condensatedcondensed chromatin organization in stem cell nuclei compared to localized hypercondensatedhypercondensed chromatin in differentiated cell nuclei (26). Thus, the absence of important vibrational signal of nuclei acids could be attributed to the hypercondensatedhypercondensed region in cell within the nodule, as condensatedcondensed DNA is known to decrease IR absorbance (59,60)."

Wharton’s jelly stem cells (WJ-SCs), enzymatically isolated, were amplified at density of 3 × 10 3 cell/cm 2 in α-MEM culture medium supplemented with 10% decomplemented fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin/Amphotericin B and 1% Glutamax ® (v/v, Gibco) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C with a medium change every two days. At the fourth passage, WJ-SCs were seeded in 24-well plates at 24 × 10 3 cells/cm 2 on UV-decontaminated inorganic/organic material (ioM) (26) and glass coverslip, and maintained in culture for four weeks. Scanning electron and digital microscopy After four weeks of culture, WJ-SCs were fixed with 2.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde (Sigma Aldrich) at room temperature for 1h. Samples were dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions from 50 to 100% and desiccated in hexamethyldisilazane (Sigma Aldrich) for 10 min. After air-drying at room temperature, samples were sputtered with a thin gold–palladium film under a JEOL ion sputter JFC 1100 and viewed (at 500 × magnification) using a field emission gun-scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM) (JEOL, JSM-7900F) and with a digital microscopy (Keyence, VHX-6000). FEG-SEM images were acquired from secondary electrons at primary beam energy between 5 to 20 kV. Histological analysis Cytoplasmic, nuclear and extracellular matrix features within bone-like nodules were followed by histology. After four weeks of culture, resulting bone-like nodules were fixed in 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for one hour and dehydrated in solutions with gradually increasing concentration of ethanol content, using a Shandon Excelsior Tissue Processor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Five-micrometer thick sections were performed on paraffinembedded bone-like nodules (rotation microtome AP280, Leica Microsystems). Hematoxylin-\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n17\neosin-saffron (HES), Masson’s Trichrome, Alcian blue, Alizarin red and Von Kossa stainings were performed separately on consecutive tissue sections and on various tissue zone sections and images (at 40 × magnification) were taken using a scanner iScan Coreo AU (Roche Ò Ventana). DMP1, OCN and OPN immunolabeling Paraffin embedded bone-like nodule sections were incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal antibodies targeting OPN, OCN and DMP1 (at a 1/100 dilution in blocking buffer, Calbiochem). After DPBS multiple rinse, secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG biotinylated antibodies (Invitrogen) were used at a 1/100 dilution for 30 min at room temperature followed by Alexa 488-conjugated streptavidin at 1/2,000 dilution (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. The stained sections were mounted and imaged by laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM 710 NLO, 20× objective). Transmission electron microscopy After four weeks of culture, WJ-SCs were rinsed with cacodylate buffer solution (125 mM), fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 50 mM cacodylate buffer at pH 7.4 for 2h at room temperature and finally post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 125 mM cacodylate buffer for 30 min. Samples were dehydrated in solutions with gradually increasing concentration of ethanol for 15 min. Samples were then embedded in epoxy resin (48.2% epon 812, 34% anhydride nadic methyl, 16.4% anhydride [2-dodecenyl] succinic, and 1.5% 2,4,6-tris dimethylaminoethyl] phenol) for 48h at 60 °C. After resin polymerization, a thermic shock in liquid nitrogen was first performed to remove the substrate. To obtain transversal sections of embedded samples, the cutting surface was reoriented by preparing a small block using a circular saw (Bronwill Scientific) and sticking them on new ones. Ultra-thin cross sections (100 nm in thickness) were performed using an automatic ultra-microtome (Ultracut-E Ultramicrotome, Reichert Jung). The specimen was observed with a transmission electron microscope EM208\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n18\n(FEI CompagnyCompany, Philips) operating with an accelerating voltage of 70 kV. Images were captured on SO163 Kodak films. Atomic force microscopy A Multimode-8 AFM setup from Bruker (Santa Barbara, USA) using PeakForce tapping mode in air was used in order to obtain high quality topographical images. Such an operational mode is capable to control with high-accuracy the tip-sample interaction forces with high-accuracy, therefore significantly improving the AFM image quality compared to the standard intermittent contact AFM modes. Scanning rates of 0.5 to 1 Hz were used with a constant actuation frequency of 1 kHz, all AFM images were acquired with a resolution of 512 × 512 data points. Silicon ScanAsyst-Air triangular AFM probes from Bruker (Santa Barbara, USA) with ultra-sharp tips (nominal tip radius of curvature of 2 nm, nominal spring constant of 0.4 N/m, and nominal resonance frequency of 70 kHz) were used in order to minimize non-desirable tip-sample broadening effects and to allow high-resolution topographical AFM measurements. Single Scan polarization-resolved Second Harmonic Generation imaging SS-pSHG images were obtained with a confocal microscope (LSM 710-NLO, Carl Zeiss SAS, Germany) coupled with CHAMELEON femtosecond Titanium-Sapphire Laser (Coherent, USA). Laser polarization was changed on circular by adding a λ/4 waveplate on lightpathlight path. Paraffin embedded bone-like nodule sections were excited at 860 nm and SHG signal was collected through a 20 × objective (ON: 0.8). Polarized light microscopy Observations were performed on unstained paraffin embedded bone-like nodule sections using a transmission Zeiss AxioImager A2 POL. The microscope iswas equipped with the standard accessories for examination of birefringent samples under polarized light (i.e. crossed polars and a quartz first order retardation plate) and an AxioCam CCD camera.\nJournal Pre-proof\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\n19"

A KBr beam splitter and a MCT detector were used. The resolution of the single beam spectra was 4 cm -1 . Spectra of bone-like nodules were recorded in transmission and reflectancereflection modes. Masks of 40 µm × 40 µm and 80 µm × 80 µm were used to record the transmission and reflectance spectra, respectively. The sizes of the masks were chosen to get enough energy at the detector in order to record reliable spectra with good signal-to-noise ratios. The number of bidirectional double-sided interferogram scans was 64 and 128, respectively, which corresponded to a 60 and 120 sec accumulation, respectively. All interferograms were Fourier-processed using the power phase correction and a Blackman-Harris three-term apodization function. Measurements were performed at 21 ± 1°C in an air-conditioned room. Water vapourvapor subtraction was performed when necessary, and the baseline was corrected at 3,800, 2,500, 1,900 and 900 cm -1 before further analysis of the spectra. The second derivative spectra were used to determine the number and position of the bands in region 1,750-1,500 cm -1 for the subsequent spectral curve fitting with Gaussian curves. Atomic force microscopy combined to nano-infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) Measurements on sections of paraffin-embedded nodules were performed using a NanoIR2 microscope (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) at ambient temperature in a spectral range of 1,800-900 cm -1 with a spectral resolution of 4 cm -1 . The IR laser source used for these measurements iswas an OPO laser (EKSPLA, Vilnius, Lithuania) with 12 ns long pulses and a repetition rate of 10 Hz.

While the system iswas operated in contact mode, the cantilever deflection will oscillates with an amplitude which is proportional to the absorption coefficient of the sample (20) correspondenting to the pulsed laser wavelength. Samples were placed on ZnSe sampling flats for NanoIR2. Prior to analysis, the spectrum of paraffin recorded separately was removed by spectral subtraction (Figure SI-5). Subsequent to AFM-IR data acquisition and in order to distinguish the “cell-rich” area from the “collagen-rich” area, bone-like nodule tissue sections were stained with HES using standard procedures (please refer to histological analysis section) and imaged at 40 × magnification."
