However, toxicological data available for the interaction between NPs and NAOP remain limited. Here, we investigate the toxicological effects of three model polystyrene (PS) NPs with different functional groups (unmodified, amino- and carboxyl-modified PS NPs) on two freshwater organisms of different trophic levels (Scenedesmus obliquus and Danio rerio) in the absence and presence of two classes of NAOP, namely fulvic acid and humic acid. The NAOP interaction with the NPs is shown to alter oxidative stress and disturb membrane function in S. obliquus cells to a certain extent. Combined oxidative stress responses to the NPs and NAOP in D. rerio as a function of their mixture levels showed inhibition, alleviation, and reinforce. Changes in cellular oxidative stress and membrane function depended on the concentration and types of both NPs and NAOP. Furthermore, the characterization parameters of the NPs were important for the explanation of the ecotoxicological mechanism of the NPs in the presence of NAOP. Our findings emphasized the critical role of NAOP in the fate and toxicity of plastic particles in freshwater environment."

      "text" : "Plastic as a group of material on the consumer market is hazardous to aquatic ecosystem including marine and freshwater environments (Arias-Andres et al., 2018; Jambeck et al., 2015; Scott-Fordsmand et al., 2017). Large plastic items tend to fragment into micro-plastic particles (MPs) (< 5mm) and nano-plastic particles (NPs) (< 1 μm) under exposure of continuous crushing, UV radiation, and biodegradation (Gigault et al., 2018; Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012; Lambert and Wagner, 2016). MP and NP debris are diffused worldwide and deposited along the coastal regions driven by ocean currents, tides, and so on (Browne et al., 2011; Li et al., 2016; Mai et al., 2018). In addition, NPs can adsorb organic chemicals and metal compounds as a carrier and become more ingestible and high-efficiently bioavailable due to their hydrophobicity and enormous surface area (Alimi et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018; Velzeboer et al., 2014).\nIn freshwater environment, plastic contamination not only threatens the survival of marine life (Capolupo et al., 2018; Dawson et al., 2018; Lo and Chan, 2018; Wang et al., 2018), but also affects the growth and behavior of freshwater organisms (Chae and An, 2017; Manfra et al.,\n2017; Sharma and Chatterjee, 2017). Recently, more attention has been paid to toxicological effects of NPs on freshwater organisms (Brun et al., 2017; Cole and Galloway, 2015; Della Torre et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2016; Rist et al., 2017). For instance, it has been demonstrated that NPs reduced population growth of Scenedesmus obliquus (Besseling et al., 2014) and induced abnormal embryonic development in Daphnia galeata (Cui et al., 2017). Polystyrene (PS) NPs adhered to the surface of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii from the primary producer and accumulated in the digestive organs of Oryzias sinensis from a higher trophic level species (Chae et al., 2018). When ingested by Danio rerio via different exposure channels, PS NPs can accumulate on specific organs and tissues throughout development (Pitt et al., 2018; Van Pomeren et al., 2017). Furthermore, the existence of NPs in Danio rerio can inhibit larval locomotion and acetylcholinesterase activity, significantly reduce larvae body length, and increase BPA bioavailability and cause neurotoxicity in adult zebrafish (Chen et al., 2017a,b). In addition, Nolte et al. (2017) emphasized the surface modification of NPs and medium hardness is helpful to explain the toxicity of NPs to green algae. Despite the above progress to date, the studies on toxicological effects of NPs on freshwater organisms are limitedly investigated only in individual\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2019.01.007 Received 24 September 2018; Received in revised form 23 December 2018; Accepted 18 January 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author.

Natural acidic organic polymer (NAOP) is ubiquitous in natural aquatic and terrestrial environment and affects the fate and effects of engineering nanomaterials in the environment (Afshinnia et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Lowry et al., 2012; Oriekhova and Stoll, 2018; Wang et al., 2015). It has been found that NAOP has a dual impact on the aggregation of PS NPs, depending on the ionic strength of FeCl3 solution (Cai et al., 2018). However, current knowledge about the impacts of NAOP on the aquatic toxicity of NPs is extremely limited.\nThe present study intends to investigate the ecotoxicological effects of three model PS NPs with different functional groups (unmodified, amino- and carboxyl-modified PS NPs) on two freshwater organisms of different trophic levels (S. obliquus and D. rerio) in the absence and presence of two classes of NAOP, namely fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA). More specifically, our study aims (1) to evaluate the aqueous stability of the NPs in the model freshwater media, (2) to explore the impacts of NAOP on algal cellular growth, membrane disruption, and oxidative stress induced by the NPs, and (3) to elucidate the impacts of NAOP on fish embryonic oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation induced by the NPs."

Ltd were selected as the two analogies of NAOP.\nAlgae medium (OECD, 2011) and embryo medium (E3) was freshly prepared before each test.

Two physicochemical characterization parameters, namely zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter, were determined for the NP suspensions at 1mg/L in the absence and presence of NAOP at 0 h and 96 h after incubation in the test media. The physicochemical analysis was performed using a ZetaSizer instrument (Nano ZS90, Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, UK). The stock solution of FA or HA was prepared by dissolving 100mg/L in high purity water and by stirring for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Afterward, the stock solution was filtered through a syringe filter with the pore diameter of 0.22 μm. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content in the prepared stock solution was determined by a total organic carbon analyzer (Shimadzu Corporation). pH of all the treatments was stable at approximately 7.9 in the algae medium and 7.6 in the embryo medium, respectively."

Two different concentrations of 0.5 and 5 mgC/L representing typical surface and groundwater concentrations of dissolved organic matters were selected (Li et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2015). Following the OECD 201 algal growth-inhibition test guidelines (OECD, 2011) with slight modifications, the exponentially growing algae cells were re-suspended in the algae medium to obtain an initial concentration of 3×105 cells/mL (by counting in a Fuchs-Rosenthal chamber) for the exposure of NPs. Each concentration was performed in triplicate. All flasks were consistently incubated in an artificial growth chamber for 96 h at a temperature of 24 ± 1 °C with a 12/12-h light/dark cycle. Additionally, all the flasks during the exposure experiment were shaken three times per day manually. The algal cell density measure was used to calculate the specific growth rate (%). Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cell membrane permeability (CMP) of S. obliquus were measured by following Liu et al. (2008) with slight modifications. The detailed experimental procedures were described in the Supplementary data.\nThe embryonic toxicity test was conducted according to OECD Guideline 236 (OECD, 2013). Twenty-four Danio rerio eggs were transferred into a 24-well multi-well plate such that each well contained one embryo. Twenty wells were filled with exposure treatment solution (2mL) and remaining four wells were filled with embryo medium (2mL) to act as internal plate controls. Moreover, 24 eggs in the embryo medium as negative control on one plate. All of the wells were covered with a transparent plastic cap and incubated in an artificial growth chamber for 96 h at 26 ± 1 °C with a 12/12-h light/dark photoperiod. The development status of embryos and larvae was observed and documented photographically at 96 h with an optical microscope (magnification objectives 40×). Each concentration was performed twice in an independent experiment.\nOxidative stress is an appropriate endpoint when assessing the\ntoxicity of nanoparticles (Nel et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2018). Oxidative stress biomarker assays including the quantitative analysis and qualitative tracking of ROS, as well as the measurement of the antioxidant activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) are described in the Supplementary data."

      "text" : "According to the analysis of XPS measurement, the PS, APS, and CPS NPs surfaces consisted of 59.93% C/39.39% O/0.68% N, 63.19% C/ 30.49% O/6.31% N, and 55.87% C/43.56% O/0.57% N, respectively. The morphology of the three NPs at the concentration of 1mg/L in the algae medium and embryo medium is presented in Fig. S1. The TEM images revealed spherical shaped NPs with a smooth surface. In the media, the NPs dispersed in the form of both individual particles and agglomerates. The reason for the formation of agglomerates may be due to the presence of divalent cations (e.g. Ca2+, Mg2+) in the media, which might compress the electric double layer structure of particles and induce agglomeration (Cosgrove, 2005).\nFig. S2 shows the variation of the zeta potential of the three NPs at the concentration of 1mg/L in the absence and presence of FA or HA over time in the algae medium and embryo medium. The zeta potential measurements indicated that the three NPs were negatively charged. A\nprevious study has also shown that nano-plastic (polystyrene) particles were found to be negative at low concentration in natural water (Oriekhova and Stoll, 2018). The presence of NAOP altered the zeta potential of the NPs to a certain extent, dependently of the NP surface modification, the concentration and types of NAOP, the types of test media, as well as incubation time.\nFig. S3 presents the variation of the hydrodynamic diameter of the three NPs at the concentration of 1mg/L in the absence and presence of FA and HA with time in the test media. In the algae medium, the NAOP slightly increased the hydrodynamic diameter values of the PS and CPS NPs, while the NAOP did not significantly alter the hydrodynamic diameter values of the APS NPs. In the embryo medium, the hydrodynamic diameter values of the NPs without and with the NAOP did not significantly change over time. In addition, no significant sedimentation phenomena were observed under this study, as Fig. S4 presented. In general, these particles at the concentration of 1mg/L in the absence or presence of the NAOP appeared stable suspension in the test medium."

      "heading" : "3.2. Toxicological effects of NPs on S. obliquus in the presence of FA or HA",
      "text" : "Growth rates of S. obliquus exposed to the NPs in the absence and presence of FA or HA are shown in Fig. S5. Generally, the NPs at 1 μg/L and 1mg/L showed no significant growth inhibition effects on the algae. Moreover, the 1 μg/L PS stimulated the growth of algae cells when HA was present at 0.5 mgC/L. Besseling et al. (2014) also found that PS NPs at a high concentration of 1 g/L showed approximately 2.5% growth inhibition of S. obliquus, and PS NPs at below 100mg/L did not reduce Chlorophyll-a concentration. Therefore, we conclude that the studied NPs displayed very low growth inhibition toxicity to\nthe algae. It is reported that ROS can be responsible for much of the physiological damage caused by nanoparticles (Shang et al., 2017; Ye et al., 2018). As shown in Fig. 1A, 1mg/L PS or APS alone treatments showed a significantly (p < 0.05) higher ROS level in S. obliquus compared with the control. Bhattacharya et al. (2010) also found that charged PS NPs promoted algal ROS production. However, the presence of FA or HA caused a decrease of the ROS level of the PS and APS at 1mg/L to the normal level. It was also found that the CPS at 1 μg/L induced a significant increase in the ROS level when 5 mgC/L FA and 0.5 mgC/L HA were present. Moreover, by the presence of 0.5 mgC/L FA and 5 mgC/L HA, the ROS level of the CPS at 1mg/L was significantly enhanced. Note that 5 mgC/L FA alone treatment significantly elevated the ROS level (p < 0.05), implying that an increase in oxidative stress occurring in the algal cells exposed to the combination of FA and CPS may be associated with the isolated FA in the mixtures. These findings point out that the NPs are prone to display oxidative stress response in the algal cellular system depending on their particle concentrations, NAOP types, and DOC concentrations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the effects of NAOPs on the cellular oxidative stress in the algae caused by the NPs.\nIn order to protect cells against the adverse effects of ROS, SOD can maintain steady-state levels of ROS in cells (Weckx and Clijsters, 1996). The SOD activities induced by engineered nanoparticles were frequently assessed for freshwater green microalgae (Rico et al., 2013; Roy et al., 2016). As shown in Fig. 1B, the algal cells exposed to 1mg/L PS, 1 μg/L and 1mg/L APS, as well as 1 μg/L and 1mg/L CPS alone treatments, showed a higher SOD activity than the control. The increase in the SOD activity demonstrated the production of superoxide radical (O2−) and an increase in ROS scavenging. However, to some extent, the\npresence of FA or HA alleviated the SOD activity of the algal cells exposed to the NPs, particularly note that the PS inhibited the SOD activity when the HA was present. The data indicated that in the algal cells, on co-exposure to the NPs and HA, a decrease in the activity of SOD resulted in an inefficient removal of O2−. For 1mg/L APS and CPS, 0.5 mgC/L HA and FA significantly enhanced the SOD activity, respectively. This is totally in agreement with the findings for the increase of the ROS level (Fig. 2A and B). In addition, 5 mgC/L FA and HA alone treatments induced a significant increase in the SOD activity in comparison with the control, implying that the isolated NAOP contributed to the increase of the SOD activity of the algal cells exposed to the binary systems of 1 μg/L APS+ 5 mgC/L FA, 1 μg/L CPS+5 mgC/L FA, and 1mg/L CPS+5 mgC/L HA.\nMitochondria play central roles in the oxidative energy metabolism as well as apoptosis by integrating death signals (Brenner and Kroemer, 2000; Liu et al., 2008). The interruption of mitochondrial function may account for the impairment of algal cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, the NP alone treatments did not alter the MMP significantly. However, the binary systems of 0.5 mgC/L HA and NPs generally affected MMP more than the individual 0.5 mgC/L HA and NPs, implying that NPs interrupted cellular MMP of S. obliquus in the presence of HA at low concentration. Similar phenomena results were observed for the 1 μg/L PS+5 mgC/L FA, 1mg/L PS+ 5 mgC/L HA, and 1mg/L APS+ 5 mgC/L FA. The significant increase in MMP in the algal cells indicated damage to mitochondrial function.\nModifying the permeability of cell membrane could play an important role in mediating the adverse effects of environmental contaminants on freshwater algae (Liu et al., 2008). As shown in Fig. 2B, the NP alone treatments had no significant effects on the CMP of S. obliquus with the exception of 1 μg/L CPS. The FA only and FA+1 μg/L\nCPS obviously inhibited the CMP, while HA+PS, 0.5 mgC/L HA+1 mg/L APS, 1 μg/L CPS, and 0.5 mgC/L HA+CPS significantly increased the CMP. The enhancement of permeability could increase the uptake ability of the NPs and pose a serious risk to the algae. Furthermore, the enhancement of CMP to other concomitant pollutants, some more toxic than the NPs, could pose a serious risk to a unicellular alga that is exposed directly to pollutants in the aquatic environment (Liu et al., 2008)."

      "text" : "Survival rates of D. rerio exposed to the NPs in the absence and presence of FA or HA are shown in Fig. S6. Generally, the NPs in the absence and presence of FA or HA showed no acute toxicity to D. rerio except the binary mixtures of 1mg/L PS+5 mgC/L HA. As shown in Fig. 3A, the treatments except 1 μg/L, 1mg/L APS+5 mgC/L FA, and 1mg/L APS+0.5 mgC/L HA significantly promoted the generation of ROS compared to the control. In general, the ROS level induced by the NPs in the presence of FA or HA was greater than that induced by the NPs and NAOP alone treatments. This implies that the ROS level of NPs was synergistically increased in the presence of NAOP. The extent of increase was associated with the NAOP concentrations. Particularly, for 1mg/L PS, increasing the NAOP concentrations increased the ROS level. However, for 1 μg/L APS, increasing the NAOP concentrations decreased the ROS level. Moreover, note that the presence of NAOP obviously decreased the ROS level induced by 1mg/L APS. It can be concluded that surface modification plays an important role in oxidative stress effects induced by the NPs in the presence of NAOP. It is known that the toxicity of plastic nanoparticles to aquatic organisms as influenced by surface modification (Bergami et al., 2017; Nolte et al.,\n2017). Additionally, the SOD activity significantly increased when 5 mgC/L HA, 1 μg/L APS in the presence of 5 mgC/L FA and HA, and 1mg/L CPS in the presence of FA compared to the control (Fig. 3B). This implies that these treatments presented a significant impact on enzymatic antioxidant defense in D. rerio.\nThe intracellular ROS accumulation induced by the 1mg/L NPs in the absence and presence of 5 mgC/L FA and HA was also measured (Fig. 4). The treatment groups for D. rerio exhibited a higher level of fluorescence compared with the control group, implying that more ROS had accumulated in D. rerio. Note that the level of fluorescence induced by 1mg/L APS+5 mgC/L FA approached to the control. This is in agreement with the quantitative results of the ROS level. It was also\nfound that the FA and HA alone treatments showed a higher level of fluorescence. This means that FA and HA at a higher concentration also contributed to the ROS accumulation in D. rerio.\nThe roles of the physicochemical properties (zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameters) of the particle-induced oxidative stress were evaluated when FA and HA were absent and present after 96 h, as shown in Fig. 5. It is interesting to notice that there is a high correlation between the ROS difference of test and control groups in S. obliquus and D. rerio exposed to the PS and APS in the presence of FA and HA and the zeta potential of the NPs. Moreover, the ROS difference of test and control groups increased with decreasing the zeta potential of the NPs. This also means that the NPs carrying more surface charge induced\nmore ROS levels. In addition, a negative correlation was observed between the ROS or SOD difference of test and control groups and the hydrodynamic diameters of the particles in the presence of NAOP (Fig. 5), namely that the ROS or SOD difference of test and control groups increased with decreasing the hydrodynamic diameters of the NPs. This implies that the NPs with smaller agglomerated sizes were pone to show more severe oxidative stress effects. Previous studies also suggested that smaller PS beads may have more negative effects on aquatic organisms (Jeong et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2016). Hence, it can be concluded that the mechanism of NAOP affecting the ecotoxicological effects of the NPs may be responsible for the NAOP ability to alter the physicochemical properties of the NPs."

The changes in oxidative stress and cellular membrane function were associated with the concentration and types of NAOP added and the concentration and surface modification of the polystyrene NPs. Furthermore, the mechanism of the NAOP impacts on the aquatic toxicities of the NPs to S. obliquus and D. rerio could mainly be explained by the zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameters of the suspended particles. This study could shed light on the fate and effects of polystyrene NPs when NAOP coexisted in natural water.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors claim no conflict of interests.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41601519) and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20150891 and BK20170948)."

However, toxicological data available for the interaction between NPs and NAOP remain limited. Here, we investigate the toxicological effects of three model polystyrene (PS) NPs with different functional groups (unmodified, aminoand carboxyl-modified PS NPs) on two freshwater organisms of different trophic levels (Scenedesmus obliquus and Danio rerio) in the absence and presence of two classes of NAOP, namely fulvic acid and humic acid. The NAOP interaction with the NPs is shown to alter oxidative stress and disturb membrane function in S. obliquus cells to a certain extent. Combined oxidative stress responses to the NPs and NAOP in D. rerio as a function of their mixture levels showed inhibition, alleviation, and reinforce. Changes in cellular oxidative stress and membrane function depended on the concentration and types of both NPs and NAOP. Furthermore, the characterization parameters of the NPs were important for the explanation of the ecotoxicological mechanism of the NPs in the presence of NAOP. Our findings emphasized the critical role of NAOP in the fate and toxicity of plastic particles in freshwater en-",
