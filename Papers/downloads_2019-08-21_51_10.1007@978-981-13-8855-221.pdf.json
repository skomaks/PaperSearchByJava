Consequently, in 2050, the aged population is estimated to be around 1.6 billion in developing countries, thus resulting in enormous socioeconomic and political impacts. The aging process at a rapid rate and with the baby boomer generation at the geriatric doorstep will continue to set the trend for the next 30 years [2].\nMoreover, an increase in the longevity of humans and their dynamic migration into different parts of the world will result in an increased demand on the health sector with questions to health-care provisions and costs as well as the health needs of the elderly and the migrating populations [2]. As a consequence of this normal aging process and migration, the increase in life-long exposure to environmental and chemical agents that results in modifications in the natural microbiome, is the primary reason behind the worldwide increase in chronic diseases. These phenomena which affect the elderly, contributes to their disability and reduces their quality of life [3]. Additionally, in our current society and in an age where we are greatly influenced by the environment and social media, there is also a growing concern about our body appearance. Understanding and mapping out the interactions between human beings and their environment is therefore a huge task, like the mapping of human and non-human microbiome. For these reasons, the effects of UV and IR radiation, tobacco smoke, ozone, pollutions caused by nanoparticles inside and outside our homes have also received an increasing amount of attention (Fig. 21.2). Through the combined efforts of innovative and challenging research studies, we are discovering ways to slow down premature skin aging and diseases. These phenomena have created a further challenge for the healthcare system and society, which include major investments in advanced medications to ensure innovation, quality, safety, and value in healthcare [4].\nThe need to develop innovative strategies related to for instance the prevention of skin diseases and skin cancers in our aging society involves numerous innovative and original ideas from all medical disciplines. Therefore, the development of nanotechnology-based tissue engineered novel advanced dressings and tools could assist in the skin wound healing processes and/or bone reconstruction in difficult cases. Subsequently, tissue engineering, which is based on the use of porous biodegradable scaffolds, can provide temporary support for cell growth, as these scaffolds displays the same structure as the natural extracellularmatrix (ECM) (Fig. 21.3). Such scaffolds may be produced by agglomeration of micro/nanospheres and/or micro/nanofibers made of biocompatible materials arranged into a three-dimensional (3D) structure, such as the non-woven tissues (Fig. 21.4) [5].\nMore importantly, these structures should stimulate the production of protein factors necessary for the injured bone or chronic skin wounds to heal and permitting the proper growth of new tissues. For all these reasons, the global nanotechnologybased market in advanced medications (Fig. 21.5) is expected to grow by 11–12% during the forecast period between 2012 and 2022, driven by the growth in the aging population worldwide, as well as our increased use in biomedical devices and tools, and the increase in research and development investments [6].\nThese medications must be innovative in their structure and composition and can be fabricated using non-woven tissues or films made by natural and biodegradable polymeric fibers, possibly obtained from agricultural and industrial by-products. The\nreason in using these environmental-friendly materials and processes is due to the increasing concerns regarding global warming, carbon emissions, ozone layer depletion, environmental hazards and the need to reduce waste [6, 7]. These technological advances, in fact, are set out to replace finite resources and conventional industrial processes with bio-components, obtained from renewable resources, and bio-based processes, more sustainable and emitting less CO2.\nFor this purpose, natural polymers are renewable and cheap compounds which poseminimal health hazards and can provide a solution to environmental pollution by finding new uses for waste materials [7]. Among these polymers, the most promising are polysaccharides, such as chitin and chitin-derived compounds, because of their outstanding biocompatibility and biodegradable properties, making them useful in the production of nanocomposites and scaffolds for medical applications."

      "text" : "Chitin, as the second most abundant biopolymer in nature after cellulose, is an unbranched glucose-derived compound comprising repeating monomer chains of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine [8]. The alpha form of this biopolymer, widely distributed as supporting structure in the cell wall of fungi and exoskeleton of arthropod and insects, is organized by amorphous and crystalline chains, arranged in various structural levels (Fig. 21.6) [9]. It is organized in an antiparallel fashion with highly ordered orthorhombic symmetry to form nanofibrils assembled into a honeycomb shaped array [10], similar to those observed in many human tissues (Fig. 21.7).\nAccording to Tishchenko et al. [11], the shape of chitin nanofibrils suspended in water, both in the swollen state (Fig. 21.8a, b) and in the dry state (Fig. 21.8c, d) are quite similar. These nanofibrils with a needle-like appearance are slightly longer and thinner and with mean dimensions of 240 × 7 × 5 nm (shown in Fig. 21.9). Moreover, due to their cationic characteristics, the needle-like crystallites remain suspended in water and spontaneously reorganizing their chiral nematic structures with the water molecules [12]. Their x-ray diffraction pattern has an appearance of a well-ordered crystalline phase with peaks characteristic of alpha chitin (Fig. 21.10) [11].\nInterestingly, it is important to underline how copper and silver nanostructured ions and utilized at their nanodimension, can bind on the surfaces of chitin nanofibrils without modifying their needle aspect [11], and at the same time enhances their antimicrobial activity (Fig. 21.11) [13]. In addition, it is important to describe that silver nanoparticles display the most significant antibacterial and antifungal properties and lower side-effects, which are different to the bulk silver metal [13, 14]."

      "text" : "Due to their specific characteristics of physical cross linkers, these pure and crystalline nanofibrils, being positively charged, could be separated from each other through certain technologies and used as fillers to strengthen the fiber structure of biopolymers or to make bio-based polymeric nanocomposites, as well as to produce innovative delivery carriers entrapping micro/nanoparticles, electro-negatively\nor positively charged on their surface [13, 15, 16]. These charged nanoparticles, utilized as such or entrapped into emulsions or tissues, could utilize the benefits of electrostatic attractions with cellular membranes to enhance adsorption and subsequent cellular internalization. However, the charges have different effects on skin permeation. For instance, positively charged nanoparticles are more inclined towards contact/adsorptions on the cell membranes, largely consisting of negatively charged domains, such as phospholipids with negatively charged head groups and polysulphated proteoglycans and carbohydrates found in mammalian cells [13, 15]. On the contrary, negatively charged particles will remain on the skin, covering its surface as a film."

      "text" : "With respect to their industrial production, it is important to mention that these bio-carriers can be produced simply by combining electro-positively and negatively charged micro/nanoparticles in water solution using the ionic gelation method (Fig. 21.12) [17–19]. Using this approach, based on the ability of polyelectrolytes to cross-link in the presence of counterions, it is possible to form hydrogel beads called nanocapsules or gelispheres (Fig. 21.13) [18, 20]. If necessary, this technique can be easily adjusted to achieve desired polymer/surfacemodifications so that hydrophobic and hydrophilic ingredients can be simultaneously encapsulated [17, 20]. These gelispheres is also capable of entrapping different active ingredients and, based on the type and concentration of electrolytes used, could be designed as delivery systems to ensure stability and a constant time-release rate of the entrapped ingredients [13]. According to the so-called 4R’s by Wiechers [21], “the role of a delivery system is to ensure that the right concentration of the right chemical is reaching the right site in the body for a suitable period of time”."

      "heading" : "21.2.3 Biopolymers Versus Bio-Based Polymers",
      "text" : "Fundamental characteristic of both biopolymers and bio-based polymers must be their nanoscale dimensions, biodegradability and biocompatibility [19]. Thus, while biopolymers produced by living organisms are always biodegradable, the bio-based ones, derived from renewable resources, may not necessarily be biodegradable [22]. One such example is bio-polyethylene which is obtained from biomass through polymerization of ethylene synthesized from ethanol production.\nNanocomposites, on the other hand, demonstrate significantly improved material properties in comparison to pure polymers or conventional composites. Their performances are in fact dependent on the nanoparticles used and its features such as dimensions, aspect, specific surface area-to-volume ratio, compatibility with the matrix, dispersion, and capacity to enhance the immune response [23]. As a result, it is important tomention that both chitin-nanomaterial and nanocomposites are used to manufacture innovative non-woven tissues due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and hydrating effectiveness, and skin repairing activities [7, 24, 25]. As a matter of fact, these innovating biological dressings can accelerate the healing process at both the molecular and systemic levels. Through their activities, it seems possible not only to facilitate the wound contraction, but also to regulate the secretion of inflammatory mediators, preventing hypertrophic scar formation (Fig. 21.14) [26, 27].\nAccording to our results, chitin nanofibril-lignin non-woven tissue seems to provide a three-dimensional structure that mimics the native extracellular matrix (ECM) as previously reported in Fig. 21.4, while the scaffold is being replaced by the regenerated hard tissues. Moreover, this complex can decrease the bacterial concentration, increasing the production of defensins, thus enhancing the immune response,\nand modulating both growth factors and metalloproteinases activities, while chitin nanofibrils safeguard and regulate the organization of the collagen fibers during the repair of a wounded skin (Fig. 21.15) [7, 25–28]. In summary, the chitin nanofibrillignin non-woven tissues have demonstrated the capacity to increase the cicatrizing process of people affected by wounds and burns of 1st and 2nd degree without the formation of hypertrophic scars and keloids (Fig. 21.16) [26, 27].\nSubsequently, these studies demonstrate that it appears possible to modulate the wound healing process with the aid of specific biomaterials, nanomaterials and\nnanoparticles for producing replacement-like process, rather than scar-tissue formation.\nFinally, it isworthy tomention that both lignin and chitin, being natural by-product raw materials obtained from agricultural and shellfish waste, such as banana rachis and crustacean by-products, plays a role in preserving natural resources for our next generations and maintaining the equilibrium of the earth ecosystem [6, 7]."

      "heading" : "21.3 Chitin Nanocomposites",
      "text" : "Composite materials are efficient systems made combining two constituents: the reinforcement (filler) and the matrix. They are combined in such a way that the constituents do not dissolve or merge but retain their individual engineering properties [29]. Different types of composites are currently used for a wide variety of applications. They can be classified according to the matrix and reinforcement materials such as polymer-matrix composites, metal-matrix composites, ceramic-matrix composites and carbon/carbon composites. Based on the shape, the filler composites are distinguished in particulate composites, short fiber composites and flake composites. In fiber-reinforced composites, the strong fibers, embedded in the matrix, maintains the geometric arrangement and transmit the load applied to the composite components. As a result of the manufacturing process, the composite materials will have mechanical properties superior to those of the matrix but lower than that of the fibrous reinforcement caused by the interactions between the fibers and matrices.\nBiopolymers containing cellulosemicro-fiberswere the subject of numerous studies during the last decade. Several models were developed to study the interactions between fiber andmatrix [30]. Moreover, innovative processingmethods were developed to synthesize cellulose-reinforcedmicrocomposites comprising of a high degree of renewable and recycled materials [31]. Interestingly, it was found that natural fibers show a waviness, leading to reduced improvement in properties in comparison to what was predicted using general models applied in composite sector. Hence, a corrective factor was proposed to keep into account this issue [32].\nA nanocomposite is a composite in which at least one of the reinforcement dimensions is less than 100 nm (Fig. 21.17) [33]. On the other hand, a nanomaterial is a\nmaterial containing particles, in a bound state or as an aggregate or as agglomerate in which for 50% or more of the particles in the number size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the range of 1–100 nm [29, 34]. Just to have an idea of this dimension, the smallest bacteria are about 200 nm in length and a DNA double-helix has a diameter of 2 nm. In relations to its properties, the reduced particle size within the nanocomposite promotes reinforcement-matrix interactions, due to the large surface area and short diffusion distance. This plays a significant role in determining the improvements in mechanical properties [34].\nOne of the main applications of nanotechnology in material science is the development of polymer nanocomposites, reinforced polymers with low quantity nanosized organic or inorganic ingredients dispersed into a thermoplastic or thermoset polymer. As an example, phyllosilicates-based polymer nanocomposites were manufactured using conventional routes keeping into account the polarity characteristics of polymers and clays [35]. In general, nanocomposites with polymeric matrices are reinforced with small amounts of nanoparticles typically less than 5% by mass, and their manufacturing processes require action at the matrix level to ensure greater dispersion of nanoparticles into the polymer/nanoparticle interfaces [29, 34]. Furthermore, the production of poly(lactic acid)-based nano-composites were investigated in a number of studies in which traditional processing technique [36] and innovative chemical modification routes [37] were compared and/or integrated. Due to the ever\nincreasing interest on the environmental impacts, the development of nanocomposites reinforced with natural fibers (bio-nanocomposites) is rapidly emerging.\nConsumers, in fact, are seeking biodegradable and natural ingredients which, used as drugs or cosmetics, must be effective, safe and capable of making their physical appearance better, giving them a feeling of well-being. Unfortunately, the quality of natural ingredients and fibers depends on a number of variables such as the environment where they are produced, the season, soil quality, and the location from which they originate from within the plant. However, on the one hand, these fibers are hydrophilic, incapable of withstanding high temperatures, low tensile strength, and could easily be contaminated with microorganisms; on the other, they are totally degradable through the environmental enzymes, safe and obtained at low cost.\nMoreover, regarding the issues of biodegradability, it is important to remember that once a composite is produced, it almost becomes impossible for the reinforcement to separate from the matrix [29, 34]. Consequently, with respect to the environment and the recyclability of the bio-composite, natural fibers must be used in conjunction with a biodegradable matrix, such as a biopolymer.\nFor this reason, the use of chitin and its derived compounds as a polymericmaterial is of great interest due to their availability in significant quantity from the market at low cost, being stable at high temperature with an easy modifiable surface, and totally biodegradable from humans and environmental enzymes [13, 19, 24]. This is also the reason why chitin nanofibrils have attracted particular interest (in addition to their own nanostructure, good thermal stability, non-toxicity and biocompatibility) and making this polymer a promising candidate that can be used in biomedicine for the production of non-woven tissues or biofilms using electrospinning and/or casting technologies. As previously mentioned, it is possible for instance to electrospin a gel made by chitin nanofibrils bound to silver, polypeptides from fish-collagen, and PEO using water as solvent to produce a non-woven tissue capable of regenerating skin tissue in a short amount of time (Fig. 21.18) [19, 27].\nOn the other hand, it is possible to create a slurry with chitosan and chitin nanofibrils using water and a correct plasticizer to produce a viscoelastic gel that could be used in the manufacturing of films using casting technology [11]. In this case, silver may also bound to chitin nanofibrils, to obtain films which have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties and also beneficial when used in advanced medications (Fig. 21.19) [7, 13, 25, 27].\nAs previously shown, both chitin nanofibrils-silver-non-woven tissue and the chitin nanofibrils-silver- film have displayed significant antibacterial and cicatrizing activities on burned skin in vivo. Furthermore, it was surprised to discover that films, containing practically no interfibrillary spaces, have demonstrated cell reproduction and survival also, as shown in Fig. 21.20 [11, 27].\nDuring extrusion, the nano-dispersion of chitin nanofibrils in a poly(lactic acid)based matrix was accomplished with excellent controls in both the final properties and the ability of being processed [38]. This preliminary study has demonstrated that it was possible to incorporate chitin nanofibrils in a bioplastic matrix as an attempt to exploit its functionalities in other applications such as biodegradable packaging films or containers [39]. At the moment, this is an attractive topic for any future research [25].\nFig. 21.19 Transparent film made by nanostructured chitin nanofibrils-silver"

      "text" : "The skin, as a major organ covering the human body, is a multi-layered biomembrane with essential functions and particular absorption characteristics. Through its outmost stratum corneum layer, it provides a highly efficient barrier for water, and plays an important protective function against microbial and chemical assaults. Common injuries such as wounds and burns can damage this biomembrane and the replacement of this biomembrane is necessary so that its function can be restored in the shortest time possible. Thus, skin substitutes have crucial roles, specifically in the management of deep dermal and full thickness wounds [40].\nIn fact, more than 6 million patients every year suffers from severe burns and over 0.3 million people die from these injuries worldwide [40]. Additionally, it is reported that chronic wounds affect 6.5 million patients per year in the USA and more than US$ 25 billion was spent by the healthcare system, and similarly around US$ 5 billion in UK [41]. On the other hand, osteoporosis worldwide is projected to increase by 310% in man and 240% in women by the year 2050, affecting 75 million people in EU, USA and Japan, causing more than 8.9 million fractures annually with consequent disability [42]. However, it has been estimated that surgical wounds worldwide affect for around 100 million people per year, while traumatic wounds will affect more than 50 million patients. These figures represent that the wound care industry could potentially have a turnover of around US$ 10 billion, including xenogenic tissue scaffold, dermal substitutes, etc. [43]. Thus, chronic wounds, such as venous and diabetic ulcers, for example, as well as osteoporotic fractures are growing in occurrence with our increasing aging population, and for the increasing awareness and improved diagnosis.\nMoreover, a significant feature of all the wounds—approximately 7–10%—is the likelihood of pathological infection that is the result of the procedure or treatment used [41]. Consequently, chronic wounds imposed significant burden on the individual, the healthcare system and the society as a whole. Thus, gaining an understanding into the prevalence and incidence of this category of wounds in relation to population\ncharacteristics and distribution represents an important asset for healthcare planning and resource allocation. In any case, advanced medications and tools, to achieve the best medical treatments are required and necessary as an attempt to solve this important social problem [41]. For these reasons, modern and interactive dressing products are continuously designed and programmed to actively interact with the wound bed, providing optimum environment at the wound dressing interface, maintaining hydration, and preventing infection [44, 45].\nThe presence of a wet environment is needed in wound healing because the lack of water may affect cell metabolism leading to wound drying. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that wound healing is a biological process which involves inflammation, migration, proliferation and cell maturation activated by keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which cover the wound surface as a new layer, essential during the remodeling process of skin tissues [44]. Thus, collagen for examplemust be produced in the right quantity with the fibers regularly deposed to avoid the formation of hypertrophic scars and keloids, as it has been previously shown on burned skin treatment [27].\nSimilar results have been obtained using innovative chitin nanofibrils non-woven tissues, enriched with fish-collagen peptides and nanostructured silver [19, 26, 27]. These specialized tissues, adsorbing exudates, controlling both microbiome growth and the inflammation processes and allowing the diffusion of atmospheric oxygen, have probably increased the tissue regeneration obtained by chitin nanofibrils-nonwoven tissues. Thus, the rate of skin healing and the aesthetic repair of wound have been optimized to attain a fast skin repair without infection [7, 25, 27]. Collagen if it is used in the manufacturing of specific nanofiber matrices [45], as reported by other studies, plays a key role in correcting the skin cicatrization processes, while silver could modulate the microorganism’s growth [14].\nIn conclusion, the bacterial-chitin nanofibrils-network of pure chitin nanofibers with high crystallinity, high mechanical strength, wet capability, no toxicity and good skin and environment compatibility, seems to be an ideal candidate for wound dressing if used as non-woven tissue in the manufacture of nanocomposite based on collagen and peptides, as well as the incorporation of lignin and silver nanoparticles [13, 27]. Chitin nanofibrils-peptide composites appear to have reparative properties such as promoting the healing of wound skin tissue, reducing scar formation, and displaying a better water uptake capability than pure chitin nanofibrils, subsequently they facilitate the breathing requirement of injured skin with the growth of primary human fibroblast cells (data not reported). These bio-composite non-woven tissues have shown to modulate the secretion of defensins andMMPs during in vitro experiments [7, 13, 19, 24], while during in vivo studies, they displayed the shortest wound healing time when used to repair burned skin [26, 27]."

      "text" : "It is necessary to break down the data the composite industry reports in their different segments to gain a better understanding. According to the market research firm Lucintel [46], since 1960 the US composites industry has expanded 25-fold, while the steel industry has only experienced a 1.5-fold increase, and a 3-fold increase for the aluminum industries. On the other hand, the use of polymer nanocomposites for medical applications has gained significant globalmarketwith a predictedCompound Annual Growth Rate (CARG) of more than 24% until 2019. This is due to the introduction of innovative bio-based and eco-compatible polymers, contributing to the environment sustainability [47].\nAdditionally, the market is witnessing a growing demand for biodegradable and environment-friendly nanocomposites, because of the pollution created from the traditional plastic compounds. This is the reason behind the significant growth of nanotechnology and its utilization in regenerative medicine, and the use of nanocomposites produced from natural polymers that is able to mimic biological phenomena at its scale dimension. This could be the reason behind the rapid expansion of novel materials such as chitin and other nanostructured polysaccharides. As a result of their dimension, they can be engineered to imitate skin ECM, repair the neural tissue, mimic the crystal structure of human bone, or to be used as restorative resin for dental applications. Furthermore, the decoding of cellular and molecular mechanisms would enable us to reprogram or instruct cells, creating appropriate and effective nanomaterials and nanocomposites capable of preventing and treating different diseases.\nThese tissue-systems, therefore, can be engineered to alter their propertiesfunctions in response to specific internal or external stimuli. The goal is to create and produce nanomaterials and nanocomposites characterized by high effectiveness and low toxicity, free of side effects and eco-compatible.\nAs a result, these innovative biomedical scaffolds must be designed by scientists and technicians who have a deeper understanding into the natural physicochemical activities of biomaterialswith a fully integrated knowledge of how the building blocks of human cells, in both healthy and diseases states, function at the molecular level [48]. Thus, it will be possible to establish a bridge between the properties/functions of these scaffolds and the nutritional environmental necessities of the pathological/inflamed tissues, necessary to obtain successful products. This is the goal of our group and the EU PolyBioSkin research project dedicated to the study and identification of innovative nanomaterials, nanocomposites and non-woven tissues for regenerative medicine, made by natural waste ingredients, such as chitin nanofibrils and biolignin. Using these non-woven tissues as innovative carriers, entrapping different and selected active ingredients, it will be possible not only to make medical products to repair diseased skins, but also to produce innovative and effective cosmetics able to regenerate both aged and photo-aged skin.\nIn conclusion, driving the integration betweenmaterial chemistry and cell biology, it will be possible to satisfy the continuous request of products useful to maintain the\nhuman wellbeing, contemporary saving the environment biodiversity of our Planet and the natural raw materials for the incoming generations.\nAcknowledgements We thank the EU for the economic support given by the projects n-Chitopack, grant no. 315233, Biomimetic, grant no. 282945 and PolyBioSkin grant no. 745839.

In fact, with the increase in age, the prevention of skin diseases became a necessity for our society together with an amelioration of the general body appearance. Thus, while medications have been revolutionized in their structure by the use of biodegradable and nature-oriented non-woven tissues, the use of natural polysaccharides polymers in cosmetics such as beauty masks are becoming increasingly manufactured and sold to the public. This chapter reports the biological properties and applications of biopolymers as well as discussing the physicochemical characteristics and the skin repairing activity of non-woven tissues based on the use of chitin nanofibrils obtained from biomass.",
