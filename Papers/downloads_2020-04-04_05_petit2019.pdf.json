      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nIn the past twenty years, several studies in cellular biology have reveals the role of the mechanical environment in cell development and rheological properties [1]. Three key examples illustrate this aspect : (1) The value of the stiffness of the adhesive substrate impacts the stem cell differentiation [2] ; (2) The cells generate forces to shape the tissues during morphogenesis. The cell-cell interaction involves mechanically regulated clusters allowing the tensile forces to be coupled and transmitted during gastrulation and tissue polarization [3] ; (3) Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) nanoindentation on living healthy and tumorigenic cells revealed the effect of their different cytoskeletal conformations on cell stiffness [4]. This leads to a possible additional way to distinguish between cancer and healthy tissues. Based on these major discoveries highlighting that genetics cannot explain the whole development of cell, a new research field based on the concept of mechano-chemical transduction is growing to tackle these cell-environment interactions and their role in biological cells and tissues development [5]. In this context, it appears crucial to developed new concepts\n1.

Marchi is with UFR PhITEM, Univ Grenoble Alpes, UGA, Institut Néel, CNRS/UGA UPR 2940, Grenoble France, France florence.marchi@neel.cnrs.fr\nof teaching and training in order to illustrate the impact of the environment on rheological properties and cell morphology at micro and nanoscales. This new concept should be adaptable to the scientific and technical background and level of various students and pupils as well as the time dedicated to the practical and/or discovering activities. The main goals of these educational activities are threefold : (1) To perform the culture of mouse osteoblast cells and to seed them on a CYTOOTM chip where an adhesive fibronectin (FN) micropattern array is printed on a glass substrate surrounded by a cytophobic layer ; In this condition, the cells face a spatial environmental stress where they have to modulate their internal mechanical response in order to fit their morphology ; (2) To introduce how to use the main and complementary characterization techniques involved in this kind of micro/nano-rheology studies such as AFM and fluorescence microscopy (FM) and how to combine them to enhance the information display ; (3) To provide an intuitive mainstream access to the biomechanics of a cell. To reach this last goal, we have developed a virtual and interactive nano scene based on AFM experimental data recorded with one of the most popular AFM mode in micro/nano-rheology field called « Peakforce » (PF). This nanoscene displays visual and haptics renderings leading to an interactive offline exploration of the stiffness variation along a spread mouse osteoblast. Indeed, previous studies have successfully demonstrated that virtual reality combining visual rendering and haptic feedback is very powerful and well adapted to provide a quick and deep understanding of phenomena that remain out of human perception, as molecular bonding [6] ; [7], surgery [8], cell biology [9], [10] or micro/nano-scale forces taking place between a AFM tip and a sample [11]. The AFM probe is able to measure local force interactions with a sub-nanoNewton resolution at nanoscale using the so-called force spectroscopy mode [12]. When this force measurement is performed with a scanning movement and an automatic feedback loop, the AFM probe acts as a nanorobot and leads at the same time to 3D maps of morphology and force maps ; this topography and force combination was firstly called « Force-volume » (FV) mode. In the past this mode was in some cases performed on single fixed or living cell to map its response to a mechanical stress [13], [14]. However this process was time-consuming (a whole combined maps with a high resolution require several hours), it was not a routine mode. Recently a much faster version of this mode called « Peakforce » (PF) was implemented by Bruker company in their last version of AFM instruments\n978-1-7281-0948-0/19/$31.00 ©2019 IEEE\n[15], stimulating new trends in cell biology [16] ; [17]. Today Peakforce mode becomes the standard AFM mode in this research field. The development, the first of our knowledge, where a virtual nanoscene based experimental morphology and force maps recorded on a single cell in PF mode is coupled with a Haptic device, is described in the last part of this paper (section IV). This virtual and interactive station offers the opportunity to explore the morphology and local stiffness variation of the main cellular components on a fixed through our human sensory capabilities, as if we were able to see them through our eyes and to touch them with a nanofinger to feel their elasticity. The section II is dedicated to cell sample preparation and to the spatial identification of its main components by combining fluorescent and AFM microscopies. The section III covers the morphological and mechanical characterizations of soft samples by AFM Peakforce mode."

      "text" : "A mouse osteoblast cell line developed internally at the Institute for Advanced Biosciences (IAB) from Grenoble was used for this study. Cells were cultured in plastic dish formerly according to a standard protocol using complete medium containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with high glucose (4.5g/L), 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and Penicillin-Streptomycin antibiotic mix (PS). Cells were seeded at the density of 6.104 cells per CYTOOTM Starter chips according to the manufacturer’s instruction. After 2 hours incubation, cells were well spread and cell samples components were fluorescently stained for FM characterization (Fig. 1). The standard protocol for fluorescent staining consists in three steps : paraformaldehyde (4%) fixation, plasma membrane mild permeabilization with Triton X100, and staining with regular immunofluorescence (ABs) procedure.\nOnce stained, the cell samples remained hydrated in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) supplemented with PS for further characterization in FM and AFM. For FM we used a Carl Zeiss LSM 800 microscope for the identification of the different cell components constituting the cell architecture. Since the cell architecture may present various stiffness values on its whole surface during indentation, it is relevant to locate and identify the main cell components, namely : the cytoskeleton (CSK), made of filamentous act in (F-Actin) (Fig. 1C), the Focal Adhesions (FA) (Fig. 1D) linking the cell’s CSK to the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM), and the nucleus (Fig. 1E), the largest organelle which contains the genetic information in the DNA. The advantage of the CYTOO chips is to provide a fluorescent grid with several markers which are coded (Fig. 1A), so that the same single cell can be spotted for successive FM and AFM characterizations in PBS [14]. This combination of characterization techniques is fundamental for a better understanding of the organization and localization of the main cell components down to the nanoscale."

      "text" : "he AFM technique is a morphology and nanomechanical sensing method which was rewarded with a Nobel Prize in 1986 [18] ; [19]. The technique consists of a topographic\nanalysis over a small specified area by raster-scanning the surface with a very sharp tip at the end of a flexible cantilever (Fig. 2). This method is suitable for any type of material, because it relies only on the interatomic interaction, long-range forces (electromagnetic, electrostatic) and shortrange ones (chemical, capillarity, Van der Walls) [19]. The combination of all these effects leads to a distance-dependent potential between the atoms of the AFM tip and those of the sample surface. Hence, this interaction induces a deflection on the cantilever during the scan (Fig. 2E). The mechanical behavior of the cantilever is associated to its spring constant k (N/m), which can be well estimated thanks to the wellestablished Brownian motion method [20]. In practice, the value of the spring constant should be carefully selected according to the intensity of tip-sample force needed to scan the sample without damage (i.e. low k for soft and fragile sample as biological cell). The AFM is a powerful tool to map the topography (Fig. 2F) but also to various mechanical, electrical and even magnetic quantities [19] at nanoscale. Several different AFM working modes provide a topographic characterization, including the so-called contact and tapping modes [21]. The contact mode maintains a constant interaction by keeping the cantilever deflection equal to the setpoint (i.e., the reference deflection set in the scan parameters). On the contrary, the tapping mode results in an intermittent interaction between the tip and sample ;\nthat is the reason why it is applied preferably for sensitive samples like biological ones. Nevertheless, none of them offered a direct and rapid access to the mechanical properties of the sample such as the surface stiffness."

      "heading" : "B. Nanoindentation by AFM",
      "text" : "The AFM probe can act as a nanoindentor to sense the sample local mechanical properties [22]. In the static mode, the tip successively approaches the surface and retracts over a single point (Fig. 3A), while the photosensitive device computes the cantilever deflection δ(V) according to the scanner vertical displacement Zs(nm). The result is an approachretract force curve (Fig. 3B). A prior calibration defines the detection sensitivity s(nm/V) of the photodetector. As a result, the curve can be plotted as force measurement F (nN) versus the indentation depth h (equations in Fig. 3C and Fig. 3D) [23]. This force curve (Fig. 3B) displays various mechanical measurements such as adhesion force Fad and maximal indentation depth hind. Then, from the slope of the curve F versus h (Fig. 3B) the contact stiffness kccan be deduced and the local Young Modulus E can be estimated by applying a proper mechanical model of contact [24]. The Force Volume (FV) mode repeats the same operation (Fig. 3) on successive points over a specified area of interest and yields all the associated force curves. Moreover, the intermittent contact avoids high frictional forces of the standard contact mode and so sample damaging. Although this mode was widely used at the beginning of the investigation of the cell mechanics, its quasi-static functioning based on slow triangular signals (less than 10Hz) is time consuming, taking several hours for a full scan or is limited to poor resolutions such as (32*32) or (64*64) pixels [25]. In this context, the PeakForce mode with\nits signal acquisition efficiency has been gaining a particular interest in the applications combining AFM and biology, such as topography and rheology of living single-cells."

      "heading" : "C. PeackForce mode",
      "text" : "The PeakForce (PF) mode derives from the FV mode, it records successive force curves thanks to a dynamic sinusoidal signal applied on the piezoelectric actuator to drive quickly the cantilever up and down to the sample (Fig. 4). The cantilever is driven at frequency fPF that can be tuned between 0.25 up to 2 kHz ; fPF should be significantly lower than its resonance frequency f0 (Fig. 4B) to drag the cantilever in a steady position. To fit this condition as well as a low cantilever spring constant (to avoid damage of cell sample), we selected a Scanasystliquid AFM probe with measured parameters in air and at room temperature of respectively 84.4 kHz and 0.65 N/m for f0 and k. The acquisition time in PF mode is about few minutes for high resolution (128*128 or 256*256 pixels) and combined 3D topography and force maps. Moreover, this non-resonant mode implies that the tip follows the movement of the scanner avoiding the dynamics of aresonating system (Fig. 4B). The PF mode therefore combines the advantage of contact mode, namely direct force control, and tapping mode, i.e. intermittent contact avoiding damages due to permanent friction. For direct force control, the PF mode relies on the adjustment of the setpoint that corresponds to the maximal force applied on the sample while acquiring the spectroscopy curves (Fig. 4D). Hence, the height of the scanner is automatically adapted according to the local sample structure in order to keep the setpoint over the entire area of interest. In this way, the PF mode provides both topography and mechanical mapping. The setpoint parameter has to be carefully chosen as the best compromise between good-matching force acquisition and force-time curves (Fig. 3B and Fig. 4D) and without damaging the cell surface due to too high interaction forces. In practice, to map the cell in\nliquid, we fixed the PF setpoint and frequency respectively to around ten of nN and 0.25kHz. In fact, since the resonance frequency of the cantilever f0 is shifted to a lower value in liquid than in air due to the drag effect [3], drive frequency has to decrease to avoid any cantilever oscillation. In spite of this precaution, some damped oscillations may appear when the tip suddenly snap out of the contact (Fig. 4C2) due to the kinetic energy and the non-zero quality factor of the cantilever. For the present study, we used the PF mode on an ICON AFM with Nanoscope Analysis software (version 8.15) in liquid (PBS solution). We also activated the PeakForce Capture option to get the raw force curves for each pixel of the image. Then, we applied a custom processing for the extraction of the contact stiffness kC from the slope of the unload curve by combining the force curve data, notably the peak force and the indentation depth (Fig. 3B). The results were exported towards the haptic interface in two separate matrices of (256*256) elements containing the h indentation depth profile and the kC stiffness of a cell."

To this aim, we had to develop a contact model that takes into account the main mechanical characteristics of the cell and then implement the application in a 3D engine."

      "text" : "The contact model is based on the assumption that the explored surface behaves as a viscoelastic material, which relevant to describe a spread cell [26] ; [27]. According to the Kelvin-Voigt model, this kind of material can be represented by a purely elastic spring (stiffness) connected in parallel with a purely viscous damper (viscosity). Note that the surface is explored not only in depth (z axis), but also laterally (x, y axes), we thus have to develop a 3- dimensional viscoelastic contact model. The 3-dimensional\ncontact model is shown in Fig. 5, where Fx, Fy, and Fz are the force components applied to the surface. In return, where is contact, the material reacts according to the mechanical characteristics (elasticity and viscosity). This reaction is traduced by the haptic device thanks to a 3-dimensional returning force according to the sample local stiffness values and a chosen damping coefficient. Consequently, the operator gets a sensory feeling of the explored material. In our notations, ∆x, ∆y and ∆z, represents the displacement into the material, we have :\n∆x = x− xc ; ∆y = y − yc ; ∆z = z − hxy (1)\nwhere (x, y, z) represents the position of the moving part of the haptic device, (xc, yc) are the coordinates of the contact point, and hxy is the reconstructed surface profile at the contact point. In our application, the mechanical characteristics are not homogeneous in space, i.e. the stiffness coefficients kx, ky , kz , and the viscous coefficients bx, by , bz , depend on the contact position (xc, yc). However, for small displacements, it can be assumed that these coefficients are equals and constants in the vicinity of the contact position, giving thus :\nkx(xc, yc) = ky(xc, yc) = kz(xc, yc) = kc(xc, yc) (2)\nbx(xc, yc) = by(xc, yc) = bz(xc, yc) = b(xc, yc) (3)\nUnder this assumption, the algorithm will only require the sample stiffness and viscous coefficients matrices kC and b as well as the sample profile hxy at the contact point (xc, yc). These aspects have been discussed in Section 3 except for the b values which will be given a constant default value to ensure the haptic feedback stability."

      "text" : "The AFM topography and stiffness maps were initially exported from the Nanoscope Analysis software towards MATLAB where were Gaussian-filtered and plotted. The two (256*256) elements matrices of two different samples are displayed in Fig. 7 : on the top, a mixture of two polymers where Low Density Polyethylene (LPDE) microspheres are embedded in a matrix of polystyrene (PS), on the bottom the fixed osteoblast cell on Fn micropattern with a I shape. The PS/LDPE is a reference sample with well-known mechanical properties (ratio of 10 between the two Young Modulus). We used it as a test sample to validate the PF mode implementation in the interactive virtual nanoscene coupled with the Novint haptic device (Fig. 8). Notice that the scanned image of the cell (Fig. 7c) is (45*45) µm, the nucleus maximum height is 2.0 µm and the thickness of the lateral focal adhesions is between 0.02 and 0.2 µm. As for the stiffness, we may notice values in the central region between 0.06 and 0.12 N/m, showing that the nucleus is the softest region. The focal adhesions and the stress fibers of the cytoskeleton, are between 0.12 to 0.25 N/m and the substrate is around 0.4 N/m. We may also notice that the focal adhesions in the right corner are almost invisible on the topography map in the Fig. 7c (hidden by the nucleus), while they are quite noticeable in the stiffness map (Fig. 7d). This underlines the interest of combination of sensorial renderings to display two different sample information : thanks to the haptic exploration we could “sense” the cell mechanics beyond the visible perception of its morphology. Next step was to transform the hxy matrix in a 3D object such as a « .stl » file type, which was straightforward to convert in MATLAB by using a function called « surf2stl ». The kC matrix is\nsaved in a « .csv » file. Once the « .stl » file of the scanned cell is generated, it will be converted into an « .obj » file using an online 3D files converter such as meshconvert.com. The converted object file is then imported into the Unity engine whose interface looks like in Fig. 8. The converted model is initially unscaled. For the cell a modification of scale and orientation is performed using a fixed gain of 0.22 cm/µm to adapt the cell 3D object which is 45µm to the size of the 10 cm workspace of the haptic device.For the PS/LPDE sample the XY gains are 1cm/µm while the vertical profile was increased to 15 cm/µm for a better view. A set of C♯ scripts were developed in Unity to integrate the Novint haptic interaction in Virtual Reality. The first one is the communication script that gets the (x, y, z) positions of the haptic device and restores it to the tip on the 3D virtual environment. The second script allows the physical interaction between the 3D objects using mesh colliders. The principle is to detect collision between the tip and the surface (xc, yc) and generate forces (Fx, Fy, Fz) on the haptic device to react to the movement by up to 4N of net force. For this purpose, a separate script extracts the local stiffness value from the stiffness matrix kC which was saved into a « .csv » file by using a parser. The AFM tip is controlled by the haptic device and it appears as a cone in the virtual environment (Fig. 8a). When this tip apex enters on collision with the surface its color turns red upon indenting the cell. This color change is useful to highlight the experimenter that the indentation process starts. For a better 3D immersion in the VR environment we used two slightly-shifted virtual cameras in a stereoscopic configuration and connected to an Oculus Rift headset (Fig. 8c), whose configuration is straightforward using the provided Unity plug-in."

The tactilomechanical perception of a micrometric cell derived from the living is often a revelation for the students. Biologists realize that the structure of the cellular skeleton composed of polymers in self-equilibrium, is closely related to the cellular mechanical properties of internal tension, stiffness, and adhesion. Physicists discover how the forms of life are « diagrams of the underlying forces » and that the living at the scale of the cell and the molecule can be described and experience by the action of a force on a mass."

We combined the advantages of the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Fluorescence Microscopy (FM) in order to get complementary real experimental data on an isolated animal adhering on a protein micro-pattern. We obtained high resolution mapping images of the cell morphology, architecture, and local mechanical properties. Then this set of data was implemented in a free simulation engine connected to a low-cost haptic device to create a virtual and interactive cell or polymer environment in order to provide a novel sensory approach of the cell biology and/or micro(bio)mechanics.",
