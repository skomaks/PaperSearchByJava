      "text" : "Wastewater treatment has been one of the biggest challenges to overcome worldwide, being pharmaceutical effluents some of the main residues associated with water pollution. The implementation of nanotechnology to remove pharmaceutical pollutants from respective wastewater effluents, such as antibiotics, pesticides, hormones, antiviral drugs, toxic dyes, among others, has been increasing during the last decades. The sorbent materials produced at nanoscale offer unique properties, such as high absorption, large surface area, eco-friendly fabrication, and huge affinity to organic and inorganic compounds. This article aims to provide an overview for researchers about some of the current nanotechnology applications for the treatment of pharmaceutical-based wastewater effluents. Sustainable exploitation of novel nano-sorbent materials could be useful for environmental purposes focused on the removal of pollutants in water. Keywords: Wastewater; Emerging contaminants; Nanomaterials; Environmental impact\nIntroduction - problem statement and opportunities Nowadays, the world is facing a huge environmental problem related to water contamination due to a wide variety of industrial, agricultural, and domestic waste. The above-mentioned waste sources have severely polluted groundwater and surface water via the sewer system, reducing their quality as a supplier of freshwater for human use [1]. Highlighting that, for instance, antibiotics (tetracycline), anti-inflammatories (Ibuprofen), antidepressants (Carbamazepine),\nhormones (Estradiol), anticonvulsants (Phenytoin), beta-blockers (Propranolol), lipid regulators (Fenofibric acid), and X-ray contrast, are among the most commonly detected pharmaceutical-based pollutants [2]. These toxic contaminants modify the physical and chemical properties of water, representing a high risk for human health and entire living ecosystems [3]. This is also because most of them are considered persistent or emerging environmental contaminants, which are difficult to degrade, completely [4]. Besides, pharmaceutical wastes in water are related to endocrine disruption, chronic diseases, allergies, tumors, antibiotic resistance, microflora imbalance, metabolic perturbations, among other health problems [2], [5]. Meanwhile, aquatic life is affected by disrupting many physiological functions, damaging fish spawning, reducing fertility, bioaccumulation of pollutants in body tissue, and eutrophication [2], [6]. The identification, quantification, control, and elimination of contaminants represents a fundamental issue to prevent or minimize adverse effects in human health and environmental damage [7]. However, the adequate treatment of wastewater needs improvements in its methods to counter the increasing use of harmful biological or chemical substances in pharmaceutical activities, which sometimes are difficult to identify, to treat, or to eliminate [5]. These substances are usually found in deficient concentrations (μg/L or ng/L), so they tend to escape from treatments and begin to accumulate on the environment due to their low volatile properties [8]. As well, toxic secondary products result from some conventional water treatment methodologies such as chlorination or ozonation [9]. Otherwise, the population also contributes to pollute with pharmaceutical compounds by releasing them into the environment by flushing unused drugs, inappropriate disposal of drugs, or even human and animal excretions [5]. So, there is an urgent need to remove all these potentially toxic and hazardous contaminants from aquatic ecosystems to avoid ecological damage and adverse effects on human health [4], [8]. Therefore, the water treatment industry is working on the development of sustainable solutions through the research of more effective purification materials, which should be able to remove several pollutants during the same procedure to achieve the standard\nlimits established on the regulations [10]. Mainly, because conventional methodologies, such as mechanical, biological, chemical, and physical treatments, or even a combination of these sometimes are incapable of degrading or eliminating complex compounds or metabolites [5]. Thus, attention is focused on developing sustainable, powerful, and cost-effective methodologies to produce freshwater for human use [11]. A recent alternative to mitigate pharmaceutical pollution of water is nanotechnology, which is focused on the development of new devices, materials and structures that have at least one nanoscale dimension ranging from 1 to 100 nm [1], [12], [13]. Additionally, nanomaterials provide unique physicochemical characteristics, including nano size, large surface area, strong solution mobility, high reactivity, a great number of active sites, catalytic potential, porosity, strong adsorption, dispersibility, enhanced redox and photocatalytic properties [1], [3], [6]. Thus, nanotechnology represents a modern tool for treating contaminated water with metallic ions, organic and inorganic solutes, and microorganisms, by designing particles and filters that interacts with the pollutants through binding or causing inactivation and degradation [7]. Otherwise, the use of nano-based water treatment applications is classified into three main groups: water filtration, water remediation, and water purification [1]. Water filtration is based on the use of semi-permeable nanoporous membranes (0.001 to 0.01 μm) with high stability, easy and cheap operation and low energy consumption, for removing unwanted organic compounds and micro-pollutants [5], [11], [14]. Water remediation is focused on the phenomena of adsorption to eliminate a broad variety of chemical pollutants [5] through nanosorbents that are nanostructures with high affinity for specific organic or inorganic materials, such as zeolites, carbon-based, bio-based and metal oxide-based materials [3], which represents a simple, effective, easy to operate and widely used method for removing water pollutants [8]. Finally, water purification or disinfection is targeted on the effective control of pathogens without the formation of toxic disinfection residues [10] by the use of nanomaterials with antibacterial activity as graphenebased materials, metallic and bioactive composites [1], [14].\nRole of nanomaterials in wastewater treatment"

      "text" : "Adsorption represents one of the most important water treatment methodologies for removing organic and inorganic water pollutants, due to its easy operation and design, usually low cost and the wide range of contaminants that can remove [5]. During the adsorption process, the solutes present in the gas or the liquid sample are attached and accumulated in the absorbent, which is commonly a solid surface [12]. Otherwise, nanosorbents are nanoscale structures characterized by a large reactive surface area, high porosity, catalytic potential, and high affinity [3]. Carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs) are composed entirely or mainly by carbon atoms [15], and they are characterized by their useful properties for water treatment and desalination, including mechanical strength, electron affinity, and flexibility during functionalization [11]. Even, CBNs can be integrated into membranes or other structural media for enhancing its properties to remove aqueous pollutants [12]. The most common CBNs include carbon nanotubes (single-walled and multi-walled), carbon nanofibers, graphene, fullerene, carbonbased composites, and derivatives [15]. Highlighting that the most used kind of absorbent for water treatment are granular activated carbon and powdered activated carbon as a result of their broad-spectrum removal capability, low cost, high absorption properties, and easy disposal. However, they present slow adsorption kinetics and difficulty for regeneration [5]. For overcoming those disadvantages, carbon nanotubes were developed as a new generation of carbonaceous adsorbents, and even, they demonstrated higher adsorption capability and efficiency [9]. Carbon nanotubes-based sorbent materials The need to improve water quality has encouraged the research of new materials for reducing and eliminating pollutants through wastewater treatment. Carbonbased materials have demonstrated their superior adsorbent properties to remove organic and inorganic contaminants from water. Among carbon-based materials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have emerged as a possible alternative [3]. CNTs represent a carbon allotrope in which a hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms in SP2\nhybridization (graphitic sheets) are rolled in a cylinder-shaped structure [1], [9]. CNTs are classified in two main categories depending on the number of graphene sheets rolled to form the tube: single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) that consist on a single layer of carbon atoms, and multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) that consist up to dozens of carbon layers [5], [11]. Moreover, SWCNTs exhibit a diameter between 0 to 3 nm; while, MWCNTs can reach up to 100 nm of diameter [12]. CTNs exhibit particular morphological and physicochemical characteristics that offer significant advantages over other adsorbents, as high and rapid absorption capabilities, thermal and oxidation stability, electrical conductivity, high electron storage capacity, and flexibility [3], [9]. In the same way, CTNs present some disadvantages such as a highly hydrophobic surface, low dispersion in aqueous solutions and poor interfacial interaction, which produces agglomeration, reducing their adsorption efficiency [9], [11], as well as, potential toxicity to aquatic organisms in concentrations of mg/L, depending on the organism [16]. Moreover, since their discovery, CNTs have been extensively used as effective adsorbents, but its application is limited due to its high synthesis and purification cost, compared with absorbents such as activated carbon [3]. CTNs performance can be optimized through functionalizing the surface of the nanotubes with different functional groups to improve their environmental applications. Functionalization with carboxylic, lactonic, or phenolic groups stimulates polar compounds adsorption through chemical interactions. Instead, an unfunctionalized surface tends to adsorb non-polar compounds by physical forces [3], [9], [12]. One example of the advantages of functionalization was achieved by Wang et al. by comparing the removal of acetaminophen between non functionalized MWCNTs and hydroxylated MWCNTs, where after 120 minutes of filtration 29% and 74% of the pollutant was removed, respectively [17]. Graphene-based sorbent materials As well as CNTs, graphene represents an emerging carbon-based nanosorbent for removing water contaminants [6], which consists of a particular two-dimensional single layer of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice [12], [18]. Since the last decade, graphene has drawn the attention of the scientific\ncommunity because of its superior properties compared with other nanosorbents. Even, graphene oxide offers some comparative advantages over CNTs, such as lower production costs, higher adsorbent surface (single graphene layer allows it to interact with pollutants through its two basal planes; while, inner walls of CNTs are not accessible by adsorbates), easier synthesis method by graphite exfoliation, free of catalysis residues synthesis, and a larger number of oxygen-containing functional groups that increase its absorbent potential [3], [13]. Nevertheless, graphene oxide presents some restrictions due to the characteristics of the treated solution, affects graphene adsorption capacity, including pH, ionic strength, temperature, and natural organic matter or surfactant concentrations [13]. Furthermore, graphene-based materials have been studied for enhancing separation membranes properties, such as ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, forward osmosis, ion exchange, among other membranes [19]. However, nanofiltration has aroused a lot of attention based on its unique properties with a separation capability among 200 – 1000 g/mol [20], in which 2D graphene oxide sheets are organized in a composite membrane to establish laminar nanochannels (around 0.9 nm) that allows an effective water path and blocks larger molecules [21]. In addition, graphene oxide membranes present an energy-efficient and simple operational process as advantages over other membranes, so they are widely used for wastewater treatment despite their mechanical strength, selectivity, thermochemical stability, and permeability should be increased [22].\nBiogenic nanoparticles-based sorbent materials\nSynthesis of metallic nanoparticles includes physical, chemical, and biological methods. Physical methods include evaporation-condensation, laser ablation, electrolysis, pyrolysis, diffusion plasma arcing, sputter deposition, and high energy balling; chemical methods involve techniques such as chemical reduction, microemulsion, electrochemical, thermal decomposition, sol-gel process and coprecipitation [23]. Several nanosorbent materials based metallic nanoparticles have been developed by using physical and chemical methods to remove dyes and antibiotics, for instance, Rhodamine [24], amoxicillin [25], and doxorubicin [26]. Therefore, biological methods comprise the exploitation of biological mass either\nplant or microbial mediated as reductant agent via extracellularly or intracellularly [27]. As efficient nanosorbents, biogenic nanoparticles have been developed among research groups worldwide for wastewater treatment from pharmaceutical industries. The formation of this kind of nanoparticles is given by the presence of bioactive molecules such as peptides, enzymes, vitamins, alkaloids, phenolics, among others obtained from different bio sources (e.g., plant extracts, bacteria, fungi, etc.) that are combined with a metal salt solution under different conditions depending on nature of the precursor materials and the final intended used of NPs [28]. Microbial green technology has been successfully used to synthesized zirconia nanoparticles for adsorption driven bioremediation of tetracycline from wastewater by Debnath et al., [29]. It was found that the use of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a bioactive source in the synthesis process allowed the formation of secondary metabolites during the bacterial growth, which contributed to capping and stabilizing agents for the ZrO2NPs formation. According to the authors, the NPs showed a high adsorption capacity for tetracycline (526.32 mg/g) in 15 min at neutral pH 6.0, which makes them economical and suitable for practical applications. The potential application of this type of nanoparticles has also played an important role in caffeine degradation that is considered the most representative ingredient used for drug preparation proposes and pharmaceutically active compound pollutant based [30]. According to a recent study performed by Muthukumar and coworkers [31], the use of silver ferrite nanoparticles fabricated with Amaranthus blitum leaf extract may act as a photocatalytic degrader of caffeine in synthetic coffee wastewater. The authors reported a maximum degradation of 99.9% at pH 9.0 in 15 h and 95% degradation in 24h under optimized conditions suggesting the NPs formulation as a potential catalyst for treating caffeine wastewater. Furthermore, a new biosorbent system based Keratine nanoparticles obtained from human hair has been applied for cationic dye removal of crystal violet from aqueous solution by Abbasi and coworkers [32] as a suitable procedure to reuse wasted hairs. The stability studies showed the enormous potential of NPs to be\nused as a safe, economical and effective biosorbent for removal of different cationic dyes, the contribution percentage of the factor for removal crystal violet was 75.97% at pH 7 and contact time up to 5h. Nanofiltration membranes Nanofiltration (NF) is a process in which excellent quality water can be obtained employing pressure. NF membranes are highly accepted due to their low cost, good uptake of pollutants, low energy consumption, and biocompatibility [13], [33]. This type of membrane is used to capture groundwater, drinking water, wastewater treatment, and surface water [34]. Its main applications are for the purification of refined oil, chemical production, and carbon capture. It has been detected that more than 200 pharmaceutical active compounds are found in groundwater [35], being an environmental hazard, some of the effects that can produce are disorders in animal reproduction, bacterial resistance to antibiotics, bioaccumulation of drugs, and high persistence of some drugs after treatment by drinking water treatment plants. NF membranes can retain pharmaceutical industry compounds by being hydrophilic and biologically persistent. In turn, due to the electrostatic effect, it helps to have a better rejection of the pharmaceutical compounds, having an improvement in the adsorption of the membrane [36]. The NF membranes fall into three categories; inorganic membranes, organic polymeric membranes, and organic-inorganic membranes, each having a representative factor in the percentage of drug removal in the water. Most NF membranes have a thin-film, which is a multi-layer composite, the support layers, which provide support and allow flow and the active layer, which can perform separation with high selectivity [33]. The removal of contaminants is related to the pore size and the electric charge of the NF membrane [34]. Some studies indicate that the deposition of nanoparticles on the surface of the membrane increases the rejection of the solutes and reduces the membrane fouling. Although, the deposition of these nanoparticles reduces the density of the pores, increasing the energy consumption during filtering [37]. Some studies mention that incorporating nanoparticles to the surface of the NF membrane improves the percentage of removal of pharmaceutical actives [25],\n[37]–[39]. Additionally, NF membranes aid the removal of highly water-soluble drugs and compounds, like sulfamethazine and triclosan having removal percentages higher than 90% when percentages are normally less than 40% [40]. It should be noted that existing nanofiltration membranes that incorporate carbon structures, such as graphene [41], or can be composed entirely of graphene oxide such as thin-film graphene membranes [42]. The innovation of this type of membranes is that they present simple accessibility, high mechanical strength, chemical stability, higher surface area, facility of separation from water, recyclability, and superhydrophobicity [43]. Due to surface lipophilic, it tends to attract hydrophobic contaminants, essentially used in the pharmaceutical industry, having percentages of removal of these from 65% to 99% [41]–[43]. Conclusion and recommendations Nanotechnology has taken a transcendent interest for wastewater treatment, due to its small size, large surface area, large porosity, and high chemical reaction of the nanomaterials; They have better properties, whether catalytic, adsorption or filtering. Removing different organic and inorganic compounds of the water used in the pharmaceutical industry. The different types of nanomaterials, used for this purpose, have their advantages and disadvantages such as; Carbon-based nanomaterials, which are easy to manipulate, have a large surface area and volume, which allows a higher amount of compounds to be adsorbed, up to 99%, [21], but these have a high price, unusual specificity and extraordinary toxicity to the environment. Whereas, biogenic materials are eco-friendly and in some circumstances such nanomaterials can be recovered from waste, obtaining an efficient degradation of drugs (99%) [29], the disadvantage of these materials is the necessity of controlled environments to evaluate their performance, additionally, more in-depth research endeavors are needed to optimize fabrication protocols in terms of yield and cost, culturing and management of the bio sources implemented during the synthesis processes; Nanofiltration membranes, this type of nanomaterials have an excellent price, consume scarce energy, the synthesis is scaled industrially and have an excellent removal of pharmaceutical industry compounds, more than 90% [47]. The disadvantages are that these membranes\nhave a specific life-time and have not been evaluated their toxicity to the environment. Even though there is a significant advance in the investigation of nanomaterials and knowledge of their capability to remove compounds utterly, there is still the challenge of recycling these nanomaterials. Furthermore, in many cases, exists the problem of the stability of the nanoparticles, which tend to agglomerate with time. In general, the most critical issues to address are fate and toxicity studies of these nanomaterials in the environment and the implementation of strategies and protocols for proper disposal or recycling. For the above reasons, the synthesis of environmentally friendly nanomaterials with low toxicity is captivating attention in this area.
