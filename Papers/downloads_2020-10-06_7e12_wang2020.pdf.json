      "text" : "Cell-based injectable therapy utilizing stem cells is a promising approach for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Applying a magnetically controlled cell delivery approach has enormous potential to enhance cell retention capability within the specified site. To assess the therapeutic efficacy of cellular magnetic targeting, we applied an external magnetic force to target an adipose-derived stem cell based therapy in a rat model of SUI. The results revealed that magnetic attraction of transplanted cells under the magnetic field was generated by cell uptake of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in vitro. More importantly, magnetic targeting improved the retention rate of transplanted cells and facilitated the restoration of sphincter structure and function in a rat SUI model according to the results of histological examination and urodynamic testing. Therefore, magnetically guided targeting strategy might be a potential therapy method for treatment of SUI. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

All rights reserved.\nIntrinsic urethral sphincter deficiency (ISD) is a significant cause of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women.1–3 A total of 37.7% of women older than 60 years have urinary incontinence.4 Traditionally, a suburethral sling approach has been used to correct poor anatomic support of the urethra, but this treatment modality has demonstrated a low success rate as it does not restore damaged sphincter function.5,6 Periurethral injection of a bulking agent, such as bovine collagen, has become a widely accepted treatment for ISD-associated SUI.7–9 However, this treatment has poor long-term efficacy because the agent is absorbed and is also associated with severe side effects such as foreign giant cell responses, periurethral abscess formation, erosion of the bladder or urethra, dysuria, and pulmonary embolism.10,11 Thus, alternative treatments, especially those that can regenerate the damaged urethral sphincter, may provide a better therapeutic strategy.12,13 In this regard, stem cell\nimplantation is a promising therapeutic strategy to regenerate damaged sphincter muscle.14 ,15\nClinical trials of stem cell transplantation treatments for SUI demonstrated short-term functional improvement of the urethral sphincter,16–19 which was partly attributable to poor cell retention. Although use of a high dose of cells can ensure a sufficient number of functional cells are retained at lesion sites, this approach is both costly and is associated with greater morbidity risks.20,21 To improve cell retention and enhance therapeutic efficacy, magnetic force was utilized to develop a new cell delivery system for injection-based therapies.22–26 By strategically applying a magnetic force, magnetically labeled cells can be attracted and accumulated at the target site with minimal loss during injection.27,28\nHerein, adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were differentiated into myoblasts by 5-azacytidine (5-Aza) stimulation and then labeled with super-paramagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles. In this manner, SPIO-labeled cells could be manipulated by application of a magnetic field by means of a permanent magnet. We first evaluated the viability and cytotoxicity of magnetically labeled cells, then examined the arrangement of magnetically labeled cells in the presence of magnetic fields in vitro. Finally, we explored the safety and efficacy of magnetically targeted cell delivery in a rat model of SUI."

Fetal bovine serum (FBS), Horse serum, and low-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (LG-DMEM) were purchased from Gibco Company (Gaithersburg, MD). 5-Aza was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). A toroidal permanent neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet (Shanghai Chan Electronic Technology, Shanghai, China) with 0.19 T, 8- mm outer diameter, and 4-mm inner diameter was used in this study.\nSynthesis and characteristics of SPIO nanoparticles\nThe protocol to synthesize SPIO was adopted from previously reported studies.29 Briefly, a solution consisting of ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol at a volumetric ratio of 3:17 was mixed at room temperature, followed by gradual addition of 1.35 g FeCl3·6H2O and 0.40 g Na3Cit under vigorous stirring for 0.5 h. Second, 2 g NaAc·3H2O and 8 g PVP was added into the mixture under nitrogen protection at room temperature with continuous stirring for 30 min and then transferred into a 50 mL microwave reaction kettle, which was used to perform the microwave-assisted solvothermal process at 200 °C for 2 h. After reacting, SPIO nanoparticles were separated by a magnetic separator, washed 3 times with deionized water, and then stored at 4 °C. Morphologies of synthesized SPIO nanoparticles were\nviewed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit Biotwin) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM; JEM2100F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at an operating voltage of 200 kV. Briefly, 20 μL droplets of the SPIO samples were dropped onto a copper grid, dried in the air, and then loaded into the microscope for imaging. The hydrodynamic size and zeta potential of the SPIO nanoparticles were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS, Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90, UK)."

The SUI model was constructed by vaginal balloon dilation (VBD) and excision of bilateral ovaries (EBO), as previously described.30 Meanwhile, adipose tissues from the inguinal fat pad were collected for harvesting ADSCs, which were isolated and expanded according to a previously reported method.31,32 Briefly, fresh adipose tissues were dispersed by digestion with 0.10% collagenase I (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h. The resulting suspension was filtered through 150-μm stainless steel mesh and then centrifuged to remove the supernatant. Isolated ADSCs were resuspended in LG-DMEM containing 10% FBS, and cultured in a 10-cm dish at 37 °C with 5% CO2. ADSCs were harvested at passage one for subsequent experiments.

For osteogenic differentiation, ADSCs were cultured in LG-DMEM with 10% FBS, 0.1 μM dexamethasone, 10 mM b-glycerol phosphate, and 50 μM ascorbic acid for 3 weeks, and analyzed by with Alizarin red. For adipogenic differentiation, ADSCs were cultured in LG-DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.5 mM 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, 10 μg/ml insulin, 1 μM dexamethasone, and 100 μM indomethacin for 2 weeks and detected by oil red staining. For myogenic differentiation, ADSCs were cultured in LG-DMEM with 5% FBS, 5% horse serum, and 10 μmol/L 5-azacytidine (5- Aza, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 3 weeks. Cells were assessed by immunohistochemical staining with rabbit monoclonal anti-α-SMA and anti-desmin (myoblast-specific markers) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).\nPreparation of magnetically and fluorescently labeled cells (Mag-PKH-ADSCs)\nUpon induction with 5-Aza, ADSCs differentiated into myoblasts. These induced ADSCs were incubated with SPIO and polyamine poly-L-lysine hydrobromide (0.75 μg/mL). Concentrations of magnetic SPIO used for labeling were 12.5 μg/mL, 25 μg/mL, and 50 μg/mL. Magnetic SPIO-labeled induced ADSCs (Mag-ADSCs) were then labeled with red\nfluorescent dye (PKH, Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Iron content in cells at different SPIO concentrations was quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS; MICI, Switzerland). The staining efficacy of the PKH dye was observed by fluorescence microscopy.\nCell viability was detected using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, different concentrations (12.5 μg/mL, 25 μg/mL, and 50 μg/mL) of magnetic SPIO- and PKH-labeled induced ADSCs (Mag-PKH-ADSCs) were added to 96-well plates (2 × 103 cells/well) for 24-h incubation. Unlabeled induced ADSCs served as a control group. CCK-8 (10 μL) was added to each well for 2 h. Optical density (OD) values were then measured at a wavelength of 450 nm.\nPrussian blue staining and TEM examination of labeled cells\nPrussian blue staining was used to localize intracellular iron particles within Mag-PKH-ADSCs. Labeled cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then rinsed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) three times. Next, labeled cells were treated with 10% potassium ferrocyanide for 30 min at 37 °C and washed in distilled water. Finally, cells were counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red for 10 min and visualized by optical microscopy. TEM was undertaken as previously described34 to further evaluate the ultrastructural localization of intracellular iron particles in Mag-PKH-ADSCs.\nMagnetic force distribution and cell migration in vitro\nMag-PKH-ADSCs were collected, re-suspended in the culture medium at a density of 6 × 104 cells/mL, and then placed in 34.8-mm culture dish. An NdFeB magnet ring was then placed beneath the bottom of the cell culture dish for 24 h with 5% CO2 at 37 °C, creating a magnetic field gradient. The distribution of Mag-PKH-ADSCs in the culture dish was observed by optical microscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out using a clinical 3.0 T MR scanner (PharmaScan, Bruker, Germany) applying a T2-weighted sequence. Measurement parameters were as follows: repetition time = 2300 ms; time to echo = 52 ms, matrix = 320 × 256, and slice thickness = 2 mm.\nMagnetic targeting of Mag-PKH-ADSCs in SUI rats\nForty female Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups1: sham group (n = 10), did not undergo VBD or EBO as other three groups [which had SUI confirmed by leak pressure point (LPP) measurement at 1 month]2; PBS group (n = 10), single injection of 200 μL PBS3; No Mag group (n = 10), single injection of 1.5 × 106 Mag-PKH-ADSCs without magnetic guidance; and4 Mag group (n = 10), single injection of 1.5 × 106 Mag-PKH-ADSCs with magnetic guidance. In the Mag group, 1.5 × 106 Mag-PKH-ADSCs resuspended in 200 μL of PBS were injected transurethrally through a 30-G needle into the urethral sphincter area at approximately the 4, 8, and 12 o'clock positions. For magnetic targeting, the toroidal NdFeB magnet was placed close to the injected position for 20 min."

The other end of the bladder catheter was connected to a pressure transducer (ADInstruments, Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia) to measure bladder pressure and a microinfusion pump to continuously fill the bladder with sterile PBS and methylene blue (6 mL/h).

The hydrodynamic size of the SPIO nanoparticles determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) was measured to be 60.8 nm (Figure 2, C). Due to the presence of the hydrated shell, the size of the SPIO nanoparticles measured by DLS was larger than that measured by TEM.

In subsequent experiments, an iron concentration of 25 μg/mL was used to label cells with an efficiency of over 90% (Figure S1). Mag-PKH-ADSCs labeled with SPIO and PKH showed a strong red fluorescence signal (Figure 3, C).\nPrussian blue staining revealed intracytoplasmic blue stained iron granules in labeled Mag-PKH-ADSCs (Figure 3, D). TEM imaging showed that magnetic SPIO distributed in the cytoplasm, and the ultramicrostructure did not appear to be damaged (Figure 3, E). Higher-magnification images further indicated the presence of magnetic SPIO particles predominantly in endosomes/lysosomes (Figure 3, E). In dividing cells, the distribution of SPIO was approximately equal (Figure 3, F and G).\nMagnetically guided distribution of Mag-PKH-ADSCs in vitro\nWhen a toroidal NdFeB magnet was placed under the culture dish, the distribution of Mag-PKH-ADSCs showed a red fluorescence ring signal (Figure 4, A). Labeled cells were rapidly\ndragged down and distributed along the magnetic lines of force at the very beginning of re-culture (Figure 4, B). After 1 d of incubation, a brown ring was observed on the bottom of the culture dish (Figure 4, C). Inverted microscopy revealed majority of Mag-PKH-ADSCs at the edge of the toroidal magnet, while a small minority of cells were distributed elsewhere, far from the edge of the magnet (Figure 4, D). MRI results demonstrated a hypointense signal ring on T2 images (Figure 4, E and F), which could be easily observed by the naked eye. In the absence of a\nmagnetic force, labeled cells were evenly distributed throughout the culture dish.\nMagnetic force influences Mag-PKH-ADSC retention and distribution\nTwo months after Mag-PKH-ADSC injection into the urethral sphincter area with or without magnetically guided targeting (Figure 5, A), T2-weighted MR images were performed to examine\nthe relative localization of injected cells. Labeled cells showed a relatively hypointense signal at initial injection sites in the Mag group (Figure 5, B), whereas this hypointense signal was not observed in either the NoMag or PBS groups. The hypointense signal intensity of the Mag group in the urethral sphincter area indicated that the attracting effect of the magnetic field enhanced cellular accumulation and retention at the target site. The relationship between the hypointense signal area in T2-weighted MRI images and the\ndistribution pattern of Mag-PKH-ADSCs was further confirmed by Prussian blue staining (Figure 5, C). Moreover, an increased number of labeled cellswere observed in theMaggroup comparedwith theNo Mag group (Figure 5, C). However, the distribution of labeled cells showed a relatively uneven dispersion pattern in the urethral sphincter area in both Mag and No Mag groups.\nHistological and IF staining revealed that the thickness of the urethral sphincter was diminished in the PBS group. However,\nthe thickness of urethral sphincters in the Mag group was increased compared with the PBS group or the No Mag group (Figure 5, D). Moreover, the proportion of PKH-labeled cells observed in the urethral sphincter area of the Mag group was significantly larger than those found in the No Mag group, consistent with Prussian blue staining results described above (Figure 5, D). Figure 6 showed that no evident lesions or other anomalies were identified in either No Mag or Mag groups. Considering that Prussian blue-positive staining represents iron presumably fromMag-PKH-ADSCs, decreased retention of cells was observed in normal tissue."

The LPP of rats was significantly increased in Mag group (36.59 ± 2.63 cmH2O) and No Mag group (33.74 ± 3.44 cmH2O) compared with the PBS group (P < 0.05) (Figure 7). The LPP in the Mag group was slightly higher than that in the No Mag groups, and it recovered to nearly the same level as the sham group at 2 months postoperation (P > 0.05) (Figure 7). The data strongly suggests that the attracting effect of an externally applied magnetic field could effectively enhance cellular retention at the injected site and improve sphincter function in a rat model of SUI. Taken together, these findings could have important clinically relevant implications to improve SUI disease outcomes."

      "heading" : "Discussion",
      "text" : "Cell-based injectable therapy for SUI has recently been attempted both experimentally and clinically.35–37 Cell based therapies utilizing stem cells may become a minimally invasive alternative to other treatments for reconstructing damaged or aged urethral sphincter. In this regard, several kinds of stem cells have been studied, including muscle-derived stem cells,38–40 bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell,41 ,42 amniotic fluid stem cells,43 ,44 and umbilical cord blood stem cells.17 ,45 When compared with the aforementioned cell sources, ADSCs\npossess several advantages for clinical application, including ease of access to sufficient adipose tissue, a less invasive harvesting procedure, and the capability for myogenic differentiation.46,47\nRetention of cells after periurethral injection is crucial to restoring sphincter function.48 However, traditional direct injection of cells into the damaged tissue has historically resulted in poor cell retention at the injection site. To address this challenge and improve cell retention, the application of an external magnetic field was performed in our study design. The application of a targeted magnetic field can attenuate cell loss by preventing the leakage of dispersed cells to surrounding tissues after injection by enhancing the localization of cells at the site of interest. In addition, magnetized cells (as a novel magnetic source) accumulate in densified multi-cellular clusters. These three-dimensional multicellular clusters improve cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions, thereby providing a more optimal environment to enhance cell survival.\nDistribution of SPIO-labeled cells is highly dependent on powerful attractive forces generated by an externally applied magnetic field.49 In this study, we developed a relatively novel cell delivery system using a NdFeB permanent magnet. Influenced by the magnetic force, a large number of labeled cells align and concentrate themselves at the edge of the magnet, in vitro, to form three-dimensional cellular structures. Therefore, it is logical to surmise that magnetic targeting can promote the aggregation of cells at lesions, and eventually achieve a more efficient therapeutic response with a minimal dosage of transplanted cells.\nIn this study, the properties of SPIO as a magnetic nanoparticle for targeting cells were described, and at the same time used as an MRI contrast agent.50–53 Here, PKH was employed to further verify MRI tracking results. After labeling, Mag-PKH-ADSCs can be monitored by both MRI detection and fluorescence imaging. For MRI, labeled Mag-PKH-ADSCs present as a hypointense signal on T2 images. MRI results were further confirmed by Prussian blue and IF staining of corresponding tissue. Transplanted cells could differentiate into muscle lineage cells in vivo, in agreement with previous literature.30 Magnetically guided targeting provides an optimal cell delivery strategy to enhance cell retention, localization, and\nsurvival, and achieve superior therapeutic effects for SUI with low cell dosages. Prussian blue staining did not reveal increased biodistribution of SPIO nanoparticles in various organs (including heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and brain). No pathological abnormalities or other anomalies were observed by histological examination of major organs. Both IF staining and Prussian blue staining showed that Mag-PKH-ADSCs were largely distributed in the initial injection site. Therefore, magnetic targeting technique increases retention of cells at the target sites, which is suitable for cell-based therapy. Considering iron overload from SPIO exposure may result in inducing toxicity by generating reactive oxygen species, the concentration range of nanoparticles can be an important factor in applying for labeling cells.\nCompared with traditional direct cell injection, magnetically guided targeting strategy has the ability to increase cell retention and improve tissue structure and function.54 In the current study, we observed significantly increased LPP in both Mag and No Mag groups compared with the PBS group, demonstrating that that transplanted cells could play a positive role in improving the urine-controlling ability of SUI rats. Furthermore, no significant difference in LPP was observed between Mag and the sham groups, indicating that magnetic targeting could effectively enhance cell retention and contribute to additional sphincter function benefits in the rat model of SUI.\nOne limitation of the present study was a lack of observed differences in therapeutic efficacy when varying the strength/ magnitude of the magnetic force. As such, the optimal magnetic force and duration of cellular magnetic targeting should be explored further and clarified in additional studies. In addition, a 2-month evaluation period is too limited in duration to examine the ultimate fate of transplanted magnetized cells at the injection site. Thus, the mechanism of action, retention of cells over a longer time course, and long-term safety of transplanted cells will be the focus of our future study.\nIn summary, SPIO can safely be used for cell labeling and imaging without affecting cell viability. SPIO-labeled cells demonstrated apparent aggregation in regions with applied magnetic force. Magnetic targeting also enhanced cell retention at the injection lesion and improved urethral sphincter structure and function. Further work will focus on developing a relatively homogeneous three-dimensional magnetic field and exploring optimal magnetic field intensity to achieve enhanced therapeutic efficiency while utilizing the minimal cell dosage necessary. We believe that this magnetically guided targeting strategy has great potential for treatment of SUI in the future."

Applying a magnetically controlled cell delivery approach has enormous potential to enhance cell retention capability within the specified site. To assess the therapeutic efficacy of cellular magnetic targeting, we applied an external magnetic force to target an adipose-derived stem cell based therapy in a rat model of SUI. The results revealed that magnetic attraction of transplanted cells under the magnetic field was generated by cell uptake of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in vitro. More importantly, magnetic targeting improved the retention rate of transplanted cells and facilitated the restoration of sphincter structure and function in a rat SUI model according to the results of histological examination and urodynamic testing. Therefore, magnetically guided targeting strategy might be a potential therapy method for treatment of SUI. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
