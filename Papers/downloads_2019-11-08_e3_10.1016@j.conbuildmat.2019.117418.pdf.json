Mercury intrusion tests (MIP) indicated that not only the porosity but also the critical pore size decreased with the increase of NC content up to 3%, beyond which the porosity increased due to the agglomerate of NC. Finally, the morphologies of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fiber surfaces and fibermatrix interfaces were observed by scanning electron microscope. At the meso-scale, single fiber pullout tests were conducted and verified that the frictional stress between fiber and matrix reached the maximum value with NC content of 3%, which was in accordance with the results of MIP tests. At the macroscale, the optimal NC dosage to enhance the compressive, tensile and flexural properties of UHP-ECC was found to be 3%, which was strongly supported by the results obtained at micro- and meso-scale. Hence, intense linkages between the micro-, meso- and macro-scale performances of UHP-ECC were exhibited, and the micro- and meso-scale properties induced a decisive impact on the mechanical properties of UHP-ECC at composites level.\n2019 Elsevier Ltd.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Ultra-high Performance Concrete (UHPC) with outstanding compressive strength (>120 MPa) [1] and durability has attracted increasing attention owing to its ability in providing additional strength safety margins for structures and reducing the structural weight to about 1/3–1/2 of that of normal reinforced concrete structures [35]. Besides, engineered cementitious composites (ECC) has also attracted increasing attention\ndue to its excellent ductility with tensile strain capacity of up to 3–5% and multiple cracking behavior with controlled widths [11,12,16,19,22,30,38,42]. Cementitious materials combining obvious strain-hardening and multiple cracking behaviors of ECC with the extremely high compressive strength of UHPC to generate ultra-high performance engineered cementitious composites (UHP-ECC) have been developed recently [9,10,19,39,41,43]. UHP-ECC has an exceptional combination of mechanical properties with the compressive strength up to 120 MPa, the tensile strength and the strain capacity close to 20 MPa and 8%, respectively [42].\nThe cement dosage in UHP-ECC matrix is obviously higher than that in traditional concrete due to the absence of coarse\naggregates. However, an extensive amount of cement acts as expensive filler due to the low hydration rate in this system. Supplementary materials such as limestone powder (CaCO3) have been commonly used to replace cement within the range of 5– 15% [3,23,36]. Application of CaCO3 could improve various properties of cementitious materials, such as accelerating C3S and C2S hydration and stabilizing ettringite [6,8,24]. Additionally, CaCO3 acting as physical inert fillers in cement can improve the density of particle packing and thus the compressive strength [23]. Although CaCO3 does not exhibit pozzolanic property to produce C-S-H gels [25], it can accelerate the formation of hydration products (mainly C-S-H gels) as soon as hydration starts due to the seeding effect [5,33]. In addition, it is known that CaCO3 can react with C3A and C3S and accelerate their hydration rate. The reaction products of CaCO3 with C3S include C-S-H gels, CH and calcium carbosilicate hydrates [14]. The reaction between CaCO3 and C3A is limited because of the extremely low aluminate phase in cement, and CH is consumed to produce hemicarboaluminates and monocarboaluminates [37].\nIt is known that in order to generate a high compressive strength, low water/binder ratio is usually adopted in UHP-ECC matrix [9,42], leading to an extremely low porosity accompanied with tiny pores of nano-size. Thus, nano-sized particles such as nano-CaCO3 (NC), nano-SiO2, nano-TiO2, nano-Al2O3 and carbon nano-tube [29,32,34] would behave more effective in such a density system in term of filling effect. In addition, it should be noted that the price of NC is much lower than other nano-sized particles and it is richness in natural resources, which would ensure its wide application in practical engineering ([16,18,31]). Previous studies mainly focused on the compressive properties of NC modified UHPC and the results showed that NC acting as effective filling materials could increase both the early-age [7] and normalage compressive strength of UHPC ([23,15,18]). Thus, it is also expected that besides the compressive strength, the densification of the matrix by NC modification could also influence the frictional strength between the fiber and matrix, which would consequently affect the tensile and flexural properties of cementitious composites. In general, the structure of cementitious materials can be dispersed into three multi-scale phases: micro-, meso-, and macro-, and the macro-properties of cementitious materials are governed by their micro- and meso-structure properties. Hence, a systematical analysis on the influences of NC on the microstructure at micro-scale, the interfacial bond stress between fiber and matrix at meso-scale, and finally the mechanical properties at composites level of UHP-ECC is meaningful, and the inherent relations of the multi-scale performances of UHP-ECC remains to be revealed.\nThe effects of NC on the multi-scale properties of UHP-ECC are investigated in this research. At the micro-scale, the hydration kinetics of UHP-ECC matrices with different amounts of NC were compared using the isothermal calorimetry. The phase development of matrices was quantified by the thermal gravimetric analysis/differential thermal gravimetric analysis. Besides, the mercury intrusion porosity (MIP) tests were also conducted to evaluate the influence of NC contents on both the porosity and pore size distribution of UHP-ECC. Microstructures of the composites, especially the fiber-matrix interfaces and fiber surfaces were observed by scanning electronic microscope (SEM). At the meso-scale, single fiber pullout tests were conducted to illustrate the influence of NC on the interfacial stress between fiber and matrix, through which the linkage between the micro-scale and the macro-scale properties of UHP-ECC was established. At the macro-scale, the mechanical properties (i.e., the compressive strength, tensile and flexural properties) of UHP-ECC with different NC contents (i.e., 0–4%) were evaluated."

The addition of GGBS and SF featuring with pozzolanic property could promote the formation of secondary hydration products (C-S-H gels). Fine silica sands with a maximum grain size of 181 lm and a mean size of 100 lm were used to enhance the mechanical properties of UHP-ECC. The particle size distributions of SF, GGBS, LP, PC and sand are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the sizes of these selected fine particles increased successively. As a result, the increased particle packing density strengthens the aggregate-cement matrix interface and the fiber-matrix interface. The basic properties of the cementitious materials (i.e., PC, SF, GGBS and LP) are given in Table 1.\nNC particles with varying contents (i.e., 0, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%) were added to illustrate their effects on multi-scale properties of UHP-ECC. The particle size of NC was in the range from 20 to 300 nm. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that unlike the fly ash, the particles of NC were neither spherical nor smooth. Instead, they contained sharp corners and irregular edges, which were similar to the shape of GGBS. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) results of NC are shown in Fig. 3 with a typical peak occurring at around 800 C.\nPE fibers with properties as listed in Table 2 were used to reinforce the high strength UHP-ECC matrix. The tensile strength, Young’s modulus and tensile elongation at breakage of PE fibers were 2400 MPa, 100 GPa and 2–3%, respectively. PE fibers were 18 mm in length and 24 lm in diameter, resulting in a Lf/df of 750, which was much higher than that of the normally used PVA fiber of around 300 [16]. A higher Lf/df ratio generated larger fiber/matrix interfacial area at the same fiber volume fraction which would increase the fiber-bridging capacity [27,21]."

The specimens were demolded 72 h later to ensure a high strength and thus avoid matrix fracture caused by demolding.

      "text" : "The hydration kinetics of UHP-ECC matrices were monitored by the isothermal calorimetry. The effect of NC contents on the heat evolution rate occurred in the first 48 h of UHP-ECC matrices is shown in Fig. 6. Apart from shortening the dormant period, the addition of NC also resulted in the advance of the second peak. As shown in Fig. 6a, the dormant period of the UHP-ECC without NC addition was around 11 h, and the addition of NC reduced this period to about 7 h. These can be attributed to the nucleation and chemical effects generated by NC [23,14]. The NC particles acting as the nucleation sites in the matrix could absorb Ca2+ released from C3S rapidly when in contact with water, which would decrease the concentration of Ca2+ around C3S and consequently accelerate the hydration rate. In addition, NC could react with C3A to form carboaluminates featuring with high permeability, which could provide internal space for water and ions to diffuse into [8] and thus decrease the concentration of Ca2+ and increase the hydration rate. Nevertheless, it should be noticed that the NC4 matrix had lower heat of hydration than that of the NC3 matrix, which might be due to that a large amount of nano-sized particles could agglomerate and generate adverse influence on heat evolution rate. Fig. 6b shows the heat release normalized per gram of cementitious material. The NC3 matrix had the highest total cumulative heat due to the nucleation and chemical effects of NC, while more NC content would induce a negative influence on\nhydration. The other two matrices, i.e., NC0 and NC1, had a comparable total cumulative heat up to 48 h."

It is interpreted from the DTG curve that: (1) the first endothermal peak is corresponded with the dehydration of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) and ettringite at approximately 80–90 C and 130 C, respectively; (2) the second typical endothermal peak at around 400–500 C represents the decomposition of calcium hydroxide (CH), Ca (OH)2 ? CaO + H2O; (3) the third endothermal peak emerged between 600 and 700 C is related to the decomposition of CaCO3 with CO2 escaping [40,4]. It can be seen from Fig. 7b that the endothermal peak intensity as well as the covered range at all three temperature ranges, including 50–150 C, 400–500 C, and\n600–700 C, were almost identical for the samples with and without NC addition. However, the slight difference between the control and the NC modified UHP-ECC matrices could be reflected from the total mass loss up to 1000 C in the TG curves as shown in Fig. 7a. It is clear that the mass loss increased with the increasing NC content up to 3%, suggesting that a large amount of NC particles acting as physical inert fillers in UHPECC [29,40]."

It can be seen from Fig. 8a, the total porosity decreased from 5.0% to 3.2% as the NC content increased from 0% to 3%. However, a further increase of NC content to 4% caused an increase of the total porosity to 4.4%. Although NC could fill the nano-sized pores in the hydrated cement paste efficiently,\nexcessive amount of such nano-particles could agglomerate and lead to an increase in porosity.\nAs shown in Fig. 8b, the differential pore size distribution curves of three UHP-ECC mixtures were almost overlapped covering pore size from 40 to 100000 nm. However, it can be seen that the curves for UHP-ECC containing NC shifted to left when the pore size was\nsmaller than 40 nm, indicating more finer pores in NC modified UHP-ECC than in the control sample (NC0). Furthermore, the peak value on the dv/dlog(d) curve, representing the critical pore size decreased with NC addition. These results illustrate that the addition of moderate amount of NC (up to 3%) efficiently reduced the porosity and refined the pores, and thus improving the particle\npacking density of UHP-ECC. Moreover, from Fig. 8b it is found that the critical pore size of UHP-ECC without NC modification (NC0) was around 10 nm, meaning that finer nano-particles than that of NC used in this research may exhibit more effective to refine the pore structure at micro-scale and enhance the mechanical properties at macro-scale of UHP-ECC system studied in this research with extremely tiny critical pore size, which could be further studied in the future work.\nFig. 8c shows the pore volume distribution of the UHP-ECC matrix with different contents of NC. The pores can be divided into four groups according to their size, i.e., gel micro-pores (<10 nm), meso-pores (10–50 nm), middle capillary pores (50–100 nm), large capillary pores (100–5000 nm), and macro-pores (>5000 nm) [45]. As shown in Fig. 8c, the incorporation of NC increased the volume of micro-pores and meso-pores of with 3% addition compared to that of NC0, demonstrating the refinement of the microstructure. In addition, the percentage of macro-pores was very limited for the three UHP-ECC mixtures, corresponding to the extremely high strengths of these mixtures."

The load decreased sharply once debonding happened, and then increased again showing a slip hardening behavior. The majority of fibers were pulled out from the matrices.\nFig. 10 shows the frictional stress between the fiber and matrix of UHP-ECC with different NC contents.

The average values of interfacial bond stresses were 1.19, 1.37, 1.51 and 1.34 MPa for NC0, NC1, NC3 and NC4, respectively. The enhancement of interfacial bond stress with NC addition up to 3% obtained at meso-scale could be attributed to the densification of particle packing and the refinement of pore structure at microscale as illustrated in detail in Section 3.3.

Further improvement on peak stress was not observed when the addition of NC increased to 4%. It is known that the tensile properties of mortars were significantly affected by both the characteristics of the micro-structure of hydrated cement and the interfacial transition zones (ITZs) between PE fibers and hydrated cement. The incorporation of NC obviously increased the packing density in both the cementitious matrix and the ITZs at micro-scale as stated in Section 3.3, which could result in the higher tensile strength of UHP-ECC at composites level. Moreover, the higher interfacial bond stress between fiber and matrix due to NC addition as verified in Section 3.4 could further increase the tensile strength of the composites. However, an overdose of NC would lead to an uneven dispersion which would result in less significant improvement on tensile strength. The ratios of tensile peak stress to compressive strength increased from 7.8% of NC0 to 10.1% of NC3, demonstrating that the enhancement on tensile strength of UHP-ECC with NC addition was more remarkable than that on compressive strength. The relationship between the strain energy of UHP-ECC and NC contents (see in Fig. 14b) showed a similar trend with that of the tensile strength. The strain energy increased from 645.2 kJ/m3 to 940.2 kJ/m3 (i.e., with a 45.7% increase) when the NC content increased from 0% to 3%. Higher fiber/matrix frictional strength caused by the addition of NC would generate higher energy consumption during fiber pullout process compared to that of the control sample (NC0).\nAs shown in Fig. 14c, the strain capacity of all UHP-ECC exceeded 7.6%, which was much larger than that of PVA-ECC [16]. It is noticed that the addition of 1–2% NC had a slight influence on the strain capacity of UHP-ECC. However, when the NC content increased to 3–4%, its effect on the improvement of the\nstrain capacity became more obvious (i.e., 10.3–19.3% increase). In addition, the average crack numbers within gauge length (see in Fig. 14d) generally increased from 46 to 53 when the NC contents increased from 0% to 4%. The residual crack widths of UHPECC specimens with and without NC modification were less than 150 lm, which were within the crack width limitation for the concrete structure under severe environments such as seawater or wetting and drying condition according to ACI 224R [2].

As shown in Fig. 16, tightly spaced cracks were formed on the lower face of the beam. All these results indicated the ability of UHP-ECC to redistribute stresses and undergo multiple cracking before fiber pullout.\nof UHP-ECC with different NC contents.\nThe relationships between the flexural parameters of UHP-ECC, including the peak stress and the external energy consumption, corresponding to the deflection/span ratio of 1/50, 1/100 with different NC contents are illustrated in Fig. 17. The flexural strength of UHP-ECC increased steadily by 11.7–27.0% compared to that of the control sample (i.e., 22.2 MPa) when the dosage of NC increased from 1% to 3%. Further increase of NC content to 4% had a marginal\ninfluence on the flexural strength of UHP-ECC, which shared a similar trend with that of the tensile strength. Besides, the variation of external energy consumption of UHP-ECC specimens with NC content was also identical to that of the flexural strength. Moreover, the ratios of flexural strength to compressive strength increased from 17.2% of NC0 to 20.3% of NC3, which would help to alleviate the brittleness of high strength UHP-ECC.\nECC with different NC contents.\nces and fiber-matrix interfaces."

      "text" : "Fig. 18 shows the SEM observations of the fracture surfaces of UHP-ECC mixtures, including unmodified UHP-ECC and 3% NC modified UHP-ECC, respectively. As shown in Fig. 18a, fiber ends were blunt and fiber surfaces were mostly smooth with a certain amount of fibrillation of the unmodified UHP-ECC specimen. For UHP-ECC specimen with NC content of 3% (see in Fig. 18b), fiber surfaces were rough and fiber ends were delaminated ruptured which would result in higher frictional stress. All these results obtained at micro-scale could provide proof and were coincident well with those properties obtained from single fiber pull out test at meso-level as stated in Section 3.4. Based on the analytic model developed by Lin et al. [20], Li et al. [17] pointed out that an optimum range of frictional stress existed to obtain steady-state crack propagation at a certain matrix toughness. When the frictional stress is smaller than the minimum value, fiber pullout facilitates; whereas fiber rupture or premature failure happens when the frictional stress is larger than the maximum value. In other words, when the frictional stress locates within the optimum range, the improvement on the frictional stress will increase the slip hardening behavior and lead to a higher pullout resistance of the fibers. Therefore, the balance between a high percentage of fiber pullout and a small percentage of fiber rupture would enhance both tensile strength and ductility of the composites. According to the morphology of PE fibers, it is likely that the percentage of fiber rupture might be slightly higher due to the higher frictional stress in NC modified UHP-ECC than in the control sample while did not surpass full fracture. Hence, the tensile strength as well as the tensile strain capacity and the flexural strength of NC modified UHP-ECC would be higher than those of the control sample (NC) as discussed in Sections 3.6 and 3.7."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "In the present research, a systematical analysis on the influences of nano-CaCO3 (NC) addition on the microstructure, the interfacial bond stress, and the mechanical properties of UHPECC was conducted, and the inherent relations between the micro-, meso-, and macro-scale performances of UHP-ECC were illustrated. The following conclusions can be drawn:\n(1) The addition of NC accelerated the heat of hydration of UHPECC. The dormant period was shortened, and the second peak was advanced. The slight mass loss difference between the control and NC modified UHP-ECC matrices in the TG curves proved the filler effect of NC. MIP results showed that the addition of moderate NC (up to 3%) efficiently reduced the porosity and refined the pores. According to the SEM observations, the incorporation of NC generated rough PE fiber surfaces and delaminated fiber ends which would result in higher interfacial friction. (2) The average interfacial stress between the fiber and matrix obtained through single fiber pullout tests at meso-scale first increased with the addition of NC up to 3% and then decreased slightly, which were strongly proofed by the results obtained at micro-scale including the morphologies of PE fiber surfaces and the pore structures and provided supports of the mechanical performances at composites level. (3) The addition of NC improved the compressive strength of UHP-ECC because of the filling effect and the chemical effect associated with NC, and an optimal dosage of 3% existed. Additionally, the tensile peak strength, strain capacity, strain energy as well as the flexural peak strength of UHP-ECC all\nincreased with the addition of NC up to 3%. All these mechanical performances of UHP-ECC at composites level can be explained by the properties at micro- (i.e., morphologies of fibers and MIP tests) and meso-scale (i.e., single fiber pullout tests). (4) The mechanical properties of UHP-ECC at composites level were affected and can be optimized through altering their smaller scale properties.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."

    "abstractText" : "This paper investigated the effects of nano-CaCO3 (NC) with different contents (i.e., 0–4% by mass of cement) on hydration, micro-structure and mechanical properties of ultra-high performance engineered cementitious composites (UHP-ECC) and clarified the inherent relations of multi-scale performances of UHP-ECC. At the micro-scale, the heat evolution analysis was firstly conducted and the results showed that NC accelerated the heat of hydration of UHP-ECC matrices due to its nucleation and dilution effect. Then, the phase developments of NC modified UHP-ECC matrices were discussed using the thermal gravimetric analysis/differential thermal gravimetric analysis, which proved the filler effect of NC. Mercury intrusion tests (MIP) indicated that not only the porosity but also the critical pore size decreased with the increase of NC content up to 3%, beyond which the porosity increased due to the agglomerate of NC. Finally, the morphologies of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fiber surfaces and fibermatrix interfaces were observed by scanning electron microscope. At the meso-scale, single fiber pullout tests were conducted and verified that the frictional stress between fiber and matrix reached the maximum value with NC content of 3%, which was in accordance with the results of MIP tests. At the macroscale, the optimal NC dosage to enhance the compressive, tensile and flexural properties of UHP-ECC was found to be 3%, which was strongly supported by the results obtained at microand meso-scale. Hence, intense linkages between the micro-, mesoand macro-scale performances of UHP-ECC were exhibited, and the microand meso-scale properties induced a decisive impact on the mechanical properties of UHP-ECC at composites level. 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
