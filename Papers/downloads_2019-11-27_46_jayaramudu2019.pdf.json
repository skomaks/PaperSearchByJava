      "text" : "In current decades, the development of cost-effective antibacterial nanoparticles (NPs) and their derivative nanocomposites have gained significant attention for several industrial applications, particularly in biomedical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, drug delivery and antimicrobial applications [1,2]. NPs have notable physical, chemical, and advanced medical features as well as high potential use in many fields including healthcare application. Nanotechnology is considered as a major integral part in the present ongoing research of the NPs synthesis. Currently, various synthesis techniques have been reported, which include UV irradiation reduction [3], laser ablation [4], microwave processing [5], thermal decomposition [6], electrolysis [7], ion implantation [8,9] and chemical reduction methods [10]. In addition, polymers have been playing a pivotal role in the synthesis and stabilization to acquire the desired shape and size of the metal NPs [11–14]. Among various polymers, biopolymer-stabilized metal NPs have gained significant importance\ndu@gmail.com (T. Jayaramudu),\nin medical applications due to their unique functional properties such as biocompatibility and eco-friendly nature [15,16].\nInclusion of metal NPs into the biopolymers can change properties of the base materials [13]. Moreover, biopolymer-stabilized NPs are opening up a new era of research due to high aspect ratio, low densities and multifunctional characteristics, which makes them suitable for advanced applications especially in antimicrobial and wound dressing [17,18]. Biopolymers not only minimize the production cost of NPs and also control the morphology of NPs [19,20]. Among the existing metals and biopolymers, copper (Cu) and chitosan biological macromolecule (CH) have been selected for the synthesis of NPs for advanced antibacterial applications in biomedicine. CH is a biopolymer composed of β-(1 → 4)-2-amino2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose and it is a natural cationic biopolymer obtained from deacetylation of chitin by a thermochemical reaction [21]. CH has excellent properties such as film-forming ability, good adhesion, nontoxicity and biocompatibility [22–25].\nCH has hydroxyl and amino functional groups in their chemical structure. These groups are playing a vital role in the usage of CH in various applications such as biomedical, drug delivery, antimicrobial, wastewater treatment, ion-exchange and functional matrixes for industries [26,27]. Principally, CH has a reducing capacity and significant bacteriostatic/bactericidal property aswell [28,29]. Due to these properties,\nCH has been widely used as a dressing material on wounds and burns. CH stabilized Cu-based materials have been principally considered as active antimicrobial agents. This is attributed to the formation of an internal coordination bond between the Cu and CH functional groups. There are many literature reports on the synthesis of CH-based CuO or Cu NPs and studied these materials towards antimicrobial and other technological applications [30–36]. According to the literature, chemical reduction method is a facile process for the synthesis of NPs using biopolymeric materials [37–42] in achieving a better substantial bacteriostatic/bactericidal property. CH mediated flowery-CuO NPs have been reported by an in situ method using ammonia solution via a microwave-induced method and suggested that a low concentration of CH is suitable to formulate oxide metal NPs since the high concentration of CH formed precipitation in the presence of basic media [43]. In another report, copper oxide based chitosan nanocomposite hydrogel beads have been prepared from in situ methods which displayed excellent antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gramnegative bacteria [37]. Chitosan-Cu NPs were synthesized via a green chemical process which were further used in emulsion paints to coat the surface of wood and mild steel panels to inhibit the growth of the algae [44]. However, the nanocomposite films of CH capped CuO/Cu NPs and their derivatives were not yet reported in the literature.\nIn this investigation, two different kinds of microbial resistant CH capped CuO-chitosan (CHCuO-CH) and CH capped Cu-chitosan (CHCu-CH) nanocomposite films were prepared via a solution casting technique. Here, CH capped CuO and Cu NPs were synthesized by a facile chemical reduction using sodium hydroxide and ascorbic acid as nucleation agents. These nanomaterials were characterized with ATRFTIR, UV–vis, XRD and their antimicrobial activity was studied against E. coli and Bacillus."

Then, 5.0 g of CuSO4·5H2O was dissolved in 100 mL of double distilled water in a 250 mL round bottom flask. To this solution, 20 g of CH stock solution was added slowly under constant stirring using a magnetic stirrer with 300 rpm over a period of 30 min. After forming the homogeneous mixture, the reaction temperature was increased to 85 °C with continuous stirring for 45 min. After that, the solution pH was adjusted to ~9 by the gradual addition of sodium hydroxide (0.625M) and the solution color changed to dark blue colloidal, at this moment 20 mL of 0.4258 M ascorbic acid solution was added slowly [44]. Then, the solution color changed to yellow beforefinally becoming red. The stirringwas continued for another 30min. The solution was cooled and washed repeatedly with double distilled water and centrifuged at 8000 rpm, dried in a vacuum oven. A similar procedure was used for the preparation of CHCuO NPs but without using the ascorbic acid. Fig. 1 shows the schematic preparation and formation of the CHCuO and CHCu NPs. Finally, the prepared CHCuO and CHCu NPs were stored in vacuum desiccators until to be used.\n2.3. Preparation of CHCuO-CH and CHCu-CH films\nA simple solvent evaporation process was used to prepare chitosanbased nanocomposites. In this process, 20 mg of both CHCuO and CHCu NPs were re-dispersed in 5 mL of 1.5% v/v aq. acetic acid. Then, a solution of 0.6 g CH in 40 mL of 1.5% aq. acetic acid was added to the above solution and the stirring was continued using a magnetic stirrer with 300 rpm over a period of 12 h. To this solution, a 0.3 mL of 2% aqueous glutaraldehyde solution was added and the stirring was continued another 30 min, then poured into a Petri dish and kept in an oven at 35 °C. For comparison purposes, the pure CH film was prepared by following the above procedure. The developed nanocomposite films were named as the pure CH, CHCuO-CH and CHCu-CH nanocomposite films, respectively. The dried films were peeled off from the Petri dish plate and dried in a vacuum oven at 35 °C for 48 h before characterizations."

From Fig. 2A, the pure CH shows a broad characteristic peak at 3324 cm−1 related to the stretching vibration of -OH and -NH groups. The peaks at 2921 and 2871 cm−1 correspond to symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of –CH3, respectively. The peaks at 1636 and 1555 cm−1 correspond to the carbonyl stretching of the secondary amide and bending vibration of the -NH groups. The peaks between 1377, 1420 and 1000–1200 cm−1 were associated to the stretching vibrations of the polysaccharides chain (-C-N- and -C-O-) functional groups [43,47]. However, the CH characteristic peak wavenumbers were shifted after the formation of CHCuO and CHCu NPs. For example, the CHCuO shows a broad peak at 3334 cm−1 and CHCu shows a peak at 3433 cm−1. Similarly, the other CH characteristic peak wavenumbers were also shifted, and these results specify that the CH was wellcapped to the CuO and Cu NPs. Fig. 2B shows the FTIR spectra of CHCuO-CH and CHCu-CH nanocomposite films. From Fig. 2B, the CHCuO-CH and CHCu-CH nanocomposite films show a sharp and broad -OH stretching vibration peaks at 3250 and 3243 cm−1; these peaks were slightly shifted in their wavenumber when compared with pure CH film (3324 cm−1) as well as their CHCuO and CHCu. These are attributed to the coordination bond formation between the CH capped CHCuO and CHCu and CH."

From Fig. 3A CHCuO NPs display an absorption peak at ∼289 nm [48]. These results reveal that the CHCuONPs were successfully formed by the use of NaOH as a\nreducing agent. Furthermore, by the addition of the ascorbic acid to the above reaction, the oxidation reaction was hindered, and the absorption band disappeared (∼289 nm). The increased intensity at ∼575 nm (Fig. 3B) [49], which is attributed to the band-to-band transition, indicated the presence of Cu NPs.

In the same way, the CH peak (20.50°) was observed and was shown in the inset (Fig. 3C iii). But the CH peak was not visible along with characteristic peaks of Cu NPs. It was due to the low intensity of CH and this peak was dominated by characteristic peaks of Cu NPs in the XRD.

Themaximum swelling capacity was achieved in 5 h and then the values became constant up to 7 h. However, the pure CH film showed a higher swelling trend than that of CHCuO-CH and CHCu-CH nanocomposite films. This was due to the enormous crosslinking and tightening between the polymeric chains, which led to the rigid structure and avoided the penetration of water molecules. In addition, the swelling behavior depends on other factors such as the content of filler, crosslinking and porosity [46]. In this investigation, the swelling ratio capacity of the nanocomposite filmswas decreased by the formation of the coordination bond between the functional groups of chitosan and CHCuO/CHCu NPs."

      "text" : "Over the past few decades, various metal NPs such as silver, gold, zinc and copper were investigated towards antimicrobial applications [43,45,57–60]. However, there is no exact mechanism to explain how metal NPs act and kill the bacteria. Nevertheless, a possible mechanism\nis reported in the literature considering the formation of pits [61,62]. It was proposed that themetal NPs initially attach to the cellwall and then they damage the membrane of the bacteria cell wall, which causes the formation of pits. Subsequently, the formed pits inhibit the growth of the bacteria. Among such nanomaterials, copper-based metal NPs have gained much attention in antimicrobial applications [62–64]. Fig. 8 shows the antimicrobial activity of synthesized CHCuO, CHCu and nanocomposite films (CH, CHCuO-CH and CHCu-CH) against two bacteria such as gram-negative and gram-positive. Inhibition efficiency of these nanomaterials was calculated via the formation of the inhibition zone after 48 h at 37 °C. The whole experiment was carried out in the incubation chamber. Fig. 8A shows the antimicrobial activity against E. coli bacteria with the inhibition zone values of 1.6 cm for CHCuo, 1.4 cm for CHCu, 1.0 cm for CHCuO-CH nanocomposite film and 0.6 cm for CHCu-CH nanocomposite film. Fig. 8B shows the antimicrobial activity against the Bacillus, and their inhibition zone values are 1.3 cm for CHCuo, 0.9 cm for CHCu, 0.75 cm for CHCuO-CH nanocomposite film and 0.5 cm for CHCu-CH nanocomposite film. These results concluded that the CHCuO NPs possessed higher inhibition zone values compared to the CHCu NPs. In addition to that, inhibition efficiency of these NPs was better against E. coli bacteria compared to Bacillus. Similar results were observed with the fabricated nanocomposite films. These results are in good agreement with the earlier research reports, which confirm that CuO NPs have much better antimicrobial activity than the Cu NPs [43,65]. A similar trend in results was observed in the case of nanocomposite films. From the results, we can conclude\nthat the nanocomposite films showed higher inhibition capacity on gram-negative bacteria. The inhibition capacity may depend on the cell wall surface of bacteria as well as the functionality of nanocomposites (size, shape, cationic and anionic). The developed chitosan-based cationic nanocomposite films have active oxygen- and nitrogen-based functional groups. In addition, the films have reactive oxygen species derived fromCHCuO. It waswell proven in the literature that chitosan derivatives have been significantly inhibiting the grampositive bacterias [66]."

The developed nanomaterials were systematically characterized using ATR-FTIR, UV–Vis and XRD. The XRD data confirmed that the synthesized materials did not have any side products. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that CHCu NPs had higher thermal stability than the CHCuO NPs.\nFurthermore, the percentage of CuO and Cu was found as 56.21% and 98.92%, respectively. The surface morphology, elemental analysis and particle sizes were studied using SEM-EDS and TEM. TEM studies revealed that the formed CHCuO NPs had nanoflakes and CHCu NPs had spherical structure. The synthesized nanomaterial showed excellent antimicrobial activity against E. coli and Bacillus. CHCuO NPs and the corresponding nanocomposite (CHCuO-CH) film showed stronger antimicrobial activity compared to the CHCu NPs and their nanocomposite (CHCu-CH) films. Based on these results, the synthesized CuO/Cu NPs and nanocomposites could be used for antimicrobial applications."
