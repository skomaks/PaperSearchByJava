The ZnO-NHs were grown on ITO glass substrate via a low-cost hydrothermal method followed by annealing at different seeding temperatures, respectively. A correlation has been established between annealing temperature and the defect level concerning the diameter and density of ZnO-NH verified by Raman and FE-SEM images analysis. A further coating of the gold layer over ZnO-NH via thermal evaporator exhibits the plasmonic field enhancement in visible range which revives after short rapid annealing treatment. The enhancement is due to the large surface area of the sensing area on the haxagonrods shape and robust plasmonic coupling between metal and ZnO which efficiently detects fluorescence signal of Rhodamine 6G(R6G) molecules. A drastic change of tunable enhanced signal was resulted by AuNPs size and morphology and elucidated by suitable energy diagram observed from quenching to highly enhanced signal using photoluminescence spectrum and its related linearity plot. Carried out in three different thicknesses of AuNPs spotting on ZnO-NH, 3, 5 and 7 nm, it was observed that 3 nm AuNPs resulted in six times higher enhancement of output signal at seeding temperature of 500o than the 5 and 7 nm gold NPs spotted ZnO-NH at same experimental conditions. By the proposed structure, a significant photoluminescence and plasmonics enhancement, the ease of tunability, and higher uniformity were achieved by the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) from the AuNPs-decorated ZnO-NH and annealing process. Overall, the AuNPs- ZnO-NH hybrid offers a low-cost and simple fabrication potentially applied in a high-sensitive smart surface plasmonic optical sensor applications and can be a representative of new generations of photodiodes, solar cells, and metamaterials."

      "text" : "Over the last decades, the development of plasmonic integrated devices has attracted interest for manipulating light in the nanoscale region [1–4]. Moreover, highly enhanced surface plasmons (SPs) facilitated emissions have been fascinating as seen in a wide range of general research interests in developing the band emission of ZnO modeled metal-semiconductor nano plasmonic-based nanostructure and its related application for chemical and biology species [5,6].\nAmong them, a metal-semiconductor study in localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) has been greatly enticing due to the rapid development of plasmonics, stability, nontoxicity, and biocompatibility of the material in the sensor surface [7–9].\nOn the other hand, the study of the wide- and direct-bandgap material plays an important role in the development of photonic sensor as well as applications in solar cell and light emitting diode [10–13]. For example, the application of zinc oxide (ZnO) with its wide direct\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2019.03.020 Received 27 November 2018; Received in revised form 15 February 2019; Accepted 5 March 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author at: Electronic Engineering, College of Engineering, Chang Gung University, 259 Wen-Hwa 1st Rd, Guishan, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan.

Pertaining to the wide band gap of ZnO which prominently limits the light reacting range and strongly absorbs the ultraviolet range of light, most of the established works showed the trends\nto expand visible light response of ZnO for real-world applications ZnO likely absorbs excitation light which further induces the creation of electron-hole pair together with charge separation. Therefore, the structuring of ZnO nanosurface is one of the excellent methods to enhance both surface area to volume ratio and the photonic activity [14]. Nevertheless, common ZnO material suffers from defects as a result of impurities on its surface which consequently narrows down the band emission. From this point of view, the minimization of the defects is crucial to obtain the ZnO optimum emission properties.\nNumbers of the latest studies have revealed that some essential properties of metal oxide semiconductors are thoroughly associated with intrinsic defects and extrinsic impurities [15,16]. However, oxygen vacancy is one of the greatest prevalent defects which can be presented into wide bandgap semiconductors to proficiently expand optical absorption range and enhance the activity of surface concerning optical sensor applications [15,16]. Wang et al. reported that oxygen vacancy could simply be formed during ZnO synthesis and the number of oxygen vacancy could be controlled by changing the annealing procedures at higher temperature [17]. These phenomena can be attributed to the decrease of the oxygen vacancies from the surface with\nthe improvement of ZnO structure as well as strong enhancement performance of the LSPR-based biosensor [18].\nLSPR is an electromagnetic oscillation created in the vicinity of noble metal nanostructures, and it is a collective oscillation model of the free conduction band electrons at the interface of noble metal NPs (Au, Ag and Cu) and semiconductor [19]. In this work, we aim to generate the LSPR field through the AuNPs decoration over ZnO-NH. This method successfully improves the plasmonic model for a high advancement strategy towards optoelectronics application. In this regard, a comprehensive investigations have presented that the composition of metal-semiconductor model correlated to the size and shape of noble metal NPs is pivotal in defining the photocatalytic efficiency of the nanohybrids materials as well as surface plasmon sensor [20].\nThe hybrid of semiconductors materials and metallic NPs typically provides an easy route of preparation and practical applications. Nanostructuring with different size, thickness and morphological structure of nanoparticles on a substrate emphasizes the idea towards downscaling and miniaturization towards signal augmentation [21]. For instance, it is reported that Au-TiO2 photocatalysts enhanced with the 70-nm diameter of AuNPs and was excellently outperformed in comparison with thinner layer of AuNPs. Larger gold NPs enables larger photocatalytic activity under visible light due to stronger plasmonic resonance [22]. Furthermore, an opposite trend of “smaller is better” has been reported by Qian and coworkers who observed an enhanced photocatalytic activity for smaller NPs of 4.4 nm as being compared to the larger size of 67 nm. It was assumed that the smaller NPs yielded a greater negative shift in the Fermi level which favors more effective\nelectron transfer and charge separation [23]. She et al., investigated the effect of NPs size on the plasmonic model as well as photocatalytic activity of gold-ZnO-NH (Au@ZnO-NH) [24]. The possible “trade-off” mechanism between efficient charge transfer for smaller NPs and stronger LSPR effect for a larger one was also presented. In addition, Moirangthem et al. proved that 5 nm gold thickness with NPs size of 45 nm exhibited the highest sensitivity while the sample with average NPs size 96 nm showed the lowest sensitivity with respect to refractive index value [25]. A similar trend in accordance with the higher performance of the smaller particles was also reported by Nath et al., [26]. Moreover, Zheng et al. discovered the potency of AuNPs with the size of 40 nm to retain the highest coupling effect than other NPs size when the separation of AuNPs and SPR sensing film was fixed at 5 nm. The latter work reported that the enhanced SPR sensing signals dropped with the increasing particle size and defined the effectiveness of AuNPs with the size of 40 nm in diameter in amplifying the SPR signal than the bigger NPs size [27]. An important fact denotes the significance of the size and distribution of NPs for the absorption coefficient of the dye molecule where 3 nm and 5 nm thick NPs without annealing were reported to result in stronger absorption than samples with annealing and the 10 nm and 20 nm thick Ag island films were the complete opposite of this tendency [28]. Furthermore, Kim et al. also demonstrated that the quenching efficiency was lowered with the increasing size of the gold nanoparticles and the distance between dye and nanoparticles as displayed in the fluorescence spectra [29]. The reported works mostly pointed out the suitable advance model for smaller NPs size for plasmonic-based fluorescence sensor development.\nIn this work, we demonstrate a simple low cost, AuNPs controlled by RTA with 60 s and large area (1×1 cm2) with high performance based device fabrication firstly combining the temperature effects over ZnO-NH morphology and advantageous features toward the development of defectless ZnO surface. To reinforce the plasmonic activity, the spotting of Au on the ZnO-NH surface was conducted via thermal evaporation to avoid chemical effects over the device. Further improvement of the engineered surface was accomplished by rapid thermal treatment to target the highly predictive nature of the optical device and its enhanced optical performance. The enhanced visible emission due to gold-NPs decorated ZnO-NH, as well as Schottky based junction model and the impact of the size of the AuNPs via short rapid thermal annealing (RTA) with ˜60 s duration [30–33] on photoluminescence performance were scientifically studied step by step. Three device fabrication conditions were targeted for LSPR enhancement such as: (i) Defectless ZnO-NH grown on ITO, (ii) Deposition of the gold islands on ZnO-NH with different thickness and (iii) RTA treatment. Overall, the proposed method paves a way to establish a new model with low cost fabrication device, stable device sensitivity, much faster time, large sensing area and up to 6 times signal enhancement\npotentially applied for smart plasmonic nanosensor."

Initially, the ITO glass substrates were cleaned subsequently in soap water, ethanol, IPA and de-ionized (DI) water in an ultrasonic water bath for 30min each. For seed layer preparation, ITO cleaned glass substrate was wetted with 100 μL of 5mM zinc acetate dehydrate (99%) in ethanol, rinsed with ethanol and then dried with N2 gun. Finally, the coating steps were repeated 5 times until a homogenous coating was obtained for all substrate. After the coating process, the coated substrate was annealed at 400 °C, 450 °C, and 500 °C in an air environment for 30min by oxidation furnace respectively, to create seed layer as well as ZnO nucleation over ITO surface for the growth of ZnO-NH. The ZnO-seeded contained substrate was immersed in a Teflon beaker containing equal molar 25mM concentration of Zn (OAc)2.2H2O and hexamethylenetetramine ((CH2)6N4, HMTA). The aqueous solution was placed in an oven for 95 °C for 8 h [34–36]. In this process, HMTA supplies supplementary OH− while zinc nitrate is the source of Zn2+ ions. Before growth, the substrate was dipped into the above solution with the ZnO seed coated film facing down. The samples were thoroughly washed with DI water to eliminate residual salt or amino complexes and allowed to dry.

      "text" : "The Raman spectrum analysis of the ZnO-NH grown under different seeding temperatures are shown in Fig. 3 with identical spectra, except for the Raman shift at E1 (@580 cm−1. The peak is reduced with the increment of the seeding temperature. It indicates that the oxygen vacancy can be suppressed successfully as well as the improvement of the crystalline structure with decreasing oxygen vacancy [17]. From Fig. 3, it is evidence that the most prominent point seen by the high-intensity sharp and robust peak at 439 cm−1 is attributed to the Raman active optical phonon E2 mode of ZnO confirming the production of ZnO-NH wurtzite hexagonal structure [37]. Another peak at 332 cm−1 represents multiple phonon scattering processes and demonstrates good tunability and suppression at high temperature.\nFig. 4(A, B, C) shows the FE-SEM images of the ZnO-NH growth at\ndifferent seeding temperature and its morphological effects based on NRs diameter and density. The diameter and density of ZnO-NH changes as a consequence of seeding temperature at 400, 450 and 500 °C, respectively, is closely linked with the precursor materials coating over ITO glass [38–43]. After a successive deposition of AuNPs on ZnO-NH, Au-spotted islands over ZnO-NH structures were created as can be observed in Fig. 4 (D, E, and F). Subsequently, as presented in Fig. 4 (G, H, I), the RTA greatly impacted the morphological structures of the AuNPs spotted ZnO-NH as seen in the pattern of Au embedment achieved post-RTA treatment [25,26]. Next, the morphology optimization of AuNPs thickness of 3, 5, and 7 nm on the ZnO-NH is shown in Fig. 4 (J, K, and L).The uniform density and size characteristics of the AuNPs on ZnO-NH are presented in Fig. 5(E, F, G). This result reveals that the high density of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) has been well-distributed on ZnO-NH via RTA treatment. These results and composition of metal with semiconductor are consistent with the operating mechanism and schematic diagram offered in Fig. 2, which fulfill criteria of the occurrence of a Schottky junction based plasmonic model. The figure illustrated surface plasmon mediated model and detection of R6G as the fluorescence emission signal via energy transfer mechanism. In this context, the schematic figure explains in details about the mechanism of plasmon excitation gold NPs over ZnO-NH and suitable energy diagram for electron injection as well as how the transfer of energy fulfills fluorescence signal model [9].\nCompared to the conventional method, such as solution process [44–46], the present fabrication process using thermal evaporation and\nannealing offers several advantages. First, there is no involvement of chemical reagents during the plasmonic process; therefore, it is free from surface impurities that might influence the sensing performance. Second, the size and density of AuNPs can be controlled by alternating the Au thickness in thermal evaporation procedure where it was found out that as the deposition thickness increased from 3 to 7 nm under 650 °C for 60 s RTA, the AuNPs size increased accordingly.\nAs depicted in Fig. 6 (A), with the RTA ramp temperature at 650 °C for 60 s, the highly nucleated AuNPs were observed (fig inset). Whereas, the photoluminescence characterization in Fig. 6(B) displays different structures from various treatments. The ZnO-NH with seeding temperature of 500 °C and its decoration with Au-spotted layer shows stronger intensity as being compared to other structures (without RTA). Fig. 6 (C, D, E) demonstrated the color changes generated by the LSPR effects on the fabricated substrate which indicates the absorption of the fraction of energy of incident light at a particular wavelength by the substrate [47–49].\nFig S3. illustrates the UV–vis absorption spectra of ZnO and Au-ZnO nanocomposites with respect to different Au-spotted over ZnO-NH and AuNPs effects due to RTA treatment over the surface. ZnO-NH shows no band at visible region as well as no plasmon nature. However, the spectra of nanocomposite at different thickness of Au-spotted sample clearly display an absorption in the visible region attributed to the localized surface plasmon band of Au nanoparticles over ZnO-NH at around 520 to 650 nm wavelength. The plasmon band is found to be broad indicating wide particle size distribution within the\nnanocomposites [50]. These AuNPs sizes can be seen with the measured statistical size distribution as well as histogram from the FE-SEM measurements, shown in Fig. 5.\nFig. 7 shows the visible emission characteristics of ZnO-NH grown at different seeding temperature of 400, 450 and 500 °C, respectively. Moreover, the study of related PL spectra in the presence and absence of AuNPs over defectless ZnO-NH carried out in the deposition of Au with different thickness of 3, 5, 7 nm via thermal evaporator was presented. PL measurements were performed at room temperature with an excitation wavelength of 405 nm laser. RTA is an adaptable technique to yield highly reproducible and uniform plasmonic surfaces in which the embedment of the NPs on the fundamental material might be induced [25,26,51]. After RTA, PL intensity seen in the fluorescence value at 570 nm of R6G dye and its corresponding linear range as calibration curve with respect to seeding temperature were strongly spiked due to the increment of seeding temperature during AuNPs spotted over ZnONH fabrication as shown in Fig. 7(A to I). As a matter of fact, according to the graph defect level centering at 670 nm, the higher seeding temperatures signified the enhancement in the photoluminescence spectra\nof the ZnO-NH. However, after loading of R6G dye over the plasmonic surface, the green emission fluorescence value of R6G (10−4 M) was detected along with the defect suppression at 670 nm owing to the AuNPs size and powerful surface plasmon oscillation triggered by the visible emission from Au-spotted ZnO-NH. Importantly, to point out the impact of the AuNPs size on the visible region enhancement, as seen in PL figure, the RTA of AuNPs spotted ZnO-NH at 500 °C exhibits the most significant enhancement in visible region because of fewer defects on ZnO surface than in others low temperature treatments surfaces. The thicker AuNPs represented by 7 nm thick Au film in this experiment only performed less enhancement in comparison with thinner Au deposition. This phenomenon might be occurring as result of inadequate embedment of partial AuNPs in ZnO-NH as well as distance separation effect between AuNPs and R6G dye. This concept is a suitable novel agreement towards sensing for R6G dye and possible enhanced linearity graph as calibration curve altogether with the potential smart surface plasmonic sensor. From the above PL results, we concluded that 650 °C for 60 s was the most optimum temperature for controlling AuNPs size with the different thickness of gold deposition over ZnO-NH and its tunable sensing behavior pertaining to seeding temperature of ZnO-NH. The structure of AuNPs spotted ZnO-NH without RTA in the visible emission suppressed to the noise level as the gold layer thickness gradually increased from 3 to 7 nm. Generally, the suppression of green emission is related to AuNPs and its interaction with the ZnO structure with AuNPs.\nTheoretically, the energy level of LSPR naturally enhances a strong electron transition to the higher level energy. The defect in the ZnO material is strongly correlated to the oxygen vacancy (VO) and resulting bandgap narrowing of the fabricated structure [17]. Thus, the VO forms a state level slightly above the valence band. The ZnO material with more VO contributes to the higher state level of VO above the valence band (Fig. 8 A and B). The defect level from the VO results in the effect of seeding temperature and RTA treatment during the fabrication process. The energy transition of AuNPs-over ZnO-NH with high- and lessdefect in ZnO crucially influences the number of electron excitation in LSPR energy level at AuNPs. The electron transition inside ZnO transition from the conduction band (CB) to the valence band (VB) is trapped by the VO and some electrons tunneling directly to the AuNPs. Due to the bandgap narrowing, the high VO results in less energy pumping to AuNPs; consequently, the electron excitation to the LSPR energy level is smaller as being compared to the defectless ZnO structure. Moreover, the number of electron excitation in LSPR energy state also influences the electron injection to R6G and enhance the fluorescence intensity. The more electron injection observed in LSPR energy state, the higher fluorescence enhanced signal of R6G was found (Fig.2). From the proposed model, gold nanoparticles and its size plays an important role in coupling interaction with R6G. Moreover, quenching and enhancing the fluorophore intensity are related to a space mechanism connecting the dipole of the donor and the gold NP as acceptor which are the most possible interactions with free electrons to follow Jablonski diagram model [52]. Furthermore, smaller size AuNPs are better and can accumulate a large number of molecules around the gold particles. Therefore, smaller particles become more proficient quenchers of molecular fluorescence than the larger ones. This would be ascribed to the strong self-assembly of AuNPs over ZnO-NH, which provided a strong plasmonic surface and strongly followed corresponding fluorescence energy transfer phenomena [53]. On the contrary, the number of electron in the LSPR energy state also induces the quenching or enhancement of electron injection to the CB of ZnO. With the absence of R6G, the PL measurement is contributed both by the energy transition of an electron to the VO (at ˜670 nm) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (at ˜570 nm) in ZnO and R6G, respectively (Fig. 7 A, D, G). Whilst, the R6G induced-fluorescence intensity (at ˜570 nm) has been proven by the measurement shown in Fig. 7 (B, E, H).

Besides, the ZnO bandgap fully depends on the oxygen vacancy that determines the defect energy level and bandgap narrowing.\nThe intensity of luminescence measurement from AuNPs spotted ZnO-NH with R6G at 570 nm of wavelength is plotted in Fig. 9. It indicates that at high seeding temperature, the ZnO-NH produced less defect on its surface and showed more effective enhancement equal to 6 times than those produced by larger and thicker AuNPs.\nFinally, for a comparative study to the LSPR based optoelectronic detection, the comparison of the previously published reports and our proposed study is listed in Table 1 showing that the proposed structure is greatly comparable to the previous reports with a significantly enhanced intensity, yet, with much simpler and cost-effective fabrication process."

    "abstractText" : "This study presents the defectless zinc oxide nano-hexagonrods (ZnO-NH) structure decorated by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and its enhancement due to the tunable plasmonic field for photoluminescence sensor. The ZnO-NHs were grown on ITO glass substrate via a low-cost hydrothermal method followed by annealing at different seeding temperatures, respectively. A correlation has been established between annealing temperature and the defect level concerning the diameter and density of ZnO-NH verified by Raman and FE-SEM images analysis. A further coating of the gold layer over ZnO-NH via thermal evaporator exhibits the plasmonic field enhancement in visible range which revives after short rapid annealing treatment. The enhancement is due to the large surface area of the sensing area on the haxagonrods shape and robust plasmonic coupling between metal and ZnO which efficiently detects fluorescence signal of Rhodamine 6G(R6G) molecules. A drastic change of tunable enhanced signal was resulted by AuNPs size and morphology and elucidated by suitable energy diagram observed from quenching to highly enhanced signal using photoluminescence spectrum and its related linearity plot. Carried out in three different thicknesses of AuNPs spotting on ZnO-NH, 3, 5 and 7 nm, it was observed that 3 nm AuNPs resulted in six times higher enhancement of output signal at seeding temperature of 500 than the 5 and 7 nm gold NPs spotted ZnO-NH at same experimental conditions. By the proposed structure, a significant photoluminescence and plasmonics enhancement, the ease of tunability, and higher uniformity were achieved by the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) from the AuNPs-decorated ZnO-NH and annealing process. Overall, the AuNPsZnO-NH hybrid offers a low-cost and simple fabrication potentially applied in a high-sensitive smart surface plasmonic optical sensor applications and can be a representative of new generations of photodiodes, solar cells, and metamaterials.",
