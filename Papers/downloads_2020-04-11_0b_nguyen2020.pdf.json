      "text" : "Titanium carbide (TiC) is among the most significant substances applicable in intense conditions owing to its high hardness, superb chemical resistance, high melting point, remarkable high-temperature stability, excellent corrosion resistance, and acceptable thermal conductivity [1–8]. According to the abovementioned combination of qualities, this material is considered as a major candidate in lots of areas, such as aerospace, cutting tools, nuclear reactors, etc. [9–14]. However, the flaw sensitivity and brittleness of TiC have restricted its use as a structural UHTC (ultra-high temperature ceramic), especially in the monolithic form [15–18]. Besides, sintering of TiC is challenging due to the presence of oxide layers on the surface of starting TiC particles inhibiting the consolidation, formation of intergranular pores\nbecause of the fast grain growth at elevated temperatures, slow mass transfer resulting in a low self-diffusion coefficient, and strong covalent bonding between Ti and C atoms [1,19–21].\nQuite a few researchers have tried to address these difficulties by adding various secondary phase particles and optimizing the sintering process circumstances. In terms of sintering aids/reinforcements, lots of studies have been accomplished on improving the physical and mechanical characteristics of TiC-based composites through some metallic (i.e., Me, Ti, Co, and Ni) and ceramic (i.e., ZrC, WC, SiC, AlN, TiN, and TiB2) additives [22–36]. Moreover, the implementation of newly developed sintering techniques, including spark plasma sintering (SPS) and hot isostatic pressing (HIP) instead of conventional powder metallurgy technique, can lead to the fabrication of samples with relatively higher qualifications [37–47]. The former, namely SPS, has been\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.diamond.2020.107828 Received 13 February 2020; Received in revised form 27 March 2020; Accepted 30 March 2020\n⁎ Correspondence to: T.P.

Silicon carbide has been the most frequently used additive studied by many scientists [48,63–68]. Chae et al. [66] improved the fracture toughness of as-sintered TiC by > 80% by adding 10 vol% SiC. Shahedi et al. [68] reported fully dense composite samples when 20–30 vol% SiC whiskers were introduced to TiC. It was also stated that SiC reinforcement had significant impacts on the thermal conductivity and hardness of asfabricated ceramics. Besides, Wang et al. [65] studied the role of SiC particle size on TiC qualifications. Application of nano-sized SiC reinforcement led to a relative density of 99%, whereas a relative density of around 95% was calculated for the sample doped with micro-sized SiC; moreover, the fracture toughness of the former specimen was ~17% higher than the latter. Titanium diboride (TiB2) composite as another highly investigated additive [6,69,70] was reportedly produced through the reactive sintering of the Ti-B4C-C system. A theoretical density of 100% was recorded through this method when initial powders were milled for around 6 h before the SPS process. Moreover, the microstructural investigation revealed the formation of two intermediate phases, namely Ti3B4 and TiB, along with in-situ TiB2 [6,69]. Various forms of carbon as the reinforcement in the TiC matrix were studied by some scientists [19,62,71]. Fattahi et al. [62] investigated the impact of nano-graphite addition on relative density, hardness, and flexural strength of TiC. Adding graphite improved relative density and flexural strength of monolithic TiC by around 2% and 25%, respectively, standing at 97.1% and 633 MPa. However, Vickers hardness of the doped sample dropped ~34% compared to monolithic TiC (2071 HV0.1kg for reinforced specimen). Song et al. [71] prepared TiCbased composites doped with 20 vol% carbon fiber by hot pressing method. The best relative density of 98.4% was secured at a sintering temperature of 2200 °C, whereas optimal fracture toughness (~7 MPa·m1/2) and flexural strength (~600 MPa) were obtained at 2100 °C. Fiber bridging, fiber pullout, fiber rupture, and crack deflections were chief mechanisms of toughening and strengthening in the doped ceramics. Finally, the formation of in-situ graphene nanoribbon was detected when 2 wt% carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) were introduced to TiC-3.5 wt% WC. This phenomenon boosted the fracture toughness of the sample by ~118% [19].\nAlthough some brilliant researches have been accomplished on monolithic TiC and other TiC-based composites, there is no available work on the impacts of nano-diamond as an additive on the physicalmechanical properties and microstructure of TiC materials. In the present paper, therefore, 5 wt% nano-diamond was introduced to TiC, and the results were compared to the undoped sample. Both ceramics were sintered at the same conditions by the SPS process at 1900 °C under an external pressure of 40 MPa for 10 min."

      "text" : "The relevant information of TiC and diamond as starting powders are provided in Table 1. Also, the results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of these materials are illustrated in Fig. 1. According to these patterns, it can be concluded that the initial powders were free of undesirable phases, or the amount of these unwanted phases were below the accuracy of the XRD device. In this research, two various specimens (monolithic TiC and TiC-5 wt% nano-diamond) were fabricated to evaluate the impacts of diamond reinforcement on the characteristics of TiC. For the preparation of noted ceramics, starting materials were first weighed based on the compositions of each sample. Then, the weighed powders were wet-mixed in the medium of ethanol by a magnetic mixer for 120 min. To remove the liquid phase, the wet mixtures were heated\nin an oven at 80 °C for around 2 h. Then, homogenous mixtures were obtained with crushing the dried slurries and passing them through a sieve. A graphite mold with 3 cm in diameter was selected for the fabrication of specimens. Powder mixtures were loaded into the mold after being lined by a graphite foil (0.5 mm in thickness) to minimize chemical interactions between the powder and the die. Afterward, the sintering process was accomplished using an SPS machine (Nanozint 10i, Khala Poushan Felez Co., Iran) in the following steps. After reducing the pressure of the SPS chamber to < 2 Pa, the samples were heated to 600 °C under an external pressure of 20 MPa for 15 min. Next, the sintering temperature was gradually raised to 1900 °C at 65 °C/min rate. Meanwhile, the external pressure was also increased to 40 MPa. Both samples were held in this ultimate temperature/pressure for 10 min, and then, the apparatus was shut down. The characteristics of the SPS device are also presented in Table 2. After cooling the samples in the chamber, as-fabricated ceramics were withdrawn from the mold.\nThe relative densities of as-sintered specimens were measured by calculating the ratio of bulk densities to theoretical densities. These densities were also estimated through Archimedes and the rule of mixtures methods, respectively. The determination of available crystalline phases in raw materials and as-produced ceramics were accomplished by an XRD machine (PW3710, Philips). The microstructural evaluations on polished and fracture surfaces of sintered samples were carried out using FESEM (Tescan) armed by an EDS analyzer. The hardness of specimens was measured using a Vickers hardness tester (ZHV10, Zwick Roell). For evaluating the flexural strength, the threepoint bending technique was executed on the standard samples (28 mm × 4 mm × 3 mm) by a universal testing machine (STM-250). Finally, a conductivity meter (Sahand Co., Iran) was used to estimate the thermal conductivity of ceramics at room temperature."

      "text" : "According to a study accomplished by Babapoor et al. [72], a sintering temperature of 1900 °C was selected as the ideal temperature for sintering the TiC based ceramics by the SPS technique. The relative density of as-fabricated samples is exhibited in Fig. 2. Diamond reinforcement, as is apparent, harmed the consolidation behavior of TiC. The relative density calculated for the undoped specimen was 95.5% while introducing nano-diamond to this material dropped this value to 90.3%. As reported by song et al. [73], attaining relative densities close to 100% is difficult at the sintering conditions, similar to the present research without using an appropriate sintering aid. Nevertheless, relative density values of 98.2% (hot press process at 2100 °C), 98% (SPS process at 1600 °C), and 99% (SPS process at 1900 °C) were reported for the monolithic TiC specimens [34,72,73]. Higher relative density values recorded in the abovementioned studies by the SPS technique could be owing to used finer TiC particles. On the other hand, a few scientists have studied the influences of various carbonaceous phases, including carbon fiber (Cf), nano-graphite, and CNTs on the densification behavior of TiC-based composites. Song et al. [73] introduced 20 vol% Cf to TiC, and a relative density of 98.4% was secured by hot pressing of samples at 2200 °C. Moreover, Fattahi et al. [62] reported\nthat the addition of 5 wt% nano-graphite led to improvement by ~1.5% in the relative density of undoped TiC, standing at ~97%. The constructive roles of these kinds of carbon in enhancing the sintering behavior are against the result obtained for nano-diamond in this work. This phenomenon is owing to the fundamental difference of diamond with other carbonaceous phases, which is explained later.\nThe relevant XRD pattern of monolithic TiC is presented in Fig. 3a. As can be seen, the sintering process has led to the generation of nonstoichiometric TiCx and two carbonaceous phases (with cubic and rhombohedral crystalline structures), which were not present in the initial TiC powder (Fig. 1). It is stated in the literature that the electrical and mechanical characteristics of TiCx are highly dependent on the value of x, which can vary between ~0.5–1 [74]. In other words, TiCx can possess various consolidation behaviors, hardness, bulk modulus, morphology, and grain size with alternating the C/Ti ratio [68]. Stochiometric TiC has a NaCl-type (B1) crystalline structure in which Ti atoms occupy face-centered positions, and C atoms deploy at octahedral spots. On the other side, non-stoichiometric TiCx can be considered as a disordered phase where some of the carbon sites are vacant [70]. Consequently, it seems that the SPS circumstances have forced some carbon atoms to leave their locations in the TiC structure and\nprecipitate at the grain boundaries as free carbon. Besides, it is well known that powder materials containing a high level of Ti are covered by titanium dioxide (TiO2). Oxide layers, such as TiO2, are believed as destructive phases that prohibit a proper consolidation stage. In fact,\none of the main reasons why sintering aids lead to improving sintering behavior is their role in removing these layers present on powder particles. In short, TiO2 acts as an obstacle between two adjacent TiC particles for providing a strong bond. However, carbon precipitation at the grain boundaries of TiC can serve as only a sintering aid in eradicating TiO2 layers, which can happen through the chemical reaction presented in Eq. (1) [1]. According to this interaction, carbon reduces TiO2 layers to in-situ formed TiC and a gaseous phase, namely CO.\n+ = +TiO 3C TiC 2CO (g)2 (1)\nFig. 3b indicates the relevant XRD pattern of diamond-doped TiC composite. The detected phases were roughly the same as those detected for the monolithic sample. As is apparent in the pattern, however, no cubic form of carbon was detected in the doped sample, suggesting the decomposition of diamond over the SPS process. Diamond can be considered as a metastable form of carbon. However, it is stable only owing to a kinetic problem in restoring its structural lattice. At higher temperatures, this problem decreased considerably [75]. Shao et al. [76] reported that graphitization of diamond could take place at two temperature ranges of < 1627 °C, E = 200 KJ/mol, and > 1627 °C, E = 1300 KJ/mol. Besides, Oliveira et al. [75] stated that diamond graphitization occurred on the surface at ~700–1400 °C in vacuum conditions. An intense layer of the diamond will graphitize with increasing temperature to higher than ~1800 °C.\nIn the terms of Nano-diamonds (NDs), many factors can affect the graphitization of them, including diamond size (nanometer, micron, grit), diamond type (man-made, natural), pressure, temperature, and specimen environment (inert gas, oxygen or high vacuum). In fact, all these factors should be carefully controlled to obtain reliable data on the graphitization process. Depending the surface condition of NDs, graphitization may start at 670–899 °C under atmospheric pressure.\nHowever, this phenomenon can happen at a lower temperature in the SPS technique owing to sub-atmospheric pressures. By contrast, the availability of trace content of oxygen may speed up the graphitization kinetics of NDs' detonation; however, such an occurrence is less probable in the SPS technique compared to hot-pressing or pressureless sintering process, due to the implementation of SPS in a very low atmospheric pressure [77–80].\nExternal pressure is one of the main variables, which affects phase transformation from diamond to graphite over the synthesize, due to the higher specific volume of graphite compared to diamond (1.55 times). It was reported in the literature that NDS may preserve its initial form until the temperature of 950 °C under an external pressure of 60 MPa. With increasing the temperature, the surface of NDs starts to graphitize, and some amorphous carbon appears on the particles. Lamellar graphite phases are created at 1300 °C and stabilized with arising dwelling time. Consequently, the sintering conditions in the pressureless process are more advantageous for the graphitization of NDs. The availability of external pressure over the SPS technique may enhance the thermal stability of NDs, postponing the starting temperature of graphitization. As a result, an appropriate pressure during the SPS process can lead to a postponement in the transitional temperature of NDs' graphitization and the stability of NDs [81–84].\nHence, the rate of graphitization can be calculated by measuring the amount of graphite produced in a certain time and on a certain surface [76]. On the other hand, Bundy et al. [85] have suggested that the rate of the diamond to graphite reaction depends on various factors, including activation energy of the transformation with involving a possible intermediate state, nucleation of the new phase, and incidence rate of energy pulses involved in the transformation from initial phase through the intermediate to the ultimate phase. This can rationalize why the diamond can be stable at ambient circumstances indefinitely. In other words, the rate of this transformation is zero at room temperature and pressure, which can be measured through the formula shown in Eq. (2) [85]:\n=Rate C·(kT/h)·exp ( Q/RT)·[1–exp ( F/RT)] (2)\nwhere C is a constant, kT/h presents the number of energy pulses for 1 mol in 1 s, exp(−Q/RT) is the proportion of energy pulses above the demanded activation energy, and [1 – exp. (ΔF/RT)] term represents the possibility of the substance remaining in the final state concerning the difference of free energy between the starting and last states. For carbon, this activation energy can be assumed around 175,000 Cal/mol [85]. Besides, the presence of small oxygen amount in the ambient environment, or availability of oxide phases can facilitate the graphitization of diamond. In these circumstances, small pits can form on the surface of diamond owing to chemical interactions between diamond particles with oxides or oxygen, which can result in the production of two gaseous phases of CO or CO2. On the other hand, the formation of mentioned tiny pits leads to an increment in the specific surface of diamond powder, leading to a higher rate of graphitization [76].\nBased on the discussion, considering the size of nano-diamond powder, there is a high possibility that all the initial diamond particles have been graphitized during the sintering process. This assumption is entirely in harmony with the XRD result for TiC-5 wt% nano-diamond (Fig. 3b). The lower relative density of the doped sample than monolithic TiC can be owing to the energy required for graphitizing diamond particles, which hinders a complete consolidation stage. Besides, the chemical interactions between diamond particles and available oxygen derived from the ambient environment or TiO2 layers lead to the production of more gaseous phases that can remain as porosity in the microstructure."

      "heading" : "3.2. Microstructural evaluation",
      "text" : "The FESEM micrograph of the polished surface of monolithic TiC is shown in Fig. 4a, where the presence of some porosity confirms the\nresults obtained for the relative density. A high magnification micrograph of this specimen is also exhibited in Fig. 5. The black-colored phase, indicated by the white arrow, is associated with carbon-rich areas, which have departed from the TiC lattice and precipitated at the grain boundaries. Moreover, the relevant EDS analysis of points A, B and C shown in Table 3 suggested the possibility of production of nonstoichiometric TiC, especially at the zones close to the TiC grain boundaries. According to this information, the TiC phase in point B has lower carbon content than TiC in point A, indicating the formation of\nvacant carbon spots in the TiC lattice. Moreover, point C indicates the precipitated carbon in the microstructure of the monolithic ceramic.\nThe microstructure of the diamond-doped sample contains a brightgray-colored matrix (TiC/TiCx), in which some dark-gray-colored carbon-rich areas are dispersed in the matrix (Fig. 4b). These zones correspond to the carbon precipitated along with graphitized nanodiamond particles. These phases are indicated in Fig. 6a as well. The relevant EDS map analysis of Ti and C elements (Fig. 6b and c) endorse the formation of non-stoichiometric TiC all over the sample surface. For having a better perspective of the morphology of carbonaceous phases in the TiC-5 wt% diamond, two high magnification micrographs captured from the polished surface are presented in Fig. 7. The flaky shape of these carbonaceous phases is in agreement with the discussion on the transformation of the nano-diamond particles to graphite. Besides, the availability of remained pores is apparent in these FESEM images. As mentioned before, the sintering conditions were not appropriate to eliminate the porosity in both specimens; however, the addition of nano-diamond as an additive led to worsened consolidation behavior of TiC.\nThe fractographs of undoped TiC (Fig. 8a) illustrate both intergranular and intragranular pores. The intergranular pores are related to an incomplete sintering process, and the intragranular ones are associated with grain growth. In other words, when two adjacent TiC particles coalesce, some pores can be trapped into the new large grain. In the absence of a suitable sintering aid, this porosity remained in the microstructures as the intragranular pores. In the term of fracture mode, although both intergranular and transgranular modes can be observed in the fracture surface, the former is the predominant mode in the monolithic ceramic. On the other side, introducing nano-diamond particles hindered the excessive grain growth of TiC grains (Fig. 8b). As can be seen, the grain size of the doped sample is similar to that of the initial TiC powder, namely < 20 μm. As a consequence, no intragranular pores can be seen in this FESEM image. Also, a much less transgranular fracture is present in the doped sample, possibly due to weaker bonds between the particles that the monolithic ceramic. The morphology of graphitized carbon (Fig. 9) reveals the presence of some flaky phases at the grain boundaries, which belong to the precipitated or graphitized carbon."

      "heading" : "3.3. Mechanical characteristics",
      "text" : "Vickers hardness values of monolithic TiC and diamond-doped ceramics are illustrated in Fig. 10. The undoped-TiC reached a hardness of ~3130 HV0.1 kg, while introducing 5 wt% nano-diamond decreased this quality by ~8%, standing at 2872 HV0.1 kg. It has been reported in the literature that the hardness of a ceramic-based composite highly relies on several aspects, such as relative density, grain size, and even\nthe composition of material [86–92]. In terms of relative density, the monolithic specimen had less porosity than the doped one, as is shown in Fig. 1. On the other hand, the addition of nano-diamond as an additive played a role as a grain growth inhibitor, as the doped composite possessed a finer microstructure than the undoped sample. Finally, although diamond is a harder phase than the TiC matrix, the sintering process resulted in the graphitization of this secondary phase. Consequently, the final composite held a soft secondary phase dispersed into the TiC matrix. Altogether, it seems that the relative density and composition have played dominant roles in securing such results for the hardness of the ceramics [93–98].\nThe results for the flexural strength of TiC and nano-diamond-doped\nsamples were also in harmony with those obtained for the relative density and Vickers hardness (Fig. 11). In brief, the monolithic TiC reached a flexural strength of slightly higher than 500 MPa, whereas this value dropped by ~26% by adding the reinforcement. As noted in the previous sections, the nano-diamond not only decreased the relative density of TiC but also hindered a strong bonding between the available particles. Accordingly, the lower flexural strength of the doped sample than monolithic TiC supports other results obtained in this study. The authors also investigated the impact of nano-graphite on the flexural strength of TiC in another research [62]. Surprisingly, nano-graphite had a different influence on this quality, so that it improved the flexural strength of TiC by around 25%. The reason for this phenomenon can be\nthe energy required for graphitizing diamonds during the SPS process. On the contrary, the available heat can participate in progressing the chemical reaction of eliminating TiO2 oxide layers, and consequently improving the sinterability of TiC-5 wt% nano-graphite."

      "heading" : "3.4. Thermal conductivity",
      "text" : "On the other hand, nano-diamond addition had a noticeable effect\non the thermal conductivity of TiC (Fig. 12). The TiC-5 wt% nanodiamond (23.3 W/m.K) exhibited a thermal conductivity of ~32%, higher than the monolithic TiC. This characteristic in ceramics is highly controlled by point defects, secondary phases, grain boundaries, grain size, etc. [72]. In fact, the presence of a secondary phase should logically lead to a drop in the thermal conductivity of the material owing to providing extra grain boundaries [99,100]. In this study, the doped sample contained more porosity, which negatively affects this quality. Consequently, it seems that graphitized diamond particles have formed a continuous network at the grain boundaries, and their much higher thermal conductivity [101] than the TiC matrix could uplift the thermal conductivity of the composite to such a level."

For this purpose, 5 wt% nano-diamond was introduced to TiC-based ceramics sintered at 1900 °C under an external pressure of 40 MPa for 10 min. Assintered samples were characterized by assessing relative density, hardness, thermal conductivity, flexural strength, and performing microstructural and phase analyses using FESEM and XRD. The results confirmed the formation of non-stoichiometric TiCx in both specimens and graphitization of nano-diamond particles in the doped specimen. Introducing nano-diamond to TiC matrix decreased the mechanical properties, but significantly improved the thermal conductivity.",
