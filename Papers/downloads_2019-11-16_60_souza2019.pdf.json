Several methods of surface modification are chronologically described bridging ordinary methods (e.g.\ngrit blasting and etching) and advanced physicochemical approaches such as 3D-laser texturing and biomimetic modification. Functionalization procedures by using proteins, peptides, and bioactive ceramics have provided an enhancement in wettability and bioactivity of implant surfaces. Furthermore, recent findings have revealed a combined beneficial effect of micro- and nano-scale modification and biomimetic functionalization of titanium surfaces. However, some technological developments of implant surfaces are not commercially available yet due to costs and a lack of clinical validation for such recent surfaces. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to endorse the use of enhanced biomimetic implant surfaces.\nStatement of Significance\nGrit-blasting followed by acid-etching is currently used for titanium implant modifications, although recent technological biomimetic physicochemical methods have revealed enhanced osteoconductive and anti-microbial outcomes. An improvement in wettability and bioactivity of titanium implant surfaces has been accomplished by combining micro and nano-scale modification and functionalization with protein, peptides, and bioactive compounds. Such morphological and chemical modification of the titanium surfaces induce the migration and differentiation of osteogenic cells followed by an enhancement of the mineral matrix formation that accelerate the osseointegration process. Additionally, the incorporation of bioactive molecules into the nanostructured surfaces is a promising strategy to avoid early and late implant failures induced by the biofilm accumulation.\n2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

Introduction\nOral rehabilitation involving dental implants in partially and fully edentulous patients has been well reported in literature. Dental and orthopedic implants has been significantly enhanced since the first studies reported by Branemark [1–5]. Recently, the development of different design and surfaces of titanium implants has been the major focus for many companies and research projects [3]. Since the 70’s, dental implant systems have changed from hexagonal to conical connections, cylindrical to conical design, and machined to rough titanium surfaces. Also, alternative materials revealing high biological and mechanical performance such as zirconia has been introduced in implant dentistry [6–9]. However, titanium is still the first choice to manufacturing endosseous implants considering a broad versatility of surface morphologic aspects, design, and connections [3,4,10].\nCommercially pure titanium (cp Ti) and Ti alloys are remarkably utilized in the field of implant dentistry and orthopedics due to their high corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, osseointegration, and strength [11–14]. The clinical long-term success rate of titanium-based dental implants is recorded at 87.8% over a follow-up period of 36-year [4]. The osseointegration process of the implant surface itself and the long-term stability of the implant-bone interface are the foundation for such clinical success rate [2,4,5,15–18]. Understanding the relationship among morphological aspects of the titanium surface, biocompatibility, and osseointegration is a key factor for clinicians and manufacturers [18–21]. The micro- and nano-scale features and chemical composition of the implant surfaces determine the early bone formation around implants [10,14,19,20,22–24]. Most of commercially titanium-based implant surfaces with moderately rough surfaces are manufactured by mixed techniques such as grit-blasting followed by acid-etching [23,25–27]. Furthermore, latest studies have been focused on the combined micro- and nano-scale surface modification by using innovative techniques [18,28–33]. Surface nanoscale features can increase the adsorption of proteins and stimulate the osteogenic cell migration leading to the osseointegration speeding up [14,18,19,31,34–37].\nThe main aim of this review study was to report the state of art on the nano-technological advancements of titanium implant surfaces to enhance the osseointegration process. This review article deals with the titanium properties, innovative physicochemical procedures to modify titanium surfaces, biomimetic functionalization, and inhibition of biofilm accumulation. It was hypothesized that the nano-scale modification of titanium surfaces enhances the adsorption of protein, osteogenic cell migration, angiogenesis, and early bone formation onto the implants.\n2. Methods\nA bibliographical search was carried out on MEDLINE/PubMed (via National Library of Medicine) using the following search terms: ‘‘titanium dental implants” AND ‘‘surface modification” OR ‘‘nano-scale modification” OR ‘‘nanotechnology” OR ‘‘surface treatment” AND ‘‘wettability” OR ‘‘roughness” OR ‘‘bone healing” OR ‘‘bone-implant interface” OR ‘‘BIC” OR ‘‘osseointegration” OR ‘‘bone formation”. Also, a manual search was performed considering the\nreferences within the selected articles. The inclusion criteria involved English language articles published up to December 2018, reporting different techniques used for titanium implant surface modification at micro- and nano-scale to enhancing the adsorption of proteins, osteogenic cell migration, angiogenesis, and bone matrix formation. On the title and abstract, the evaluation of the potentially relevant articles was accomplished independently by three of the authors (JCMS, MBS, MK). Selected articles were individually read and analyzed considering the purpose of this study. The retrieved variables considered for this review were: authors’ names; journal; publication year; surface features; study design; surface modification techniques; implant roughness; bone-implant contact area (BIC); wettability.\n3. Results and discussion\nThe literature search identified a total of 1416 articles within the PubMed database, as shown in Fig. 1. After accomplishing the reading of the titles and abstracts of the articles, 1073 were excluded once they did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining 343 potentially relevant studies were then evaluated (Fig. 1). Of these studies, 74 were excluded because they did not provide comprehensive data on titanium implant surface modification at micro- and nano-scale to enhancing the adsorption of proteins, osteogenic cell migration, angiogenesis, and bone matrix formation. Thus, 252 relevant studies were included in this integrative review. The manual search included 13 articles related to the state of art of dental implants.\nOf the 252 studies selected, 23% were selected on the evaluation of ordinary techniques for titanium surface modification including the combined grit-blasting and etching procedures. Data on the grit-blasting and etching procedures associated with resultant titanium roughness and wettability, are shown in Table 1. The gritblasting procedure increase the titanium roughness at microscale while the etching procedure can modify the roughness at nano-scale. The combination of the procedures results in a nanostructured surface which is commercially available in implant\n114 J.C.M. Souza et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 94 (2019) 112–131\ndentistry. Considering the morphological aspects, wettability, and roughness are well-described in literature, the grit-blasting followed by etching is used by different manufacturers of titanium implants and to manufacture standard surfaces (control groups) for scientific comparison with the development of novel modification techniques [38–55]. The effect of the nano-scale modification of titanium surfaces via formation of nanotubes on titanium surfaces was described in 17% of the selected articles. The formation of nanotubes has been accomplished by electrochemical methods at different parameters of voltage, time, and immersion solution, as seen in Table 2 [32,56–66]. That determined the chemical composition, properties, and dimensions (diameter and length) of the nanotubes. Also, some previous studies produced nanotubes to adsorb bioactive molecules to enhance the osseointegration process or to inhibit bacteria adhesion [67–72]. The modification of titanium implant surfaces by using nanotechnology was stated in 10% selected articles considering the enhancement of the osseointegration process.\nThe biomimetic functionalization of titanium implant surfaces was reported in 16% of the selected articles. The biomimetic functionalization of titanium surfaces has been experimentally assessed by in vitro studies to accelerate the osteogenic cell migration and differentiation [73–84]. Different bioactive molecules and compounds composed of biopolymers or ceramics have been assessed to mimic the bone healing process. Such results are promising for the development of dental implant surfaces.\nData on the physicochemical characterization methods to evaluate the bone-implant interface percentage and wettability were provided by 18 and 25% articles, respectively; however, the chemical reactivity of titanium was discussed by 19% and therefore the\nbone healing process was stated by 27% of the selected articles. The bone-implant contact (BIC) percentage for 8 weeks bone healing ranged from 30 up to approximately 85% [85–87]. The lowest mean values for both BIC percentage and wettability were recorded for machined titanium surfaces while the nanostructured surfaces revealed the highest values [32,42,58,60,62,88–90]. BIC percentage varied considering the animal study design, surface features, and healing time although there was an increase in BIC when the surface was modified at nano-scale. At last, anti-bacterial or antibiofilm approaches was reported in 18% of the relevant studies. Titanium surfaces have been modified with antibiofilm compounds to inhibit the accumulation of pathogenic species related to the peri-implant inflammatory reactions.\n3.1. Titanium surfaces and their physicochemical modification\nAmong various types of titanium-based materials, commercially pure titanium (cp Ti) grade IV or titanium-zirconium (e.g., Ti15Zr) alloys is commonly used to manufacture metallic dental implant fixtures, while abutments are produced from titaniumaluminum-vanadium (Ti6Al4V) alloys. Thus, the selection of titanium and its alloys is determined by biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, strength, and osseointegration outcomes [5,6,91–93]. Cp Ti grade IV has a high purity degree (98.9% Ti) associated to a tensile strength at around 560 MPa while Ti6Al4V has approximately 89% Ti and a high tensile strength at approximately 940 MPa to tolerate the stress magnitude from occlusal loading [3,93]. Cp Ti and Ti-based alloys are reported in the literature as materials with a high corrosion resistance in simulated body solutions and a high biocompatibility in such cases of applications\nJ.C.M .Souza et al./A cta Biom aterialia 94 (2019) 112– 131 115\n116 J.C.M .Souza et al./A cta Biom aterialia 94 (2019) 112– 131\n– For anodization + thermal oxidation (Ad + TO), samples were subjected to anodization of 60 V for 2 h in 4.0 vol % DI-water, 0.2 wt% NH4F, and ethylene glycol electrolyte, followed by the thermal oxidation protocol of 600 C for 3 h\nAd + TO group: – Day 0: 7 ± 1 – Day 1: 18 ± 2 – Day 14: 35 ± 4 – Day 25: 43 ± 1\nJothi Prakash et al.

Souza et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 94 (2019) 112–131\n[14,93–95]. Nevertheless, the biocompatibility of Ti-based materials depends on the material properties, patient health conditions, and the anatomical site where the material is placed [96]. Also, physical properties of cpTi and Ti alloys such as low density at 4.5 g/cm3 combined with a low thermal conductivity are clinically valuable concerning the chewing movement and temperature oscillation in the oral cavity.\nAfter finishing and polishing the titanium surface, a ultra-thin Ti oxide layer (thickness ranging from 1 to 20 nm) commonly composed of titanium dioxide (TiO2) is formed over a short time of around 30 ms on the titanium surfaces [14,97]. Additionally, TiO, TiO(OH) or Ti2O3 can also be detected in the chemical composition of the Ti oxide layer upon contact with deionized water although Ti2O3 is promptly converted to TiO(OH)2 and then to TiO2, after reaction with H2O molecules [98]. The titanium oxide layer is also known as a passive film considering the stable oxide structure that results in a high corrosion resistance in contact with body fluids [11,93,94]. Calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) are incorporated into the oxide layer when the titanium implant is in contact with the blood of the surgical site that speed up the osseointegration process [14]. Blood molecules and cells such as platelets and osteoblasts physicochemically interact with the titanium oxide layer. The chemical composition and the morphological aspects of the Ti-based surface stimulate the activation of blood platelets, fibrin cross-linking, and migration of osteogenic cells [19,26,99]. As a result, a direct structural and mechanical interlocking of the implant surface to the bone tissue takes place without the existence of a fibrous connective tissue, that is known as osseointegration process [1,5,19,26,37,99]. The first phase of the osseointegration process is named osteoconduction, which consists in the recruitment and migration of osteogenic cells to the implant surface as an effect of the blood platelets activation and the presence of growth factors such as PDGF, PGE2, and TGF-b [19,99]. The second phase comprises the ‘‘new bone” formation by the interface matrix mineralization, similar to the formation of the cement layer of the bone tissue. The slow process of bone remodeling is the last phase of the osseointegration process [19].\nNevertheless, acidic and reactive substances in the surrounding media can disrupt the Ti oxide film [94,100]. The TiO2 layer can be\nmodified in the presence of H+ found in acidic medium leading to the formation of Ti(OH)3+. Previous studies revealed the degradation of the Ti oxide film in media containing reactive substances such as fluorides, lactic acid, or hydrogenperoxide [12,91,92,94,101]. In fact, the corrosive process of titanium-based structures depends on the exposure to high concentration, low pH, and contacting time of the corrosive substances [91–94]. On the other hand, dental implants’ manufacturers utilize a combination of acidic substances such as HF, HNO3, HCl, and H2SO4 (etching procedure) to increase the titanium implant roughness and surface area for osseointegration.\nMacro-design of implants can be drawn by machining the titanium surfaces to generate features and threads in the range of millimeters that are responsible for the primary stability achievement. Thus, the primary implant anchorage after placement and longterm mechanical stability is determined by the macro-design of the titanium implant, bone type, surgical site, and implant surgery technique [2,3,45,102]. Physicochemical methods have been developed to promote a chemical and morphological modification of titanium surfaces to increase the adsorption of blood proteins, ions, and molecules, and to stimulate blood platelet activation and osteogenic cell migration [10,103–107]. Several manufacturers utilize combinations of physical and chemical procedures to achieve the required osseointegration process [14,53,54,108–110]. Previous studies revealed an activation of blood platelet cells in contact with titanium surfaces leading to the cross-linking of the fibrin clot which can be entrapped into the irregularities of rough surfaces [19,99]. The three-dimensional fibrin clot stimulate the migration and adhesion of osteogenic cells to the bone-implant region [19].\nRoughness, wettability, and chemical composition play a critical role in the implant–bone interaction and bone healing [10,32,86,111]. Different roughness and morphological patterns of titanium implant surfaces are shown in Fig. 2. Beside with roughness, wettability (recorded by water contact angle measurements) influences the adsorption of molecules from the physiological environment [74,112–114,115] and then cell receptors will bind to functional groups of the adsorbed proteins [116–118]. Titanium implants with high surface energy and low water contact angle values reveal a high blood wettability and affinity for protein adsorption that enhance the osseointegration process [119].\nJ.C.M. Souza et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 94 (2019) 112–131 119\nIn the last years, the osseointegration time has been the focus of the technological advancements in implant dentistry. Regarding the average bone healing time of approximately 3 months in the mandible and 6 months in the maxilla [85,120,121], nanostructured implant surfaces have been studied to shorten the time for osseointegration [21,24,39,44]. The modification of the implant surface structure at a micro- and nano-scale have shown an enhancement of the titanium integration to the bone tissue [18,122,123]. Nowadays, implant surfaces can be improved by mimicking the morphological aspects and structure of natural tissues, with dimensions ranging from 1 up to 100 nm, that comprises the nano-scale [124]. Furthermore, understanding the beneficial aspects of nanostructured surfaces has attracted the attention of scientists and clinicians on alternative techniques to promote the nano-scale modification of implant surfaces [39,122,125,126].\n3.2. Modification of surface by grit-blasting and acid-etching procedures\nAfter the machining of titanium structural materials into the desirable implant design, implant surfaces are often submitted to grit-blasting with abrasive particles (110–250 lm in size) such as aluminum oxide (Al2O3), silicon oxide (SiO2) or titanium oxide (TiO2) [40,41]. The roughness of the implant surface varies depending on the physical and chemical procedures for titaniummodification, as seen in Table 1 [50,55,110,127–129]. Surfaces modified by combining grit-blasting and acid-etching are known as sandblasted, large-grit, and acid-etched surfaces and therefore the term SLA is commercially used. Several acidic substances can be used by dental implant manufacturers as follow: hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrofluoric acid (HF), nitric acid (HNO3), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). A variety of guidelines for combination and concentration of acid solutions (e.g., HCl/H2SO4 or HF/HNO3), as well as temperature and etching time are reported for this procedure, as shown in Table 1 [42,43,50,54,55,130,131]. For instance, a well-known procedure for acid-etching of titanium surfaces comprises the immersion of implants in HCl/H2SO4 under ultrasonic vibration at 60 or 100 C for 60 min. The acid-etching can remove entrapped abrasive particles on the air-braided titanium surfaces followed by the dissolution of the titanium oxide film and micro-scale bulk layer in the titanium subsurface (Fig. 2). That results in the formation of micro-scale pits and spike-like peaks resulting in an average roughness (Ra) ranging from 1 up to 2.7 lm (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Roughness mean values depend on the grit-blasting and acidetching procedure [27,45,50,132–134].\nA vast number of studies demonstrated that air-braided and etched surface provides beneficial effects on the biocompatibility, enhanced cell differentiation, and apposition of newly bone [46,135–137] with a clinical success rate of around 95% [10,14,54,55,132,138]. The morphological aspect of the titanium surfaces modified by grit-blasting and acid-etching plays a key role on the activation of blood platelets and on the migration of osteogenic cells to the bone-implant interface [19,99,139,140,252]. The mechanical interlocking between titanium surface and bone tissue as a result of the morphological aspects of titanium surfaces provides the long-term mechanical stability of the bone-implant interface.\nIncreasing attention has been given to the hydrophilicity of implant surfaces for further shortening the osseointegration period in the cases of early loaded implants at compromised sites with low bone density [54,86,87,141–143]. A supplementary chemically modification of air-braided and acid-etched surfaces undergoes a continuous immersion of the titanium implant in isotonic solution at low pH that results in a super-hydrophilic titanium surface. Such procedure can be commercially found as a brand named SLActive. The combination of acid-etching and conditioning in isotonic aque-\nous solution maintains a chemical stability of the titanium surface and therefore the surface becomes super-hydrophilic due to the chemical and nano-scale modification. Spike-like nanofeatures were detected on ultra-hydrophilic titanium surfaces modified by acid-etching in combination with a conditioning in isotonic solutions [27,46,142]. An increase in the bond strength of implant to bone tissue was recorded for the super-hydrophilic nanostructured surfaces by using mechanical pulling out tests after 8 weeks of bone healing in rabbit tibia [142]. Such nanostructured surfaces can enhance protein adsorption, platelet aggregation at the surgical site, and monocyte/macrophage adhesion [37,46] that enhance the initial healing process and bone apposition during the early phases of osseointegration [54,128,142,144–146]. Previous studies have reported an up-regulation of pro-osteogenic cell signaling pathways including TGF-b/BMP, PGE2, Wnt and Notch and increased differentiation markers such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and osteocalcin on ultrahydrophilic titanium surfaces [46,147]. Those findings indicated that ultra-hydrophilic titanium surfaces have high osteoconductive potential and can increase the bone-implant contact (BIC) percentage within 2–4 weeks when compared to ordinary air-braided and acid-etched surfaces [9,131,148–155]. The mean BIC percentage for SLA surfaces have been recorded in the range of 67–81% over a period of 6 months bone healing.\nA prospective 10-year cohort study based on a randomized controlled trial (RCT) focusing on marginal bone loss for implants with ordinary air-braided and acid-etched surfaces stated 95.1% clinical success rate with mean bone loss of 1.07 mm [156]. A recent RCT study of immediate provisional restorations on implants confirmed a clinical success rate at 100% and positive aesthetic outcomes with ultra-hydrophilic surfaces [132,157,158]. Combined micro- and nano-scale modification of titanium implants has shown beneficial conditions for the osteogenic cell growth, since it provides a random dimensional structure by mimicking the hierarchical structure of bone tissue [27,39,159–161].\n3.3. Electrochemical modification: formation of nanotubes\nCurrent studies increasingly deal with the manufacturing of titanium-based nanopores/nanotubes on titanium implant surfaces [57,71,118,162–164]. Anodization is an ordinary electrochemical technique for titanium oxide modification that can result in a porous and chemically modified surface [165,166]. The diameter and length of titanium oxide nanotubes are defined by changing anodization variables such as electrical current power, anodization time, temperature, applied potential, and electrolyte chemical composition [64,167].\nAnodized surfaces at nano-scale are promising for biomedical applications due to the capability of loading and delivering of bioactive molecules and growth factors to enhance the osseointegration process [57,58,64,71,118,162,165,166,168]. Titanium modification by producing nanotubes increases the contact surface area leading to the increase in wettability and adsorption of proteins, ions, and blood cells [32,57,58,118,169,170].\nThe localized incorporation of antimicrobial substances into the nanotubes is strategically beneficial to decrease the content of bacteria surrounding the implant and to avoid risks of early failures induced by pathogenic bacteria [61,69,71,88,171].\nThe anodization process of titanium surfaces results in vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays with a length ranging from 7 up to 10 lm and an inner diameter ranging from 20 up to 100 nm [32,57,58,66,72,118,164,172] (Fig. 3). The existence of spaces among the nanotubes is beneficial for the transport of waste and nutrients, and therefore for cell metabolism [60,173]. Depending on the anodization processing, the pore diameter of titanium oxide nanotubes can reach similar dimensions to that found in\n120 J.C.M. Souza et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 94 (2019) 112–131\nbone tissue. The diameter of pores (3–12% porosity) of cortical bone is about 10–500 mm, while cancellous bone pores (50–90%) reveal diameter ranging from 0.2 up to 1 mm [18,33,160,174]. Also, nanotubes mimic the size and the arrangement of collagen fibrils of the bone tissue [33,64,175].\nThe nanotube length seems to influence the surface biocompatibility while nanotube diameter shows a critical impact on cell adhesion and proliferation [123,176,177]. The optimal diameter size of nanotubes seems to be around 70 nm to result in beneficial osteoconductivity when compared with 30 and 110 nm diameter nanotubes [39,64,176]. Previous studies reported an increased proliferation and differentiation of osteogenic cells on TiO2 nanotubes of about 80 nm in diameter [39,89,126,178]. An increase in the electrolyte water content for the electrochemical procedure induces the dissolution of TiO2 on the nanotubes surface resulting in enlargement of the pore diameter [62]. An enhancement of cell adhesion and proliferation was noted after an additional thermal oxidation treatment of anodized surfaces [164]. The thermal oxidation is named annealing, which leads to the formation of crystalline phases of rutile or anatase, depending on the thermal treatment. Anatase is formed on annealing at about 450 C while rutile predominates at 600 C for 3 h [58,179]. The relative amount of anatase growth is higher for the surfaces anodized at a high voltage when compared to the surfaces anodized at a low voltage [179]. Therefore, the crystallization of nanotubes increases the wettability of the annealed surfaces [62,180,181] leading to an increase in protein adsorption and cell filopodes’ spreading into the hollow space of the nanotubes [118] (Fig. 4). Filopodia take place on the movement of microtubules and actin of the cells onto the substrate and surrounding environment. Different patterns and scales of surface features determine the filopodia degree of the osteogenic cells that guide the synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix and new bone [182,183].\nNanostructured implant surfaces coupled with a bioactive surface chemistry have promoted adsorption of selective proteins such as vitronectin and fibronectin, and stimulated the osteogenic cell migration and differentiation. Nanotubes-functionalized surfaces show early deposition of Ca and PO4 and increased density of osteogenic cells in comparison to smooth surfaces [57,118].\nSurfaces composed of anatase-based nanotubes have shown the lowest water contact angles that indicates a super-hydrophilicity [32,171], while clustering of nanotubes due to the thermal treatment at high temperature (e.g., rutile nanotube formation) decreases the wettability of the surfaces [32,90]. The porosity and surface energy of the tubular TiO2 layer also play critical role over the surface wettability. The surface energy can be amplified from 23.72 mJ/m2 (bare titanium surface) to 87.11 mJ/m2 (nanotubular surface). Alongside, the anodization surface modification can decrease the water contact angle on titanium surface down to 3.25 ± 1 on nanotubular structures, that denotes a ultra-high hydrophilicity [32,90]. Although previous studies stated that nanotubes effectively improved osteogenesis, it remains unknown\nwhether these findings are consistent under pathological oxidative stress condition, such as osteoporosis or osteoarthritis. A previous study evaluated the oxidation resistance and osteogenesis capabilities of different TiO2 nanotubes after H2O2 treatment, mimicking pathological oxidative stress [184]. Nanotubes with large diameter showed better results on cell adhesion, viability, and differentiation of osteogenic cells after H2O2 treatment. Furthermore, large nanotubes showed a higher antioxidant potential and would be valuable on endosseous implants for patients suffering from bone degenerative disease [184].\nRegarding the mechanical behavior, the TiO2 nanotubular layer has a lower elastic modulus (at around 36–43 GPa) than that recorded on cp Ti (110–140 GPa). In fact, the elastic modulus of TiO2 nanotubes has closer magnitude to that recorded on cortical bone (11–30 GPa). A match in elastic modulus magnitude can avoid abrupt changes in stress distribution at the bone-implant interface and then decrease the stress shielding phenomenon and bone loss [66,185]. On implant placement, the wear resistance of\nJ.C.M. Souza et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 94 (2019) 112–131 121\ntitanium nanotubes to delamination by chipping become an advantage when compared to ordinary surface coatings (e.g., hydroxyapatite or nitride coatings) once the titanium-based nanotubes possess a gradual structural transition from the bulk substrate towards to the surface [57,60,63,186,187]. A previous study evaluated the simultaneous wear and corrosion behavior of titanium surfaces modified by nanotubes formation [187]. A thick layer of nanotubular structure provided a high wear resistance concerning friction forces against bone during implant placement into the surgical site. In addition, the corrosion resistance and biocompatibility of the nanotubular surfaces can be improved after electrochemical modification by doping with Ca and P followed by thermal oxidation [58,63,187].\nThe formation of TiO2 nanotubes is a promising alternative to develop localized drug delivery systems that possess the capability to overcome limitations of systemic drug therapies. This advanced drug release strategy holds the capability of delivering several drugs for a pre-programmed time to allow a later release [188]. Titanium nanotubes present beneficial properties for drug delivery application, including controllable nanotube dimensions, tunable geometries and surface chemistry, high surface area, high and versatile drug-loading capacity for several drugs, and ability to modulate drug release kinetics [188]. Considering the ordinary electrochemical method to manufacture nanotubes onto the titanium surface is accomplished in electrolyte solution on a determined voltage and time, the manufacturing of standard dental implants is viable on an industrial point of view. Taking into account the studies on nanotube formation on titanium are current, the certification of the nanotube-modified implants depends on the clinical benefits and manufacturer interests.\n3.4. LASER surface modification\nThe use of laser for structuring implant surfaces provides distinct advantages when compared to ordinary surface modification methods [189]. Laser-structuring treatment have been receiving special attention from scientists and engineers as powerful and versatile tool for further improving the biological response to titanium dental implants. The main advantage involves the capability of hierarchically controlling the surface texture (by producing pits, grooves, ablation tracks, ripples, pillars, columns, as seen in Fig. 5) and the chemical composition using different laser-based\napproaches and techniques such as: laser ablation, laser induced periodic surface structures (LIPSSs), laser melting, laser cladding, laser engineered net shaping (LENSTM), direct laser interference patterning (DLIP), and matrix assisted pulsed evaporation (MAPLE) [190–201]. Neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG), copper–vapor, Nd:glass (silicate or phosphate glasses), the diode laser, and the excimer laser have been commonly used among the currently available lasers. Ultrahigh precision machined metallic surfaces can be produced at low thermal load and free of contaminants by using picosecond (10 12 s) and femtosecond (10 15 s) short pulse duration lasers [196,197,202-205] The modification of the titanium oxide thickness and chemical composition can be coordinated by the proper selection of laser processing parameters.\nScrew-shaped cp-Ti implant surfaces have been laser-modified via the production of a micropattern array (composed of hemispherical pits of 19 lm diameter, 8 lm depth, and spaced at 20 lm) using a Nd:YAG laser [29]. The BIC percentage was higher for the micropatterned surface than that for machined implants for 12 weeks of bone healing in rabbits. The bioactive potential of these surfaces can be further enhanced by biomimetic functionalization by combining different techniques [191]. In a previous study, the BIC percentage was higher for the HAp coated/laserablated and for the uncoated/laser-ablated implants than that found for the machined implants after 4 week tissue healing in rabbit cortical bone [201]. Additionally, the removal torque values for HAp coated, laser-ablated implants were significantly higher than that recorded for uncoated/laser-ablated and the uncoated/machined implants [191]. A previous study reported an increase in hydrophilicity by producing ripples, nanopillars, and microcolumns on titanium surfaces using the laser treatment [196].\nThe Laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSSs) consists of parallel rippled (surface gratings) or wavy surface features that can be either produced by continuous wave (CW) or by pulsed irradiation under right selection of laser processing parameters. It has been shown that the anisotropy at the LIPSSs controls the osteoblast alignment on titanium or CoCr surfaces, thus inducing the orientation of a collagen/apatite extracellular matrix [207]. The LIPSS may therefore be applied for increasing and guiding the adsorption of adhesion proteins responsible for bone growth, by structurally appropriating construction of the anisotropic bone tissue microstructure.\nrface at the positions of intensity maxima.

Souza et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 94 (2019) 112–131\nIn other studies [193,208], the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells into an osteoblast lineage (bone-like cells) and the formation of bone-like nodules (matrix mineralisation) has been shown to be significantly enhanced in the presence of LIPSS and nanopillars (NP) textures on titanium surfaces. The same effect was reported in other studies [209,210] involving composite textures on titanium surfaces, i.e., nanotextured microcolumns, or a combination of LIPSSs and micropits. At the same time, it has been shown that LIPSS and NP textures on titanium surfaces may have a significant impact on reducing the short-time adhesion and biofilm formation of bacterial cells (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) [211]. The production of titanium implants surfaces with enhanced biointegration properties and reduced infections risk have been shown to be achieved by the LIPSSs.\nThe effect of laser melting on titanium implant osseointegration was reported by previous studies [206,212]. Machined or gritblasted screw-shaped titanium implants were melted using a Nd:glass laser at 30 ns pulse duration and 0.5–3 J pulse energy. The surface revealed partially overlapped craters within a honeycomb pattern due to the change in the liquid-free melting spot shape followed by a fast crystallization [212]. The molten material is pushed toward the intensity minima due to Marangoni convection, resulting from a high temperature gradient between interference maxima and minima positions (Fig. 5D-F). Another study reported an increase in wettability of a Ti64l4V surface treated by a highpower diode laser [213]. Also, the proliferation and viability of fetal osteoblasts (hFOB 1.19) was higher on the laser-treated surfaces when compared to untreated ones [213]. A deposition of HAp coating on titanium was performed by using a laser-cladding method based on a pulsed Nd:YAG laser and lateral powder feeding [189,214]. The HAp coating consisted of a gradated and layered structure composed of crystalline and amorphous phases near the surface followed by tricalcium phosphate (TCP), Ca3Ti2O7, amorphous HAp, and CaTiO3 while a layer based on CaAl2O4, Ca5Ti4O13, Ca3Ti2O7 formed close to the titanium substrate interface [214]. The surface coated with the gradated HAp layer revealed a high cytocompatibility in the presence of MG63 osteoblasts [214]. The physicochemical properties of the bioactive ceramic coating depend on the laser method parameters [189,214]. The coating of titanium with TCP was also carried out by using a Laser-engineered Net Shaping (LENSTM) machine with laser beam power of 400 and 500W and scanning speeds at 10 or 15 mm s 1\n[198]. The ceramic coating thickness has been shown to increase with increasing laser power and/or powder feed rate and to decrease with increasing scanning speed. The TCP coatings revealed enhanced cell differentiation, ECM formation, and biomineralization.\nThe DLIP (Direct Laser Interference Patterning) technique uses two or more lasers simultaneously to produce different microscale patterns with line-, pillar-, and hole-like characteristics on titanium implants, as can be seen in Fig. 5D-F [195,215]. The same features previously described for LIPSSs and related to the ability of manipulating cell and bacteria attachment by adjusting the topographical properties can also be achieved using the DLIP technique.\n3.5. Biomimetic functionalization of implant surfaces\nRecent approaches are based on biomimesis of the structural and biochemical composition and interactions of bone and other surrounding peri-implant soft tissues. Dental implant surfaces have been modified with growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, peptides, and drugs. These biofunctional coatings aimed enhancing and maintaining osseointegration as well as periimplant soft tissue integration, and decrease the risks of periimplant inflammatory reactions induced by biofilms [25].\nBioabsorbable polymeric coatings on titanium surfaces can incorporate bioactive compounds, leading to the release of osteoconductive or anti-microbial molecules over the time of bone healing [10]. Bone growth agents such as transforming growth factor (TGF-b1), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1 and 2), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are some of the main candidates for such purpose [14,216,217]. BMPs regulate genes for collagen, alkaline phosphatase, and osteopontin, while BMP-2, -4, and -7 exclusively stimulate bone formation. The application of such proteins are strategically beneficial although can be unpractical due to their low chemical stability, high costs, patient-related ratio, and solubility in biological fluids [14]. It is worthwhile stressing that zeroorder type release is the most satisfactory release strategy for drug-releasing implants, which results in the drug being released at constant rate independent of concentration and time [188,218].\nHydroxyapatite (HAp) has been deposited onto titanium surfaces [221] or into TiO2 nanotubes either by wet chemistry or by immersing the nanotubes in simulated body fluid containing calcium and phosphorous. The presence of HAp in TiO2 nanotubes was found to increase the integration of the implants to the bone tissue. Alternatively, TiO2 nanotubes were also modified using carbon nanotubes, polymers, and proteins to enhance bone ingrowth [219]. Thin films of polymeric materials and heat-sensitive biomolecules can be produced by using a matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) under low thermal and chemical degradation [192]. In this way, HAp or titanium can be coated with bioasorbable biomolecules that might mimic the bone structure and therefore enhance the stimulation of osteogenic cells [220].\nSimulated body fluid (SBF) is the most common way to deposit HAp on modified titanium surfaces as well as, more recently, TiO2 nanotubes. When the pH is approximately 7.4, the titania-OH groups are negatively charged, due to the presence of deprotonated acidic hydroxides. Calcium ions (Ca2+) are then adsorbed from the SBF to the surface of the nanotubes, as a result of the negatively charged surface. Also, H2PO4 can easily react with the asadsorbed Ca2+ to finally form calcium phosphate. Furthermore, electrochemical deposition, physical vapor deposition, hydrothermal treatment, and wet chemistry synthesis can be used to intensify the deposition of bioactive molecules in titanium nanotubes. It was found that the longer the length of the TiO2 nanotubes, the higher the amount of HAp formed on its surface [168]. Titanium nanotubes filling with synthetic polymers might decrease the diameter of the nanotubes. However, this technique may be used to control the nanotubes diameter for controlled drug delivery release [188]. A previous study investigated the effect of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) coating on an anodized titanium implant surface by using electrospray. Histomorphometric analysis showed significantly higher mean bone-to-implant contact percentage for implants treated with PLGA/bFGF than those recorded for anodized or anodized and coated with PLGA. Thus, it was suggested that coating titanium implants with PLGA incorporating bFGF by electrospray might stimulates bone formation of an implant placed in bone [222].\nConsidering the treatment of some complex diseases that require more than one kind of drug, a new concept of using polymeric micelles as nanocarriers were integrated into TiO2 nanotubes for designing implants with advanced multi-drug releasing. Drug-loaded carriers molecules and nano-sites can be selected for the multi-drug delivery system for short- or longterm bone healing process. Release profiles of this multi-drug delivery system can be controlled by adjusting the length and pore diameters of nanotubes, surface properties of micelles and their loading conditions (Fig. 6) [188].\nJ.C.M. Souza et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 94 (2019) 112–131 123\nOther recent strategies are based on modifications of titanium surfaces with mono or multi-molecular coatings containing extracellular matrix proteins, peptides, peptidomimetics, and/or recombinant biopolymers. Taking advantage of the functional and chemical versatility of the biological molecules promising methods have been developed to coat implant surfaces and enhance the bone healing process. These methods are mainly based on three basic strategies of molecule immobilization; i.e., physical adsorption, physical entrapment, and covalent binding [223]. Covalent binding improves the stability of the biofunctional coating and therefore it is the main pathway for immobilizing peptides with short sequences. This has been accomplished with different methods, including the use of silanes, surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization of vinyl monomers, peptides containing RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp), thiols or phosphonates to form selfassembled monolayers, poly (L-lysine)-graft-poly (ethylene glycol) molecules as spacers, oligonucleotides, and cathecol based molecules, such as DOPA [84,224,225].\nCollagen, the main organic component of the extracellular matrix of bone, has been used to functionalize titanium dental implants, both for improving osseointegration [226] and to improve soft tissue growth and thus, permucosal seal [227]. Other proteins with significant biological activity for cell attachment to the extracellular matrix, such as fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin, and bone mineralization, such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein have also been used to coat titanium [77,228]. The application of large extracellular matrix proteins is an interesting approach although it can be unpractical due to their low chemical stability and fast resorbability in biological fluids [14]. Additionally, proteins from animal origin raise concerns about immunological undesired reactions. This requires significant attention to protein purification, which raises costs of protein production [229]. Alternatively, short oligopeptides and peptidomimetics containing RGD sequence (Arg-Gly-Asp) have also been used to modify titanium implant surfaces [77,80,224,225]. The most advantageous property of RGD molecules is that they are small and chemically defined, which implies that they can be synthesized, modified, or reconstructed [229]. Several conformations and moieties of oligopeptides and peptidemimetics are studied to enhance the RGD sequence onto titanium surfaces and enhance the osseointegration process [77,225]. This includes linear and cyclic peptides to enhance cell recruitment [230], peptides to improve osseointegration [231], peptides to induce permucosal sealing [232], antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides [233], and different methods and platforms for immobilizing multiple different peptides on titanium to achieve multi-bioactive dental implants [79,234].\nAnother alternative to the use of full extracellular matrix proteins is recombinant polymers inspired by extracellular matrix proteins that have significant design versatility and precision to provide chemical groups for effective immobilization on titanium substrates as well as (multi) bio functionality [235]. These coatings\nhave proved to withstand surgical implantation and promote rapid osseointegration, enabling earlier implant loading and potentially preventing micromotion that leads to aseptic loosening and premature implant failure. The development of hybrid coatings; that is, an organic layer that is further mineralized with calcium phosphates is an attractive strategy to design titanium surfaces with structural similarities to bone for improving osseointegration [236].\n3.6. Functionalization of titanium to inhibit biofilm accumulation\nMicrobial colonization on rough titanium surfaces or at retentive areas such as implant-abutment and abutment-crown joints has been reported in the literature [237,238]. Biofilms are organized microbial multi-species agglomerates of microbial cells embedded in an extracellular polymeric matrix, that allows genetic exchange, quorum sensing communication, and provides nutrient supply for bacteria (Fig. 7). Additionally, the extracellular polymeric matrix acts as a biological barrier that protects bacteria from antibiotics and host immune responses [237,239–241]. The knowledge of biofilm composition related to environmental and nutritional conditions is a key role to understanding its effect on the performance of dental implants and prostheses. Titanium surface properties provide a selective effect on configuration and conformation of adsorbed proteins that are adsorbed on the substrate and bacterial cell adhesion.\nStudies on anti-biofilm activity of different agents have usually used single and genetically characterized microbial strains (monospecies biofilms). In such cases, it is necessary to consider not only the species assessed, but also the various interactions that may occur among the microorganisms especially during multi-species biofilm formation. Additionally, most studies assess the antimicrobial behavior of compounds by using planktonic bacterial cultures while it is known that the effects of antimicrobial agents on planktonic microorganisms do not reflect their effect on microorganisms organized in biofilms. In this way, there is a need to emphasize that the results of several surface treatments are directly influenced by the relationships and combinations of different microbial species.\nSystemic antibiotic therapy is not always effective to treat local infections since a vascular insuffciency can occur [242,243]. Furthermore, antibiotic molecules can be inactivated by chemical and pH variation of the host bloodstream and therefore high systemic antibiotic doses can cause accumulative side effects to the organism [238,241,244]. Hence, local drug delivery of antibacterial biomolecules or antibiofilm compounds becomes an important clinical approach, since biofilms are naturally found in the oral environment and, may easily adhere to titanium implant surfaces provoking postoperative peri-implant infections [245].\nPeri-implantitis induced by biofilm accumulation is also a major concern. This is a destructive inflammatory process similar to periodontitis, that occurs around dental implants, promoting\n124 J.C.M. Souza et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 94 (2019) 112–131\nmarginal bone loss. Changes in surface characteristics, such as chemical composition and roughness, influence biofilm accumulation and, consequently, osseointegration [246,247]. For instance, nanostructured surfaces (e.g., titanium surfaces modified by nanotubes) can increase the microbial adhesion and proliferation that might cause bacterial infection and implant failure. Thus, nanostructured surfaces should be chemically modified to inhibit or reduce bacterial attachment (Fig. 7). Previous studies found that Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli may delay bone formation leading to implant failure. An increased adhesion and proliferation of S. aureus along with mesenchymal stem cells was noticed. Then, several antibacterial agents were incorporated into nanotubes to achieve bacterial inhibition [248–251].\nConsidering the loading and delivery capability provided by the presence of nanotubes, embedding antimicrobial components could even improve the titanium surface performance. Thus, methodologies have been developed to reach this purpose. Nanotube-modified titanium implant surface can locally deliver antimicrobials to defeat pathogenic bacterial growth. For instance, dental implant surfaces modified within nanotubes and then loaded with doxycycline were capable to inhibit Porphyromonas gingivalis over a period of 28 days [71]. The antibiotic therapy is also dependent on the drug content to avoid bacterial accumulation without cause harmful bacterial resistance of pathogenic species. A previous study reported the inhibition of S. aureus adhesion onto titanium surfaces treated by non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma [265]. Recent studies also reported the beneficial effects of titanium surfaces modified with nanotubes followed by oxidation in super oxidized water (SOW) to decrease the adhesion and viability of S. aureus free of negative effect on osteoblasts and chondrocytes [169,170]. Thus, high concentrations of oxygen and fluorine on titanium nanotube surfaces have proven to enhance the biological and antibacterial activities [169,253].\nInterestingly, nanoparticles with antibacterial element incorporation into titanium-based nanotubes were effective to improve\nFig. 7. Biofilm growth on titanium alloy surfaces modified or not with nanotubes. Study [219].\nthe antibacterial properties compared with the antibiotic-loaded biodegradable polymers incorporation. Hence, metallic elements, including Zn or Ag were embedded to enhance the antibacterial properties [219,254]. Among those antibacterial pharmaceutical agents, Zn, especially ZnO nanoparticles have shown an in vitro and in vivo potential of inhibiting S. aureus [255,256] as well as several types of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [257]. Zn is an important trace element in the human body that can improve DNA synthesis, enzyme activity, and nucleic acid metabolic activity [258]. Likewise, Zn ions have the ability to promote osteoblast proliferation and enhance biomineralization [61,257]. Therefore, ZnO nanoparticles, which contained Zn ions, could reduce bacteria survival. The antibacterial effect of Ag nanoparticles arises from the interaction between the positive Ag ions and the negatively charged bacterial cell wall, where the Ag nanoparticles increase bacterial cell wall permeability and therefore inhibiting bacterial growth [69,259]. Titanium-based nanotubes loaded with cephalothin, minocycline, or amoxicillin combined with Ag nanoparticles have been evaluated against a range of bacterial strains. The combination of two antibacterial approaches was found to be more effective on the bacterial strains compared to using only one approach [260].\nHowever, the amount and size of metallic ions such as Zn or Ag has to be strictly controlled to avoid toxicity effects to the surrounding tissue [254]. The delivery of metallic ions and particles to the bone tissue and blood vessels can be systemically distributed to other organs (e.g., liver, spleen, and lymphnodes) as already reported in previous studies. Metallic particles like vanadium (V), aluminium (Al), cobalt (Co), silver (Ag) are reported as toxic at high content and they can disturb DNA of the cells depending on the content and size of the metals [261–263]. In vitro studies have shown an increase in the expression of inflammatory cytokines, activation of osteoclasts and morphologic alterations on neutrophils and macrophages when metallic ions were released at exposed periimplant tissues [262]. A reduction in cell viability, increased oxida-\non the desinfection of titanium alloy surfaces using super-oxidized water solution\nJ.C.M. Souza et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 94 (2019) 112–131 125\ntive stress, and an amplified frequency of mutation have been linked to nano-scale particles (ranging from 1 to 100 nm) released from dental implants [261]. In fact, the toxicity of metallic ions and debris released from implants depends on the metallic content, anatomical site, physicochemical properties and size of the particles, metallic content, and host immune response. In vitro and in vivo toxicity studies should overcome issues related to the biological methods, type of cells, animal study design, health state of animal or patient, physicochemical methods to inspect the debris.\nBiodegradable polymers coating is another method to control the drug release kinetics from titanium-based nanotubes, as mentioned in the previous section of this integrative literature review. By coating the entire nanotube using a simple and inexpensive technique, such as dip or spin coating, drug release rate can be reduced by 30–60% [264]. Finally, heat treatment after anodic oxidation of titanium changes the crystalline structure of TiO2 layer, and reduces bacterial attachment without compromising cell metabolism [247].\n4. Concluding remarks\nThe present comprehensive integrative review has shown the major innovative technological developments of titanium dental implant surfaces. That involved experimental procedure and main biological outcomes of titanium surfaces modified by ordinary and advanced physicochemical techniques. Ordinary techniques such as the combination of grit-blasting, acid-etching, and surface conditioning are currently utilized by manufacturers of dental implants. The resultant high hydrophilicity and nanostructured morphological aspects of the titanium surface modified by the combination of techniques are responsible for shortening the first phase of osseointegration that involves the blood platelet activation, protein adsorption, three-dimensional fibrin clot cross-linking, osteogenic cell migration, collagen deposition, and bone matrix formation.\nThe use of technological biomimetic methods for nanomodification of implants is an emerging field with significant potential for implant surface modification and localized drug delivery biomaterials. Laser-based, thermal oxidative, and electrochemical techniques have boosted the development of various novel enhanced nanostructured materials and drug carriers, including titanium-based nanotubes, peptides, polymer micelles, liposomes vesicle, multifunctional dendritic polymers, nanocapsules, nanospheres, and other bioactive ceramicmaterials. The structural organization and chemical composition of nano-structured surfaces involving nano-scale pores or irregularities (e.g., spike-like and nano arrays features) on titanium implant and biomaterials become a key factor to mimic the natural structure of bone and soft tissues and therefore to enhance the bone healing process. The association of different emerging technological methods such as titanium nanotube formation is an interesting strategy to produce hybrid implant and biomaterials involving a combined micro- and nanoscale structure composed of inorganic and organic bioactive materials. For instance, additive methods such as using laser techniques allows to hierarchically regulate the surface texture by producing\npits, grooves, and ablation tracks. Nanostructured implant surfaces coupled with bioactive compounds or proteins have promoted adsorption of selective proteins such as vitronectin and fibronectin within the osseointegration process. In fact, nano-roughness, chemical composition, and hydrophilicity of implant surfaces can determine the adhesion of osteogenic cells and therefore to avoid the bacterial accumulation during the healing process and maintenance of the soft and bone tissues surrounding the implant. Further studies should deal with the combination of current methods considering the micro- and nano-scale to enhance both osseointegration process and anti-biofilm effect. Also, the design of the dental implant must fit the peri-implant anatomical aspects to maintain a long-term health state and pathological avoid bone loss.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors acknowledge the support provided by the following FCT-Portugal projects: UID/EEA/04436/2013, NORTE-01-0145FEDER-000018 – HAMaBICo.\nReferences\n[1] P.I.
