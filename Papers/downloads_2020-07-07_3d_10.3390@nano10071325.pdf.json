      "text" : "The detection and treatment or removal of harmful materials in water are essential for environmental protection. Typically, dissolved material in water can be detected using several methods such as absorbance spectroscopy, biological oxygen demand (BOD) [1,2] and chemical oxygen demand (COD) [3,4] evaluation, colorimetry [5], gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) [6], surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy [7–10], electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) [11–13], and electrical conductivity detection. Few biological agents, i.e., bacteria and viruses, can be detected through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [14–16]. However, these methods may require reagents and instrumentation that are cost-intensive. They also are difficult in processing real-time and long-term applications for drinking water monitoring. Fortunately, the dissolution of many biological or chemical materials typically leads to sudden alterations in the refractive index of water. Thus, real-time monitoring of the water refractive index potentially ensures the overall safety of drinking or effluent water. High-sensitivity sensors and methods of long-term durability are demanded for ultralow refractive index changes and high stability in water monitoring [17–19]. The total internal reflection (TIR) of light inside the surface of a prism is sensitive to the change of the surrounding material (e.g., air or liquid). The sensitivity of the refractive index detection can\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1325; doi:10.3390/nano10071325 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1325 2 of 14\nbe improved further through a Kretschmann configuration [20–26]. A subsystem of a fixed small tank or chamber with inlet and outlet on the surface of a prism can be used to detect the refractive index of the flowing-through liquid. The detection prism surface is covered with an additional metal, thin film, which induces surface plasmon resonance (SPR) through TIR coupling of the incident light. Generation of SPR in the collective oscillation of free electrons at the metal–dielectric interface leads to a dip in the reflection spectrum. The so-called attenuated total reflection (ATR) method is based on ultrahigh sensitivity to the changes in the refractive index of the covering dielectric material, i.e., target solutions [21,27–36]. Moreover, nano roughness or sculptured structures on the thin film [37–43] further provides high-sensitivity, localized SPR modes and high specific surface area, which can lead to increased sensitivity to the refractive index of the covering material in many applications [25,27,44–59]. Nanoparticles, nanostructures, and thin films constructed with a metal material can also induce localized SPR under light illumination [25,27,44–62]. It is beneficial to fabricate metal nanoparticles or nanostructures in suitable sizes to detect SPR refractive indexes with high sensitivity at a specific wavelength of light. Peng et al. measured refractive index changes at a sensitivity of 6.3 × 10−8 RIU by using a Ag nanoparticle-based sensor [21]. Optical responses of array-structured nanomaterials or (random) photonic crystals can also be largely altered by changing surrounding materials [20,46–58]. The light transmission–absorption spectrum of metal 2D array nanostructures can effectively provide highly accurate refractive index measurements of the liquid sample [47,50–55]. Arrays are built using Ag and dielectric nanospheres or nanorods [50], Ag shell dielectric–core nanorods [47], metal–dielectric nanorods with or without a rotational angle [51], protruding metal nanorods (MNRDs) in a core–shell nanorod [52], MNRDs with connected veins [53], Ag-coated Si nanorods [54], and nanorods with crosshairs [55]. A metal–insulator–metal (MIM) sensor structure coupled with several Ag nanorod defects in a T-shape cavity [59] presents a relatively high sensitivity for refractive index sensing. Thus, a layer of vertical standing rods in the Kretschmann configuration can be useful as a sensing medium. However, Ag has high chemical activity; oxidization of Ag nanoparticles can significantly reduce the sensitivity of refractive index measurements. Moreover, the deposited noble metal layers tend to peel off easily from the substrate due to low adhesion, and this is a disadvantage for long-term use. High-sensitivity plasmonic refractive index detection in the long-term monitoring of liquid requires metal-like materials with high chemical stability. The nanostructures of metal-like materials can further increase the sensitivity of the detection system. In 2010, Naik et al. applied hard TiN with high chemical stability and achieved a charge carrier density of approximately 1022 cm−3 [63,64]. In 2011, Chen et al. fabricated TiN with a charge carrier density of 6.6 × 1022 cm−3. The TiN layer has a high carrier concentration and low chemical activity, like metal [65]. In 2011, Kumar et al. presented an inclined deposition method to grow inclined crystal rods [66]. In general, TiN layers have high chemical and electrical stability that can be used for fabricating supercapacitors [67], lithium hosts in batteries [68], and electrochemical hydrogen storage [69]. Deposited TiN layers [63–72] of nanostructures are good plasmonic materials and can be used to fabricate novel sensors with long-term stability. In practical setup, the plasmonic ATR sensing process is commonly categorized into four basic types: (i) angular interrogation (i.e., change of the resonant angle), (ii) intensity interrogation (i.e., change of reflectance at a fixed incident angle), (iii) wavelength interrogation (i.e., change of resonant wavelength at a fixed incident angle), and (iv) phase interrogation (i.e., the phase difference between P- and S-polarized light in the reflection spectrum) [22,27]. Among these, the phase interrogation technique provides the most sensitive measurements [28–36]. In our previous work, the wavelength of incident light was found to affect detection sensitivity in SPR temperature monitoring [30]. Moreover, SPR phase interrogation at the particular incident wavelength provided a high-resolution angular measurement and other applications [31,73–77]. In the Kretschmann configuration, the generated SPR mode is affected by the wavevector of incident light and material properties of the substrate, covering layer, and the SPR generating metallic\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1325 3 of 14\nlayer. On fixing the material properties of the metallic layer and substrate, the material property, i.e., refractive index, of the covering layer can be resolved by the SPR or plasmonic optical response modes concerning various wavevectors of incident light. Angular and wavelength interrogation both introduce variations in the wavevector of incident light to resolve the refractive index of the covering material. Chen et al. [65] demonstrated that TiN has a relatively low charge carrier density compared with Ag and had a broader valley in the angular and wavelength interrogation measurements. This means that the lowest point of the valley cannot be identified clearly under external optical or electrical interference if the TiN layer is chosen to be the SPR generator in Kretschmann configuration measurements. The modified method suggested by Nelson et al. [28] (see Equation (4)), using slopes of the data curve to estimate the covering material’s refractive index, has presented good sensitivity [20,21,44] with Ag or other noble metals used in the SPR generator. The modified method only needs the metallic material to have enough charge carrier concentration to generate SPR and introduces variations in plasmonic reflections and phase differences for P- and S-polarized incident light. Based on this modification, the detection limit (RIU) of the modified phase interrogation technique is inversely proportional to the typically used definition of sensitivity (nm/RIU) in evaluating a plasmonic sensor. The detection limit refers to the lowest difference in measurements for the point-by-point conversion of the refractive index. It was used in this study to make sure it did not cause confusion with typically used “sensitivity.” In this study, a TiN layer was deposited in compact standing crystal rods, which provided high-sensitivity refractive index measurements. An additional stacked layer of inclined-deposited TiN (i-TiN) nanorods can increase the specific surface area to contact the target solution, which results in a further enhanced sensitivity in experimental measurements. High chemical stability of the TiN layer facilitated consistent measurements in the cycling of clean-and-reuse experiments, indicating the long-term durability. Analytical solutions with multiple-layer reflectivity and phase differences based on the Fresnel equation were also acquired by illuminating light on a 46 nm TiN layer to cover liquids with various refractive indexes."

The refractive index estimation was based on the slope of the data curve with incident light at around 49.7°.

In order to acquire the detection limit or smallest refractive index unit (RIU) ( ) resolvable in reflectivity and phase measurements, we followed the definitions of Nelson et al.

The slopes ∆ /∆ of the phase measurements for a 46 nm TiN layer with and without an additional 1.4 nm iTiN layer were 6.1 × 10−5 and 1.2 × 10−4, respectively. Therefore, the acquired refractive index detection limit for glucose solution in the phase mode increased to 6.1 × 10−7 RIU with the addition of a 1.4 nm i-TiN layer. This was better than the 1.2 × 10−6 RIU obtained with the 46 nm TiN layer (Figure 6b). The experimental results showed that the phase difference data (Figures 5d and 6b) had higher consistency than that in the reflectivity (Figures 5c and 6a) concerning various refractive indexes. The modification with Equation (4) presented higher stability of acquired data in phase difference measurements. Addition of the i-TiN layer further decreased the detection limit. The Nelson’s modification of phase difference measurements and additional i-TiN layer in combination presented the lowest detection limit of 6.1 × 10−7 RIU in our measurements.\nFigure 5. (a) Reflectivity and (b) phase differences with various incident angles for various concentrations of glucose solution. The thickness of the deposited TiN layer is 46 nm. (c) Reflectivity and (d) phase for various refractive indexes (real part) of glucose solution using samples with various TiN layer thickness.\nThe additional i-TiN layers of various thicknesses further enhanced the reflectivity (Figure 6a,c) and precision of the phase difference (Figure 6b,d) measurements of the refractive indexes of variously concentrated glucose solutions. The additional 1.4 nm i-TiN layer improved the performance of the base 46 nm normally deposited TiN layer. In order to acquire the detection limit or smallest refractive index unit (RIU) (σn) resolvable in reflectivity and phase measurements, we followed the definitions of Nelson et al. [28] and our previous work [20,21,44] to consider the following quantity:\nσn = ( ∆n ∆φ ) σφ (4)\nwhere ∆n/∆φ is the local slope of the refractive index n versus phase φ curve, and σφ is the finest resolution available, which is 0.01◦, from the lock-in amplifier used in our experiments. The slopes ∆n/∆φ of the phase measurements for a 46 nm TiN layer with and without an additional 1.4 nm i-TiN layer were 6.1 × 10−5 and 1.2 × 10−4, respectively. Therefore, the acquired refractive index detection limit for glucose solution in the phase mode increased to 6.1 × 10−7 RIU with the addition of a 1.4 nm i-TiN layer. This was better than the 1.2 × 10−6 RIU obtained with the 46 nm TiN layer (Figure 6b). The experimental results showed that the phase difference data (Figures 5d and 6b) had higher consistency than that in the reflectivity (Figures 5c and 6a) concerning various refractive indexes.

The Nelson’s odification of phase difference measurements and additional i-TiN layer in combination presented\nthe lowest detection limit of 6.1 × 10−7 RIU in our measurements.\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1325 9 of 14Nanomaterials 2020, x, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 14\nFigure 6. Dependence of (a) reflectivity and (b) phase on the various refractive indexes (real part) of glucose solutions on the various inclined deposition lengths of 46 nm of TiN layers deposited on glass. Dependence of detection limit of (c) reflectivity and (d) phase on the various thicknesses of additional TiN layers.\nExperimental results presented that use of the SPR heterodyne phase interrogation system with low chemical activity and a reusable TiN layer was beneficial for refractive index detection in the liquid phase. The protruded nanorods can have a larger specific surface area to contact the target solution and further enhance the sensitivity of refractive index measurements in the SPR heterodyne phase interrogation system [20]. However, addition of an inclined-deposited TiN layer in the nanorod array reduced the carrier concentration. The increase of the i-TiN layer thickness gradually reduced the detection limit in measurements. The TiN-based sensor also presented potential reusability in three repeated trials. Results for 5% glucose solution were highly similar among the three repeated experiments. The intervals after every run involved cleaning with acetone, methanol, and deionized water sequentially. The experimental data in reflectivity (Figure 7a) and phase (Figure 7b) measurements presented similar results in three experiment runs. The deposited TiN layer provided stability and was reusable in multiple processes of refractive index sensors. The typically used thin metal films (e.g., Ag or Au) for plasmonic applications are easily oxidized or peeled from the substrate, which makes them unsuitable for reuse or long-term storage. Thus, the high stability and reusability of the deposited TiN layer could increase the long-lasting durability of plasmonic refractive index sensors or measurements in future applications.\nFigure 6.
