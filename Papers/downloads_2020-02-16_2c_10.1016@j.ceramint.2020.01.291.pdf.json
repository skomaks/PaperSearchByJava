Monolithic and graphite-doped TiC samples were manufactured at 1900 °C under 40 MPa for 10 min by spark plasma sintering method. Graphite nano-flakes enhanced the densification behavior, flexural strength, and friction coefficient of TiC ceramics. The XRD, microstructural, and thermodynamical assessments revealed the occurrence of a chemical reaction between the carbonaceous phase and TiC oxide layers, namely TiO2, and the formation of non-stochiometric TiCx and in-situ TiC. Although introducing nano-graphite as an additive decreased the Vickers hardness of TiC by ~34% (2071 HV0.1 Kg for the doped specimen), it had a positive influence on the flexural strength (504 and 633 MPa for monolithic and graphite doped samples; respectively). Finally, an average friction coefficient of 0.35 was obtained for TiC-5 wt% graphite ceramic, ~13% higher than that of the monolithic TiC sample."

      "text" : "When one of the transition metals, such as Ti, Zr, Hf, and Ta, located at IV-V-group combines with carbon, boron or nitrogen, a family of materials, named ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTC), is produced with melting points higher than 3000 °C. These promising substances have the capability to be applied in intense conditions, including aerospace, and many others such as metal refining, high-temperature electrodes, and nuclear fission reactors [1–11]. TiC belongs to this family of materials and offers a unique combination of qualities, namely excellent thermal and chemical stability, good electroconductivity, low density, elevated melting point, superior hardness, low thermal expansivity, appropriate thermal conductivity, and high wear resistance [12,13]. Accordingly, TiC has found lots of applications especially when alternations of load and temperature are severe. Hypersonic re-entry vehicles, rocket nozzle, jet engine components, throat liners, high-speed cutting tools, and leaning edge parts are among the main applications of this UHTC [14–26]. Nevertheless, TiC in monolithic form is not fit for use in all environments owing to the tendency to brittle fracture\nbecause of low fracture toughness, and at the same time, poor thermal shock resistance [19,27–29]. On the other hand, strong covalent bonds and low self-diffusion coefficient make this substance difficult to sinter. Besides, applying elevated sintering temperatures or rising the holding time to reach a dense ceramic can lead to the excessive growth of grains [30]. Lots of works have been accomplished to overcome these limitations by making composite or using new fabrication methods. Metals (Mo, Cr, Ni, Co) and ceramics (TiN, NbC, WC, and SiC) are among the frequent additives the impacts of which were studied on TiC [31–49]. Besides, it has been reported that the implementation of a newly developed technique, named spark plasma sintering (SPS) method [50–60], can remarkably improve the characteristics of TiC-based ceramics. In this technique, a high electrical current has been combined with a high external pressure, and the samples were sintered in a relatively short time. Consequently, it is possible to reach microstructurally uniform specimens with high densities [13,32,61–95]. The influences of various ceramic reinforcements/sintering aids have been investigated by some researchers. Sribalaji et al. [27] studied alternations in microstructure, fracture toughness, and thermal shock\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.291 Received 18 January 2020; Received in revised form 31 January 2020; Accepted 31 January 2020\n∗ Corresponding author. ∗∗ Corresponding author.

The in-situ formation of graphite nano ribbons (GNRs) was reported owing to CNT unzipping. The fracture toughness value rocketed by ~120% due to activating toughening mechanisms such as crack bifurcation, crack bridging, and grain wrapping. The thermal shock resistance also rose by ~50% by adding the additives. Cheng et al. [96] added 3.5 wt% WC as an additive to the TiC matrix, reaching a relative density higher than 98% for the specimens sintered by the SPS process at 1450 °C under 50 MPa for 5 min. However, with increasing the sintering temperature to 1600 °C, a fully dense material was obtained with outstanding mechanical properties, viz. a fracture toughness of ~6.5 MPa m1/2, a Vickers hardness of ~30 MPa, and a flexural strength of ~600 MPa. The effects of different vol% of TiB2 additive on the qualifications of TiC-SiCw were scrutinized by Fattahi et al. [73]. The XRD and SEM results confirmed the occurrence of chemical interactions among the oxide layers of B2O3 and TiO2, which were present on the initial powders, and SiCw, producing in-situ TiSi and TiC phases. Moreover, the best values of flexural strength (~510 MPa) and Vickers hardness (~28 GPa) were yielded by the samples with 0 vol% and 30 vol% silicon carbide whiskers. Ultimately, the examination of the SiCw additive revealed the formation of nonstochiometric TiCx and in-situ Ti3SiC2 phases. The samples reached maximum relative density when 20 vol% and 30 vol% SiCw were added to TiC. The most significant bending strength of ~650 MPa was recorded in specimens doped with 20 vol% additive [97]. Although quite a few researchers have studied various additives in TiC, no research is available on graphite sintering aid. In this paper, therefore, 5 wt% nano-sized graphite was added to the TiC matrix, and the consolidation behavior, microstructure, and mechanical characteristics of doped samples were compared to the monolithic one. Both monolithic and composite specimens were sintered by spark plasma sintering method at 1900 °C under 40 MPa for 10 min."

      "heading" : "2. Experimental procedure",
      "text" : "Table 1 presents the information associated with the starting powders selected among high-grade materials that were commercially available. The XRD assessments of initial materials (Fig. 1) revealed that the powders were pure or the impurity levels were so low that it was impossible to detect the materials. As mentioned above, two different TiC-based ceramic pellets were produced with 0 and 5 wt% graphite nano-flakes as additives. After weighing, the raw materials were dispersed in ethanol using an ultrasonic device for 120 min. In order to reach uniform mixtures, a hot plate (80 °C) equipped with a magnetic shaker was used for heating the dispersed mixtures. This level also led to wiping the ethanol medium out. Thereafter, the dried slurries were smashed and passed through a sieve to obtain homogenous granules and break down clustered powders. Before loading the specimens into the graphite die to put them into the SPS machine, the powder samples were covered by a layer of graphite foil. This layer was beneficial in avoiding chemical reactions between the die and the samples, and was removed by grinding after the sintering process. The specimens were pellet-shaped (3 cm in diameter) and sintered at 1900 °C under 40 MPa for 10 min. The bulk and theoretical densities were calculated by the Archimedes principle and the rule of mixtures; respectively. Then, the relative density of pellets was measured by having two pre-calculated densities. The phase and microstructure evaluations were accomplished by an XRD apparatus (Philips, PW3710 X) and a FESEM (Tescan, S8000) powered by an EDS analyzer;\nrespectively. HSC software was used to assess the probable chemical reactions among the available phases during the SPS process. The Vickers hardness values were measured by applying six indentations on the polished surfaces of samples (the applied load was 100 g). The flexural strength of prepared standard test samples (3 × 4 × 28 mm3\nwith a span length of 15 mm) was estimated by a three-point bending test using a universal testing machine (STM-250). Ultimately, the wear examinations were performed based on ASTM standard G99 on a pinon-disk device (model: WTH) under the load of 49 N with a sliding velocity of around 0.05 m/s. All exams were carried out at room\ntemperatures in a dry environment (no lubricant). The entire sliding distance was ~450 m on a diameter of 15 mm for each wear test. The spherical pin (1 mm diameter) of tungsten carbide slide against the rotating TiC-based disk-shaped samples."

      "text" : "The values of relative density associated with monolithic and doped samples sintered at 1900 °C under 40 MPa for 10 min clearly show the positive impact of using nano-graphite as an additive on the densification behavior of TiC (Fig. 2). The monolithic specimen reached a value of 95.5%, while this figure increased by around 1.5%, standing at 97.1% after using graphite. The XRD patterns related to the TiC and TiC-5 wt% graphite are illustrated in Fig. 3. In both samples, the formation of non-stochiometric TiC occurred with precipitating carbon at the grain boundaries. Besides, two various forms of graphite (rhombohedral and hexagonal) were detected in the XRD pattern of the doped specimen (Fig. 3b). The main difference between these forms of graphite is in their stability; the hexagonal form is stable, while the other is thermodynamically unstable. Literally, rhombohedral graphite can be considered as a stacking fault expanded in the hexagonal. In other words, natural graphite consists of both these allotropic forms (rhombohedral ~40%). Partial transformation of initial hexagonal graphite to rhombohedral can happen at elevated temperatures and under high pressures (similar to the SPS conditions). It should be mentioned that this unstable phase can transform into hexagonal at the temperatures higher than ~1330 °C [98]. On the other hand, it is well known that powders containing much titanium are covered by TiO2 oxide layers. These layers can chemically react with the graphite additive (Eq. (1))\nFig. 3. The XRD patterns associate with the as-produced; (a) TiC, and (b) TiC-5 wt% nano-graphite specimens.\nand form the in-situ TiC phase. As presented in Fig. 4, the Gibbs free energy of this reaction is negative at temperatures higher than ~1300 °C, indicating its favorability at the SPS conditions. This interaction provides a clean interface between TiC and graphite and can positively affect the mechanical properties. It should be noted that the carbon exited from the matrix in the monolithic samples can also interact with the TiO2 based on Eq. (1).\nTiO2 + 3C = TiC + 2CO (g) (1)"

According to these micrographs, the sintering circumstances were not appropriate to reach fully dense samples, leaving some pores in the matrix. However, some of these pores were not associated with the porosity but indicating the former places of grains or secondary-phases in which they were pulledout during preparing the specimens over the metallography process.

SEM images captured on the fracture surfaces of the as-produced (a, c) TiC, and (b, d) TiC-5 wt% nano-graphite specimens.\nFig. 5a, in addition to bright-colored TiC matrix, some darker phases can be seen that possibly belonged to precipitated carbon at the grain boundaries owing to the formation of non-stochiometric TiCx. Both of these phases and the remained graphite are detectable in Fig. 5b (related to doped sample). As mentioned before, non-stochiometric hexagonal Ti6C3.75 was formed at both specimens over the SPS process. Apparently, the application of high pressure along with the elevated temperature forced the cubic titanium carbide matrix to transform into a more compact structure (hexagonal) in some areas. Over this transformation, carbon exited from the matrix and precipitated at the grain boundaries. Fig. 6 (a & b) depicts the schematic sintering processes for both monolithic and doped samples, showing the neck formation and densification of the specimens over the sintering process. Besides, it can be seen that some pores remained at triple junctions, and the others are closed over the consolidation stage. The locations of precipitated carbon, remained graphite, and in-situ TiC (Eq. (1)) phases are illustrated in Fig. 6. Fig. 7(a–d) shows the SEM image of fractured TiC-5 wt % nano-graphite and the linked EDS maps. According to this figure, all present elements (Ti, C, and O) dispersed uniformly, indicating the proper preparation of specimens. Besides, the availability of TiO2 oxide layers can be confirmed owing to Fig. 7d.\nThe linear EDS evaluations are exhibited in Fig. 8. The titanium changes over the line (Fig. 8a) can derive from two sources, graphite or non-stoichiometric TiCx. A similar graph is indicated for C and O elements in Fig. 8b (zoomed-out image of EDS line analysis corresponding to oxygen and carbon lines). The areas with a high level of carbon possibly show remained graphite, and the zones with elevated oxygen level indicate titanium oxide layers. Fig. 9(a–d) presents SEM images of the fracture surfaces of as-sintered TiC and TiC-5 wt% nano-graphite. Although both intergranular and transgranular fracture modes are detectable at both samples, it seems that graphite addition led to more intergranular fractures in doped TiC. Although lots of porosity can be seen in both specimens, graphite had a beneficial effect on eliminating some porosity and reaching higher relative density. As noted before, graphite can reduce TiO2 and produce in-situ TiC. Not only this phenomenon enhanced the sinterability owing to eliminating harmful oxide layers, but it could also lead to a clean interface between the matrix and graphite. The grain sizes of both samples were roughly the same. Apparently, the precipitated carbon and the formation of in-situ TiC in the monolithic samples acted the same as a grain growth inhibitor similar to the role of graphite in the doped ones."

      "text" : "The Vickers hardness values of TiC and TiC-5 wt% nano-graphite are shown in Fig. 10. Monolithic TiC reached a Vickers hardness of 3128 HV0.1 Kg, while adding graphite as an additive decreased this\nvalue by around 34%. It seems that the remained graphite played the predominant role in decreasing the hardness of composite. Graphite is known as a very soft phase, and its presence in the TiC matrix can have a strong impact on the hardness. On the other hand, doped specimens represented better flexural strength (633 MPa) in comparison with the monolithic TiC (504 MPa), as shown in Fig. 11. As the grain sizes were approximately the same, relative density possibly had a chief effect on this improvement. As noted before, the interfaces between the TiC matrix and the remaining graphite were so clean that could improve the flexural strength by activating some toughening mechanisms (e.g. crack deflection).\nThe strength of a ceramic-based composite relies upon various items. Chemical composition and microstructure are among the most important factors affecting the strength. To reach the optimum balance of toughness, strength, and hardness, various surface, thermal, and mechanical treatment can be implemented. Dispersion strengthening and fine-grain strengthening are the most significant strengthening mechanisms for ceramic-based composites. In addition, crack branching, crack bridging, crack deflection, microcracking, and fine grain are chief toughening mechanisms for composites. On the other side, the difference between thermal expansion coefficients of secondary phase(s) and the matrix in composites uplifts the mechanical qualities including hardness, strength, creep resistance, etc. This phenomenon strengthens the composite by generating dislocations around the secondary phases. As dislocations in ceramics cannot move easily, they create networks dispersed into the matrix, acting as preferred locations for initiating microcracks. Generally, available reinforcements in a ceramic matrix strengthen the composite through at least two ways; (1) secondary phases can bridge a crack, and prohibit crack propagation by remaining interfaces united, and (2) cracks are deflected in another direction in facing a particle which is not easy to be broken or bypass [99,100].\nFig. 12 exhibits the variation of coefficient of friction (COF) with sliding distance for both monolithic and doped samples. The COF associated with the monolithic TiC rose from an initial level of 0.2 to 0.3 after around 50 m sliding distance (stabilizing stage) followed by some large fluctuations with an average of around 0.31. Besides, the unitability at the 100–200 m area can be due to the relatively high available porosity in the monolithic samples. On the contrary, the COF of doped specimens decreased from 0.45 to 0.29 after ~25 m and fluctuated between 0.28 and 0.41 with a mean value of 0.35. Possibly, the nonuniformity derived from the presence of secondary phases resulted in an increment in the COF of composite samples."

Monolithic and graphite-doped TiC samples were manufactured at 1900 °C under 40 MPa for 10 min by spark plasma sintering method. Graphite nano-flakes enhanced the densification behavior, flexural strength, and friction coefficient of TiC ceramics. The XRD, microstructural, and thermodynamical assessments revealed the occurrence of a chemical reaction between the carbonaceous phase and TiC oxide layers, namely TiO2, and the formation of non-stochiometric TiCx and in-situ TiC. Although introducing nano-graphite as an additive decreased the Vickers hardness of TiC by ~34% (2071 HV0.1 Kg for the doped specimen), it had a positive influence on the flexural strength (504 and 633 MPa for monolithic and graphite doped samples; respectively). Finally, an average friction coefficient of 0.35 was obtained for TiC-5 wt% graphite ceramic, ~13% higher than that of the monolithic TiC sample.",
