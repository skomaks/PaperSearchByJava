Herein, the visible-light activities of g-C3N4 nanosheets are successfully improved by co-modifying SnO2 and Ag, with ~10-time and ~8-time improvement respectively for CO2 conversion and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) degradation as compared to the pure g-C3N4.

      "text" : "Developing energy sources and overcoming environmental problems are two main noteworthy tasks for modern sciences in 21st century. Recently, fossil fuels are widely used as energy resources that including natural gas, coal and petroleum products which are about 80 % of the total energy resources. The excessive depletion of these natural energy resources results in the energy crisis along with the increase of CO2 concentration [1-3]. This brought a lot of undesirable climatic changes in atmosphere such as global warming and greenhouse effect [4, 5]. During past few years, globally CO2 concentration was estimated about 280 ppm but presently it increased up to 400 ppm which is considered one of the main reasons in global warming. In addition, the consumption of these fossil fuels also results in over release of poisonous pollutants which are harmful to the environment. Water contamination by organic pollutants originated from industrial wastes and agricultural activities is considered one of the universal environmental issues [6, 7]. Among various pollutants, chlorophenols which are originated from the industrial wastes water, greatly effect human’s health, considered as very Jo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\nstable poisonous organic pollutant hardly to degrade, especially 2,4-Dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) [8]. It is needed to be preferentially controlled due to its highly toxic and carcinogenic nature. Hence, it is highly recommended to explore and introduce advanced effective techniques to stop increasing addition of CO2 and 2,4-DCP to environment [9].\nIn the previous years, many traditional biological and electrolytic techniques have been widely\ninvestigated to solve energy crisis and environmental problems, but these techniques always suffer from many drawbacks such as electrode corrosion, lower mechanical strength and low stability. Accordingly, introducing a new advanced alternative technique is highly necessary to overcome these drawbacks [10-12]. Among various strategies applied, photocatalysis is counting an attractive and promising technique having potential to cope various type of pollutants effectively degrade in ambient condition and overcome energy crisis due to its unique properties such as low price, non-toxicity, utilizing solar energy, suitable reaction circumstances, high chemical stability and no contamination issue [13-16]. The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into hydrocarbon fuel is an effective and promising strategy and has got much attention of researchers worldwide for impeding greenhouse effect while providing suitable platform for renewable energy resources [17-19]. So far, various of semiconductor photocatalysts have been developed and are always divided into two categories, wide bandgap and narrow bandgap semiconductors. As visible-light driven photocatalysts, narrow bandgap semiconductors are considered to exhibit more potential than the wide bandgap ones. Because wide bandgap semiconductors can only utilize UV light, which is about 5 % solar light reached to earth surface [20].\nAmong many narrow bandgap semiconductors investigated, g-C3N4 as a promising 2D conjugated polymer semiconductor with weak Vander Waal force of attraction between layers, is considered as the coming generation photocatalyst owing to its tremendous physiochemical stability, cheapness, having exceptional high visible-light activity for the H2 evaluation, CO2 conversion, NOx reduction and degradation of wide range of organic pollutants, attributed to its interesting electronic band structure (suitable conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) positions) [21-26]. These advantages make it more suitable for CO2 conversion and pollutant degradation [5]. However, as polymer semiconductors always suffer from the strong interaction between electrons and holes, their photocatalytic activities are always hampered by low visible light activation, and lower specific surface area as well as the weak charge separation property [27-30]. On the other hand, lacking catalytic function also limits the activity of g-C3N4 to some extent. Hence, it is highly recommended to introduce a new advanced effective technique to accompany these disadvantages.\nMany research efforts have been put forward to promote charge separation of g-C3N4 by introducing\nJo rn\nal Pr\nepr\no f\nother wide bandgap semiconductors such as TiO2 and ZnO. Raziq et al. proved that coupling of TiO2 can successfully enhance charges separation of g-C3N4 which result in improving CO2 reduction and pollutant degradation [31]. Hatem Moussa et al. successfully enhanced charges separation of g-C3N4 and promoted visible-light performance for degradation of dyes by coupling g-C3N4 with ZnO [32]. However, the composites still lack of catalytic functions which result in the lifetime prolonged electrons could not effectively trigger reactions.\nOn the other hand, many methods have been explored to introduce catalytic functions on g-C3N4, and the most widely used one is to modify with noble metals, including Au, Pt and Ag. Li et al. successfully improve water splitting performance of g-C3N4 by modifying Pt as a co-catalyst [33]. Gao and his co-workers prove that the modification of Pd and Pt on g-C3N4 as co-catalyst can reduce its reaction barrier for CO2 reduction reaction by DFT calculations [34]. However, even though noble metals could provide catalytic function for reduction reactions and accept photogenerated electrons, but still they are not beneficial for prolonging photogenerated electrons lifetime with appropriate energy due to their low fermi level, limiting photocatalytic improvement to certain extent [35-37].\nTherefore, it is workable to simultaneously prolong lifetime of electrons with adequate energy and provide catalytic function by introducing wide bandgap semiconductor and noble metal, respectively. In addition, it is suggested that the prolonged charge lifetime and provided catalytic function can form a synergistic effect for improving activities of g-C3N4. For wide bandgap semiconductor, SnO2 is considered as better electrons acceptor compared to ZnO and TiO2, since its CB position is lower while keeping enough thermodynamic energy for the electrons [38]. For the noble metal, Ag is considered to be a good choice since its physical and chemical stabilities are outstanding amongst the noble metals, its surface catalytic properties are not affected by strong acidic and basic solutions, and its price is rather low as compared to the other noble metals (about 70-time cheaper than Au and Pt, and 50-time than Pd) [39]. Therefore, it is very necessary to prolong charge lifetime of electrons with sufficient energy as well as provide catalytic function in g-C3N4 nanosheet by co-modifying SnO2 and Ag nanoparticles, to synergistically improve photocatalytic activity.\nIn this work, g-C3N4 was successfully prepared and further co-modified with SnO2 and Ag nanoparticles. The optimized sample shows exceptional visible-light activity for reducing CO2 and degrading 2,4-DCP pollutant, with 10 and 8-time compared to pure g-C3N4. The exceptional activities are mainly due to the synergistic effect between SnO2 and Ag nanoparticles for separately enhancing charge lifetime and providing catalytic functions for g-C3N4 nanosheets. This research will offer new opportunity to construct g-C3N4 based photocatalysts with excellent visible-light activity for converting CO2 and degrading pollutant.\nJ ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of"

      "text" : "Analytical grade reagents were used directly during the experimental process and the deionized\nwater used for synthesis was deionized water.\n2.1 Synthesis of g-C3N4 nanosheet\nIn the typical experiment, 35 g of urea were put into aluminum crucible with 100 mL volume with a cover on it and calcined at 550 °C for 3h (0.5 °C/min). Then precipitates were washed with 0.2 M HNO3 for three times, then wash by water and absolute ethanol for several times. Finally keep sample for drying in oven at 80 °C for 12 h, grinded into fine power and were used for further experiments.\n2.2 Synthesis of SnO2 modified g-C3N4 nanosheet\nIn-situ microwave-assisted hydrothermal method were used to synthesized SnO2 modifying g-C3N4 samples. In the typical experimental, 3.84 mmol of CTAB (Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 1.4g), 9.6 mmol of HMT (hexamethylenetetramine, 1.34 g) and 240 mL deionized water were added into a beaker to make stock solution. Then 1g of g-C3N4 and deserved quantity of SnCl2.2H2O (2, 4, 6 and 8 percent in mole ratio) were mixed into 60 mL of the stock solution. After vigorously stirring and sonicating alternated for 10 min by 3 cycles, then mixture solution was transferred to Teflon tube (100 mL). XH-800S microwave hydrothermal reactor (made in Beijing by Xiang Hu Science and Technology Company) was used for microwave irradiation. The mixture solution temperature was raised to 93 °C in 5 min and keep for 1 h with the limit power of 700 W. After microwave irradiation process, post-reaction was removed and precipitates were centrifuged, washed three times with ethanol and water, then dried in vacuum condition for 12 h (80 °C). The prepared sample was grinded, calcined at 450 °C for 2h (10 °C/min) and labeled as xSn-CN in which the x means the percent mole ratio of SnO2 (x= 2, 4, 6 and 8) and the pure g-C3N4 was labeled as CN. The pure SnO2 was also synthesized by the same method, by adding 9.6 mmol of SnCl2.2H2O (2.16 g) into the stock solution without CN.\n2.3 Photodeposition of nanosized Ag\nPhotodeposition method was used for modifying Ag. In the typical experiment, 1g of pure CN or 6Sn-CN sample was added into the mixture solution of 100 mL distilled water and 50 mL methanol in a beaker, then deserved amount for 1 percent in mole ratio of silver nitrate (AgNO3) was added into the mixture and vigorously stirred and sonicate simultaneously for 40 min. Afterward, the mixture solution was bubble with highly pure N2 gas for 30 min and then irradiated with 300 W xenon lamp for 3 h with cutoff filter of 420 nm. Then mixture solution was centrifuged, wash precipitates with absolute ethanol and water for several times, then keep dried in oven at 80 °C for 12 h. Prepared\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro f\nsamples were calcined for 30 min at 300 °C.\n2.4 Characterization of materials\nBruker D8 advance diffractometer with CuKα radiation was applied to characterize the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) were carried out by Model Shimadzu UV2550 spectrophotometer with BaSO4 as a reference. Morphology were checked by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were carried out by JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope with acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The sample thickness was measured by Atomic force microscopy (AFM) with model number Seiko SPA 400 with a Nanonavi Probe Station dynamic force mood. Samples were pasted on commercially available silicone sheet cantilevers which are used as substrate. The photoluminance (PL) spectra of as prepared samples were analyzed by spectrofluorometer-photometer (LS55 PerkinElmer) at 390 nm excitation wavelength.\nTransient-state PL (TS-PL) responses were measured by home-built apparatus system with 1 ns pulse lamp excitation. The surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) was measured at room temperature by home-built apparatus with a xenon lamp (CHF XQ500 W). Transient-state surface photovoltage (TS-SPV) responses were tested by a home-built apparatus in open environment at room temperature by using a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet nanosecond laser (the laser model is Lab-130-10H, Newport, Co.) as the excitation light source and a high-energy pyroelectric sensor (PE50BF-DIF-C, Ophir Photonics Group) as the response recorder.\n2.5 Electrochemical reduction measurement\nElectrochemical reduction curves were measured in 3 traditional electrode system. The saturated Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt plate were used as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. 0.5 M NaClO4 was used as electrolytes in this project. To make paste, 5 mg of samples, 20 μL of 5 wt % Nafion ionomers and 0.18 mL of absolute ethanol were mixed together, vigorously stirred and sonicated simultaneously for 30 min. Take few drops of mixture solution and dropped uniformly on surface of clean FTO glass electrodes, then dried in vacuum drying oven at 80 °C for 6 h. An IVIUM V13806 was used for electrochemical analysis.\n2.6 Evaluation of photocatalytic CO2 conversion activity\nIn the typical procedure, 0.1 g of the sample was added in 5 mL of deionized water, then transferred to cylindrical steel reactor (100 mL with diameter of 3.5 cm-2). Highly pure CO2 was flowed through the reaction reactor for 20 min, keep constant for next 20 min to equilibrated, then irradiated for 4 h\nJ ur\nna l P\nr -p\nro of\nwith 300 W xenon lamp. During irradiation, 0.25 mL of gas were taken from the reaction reactor and analyzed for detection of CH4 and CO amount produced during chemical reaction by GC model number 7920 with TCD made by Au Light from Beijing.\n2.7 Evaluation of photocatalytic 2,4-DCP degradation activity\nThe as samples were also analyzed for 2,4-DCP degradation. In the typical procedure, 0.2 g of catalyst dispersed in 40 mL of 2,4-DCP solution (20 mg/L) and vigorously stirred for 30 min in dark to get absorption desorption equilibrium. Afterward, the mixture solution was irradiated by 150 W Xe lamp (GYZ220) for 1 h with 420 nm cutoff filter. After photocatalytic experiment, 5 mL of the solution was filtered and analyzed for 2,4-DCP amount degraded during photocatalytic reaction with spectrophotometer Shimadzu UV-2550.\n2.8 Evaluation of hydroxyl radical amount\nHydroxyl radicals (‧ OH) are considered very active species which play significant role in photocatalytic process. Coumarin is used to detect ‧ OH more effectively with high sensitivity. In the typical experiment, 0.05 g of the catalyst was dispersed in 50 mL of coumarin solution with concentration of 1×10-3 mol/L, and vigorously stirred in dark for 30 min to get absorption desorption equilibrium. Afterward solution was irradiated by 150 W Xenon lamp with 420 nm cutoff filter for 1 h. After irradiation, 5 mL of the aliquot was centrifuged to remove catalyst content and then transferred to Pyrex glass cell to check for hydroxyl radical amount produced with excitation wavelength at 332 nm by spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer LS55).\n3. Result and discussion\n3.1 Structural characterization\nThe as prepared samples were tested for XRD analyses (Fig. S1). From the XRD patterns one can\nsee that pure CN shows two distinctive peaks positioned at 13.1° (100) and 27.2° (002) in well\ncorrespondence to the interplanar stacking of conjugated aromatic ring and interlayer packing (JCPDS\nNo 50-0848) [40]. In addition, four other peaks are also observed positioned at 33.77 (101), 37.76\n(200), 51.75 (211) and 65.74° (301) which are assigned to SnO2, and they are in well correspondence to JCPDS No. 46-1088 [38, 41]. However, no distinctive peaks of Ag are observed in Ag/CN and\n1Ag/6Sn-CN samples which may be due to the very small amount of Ag modified on the surface of\npure CN and 6Sn-CN samples [42]. Moreover, no extra peaks are detected, indicating high purity of\nJ ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\nthe samples.\nUV-vis DRS was measured to further study optical absorption properties of the as prepared samples\nas shown in Fig. S2. From UV-vis DRS results, it clearly demonstrated that bandgap energy of CN\nremains unchanged after modifying with nanosized SnO2. However, the Ag/CN and 1Ag/6Sn-CN samples show slightly absorption in visible region due to surface plasmonic effect of Ag nanoparticles\nmodified on the surface of CN and 6Sn-CN [43, 44].\nTEM studies reveal that the SnO2 and Ag nanoparticles are successfully co-modified on the surface of CN (Fig. 1). It is confirmed that CN has nanosheet-like morphology while SnO2 and Ag are nanoparticles with diameters of 6 nm and 15 nm, respectively. The 1Ag/6Sn-CN sample shows the\ncharacteristic spacings of 0.33 nm for the (110) lattice planes of the modified SnO2 [45, 46], and 0.236 nm for the (111) lattice planes of the modified Ag [42]. The TEM results are in correspondence to\nXRD results, confirming the presence of Ag. To further evaluate the nanosheet structure and the\nthickness of pure CN and Ag/6Sn-CN, Atomic force microscopy (AFM) were performed, as shown in\nFig. S3. The AFM micrograph and corresponding height profile confirm the nanosheet structure of the\nprepared samples and the thicknesses of the CN is about 10 nm and keep unchanged after co-modifying\nwith SnO2 and Ag.\n3.2 Photogenerated charge separation property\nAs an advanced, promising, highly sensitive and widely used method, SPS was measured for\nexploring the charge separation properties of the as prepared samples. Basically, SPS signal originates\nfrom photogenerated charge separation by diffusion process, it is naturally accepted that the higher\nSPS response corresponds to the better charge separation. From the results one can see that pure CN\nshows rather low SPS response, indicating its weak charge separation (Fig. 2a and S4). However, the\nSPS response gets higher after modifying with optimized amount of SnO2 and further increases after co-modifying with Ag. These results indicate that both modifying SnO2 and Ag can enhance the charge separation of CN while the SnO2-modified one is relatively stronger, and the co-modified sample (1Ag/6Sn-CN) exhibits the strongest charge separation [46]. In order to further confirm charge\nseparation, PL analysis was measured. It is believed that the higher PL response corresponds to the\nweaker charge separation [33, 47]. From the PL spectra one can see that the PL responses are in the\norders of CN>1Ag/CN>6Sn-CN>1Ag/6Sn-CN (Fig. 2a and S5a), there is good consistence between\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\nSPS and PL results.\nTo further investigate the charge separation properties from the perspective of photochemistry, the\nproduced hydroxyl radicals (‧ OH) amount was measured by coumarin fluorescence analysis. It is widely accepted that stronger fluorescent intensity means larger number of photo-generated ‧ OH\nradicals during chemical reactions, reflecting the enhanced charge separation [48]. The fluorescence\nspectra (FS) related to the amount of produced ‧ OH were shown in Fig. 2b and S5b. It is confirmed\nthat the intensity of fluorescence response is increased after modifying SnO2 and further increased after co-modifying Ag, indicating the enhanced charge separation. Obviously, there is good\nconsistence among FS, SPS and PL results.\nFig. 2. Surface photovoltage responses (a) with the photoluminescence spectra as the inset, and fluorescence spectra related to hydroxyl radical produced (b) of pure CN, 1Ag/CN, 6Sn-CN and 1Ag/6Sn-CN samples.\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nof\n3.3 Visible-light activities for CO2 reduction and 2,4-DCP degradation\nThe as prepared sample were evaluated for visible-light activities CO2 conversion in the presence of H2O without any co-catalyst (Fig. 3a and S6a). As the main gaseous products obtained from CO2 reduction, CH4 and CO were detected to compare the activities of as prepared samples. The activities of SnO2 and Ag modified CN samples are higher than the pure CN, and the co-modified sample possesses the highest activity. The 6Sn-CN sample shows photocatalytic activity about 4-time higher than pure CN, while 1Ag/CN is about 3-time in 4 h irradiation. Interestingly, the photocatalytic activity of 1Ag/6Sn-CN is 10-time higher than pure CN which is also higher than the sum of 6Sn-CN and 1Ag/CN samples. It is confirmed based on activity result that there is a synergistic effect between comodified SnO2 and Ag in improving visible-light activity CO2 conversion of CN.\nIn addition to CO2 reduction, 2,4-DCP degradation activities of samples were also checked for further comparing their activities (Fig. 3b and S6b). The activity of CN is improved after modifying SnO2 and Ag, while the co-modified sample also shows the highest activity for 2,4-DCP degradation. The photoactivities of 6Sn-CN and 1Ag/CN samples are about 4-time and 3-time higher than pure CN, respectively. Moreover, the synergistic effect between co-modified SnO2 and Ag has also been observed in improving the photocatalytic 2,4-DCP degradation of CN, as the activity of 1Ag/6Sn-CN sample is 8-time that of pure CN, which is also higher than the sum of 6Sn-CN and 1Ag/CN samples.\n3.4 Mechanism discussion\nIt is confirmed from the above results that modified SnO2 and Ag play active role in improving photocatalytic CO2 reduction and 2,4-DCP degradation activities of CN. In order to further understand the conclusions, various experiments about mechanistic study were performed. From the perspective of charge transfer and charge separation, TS-SPV analyses of CN, 1Ag/CN, 6Sn-CN and 1Ag/6Sn-CN samples were performed (Fig. 4a). Electrons and holes are generated in the material after photoexcitation, then diffuse to the surfaces. Electrons are captured by oxygen, then provide a surface photovoltage response. The TS-SPV signals exhibit two main parameters, the intensity and the calculated lifetime which reflect the charge separation intensity and charge carriers’ lifetime, respectively. Firstly, from the comparison of TS-SPV intensities one can see that the charge separation intensities are in the orders of 1Ag/6Sn-CN>6Sn-CN>1Ag/CN>CN, well matched to SPS result, further supporting the charge separation results. Moreover, from the analysis of charge carriers’ dynamic process, it is shown that the spatially dependent charge recombination between electrons and holes of all samples in good matching to an exponential function, indicating they obey the logarithm rules [36, 49]. Based on the fitted time constant, one can see that the charge carriers’ lifetime of CN Jo ur na l P\nre -p\nro of\n(0.53 ms) is prolonged by modifying SnO2 (1.11 ms) and Ag (0.92 ms), while the co-modified sample exhibits the longest charge lifetime (1.76 ms). The prolonged charge lifetime is favorable for the enhanced charge separation.\nFor further exploring the inside mechanism of how charge separation is promoted and how charge lifetime is prolonged by modifying SnO2 and Ag, PL lifetimes were also conducted by TS-PL measurement (Fig. 4b and Table S1). The shortened PL lifetime means that there is an added decay channel to the photo-excited charge transfer from CN [50-52]. Based on normalized TS-PL result of CN, 1Ag/CN, 6Sn-CN and 1Ag/6Sn-CN samples, it is concluded that decay life of CN is shortened by co-modifying SnO2 and Ag. Among modified samples, Ag/6Sn-CN is more favorable. This confirmed that the photogenerated electrons are transferred from CN to SnO2 and Ag, resulting in prolonged charge carrier lifetime [36].\nFig. 4. Transient-state surface photovoltage responses (a) and transient-state photoluminescence spectra (b) of pure CN, 1Ag/CN, 6Sn-CN and 1Ag/6Sn-CN samples.\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro\nOn the other hand, the introduction of noble metals is always accompanied with catalytic functions which is beneficial for photocatalytic reactions. Electrochemical tests (EC) of CN, 6Sn-CN, Ag/CN and 1Ag/6Sn-CN samples were performed in different conditions, including CO2-, O2- and N2-bubbled system to further investigate the catalytic ability of modified Ag (Fig. 5 and S7). From the EC results one can see that it is more suitable for the modified samples to catalyze CO2 reduction reaction [1,53]. Moreover, different from the charge separation results, the Ag modified CN sample exhibits stronger catalytic property as compared to the SnO2 modified one. Furthermore, from the comparison of the EC results for CO2 and N2, one can see that it is much beneficial for the samples to reduce CO2 than water due to the lower overpotential of EC CO2 reduction reaction [54]. In addition, similar EC results were also observed in the presence of O2, confirming the stronger catalytic ability of modified Ag in the photocatalytic 2,4-DCP degradation reaction.\nIt is concluded from these results that the main function of modified SnO2 is to prolong the charge lifetime of CN as it can provide better platform for the transferred electrons, while the main effect of modified Ag is to provide catalytic functions for the photocatalytic reactions. In order to further investigate if this strategy is applicable to other noble metals, similar experiments about Au modification were also performed. From the XRD patterns we confirm that SnO2 and Au were successfully modified on surface of CN as shown in Fig. S8a. Based on the SPS, PL and ‧ OH analyses (Fig. S8b and S8c), it is concluded that the charge separation can be successfully enhanced by modifying SnO2 and Au, while the effect of SnO2 is much stronger. The EC results for CO2- and N2systems are shown in Fig. S8d and S8e, it is noticed that the Au modified CN sample exhibits stronger catalytic property as compared to the SnO2 modified one. These results are well consistent with those of the Ag modified samples, signifying that the strategy of modifying SnO2 to enhance charge separation and modifying noble metal to provide catalytic function has a certain degree of universality.\nFig. 5. Electrochemical I-V curves in the CO2-bubbled (a) and O2-bubbled systems of pure CN, 1Ag/CN, 6Sn-CN and 1Ag/6Sn-CN samples.\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro f\nBased on the above results and discussions, a schematic mechanism was proposed to well describe the mechanism (Fig. 6). Visible-light irradiated on the surface of CN to generate electron-hole pairs, electrons transfer to the CB of SnO2 so that the recombination between electrons and holes will be suppressed by this process, which results into the prolonged charge lifetime. This is favorable for both holes and electrons to participate in the photocatalytic reactions. Subsequently, the lifetime-prolonged electrons transfer to modified Ag and participate in the photocatalytic reduction reactions with the catalytic function of modified Ag, while the holes will trigger oxidation reactions simultaneously.\nFig. 6. Schematic on the mechanism of transfer and separation of photogenerated charges of 1Ag/6SnCN and the induced photochemical reactions."

Herein, the visible-light activities of g-C3N4 nanosheets are successfully improved by co-modifying SnO2 and Ag, with ~10-time and ~8-time improvement respectively for CO2 conversion and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) degradation as compared to the pure g-C3N4. Mainly based on the transient-state surface photovoltage responses, transient-state photoluminescence spectra and electrochemical analyses, it is confirmed that the improved photoactivities are attributed to the synergistic effect of the prolonged charge lifetime and the provided catalytic function by modifying SnO2 and Ag, respectively. In addition, the synergistic effect is also feasible by replacing Ag with Au. This work will provide an effective strategy for designing high-activity g-C3N4 based photocatalysts.",
