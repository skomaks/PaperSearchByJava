      "text" : "The wetting behaviour is a key property of a porous medium that controls hydraulic conductivity in multiphase flow. While many porous materials, such as hydrocarbon reservoir rocks, are initially wetted by the aqueous phase, surface active components within the nonwetting phase can alter the wetting state of the solid. Close to the saturation endpoints wetting phase fluid films of nanometre thickness impact the wetting alteration process. The properties of these films depend on the chemical characteristics of the system. Here we demonstrate that surface texture can be equally important and introduce a novel workflow to characterize the wetting state of a porous medium."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Wetting describes the preference of a solid phase to be in contact with one fluid rather than another. In porous media, where the surface area of the solid phase is large, wetting is one of the controlling factors for two-phase flow, which plays a role in applications such as ink-jet printing, construction, soil infiltration, environmental remediation and oil recovery [1-9]. In an oil reservoir, which includes crude oil, brine and rock (COBR-system), a rock surface is called water-wet when the brine tends to cover it and is called oil-wet when it prefers to be in contact with the oil phase. The wetting of a rock may also vary from location to location. In this case the rock is called mixed-wet [10-15]. The flow behaviour in porous media is commonly characterised by capillary pressuresaturation- functions and relative permeability- saturation functions. So far these functions can only be determined through costly and time intense Darcy (core) -scale experiments (e.g. flooding). Pore-scale computational models and simulation approaches struggle for various reasons. Computational performance is one aspect, but more conceptually, it is currently not fully understood how to effectively characterize wetting behaviour of rock and assign a representative spatial distribution at the pore-network scale, on which basis a meaningful average could be computed to obtain a Darcy-level response. As a consequence, the exact relationship between wetting and the Darcy-scale response is not very well understood, in particular the impact of the spatial wetting distribution. The Darcy-scale wetting response is commonly characterized by indices derived from capillary pressure-saturation- functions, which are obtained by measuring the capillary pressure required to change the saturation within the porous medium [16-19]. The fluid phase which imbibes the sample spontaneously is thereby considered the more wetting phase [16, 20]. However, wetting itself is a molecular scale property, determined by the molecular interactions of the three phases present. In order to upscale wetting, further parameters occurring at larger length scales need to be considered. One of these is the structural variation of the porous medium, which is dominant in chemically homogeneous carbonates forming 60% of the worldwide oil reservoirs. In addition to the general pore-geometry, surface roughness, which may for instance originate from the microporosity, may also influence the response [21-24]. However, so far, studies focussing on the impact of surface roughness on flow in permeable media, are either conceptual or demonstrate experimentally a relationship, but are missing the direct link allowing the upscaling of molecular characteristics to pore- and core-scale responses [24-31]. In this work, we assess the impact of the surface structure of natural rock on the core-scale wetting response by investigating the fluid distribution at different length scales and introduce a systematic workflow linking molecular phenomena with pore- and core-scale responses.\n4 1.1 Wetting from the molecular scale to fluid films Only a few minerals, such as graphite or talc are naturally hydrophobic [32, 33]. Most minerals present in reservoir rock are originally strongly water-wet [34-36]. However, the wetting of a surface may be altered towards more oil-wet by precipitation and/or adsorption of surface-active components present in the crude [37-40]. Carbonate rock tends to become more oil-wet than sandstone, which is often attributed to the positive surface charge of calcite at reservoir conditions [15, 34, 41, 42]. The interactions between different oil-components and the rock surface can be studied for instance with atomic force microscopy (AFM), in which the force required to pull off a probe of nano-scale size (radius r = 10-50nm), the adhesion force, is measured [35, 43]. In addition to the chemistry of the crude oil and the surface chemistry of the rock, the brine composition also impacts wetting [44, 45]. On a mineral surface covered with brine, the balance between electrostatic forces and van der Waals forces leads to a double layer of counterions in correspondence with Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO theory; [46, 47] ), which impacts the repulsive/attractive forces of approaching oil-molecules [48, 49]. In combination with structural forces of the fluid/fluid interface these lead to a disjoining pressure given by:\uD835\uDEB7 I. ,\uD835\uDEB7(\uD835\uDC21) = ― \uD835\uDEC5(\uD835\uDC7E\uD835\uDC7D\uD835\uDC6B\uD835\uDC7E + \uD835\uDC7E\uD835\uDC86\uD835\uDC8D + \uD835\uDC7E\uD835\uDC94\uD835\uDC95) \uD835\uDEC5\uD835\uDC89 with the work related to van der Waals forces , electrostatic forces and structural \uD835\uDC4A\uD835\uDC49\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC4A \uD835\uDC4A\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC59 forces , and thickness of the water film [48, 50]. \uD835\uDC4A\uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC61 δℎ The Van der Waals force is usually attractive and correspondingly, contributes to a negative capillary pressure and destabilization of the water film. The structural force is always repulsive, contributing to positive disjoining pressure which stabilizes a water film. However, electrostatic forces, which can be assessed with ζ-potential measurements, can have a negative or positive contribution to disjoining pressure [27, 51]. If the surface charges of the rock surface and the fluid-fluid interface are attractive, the water film is unstable and the overall disjoining pressure remains negative as illustrated by the dotted disjoining pressure – film thickness function shown in Figure 1B. For repulsive surface charges, the positive contribution of the electrostatic forces to the disjoining pressure, illustrated by the dashed line in Figure 1B, causes a stabilization of the water film. The film ruptures if the maximum disjoining pressure is exceeded [27]. Only if the water film ruptures, the non-wetting Π\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65 phase can come in contact with the solid and allow the wetting of the surface to be altered [31]. In a mixed-wet system, the disjoining pressure must have been exceeded in some locations, but not in all [14, 40]. Chemical heterogeneity may be one reason for variation in disjoining pressure [31]. However, carbonate rocks are dominated by calcite or dolomite, which makes them mostly chemically homogeneous. Mineral variation is therefore unlikely to be generally responsible for the wetting variation in this rock. Correspondingly, the structure of the rock, given by the pore geometry and surface roughness, is controlling the mixed-wet behaviour, which is commonly assessed at the core-scale. 1.2 Wetting from the core- to the pore scale Within the confined space of porous media wetting is reflected by the term capillary pressure, Pc given by the Young-Laplace equation: II. ,\uD835\uDC77\uD835\uDC84 = \uD835\uDC77\uD835\uDC90 ― \uD835\uDC77\uD835\uDC83 = \uD835\uDED4\uD835\uDC90\uD835\uDC83\uD835\uDECB\n5 with and being the pressure of the oil and brine phases respectively, the interfacial \uD835\uDC77\uD835\uDC90 \uD835\uDC77\uD835\uDC83 \uD835\uDED4\uD835\uDC90\uD835\uDC83 tension between oil and brine and the total curvature of the oil-brine interface. For static \uD835\uDECB conditions this equation can be rephrased to: III. .\uD835\uDC77\uD835\uDC84 = \uD835\uDFD0\uD835\uDED4\uD835\uDC90\uD835\uDC83\uD835\uDC1C\uD835\uDC28\uD835\uDC2C (Ѳ) \uD835\uDC93 with being the contact angle between the oil, brine and rock surfaces measured Ѳ perpendicular to the three-phase contact line through the denser phase and r the radius of the pore. In conventional Darcy-scale experiments, the capillary pressure is reported as a function of saturation. Down to a capillary pressure of zero the capillary pressure -saturation relationship is derived from the Amott spontaneous imbibition test in which the cumulative production versus time is recorded. The forced part at can be obtained from waterfloods. Various \uD835\uDC77\uD835\uDC84 < \uD835\uDFCE indices have been introduced to characterize wetting based on the capillary pressure saturation relationship from which the Amott and USBM (U.S. Bureau of Mines) indices are the most common [16, 19]. However, the results of such experiments are difficult to interpret as other factors besides wetting may impact the results. These factors include e.g. viscosity, interfacial tension and flow dynamics. Various scaling groups have been introduced to achieve a better comparison. Yet, these have only been proven effective for systems with a homogeneous wetting [52]. In recent years micro-computed tomographic imaging (µCT) techniques have been developed to complement core-scale experiments [53-67]. The in-situ visualization of the fluid phases allows the characterisation of the fluid distribution within the rock through the integral geometry and a set of morphological descriptors, the 4 Minkowski functionals [68]. The 4 Minkowski functionals include volume, surface area, curvature and topology (Euler characteristic) of the fluid phases. Based on Hadwiger’s completeness theorem the 4 Minkowski functionals of any global morphology show a unique combination and form the only motion-invariant, conditional continuous and additive functional of this structure [69]. Describing a structure using Minkowski functionals simplifies the study of the relationship between structure and various properties, such as the energy of interfaces [70, 71] or permeability of a porous medium [72, 73], and also describes changes in structure, such as the change in fluid distribution during multiphase flow in rocks. Various studies targeted the relationship of fluid distributions occurring during two-phase flow to the pore-scale rock structure, to each other and to wetting [74-81] using the 4 Minkowski functionals and some studied the relationship between these parameters and core-scale properties like relative permeability - and capillary pressure – saturation relationships [56, 66, 76, 82-86]. While these parameters were found to be key to upscale the flow-behaviour observed at the porescale to the core-scale, the link between the molecular wetting property and the fluid distributions occurring during two-phase flow and the corresponding Minkowski functionals remains unknown. Another way to characterize the wetting of a rock is through in-situ contact angle measurements [57, 86-89]. However, the contact angle values obtained do not deliver one single index for wetting, but a distribution of contact angles with one or multiple peaks. Even in homogeneous-wet systems, surface roughness can cause contact angle hysteresis, which leads to a range of different contact angles [90]. In a model system with controlled roughness and flow this effect can be described through an advancing and a receding contact angle [91, 92]. In-situ in rock, in which surface structure may vary from location to location and in which the flow dynamics during and prior to the data acquisition at the pore level are unknown, the contact angle measured may show any value in between the advancing and a\n6\n7 surfaces are covered with oil and with water (C-centre). After ageing these surfaces remain oil-wet, even when the oil present is replaced by brine (C-right). Depending on the disjoining pressure - film thickness relationship, the fluid may be maintained up to the point is reached (Figure 1B, dashed line). Correspondingly, the \uD835\uDEB7\uD835\uDC26\uD835\uDC1A\uD835\uDC31 films along protrusions become thinner and thicker in indentations as a variation of different local capillary pressures is observed [31].\uD835\uDC77\uD835\uDC8D\uD835\uDC90\uD835\uDC84\uD835\uDC82\uD835\uDC8D\uD835\uDC84 As the film ruptures at the point at which is reached, the film would break, where the \uD835\uDEB7\uD835\uDC26\uD835\uDC1A\uD835\uDC31 curvature of the rock surface approached by the oil interface is highest and consecutively alter the wetting where in contact (Figure 1). Commonly, only the grain sizes and the corresponding pore shapes are considered when the wetting pattern is simulated [30]. However, features along the grain that determine the surface roughness are likely to cause a much larger curvature variation than the grain shapes by themselves. Also, as Kovscek et al. [31] highlighted, the surface structure of rock would be of relevance for the wetting pattern observed if the protrusion length scale of asperities is much larger than the film thickness. In the presented study we investigated the molecular interactions of the COBR system and the surface structure of a rock, analysed its impact on the nano-scale integral geometry of the oil phase and linked the results to core-scale behaviour. More specifically, we investigate the wetting behaviour we have observed in µCT experiments on core-scale samples based on the rock structure/pore geometry and compare that to what wetting behaviour is expected when including the surface structure on the grains measured by AFM. Our main goal is to describe to what extent the overall wettability state is determined by fluid occupancy of the nanoscale roughness or by fluid occupancy of the micrometer scale pore geometry. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Fluids and rock samples Ketton rock, quarried from the Ketton quarry in Rutland, England, is a middle Jurassic oolithic carbonate rock consisting of round grains (Ooids and peloids) ranging from 100 µm – 1 mm size which again contain an additional micro-porosity. Oolites are marine sediments, which form during evaporation of the sea. The dissolved carbonate in the seawater starts to precipitate along nuclei. Concentric growth and continues movement of the particles before deposition leads to the round shape of the grains [95]. Correspondingly the investigated surfaces within the rock may contain both, facets resulting from the initial growth and facets resulting from mechanical or chemical modifications afterwards. The rock history implies a homogeneous structure of the rock within the coring range of the samples obtained for this study (40 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm). The pore size distribution of Ketton rock was assessed with Hg-porosimetry. The rock has a porosity of φ = 23% and permeability of 3 – 6 D. It consists predominantly of calcite (99,1%) with minor quartz (0.9%) components [96]. We assume a relative permittivity of 7, typical for carbonates [51]. While the rock is chemically homogeneous, the structure of rock can be considered complex, though typical for carbonates, because of the dual-porosity [95]. The crude oil was chosen based on its high wetting alteration potential, which was assessed by the total acid number (TAN) and the total base number (TBN) as well as by a SARA analysis. The results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. The crude oil is rich in surface-active components as well as asphaltenes, which represent the components which are expected to change the wetting of the rock since they have the capacity to absorb on to the rock surface. For the CT measurements, the crude oil was doped with 20% - iododecane, which caused the crude oil to appear in µCT within the same range of grey values as rock. This mixture results in the highest contrast between the two fluids (brine and oil), while the attenuation\n8\nremains on the level of the rock. The brine composition used in this study is listed in Table 3. The formation water recipe is typical to a carbonate reservoir [97].\nTable 1: Basic properties of the crude oil used in this study.\nOil TAN [mg KOH g-1] TBN [mg kg-1] Relative permittivity Viscosity 20 °C [mPa s] Density 20 °C [g cm-3] crude oil 0.4 2.9 2 17 0.85\nTable 2: SARA fractions for the crude oil used in this work displayed in the relative weight of each compound class.\nOil Saturates [wt %] Aromatics [wt %] Resins [wt %] Asphaltenes [wt %] crude oil 52.08 39.06 7.96 0.91\nTable 3: Composition of formation water (FW) used in this work.\nIon Na+ Mg2 + Ca2+ Cl- SO4 2- HCO3- Relative permittivity Ionic strength [mol/l] pH [mg/l] 49898 3248 14501 111812 234 162 78.3 3.659 5.7 The interfacial tension between the doped oil and brine was = 20 mN/m at 25˚C.σ\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC4F 2.1 Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) The surface structure of Ketton rock was assessed with AFM. In contrast to traditional microscopes, which create a magnified image by focusing electromagnetic radiation, such as photons or electrons. AFM images mechanically. An atomically sharp tip attached to the end of a cantilever is raster-scanned over a surface. The tip interacts with the underlying surface through various intermolecular forces. These forces lead to a bending of the cantilever, which is monitored by a laser, as illustrated in Figure 2. This technique allows a very precise 3D visualization of the topography of a surface and also the detection of various physical properties.\nFigure 2 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to image the rock surface as it occurs within a pore (A). Atomic force microscopy operates with an atomically sharp tip, which is mounted on a cantilever and monitored by a laser. As the tip approaches and disengages the surface, the tip starts to interact with it causing a bending of the cantilever. The force-\n9 distance curves generated from the approach (trace) and disengaging processes (retrace) at each point scanned along the surface can then be used to visualize the surface topography and to determine other properties of the surface such as stiffness and adhesion (B) [98].\n10\nIn this study we used AFM (Nanowizard 4, JPK Instruments, now Brucker) to image the structure of the rock surface down to nanometer resolution. The measurements were conducted in approachable pores at the outer space of the Ketton sample not affected by drilling. The sample was scanned with a silicon tip (PPP-NCHAuD from NANOSENSORSTM) on 50 µm x 50 µm area with a resolution of 512 x 512 pixel in Quantitative ImagingTM -mode. The image was levelled, filtered using a median filter, analysed for curvature and roughness and visualized with JPKSPM data processing software (JPK instruments) and then transformed into a 3D image with a voxel size of 0.097 µm using MATLAB (R2018b). This image was then further processed with AVIZO (ThermoFisher) for visualization of the curvature and GeoDICT 2015 (Math2Market, Kaiserslautern, Germany) to perform a drainage simulation and for visualization of the fluid films.\n2.2 ζ-potential measurements\nThe presented ζ-potential measurements were carried out with a Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern Instruments), which detects the electrophoretic mobility of particles within a suspension or oil droplets dispersed in the studied brine. The ζ-potential is then derived from the electrophoretic mobility using the Smoluchowski approximation of Henry’s equation [99]. The rock was first ground and then mixed with brine following the protocols described in Zhang and Austad [100] and the oil-brine emulsion was prepared following the protocols described in Mahani et al. [51]. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for one day before any measurements were taken. The measurements were performed at 25 ˚C at a pH of 5.7, corresponding to the brine pH used in the core experiments. The results were used to calculate disjoining pressure – film thickness relationships following the procedure described in Mahani et al. [51].\n2.3 Amott test\nAmott spontaneous imbibition tests are simple experiments conducted at the core scale, which are often used for wetting determination [16, 101]. In this test, an oil-saturated rock sample is placed into a vessel containing brine. In water-wet and mixed-wet samples the water spontaneously imbibes into the rock sample replacing the oil, which then gets produced. In an Amott vessel the produced oil is collected and monitored over time. The production rate and the overall production are used as a measure for wetting [102].\n2.3.1 Sample initialization centrifuge\nThe Ketton rock sample (special core analysis (SCAL)-plug: diameter d = 2.5 cm and length L = 5 cm) was first saturated with brine (FW) and then desaturated with crude oil in a centrifuge (URC-628, 129 Coretest Systems Inc., used at 3500 RPM) for 24 hours to reach initial water saturation Scw. To counter the gradual heating during centrifugation, the temperature was kept constant at 40 ˚C with a heating element coupled with a temperature controller within the centrifuge chamber. During the experiment the production was continuously monitored. In addition, the sample was scanned using HECTOR a high energy µCT scanner at UGCT to visualize the fluid distribution within the sample. The voxel size achieved was 14.25 µm. A more detailed description of scanning settings and image processing can be found in Bartels et al. [88]\n2.3.2 Sample initialization flow cell\nThe other Ketton rock sample (Mini-plug: diameter d = 4 mm and length L = 20 mm) was\n11\nsaturated with brine and desaturated by flooding oil with a flow rate of 1 mL/min (7.7 PV/min) for 193 PV (pore volume). The sample was scanned prior and after flooding with the Environmental µCT scanner (EMCT) at UGCT [103] with a voxel size of with 6.7 µm to assess the fluid distribution. Subsequently, the sample was placed into an oven at 40 ˚C for 24 h to mimic the same conditions as the SCAL plug. Due to the small volume of the sample, it was placed into the Amott cell without rolling it over a tissue. The production was again monitored using the Environmental µCT scanner with a voxel size of 13 µm. More details of the scanning settings and image processing can be found in Bartels et al. [88]."

      "text" : "12\nDuring initialization by flooding, the capillary pressure is controlled by the flow rate and the rock structure itself and therefore cannot be determined easily [94]. However, as illustrated in Figure 4C, the oil is distributed homogeneously in the resolved large pore bodies and narrow pore throats, too. The few locations in which water remains trapped are likely related to flow dynamics. Correspondingly, the capillary pressure in the rock needs to be sufficient to fill all pores above, or close to, the resolution (voxel length: 6.7 µm).\nFigure 4: (A) shows the pore size distribution of Ketton rock in unite pore volume (Vp) and includes an indication which pores are expected to be filled respectively by centrifugation and flooding (adapted from [88]). (B) shows a cross-sectional µCT image of the centrifuged sample (pixel length: 13 µm) and (C) the image of the sample initialized by flooding (pixel length: 6 µm). Both samples show a homogeneous distribution of the oil phase with only little trapped water.\nFigure 4A illustrates the range of pore-sizes which would be filled by centrifugation and the upper limit estimation for the sample initialized by flooding respectively. It becomes apparent that the two initialization methods would only cause minor differences in saturation. Therefore, the occupation of a pore by oil cannot be solely responsible for the wetting response observed at the core scale. Rücker et al. [105] hypothesized, that sub-resolution wetting patterns related to surface roughness may cause the water-wet appearance. AlRaoush [106] confirmed a relationship between surface roughness and wetting within a different rock. However, the resolution of µCT is not sufficient to fully characterize the surface structure of the grains. In the following section, we, therefore, assess the impact of surface structure of the grains with AFM.\n3.2 Surface roughness, disjoining pressure and capillary pressure\nFigure 5 shows the surface topography of a Ketton sample measured with AFM. The surface of Ketton is dominated by crystalline facets. The surface roughness, which was determined by the deviation of the measured surface from a quadratic fit mimicking the spherical shape of a Ketton grain, showed a symmetric distribution. Similar distributions were obtained at different locations in the same block in previous studies [98]. Based on this observation and due to the homogeneous nature of the rock, this surface is considered representative for the block. The average roughness of the surface was Ra = 1 µm, the root mean squared roughness of Rq = 1.3 µm and peak-to-valley roughness of Rt = 9.8 µm. This indicated that the roughness is higher than the size of fluid films, which for similar COBR systems was reported to be in the range from 1-150 nm [98, 107]. Consequently, the roughness needs to be considered for the determination of the wetting state of the system [31]. However, these roughness indices tell little about the relationship of the surface structure to wetting.\n13\nFigure 5: The surface topology of Ketton rock is dominated by crystal facies of different orientations (A). The crystalline structure causes a height variation of up to 9.8 µm, with an average roughness of Ra = 1 µm.\nMore important than the actual roughness is the surface-oil contact at the drainage endpoint, as the rock surface -oil contact determines the location of wetting alteration [31]. As described above, the surface coverage will depend on the relationship between the global capillary pressure applied and the disjoining pressure Π. Based on the augmented Young \uD835\uDC43 ∗\uD835\uDC50 Laplace equation (IV), the water films break if the local capillary pressure , which \uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC50 depends on the local curvature of the surface , exceeds the disjoining pressure . Figure κ Π\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65 6 shows the curvature of the rock surface (A) and the curvature distribution (B). The fluid films at the tips of the surface are highly convex ( < 0 µm-1), while the valleys are highly κ concave ( > 0 µm-1). Correspondingly, the fluid films would break first at the tips of the κ rock surface, while the valleys preserve the fluid films.\nFigure 6: A shows the curvature of the rock surface and B the associated curvature distribution. The crystal structures show a curvature of -5 µm-1 at their peaks, which corresponds to - σob κ = 100 kPa. The COBR-system must show a maximum disjoining pressure smaller than this value to get a surface oil contact in the rock. The global capillary pressure film \uD835\uDEF1\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65 thickness relationships plotted for locations of different curvatures ( = 1 µm-1, = 0 µm-1, = -1 µm-1) illustrates how the \uD835\uDF05 \uD835\uDF05 \uD835\uDF05 fluid film would be affected by curvature for the studied COBR system (C). The plot for = 0 µm-1, corresponds to the \uD835\uDF05 disjoining pressure – film thickness-relationship for the COBR-system as =0.\uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC50\nThe disjoining pressure is COBR system dependent. For the disjoining pressure to be able to stabilize the film along a tip with a curvature of = -5 µm-1 for a range of global capillary κ pressure applied being < , the maximum disjoining pressure must \uD835\uDC43 ∗\uD835\uDC50 σ\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC4Fκ\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B + Π\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65 Π\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65 exceed 100 kPa. Other studies reported maximum disjoining pressures ranging from 30 Π\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65 kPa to negative values [50, 51]. Figure 6C ( = 0 kPa) displays the disjoining pressure - \uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC50 film thickness relationship, which was derived from ζ-measurements for the COBR system used in this study. The results show a negative disjoining pressure for all film thickness, which is in line with observations reported for various carbonates using similar crude oil and\n14\nbrine compositions [51]. The - film thickness relationships plotted for = 20 kPa, \uD835\uDC43 ∗\uD835\uDC50 \uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC50 which corresponds to the valleys with a curvature of = 1 µm-1 along the rock surface, and κ = -20 kPa, which correspond to asperities with a curvature of = -1 µm-1 illustrate how \uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC50 κ the fluid film would be affected by a variation in capillary pressure. The films are unstable at any location the surface shows a curvature < 0 µm-1. Only in asperities with a curvature κ κ > 0 µm-1, the fluid films remain maintained. For the COBR system investigated, the water films remain stable if < , which \uD835\uDC43 ∗\uD835\uDC50 σ\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC4Fκ\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B means, that for estimations of surface area coverage, disjoining pressure can be neglected. Consequently, the surface area coverage by the wetting fluid can be estimated with the Young Laplace equation III and simulated with a sphere fitting algorithm based drainage simulation provided by GeoDICT [108]. The algorithm fits spheres of different radii, representing different capillary pressures, into the system. Thereby it considers the connectivity of the imbibing and the drained fluid, as trapped fluid cannot move. In this study we used the topographical image obtained with AFM as input defining the rock structure. For the studied system a water-wet contact angle of 30˚ was assumed. Figure 7 illustrates the surface coverage of the rock (brown) by brine (blue) for different capillary pressures. At low capillary pressure little rock surface is exposed to oil, but as the capillary pressure increases, the coverage of the rock surface increases. The rock surface exposed to oil appears patchy and disconnected, while the water forms connected streamlines through the valleys. As the capillary pressure increases, the water \uD835\uDC43 ∗\uD835\uDC50 gets drained through the water layers in the valleys of the surface structure (corner flow) down to 100% coverage with oil.\nFigure 7: Surface area coverage by brine (blue) and oil (transparent) along the rock surface (brown) for increasing capillary pressure (A: 7 kPa, B: 10 kPa, C: 14 kPa, D: 24 kPa, E: 71 kPa, ) modelled with the sphere fitting algorithm from GeoDICT.\nThe resulting wetting pattern, which would be established after ageing would lead to pinning of the fluid-fluid interface as it moves along the surface and therefore impacts pore-scale flow regimes [105]. Figure 8 puts the surface coverage, capillary pressure and the saturation in relation to each other. Combined with the topology of this system these values represent the 4 Minkowski functionals. At this length scale, however, the field of view is much smaller than a pore which away from the rock surface is occupied solely by oil, resulting in a Euler characteristic for the oil phase of 1. Figure 8A displays the capillary pressure -saturation function obtained from MICP and Figure 8B the capillary pressure -surface coverage function derived from the simulation. For the same capillary pressure range in which a change of 90% in surface coverage by oil was detected, only a minor change in saturation was obtained.\n15\nYet, only the rock surface in direct contact with the oil is expected to alter its wetting state. So even though the saturation does not change significantly, the difference in capillary pressure indicates a significant shift from water-wet to oil-wet. The dotted line represents the range of drainage capillary pressures at which the core scale samples were aged (Section 3.1, Figure 4). The capillary pressure- saturation relationship, indicates only small differences in saturation and common models considering solely pore sizes and shapes would predict a similar wetting response at the core scale [30]. However, the capillary pressure - surface area coverage relationship illustrates that in the same capillary pressure range, surface area coverage ranges from almost 100% oil to up to 90% water contact. As the oil-rock contact determines, where and how much of the rock surface gets altered, this relationship needs to be considered when linking molecular scale wetting properties with core-scale investigations. From a conceptual perspective, this finding is key to link molecular wetting with the fluiddistributions observed during two-phase flow at larger scales. As the fluid distribution is considered to control the wetting alteration processes, all 4 Minkowski functionals after drainage need to be determined. The volume is given through the saturation, curvature through capillary pressure and the connectivity (Euler characteristic) is not expected to change when considering surface roughness. Correspondingly surface area or surface area coverage is the missing parameter. This study demonstrates that the impact of the nano-scale surface roughness controls the wettability distributions along the rock surface. Furthermore, it connects the nano-scale wetting state to the perceived core-scale wetting. In order to predict the wetting response at the core-scale, the relationship between capillary pressure, saturation and surface area coverage needs to be investigated. Atomic force microscopy allows us to obtain the necessary resolution when µCT resolution is insufficient."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusion",
      "text" : "The results obtained at the core- and nano-scale show that the core-scale wetting response of the system strongly depends on surface area coverage by oil controlled by the surface structure of the grain surfaces and the capillary pressure applied during initialization. This relationship was conceptually discussed in many previous studies [26-31] and indicatively supported by pore- and Darcy-scale flow experiments [25, 26]. However, though\n16\nconceptually understood so far, a direct link to upscale molecular scale characteristics to flow behaviour in porous media attributing for surface properties such as roughness remained missing. With this paper, we introduced a novel systematic workflow to characterize the relevant surface attributes and demonstrated that the effect of roughness can be assessed through surface coverage - capillary pressure relationships. In this study, we presented two core-scale experiments with the same crude oil, brine rock system, in which when high capillary pressure was applied, the rock sample appeared oil-wet but was water-wet for low capillary pressure initialization. The pore-occupancy by oil after drainage resolved by µCT was almost the same. The dependence of the wetting response on the surface structure of Ketton rock was assessed with atomic force microscopy, ζ-potential measurements and a static drainage simulation. The results demonstrate that surface coverage by oil varies from >80 % even though the change in saturation is minor. Considering that the surface – oil contact is controlling the wetting alteration processes, we concluded that surface area coverage variation is responsible for the change in the core-scale wetting response. Moving forward, the relationship between capillary pressure and surface area coverage needs to be considered next to the chemical interactions within the fluid/fluid/solid system for the development of predictive capability about wetting alteration. Complemented by mercury intrusion capillary pressure - saturation data and the Euler characteristic which can be derived from µCT images of the core, these descriptors would give the full set of Minkowskifunctionals necessary to describe the 3D distribution of the oil-phase during wetting alteration."
