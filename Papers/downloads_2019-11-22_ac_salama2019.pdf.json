Recently, cellulose and inorganics are synergistically coupled to tailor promising functional hybridswith unique properties. The current reviewpresents an overview of the recent trials for preparing cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrid materials and offers prospects for many new applications in diverse fields. During the whole review, different cellulose forms and cellulose derivatives are being explored as fillers or templates for the design of new functional materials and support for the loading of different calcium phosphate phases. The functionalization of cellulose with calcium phosphate was carried out to construct new and attractive physicochemical properties that are being exploited for different applications such as bone regeneration, drug delivery vehicles, dental repair and adsorption. The studying of cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrid materials is supported by increasing concern in providing smart materials that combine best of the calcium phosphate properties along with cellulose. The review also aims to study the driving forces and limitations towards structuring of cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrid materials. It appears that the use of cellulosic materials for constructing new hybrids is very promising for biomedical and environmental applications.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nOrganic/inorganic hybrid materials have gained great interest for biomedical and environmental applications due to their exciting chemical, physical, and biological properties [1–3]. Polysaccharides have recently developed as sustainable polymers for preparing various hybrid materials in biomedical applications [4–9]. Polysaccharides are extensively investigated in biomedical applications owing to their remarkable physicochemical properties, abundance, structure diversity and low cost. Chemically, polysaccharides may be composed of a single kind of monosaccharides or two ormore differentmonomeric units and can acquire positive or negative charges through functionalization. The charged groups are useful for building networks, increasing the bioactivity and to adsorb different organic and inorganic species [10,11]. This review will report about the trials for using cellulose, in different forms, and its derivatives in calcium phosphate mineralization. The review will also include a brief account about definition of the terms hybrid and calcium phosphate mineralization with various examples of these hybrids, which represented ever-increasing interest in the past few years.\n2. Cellulose structure\nCellulose is a naturally occurring, renewable, biodegradable and biocompatible polymer. Soft and hard wood from higher plants, certain bacteria, fungi and several marine animals are the most exploited sources of cellulose [5,12]. There are several polymorphs of crystalline cellulose (I, II, IIII, IIIII, IVI, and IVII) with cellulose I and II being the dominant crystalline forms [5]. Cellulose I, crystalline cellulose, is naturally produced by variety of organisms (trees, plants, tunicates, algae, and bacteria). Its structure is thermodynamically metastable and can be converted to either cellulose II or III. Cellulose II, with monoclinic structure, has themost stable structure and can be produced by either regeneration ormercerization [13]. Cellulose III can be formed from cellulose I or II through liquid ammonia treatments, and subsequent thermal treatments can then be used to form cellulose IV. Cellulose is a long-chain, high molecular weight homopolymer composed of dimers or disaccharides from D-anhydroglucopyranose units (AGU) joined together via β1,4-glycosidic bonds [13] and every othermonomer is rotated 180°with respect to its neighboringunit. The degree of polymerization (DP) varies from few hundred to 20,000 AGU unit depending on the source and extraction technique [14]. The intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds not only provide cellulose with excellent mechanical properties but also render it insoluble inmost solvents [12]. The reactivity of the three hydroxyl groups at C-2, C-3 and C-6 offers possibilities for preparing useful derivatives. The properties of the derivatives dependmainly on the type, distribution and uniformity of the substituting groups. The average number of hydroxyl groups replaced by the substituents is the degree of substitution (DS), the maximum being three. When side-chain formation is possible, molar substitution (MS) is used to denote the lengthof side chain. Properties that aremost strongly affected by DS and MS are the solubility and plasticity. Chemical modifications of cellulose were performed for increasing cellulose functionality and consequently increasing its bioactivity for inorganic mineralization [15,16].\nCellulose and its derivatives can be used as sustainable alternatives to many synthetic polymers required for many industries. Several examples of cellulose derivatives which are widely applied in biomedical and industrial fields include cellulose ethers and cellulose esters such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), cellulose acetate, hydroxyethyl cellulose and cellulose propionate [17]. Cellulose exhibits unique features, such as low density (1.5–1.6 g cm−3), bio degradability, high tensile strength (290–600 MPa for crystalline cellulose), and high Young's modulus (100–140 GPa for the crystalline region) [17]. However, cellulose suffers from significant drawbacks such as poor solubility in aqueous and organic solvents, poor functionality and poor dimensional\nstability. Research efforts have focused on improving cellulose functionality to expand the scope of its use. Hybrid materials made from cellulose and inorganics are promising class of materials which have been widely applied as composite polymer films, sponges, hydrogels, ion exchangers,membranes, dressing shells for encapsulated drugs, etc. These materials are also very attractive from a sustainability point of view, since they enable using of renewable resources and reduce the use of petroleum-based synthetic polymers [16,18].\n3. Hybrid materials\nHybrid materials are composites obtained by mixing at least two components, commonly inorganic and organic materials on the molecular scale. The use of hybrid materials in biomedical formulations is highly beneficial owing to the combined properties of both the organic moiety, such as functionality and flexibility, with heat resistance and stability of the inorganic materials [19,20]. Hybrids can be synthesized via different approaches: Biomimetic mineralization, sol-gel process, exchange or grafting. The interaction between the organic and inorganic parts in the hybrid can be via weak bonds (hydrogen, van derWaal's or ionic bonds) or strong chemical bonds (covalent or iono-covalent bonds) [21].\nBio-hybrids such as bones, teeth, and shells exhibit distinct morphologies and created by animals for exact functions such as structural support, sensing, and toxic waste removal. Preparation of new hybrids with distinct structure andmorphology is very effective for biomaterials such as bone tissue engineering [22] and encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs [23].Moreover, hybridmaterials have themerits of organicmaterials such as lightness, pliability and functionality besides the heat resistance and the stability of inorganic compounds [20]. Polysaccharides/ inorganic hybrid materials represent generic importance in the formulation of biocompatible microcapsules [24,25]. For example, the incorporation of montmorillonite into regenerated cellulose film was significantly improved thermal stability, mechanical and gas barrier properties of the cellulose materials [26]. Moreover, the mineralization in the presence of organic polymers can led to different mineral phases. Cellulose/CaCO3 hybrid showed that increasing cellulose concentration was found to favor CaCO3 growth and has an influence on themorphologies change of CaCO3 from polyhedral to cube [27]. However, poor interaction between the polymer and inorganic represents obstacles that cannot be entirely ignored.\nBiomineralization is the process of in-vivo formation of inorganic minerals. Recently, mineralization has emerged as a smart technique for the design of innovative materials and systems [28]. Moreover, bio-inspired strategies are fascinating tool for constructing wonderful sophisticated and hierarchical features. Biomimetic hybrid materials composed of cellulose and calcium phosphate components have attracted increasing interest in biomaterials [1]. The development of biomineralization-inspired (bio) materials based on cellulose and its derivatives is a promising technique. There are many publications on bioinspiredmineralization of calciumphosphate controlled by synthetic polymers (see refs [1, 22]), the researchwork on cellulose and its derivatives as interesting candidates for calcium phosphate growth is still limited.\n4. Calcium phosphate phases\nCalcium phosphate is the main inorganic constituent of biological hard tissues such as bone and teeth. It gives organs stability, hardness, and function. Biologically formed calcium phosphate is often nanocrystals that are precipitated undermild conditions. Calciumphosphate has an excellent biocompatibility and consequently it has found biomedical applications, particularly for hard-tissue regeneration [29]. It can be prepared in different amorphous and crystalline phases according to the preparation conditions. The different phases vary in their chemical and mechanical properties [22]. In polymer-controlled\ncalcium phosphate mineralization, different phases such as amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD, brushite CaHPO4·2H2O), dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (DCPA, monetite CaHPO4), hydroxyapatite (HAP, (Ca5(PO4)3OH)), chloroapatite (ClAP, (Ca5(PO4)3Cl)), floroapatite (FAP, (Ca5(PO4)3F)) were reported [30]. Studying the biomimetic crystallization of calcium phosphate is crucial to design biocompatible implants and to treat diseases related tomineralization. In the field of calciumphosphatemineralization, the details about the transformation pathways into crystalline materials are not intensely investigated like calcium carbonate [22]. However, few models have been proposed to interpret the calcium phosphate mineralization and Fig. 1 shows a recent example proposed the mineralization at the interfaces.\nIn the field of biologically inspired mineralization process, many efficient additives are availablewith complex influence on themineralization reaction. During this review, the outcome of the mineralization experiments produced from using cellulose or its derivatives as additives will be discussed.\n5. Applications of cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrids\n5.1. Bone grafting and regeneration\nBone, the major normal calcification presented in mammals, serves as structural support for the body and as the reservoir of calcium and phosphate ions needed for different functions in the body. It is a compositematerial of biological apatite and type I collagen. The hierarchical organization of bone has been successfully simulated by HAmineralization on amphiphilic peptide nanofibers, collagen and synthetic polymers [1].\nCellulose has been established to be biocompatible polymer for both granulation tissue and bone regeneration. The presence of hydroxyl groups facilitates the immobilization of cell adhesive proteins such as fibronectin [32]. Searching for new human-derived bone tissue is required due to the donor supply shortage and the infection risk. Therefore, to overcome these problems, the regeneration of bone tissue using sustainable hybrid materials has developed as a promising technique in tissue engineering. Hybrid materials designed for bone regeneration applications should have distinct properties. These hybrids must be biocompatible, biodegradable and osteoconductive.\nCalcium phosphate hybrids have attracted great interest and recommended for many medical tasks due to their bioactivity, biocompatibility and the compositional resemblancewith the humane bone. HAP and tricalcium phosphate are themost commonly applied famous phases in\nFig. 1.Model of calcium phosphate nucleatio Reprinted from Ref. [31] with permission fro\nthe preparation of hybridmaterials for biomedical applications [33]. The mineralization of calcium phosphate phases on the artificial implant is crucial for joining the implant to the natural bone [34]. Biomimetic strategy is an essential route for the formation of calcium phosphate on the polymers for developing new polymer based bioactive materials [35]. Polysaccharides such as cellulose, chitin [36], chitosan [37], alginate [38] or their derivatives are subjected to a solution mimicking the inorganic ingredients in the human blood plasma, which is generally referred to simulated body fluid (SBF) for studying the capability of calcium phosphate growth.\n5.2. Drug delivery applications\nControlled drug delivery aims to deliver the drug at a predetermined rate for a specified period of time. Inorganic materials or polymers, or their combination, were used for preparation of drug delivery systems such as vesicles, micelles, nanocapsules, nanospheres, microspheres, microemulsions, films, or hydrogels [39]. The drug release can be by diffusion, degradation, swelling and affinity-based mechanisms [40]. The most important strategies of controlled release drug systems is the maintenance of drug level within a desired range and to achieve more effective therapies. Controlled drug delivery occurs when a drug or an active substance, embedded within or combined with the excipient, is released in a predesigned manner, whether constant or cyclic, over a long period. Polymers are commonly used to modify the drug release characteristics not usually offered by conventional dosage forms, such as solutions, ointments etc.… [41].\nPolysaccharides/calcium phosphate hybrid materials are interesting smart materials that can overcome the burst release problems of drugs from the organic matrices [25]. Hydroxyapatite, themain calcium phosphate form in humane natural bone, can be readily resorbed into bone tissues. Moreover, calcium phosphate has been extensively studied for medical applications and is characterized by excellent biocompatibility, bioactivity as well as osteoconductivity.\n5.3. Adsorption of heavy metals and dyes\nHigher consumption of synthetic dyes and heavy metals for many industrial applications has led to generating hazardous wastes. Synthetic dyes which commonly used in printing and dyeing industries are often highly toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic [42]. Many attempts have been carried out for preparing cheap and effective adsorbents containing natural polymers to adsorb the toxic dyes from waste water [43–45].\nn and growth at the air water interface. m Springer Nature, copyright 2010.\nCalcium phosphate is capable to establish bonds with organic molecules of different size. However, the powder form or calcined pellets form limits its applications. Organic polymer/calcium phosphate hybrids materials have been investigated for the removal of environmental pollutants such as dyes [46–48]. The few trials for using polysaccharides/calcium phosphate hybrid materials for the removal of environmental pollutants will be reported during the current review."

      "text" : "Various cellulose forms and various cellulose derivatives are widely used for the construction of different cellulose/inorganic hybrid materials, especially cellulose/calcium phosphate hybris. Incorporation of such rigid materials into the cellulose endows it improved mechanical strength as well as stability in the physiological environment. In this review we will focus on different cellulosic forms such as microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), cellulose nanomaterials, bacterial cellulose (BC) and some cellulose derivatives as promising additives for biomimetic calcium phosphate mineralization.\n6.1. Microcrystalline cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrids\nThe abundance, low cost, mechanical robustness and biocompatibility of cellulose are key advantages for using cellulose as a sustainable candidate for preparing new hybrid materials. The regeneration of bone tissues using cellulose basedmaterials is preferred, and has developed as new technique in tissue engineering [49,50]. Different cellulose based bioceramics have been accommodated to increase the osteogenesis properties of cellulose [51]. Howeover, the low processability of cellulose can be an obstacle for constructing a vital complex structure through various modern techniques such as 3D-printing method. Calcium phosphate mineralization on microcrystalline cellulose may produce new hybrids with properties that are required for regeneration of hard tissues.\nSeveral trials have been carried out for preparing cellulose-based materials for bone tissue regeneration. For example, 3D pore-structure composite consisting of cellulose and calcium-deficient-hydroxyapatite was prepared via an electrohydrodynamic printing process supplementedwith an ethanol bath. The osteogenic activities of Alkaline phosphates level and calciummineralization experiments suggested fibrous cellulose/ceramic composite as efficient platform for inducing bone mineralization [32]. However, low solubility in aqueous media and low bioactivity arising from low functionality of cellulose hamper the preparation of real cellulose based hybrid materials. Various research articles have described the successful mineralization of cellulose with various calciumphosphate phases. For example, oriented calcium phosphates were deposited as amorphous form on the surface orientation of the nematic ordered cellulose templates [52]. Langmuir-Blodgett trimethylsilyl cellulosefilmswere treatedwithHCl vapors for preparing regenerated multilayers. This film was employed as a template for biomimetic calcium phosphate mineralization after activation with a Ca (OH)2-suspension prior to the biomimetic mineralization from SBF. The results showed that a layer of highly carbonated apatite lacking hydroxyl ions phase was formed. Moreover, mineralization of carbonated apatite is enhanced on the regenerated cellulose fabrics activated in Ca (OH)2-suspension compared to as-prepared cellulose as shown in Fig. 2 [35]. González et al. tried to activate the three hydroxyl groups presented in the cellulose backbone via reaction with titanium isopropoxide as coupling agent. The authors studied the bioactivity of the three new labile hydroxyl groups originated from the reaction between cellulose and titanium isopropoxide to initiate the growth of calcium phosphate crystals. The results showed that the coupling agent increases the number of labile hydroxyl groups which act as active sites to enhance the combination of calcium and phosphate ions to initiate hydroxyapatite mineralization [53].\nAqueous solutions are the dominant solutions used for calcium phosphate mineralization. Mineralization of non-soluble cellulose in aqueous solutions often produces heterogeneous materials with properties that are not suitable for biomedical applications. The most inadequate issue of cellulose is again its limited solubility in aqueous mineralization media. This restricts the processing and mineralization efficiencies. The insolubility of cellulose reduces the penetration of the calcium and phosphate ions and the mineralization process produces surface or near-surface mineral layers. Ionic liquids (ILs) were emerged as green solvents for dissolving neat cellulose and efficient reaction media for the synthesis of newhomogenous cellulose/inorganic hybrids [54–56]. ILs have also been shown to occasionally lead to inorganic materials that cannot be made via conventional approaches [57–61]. ILs permit to incorporate inorganics, fillers and metal nanoparticles into cellulose matrix which open the avenue towards completely new composite materials with a tailored chemical composition. ILs have been evaluated as convenient strategy for producing real homogenous and hierarchical cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrids. 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride, IL, was used as a reactionmedium to prepare cellulose/calcium phosphate hybridmaterials. This trial proved that the reaction environment controlled the crystal phase of the formed calcium phosphate. Cellulose/hydroxyapatite, cellulose/chlorapatite, or cellulose/monetite hybrids were precipitated at different reaction conditions. MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts cells proliferated on the hybrids proposing that the ionic liquid-based process produces valuable materials for regenerative therapies [2].\nIn our previous study, 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride was used as common solvent to dissolve cellulose and natural wool. The regenerated cellulose/wool blendwas examined as a sustainable bioactive material for calciumphosphate growth fromSBF solution. Themorphology of regenerated cellulose/wool blend is homogenous without phase separation appearance which may be arising from the intermolecular hydrogen bonding betweenwool and cellulose, as shown in Fig. 3. However, the mineralized blend showed fibers-like shape with nanometer sized ordered aggregates composed of hierarchical nanofibers less than 300 nm. These fibers exhibit Ca/P ratio 1.57 ± 0.1 which suggest HAP growth. The results showed also that the uniform crystalline HAP nanofibers mineralized onto the blend is homogenous. The cytotoxicity of the mineralized blend exhibited good cytocompatibility, offering the current material for tissue engineering applications [62].\nAnother trials have been carried out to increase the functionality and hence the bioactivity of cellulose via grafting with plant protein. Cellulose grafted with soy protein isolate was studied as new functionalized cellulose derivative for calcium phosphate mineralization. The authors found that HAPwith a rod-like shape was precipitated. The cytotoxicity of cellulose/soy protein isolate/calciumphosphate hybridwas evaluated using animal fibroblast baby hamster kidney cells and the results suggested this material as potentially useful hybrid for tissue engineering [63]. Moreover, cellulose/soy protein isolate/calcium phosphate hybrid was reported as efficient adsorbent and promising material for water purification. This material showed high adsorption capacity for methylene blue removal and the adsorption capacity reached to 454 mg/g. The adsorption results of the sustainable cellulose grafted SPI/hydroxyapatite hybrid material present the current material as a likely adsorbent for water treatment [3].\n6.2. Cellulose nanomaterials/calcium phosphate hybrids\nMicrocrystalline cellulose, the structural units in higher plants, contains highly ordered (crystalline) domains alternating with disordered (amorphous) regions. Cellulose nanomaterials can be isolated from various lignocellulosic materials such as wood (hardwood and softwood) and other agriculture residues (bagasse, rice straw, cotton stalk, etc.) through various techniques including mechanical, chemical and enzymatic treatments [5,64].\nCellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were extracted mostly through acid hydrolysis process using sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid which cleave the amorphous domains and leaving well-defined crystalline rods (crystalline regions as shown in Fig. 4) [14].\nIn the field of hybrid materials, CNCs have received great attention due to their unique properties such as high surface area of 150–250 m2 g−1, low density, excellent mechanical properties, high aspect ratio and high crystalline order and chirality. CNCs were applied as additives for foods and cosmetics, drug delivery, insulator aerogels, bone or tooth replacementmaterials etc. [14,66]. Different hybridmaterials and hydrogels have been constructed based on CNCs [64,67,68]. For example, the presence of different functional groups onto the CNCs surface has direct impact on the mineralization and growth of HAP from SBF. The HAP content and the surface area measurements showed that the sulfonate and phosphonate groups, originate during acid hydrolysis, significantly contribute in the hydroxyapatite mineralization on the CNCs particles. The biocompatibility of the CNCs/hydroxyapatite materials were evaluated by cell viability measurements using fibroblast cells and the results supported thesematerials for bone tissue engineering. CNCs extracted using sulfuric acid/hydroxyapatite hybrid exhibited an improvement in the cell viability compared with pure HAP [69].\nMai Ishikawa et al. prepared nanosized hybrids through controlled nucleation and growth of a c-axis-oriented HAP onto CNCs. The authors reported the formation of transparent thin coatings via evaporationinduced assembly of CNCs/HAP nanocomposites [70].\nCellulose nanofibers (CNFs) can be prepared from agricultural wastes usingmechanical disintegrationmethods in combinationwith enzymatic\nFig. 3. SEM of cellulose/wool before and after hydroxyapatite min Reprinted from Ref. [62] with permission from Elsevier, copyright\nor mechanical treatments. Using strong mechanical shearing such as grinding, and high-pressure homogenization was found to promote the progressive release of constitutivemicrofibrils. CNFs have gained increasing attention due to their unique properties such as high surface area, good strength properties and abundant availability. One of the most important CNFs is TEMPO-oxidized nanofibrillated cellulose which can be prepared from (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy)-mediated oxidization (TEMPO) of cellulose followed by mechanical defibrillation using high-pressure homogenization. Fig. 5 shows TEM images of CNF and TEMPO-CNF isolated from date palm fruit stalk pulp using Masuko grinder or high-pressure homogenizer.\nTEMPO-oxidized nanofibrillated cellulose was investigated as a sustainable material for preparing injectable hybrid materials for bone regeneration. The hybrid martial was prepared via incorporation of biphasic calcium phosphate at a ratio of 50 wt%. Cytotoxicity and alkaline phosphatase level tests revealed that the TEMPO-oxidized nanofibrillated cellulose based hybrid has nontoxic effect on osteoblast-like cells [49]. Abouzeid et al. studied the mineralization of 3D scaffold of TEMPO-oxidized nanofibrillated cellulose/alginate materials for bone tissue engineering applications, as shown in Fig. 6. The results showed the growth of hydroxyapatite layer with Ca/P ratio 1.76. The thermal analysis estimated the hydroxyapatite content andwas calculated to be 20.1% [72]. In a recent study, the effect of carboxyl content in oxidized CNFs on the HAP growth was investigated. The study showed that the increasing of carboxyl content in the TEMPO-oxidized nanofibrillated cellulose up to 9.9% enhanced the nucleation of HAP from SBF solutions [73].\neralization and TEM of cellulose/wool/hydroxyapatite hybrid. 2016.\n6.3. Bacterial cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrid\nBacterial cellulose (BC) can be produced by some microorganisms, such as Acetobacter xylinum and Gluconacetobacter xylinus [74]. In comparison to the plant-derived cellulose, bacterial cellulose (BC) has amazing properties as respects to the crystalline structure, fibrous aspect, increase surface reactivity, mechanical resistance, biological features, high water holding capacity and high purity [33,75,76]. The diameter of BC is in a range from approximately 25 to 45 nm. It is also considered as nanocellulose. As a consequence, BC is preferred for various biomedical applications, for example artificial skin, blood vessels and scaffolds for tissue engineering and wound dressing [77]. BC has the same plant cellulose structure and exhibits a highly fibrous, and three-dimensional non-woven network structure. Moreover, it is free from the other contaminants such as lignin and hemicellulose [78]. BC, however, is economically unfavorable due to high cost of carbon source [79]. In the aspect of tissue engineering, the important criteria for tissue engineeringmaterials include inhibition of infection, acceleration of calciumphosphatemineralization and a template for the synthesis of inorganic materials having controlled morphologies. BC has recently emerged as promisingmaterial with these respects [80]. BC and calcium phosphate materials have been reported for developing of biomaterials\nFig. 5. TEM of CNFs (left) and TEMPO-oxidized CNFs Image courtesy of M. Hassan.\naddressed to the prosthetics domain and artificial bone. Despite the variety of hydroxyl groups presented on the BC surface, these groups are not reactive to growth the calcium phosphate particles. Different research groups modified the reactivity of individual fibers using various techniques to enhance their bioactivity towards inorganic mineralization [81]. For example, BC/HAP nanocomposites were prepared using phosphorylated and unphosphorylated BC. After soaking the raw BC and modified BC in SBF for 14 days, few crystals of HAP were formed on the surface of BC fibers, when phosphorylation was not performed. However, phosphorylated BC enhances the growth mineralization of HAP crystals. The results exhibited that the formed HAP was partially carbonate substituted, similar to natural bone in structure and crystal size [82].\nThere have been some studies for employing BC hydrogel in calcium phosphate mineralization through biomimetic process in SBF [83]. During the biomimetic mineralization, BC were negatively charged or functionalized via introducing new anionic functional groups ormixingwith anionic polymers. The presence of such acidic groups will initiate the heterogeneous nucleation and regulate the crystal growth of calcium phosphate. For example, Hutchens et al. prepared new hybrid material from BC hydrogel and calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite. BC was incubated in CaCl2 solution followed by Na2HPO4 solution and high apatite\n(right) isolated from date palm fruit stalks [71].\ncontent was homogenously precipitated in the hydrogel. SEM images showed that the mineralized calcium phosphate is uniform spherical calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite particles contained nanosized crystallites with a lamellar morphology as shown in Fig. 7. The chemical structure of this composite is similar to natural bone apatite indicating that BC is a promising template for biomimetic apatite formation [84].\nAlso, in the field of tissue engineering, the preparation of calcium phosphate scaffolds was carried out using BC as template. The prepared scaffolds were heated under high temperature in air to remove the bacterial cellulose and mineral phases with different morphologies were obtained. Varying the calcination temperature and the time period was found to effect on the porosity and grains dimension of themineral scaffolds. The pyrophosphate produced after calcination has porous architectures consisting of grains connected on the three spatial directions as illustrated in Fig. 8. Moreover, the bioactivity and biocompatibility of the preparedmaterials have established to be suitable for bone regeneration purposes [33].\n6.4. Cellulose derivatives/calcium phosphate hybrid\nBesides cellulose, cellulose derivatives such as CMC and hydroxyethyl cellulose are important materials in the field of calcium phosphatemineralization. Two of the key advantages of cellulose derivatives are their solubility in aqueous solutions and the different protocols available for chemical modification. As a result, many research\ngroups have evaluated the preparation of cellulose derivatives/calcium phosphate hybrids.\n6.4.1. CMC/calcium phosphate hybrids Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is one of themostwater soluble cellulose derivatives. CMC with a DS ranging from 0.4 to 1.3 has gained special concern because of its versatile applications in, for example, cosmetics and adhesives. CMC degrades at low rates in the environment forming nontoxic intermediate [85]. Moreover, CMC has good packing ability for insoluble drugs and bioactive materials [86]. The chemical modifications of CMC can offer additional properties that improve its overall characteristics. The synthesis of cellulose derivatives containing dispersed inorganic nanoparticles is expected to add new properties and hence open new avenues for applications in catalysis, electronics, sensors, nanocomposites, drug delivery, and food packaging [87].\nThe presence of carboxyl groups in CMC will initiate the nucleation of calcium phosphate in analogy with calcium phosphate growth in collagen-based natural bone tissues. Various cellulose derivatives which exhibit a higher water solubility in aqueous solutions have been used as alternatives for preparing calcium phosphate scaffolds. CMC/HAP hybrids display good osteoconductivity and biodegradability in different biomedical applications. HAP nanocrystals were drowned in CMC-based hydrogel matrix for preparing hybrid material. CMC hydrogel was dipped in HAP solutions with different concentrations. Although the authors reported a degree of distribution for\n53%HAP (b) with magnification. sion from Elsevier, copyright 2006.\nhydroxyapatite crystals on the surface and inside the hydrogel matrix, the morphology of this kind of hybrids is far from the structure of the humane bone. The most real and efficient strategy for preparing hybrid materials resemble natural bone is biomimetic mineralization technique [88].\nThe calcium phosphate nucleation on CMC/silica hybrids was investigated for biomimetic calcium phosphate mineralization. The authors suggested that the bioactivity of CMC/silica hybrids is governed by the CMC content. Although, amorphous calcium phosphate was formed in the presence of low CMC content, HAP was formed in case of high CMC content. The compressivemodulus and strain at failure of CMC/silica hybrids increasedwith the increasing of CMC content up to 15% [89].\nVarious trials have been carried out to increase the bioactivity of CMC through various techniques such as grafting with synthetic monomers. Polyacrylic acid (PAA) is an acidic polymer that can absorb the ions to initiate the mineralization process. PAA was grafted onto CMC to increase its bioactivity towards inorganic mineralization. CMC-gPAA hydrogel was prepared and evaluated as a bioactive hydrogel for biomimetic calcium phosphate mineralization. After immersing in SBF, calcium phosphate layers comprised of spherical particles with diameter ~2mmwere formed. The in-vitro assessment displayed that the prepared CMC-g-PAA/calcium phosphate nanocomposite possess pH sensitivity. The swelling and drug release properties showed that the effect of mineralization process onto in-vitro bovine serum albumin release showed pH sensitivity and efficient capability for BSA encapsulation and delivery [90]. In our previous study, CMC backbone was grafted with crosslinked polydimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (CMC-g-PDMAEMA) and then subjected to biomimetic calcium phosphatemineralization. The resulted CMC-g-PMAEMA/calciumphosphate hybrid was investigated as a drug carrier and the results showed significant efficiency of the formed hybrid to deliver bovine serum albumin [91]. In another study, CMC-grafted polymethacrylic acid (CMC-gPMAA) was prepared by graft copolymerization technique. CMC-g-\nFig. 9. TEM and SAED of CMC-g-P Reprinted from Ref. [93] with per\nPMAA was examined as graft copolymer controlled calcium phosphate mineralization at different copolymer concentration and pHs. At acidic conditions, a fiber-like structure consisting of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate was formed at high graft copolymer content. However, plate-like structure was formed at low concentration of CMC-g-PMAA. In basic condition, uniform nanosphere particles with different sizes of hydroxyapatite were precipitated. CMC-g-PMAA/calcium phosphate hybrid with bone-like composition could be examined as a bone grafting material [92]. In our previous study, PMAA/hydroxyapatite hybridwas prepared and applied as efficient adsorbent formethylene blue removal from aqueous solutions. TEMexhibited rods-like appearance of the mineralized hydroxyapatite with diameter less than 100 nm. The lattice structure of the crystalline rods showed interplanar spacing ∼0.34 nm and selected area electron diffraction pattern showed apatite-crystal diffraction features with Arc-shaped and some additional diffraction spots as shown in Fig. 9. The hybrid material exhibited adsorption capacity up to 671 mg/g and the adsorption process follow Pseudo-second- order and Langmuir isotherm models [93].\nIn another study, CMC/calcium phosphate hybrid sheets were prepared via alternate soaking the disc-shaped CMC sheet in CaCl2/TrisHCl (Ca solution) and Na2HPO4 (P solution). Themineralization process of protonated-CMC sheets produced mineralized sheets with mixed phase of brushite and hydroxyapatite. The CMC/calcium phosphate sheet was found to encourage marker gene expressions for later phase of osteoblast differentiation. Moreover, themineralized sheets promote the calcification osteoblast differentiation of humanmesenchymal stromal cells [94].\nCMC, hydroxyapatite and lysine were used to prepare new membranes either by conventional casting or double decomposition methods. There is a great difference in the physical and mechanical properties of the two membranes. Although the membrane produced from casting method exhibited rough, stiff properties and partially soluble in water, the other membrane exhibited smooth, flexible\nMAA/hydroxyapatite hybrid. mission from Elsevier, copyright 2016.\nproperties and low water solubility. The prepared trifunctional membrane is useful for extracting toxic material bisphenol A (BPA) from baby food containers. Also it exhibited antimicrobial and antifungal properties and could be a suitable candidate for use in bone tissue engineering [95].\nIn the field of drug delivery, cellulose derivatives/calciumphosphate hybrids were investigated to design a novel simple technique to control the release rate of the drugs and overcome the repeatedly observed burst release problems of drugs from organic matrices. CMC/chitosan polyelectrolytewas prepared and investigated as a sustainable template for biomimetic calcium phosphate mineralization through different SBF\nconcentrations. The results showed that different hybridswith different organic/inorganic ratios exhibited different equilibrium swelling ratios. The CMC/chitosan/calcium phosphate hybrids attain the equilibrium swelling after long time. The equilibrium swelling and drug release profile was controlled with increasing the calcium phosphate% in the hybrids. The mineralized calcium phosphate crystals could hinder the permeability of the encapsulated drug and decrease the drug release profile [96]. Regenerated cellulose acetate (CA) of electrospun mat was modified with the CMC to increase its carboxylic content and consequently increase its bioactivity for inorganic mineralization. HAP growth on electrospun fiberswas found to be enhanced by the presence\nof carboxyl groups originated from CMC adsorption on the electrospun fibers. The study exhibited that surface chemicalmodification of the cellulosic substrates can provide promising materials for bone regeneration [97].\n6.4.2. Other cellulose derivatives/calcium phosphate hybrids Different cellulose derivatives were studied as growth modifier and templates for biomimetic calcium phosphate mineralization. A. Taubert et al. studied the effect of the charges presented on the cellulose surface on the growth of calcium phosphate. Variouswater soluble cellulose derivatives a polyanion, a polycation, and a polyzwitterion were studied for the synthesis and design of bioinspired and bio-based hybrid materials. The authors studied three variables, polymer composition, polymer concentration, and precursor concentration on the mineralization process. The results showed that the precursor concentration controls the phase of the precipitated calcium phosphate, either HAP (at low concentration) or DCPD (at high concentration). This is independent of the presence or absence of cellulose derivatives as additive. EDXs elemental analysis results exhibited that a higher cellulose derivative concentration enhances the formation of cellulose-enriched hybrids. This study shows that water-soluble cellulose derivatives enhanced the growth of true calcium phosphate/polymer “real” hybrid material [98].\nHydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) is widely applied in various fields especially pharmaceutical industries. HEC, non-ionic and water soluble polymer, is appropriate for bone tissue engineering applications. HEC functionalizedwith bone-like calcium phosphatewas prepared through electrospinning andmineralized by incubating in concentrated SBF. The mineralized HEC/polyvinyl alcohol hybrid improved cell proliferation and was suggested as promising material for bone regeneration [99].\nChiral nematic liquid crystalline gels of (ethyl) cellulose/PAA and (hydroxypropyl) cellulose/PAA in a film formwere investigated as scaffolding medium for precipitation of calcium phosphate. Immersing the cellulosic/PAA films in a salt solution containing calcium and phosphate ions showed the growth of amorphous calcium phosphate and less ordered HAP. The results of the study revealed that the calciumphosphate mineralization significantly improved the thermal and mechanical properties of the optically functionalized cellulosic/synthetic polymer composites [100].\nIt is clear from this review that using cellulose as a biomaterial for calcium phosphate mineralization instead of synthetic polymers is a recent trend inmaterial science. There are some recent trials for preparing specific cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrids that are promising candidates for further materials development. It is clear that extended investigation of different cellulosic forms and cellulose derivativeswill enable a much better understanding of how hybrid materials formed through biomineralization. Comparison of data obtained from different cellulose derivatives suggests that cellulose solubility and functionality is the main factors that control the nucleation and morphologies of the final hybridmaterials. In recognition of themany trials available from the literature, we have attempted to collect all cellulosic materials used for preparing hybridmaterials and to compile themost important information into a table (Table 1).\n7. Summary\nCellulose, the most abundant biopolymer, and its derivatives are widely used for developing and constructing smart organic/inorganic hybrid materials. Cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrid materials combine the properties of both components, functionality and flexibility of the cellulosewith heat resistance and stability of the inorganic material. This review summarizes and discusses the trials carried out to use cellulosic materials as promising candidate for bio-mimetic calcium phosphate mineralization. There has been an increasing interest for applying cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrids in different biomedical and environmental applications such as building high performance and novel natural bone, drug delivery systems and adsorbents.\nMoreover, increasing the functionality of cellulose through different techniques to enhance the bioactivity of cellulosic materials towards mineral nucleation and growth has significantly improved. These trials suggest that cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrid materials could become promising generation for environmental and biomedical applications. However, there is still a need to investigate much deeper into the individual steps that lead to a usefulwell-defined complex cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrids.\nAcknowledgments\nI thank Prof. Dr. Andreas Taubert from Potsdam University for hosting me in his research group during my PhD, where I learned the principles of calcium phosphate mineralization.\nReferences\n[1] S.

    "abstractText" : "Article history: Received 16 November 2018 Received in revised form 23 January 2019 Accepted 23 January 2019 Available online 25 January 2019 The use of cellulose as an alternative to synthetic polymers might permit the decrease of environmental impacts by achieving more easily biodegradable or reusable materials. Recently, cellulose and inorganics are synergistically coupled to tailor promising functional hybridswith unique properties. The current reviewpresents an overview of the recent trials for preparing cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrid materials and offers prospects for many new applications in diverse fields. During the whole review, different cellulose forms and cellulose derivatives are being explored as fillers or templates for the design of new functional materials and support for the loading of different calcium phosphate phases. The functionalization of cellulose with calcium phosphate was carried out to construct new and attractive physicochemical properties that are being exploited for different applications such as bone regeneration, drug delivery vehicles, dental repair and adsorption. The studying of cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrid materials is supported by increasing concern in providing smart materials that combine best of the calcium phosphate properties along with cellulose. The review also aims to study the driving forces and limitations towards structuring of cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrid materials. It appears that the use of cellulosic materials for constructing new hybrids is very promising for biomedical and environmental applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
