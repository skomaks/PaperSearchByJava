Constructed wetlands (CWs) are ecological wastewater treatment facilities and can intercept the vast particles pollutant, including CBNs. However, the impacts of CBNs on the treatment performance of CWs have no available knowledge. Therefore, we systematically inspected the effects of single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs and MWCNTs) and fullerene nanoparticles (C60) on CW performance under 180-day exposure to 0, 10 and 1000 μg/L concentrations. The results showed that CBNs had marginally adverse impacts on chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total phosphorus (TP) removal, whereas nitrogen removal declined by 24.1 %–42.7 % following long-term exposure to CBNs. MWCNTs had the greatest inhibition effect on nitrogen removal, followed by SWCNTs and C60. The CBNs also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction as the increasing concentration, which confirmed that CBNs have biotoxic effects in CWs. The variation of functional microbial community and the inhibition of enzyme activities were the dominant reasons for the decline in nitrogen removal efficiency. Furthermore, predictive functional profiling showed that CBNs affected functional gene abundance, and caused a decline in the enzymes abundance connected to nitrogen removal by the end of the 180-day exposure period.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123270 Received 9 February 2020; Received in revised form 8 June 2020; Accepted 20 June 2020\n⁎ Corresponding author.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs) are widely used in many fields because they have unique mechanical properties, thermal persistence, and are chemically stable (De Volder et al., 2013; Ghorbanpour and Hadian, 2015; Mauter and Elimelech, 2008). It has been estimated that tens of thousands of tons of CBNs have been produced over the last few years (Zhang et al., 2013). The extensive synthesis, use, and disposal of products containing CBNs (single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and fullerene (C60) nanoparticles) have meant that large numbers of CBNs have inevitably been released into the aqueous environment and soil (Liu et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2019). Furthermore, the presence of these CBNs has caused a series of adverse impacts on the ecological environment (Felix et al., 2016; Rodrigues et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017).\nGenerally, the CBNs are released into the sewer and then drain into wastewater treatment systems (Goyal et al., 2010; Hai et al., 2014). Activated sludge technology plays an important role in the wastewater treatment process, and a majority of the previous studies on this subject have focused on CBN biotoxicity to activated sludge (Goyal et al., 2010; Luongo and Zhang, 2010). It has been reported that C60 can alter the surface structure of activated sludge because it is adsorbed onto the surface and this causes variations in the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that occur on the surface of activated sludge (Yang et al., 2017). Hai et al. (2014) found that long-term (180 days) exposure to 1 and 20 mg/L of MWCNTs resulted in a decrease in the nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency. Luongo and Zhang (2010) further confirmed the potential biotoxic effects of MWCNTs on bacterial community structure in activated sludge, and respiration inhibition was observed when MWCNTs were present. A study by Su et al. (2015) found that SWNTs-OH caused a significant decline in key enzyme activities, carbon source utilization, and the intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio, which finally prevented nitrate reduction when SWNTs-OH were present in activated sludge. Those impacts of CBNs on activated sludge can be remitted with the periodical sludge discharging, while in no sludge discharging system how the treatment performance and functional biology in wastewater treatment systems respond to CBNs stress is still unclear.\nConstructed wetlands (CWs), as an important biofilm system, have received increasing attention (Vymazal, 2007). Contaminants are removed in CWs through a series of complex physical, chemical, and biological processes that are connected to microbial activities responsible for various nutrient conversions (Chen et al., 2016a; Vymazal, 1998). Additionally, CWs have no sludge discharging process. When wastewater that contains nanoparticle pollutants enters the CWs, the vast majority of the nanoparticle pollutants (over 90 %) are retained and accumulate in the CWs (Huang et al., 2019b; Yang et al., 2018). As a result, CWs are generally considered to be nanoparticle pollutant hotspots (Huang et al., 2019a). The CBNs, which are the most important nanoparticles pollutant in wastewater (Lead et al., 2018), may be retained in CWs in a similar way to metal nanoparticles. After entering the wetland systems, the CBNs may attach to biofilm and become immobilized in the CWs. Concurrently, the CBNs retained in CWs may also inhibit microbial activity, which will negatively impact the CW treatment performance. However, to date, there have been no studies on the effects of different CBNs on biofilm nutrient removal efficiency and microbial activity and community structure when CWs are subjected to long-term CBN exposure. Therefore, the effects of prolonged exposure to CBNs under model environmental concentration conditions should be investigated in order to veritably assess the impacts of CBNs on biological nutrient removal in CWs.\nOur study used subsurface-flow (SSF) CWs to investigate the impacts of different carbon-based nanomaterials on nitrogen and phosphorus removal, and microbial community structure and activity under 180-day exposure. We selected 10 μg/L as the conventional CBN concentration in wastewater (Chen et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010) and\n1000 μg/L as the high concentration to simulate the industrial effluent concentration (Ambuchi et al., 2017; Tong et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2013). The objectives of this study were to: (a) investigate the longterm impacts of CBN pollution on CW performance; (b) reveal the biotoxicity of CBNs by analyzing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release; (c) explore the responses of microbial community structure and enzyme activities; and (d) quantify the microbial functional genes and enzymes abundance under long-term exposure to CBNs."

      "text" : "The three kinds of CBNs used in this study were purchased from XFNANO Materials Technology Company (Jiangsu Province, China). The SWNTs and MWNTs are 1−2 nm and 10−20 nm in main diameters and both 10−30 μm in lengths, respectively. The C60 is 99 % purified through sublimation. In the exposure experiment, single-walled (SW) and multi-walled (MW) carbon nanotubes were placed in 12 M HCl solution for 11 h to remove any residual metal catalysts (Hai et al., 2014; Su et al., 2015) and then washed with copious amounts of deionized water until the pH was neutral. Pristine C60 was disbanded in toluene by continuous shaking for 2 h at 150 rpm, and then deionized water was added until it reached four times the volume of the toluene (Huang et al., 2014). The mixture was sonically treated with intermittent oscillations until the toluene had been volatilized in a fuming cupboard. It was then filtered through a 0.22 μm disposable sterile filter (ANPEL, Shanghai, China) (Huang et al., 2014). All washed CBNs were dried in an oven (60 °C) overnight so that a powder could be obtained.\nThe environmental and factory emission concentrations were simulated by preparing 10 and 1000 μg/L CBN suspensions, respectively. Briefly, 1.2 g of the three different CBNs were dissolved in 100 mL of wastewater by sonication treatment for 0.5 h (25 °C, 250 W, and 40 kHz), and then 10 μL and 1 mL of the solutions were added to 12 L artificial wastewater in a bucket (Yang et al., 2018). The morphology and size of the CBNs in the stock suspensions were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1400, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) (Fig. S1) (Mao et al., 2020). The compositions of the artificial wastewater simulating the WWTP influent are shown in the Supporting Information (SI, Text S1). Briefly, the artificial wastewater concentration contained about 200 mg/L COD, 35 mg/L TN, 20 mg/L NH4+-N, 1.2 mg/L NO3−-N, and 5 mg/L TP (Yang et al., 2018)."

Four groups were configured as follows: three controls (no CBNs), six SWCNTs treatments (three each of 10 and 1000 μg/L groups), six MWCNTs treatments (same configuration) and six C60 treatments (same configuration). Each with a bulk volume of 0.045 m3 (length: 0.3 m, width: 0.3 m, and height: 0.5 m) and a pore volume of 12 L, were constructed. All the CWs were filled with gravel (Φ: 8–10 mm, porosity: 0.4) up to a height of 40 cm and planted with cattail (Typha latifolia). Each CW microcosm was worked in batch mode, and the hydraulic retention time (HRT) is 5 days. Synthetic wastewater was fed into the reactor via the pipe and drained via a tap on the bottom, and the water level was attuned to be 5 cm below the gravel bed surface. Four systems containing three no CBNs feeding microcosms, six SWCNTs-fed microcosms (three low concentrations and three high concentrations), six MWCNTs-fed microcosms (the same as above), and six C60-fed microcosms (the same as above) were established. All the wetland microcosms were located in a 25± 1 °C greenhouse and light intensity was fixed a constant level of about 425 μmol m−2 s-1 via the searchlights. The wetland microcosm design is described in our previous study (Chen et al., 2016b). Prior to\nthe start of the experiment, wetland microcosms were fed with the modified influent for a 4-month pre-incubation period to establish the plant shoots and biofilm. The condition of the plant and biofilm in the CW microcosms after the 4-month pre-incubation period was showed in the Supporting Information (Fig. S2)."

      "text" : "Fig. 1 shows the variations in NH4+-N, NO3–-N, and TN\nconcentrations due to the CBNs during the 180-day exposure experiment. In the control group, the NH4+-N concentration in the effluent remained stable (average 7.48 mg/L), and the removal efficiency was about 81.5 %. However, NH4+-N removal decreased with increasing concentration and exposure time in the three CBN treatment groups. For example, the removal efficiencies for NH4+-N in the presence of 10 and 1000 μg/L SWCNTs decreased to 69.0 % and 51.3 %, respectively, compared to the control. Similar effects were observed for MWCNTs and C60. The 10 and 1000 μg/L MWCNT treatments removal efficiencies decreased to about 53.1 % and 41.6 %, respectively, and the C60 treatments decreased to 55.8 % and 51.8 %, respectively, over the 180- day exposure period. In our study, the control group NO3−-N concentration in the effluent remained at about 0.06± 0.04 mg/L and there was no obvious fluctuation over the 180-day exposure period. However, the NO3−-N concentration in the effluent increased slightly and eventually reached about 0.6 mg/L in the 10 and 1000 μg/L CBN treatments over the 180 days (Fig. 1), which might result from the decline of denitrifying enzyme (e.g., NAR) and the abundance reduce of denitrifiers. Fig. 1 also shows that TN removal efficiency stabilized at about 72.0 % in the control experiments, but decreased in the treatment groups. The MWCNT treatments had the lowest TN removal efficiency at 49.1 % for the 10 μg/L treatment and 43.2 % for 1000 μg/L treatment. This was followed by the C60 treatments (54.1 % and 43.4 %, respectively) and the SWCNT treatments (57.2 % and 51.7 %, respectively).\nThe impacts of CBNs on nitrogen removal in activated sludge systems have been sporadically reported. Hai et al. (2014) observed that TN removal efficiency decreased by 14.4 % after 180-day exposure to 20 mg/L MWCNTs, but it was not significantly affected by exposure to 1 mg/L MWCNTs. Differently, Zheng et al. (2014b) found that the presence of CBNs had no significant impacts on nitrogen and phosphorus removal at an exposure concentration of 100 mg/L in SBR. The C60-fed results reported in previous studies are different to our results. Yang et al. (2012) confirmed that C60 had no impact on nitrification in activated sludge and Huang et al. (2014) found that the nitrate removal rate increased to nearly 55 % when the effluent was exposed to 5 mg/L C60 in activated sludge. However, the abovementioned studies used activated sludge as the research object. CWs have a lower biomass in per volume (Vymazal, 1998) and is more sensitive to nanoparticle pollutants than activated sludge treatments (Yang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2011). Additionally, unlike activated sludge, CWs have no regular sludge discharging, which causes the serious accumulation of CBNs. Therefore, these results are mainly responsible for the inhibition in performance of CWs under long-term exposure to lower concentration of CBNs compared with activated sludge."

The average removal efficiencies for COD and TP in all the treatment groups were almost the same as the control at about 80 % for COD and 25 % for TP (Fig. S3). Previous studies have gotten similar results (Hai et al., 2014), and reported that 180-day exposure to 20 mg/L MWCNTs had no adverse impacts on COD removal in activated sludge. Additionally, Zheng et al. (2014b) found that the presence of 100 mg/L SWCNTs and MWCNTs did not affect soluble ortho-phosphorus (SOP) removal efficiency in an activated sludge system after one exposure cycle. Similarly, Wang et al. (2012) also reported that the 0.5–2.5 mg/L C60 treatments did not adversely affect COD removal in biological reactors. All these results indicated that the presence of CBNs has no significant impact on COD and TP removal in wastewater treatment systems and the previous results were consistent with our results."

      "text" : "ROS production is caused by oxidative stress, which can damage cellular components, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (Applerot et al., 2012). Fig. 2 shows that ROS production had considerably increased at the end of the long-term exposure period. When the CWs were exposed to 10 and 1000 μg/L CBNs, ROS production increased by 109 % and 335 % for SWCNTs, 310 % and 597 % for MWCNTs, and 68 % and 106 % for C60, respectively, compared to the control. The extracellular LDH level was used to measure cell membrane integrity (Hou et al., 2014). The release of LDH slightly increased by 6.0 % and 6.8 % for SWCNTs, 2.1 % and 2.5 % for MWCNTs, and 1.5 % and 2.2 % for C60, respectively, compared to the control groups. These results indicated that the presence of CBNs caused no significant damage (p>0.05) to microbial membrane integrity. The above results\nalso agree with previous studies. Ma et al. (2019) reported that exposure to 10 and 30 mg/L MWCNTs for 148 days in SBR increased ROS production, but Su et al. (2015) found that 24 h exposure to SWCNTs had no significant effects on LDH release. As we known, the ROS overproduction and accumulation indiscriminately attacked the components of cell membrane and led to the lipid peroxidation of microbial cell membrane (Venditti et al., 2013). Therefore, in our study, the presence of CBNs provided more chances of ROS production, and increased the possibility of enzyme protein on the membrane damage. Because numerous enzymes are located at the bilayer phospholipid membrane or periplasm, the damage of enzyme protein on cell membrane was one main reason for the decline of nutrient removal efficiency under long-term exposure."

      "heading" : "3.2.2. Microbial community structure variations in CWs subjected to CBNs",
      "text" : "The variation in microbial community structure after long-term exposure to the three kinds of CBNs was investigated in order to fully\nunderstand the effects of CBNs on microbes in wetland microcosms. As shown in Fig. S4, the rarefaction curves for the microbial samples indicated that they approximately trended toward relative stabilization as the sequences number increased, which signified that the detected sequencing depth had effectively covered the whole microbial species in all samples and was reasonable at different CBNs structure and concentrations. In addition, Table 1 shows the Alpha diversity results and summarizes the key information gained from the microbial samples and important microbial community indexes for the treatment groups. The Chao, Simpson and Shannon indexes are related to the richness, evenness, and diversity of a microbial community, respectively. Table 1 shows that the Chao (2590.17± 69.73, p>0.05), Simpsoneven (0.03±0.0001, p>0.05), and Shannon (5.27±0.067, p>0.05) indexes for the control were similar to those for the three kinds of experimental groups, which indicated that the presence of CBNs did not obviously affect microbial diversity. Our results were consistent with the study reported by Khodakovskaya et al. (2013), which showed that MWCNTs did not affect soil bacterial diversity after a 9-week stress period. However, Hai et al. (2014) and Goyal et al. (2010) reported that the continuous addition of 20 mg/L MWCNTs and 0–3.5 g/L SWCNTs, respectively, significantly decreased the α-diversity of the microbial community in activated sludge, which suggests that the impacts CBNs have on microbial diversity in different systems is not clear. Additionally, the coverage value was always about 0.99 in the different groups, which also suggested that microbial diversity in CWs was adequately covered by the sequence libraries obtained from the microbial samples.\nThe taxonomic abundance scenarios for the microbial communities were compared at the phyla and genus levels so that the phylogenetic diversity and distributions of the microbial samples from the different wetland groups could be evaluated (Figs. 3 and 4). Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Euryarchaeota, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes were the dominant microbial populations at the phyla level in the both the control and treatment groups, and they accounted for 66.5–89.4 % of the total microbial community. Fig. 3 shows that Proteobacteria was the dominant microbial phyla and included most of the nitrogen removal microbes (Liu et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020), which, compared with the control, significantly decreased in the treatment groups by 45.5 % and 62.9 %, 39.6 % and 44.5 %, and 36.5 % and 46.7 % after long-term exposure to 10 and 1000 μg/L SWCNTs, MWCNTs, and C60,\nrespectively. These results indicated that CBNs, especially SWCNTs, have serious adverse impacts on Proteobacteria after 180-day exposure, and were in agreement with a previous study (Goyal et al., 2010), which reported that feeding active sludge with SWCNTs resulted in a decline in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, especially Gammaproteobacteria. In contrast, Hai et al. (2014) reported that 1 and 20 mg/L MWCNTs increased Proteobacteria abundance. This different conclusion was probably due to microbial community function and the structure differences between activated sludge and CW biofilm systems.\nFurther exploration at the genus level provided more detailed information on the functional microbial communities in the different treatment groups. The Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira are the dominant ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB), respectively (Guo et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2019), and are mainly responsible for the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate (Song et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2011). Fig. 4 shows that the presence of CBNs caused obvious declines in the relative abundances of Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira, which might be one of the main reasons for the deterioration in the ammonia oxidation process during long-term exposure to 10 and 1000 μg/L CBNs. The SWCNTs had the strongest biotoxicity toward AOB, followed by MWCNTs, and the inhibition level increased as the concentration rose. Differently, the relative abundances of Nitrospira and Nitrosomonas were quite high at the 10 μg/L and 1000 μg/L C60 treatment groups, respectively (Fig. 4). This results, on one hand, might be because that C60 had little impact on microbes in CWs, on the other hand these two microbes had been adapted to C60 (Tong et al., 2007). Thauera, Zoogloea, and Rhodobacter are known to play vital roles in the denitrification of wastewater, and the relative abundance of Thauera, Zoogloea, and Rhodobacter was less in the CBN treatments than that in the control treatment. These results may also explain the deterioration in the nitrate reduction process when CBNs are present.\nThe polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) Candidatus_Accumulibacter, and Pseudomonas are usually responsible for wastewater phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment systems (Stokholm-Bjerregaard et al., 2017). Fig. 4 shows that the relative abundance of PAOs (Candidatus_Accumulibacter, and Pseudomonas) in the treated groups was similar to that in the control, which was in accordance with the changes to wastewater phosphorus removal in our study. The effects of CBNs on functional microbial community structure in wastewater treatment systems have been previously reported by Hai\net al. (2014), who found that the presence of MWCNTs could alter the relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria and PAOs, and significantly lowered the nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies in SBR that had been exposed to 20 mg/L MWCNTs for 180 days. Additionally, Wu et al. (2019); Shrestha et al. (2013), and Tong et al. (2007) respectively reported that SWCNTs, MWCNTs, and C60 changed the structure of microbial community in soil system under exposure to different concentration and incubation time. However, it is difficult to compare the results from this study with the abovementioned studies because different CBN sizes (outer diameter) (Kang et al., 2008a) and types (absence versus presence of functional groups) (Kang et al., 2008b) in the various systems have different toxicities toward microbial activity. In this study, the results indicated that the presence of non-modified CBNs could significantly decrease the abundance of functional microbes relevant to nitrogen removal in the wetland microcosms, which was consistent with the lower nitrogen removal efficiency observed in the testing with different CBNs and exposure concentration."

      "heading" : "3.2.3. Responses of key enzyme activities in CWs exposed to CBNs",
      "text" : "In general, biological nutrient removal from wastewater in CWs depends on successful hydrolysis, nitrification, denitrification, and phosphorus transformations (Frolund et al., 1995; Vymazal, 2007). These processes are relevant to some key enzyme activities associated with nutrient removal (Yang et al., 2019b, 2018). Fig. 5 shows that the\nDHA (related to the bio-hydrolysis of organic compounds) and PST (related to the phosphorous transformation) activities were almost the same as in the control groups after 180-day exposure to 10 and 1000 μg/L of the three CBNs. The results were consistent with the change tendency for COD and TP concentration in the effluent. Similarly, Tong et al. (2007) also found that 6-months exposure to 40 μg/L C60 did not affect the DHA and PST activities in soil. However, previous studies have shown that SWCNTs and MWCNTs may considerably inhibit the enzyme activities associated with carbon (cellobiohydrolase, b-1,4glucosidase, b-1,4-xylosidase, etc.) and phosphorus (acid and alkaline phosphatase) conversion in soil exposed to high CBN concentrations (He et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2013). The reasons for the difference might be due to the low concentration of CBNs being fed into the system and the existence of wetland plants. The results implied that in CWs, enzyme activities related to COD and TP removal would not be affected under exposure to CBNs for at least six months.\nFigs. S5 and 5 show that the activities of key enzymes involved in nitrogen removal, such as Ur, AMO, and NAR, were clearly inhibited as the CBNs concentration rose. The three kinds of CBNs in the 10 μg/L treatment had no significant impacts on Ur (related to organic N transformation) activity, but the three 1000 μg/L CBN treatments did affect Ur activity. The C60 treatment led to 30 % inhibition, followed by MWCNTs (25 %) and SWCNTs (24 %) (Fig. S5). The ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) activity in nitrification process, as Fig. 5 shows, C60\ncaused the greatest inhibition (about 37 %), followed by the SWCNTs (18 %) and MWCNTs (21 %) in the 10 μg/L treatment. However, when exposed to 1000 μg/L CBNs, the strongest inhibition of AMO activity was observed in the MWCNT treatment, followed by C60 and SWCNTs. Prolonged exposure to CBNs also inhibited nitrate reductase (NAR) in denitrification process. The SWCNTs produced the greatest inhibition (about 35 % and 78 %, for 10 μg/L and 1000 μg/L respectively); the MWCNTs led to 14 % (10 μg/L) and 63 % (1000 μg/L) inhibition; and C60 led to 24 % and 51 % inhibition, respectively.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the Ur is responsible for changing organic nitrogen to ammonia. AMO and NAR are the key enzymes that catalyze the first step of nitrification and denitrification, and are also involved in the transformation of ammonia to hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and nitrate to nitrite (Morozkina and Zvyagilskaya, 2007; Yang et al., 2013). The above results indicated that the high concentration CBN treatments significantly inhibited Ur, AMO, and NAR activities. Su et al. (2015); Zheng et al. (2014b), and Auwerter et al. (2017) showed that nanoparticles inhibited microbial enzyme activities by attaching them to the surfaces of microbes. They also influenced the intra- or extracellular enzyme activities (Lead et al., 2018). In addition, numerous previous studies have also confirmed the negative effects of CBNs on microbial enzyme activities in different eco-system microcosms (e.g., activated sludge and soil). For example, Qian et al. (2018) reported that 10 μg/(g soil) SWCNTs caused a 40 % decrease in Ur activity after 30- days exposure. Su et al. (2015) and Zheng et al. (2014a) also found that the NAR activities decreased by 20–30 % when exposed to 10–50 mg/L SWCNTs that had been modified with -OH and -COOH in an SBR. Ma et al. (2019) and Hai et al. (2014) reported that AMO and nitrite oxidoreductase (NOR) activities in the nitrification process were repressed under long-term exposure to both MWCNTs-COOH and MWCNTs in activated sludge, which agreed with our results. In contrast, Hai et al. (2014) also found that long-term exposure to MWCNTs had no impact on the NAR activity during denitrification. Furthermore, Zheng et al.\n(2014a) analyzed the relative abundance of coding gene narG and found that SWCNTs-OH caused the down-regulation of narG gene abundance and then inhibited the expression of NAR. Tong et al. (2007) assessed enzyme activity related to the nutrient cycling of C, N, and P after 180-day exposure to C60 and found that 40 μg/L C60 can significantly repress urease activity in soil. This result also agreed with our findings. The CBNs disperse at the interface between gravels and the surface of biofilms when they are fed into CWs (Auwerter et al., 2017; Su et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2014b). Therefore, the biotoxicity of CBNs may be stronger toward enzymes on the periplasm and inlaying membrane, which might be one of the reasons for the diff ;erent CBN biotoxicities toward the various microbial enzymes in our study. Additionally, due to their excellent electron transport capability, CBNs distributed on the biofilm surface can promote electron transfer between microbes in a similar way to microbial nanotubes (Jiang et al., 2020; Takhistov, 2007; Zou et al., 2016), which may speed up the loss of electrons from the cell membrane and reduce the number of available electrons on the cell membrane. Finally, there may not be enough electrons to reduce the electron acceptors (NO3–-N and NO2–-N), which would lead to their accumulation and a decline in nitrogen removal efficiency."

      "text" : "As shown in Fig. 1, based on the analysis of nutrient removal efficiency, the presence of CBNs seriously inhibited nitrogen removal in CWs under long-term exposure. In this study, we also used PICRUSt to predict the metabolism profiling of bacterial nitrogen removal under various different CBN doses. This allowed us to analyze the responses of microbial nitrogen metabolism to CBN stress. The nearest sequenced taxon index (NSTI) for all the sequenced samples ranged from 0.185 to 0.240 (Table S1), which was consistent with the typical NSTI values for bacterial communities. Furthermore, the results showed moderate to fair function prediction accuracies (Langille et al., 2013; Wu et al.,\n2019). There are two major microbial nitrogen removal processes. One is nitrification, which needs amoABC and hao genes to express and transcribe the key enzyme proteins, AMO and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO), respectively; and the other is denitrification in which narG, nirK, norB, and nosZ express and transcribe NAR, NIR, NOR, and N2OR, respectively, to complete the reduction of NO3–-N to N2 (Yang et al., 2019b). Fig. 6 shows that the abundance of the functional genes and functional enzymes encoding genes (called as ‘enzyme abundance’ in below) during microbial nitrogen removal could be predicted and quantified. We found that both low and high concentrations of MWCNTs reduced the abundance of the hao gene. Furthermore, both low and high concentrations of SWCNTs induced nosZ abundance, and the low SWCNTs concentration significantly increased the abundance of hao, narG, nirK, and norB. Similarly, both the low and high concentrations of C60 up-regulated the nirK, and norB abundances, and nosZ abundance also increased under low level C60 exposure. For enzyme abundance, the SWCNTs significantly inhibited AMO, NAR, NIR, and NOR abundance, and AMO, NAR, and NOR abundance decreased as the MWCNTs concentration increased. Similarly, C60 also significantly reduced the abundance of the AMO, NAR, and NOR encoding genes.\nAll results were consistent with the inhibition of nitrogen removal efficiency caused by the decline in AMO and NAR activities when CBNs are present. Previous studies have shown that CBNs could wind themselves around the surface of microbial cells (Li et al., 2015; Su et al., 2015), and they also influenced the proliferation and expression of intracellular genes (Zheng et al., 2014a). Furthermore, enzyme proteins located on the cell membrane were more susceptible to the influence of CBNs, which meant that there was a greater decrease in enzyme abundance (Chung et al., 2011; He et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2013). Furthermore, Zheng et al. (2018) confirmed that functionalized SWCNTs modulated the key genes responsible for the glycerolipid/free fatty acid (GL/FFA) cycle, which disturbed the signaling process, energy homeostasis, intracellular redox balance, and transportation. These\ndisturbances also led to a reduction in denitrification efficiency. The above mentioned studies show that changes to functional gene and enzyme abundances under CBNs stress negatively affect metabolism activity and nutrient removal."

      "text" : "This study confirmed the impacts of CBNs on the treatment performance of CWs under 180-day exposure, especially on nitrogen removal (declined by 24.1 %–42.7 %). Among these CBNs, the MWCNTs posed the greatest threat to nitrogen removal in CWs under long-term exposure, followed by SWCNTs and C60. The detrimental effect could probably lead to reactive nitrogen input to nearby aquatic environment when effluent is below standard, potentially causing water eutrophication.\nCWs have received increasing attention over the recent years due to their decentralized and cost effective properties. Contaminants in CWs are mainly removed by the biofilms that cover the substrate, and in contrast to active sludge techniques, there is no sludge discharge process in CWs, which means that more CBNs can be retained by and accumulate in the biofilms in a similar way to other nanoparticles pollutants. Nitrogen-rich effluent from wetland microcosms exposed to CBNs might give rise to the eutrophication of receiving waters. CBNs’ accumulations negatively impact on ecosystem health, impairing microbe-driven element cycles (e.g., nitrogen, carbon and sulfur, etc.). Similar threat may happen on other environmental mediums, such as soil, river and lake, and even marine. Therefore, the observed results highlight the importance of CBNs control in wastewater. For this, we propose the two suggestions: (1) CBNs-containing wastewater from industrial raw material factories must meet standard criteria before discharging; (2) culture and improve the ability of biofilm or activated sludge to defend against nanotoxicity and treat wastewater containing CBNs."

      "text" : "The impacts of CBNs on nutrient removal in CWs were evaluated over a 180-day exposure period. The results showed that the presence of CBNs did not have any significant impacts on COD and TP removal, whereas the nitrogen removal process was markedly inhibited following long-term exposure to CBNs. Furthermore, chronic exposure to CBNs clearly caused an increase in ROS production, and then the increase of ROS reduced the abundance of several functional genes and enzymes involved in microbial nitrogen metabolism. Concurrently, the activities of key enzymes (Ur, AMO, and NAR), and the relative abundance of microbial community decomposers (nitrifiers and denitrifiers) significantly decreased. Finally, our data illustrated that chronic exposure to MWCNTs had the greatest negative impact on the nitrogen treatment performance of CWs, followed by SWCNTs and C60.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nXiangyu Yang: Writing - original draft, Methodology, Project administration.
