      "text" : "The local continuum theory fails to capture size effects in nanodevices, such as Nano-Electro-Mechanical Systems (NEMS) [1–3], and is not able to describe the behavior of structures characterized by an external overall length not much greater than material internal characteristic lengths. The scientific literature suggests various approaches (atomistic, strain gradient, Eringen nonlocal theory and so on) to be considered when the local continuum theory is inadequate, see e.g. Refs. [4–10] and references cited therein. In this paper, an innovative stress-driven nonlocal mixture is proposed for Timoshenko nano-beams. Such a model is combination of local and nonlocal elastic phases and differs from Eringen-like [11–14], strain gradient [15–19], couple stress models [20,21] and other approaches available in literature [22–30]. The need of the proposed stress-driven approach with mixture of local and nonlocal phases derives from a recent research [31] on behavior of the strain-driven nonlocal model for bounded nanostructures, where the bending field is expressed as convolution of elastic curvature with an averaging kernel assuming an exponential expression. The elastostatic problem, associated with such a strain-driven model, can be solved provided that the bending moment field satisfies suitable constitutive boundary conditions (CBC). This verification usually fails in cases of applicative interest, arising an ill-posedness of nonlocal\nproblems in nanomechanics. In order to overcome this difficulty, Romano and Barretta [32,33] proposed a stress-driven nonlocal integral model, where the bending field is placed in the proper position of input variable so that the constitutive law is evaluated by convolution between bending field and an averaging kernel. Strain-driven mixtures of local and nonlocal material laws are also considered in literature [34–40], wherein the local elastic fraction of the mixture induces wellposedness [31]. However, this beneficial effect does not hold for vanishing local fractions, see e.g. Ref. [41]. On the contrary, the stressdriven theory does not suffer the limiting behavior of strain-driven formulations as the local fraction tends to zero. The stress-driven model has been adopted in various problems such as bending of functionally graded nano-beams [42,43] and nonlocal thermoelastic behavior of nano-beams [44]. Such a model provides a stiffening structural behavior in accordance with experimental evidences [15,45].\nIn this paper, a stress-driven local-nonlocal mixture defined by convexly combining local and nonlocal phases is adopted and presented in Section 2. In Section 3, it is assumed that the kernel function appearing in the integral convolution is the special bi-exponential function proposed by Helmholtz. Under this assumption, the integral formulation in Section 2 is equivalent to a differential problem equipped with suitable constitutive boundary conditions.

In the proposed MstreDM for Timoshenko beams, the shear deformation is convex combination of local and nonlocal phases, with the nonlocal phase given by Romano-Barretta stress-driven integral law.

      "text" : "The procedures described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 provide closedform solutions for kinematic and static entities (such as v x( ), x( ), T x( ), etc.) of the Timoshenko nano-beam problem. Closed-form solutions v x( ) and x( ) have long expressions because contain the effects of both the flexural and shear deformations. This leads to represent the solution of the Timoshenko nano-beams by means of graphics in this section, avoiding the writing of long symbolic expressions for v x( ), x( ), etc. Closed-form solutions for some fundamental problems are obtained with the proposed methods and are reported in Appendix A. The following geometric dimensionless variables are introduced:\n= =x L L L , .c (30)\nIntegral equation (1) shows that kinematic variable x( ) is proportional to the external load contained in M x( ) and inversely proportional to the bending stiffness EI . Analogously from (2), kinematic variable =x x x( ) ( ) ( ) is proportional to the external load contained in T x( ) and inversely proportional to the shear stiffness GA. This allows adopting dimensionless kinematic variables for representing the solution of nano-beams. To this end, the shear stiffness GA is expressed in terms of the flexural stiffness EI by introducing the dimensionless ratio\n= GA L EI . 2\n(31)\nThe expression of the dimensionless transverse displacement v ( )* used to graphically represent the solution depends on the kind of load applied to the nano-beam and is given by\n=\n=\nv\nv x m\nv x F\nv x q x q\n( )\n( ) if a concentrated couple is applied,\n( ) if a transverse concentrated force is applied,\n( ) if a transverse uniform load ( ) is applied.\nEI mL EI FL EI qL y * 2 3 4\n(32)\nThe dimensionless displacements defined in (32) are usually adopted for beams subject to pure flexural deflection without shear deformation; but substituting =GA EI\nL2 in the closed-form expressions\nof v x( ), according to (31), displacements v ( )* defined in (32) also result dimensionless for beams exhibiting shear deformations in conformity with the Timoshenko model.\nIn the proposed nonlocal theory, the parameter λ plays an important role. Setting = 0 provides the classical local Timoshenko beam solution,1 which can also be recovered by solving the problem with = 1, whatever value of λ is adopted. Next, v ( )LT* denotes the dimensionless transverse displacement of the local Timoshenko beam (LT). The nonlocal Timoshenko beam (NLT) occurs when > 0 and 1. Another significant solution is obtained by setting + : the corresponding dimensionless displacement v ( )* is denoted by v ( )T* ; from (1) and (2), it results =v v( ) ( )T LT* * , see also Appendix Appendix A.\nThe stiffness ratio = GA LEI 2\ninfluences the magnitude of the flexural and shear deformations. As β tends to + the shear deformation tends to vanish with respect to the flexural deformation. Therefore, setting = + provides the Bernoulli-Euler beam, which is local (LBE) if = 0 and is nonlocal (NLBE) if > 0 and 1. The mixture stressdriven formulations for Bernoulli-Euler nano-beams has been treated in greater detail in Ref. [42]. Analogously to the Timoshenko beam, v ( )LBE* denotes the dimensionless transverse displacement of the local Bernoulli-Euler beam and =v v( ) ( )BE LBE* * denotes the dimensionless transverse displacement obtained by setting = + for the NLBE.\nFig. 2 shows dimensionless displacement v* against ξ for a cantilever subject to a transverse concentrated load at the free end point. The curves of the figure corresponding to the local and nonlocal Timoshenko beams are denoted by LT and NLT, respectively. In the same figure, the curves corresponding to local and nonlocal Bernoulli-Euler beams are also reported and denoted by LBE and NLBE, respectively. For nonlocal beams, the mixture parameter α is assumed equal to 0.5. For the Timoshenko beams, the stiffness ratio β is assumed equal to 4. The comparison between Timoshenko and Bernoulli-Euler beams in Fig. 2 highlights the increment of displacement v ( )* due to the shear deformation effect characterizing the Timoshenko model. The curves of the figure refer to several values of λ varying in the set\nS = +{0,0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, }. The parameter λ has the effect of reducing the displacement v ( )* , that is a larger λ involves a smaller displacement v ( )* for a given value of α. Therefore, v ( )T* and v ( )LT* [0,1] are lower and upper bounds, respectively, for the Timoshenko dimensionless displacement v ( )* corresponding to any\nS . An analogous observation holds for the Bernoulli-Euler beams. In the proposed mixture formulation, the transition from local to nonlocal models is governed by the parameter α. As the nonlocal model is stiffer than the local model, the parameter α has the effect of increasing the displacement v ( )* , that is a larger α involves a larger displacement v ( )* for a given value of λ. Figs. 3–10 show dimensionless displacement v* against ξ for different kinds of loads and boundary conditions. Table 1 shows the boundary conditions of the generic nanobeam considered in Figs. 2–10: specifically, the first column of the table reports the name of the nano-beam and the figure where the nano-beam is investigated; the second column of the table reports the corresponding boundary conditions.

In the same figures, the curves corresponding to local and nonlocal Bernoulli-Euler beams are denoted by LBE and NLBE, respectively. Moreover, the mixture parameter α is assumed equal to 0.5 for nonlocal beams and the stiffness ratio β is assumed equal to 4 for the Timoshenko beams. The considerations made for Fig. 2 are also valid for Figs. 3–4,6, 8-10. Specifically, v ( )T* and v ( )LT* [0,1] are lower and upper bounds, respectively, for the Timoshenko dimensionless displacement v ( )* corresponding to any\nS . An analogous observation holds for the Bernoulli-Euler beams. The closed-form expressions of the dimensionless transverse displacement v ( )T* are evaluated in Appendix A and are reported in Table 2 for the nano-beams considered in Figs. 2–10.

The model is a convex combination of local and nonlocal phases and circumvents some problems of ill-posedness emerged in strain-driven Eringenlike formulations for structures of nanotechnological interest. The nonlocal part of the mixture is the integral convolution between stress field and a bi-exponential averaging kernel function characterized by a scale parameter. The stress-driven mixture is equivalent to a differential problem equipped with constitutive boundary conditions involving bending and shear fields. Closed-form solutions of Timoshenko nano-beams for selected boundary and loading conditions are established by an effective analytical strategy. The numerical results exhibit a stiffening behavior in terms of scale parameter.",
