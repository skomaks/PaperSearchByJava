      "text" : "3604\nBACKGROUND: Shrimp is nowadays recognized as a rich source of proteins and omega-3 fatty acids. Edible nano-emulsion coatings containing eugenol, as an antioxidant agent, and Aloe vera, as a functional compound, were prepared for the storage of pink shrimp over 7 days at 277 K. Samples of the nano-emulsion were prepared under ultrasonication using 0, 10 and 20 g L−1 of Aloe vera as well as 0, 15 and 30 mL L−1 of eugenol along with Tween 80.\nRESULTS: Results indicated that the low pH of Aloe vera reduced that of the nano-emulsions while the particle size and turbidity increased with increasing Aloe vera concentration. Moreover, both colour and antioxidant activity of the nano-emulsions were significantly affected by eugenol and Aloe vera concentrations (p < 0.05). Increasing eugenol concentration led to increased nano-emulsion pickup but to reduced lightness. Higher concentrations of Aloe vera significantly (p < 0.05) decreased drip loss, cooking loss, pH rise and oxidation rates but enhanced hardness in the shrimp samples.\nCONCLUSIONS: The best results were recorded for the nano-emulsion coating containing 30 mL L−1 of eugenol and 20 g L−1 of Aloe vera. The nano-emulsion was successfully able to upgrade shrimp quality over 7 days of cold storage. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry\nKeywords: Aloe vera; edible coating; eugenol; nano-emulsion"

      "heading" : "INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Nowadays, seafood is attracting increasing attention among consumers because of its important nutritive compounds such as proteins and long-chain fatty acids. The two most important factors that affect consumer acceptance of foodstuff are quality and safety. Quality includes such organoleptic characteristics as appearance, odour, flavour and texture. Appearance is the first characteristic consumers note in their judgement of quality.\nAnother important consumer concern is the preservatives used in seafood; they obviously opt for products with less preservative use or none at all. While such traditional storage methods as refrigeration and freezing are able to extend seafood shelf-life, they cannot prevent quality deterioration through the cold storage period.1 It is therefore essential to develop new methods or techniques that can safely preserve the physicochemical properties and nutritional value of marine meat, especially that of shrimp. This should not only be regarded as a main concern but also a priority for the seafood industry.\nShrimp is an important seafood for its large nutrient content. Indeed, its quality is largely affected by its protein and free amino acid contents.2 Another important factor affecting shrimp quality is the presence of fatty acids as they might cause lipid oxidation. In fact, the products of lipid oxidation, such as peroxides, can change the organoleptic properties of shrimp.3 Shrimp meat is\noxidized and perishes as a result of exposure of the fatty acids to atmospheric oxygen. It is therefore essential for any novel technique developed to preserve shrimp quality by delaying its deterioration through inhibiting or retarding the rate of lipid oxidation in meat.1\nCoating is a century-old technique used to preserve food quality and reduce its moisture loss. Edible coating refers to coatings that comply with food standards and are safe for human consumption. Obviously, edible coatings must be appealing to consumers and, as some have claimed, they must be of nutritional value.4 In general, every food is subjected to at least one mass transfer process; these might include moisture transfer, oxygen release, flavour loss or migration of oils. A proper coating is one that protects food quality against environmental agents by creating a barrier against the transfer of moisture, oxygen, flavour, odour and oil.5 One important purpose of a coating is to limit oxidation.4\n∗ Correspondence to: N Soltanizadeh, Department of Food Science and Technology, College of Agriculture, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, 84156-83111, Iran. E-mail: soltanizadeh@cc.iut.ac.ir\nDepartment of Food Science and Technology, College of Agriculture, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran\nJ Sci Food Agric 2019; 99: 3604–3615 www.soci.org © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry\n3605\nOver the past few years, numerous studies have been conducted with the aims of producing edible coatings and evaluating their functions. Edible biopolymers (such as proteins, polysaccharides and lipids) along with food-grade additives have been used to produce edible coatings. Food additives serve to modify the physicochemical properties or other functionalities of coatings.6 This has encouraged a vast number of studies of the effects of different additive ingredients such as eugenol, oregano, Aloe vera, chitosan and gelatin to determine their protective impacts towards prolonged shrimp shelf-life.7–11\nEugenol is the main constituent of clove essential oil with such varied benefits as antioxidant, antimicrobial, antifungal and anticarcinogenic properties.12,13 Gülçin showed its powerful antioxidant activity.14 This compound is, however, associated with a disadvantageous strong flavour that might alter the original food flavour.15 In addition, the high hydrophobicity and reactivity of essential oils pose a formidable challenge against their direct incorporation in food products.16 To retain the biological activity of essential oils and to minimize their adverse effects on the organoleptic properties of foods, these compounds have been encapsulated in systems suitable for food application.17 For this purpose, nano-emulsions, which are easily dispersed in food products, have been used to minimize the effects of essential oils on food flavour while better diffusion and bioactivity are also achieved due to their subcellular size.18,19\nThe presence of proteins, polysaccharides or lipid matrices in edible coating formulations is a prerequisite to entrapping additives and active compounds. From among these, polysaccharides are the more attractive for application in edible coating formulations. Various polysaccharides such as chitosan, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,20 alginate21 and cassava starch22 have been used. Recently, Aloe vera has also been used as an edible coating in food products. The plant shows antidiabetic, anticancer and antifungal effects as well as wound-healing and gastro-protective properties, to name only some of its many health-promoting properties.23\nThe study presented here was designed and implemented: (i) to develop nano-emulsion edible coatings containing different concentrations of Aloe vera gel powder and eugenol, (ii) to evaluate the properties of the nano-emulsions thus produced and (iii) to investigate the effects of Aloe vera and eugenol edible coatings on the quality and oxidative stability of pink shrimp during its refrigerated storage."

As shown in Fig. 1, pH was significantly lower in nano-emulsions containing higher amounts of Aloe vera gel powder (p < 0.05). This was because the pH of Aloe vera gel powder was about 4.1, which decreased that of the nano-emulsions.

      "text" : "Among the unique characteristics of the nano-emulsions prepared are their rheological properties that are different from those of conventional emulsions containing the same amounts of oil due to the very small droplets present in the continuous phase. Increasing the viscosity of edible coatings is also important as it increases the coating pickup by any product. As shown in Fig. 2, Aloe vera concentration did not affect solution viscosity, but increasing eugenol concentration made significant and extreme changes in this parameter (p < 0.05). Along with certain properties of the soluble biopolymer that creates a continuous phase, several other factors such as the dispersed phase volume ratio, the rheology of the dispersed and continuous phases, particle size, colloidal interactions and particle surface electrostatic repulsion affect emulsion viscosity.27 Erramreddy and Ghosh showed that emulsifier concentration also affected nano-emulsion viscosity.28 It was observed in the present study that the amount of emulsifier increased with increasing eugenol concentration. At higher concentrations of the emulsifier, water molecules were trapped among emulsifier chains, which were then crosslinked and increased the ratio of viscosity to increased eugenol concentration.29"

      "heading" : "Particle size",
      "text" : "Results indicated that both Aloe vera and eugenol had significant effects on nano-emulsion particle size. According to Table 1, particle size increased in the absence of Aloe vera with increasing eugenol content. In this situation, about 60% of the droplets were less than 50 nm in diameter while about 36% were in the range 50–500 nm at a eugenol concentration of 15 mL L−1, and larger than 500 nm at a eugenol concentration of 30 mL L−1. A similar trend was observed in the presence of Aloe vera. It thus seems that particle size in the dispersed phase is proportional to the concentration of the emulsifier used. Generally speaking, average particle size decreases with increasing emulsifier content since more of the emulsifier is available to cover the surface of new particles created during the treatment. However, it was interesting to observe an opposite trend in this study in that particle size indeed increased with increasing emulsifier content of the emulsions. Previous\nresearch has shown that phase viscosity is capable of changing particle size. Increasing viscosity of the dispersed phase has been reported to cause particle deformation but not particle breakdown while also making it more difficult for the droplets to break up since it will take more time for the particles to break down when phase viscosity increases.30–33 As already mentioned, viscosity increased with increasing emulsifier concentration as a function of increasing eugenol concentration. At higher viscosities, however, the effects of ultrasound on eugenol droplets diminished such that eugenol droplets were deformed but not broken. As process duration in this study was constant, particle size increased with increasing eugenol concentration that also led to enhanced emulsifier content and emulsion viscosity. This is contrary to the case when eugenol was not present in the solution in which case increasing Aloe vera concentration caused a reduction in particle size. However, no droplets less than 50 nm in size were observed in these treatments. Thus, higher concentrations of Aloe vera seem to have increased the chances for the exposure of polymeric compounds to shock waves, which led to reduced particle size. Interestingly, in the presence of both Aloe vera and eugenol, droplets smaller than 50 nm grew larger in size, which could be attributed to the presence of eugenol. This complex interface may be explained by the droplets being covered with the polymeric compounds of Aloe vera. The radius of eugenol droplets is the sum of oil core radius and the interface thickness that can be determined from the size of the surface-active molecules. Such non-ionic surfactants as Tween 80 are small molecules adsorbed onto the oil–water interface of nano-emulsions. It would, however, not be strange to observe an increase in droplet size when larger molecules such as those of Aloe vera are added to a nano-emulsion.34 Pongsawatmanit et al. found that molecules of alginate were adsorbed onto a palm oil emulsion interface stabilized by a multilayer interface formed by \uD835\uDEFD-lactoglobulin.35 It is assumed that Tween 80 and Aloe vera polymers are simultaneously adsorbed on the surface of some droplets."

      "text" : "As evident from Table 2, Aloe vera and eugenol concentrations had significant effects on nano-emulsion colour (p < 0.05). Increasing either Aloe vera or eugenol concentration led to reduced nano-emulsion lightness. This is because emulsion lightness is a direct reflection of the particle size. In the case of eugenol, increasing its concentration increases particle size distribution and light scattering but reduces brightness. In the case of Aloe vera gel powder, the polymers in it are completely dissolved in water to induce light reflection and scattering upon collision with light rays, thereby reducing the nano-emulsion lightness with increasing Aloe vera concentration.\nAs evident from Table 2, in the absence of Aloe vera, the solution decreased in redness to turn more greenish with increasing eugenol concentration. In the presence of Aloe vera gel powder, however, a significant increase was observed in redness intensity with increasing eugenol content. This is while addition of Aloe vera gel powder to water (in the absence of eugenol) had little effect on redness intensity. It seems that the acidic pH of Aloe vera gel powder turns the yellow eugenol into red via changes in its phenolic compounds.\nYellowness was also studied in nano-emulsion coatings (Table 2), and it was found that increasing eugenol concentration invariably led to increasing yellowness intensity at each of the Aloe vera concentrations tested.

Moreover, the type of essential oil used seems to affect WI; there is evidence showing that using clove essential oil reportedly reduced WI.37 This explains why the lowest WI was observed with the treatment containing the highest eugenol content.

In nano-emulsions containing only Aloe vera gel powder, turbidity increased with increasing concentration of the coating ingredients that promoted more polymers to be present in the environment, giving rise to greater light scattering. Moreover, increasing eugenol concentration and the consequent increasing emulsifier content led to a significant increase in solution opacity. The larger particles produced at higher eugenol concentrations, however, seem to have contributed to increased light scattering and turbidity. Rao and McClements reported that lemon oil nano-emulsion turbidity increased in the presence of more essential oils.38 This increase in turbidity, which reduces the transparency of the coating seen as a visible layer, might have negative effects on product appearance, which obviously detracts from marketability.

Inhibition of lipid oxidation by eugenol is a two-step mechanism: (i) eugenol interferes with the trapping of active oxygen in chain reactions and (ii) it is metabolized to dimers (di-eugenol) that inhibit lipid oxidation during the progress of chain reactions.40 Developments in nanotechnology have made great contributions to enhancing the eugenol lipid oxidation inhibitory mechanism. As evident from Table 3, reducing particle size to the nanoscale enhanced the antioxidant activity of the solution containing Aloe vera gel powder by two to four times in the absence of eugenol. This is contrary to the expectation that reduced particle size cannot lead to any significant increase in antioxidant properties due to the high antioxidant activity of eugenol.\n0\n1.5\n3\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n2 1\n0\nBb Bb\nCa\nBa Ba\nBa\nAaAa Aa\nE ug\nen ol\nc on\nce nt\nra tio\nn (%\n)\nAloe vera concentration (%)\nP ic\nku p\n(% )\nFigure 4.

Based on Fig. 3, the treatments may be categorized into the following three groups: (i) that with the highest pH level during cold storage, which included shrimps treated with 0 g L−1 of Aloe vera; (ii) that with a pH level of about 7.5 on the first day of cold storage, which included shrimps coated with nano-emulsions containing 10 g L−1 of Aloe vera; and (iii) that with the least pH level during cold storage, which included shrimps coated with 20 g L−1 of Aloe vera. This is consistent with the pH values obtained for nano-emulsions used for coating. Enhanced Aloe vera concentration in the coatings reduced shrimp pH due to acidic pH of Aloe vera. Although the variations in pH during cold storage exhibited an increasing trend in all the treatments, the samples coated with emulsions containing 20 g L−1 of Aloe vera recorded the lowest pH values. The acidic pH of Aloe vera is important for its potential for inhibiting microbial growth.43,44 The highest pH values over the whole cold storage period were found for treatments with no Aloe vera. Jeon et al. stated that accumulation of nitrogenous alkaline compounds such as ammonia and trimethylamine, which result from microbial and intercellular enzyme activities during decomposition and putrefaction of fish, can be a cogent reason for rising pH levels throughout cold storage.45\nJ Sci Food Agric 2019; 99: 3604–3615 © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry wileyonlinelibrary.com/jsfa\n3610"

Despite the overall increase in drip loss observed during the whole storage period, the shrimp coating containing higher concentrations of eugenol and Aloe vera prevented much of the loss. The greatest drip loss over the 7-day cold storage was observed in the control sample, which reached 8.76% on the last day. The shrimps coated with a nano-emulsion containing 20 g L−1 of Aloe vera and 30 mL L−1 of eugenol, however, exhibited the lowest (2.89%) drip loss after 7 days. Generally speaking, hygroscopic attributes of Aloe vera were found to have a beneficial effect on the product’s water-holding capacity. In addition, the formation of a layer of eugenol on the shrimps also contributed to reduced drip loss during cold storage.9 Finally, water-holding capacity of the product was enhanced and its moisture loss prevented by the protein–polysaccharide complex formed due to the reaction of polysaccharide of Aloe vera with muscular protein of shrimp.46"

One characteristic of hydrocolloids is their water-holding property. Clearly, the presence of Aloe vera in coatings inhibits water loss due to its water-binding properties; hence, its higher concentration in coatings naturally leads to enhanced water-holding capacity and reduced weight loss of the coated product.

Although the treatments exhibited no significant differences in lightness at the beginning of the experiment, lightness decreased gradually in all the samples. This reduction was much greater in the case of uncoated samples on day 7 of the cold storage period (Table 4). A number of reasons may be claimed for this: (i) higher microbial growth on the surface of shrimps, which decreased lightness due to the formation of a thin surface layer, (ii) oxidation of pigments at the surface of shrimps that was faster in uncoated samples and (iii) formation of black spots in the control samples which were not observed in the coated ones because of the oxygen scavenging ability of eugenol intercepting direct contact between oxygen and shrimp tissue.48\nEvaluation of the a* parameter indicated that neither Aloe vera nor eugenol had significant effects on redness (Table 5). While the shrimps were relatively green on the surface, their colour remained stable through time with no change in a* values as a result of coating with the nano-emulsion. Moreover, examination of the b* parameter indicated that coating with nano-emulsions containing different Aloe vera and eugenol concentrations had no significant effects on yellowness. However, storage time made a significant difference. The results in Table 6 display the rising trend in b* value with increasing storage time."

      "heading" : "Texture analysis",
      "text" : "Figure 8 shows the results of texture analysis for hardness, springiness, cohesiveness and chewiness. Clearly, the samples increased in hardness with increasing concentrations of both ingredients (Fig. 8(a)). It seems that the phenolic compounds of eugenol reacted with protein fibres through covalent and noncovalent bonds to increase hardness so that higher concentrations of phenolic compounds led to higher hardness in shrimp. Aloe\nvera contains polysaccharide compounds; these give rise to protein–polysaccharide reactions that enhance hardness. As can be seen in Fig. 8(a), hardness increased in the treatments with no Aloe vera up to day 3 before it decreased on days 5 to 7. This is while samples containing Aloe vera in their coating maintained a rising trend in hardness up to the last day of cold storage.\nComparison of the variations in hardness and pH during the cold storage period reveals that treatments with lower Aloe vera concentrations had higher pH values that provided better conditions for microbial spoilage. It therefore seems that the proteolytic activity of microorganisms after 3 days of storage decreased hardness in shrimp tissues. Furthermore, the prevailing autolysis reactions in shrimp muscles reduced flesh firmness, which usually happens as a result of the enzymatic breakdown of muscle proteins.49 Post-mortem autolysis reactions begin in aquatic animals to soften their flesh and to reduce their textural elasticity.50 Clearly, both the materials used in this study for coating shrimps were able to delay the softening of shrimp texture during cold storage, especially during its initial days.\nAs shown in Fig. 8(b), eugenol concentration and storage time were also the factors involved in cohesiveness. Generally speaking, higher cohesiveness was associated with higher eugenol concentration. However, cohesiveness exhibited a decreasing trend in all the samples with increasing storage time up to day 5 when it showed a marked trend between days 5 and 7 (Fig. 8(b)). The autolysis reactions and the consequent reduction in intercellular connections in shrimp muscles decrease cohesiveness during cold storage. Finally, cohesiveness increased markedly on day 7 due to the disintegration of shrimp tissues.\nSpringiness was also found to be significantly affected by both eugenol concentration and storage time (p < 0.05); it indeed decreased in all the samples during storage at 277 K (Fig. 8(c)). Destruction of cellular structure and drip loss during cold storage led to reduced springiness, which in turn reduced texture resilience after compression. Higher eugenol concentrations enhanced springiness, which was attributed to the associated reduction in drip loss.\nNano-emulsion coatings had significant effects on chewiness (Fig. 8(d)). On the first day of storage, no differences were observed among the treatments; chewiness, however, declined in all the samples during storage at 277 K. The phenolic compounds of eugenol and the polysaccharides of Aloe vera seem to interact with shrimp proteins to influence chewiness."

      "heading" : "Analysis of TBARs",
      "text" : "According to Fig. 9, eugenol and Aloe vera concentrations had significant effects on TBARs. At the beginning of the storage period, similar values were recorded for TBARs in all the treatments; during cold storage, however, oxidation proceeded at different rates in the different treatments so that the control (uncoated) sample recorded a higher oxidation rate, rising from 0.69 to 1.17 mg kg−1. The lowest TBAR value after 7 days of storage was shown by shrimps coated with the nano-emulsion containing 20 g L−1 of Aloe vera and 30 mL L−1 of eugenol. Shrimp flesh is susceptible to oxidation because of its high concentration of unsaturated fatty acids, which results in a higher hydroperoxide content followed by an increase in the malondialdehyde content reflected in the rising value of TBARs.51 Aloe vera has a great antioxidant activity due to its compounds such as polysaccharides and flavonoids and was, thus, able in our case to prohibit to an acceptable extent the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. In addition, the coating containing Aloe vera limited the exposure of fatty acids to oxygen.9\nJ Sci Food Agric 2019; 99: 3604–3615 © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry wileyonlinelibrary.com/jsfa\n3612\nEugenol is also a plant extract with excellent antioxidant activity that is capable of preventing oxidation.14 It interferes with the trapping of active oxygen in chain reactions while it also metabolizes to dimers that inhibit lipid oxidation.40 Hence, when both Aloe vera and eugenol are used in nano-emulsion coatings, it is not far from expectation that they should offer a great potential for inhibiting oxidation."

      "text" : "The beneficial advantages of edible nano-emulsion coatings over typical coatings have made them suitable for coating foods with a high lipid content. The results of the present study revealed that the combination of Aloe vera gel powder and eugenol is suitable for use as an edible coating. In general, the nano-emulsion containing 20 g L−1 of Aloe vera gel powder and 30 mL L−1 of eugenol exhibited the lowest pH as well as the highest antioxidant activity and viscosity, all of which make this nano-emulsion a promising choice for food coating. The most important problem with this coating, however, is its opacity and the mild red colour that might change food colour and detract from its consumer appeal. Seafood, especially shrimp, contains such nutrient compounds as proteins and long-chain fatty acids, which are susceptible to environmental agents. A novel technology to preserve the quality of seafood, such as shrimp, is coating it with edible compounds. The present study showed that Aloe vera and eugenol nano-emulsions might have profound and desirable effects on retarding lipid oxidation. It was also shown that these nano-emulsions are capable of improving other qualitative parameters of seafood during cold storage. More specifically, it was found that they can decrease drip loss, colour changes and textural disintegration and deterioration, but increase the pH of\nwileyonlinelibrary.com/jsfa © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry J Sci Food Agric 2019; 99: 3604–3615\n3613\nTable 5.

Based on the results obtained, a direct relationship was established between the improvements gained in shrimp quality and the concentrations of eugenol and Aloe vera used in nano-emulsions. The best results of 67% reduction in drip loss and 48% decrease in cooking loss were obtained in the presence of 20 g L−1 of Aloe vera and 30 mL L−1 of eugenol. In addition, the amount of malondialdehyde reduced from 1.17 mg kg−1 in uncoated shrimp to 0.59 mg kg−1 in coated samples when 20 g L−1 of Aloe vera and 30 mL L−1 of eugenol were\nused. The nano-emulsions prepared in this study may, therefore, be recommended as a desirable coating not only to gain considerable improvements in shrimp quality but also to retard oxidative reactions in shrimp during 7 days of cold storage. It should be noted that natural compounds such as eugenol and Aloe vera can affect the sensory properties of shrimp. Hence, the effect of these compounds on sensory properties of coated shrimps alongside their antimicrobial properties must be considered in a future study."

    "abstractText" : "BACKGROUND: Shrimp is nowadays recognized as a rich source of proteins and omega-3 fatty acids. Edible nano-emulsion coatings containing eugenol, as an antioxidant agent, and Aloe vera, as a functional compound, were prepared for the storage of pink shrimp over 7 days at 277 K. Samples of the nano-emulsion were prepared under ultrasonication using 0, 10 and 20 g L−1 of Aloe vera as well as 0, 15 and 30 mL L−1 of eugenol along with Tween 80. RESULTS: Results indicated that the low pH of Aloe vera reduced that of the nano-emulsions while the particle size and turbidity increased with increasing Aloe vera concentration. Moreover, both colour and antioxidant activity of the nano-emulsions were significantly affected by eugenol and Aloe vera concentrations (p < 0.05). Increasing eugenol concentration led to increased nano-emulsion pickup but to reduced lightness. Higher concentrations of Aloe vera significantly (p < 0.05) decreased drip loss, cooking loss, pH rise and oxidation rates but enhanced hardness in the shrimp samples. CONCLUSIONS: The best results were recorded for the nano-emulsion coating containing 30 mL L−1 of eugenol and 20 g L−1 of Aloe vera. The nano-emulsion was successfully able to upgrade shrimp quality over 7 days of cold storage. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",
