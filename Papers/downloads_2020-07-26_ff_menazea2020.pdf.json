      "text" : "Polymeric films have attracted a great interesting with numerous potential utilizations including biomedical applications (Ahmed et al., 2019a, 2019b). The porous structure, controllable pore size volume and large surface to volume ratio and flexibility have suggested these films for tissue engineering applications such as wound dressing and drug delivery systems (Ahmed et al., 2019b; Mahmoudi and Simchi, 2017; Mansour et al., 2017a). The manipulation of porous structure is essentially for tissue applications because it provides a facile strategy to absorb proteins and to transfer oxygen and nutrients, further formation of vascularization (Wang et al., 2016; Mansour et al., 2018). However, successful biomedical materials should possess sufficient mechanical properties to be proper for the desired applications. Bending of polymers is considered to be a simple strategy to manipulate new composition with selective properties upon synthesis conditions (Sundaramahalingam et al., 2019). In this case, the chains of different polymers interact via hydrogen bonds or by Vander Walls force and the\nbehavior of the product depends strongly on their miscibility, viscosity ratio, melting trend in addition to the other components that may be added into the blend composition (Sundaramahalingam et al., 2019). Polyethylene oxide (PEO) is a semi-crystalline and linear polymer with monomer unit (CH2–CH2–O) (Sundaramahalingam et al., 2019; Kiran Kumar et al., 2011). The recurrence of ether group –O– gives PEO the ability to associate with wide range of metal cations or solvate (Morsi and Abdelghany, 2017; Kumar et al., 2014). It also possesses a great thermal stability, good reactivity besides its low glass transition temperature. So, it has an ability to form versatile composites through different solvents especially owing to its polar nature (Kumar et al., 2014; KK et al., 2012; Menazea, 2020a). Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)is an amorphous and cross-linked polymer and it contains carbonyl group (C]O) in its side chain, which facilitate composites formation with versatile inorganic salts (Naveen Kumar and Choi, 2019; Sundaramahalingam et al., 2018). Further, it is soluble in polar solvents such as; water and alcohol. In addition to this, it PVP attain great interesting due to its facile processability and moderate electrical\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.radphyschem.2020.108911 Received 16 January 2020; Received in revised form 11 March 2020; Accepted 3 April 2020\n∗ Corresponding author.

The hydrogen bonding between chains of both polymers is essential to develop the mixture properties; therefore, the blinding of PEO with PVP could enhance mechanical behaviors, electrochemical activity and chemical stability where the new composition should be better both of them lonely (KK et al., 2012; Sundaramahalingam et al., 2018; Abdelghany et al., 2016). Metallic nanoparticle–polymer composites have attracted highly interesting last decades due to the great properties that could be gained with these compositions due to the high surface to volume ratio in addition to conductivity or thermal stability upon the metals type (Abdelrazek et al., 2018; Abdelghany et al., 2016). Therefore, the incorporation of nano-particles through polymeric matrix may induce unique behaviors for the synthetic composite such as; novel electrical, optical, and structural properties. Among metallic oxides, copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) have attained considerable importance owing to its versatile applications starting from electrical reaching to biological one. This because its low cytoxicity, antibacterial behavior, biocompatibility (Kamal RajabiSohrabnezhad, 2019; Libalova et al., 2018; Norambuena et al., 2017). Different methods have been suggested to synthesize CuONPs, however Pulsed Laser Ablation in Liquids (PLAL) is considered to be most promising technique to obtain metal oxides nanoparticles from their metals in one step with high quality (Menazea et al., 2019a, 2019b, 2019c, 2019d; Menazea, 2019; Abd El-Kader et al., 2015; El-Kader et al., 2018). It provides high homogenous distribution in nanoparticles scattered through polymeric matrix.\nThis work aims to investigate the antibacterial behavior due to the modified PEO/PVP films with different content of CuONPs synthesized via pulsed laser ablation in addition to the structural morphological trends."

CuONPs@PEO/PVP composites were prepared by Laser Ablation Process with different concentration at different laser ablation time. Nd:YAG pulsed nanosecond laser that emits its fundamental wavelength (λ) at 1064 nm have been used as a source of ablation process. The laser source has 3.6 W powers, 10 Hz pulse repetition rate, 7 nm pulse duration. Copper metal plate (4 mm radius × 3 mm thickness) was polished with emery paper and washed several times in DIW. The copper plate was placed in the bottom of vessel filled with 20 ml of the previously prepared PEO/PVP (70/30 wt%) solution. The high of PEO/ PVP solution above the surface of copper target was about 7 mm. Convex lens with a focal length of 10 cm have been used for focusing the laser beam incident perpendicularly on the surface of copper plate to enable the laser ablation process. Five samples of CuONPs@PEO/ PVP composites were prepared with different concentration of CuONPs\nas mentioned in Table 1. The concentrations of CuONPs have been obtained by calculating the difference in mass of copper plate before and after ablation. The laser ablation process was repeated different times by different laser ablation time; (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 min). The synthesized CuONPs@PEO/PVP nanocomposite films have been performed via conventional solution casting technique; the solution of each laser ablation time was poured into polypropylene dishes and dried in the furnace at 40 °C for 5 days. After drying process, the prepared films at the bottom of dishes were stripped off from the dishes and placed in heavily evacuated desiccators to avoid the absorption of moisture. The thickness of prepared films was in the range of 0.1–0.3 mm. The flow chart of the synthesis procedure is displayed in Fig. 1."

      "text" : "Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of both Pure PEO and PVP with their pure blend. It could be seen that pure PEO possesses two high intensities peaks at 2θ = 19.26°, 23.65° and small peak at 26.30° which could be assigned to (120), (112) and (222) respectively (Naveen\nKumar and Choi, 2019; Menazea et al., 2020b).Those high intensity peaks confirm the semi-crystalline nature of PEO. On the other hand, PVP shows two broad peaks around 10.74° and 21.46°which indicate its amorphous nature. Fig. 2b displays XRD of blending PEO/PVP containing CuONPs. The crystalline nature that could be observed in the pattern could be referred to PEO contribution (Sundaramahalingam et al., 2019; Menazea et al., 2020c). The peaks at 2θ = 19.26° and 23.65° could be attributed to the peaks of (120) and (112) of PEO (Naveen Kumar and Choi, 2019; Menazea, 2020b). The observed peak at 2θ = 38.32° could be attributed to the formation of the plane of (111) belonging to CuONPs according to ICDD card no. 48–1548. It was crystallized in a monoclinic structure, and indexed according to the space group of (Pn-3m). There is no peak shift could be detected in case of blend PEO/PVP compared with their pure patterns. In addition, the variation of crystallinity could be assigned to the addition of CuONPs, and based on the blend owing to the fixation of blend ratio. The calculated crystallite size is reported in Fig. 3; it starts from 22.8 nm for the blend at zero content of CuONPs, while it jumps to be around 42.2 nm at the maximum ratio of CuONPs. This may indicate the enhancing of crystallinity owing to the addition of crystallite structure (CuONPs)."

      "heading" : "4.2. FTIR analysis",
      "text" : "FTIR spectra are illustrated in Fig. 4 and it was used to identify the functional groups of pure PEO, PVP and their blend. The band of 2884.2 cm−1 which appeared in PEO refers to the symmetric stretching of C–H, while the band of 929.9 cm−1 is assigned to the CH2 vibrational bending mode of PEO (Sundaramahalingam et al., 2018; Shoueir et al., 2019). A band of 839.2 cm−1is attributed to CH2rocking in PVP and\nalso refers to C–O stretching of PEO (Sundaramahalingam et al., 2018; Shaban et al., 2019). Concerning the small band of 1452.6 cm−1 that appears in PEO, it indicates scissoring mode of CH2 belongs to PEO (Sundaramahalingam et al., 2018; Elashmawi and Menazea, 2019). The band at 1278.6 cm−1 is assigned to the CH2 wagging or twisting of both PEO and PVP chains, while the band of 1074.0 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of C–N in PVP matrix (Sundaramahalingam et al., 2018; Samy et al., 2019; El-Shabasy et al., 2019). PEO tends to form a hydrogen bond with other polymers with high electro-negativity (Abdelghany et al., 2019a; Dawy and RifaatMenazea, 2015). On the other hand, polymers such as PVP possess ternary amide groups and good proton acceptors. Therefore, PEO/PVP blend is expected to be done via the interaction between C–H of CH2 belong to PEO with C]O of PVP. This procedure could be confirmed via the shift of C]O of PVP (1645.1 cm−1) which is accompany with the plunge of its intensity as well as the appearance of C–O–C band at 1098.2 cm−1 for the bending compositions (Abdelrazek et al., 2018). So, the presence of both ether at 1098.2 cm−1(C–O–C) and carbonyl (C]O) stretching of PVP (1634.1 cm−1) proves the miscibility between PEO/PVP blend (Abdelrazek et al., 2018). With increasing the content of CuONPs, it could be observed that the intensity of bands such as 2874.7, 1098.2 and 1645.1 cm−1 decrease which could be explained by supposing that Cu interacts strongly with C]O/C–O–C of blend PEO/PVP, which deteriorate the crystalline region of the blend via bonding distortion as matches well with results from XRD (Abdelrazek et al., 2018). The influence of CuONPs could be observed in terms of plunge of intensities and shift of bands that are coordinated with Cu ions. For instance, the formation of bands between Cu and ether oxygen atoms of PEO and the bond between Cu and carbonyl groups of PVP is noticed\nvia the shifts towards lower wavelengths as it could be suggested in Fig. 5. The intensities of 1098.2 cm−1 bands are lowering with increasing the CuONPs content through the blend compositions which is assigned to the coordination between CuONPs and ether group of PEO (Abdelrazek et al., 2018; Mansour et al., 2017c). The band of 728.0 cm−1 is assigned to C–N vibrational mode of PVP, and it is shifted to higher wavelengths with the addition of CuONPs due to the interaction of Cu+ ions with carbonyl bonds of PVP (Ragab et al., 2016; Mansour et al., 2016).The band of 1372.7 cm−1 is shifted to the lower frequencies after blending of PEO/PVP, and it refers to the asymmetric vibration of C–H through CH2 (Kiran Kumar et al., 2011; Ahmed et al., 2019c)."

      "text" : "Both particles distribution and shapes are visualized via TEM micrographs as seen in Fig. 6a-d. PEO/PVP blend was formed in sheet shapes. There is no pure polymer could be identified lonely which refers to the great miscibility. At t = 5.0 min of processing, CuONPs were scattered through PEO/PVP blend, and the nano particles look to be formed in spherical shapes with diameters around 50 nm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) which is set in Fig. 6b indicates that crystallinity is very low matching well with XRD results. Increasing the processing time of laser ablation to be t = 25 min, PEO/PVP sheets possess porous structure, while CuONPs are scattered through them with wide range of diameters around 10 nm reaching to 30 nm.\nFig. 7a-f shows the morphological features of different contents of CuONPs scattered via laser ablation technique through PEO/PVP blend matrix. It could be seen that the pure blend of PEO/PVP is formed as agglomerated sheets. It could not differentiate between the two kinds of polymers which refer to the good miscibility. In addition, micro-cracks are scattered randomly through the surface. Although these cracks may deteriorate mechanical properties of the blend polymer, they could enhance the biodegradation behavior of the composition further offering a way to transform nutrients through biological environment (Ahmed et al., 2014; Ramadan, 2019a, 2019b). Increasing the content of CuONPs at t = 15.0 min, the surface morphology is illustrated at Fig. 7c, d and it looks to be more smooth than the pure blend one. It could be noticed that there are micro-cracks through the surface besides low ratio of porosity. The highest content of CuONPs through the blend of PEO/PVP is seen to be porous surface covered by spherical shapes with diameters around 1–1.1 μm. These spheres refer to CuONPs. The surface roughness is shown in Fig. 8(a–c) while the roughness parameters are reported in Table 2. It could be notified that with increasing the contribution of CuONPs through the blend polymer, the average roughness (Ra) was enhanced from 26 nm to be around 37 nm at the highest contribution of CuONPs. The root mean square roughness (Rq) follows Ra, it increases from 35 nm at t = 0.0 min reaching to 52 nm at t = 25.0 min. The development of surface roughness may be assigned to the surface defects associated with the CuONPs embedded through the blend. This could introduce multimerits including improvement of biocompatibility towards host tissues\nand facilitating mechanical interlock between the blend polymers and targeted environment which could enhance the adhesion and encourage the healing process (Mansour et al., 2016, 2017c; Ahmed et al., 2014). Therefore, manipulation of surface roughness via controlling the embedded nanoparticles may introduce a facile strategy for configuration of a composition with desired behaviors to be accepted for versatile biological applications (Shoueir et al., 2020; Ateia et al., 2019)."

Therefore, the adhesion of E. coli and S. aureus towards the blend of PEO/PVP at different contents of CuONPs were tested. Upon Fig. 9, it could be noticed that with increase the content of CuONPs, antibacterial activity is induced against both E. coli and S. aureus. It is reported that at t = 5.0 the activity against E. coli does not exceed 24 ± 3%, while it reach to around 89 ± 4% at t = 25.0 min. On the other hand, the activity against S. aureus follows the former trend; it was around 18 ± 5% at t = 5.0 min, then it developed to be around 82 ± 3% at the highest content of CuONPs. It could be noticed that CuONPs were formed in a spherical shape; therefore high surface to volume ratio is expected to be obtained (Abdelghany et al., 2019b; Menazea et al., 2018). In addition, these spheres are scattered through PEO/PVP blend matrix which introduce high surface area for exposure (Mansour et al., 2020). Even the porous surface could facilitate releasing of nanoparticles into the bacterial agar (Ahmed et al., 2019d, 2020). Therefore, adjusting of CuONPs through the blend matrix could be a facile methodology to control antibacterial activity."

It is illustrated that surface morphology of the conducted films was function of CuONPs contribution. The pure blend matrix surface is full of micro-cracks, while the doped one with the highest content of nanoparticles was formed with a porous surface. The CuONPs were formed in spherical shapes with diameters around 1–1.1 μm.

The obtained films were characterized via XRD and FTIR. Their micro-structural features and morphological behaviors were investigated using TEM and FESEM. The CuONPs were formed in a spherical shapes with dimensions around 50 nm in case of processing time 5.0 min, while their size was deteriorated at t = 25.0 min to be around 30 nm upon TEM micrographs. In addition, surface roughness average was enhanced from 26.0 nm at no contribution of CuONPs reaching to 37.0 nm at the highest content. The composite films displayed antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus upon CuONPs contribution. The antibacterial activity jumped from no effect at no contribution of CuONPs to be around 89 ± 4% and 82 ± 3% against E. coli and S. aureus respectively at their highest contribution. Therefore, it could be seen that these films were carried out using facile method and displayed a great effectiveness through biological environment which could encourage more investigations for these compositions to be suggested for wound healing applications.",
