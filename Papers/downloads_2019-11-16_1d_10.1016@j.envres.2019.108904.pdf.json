      "text" : "1\nIn this study, the feasibility of using carbonaceous nanomaterials was explored for adsorptive 18 removal of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) dyes from contaminated water under 19 dark conditions. The morphology and crystalline nature of synthesized carbonaceous 20 nanomaterials (e.g., multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), activated carbon (AC), and 21 their nanocomposite) were characterized by different microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. 22 Furthermore, adsorption experiments were carried out by controlling several key parameters 23 including solution pH, adsorbent dosage, dye concentration, contact time, and temperature. First, 24 the adsorptive behavior of MWCNTs was explained with the aid of adsorption isotherms and 25 kinetics. Thereafter, the adsorptive performance of MWCNTs was compared with those of AC 26 and MWCNTs/AC, and the maximum adsorption capacity (mg/g) of MB/MO was in the order of 27 MWCNTs/AC nanocomposite (232.5/196.1) > MWCNTs (185.1/106.3) > AC (161.3/78.7). The 28\n2\nimproved adsorption performance (e.g., in terms of adsorption capacity and partition coefficient) 29 of the MWCNTs/AC nanocomposite could be attributed to the presence of more active sites on 30 its surface. Furthermore, their reusable efficiency was in the order of MWCNTs/AC 31 nanocomposite (90.2%), MWCNTs (81%), and AC (67%) after the first step of recovery. The 32 performance of these adsorbents was also evaluated for real field samples. In comparison to 33 MWCNTs and AC, the MWCNTs/AC sorbents offered excellent performance in both single and 34 binary systems, i.e., ~99.8% and 98.7% average removal of MB and MO, respectively. 35 36 Keywords: Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes, Methylene Blue, Methyl Orange, Adsorption, 37 Kinetics. 38\n39 40 1. Introduction 41 Potable water for living organisms is a serious issue worldwide as numerous anthropogenic 42 activities have resulted in contamination of water resources. Among different pollutants, the 43 evacuation of dyes into the environment is a matter of concern from toxicological and esthetical 44 viewpoints. Dyes contribute significantly to water pollution as colored effluents are released 45 from associated industries, e.g., the pulp, textile, tanning, and pharmaceutical industries, printing 46 factories, etc. Dye-contaminated water can intrude into the food cycle of living organisms to 47 cause phenotypic and genotypic disorders in humans, plants, and animals (Kumar et al., 2014a; 48 Kumar et al., 2014b; Kataria et al., 2016). Globally, more than 105 types of dyes are available 49 commercially, with an annual production of 7×105 tons (Hareesh et al., 2012). 50 Among the different dyes, methylene blue (MB) is commonly used in dyeing silk, cotton, and 51 wood. The consumption of MB-contaminated water was reported to cause severe health hazards 52 such as diarrhea, jaundice, restlessness, increased heart rate, vomiting, shock, quadriplegia, tissue 53 necrosis, and cyanosis (Saini et al., 2018). In addition, methyl orange (MO) is widely used as a 54\n3\npH indicator due to its water solubility. It may directly enter the human body by ingestion, 55 wherein intestinal microorganisms metabolize the azo dye into aromatic amines, leading to fatal 56 mutagenesis (Ghaedi et al., 2015). 57 The effluent containing dyes needs to be treated efficiently to overcome the detrimental 58 consequences in the environment and living beings. The degradation of dyes by natural 59 substances is not easy due to their high physicochemical, optical, and thermal properties (Yang et 60 al., 2018). A number of techniques (such as flocculation, coagulation, membrane separation, 61 adsorption, ozone treatment, and photo-catalysis) have been proposed for removal of dye 62 substances (Wang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018). Among these, adsorption remains a convincing 63 technique for eradication of dyes due to its eco-friendly nature, ease of operation, and low cost 64 (Saini et al., 2017). 65 Numerous forms of adsorbents have been investigated extensively, such as activated carbon 66 (AC) (Silva et al., 2018), metal oxides (Chen et al., 2016), polymers (Blanco et al., 2017), and 67 zeolites (Habiba et al., 2018). The extraordinary physicochemical properties and porous structure 68 of carbonaceous nanomaterials make them more attractive as adsorbents. Among these materials, 69 activated carbon (AC) has been used most abundantly as an adsorbent. However, the low 70 regeneration efficiency of AC puts limitations on its usage as an adsorbent. To solve this 71 limitation, enormous research efforts have been conducted to develop alternative adsorbents with 72 high reusability at low cost. 73 As an alternative, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are rolled up graphitic sheets that exhibit several 74 interesting properties in terms of hydrophobic nature, large specific surface area, hollow tube 75 structure, layer-by-layer arrangement, high porosity, and π-conjugative structures (Kumar et al., 76 2015). All these features make them an excellent adsorbent for various dyes, heavy metals, and 77 other organic contaminants (Kumar et al., 2014c; Sarkar et al., 2018). MWCNTs have already 78\n4\nbeen reported for adsorption of endocrine disruptors (i.e., 4-Tert-octylphenol), offering an 79 adsorption capacity of 270.27 µg/g at 35 °C (ALOthman et al., 2019). Moreover, the potential of 80 CNTs has been explored for the adsorption of heavy metal ions to confirm the enhanced 81 capabilities of CNTs under normal water situations (Ali, 2018). However, there are several 82 parameters that can affect the adsorption process and regeneration efficiency of CNTs, such as 83 morphology, active sites, and presence of defects. Therefore, research efforts have been directed 84 toward the optimal application of CNTs as an effective adsorbent either by diverse 85 functionalization (Keller et al., 2018) or through the formation of nanocomposites (Goscianska 86 and Ciesielczyk, 2019). 87 In this study, MB and MO were chosen as the target adsorbates as representative cationic 88 (basic) and anionic (acidic) dyes over carbonaceous materials, respectively. Three different 89 forms of carbon nanomaterials were used in this study including AC, multi-walled carbon 90 nanotubes (MWCNTs), and MWCNTs/AC nanocomposite. MWCNTs were synthesized by the 91 chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. The adsorptive removal of both MB and MO by 92 MWCNTs is interesting due to their porous nature. The performance of the adsorption process 93 by MWCNTs was evaluated in batch mode experiments with due consideration of different 94 variables, such as pH, adsorbent dose, adsorbate concentration, contact time, and temperature. 95 Different models of isotherms and kinetics were used to evaluate the adsorption capacity and the 96 associated mechanism. The comparative adsorption performance of the carbonaceous 97 nanomaterials was also examined in terms of their reusability and adsorptive capabilities in real 98 water samples. In this study, we made a step toward fully exploring the potential of carbon 99\nnanomaterials for quantitative adsorption of both cationic and anionic dyes. 100\n101 2.

The morphology of synthesized 127 MWCNTs was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (TECNAI 200 Kv TEM, 128 FEI Electron Optics, USA). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) (Quantachrome Nova, 2000e, 129 USA) technique was used to determine the surface area and pore size distribution of the samples. 130 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Shimadzu IR AFFINITY-I, Japan) was 131 employed to record the presence of functional groups on the surface of sorbent samples. The 132 structure of the samples was examined with the help of X-Ray diffraction (XRD) (PANalytical 133 X'Pert Pro Multipurpose Diffractometer powered by a Philips PW3040/60 X-ray generator, 134 Netherlands) with Cu Kα X-ray radiation scanned from 10˚ to 80˚. The salt addition method was 135 used to calculate the point of zero charge (pHpzc) of MWCNTs (Kataria and Garg, 2017). The 136 concentration of dye solution was examined using an UV-VIS spectrophotometer (UV-VIS 3000 137\n7\nLABINDIA, India) capable of UV-vis scanning from 190 to 1,100 nm. The dye concentrations 138 were measured at particular wavelengths, i.e., 664 nm for MB and 463 nm for MO. 139\n140\n143 2.2 Adsorption studies 144 All of the adsorption experiments were performed in batch mode. Adsorption experiments were 145 performed in conical flasks under absolute dark conditions in an orbital shaker with a speed of 146 180 rpm at 27 ˚C. Adjustments to the pH were made using 0.1 M HCl and NaOH solutions. The 147 effects of various parameters (e.g., pH, MWCNTs dose, time, dye concentration, and 148 temperature) on adsorption performance of the carbon-based nanomaterials were examined. The 149\n8\npercentage of dye removal and the adsorption capacity were calculated using the following 150 equations: 151 % = × 100 1 152\nand 153\n= ! − #\n2\nwhere Co and Ce are the initial and final dye concentration (mg/L). The amount of dye adsorbed 154 on the surface of MWCNTs with mass (g) at equilibrium in a given volume (L) of dye was 155 defined as qe (mg/g). Furthermore, the statistical validation of adsorption performance of all of 156 the adsorbents was confirmed using partition coefficient (PC) calculations. PC is the ratio of 157 adsorbate concentration onto an adsorbent solid surface to the adsorbate concentration in the 158 liquid phase in a solid/liquid interface (Nehra et al., 2019). It is a more objective performance 159 metric (e.g., relative to adsorption capacity) in that PC denotes the strength of solid 160 adsorbent/liquid adsorbate interactions by normalizing the effects of varying adsorbate inputs 161 between different studies. 162\n163 3. Results and discussion 164 3.1. Characterization of MWCNTs 165 The XRD patterns of MWCNTs, AC, and MWCNTs/AC are given in Fig. 2a. In the case of 166 MWCNTs, the main diffraction peaks corresponding to 2θ = 26.2°, 43°, and 44.6° resemble the 167 diffraction planes (002), (100), and (101), respectively, which confirm the graphite structure of 168 the MWCNTs. The obtained pattern matched the standard diffraction data for MWCNTs (Cao et 169 al., 2001). For AC, the main XRD diffraction peaks were observed at 2θ = 23° and 43° for the 170\n9\ndiffraction planes of (002) and (101), respectively. These XRD peaks confirmed the graphitic 171 crystallite phase of carbon. In the case of the MWCNTs/AC nanocomposite, the same XRD 172 peaks were recorded as those of MWCNTs, but at a lower intensity due to the presence of 173 amorphous AC (Wang et al., 2015). FTIR spectroscopy was an effective tool to examine the 174 functional groups present on the hexagonal structure of MWCNTs (refer to Fig. 2b). The wide 175 band at 3,427 cm-1 denoted the O-H stretching vibrations of the carboxylic acid group (Nguyen 176 et al., 2015). The peaks at 2,925 and 2,857 cm-1 could be assigned to the symmetric and 177 asymmetric stretching vibrations of C-H, respectively (Sayyah et al., 2015). The peaks at 1737, 178 1637, and 1544 cm-1 denoted C=O stretching (Atieh et al., 2010), and the peak at 676 cm-1 was 179 attributed to C-H stretching (Gurses et al., 2014). The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms 180 for MWCNTs and the MWCNTs/AC nanocomposite are plotted in Fig. 2c. The details of BET 181 surface area, pore size, and volumes of the synthesized MWCNTs and MWCNTs/AC are listed 182 in Table 2. The BET surface area and pore size distribution details of AC are available elsewhere 183 (Suresh et al., 2012). The addition of AC into MWCNTs increased the surface area through 184 addition of extra active sites (Birch et al., 2013; Mojoudi et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2014). 185\n186\n10\n187\n11\n191\n192\nTable 2 193 Surface properties of synthesized MWCNTs and MWCNTs/AC 194 Order Parameters Values for\nMWCNTs\nValues for\nMWCNTs/AC\n1 BET Surface Area 638.135 m2/g 1,021.154 m2/g\n2 Total Pore Volume Summary Pore volume\n5.982 cm3/g\n6.587 cm3/g\n3 BJH Desorption Summary Surface area Pore volume Pore diameters\n89.338 m2/g 0.318 cm3/g 3.8 nm\n100.698 m2/g 0.197 cm3/g 3.8 nm\n4 Average Pore Size Summary Average pore diameter\n3.7 nm\n2.5 nm\n195\n196 The SEM technique was utilized to examine surface morphology of synthesized MWCNTs at a 197 scale of 20 µm and 200 nm (Fig. 3a & b). The surface view of MWCNTs clearly indicated their 198 formation in the form of nanotubes piled over one another. Figures 3c & d show the SEM 199 imaging of composite MWCNTs/AC at a scale of 100 nm and 200 nm. The elemental 200 composition of MWCNTs and MWCNTs/AC was confirmed by EDX spectrum (refer to Fig. 3e 201 & f). The clear and differentiating formation of MWCNTs was confirmed by TEM (Fig. 4a & b). 202\nThe magnified images of MWCNTs at 38000X indicate that the synthesized MWCNTs have a 203 width of ~5-20 nm and a length of several micrometers. 204\n205\n206\n207\n13\n216 3.2 Adsorption experiment 217 The point of zero charge (PZC) calculations are critical to understand the behavior of 218 adsorbents in terms of anion or cation exchangers. The pHpzc value of synthesized MWCNTs was 219 6, confirming that the positive charge-acquired surface of MWCNTs was at a pH < pHpzc, while 220 a negatively charged surface was at a pH > pHpzc. The pHpzc value of synthesized MWCNTs, 221\n14\nAC and MWCNTs/AC were found to be 6, 5.25 and 5 (refer to Fig. 5). Therefore, the surface of 222 MWCNTs, AC and MWCNTs/AC acquired positive charge at pH < pHpzc and negative charge 223 at pH > pHpzc. 224\n227 3.2.1. Effects of pH 228\nAdsorption of dye depends significantly upon the pH of the dye solution. A change in the pH 229 affects (a) the degree of ionization of the solution, (b) the charge on tfhe hexagonal structure of 230 MWCNTs, and (c) the specifications of the adsorbates. The pH of the solution was controlled in 231 a range from 2-10 when the experiments were conducted with the following conditions: 50 mL 232 dye solution (10 mg/L), 0.01 g adsorbent dose, 10 mg/L adsorbate concentration, 27 oC 233\n15\ntemperature, and 120 min contact time. The percentage of dye removal increased from 31% to 234 83% for MB with change in pH from 2 to 10 (Fig. 6a). On the other hand, the percentage 235 removal of MO decreased from 67.4% to 13% with pH change from 4.5 to 10, as can be seen in 236 Fig. 6a. The adsorption of MO dye also decreased to 32% in strong acidic conditions (pH 2). 237 This was due to the contrasting degree of ionization, charge on the adsorbent, and the nature of 238 the adsorbate under different pH conditions. At pH > pHpzc, the surface of MWCNTs contained a 239 negative charge. The presence of COOH¯ and OH¯ groups supported the favorable adsorption of 240 cationic dyes over anionic dyes. On the other hand, the surface of MWCNTs had a positive 241 charge (H+ and H3O +) at pH < pHpzc to facilitate the adsorption of anionic dyes. Therefore, the 242 maximum removal of MB dye was achieved at a higher pH due to enhanced affinity of the 243 negatively charged surface of the adsorbent for cationic dyes through favorable electrostatic 244 interactions (Gurses et al., 2014). The acidic pH of the solution hindered the adsorption of MB 245 mainly due to the excess H+ ions. These H+ ions competed with MB cations for the adsorption 246 sites that were available over the adsorbent surface. In the context of MO dye, a maximum of 247\n67.4% removal was achieved at pH 4.5. At higher pH levels, the presence of OH⁻ ions in the 248\nsolution as well as on the surface of MWCNTs competed with the MO molecules (Mahmoodian 249 et al., 2014). In strong acidic conditions, the adsorption of MO dye decreased, confirmed by the 250 color change in dye solution from orange to red. 251\n3.2.2. Effects of MWCNTs dose 252\nFrom an economical point of view, the effective dose of MWCNTs should be low enough to 253 remove adsorbate from the aqueous solution. Figure 6b shows the effects of MWCNTs dose on 254 removal of MB and MO at 27 oC, 50 mL dye solution (10 mg/L), stirring speed of 180 rpm, time 255 of 120 min, and pH 8 (for MB) or pH 4.5 (for MO). These pH values correspond to the 256\n16\nmaximum adsorption capacity of MWCNTs, as seen in Fig. 6a. An increase in percentage of dye 257 removal was observed with an increase in the amount of MWCNTs in the dosage range of 5 to 258 25 mg. The large amount of MWCNTs confirmed the presence of more active sites on the 259 hexagonal structure of MWCNTs for adsorption. The increment in adsorbent dosage beyond a 260 certain limit could decrease the adsorption capacity by blockage or overlap of active sites due to 261 agglomeration of MWCNTs (Liu et al., 2012; Saleh and Gupta et al., 2012). In the batch 262 experiments, dye removal was found to be almost constant after a 10 mg dosage of MWCNTs. 263 This dosage of 10 mg was thus selected for further batch experiments. 264\n2 4 6 8 10 0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nMB MO\nD ye\nr em\nov al\n( %\n)\npH\na)\n0.000 0.005 0.010 0.015 0.020 0.025\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100b)\nD ye\nr em\nov al\n( %\n)\nAdsorbent dose (g/50mL)\nMB MO\n265\n0 10 20 30 40 50 0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100c)\nDye Conc.

Effects of adsorbate concentration 271\nThe effects of adsorbate concentration for both MB and MO were examined from 5 to 50 mg/L, 272 while keeping the other experimental parameters constant (i.e., MWCNTs dose of 0.01 g, 273 temperature of 27 o C, contact time of 120 min, stirring speed of 180 rpm, pH of 8 for MB, and 274 pH of 4.5 for MO). There was a significant decrease in percentage removal of MB (from 84 to 275 57%) and MO (from 78 to 38%) with increase in dye concentration from 5 to 50 mg/L (refer to 276 Fig. 6c). For a lower adsorbate concentration (5 mg/L), the fixed amount of adsorbent (0.01 g) 277 offered more binding affinity toward adsorbate, thereby resulting in higher percentage removal 278 of dyes, i.e., 84% for MB and 78% for MO. On the other hand, at a higher adsorbate 279 concentration (50 mg/L), adsorbate molecules saturated the binding sites on the adsorbent (of the 280 fixed amount of 0.01 g) surface; thereby resulting in a decreased percentage removal of dyes, 281 i.e., 57% for MB and 38% for MO. 282\n18\n283\n3.2.4. Effects of contact time 284\nAdsorption experiments were also performed by changing the contact time from 15 to 180 min 285 with the other parameters remaining constant. Both dyes showed a gradual increase in percentage 286 removal with an increase in contact time from 15 to 180 min. The percentage of dye removal for 287 MB and MO increased from 51 to 83% and 36 to 70%, respectively (refer to Fig. 6d). A fast 288 increase in dye adsorption was observed in the beginning of the experiment due to the presence 289 of numerous free active sites on the surface of the MWCNTs. With the progression of time, 290 adsorption slowed with saturation of active sites to attain near-equilibrium conditions 291 (Mahmoodian et al., 2014; Duman et al., 2016). 292\n293\n3.2.5. Effects of temperature 294\nThe dye adsorption performance was also evaluated as a function of temperature in the range of 295 17 to 57 oC. MWCNTs showed an increase in percentage removal with an elevation in 296 temperature (Fig. 6e). It was evident that the process of adsorption for both dyes was 297 endothermic in nature. With a rise in temperature, the mobility and diffusion of the dye 298 molecules in solution increased as the interaction of adsorbate molecules with the active sites of 299 the adsorbent increased simultaneously (Ma et al., 2014). Therefore, maximum adsorption (i.e., 300 ~86% for MO and ~97% for MB) was observed at a higher temperature (57 oC). All experiments 301 were performed in closed vessels. 302\n303\n19\n3.3 Adsorption isotherms 304\nAn adsorption isotherm explains the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent. With due 305 consideration of MWCNTs as adsorbents, Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin adsorption models 306 were employed to explain the adsorption behavior of MWCNTs for both MB and MO dyes. 307 Later, the adsorption behavior of MWCNTs was also compared with those of AC and the 308 composite, as detailed in section 3.7. The Langmuir adsorption model explained monolayer 309 adsorption of the dye molecules on a homogeneous surface of MWCNTs on active sites (Kataria 310 et al., 2016). A linear form of the Langmuir isotherm is given as follows: 311\n= 1 %&'( + %&' 3\nwhere ( is the Langmuir constant to explain the affinity of binding sites (L/mg), and qmax is the 312 maximum adsorption capacity for monolayer adsorption (mg/g). The linear plot between 313 ⁄ vs. helped in calculation of the adsorption model parameters for both the MB and MO 314 dyes (Fig. 7a). The values of qmax, b, the correlation coefficient (R 2), and the separation factor 315 (RL) for MB and MO are given in Table 3. 316 317 RL can be calculated as follows: 318\n,- = 11 + ( . 4\nwhere ( denotes the Langmuir constant, and the Langmuir adsorption model is favorable for 0 319 <RL <1. Furthermore, the Freundlich isotherm model explained the multilayer adsorption of 320 adsorbate molecules onto the MWCNTs active surface (Fig. 7b). Multiple layer adsorption 321 occurred due to the heterogeneous nature of active sites available on the surface of MWCNTs 322 (Wang et al., 2018). A linear form of the Freundlich isotherm can be expressed as follows: 323\n0 = 012 + 1 0 5\n20\nwhere 12 is the Freundlich constant related to the adsorption capacity [mg/g. (L/mg)1/n], and is 324 the heterogeneity factor related to the adsorption intensity. The Freundlich adsorption model was 325 favorable when 1< n <10 (Table 3). 326\n21\n22\nwhere B = RT/b, R is the universal gas constant (i.e., 8.314), T is the temperature, b is the 343 Temkin constant expressing the heat of adsorption (J/mol), and 15 is the equilibrium binding 344 constant (L/g). The adsorption parameters were evaluated from the linear plot of vs. 345 (refer to Fig. 7c). 346\nUpon comparing the adsorption isotherms, the Langmuir model was best fitted for MB dye 347 adsorption, with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.995. The maximum adsorption capacity of 348\n23\nMB was 185.1 mg/g through monolayer adsorption of basic dye molecules on the homogeneous 349 active sites of MWCNTs (Pathania et al., 2017). On the other hand, the Freundlich model was 350 the best fit for MO dye adsorption, with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.987. This result 351 suggests multilayer adsorption of MO on heterogeneous active sites of MWCNTs (Yan et al., 352 2016). 353\n354\n3.4 Adsorption kinetics 355\nTo determine the rate of adsorption onto MWCNTs, Lagergren first order equation, pseudo-356 second order equation, and intra-particle diffusion equation were applied to the obtained 357 practical data. The linear form of the Lagergren model with the first order and pseudo-second 358 order can be expressed as follows (Yagub et al., 2014; Ho and McKay, 1999): 359\nlog − ; = 0 − < =>2.303@ 7\n; = 1 =B B +\n8\nwhere ; denotes the adsorption capacity at time t (mg/g), => denotes the pseudo-first order 360 kinetic rate constant (min-1), and =B denotes the pseudo-second order kinetic rate constant (g mg-1 361 min-1). In the pseudo-first order model, the values of => and of both MB and MO dyes were 362 determined by plotting the graph between log − ; versus (refer to Fig. 8a). Similarly, in 363 the pseudo-second order model, the values of =B and for the dyes (MB and MO) were 364 calculated via the linear plot between ;⁄ versus (Fig. 8b and Table 4). 365\n24\n25\nThe values obtained from different kinetic models confirmed that the values were best 371 fit with the exp values obtained from the pseudo-second order kinetic model (refer to Table 372 4). The pseudo-second order model significantly favored adsorption of both MB and MO dyes, 373 with higher correlation coefficients of R2 ≥ 0.9984 and 0.9988, respectively (Yagub et al., 2014). 374\nwhere ; denotes the equilibrium dye uptake at time t (mg/g), =JK denotes the intra-particle 381 diffusion rate constant (mg g-1min-1/2), and denotes the intercept showing the thickness of the 382 boundary layer effect (mg/g). The values of =JK and for both dyes (MB and MO) were 383 calculated by plotting a graph between ; and =JK (refer to Fig. 8c). Intra-particle diffusion was 384 only a rate controlling step where the plot did not pass through the origin ( ≠0) (Kataria and 385\n26\nGarg, 2018a,b). The correlation coefficient (R2) values of both MB and MO dyes for the intra-386 particle diffusion model were slightly lower than those of the pseudo-second order model (< 387 0.9718 and 0.9262, respectively) (refer to Table 4). Based on comparison of the correlation 388 coefficient values of all of the models, it was clear that the pseudo-second order model was 389 better suited for adsorption of MB and MO dyes onto MWCNTs than the pseudo-first order 390 kinetic model and intra-particle diffusion model. 391\n3.5. Thermodynamic study 392\nBatch experiments were performed at varying temperatures (17-57 ˚C) with other parameters 393 kept constant to elaborate the effects of temperature on adsorption of both dyes. The Van't Hoff 394 equation was used to evaluate entropy (MNO), enthalpy (MPO), and change in Gibb’s free 395 energy MQO as follows: 396\nMQO = −,R 1K 10\n1K = & 11\nMQO = MPO– RMNO 12\n1K = MP O ,R – MNO , 13\nwhere MQO is the change in Gibb's free energy (kJ mol-1), , is the gas constant (8.314 J mol-1 K-397 1), R is the temperature (K), 1K is the equilibrium constant, and & is the amount of dye 398 concentration on the adsorbent (mg/L). 399\nThe plot of 1K versus 1 R⁄ was helpful to evaluate the values of MPO and MNO as shown in 400 Table 5. The negative value of MQO for both dyes showed that the adsorption process was 401\n27\nspontaneous; for example, adsorption increased with a rise in temperature. The positive value of 402 MPOconfirmed the endothermic nature of the adsorption process, while the positive value of 403 MNO indicated the affinity of MWCNTs toward both MB and MO dyes (Pathania et al., 2017). 404\nIn general, adsorption depended on the pH of the solution and the surface properties of 411 MWCNTs. The mechanism of dye adsorption involved interaction between the adsorbate and 412 adsorbent in the solution. This interaction may have occurred in the following ways: electrostatic 413 bonding, ᴨ-ᴨ bonding, and hydrogen bonding. Carbon nanotubes are hollow tubes with 414 hexagonally arranged carbon atoms with sp2 hybridization, offering ᴨ-ᴨ bonding between the 415 side wall of MWCNTs and C=C bond of dye molecules. Hydrogen bonding mainly occurred 416 between the dyes and MWCNTs due to the presence of hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amide groups on 417\n28\nMWCNTs. Electrostatic bonding occurred between the negatively charged surface of MWCNTs 418 and MB dye molecules at higher pH (Gupta et al., 2013). The anionic groups of MO dye 419 molecules were electrostatically attracted to the positive hydronium group on the surface of the 420 MWCNTs. The interactions between both of the dyes and the MWCNTs are schematically 421 drawn in Fig. 9. 422\n426\n3.7. Comparative adsorption study with other adsorbents 427\n29\nFor both dyes (MB and MO), activated carbon (AC) and MWCNT/AC were also used to 428 describe their adsorptive behavior across varying concentrations of dyes (e.g., 5 to 50 ppm). 429 Adsorption of MB over AC was found to be equivalent to that of MWCNTs, whereas adsorption 430 of MO over AC was not. Therefore, it was concluded that MWCNTs offered higher adsorption 431 for both of the dyes than AC (i.e., 161.3 mg/g for MB and 78.7 mg/g for MO) due to their 432 structure being favorable for inducing a stronger interaction with adsorbate molecules. With the 433 use of MWCNT/AC, much higher levels of adsorption were achieved for MB and MO, 232.5 434 mg/g and 196.1 mg/g, respectively. At fixed concentrations of MWCNTs and nanocomposites 435 (0.01 g) for 10 ppm dye solutions, the MWCNTs/AC nanocomposite offered 100% removal of 436 MB dye in comparison to 81% removal using MWCNTs. Similarly, the percentage removal of 437 MO (10 ppm) increased from 67 to 100% with the use of MWCNT/AC nanocomposite over 438 MWCNTs. The FTIR spectra for different adsorbents (i.e. AC, MWCNT, MWCNT/AC) were 439 also recorded after MB and MO adsorption and are shown in Figure 1S (Supplementary 440 Information). Figure 10 depicts the comparative adsorption capacity of MB and MO dyes with 441 MWCNT, AC, and MWCNT/AC. 442\n30\n31\ncontact time, and temperature has been elucidated in Figure 3S (Supplementary Information). 449 The different adsorption isotherms as applicable to these experimental observations have been 450 depicted in Figure 4S (Supplementary Information). The values obtained from different kinetics 451 model for making comparative analysis of carbonaceous materials are shown in Figure 5S 452 (Supplementary Information) and the related data are presented in Table 1S and 2S 453 (Supplementary Information). 454\n3.8. Reusability 455\nThe reusability of adsorbents (i.e., MWCNTs, AC, and MWCNTs/AC) for MB and MO dyes 456 over successive cycles was investigated. First, MWCNTs, AC, and MWCNTs/AC were collected 457 from aqueous solution left over after adsorption experiments. They were then subjected to 458 repetitive washing with ethanol and double distilled water and dried in an oven at 100 ˚C. The 459 dried adsorbents were used again for batch mode experiments of MB and MO dye removal at 460 optimized conditions, such as dye concentration 10 mg/L, dose 0.01 g, time 120 min, 461 temperature 27 ˚C, 180 rpm, and optimum pH 4.5 (MO) and 8 (MB). Such tests were conducted 462 for a total of five cycles against both dyes. Remarkable results were observed for both of the 463 dyes in comparison to the data reported in the existing literature (Gupta et al., 2013). Reusability 464 of MWCNTs/AC and MWCNTs makes them better candidates for dye removal compared to AC 465 with low reusability (Fig. 11). 466\n32\n467\n468\n33\n469\nFig. 11. Reusability of MWCNTs, AC, and MWCNTs/AC for MB and MO removal. 470\n3.9. Adsorption efficiency in real water systems 471\nThe standard dye solutions were prepared in single and binary systems using GW, TW, and 472 DW. MWCNT and AC were equally efficient for MB removal in all samples, while MWCNT 473 was more efficient for MO removal. In comparison to CNT and AC, the MWCNT/AC composite 474 offered enhanced removal efficiency for both dyes, whether it was a single or binary system 475 (refer to Fig. 12). 476\n34\n477\nFig. 12. Dye adsorption efficiency of carbonaceous nanomaterials in real water samples: (a) and 478 (c) for MB dye for GW, TW, and DW systems spiked with single and binary components; (b) 479 and (d) for the MO dye counterparts of (a) and (c), respectively. 480\n4. Role of partition coefficient in the present work 481\nThe adsorption performance of the carbonaceous nanomaterials was compared to that in 482 existing literature in terms of adsorption capacity (refer to Table 6). However, the adsorption 483 capacity of adsorbents varied with a change in optimum operating conditions. For instance, the 484 adsorption capacity increased with an increase in the initial concentration of dyes. Therefore, 485 there was a need for true practical performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of 486 adsorbents for removal of MB and MO dyes. The partition coefficient can offer significant 487\npractical basis to explore the actual performance of the adsorbents regardless of alteration in 488 optimum conditions. The partition coefficients in the existing literature and present work are 489 compared in Table 6. 490\n36\n11 MWCNTs\nMethylene blue Methyl orange\n185.1 106.3\n21.65 31.19\n27, 8 27, 4.5\n2.09 0.99\nPresent work\n12 AC Methylene blue\nMethyl orange\n161.3 78.7\n21.01 38.01\n27, 8 27, 4.5\n2.21 0.48\nPresent work\n13 MWCNTs/AC Methylene blue\nMethyl orange\n232.5 196.1\n3.8 11.78\n27, 8 27, 4.5\n19.58 5.31\nPresent work\n494\n4.1 Conclusion 495\nIn summary, the performance of carbonaceous materials were evaluated for removal of MB and 496 MO dyes using batch mode experiments. Langmuir isotherm and Freundlich isotherm models 497 were best fit for MWCNTs to MB and MO, respectively. These isotherms confirmed the 498 monolayer adsorption of MB dye onto the homogenous active sites of MWCNTs. On the other 499 hand, multilayer adsorption of MO dye occurred on the heterogeneous surface of MWCNTs. The 500 adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic in nature, as confirmed by thermodynamic 501 study. The rate of adsorption for both MB and MO dyes was in good agreement with the pseudo-502 second order model. The carbonaceous nanomaterials offered the maximum adsorption capacity 503 in the order of MWCNTs/AC ˃MWCNTs ˃AC for MB and MO, respectively. The adsorption 504 capacity values (mg/g) of MB by MWCNTs (185.1), AC (161.3), and MWCNTs/AC (232.5) 505 were larger than those of MO (106.3, 78.7, and 196.1 mg/g, respectively). These observations 506 could be attributed to the cationic exchange capacity of the adsorbents. In addition, MWCNT/AC 507 recorded the best performance for MB and MO dye adsorption in terms of partition coefficients 508 of 19.58 and 5.31 mg.g-1.µM-1, respectively. Reusability experiments illustrated that MWCNTs 509 and their nanocomposites could resolve the poor reusability of AC. Therefore, the studied 510 MWCNTs and their nanocomposites could be highly economical and efficient for removal of 511 both cationic and anionic dyes from aqueous solutions. 512\n37\n513\nAcknowledgements 514\nSandeep Kumar would like to thank DST, Govt. of India, University of Nebraska Lincoln 515 (UNL), the Daugherty Water for Food Institute (DWFI), and Indo-US Science and Technology 516 Forum (IUSSTF) for financial support through the Water Advanced Research and Innovation 517 (WARI) (research grant vide letter No. IUSSTF/WARI/2018/F-029-2018 dated 03-01-2018) 518 along with HSCST, Govt. of Haryana, India (research grant vide letter No. 519 HSCST/R&D/2018/2103 dated 01-08-2018), and the DST-PURSE sanctioned to GJUS&T, 520 Hisar under PURSE program No. SR/PURSE Phase 2/40(G).
