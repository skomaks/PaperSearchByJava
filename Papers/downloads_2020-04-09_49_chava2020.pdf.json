      "text" : "The yearning for renewable and sustainable energy, as well as environmental protection, has initiated tremendous research interest in photocatalysis, in which sunlight is used as a primary energy source. The photocatalytic water splitting reaction is a promising approach to convert the solar energy into high energy density fuel hydrogen (H2) to solve energy and environmental issues [1–3]. A suitable semiconductor, be it organic or inorganic material, is simply needed to bring about the desirable photo(electro)-chemical reaction. Apart from being cost-effective and environmentally benign, the practicability of a semiconductor for targeted applications mostly relies on the solar energy conversion efficiency of the material [4–6]. Since Fujishima-Honda reported photoelectrochemical water splitting [7], numerous photocatalysts, such as TiO2 [8,9], g-C3N4 [10,11], MoS2 [12,13], ZnIn2S4 [14,15], etc., have been extensively studied for their viability and efficiency in the photocatalyst field. Alternatively, substantial efforts have been made for the development of visible-light-driven photocatalysts, capable of absorbing visible light (≥420 nm) which is about 43% of the solar spectrum. Metal sulfides are considered as good candidates and among the various metal sulfide semiconductor photocatalysts, cadmium sulfide (CdS) has been widely explored as a visible light photocatalyst due to its narrow bandgap, proper bandstructures and higher negative conduction band edge position than H+/H2 redox potential [16,17]. However, the ultrafast charge recombination rate and fewer active sites on the surface of CdS yield low photocatalytic activity, hence considerably limiting the applications of CdS in H2 evolution reactions. As the H2 evolution activity of CdS materials continue to increase, several CdS nanostructures have been proposed for the efficient photocatalytic H2\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 619; doi:10.3390/nano10040619 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 619 2 of 17\nevolution reactions [18–23]. It is testified that the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of CdS greatly depends on its crystal structure, morphology, crystallinity and size [24], and all these parameters directly impact the band structures, bandgap energy and further electron-hole separation processes. Therefore, the design and synthesis of CdS nanostructures with higher surface areas, charge separation efficiency and with abundant active sites are indeed important. Meanwhile, one dimensional (1D) CdS nanostructures have received particular attention for the visible photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions due to their distinctive geometrical and electronic properties, which can provide large aspect-ratio, direct pathways for charge transport and decouple the direction of charge carrier collection [25,26]. In addition to the fast and long-distance photoexcited electron transport, high length-to-diameter of 1D nanostructures could improve the light absorption and scattering, which benefits the photocatalysis [27–31]. As a result, 1D nanostructures offer a suitable platform for understanding fundamental concepts about the roles of dimensionality and size in optical, electrical, and for photocatalytic solar energy conversion applications [27,32]. Among the several methods for the preparation of 1D CdS, the solvothermal approach is one of the ideal methods due to its simplicity, low cost, scalability, possibilities for the precise control of nucleation/growth, crystal structure, size and morphology [33]. Mostly, 1D CdS nanorods were synthesized by using ethylenediamine as solvent, for example, Jang et al utilized the solvothermal approach and obtained CdS nanowires at different reaction temperatures and times [34]. Next, Li et al. synthesized CdS nanorods (NRs) by using the hydrothermal method in which ethylenediamine acts as the template and coordination agent [35]. The results showed that the photocatalytic H2 evolution activities of CdS samples depend on the crystallinity, morphology and surface area. However, the quality of produced CdS NRs in the above reports is very poor since the final product contains a mixture of nanoparticles, nanosheets and nanorods instead of a single morphology. These types of products impede the photogenerated charge carriers’ separation and electron transfer process, consequently producing lower photocatalytic activity. Thus, it is highly desirable to produce high quality 1D CdS NRS for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions. Herein, we report the modified solvothermal synthesis of 1D CdS NRs at different reaction times by using elthylenediamine as solvent (at a temperature of 180 ◦C). The reaction time played a significant role in increasing the length of CdS NRs from 100 nm to several micrometers. The band structures, optical properties, and specific surface area of CdS NRs were determined. Moreover, the effect of CdS NR length on the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity was systematically investigated."

      "text" : "CdS nanorods were prepared by using a solvothermal method in which ethylenediamine (EDA) was used as solvent and the detailed process is illustrated in Scheme 1. The FE-SEM images of prepared CdS nanorods at different reaction times are displayed in Figure 1. According to Figure 1, the obtained CdS sample at all reaction times exhibits the nanorod morphology. As seen from FE-SEM images, the length of nanorods increases with the reaction time. Moreover at lower reaction times (6, 12 and 18 h), the CdS nanorods sample contains short nanorods with the long nanorods. At reaction temperatures of 24 and 48 h, the purity of the sample is high. Next, to further observe the morphological features, TEM images were also recorded and are shown in Figure 2. As seen from Figure 2, all CdS samples exhibit rod-like morphology with a diameter of 40 nm and as the reaction time increases the length of CdS nanorods increases to several micrometers. From TEM images, the average diameter of as prepared samples was calculated by using the statistical measurements. The observed diameters for the CdS nanorods are 13, 27, 29, 39 and 54 nm for C-6, C-12, C-18, C-24 and C-48 samples respectively. From these measurements, it was confirmed that the diameter of CdS nanorods also increases with the reaction time. The crystal structures of synthesized CdS samples were determined by X-ray diffraction studies. As shown in Figure 3, the diffraction patterns of all CdS samples show similar features. The diffraction peaks of CdS nanorods (C-6) were observed at 24.85◦, 26.60◦, 28.24◦, 36.76◦, 43.75◦, 47.95◦, 51.95◦, 52.88◦, 58.42◦ and 66.95◦ can be assigned to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112), (201), (202) and (203) planes of hexagonal CdS phase (JCPDS No: 00-001-0780) with cell constants of a = b = 0.4142 and c = 0.6724 nm. The crystallinity is good for all samples. As seen from Figure 3, the intensity of the (002) plane is observed to be high when compared to (100) and (101) planes for sample C-6, however as the reaction time increases the intensity of (100), and (101) planes increases while that of the (002) plane decreases, which may be a result of the growth of CdS nanorods to several micrometers.\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 619 4 of 17\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 17\nof the (002) plane is observed to be high when compared to (100) and (101) planes for sample C-6, however as the reaction time increases the intensity of (100), and (101) planes increases while that of the (002) plane decreases, which may be a result of the growth of CdS nanorods to several micrometers.\nScheme 1. The process for synthesizing the 1D CdS nanorods of different lengths.\nThe structural properties of the synthesized CdS NR samples were also studied by Raman spectroscopy. Since the CdS NRs belong to a hexagonal wurtzite structure with a space group of C64v, according to group theory, the vibrational modes 1A1 + 1E1 + 2E2 (E2H and E2L) are Raman active and the 2B2 modes are silent. The phonon vibrations E1 and E2 are in the x-y plane whereas the A1 phonon modes are in the z-direction [36,37]. The Raman spectra of the prepared CdS nanorods samples are given in Figure 4. As shown in Figure 4, the CdS NR sample C-6 exhibits two bands at 304 and 601 cm-1 which are assigned to the first and second order longitudinal optical modes (1-LO and 2-LO modes) respectively [38,39]. As the reaction time increases from 6 to 48 hours, the additional peaks observed below 300 cm-1 correspond to the high crystallinity of the samples at higher reaction times consistent with the powder XRD results [40]. The Raman bands of CdS NR samples C-12, C-18, C-24, and C-48 are slightly redshifted with respect to the C-6 sample, which can be ascribed to the lattice expansion along the c-axis since the peak positions are very sensitive to the lattice strain along the caxis [39,41]. Thus, Raman spectra further confirms the formation CdS nanorods. To further analyze the surface and chemical states of prepared CdS samples, XPS measurements were carried out and are shown in Figure 5. As seen from Figure 5a, the high resolution XPS spectrum of Cd-3d core-level exhibit two peaks at 404.32 and 411.10 eV for the C-6 sample. These two binding energy peaks separated by ~6.8 eV are ascribed to Cd-3d5/2 and Cd-3d3/2 for Cd2+ in CdS [42,43]. Next Figure 5b shows the XPS spectrum of S-2p core level which displayed two binding energy peaks around 160.78 and 161.94 eV corresponding to the S-2p3/2 and S-2p1/2 respectively. The two binding energy peaks separated by 1.16 eV is characteristic of S2- in CdS structure [44,45]. Figure 5a,b also shows the XPS spectra of C-18, C-24 and C-48 samples. The spectra show similar features to that of C-6, however there is a positive shift in the binding energy values as the reaction time increases. Among the samples, C-24 shows the highest positive shift in both Cd-3d and S-2p core-level spectra. From the XPS data and XRD measurements, CdS NRs were successfully prepared. The specific surface area and pore-size distribution analysis of CdS samples was studied by recording the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. As shown in Figure 6a, the isotherms for all CdS samples exhibited a typical Type-II isotherm patterns with a narrow H3 Hysteresis loop. Figure 6b shows the pore-size distribution curves which confirms the existence of mesopores. Generally, it is supposed that the H3 hysteresis loop is linked to the mesopores through the aggregates of plate-like particles [46]. However, there were no plate-like particles observed in the current work. Thus, the mesopores may be derived from the random aggregation of CdS NRs, which were further observed from the corresponding pore size distribution curves [47].

Valence band XPS spectra of CdS NRs prepared at different reaction times: (a) C-6, (b) C-18, (c) C-24, and (d) C-48.\nNext, the optical bandgaps of CdS NR samples were determined from the following equation [53]:\nαhν = A(hν-Eg)n/2 (1)\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 619 10 of 17\nwhere α, h, υ, A and Eg are the absorption coefficient, Planck’s constant, frequency of incident light, proportionality constant and optical bandgap energy respectively. The value of n depends on the energy transition in a semiconductor with n = 1 for direct transition and n = 1/2 for indirect transition. Here, CdS is characterized by a strong absorption in the visible region and hence its n value could be taken as 1 throughout the calculations. From the bandgap energy equation, Tauc’s plots were analyzed by extrapolating (αhv)2 versus photon energy (hv). The intercept of the tangent to the hv axis in a Tauc’s plot can give a good estimation of the band gap energy. Consequently, the band gap measurement values of CdS NRs prepared at different reaction times are presented in Figure 7b and determined as 2.37, 2.41, 2.41, 2.40 and 2.41 eV for C-6, C-12, C-18, C-24 and C-48 respectively. The band gap value of C-6 is slightly lower than that of other samples and is in accordance with the light absorption. These results suggest that the bandgap changes in CdS material could display higher photocatalytic activity. In addition, to understand the energy band structures of CdS NRs, valence band (VB) XPS spectra for all CdS samples were recorded and a linear extrapolation was carried out to calculate the VB positions (EVB) of the photocatalysts samples. As seen in Figure 8a–d, the VB positions of C-6, C-18, C-24 and C-48 are 0.91, 1.05, 1.40 and 1.53 eV respectively.

The CdS nanorod sample, C-18 significantly outperforms the other CdS samples.\nFigure 11. Time course of H2 evolution of CdS nanorod samples prepared at different reaction times.\nNext, the H2 evolution rates of CdS NR samples were shown in Figure 12a. As expected, H2 evolution activity of CdS NRs considerably varied with the length. These results showed that the CdS NR sample obtained at a reaction time of 18 hours (C-18) displayed the highest photocatalytic activity. Next, the H2 evolution rates of CdS NR samples were measured and presented in Figure 12b. As seen from Figure 12b, C-18 sample exhibited the H2 evolution rate of 206 μmol.g-1.h-1 whereas the remaining samples showed 144, 191, 97 and 66 μmol.g-1.h-1 for C-6, C-12, C-24 and C-48 respectively. In general, a good photocatalyst is characterized by a higher specific surface area since all the photocatalytic reactions occur at the photocatalyst surface. However, in the present work, CdS samples having a higher surface area display a lower photocatalytic activity. Therefore, surface area is not an influential parameter, however, crystallinity played a role in improving the H2 evolution activity of CdS samples. As per the XRD patters in Figure 3, the crystallinity of CdS samples increases with the reaction time, indicating that the higher crystallinity sample produces higher photocatalytic activity which is supported by the previous works [18]. Table 2 compares the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of different CdS nanostructures, in which the obtained H2 evolution rate in the present work is outperformed and comparable with the reported results.\nFigure 11. i e course of 2 l i f r s les re ared at different reaction times.\next, the H2 evolution rates of CdS NR samples were shown in Figure 12a.

Comparison of the H2 evolution rates of CdS photocatalysts.\nThe schematic illustration for the visible photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of the optimized C18 sample is proposed and depicted in Scheme 2. Generally, the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity mainly depends on light absorption properties, band structures and charge separation efficiency. The C-18 sample synthesized in this work possesses optimized length with the improved light absorption properties in the visible region, promoting photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. When the photocatalyst sample CdS (C-18) is irradiated with visible light, the electrons in valence band (VB) are excited to conduction band (CB) of CdS and leave holes in the VB. The electrons in the conduction band, having a higher negative redox potential (ECB = −1.36 eV), reduce the 2H+ to H2. Meanwhile, the holes with positive oxidation potential (EVB = 1.05 eV) in the valence band oxidize the sacrificial agent, lactic acid. Moreover, the suppressed electron-hole recombination rate also promotes the charge separation efficiency (confirmed from PL measurements). As a result, higher photocatalytic H2\nFigure 12.

    "abstractText" : "One dimensional (1D) metal sulfide nanostructures are one of the most promising materials for photocatalytic water splitting reactions to produce hydrogen (H2). However, tuning the nanostructural, optical, electrical and chemical properties of metal sulfides is a challenging task for the fabrication of highly efficient photocatalysts. Herein, 1D CdS nanorods (NRs) were synthesized by a facile and low-cost solvothermal method, in which reaction time played a significant role for increasing the length of CdS NRs from 100 nm to several micrometers. It is confirmed that as the length of CdS NR increases, the visible photocatalytic H2 evolution activity also increases and the CdS NR sample obtained at 18 hr. reaction time exhibited the highest H2 evolution activity of 206.07 μmol.g−1.h−1. The higher H2 evolution activity is explained by the improved optical absorption properties, enhanced electronic bandstructure and decreased electron-hole recombination rate.",
