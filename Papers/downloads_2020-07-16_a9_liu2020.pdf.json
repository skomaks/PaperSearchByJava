      "text" : "Construction of heterometallic nanoclusters containing both d-block metals and lanthanide (III) ions has received much interest during recent years due to their unique optical, electrical and magnetic properties. [1,2] One useful way to organize individual molecular components into nanosize species is through the coordination self-assembly between the metal ions and ligands. Fluorescent response for selective detection of metal ions is currently of interest because of its potential application in environment, biology and medicine. [3-7] For example, the development of fluorescent molecular sensors for the recognition of Cd 2+ ion has great significance in the environmental protection due to its toxicity and carcinogenicity. Luminescent lanthanide complexes display unrivalled spectroscopic properties, including large Stokes shifts, sharp emission bands and long lifetimes. Near-infrared (NIR) luminescent lanthanide complexes with Nd(III), Yb(III) and Er(III) ions may have some advantages in bioassays because biological tissues are transparent in this spectral range (900-1600 nm). [8,9] So far, many Eu(III)- and Tb(III)-based complexes with visible luminescence have been used to detect analytes, [10-13] however, there are very few reports on the NIR luminescent lanthanide-based complexes used as sensors for the detection. The Eu(III)- and Tb(III)-based complexes have absorption and emission in the ultraviolet-visible light range, which limits their use in biological systems. Undoubtedly, the development of NIR luminescent lanthanide-based probes will provide more opportunities to conduct studies in biological processes at the molecular level. [14,15]\nIt is known that, metal chromophores with d-block transition-metal ions such as Zn(II), [16] Ru(II), [17] Pt(II) [18] and Cd(II) [19]\nmay act as efficient sensitizers for the NIR lanthanide luminescence (“antenna effect”). With two dissimilar metal-binding sites, compartmental Schiff base lignds have been widely used to synthesize heterometallic d-f complexes. [20,21] In our previous study, a series of “multi-decker” lanthanide complexes were constructed from salen type Schiff base ligand bis(3-methoxysalicylidene)ethylene-1,2-phenylenediamine (H2L, Scheme 1), in which Ln(III) ions are sandwiched between alternating layers of the Schiff-base ligands. [22,23] As part of our current research interests in the luminescent response of d-4f complexes towards various analytes, [24,25] we report here the\nconstruction and NIR luminescence properties of a 6-metal Zn-Yb complex [Zn2Yb4L2(OAc)10(OH)2(CH3OH)2] (1) synthesized from the reaction of H2L with Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and YbCl3·6H2O. Unlike those “multi-decker” lanthanide complexes we synthesized from H2L before, [20,21] 1 shows a rectangular structure with sizes of approximately 0.8 × 1.1 × 2.8 nm, in which all metal ions are almost in one plane. Interestingly, 1 shows NIR luminescent response towards metal ions, especially to Cd 2+ ion at ppm level.\nScheme 1 Schiff base ligand H2L."

      "text" : "Synthesis and crystal structure of the complex The Schiff-base ligand H2L was prepared according to well established procedures. [26] Reaction of H2L with Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and YbCl3·6H2O in refluxing MeOH gave the Zn-Yb complex 1. The yellow crystalline product of 1 was obtained by the slow diffusion of diethyl ether into the reaction solution, and zinc chloride ([ZnCl2(H2O)CH3OH)]) was found in the crystalline solid of the product. As shown in Figure 1, the X-ray structure of 1 reveals a centrosymmetric core with two equivalent ZnYb2L moieties, which are linked together by two OAc - anions. The molecular dimensions of 1 are about 0.8 × 1.1 × 2.8 nm. In the ZnYb2L moiety, Zn 2+\nion exhibits a square pyramidal geometry, bound in the O2N2 cavity of the Schiff base ligand. For the two Yb 3+ ions, one is bound by the O2O2 set of the Schiff base ligand and another one is coordinated with five OAc - and one OH - anions. The Zn 2+ ion is linked with the former Yb 3+ ion by the Schiff base ligand and two OAc - anions, with a separation of 3.386 Å. Both Yb 3+\nions are nine-coordinated and exhibit a single cap square antiprism geometry. The OAc - anions exhibit μ2 and μ3 coordination modes with the Yb 3+\nions. The Schiff base ligand is bound to metal ions through its N and O atoms. In 1, all Yb 3+ ions are linked together by ten OAc - anions\nNN\nOH\nOCH3\nHO\nH3CO\nThis article has been accepted for publication and undergone full peer review but has not been through the copyediting, typesetting, pagination and proofreading process which may lead to differences between this version and the Version of Record.

The Zn-N, Zn-O and Yb -O bond lengths range from 2.044 Å to 2.046 Å, 1.988 Å to 2.225 Å, and 2.338 Å to 2.662 Å, respectively.\nThe panoramic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum of 1 are shown in Figure 2. The molar ratio of Zn/Yb in the EDX spectrum of 1 is found to be about 1:2, consistent with the crystal structure. Molar conductivity study indicates that 1 is neutral in CH3CN, confirming the stability of the complex in solution. Thermogravimetric analysis exhibits that 1 loses about 2% of the weight when it is heated at 100 o C (Figure S2), due to the escaping of solvent molecules in the product. It is found that, when the crystalline product of 1 is separated from its mother solution, it rapidly loses crystallinity. The powder XRD pattern of 1 shows many weak diffraction peaks with large background peaks (Figure S3), confirming its amorphous nature. The Zn-Yb complex starts to discompose when it is heated at 220 o C (Figure S2).\nFigure 1 The nano-rectangular structure of 1.\nFigure 2 Scanning electron microscopy image (SEM, a) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy spectrum (EDX, b) of 1\nPhotophysical properties and response to metal ions The free H2L shows UV-visible absorption bands originated from the π-π* transition, which are red-shifted in 1 due to the perturbation of metal ions to the transition (Figure 3). The luminescence properties of 1 was studied in CH3CN. Excited by ligand-centered absorption bands, 1 shows typical NIR luminescence of Yb 3+ ( 2 F5/2 → 2 F7/2 transition) at 977 nm (Figure 4). For the lanthanide luminescence, 1 exhibits broad ligand-centered excitation bands,\nFigure 3 UV-visible absorption spectra of the free ligand H2L and complex 1 in CH3CN. (C = 5 × 10 -6 M)\nin agreement with their absorption spectra. This confirms that the energy transfer from Zn/L centers to Yb 3+ ions occurs in 1. The NIR emission lifetime (τ) of 1 in CH3CN is 14.9 μs (Figure 4). Thus, the intrinsic quantum yield (Ln) of Yb 3+ in 1 is calculated to be 0.7% (Ln = τ/τ0, τ0 = 2000 μs, the natural lifetime of Yb 3+ ion). [27]\nThe overall NIR emission quantum yield (em) of 1 is 0.1%. The ligand-to-metal energy transfer (LMET) efficiency (ηsens = em/Ln) in 1 is estimated to be 14.3%. [28]\nCompared with NIR fluorescent probes based on organic fluorophores, NIR luminescent lanthanide-based sensors may show some advantages such as photostability, large Stokes shifts, and long lifetimes. [14,15] The lanthanide luminescent response of 1 towards metal ions Cd 2+ , Co 2+ , Cu 2+ , Na + , Mg 2+ , Fe 3+ , Al 3+ , Ni 2+ , Ag + , Li + , Zn 2+ , K + and Cr 3+ , has been investigated in CH3CN. The acetonitrile solutions of metal acetates with different concentrations were added into the acetonitrile solution of 1 (50 µM). Interestingly, the luminescence intensities at 977 nm of 1 are gradually decreased as the concentrations of metal ions increase (Figures S5). The addition of Cd 2+ ion causes a more rapid decrease of the luminescence intensity than the addition of other metal ions. For example, the emission intensity of 1 is decreased about 50% when the concentration of added Cd 2+ ion is 4.3 µM, which is lower than those of others (Figures 5 and S5). These results indicate that, compared with other metal ions, 1 shows higher sensitivity to Cd 2+ ion through lanthanide luminescent response.\nThe Stern-Volmer equation KSV = (I0/I - 1)/[A] can be used to calculate the emission quenching efficiencies (KSV) of 1 to metal ions, where [A] is the concentration of added metal ion, and I0 (or I) is the emission intensity of 1 at 977 nm before (or after) the addition of metal ion. [29] As shown in Figure 6, 1 shows the largest KSV value towards Cd 2+ ion (2.13 × 10 5 M -1 ). The limit of detection (LOD) of 1 to metal ion can be estimated by 3σ/Ksv, [30]\nwhere σ is the standard deviation. The LOD value of 1 to Cd 2+ ion is calculated to be 0.56 µM, which is comparable to those reported\n(b) (a)\n2.8 nm\n300 400 500 600 0.00\n0.15\n0.30\n0.45 H\n2 L\n1\nA b\ns o\nrp ti\no n\n(  1\n0 5\n/M -1 c\nm -1 )\n/nm\nA cc\nep\nte\nd\nA\nrti cl\ne\nThis article is protected by copyright.

[31-33]\nThese results indicate that 1 shows luminescent response to Cd 2+ ion at ppm level.\nThe added metal ions may affect the LMET process in 1 due to their perturbation to the electronic structure and excited state of the Schiff base ligand, resulting in so-called chelation enhancement of the quenching emission (CHEQ) effect. [34] For example, d-block metal ions such as Co 2+ , Cu 2+ , Fe 3+ , Ni 2+ and Cr 3+ may quench the lanthanide luminescence through f→d energy transfers. [35,36] The luminescence response of 1 to the addition of Cd 2+ ion has been furtherly studied through UV-vis titration. [37]\nIt is found that, the addition of Cd 2+ ion decreases the absorption of 1 at the excitation wavelength (λex = 305 nm) of lanthanide luminescence (Figure S6). This is not advantageous for the Schiff base ligand to absorb light energy to sensitize lanthanide luminescence in 1, resulting in the high KSV value to Cd 2+ ion. [38] Further investigation indicates that, after the addition of 4.3 μM Cd 2+ ion, the luminescence lifetime (τ) and overall emission quantum yield (Φem) of 1 are found to be 10.8 μs and 0.06%, respectively. Thus, the LMET efficiency (ηsens) in 1 is calculated to be 11.1%, which is lower than that without the addition of Cd 2+ ion.\nFigure 6 Lanthanide luminescence quenching efficiencies (KSV) of 1 towards metal cations."
