      "text" : "Nanomaterials are the materials with one-billionth of a meter in size (1–100 nm) which have novel properties due to their small size. The change of their properties can be color appearance, conductivity (the same metal can be insulator or semiconductor at the nanoscale), strength, and surface-volume ratio which is ~40% higher than the bulk particles or atoms. Nowadays, the fabrication of appropriate nanomaterials is critical to be used in the desired applications. The global market of nanotechnology reached $14 billion in 2015 and is projected to reach $55 billion by 2022 [1].\nApproaches for synthesizing nanomaterials are either top-down or bottom-up. The first approach derives the nanomaterials by breaking down a block and bulk substrate via grinding, ball milling, chemical etching, sputtering, and thermal/laser ablation (Fig. 1a). The other approach is bottom-up, involving the self-assemble of atoms to new nuclei which grow into a nanoparticle under certain conditions (Fig. 1b). This approach synthesis includes precipitation, microwave-assisted synthesis, sol-gel process, hydrothermal/solvothermal, spray/laser pyrolysis, and chemical/ electrochemical routes. The advantages and disadvantages of each synthesis procedure are summarized in Table 1. Furthermore, green synthesis of nanomaterials is a bottom-up approach which will be highlighted in this chapter.\nEach synthesis procedure has a significant effect on the produced nanomaterials. Despite the top-down approach is a large-scale production technique, it leads to uncontrollable sizes and irregular edge structures. In contrast, the bottom-up\nsynthesis approach is a low-cost technique and may serve as an indispensable tool to create structurally defined nanoparticles/nanocomposites with narrow size distribution [10]. Even with many procedures for synthesizing various nanomaterials, their long-term applications demand an eco-friendly synthesis route which is costeffective and contributing to the improvement of the production rate.\nNanomaterials can be synthesized employing one of the main routes: sonication, wet-chemical, and hydrothermal. Among those synthesis methods, wet-chemical route is common in the bottom-up approach [7]. As an example, the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) is common using sodium citrate: C6H5Na3O7 2H2O [11]. Citrate is preferred due to its role in the synthesis process where hydroxyl groups form hydrated electrons that are responsible for reduction of Ag+ ions to Ag0 (Eq. 1). This can be summarized as (i) formation of Ag+-citrate complex at the room temperature, (ii) generation of Ag metal particles at higher temperature as a reducing agent, and (iii) a capping compound to preserve the formed Ag nuclei. Furthermore, citrate facilitates the functionalization of nanoparticles because it can be exchanged with other compounds due to the weak interaction of citrate molecules with metal surfaces, for instance [12].\nC6H5O 3 7 þ 2 Agþ ! C6H5O2 5 þ Hþ þ CO2 þ 2 Ag0 ð1Þ\nNanomaterials are broadly applied in our life and contribute for all industrial sectors. It is integrated in agriculture, cement, and food industries which include food processing, packages, and fertilizers. SiO2 (E551), MgO (E530), and TiO2 (E171) are permitted to be used as anticaking agent, flavor, and food color additives [13]. Furthermore, the nano-application in water/wastewater treatment can improve the quality of domestic and industrial effluents through removal or degradation of various pollutants [14]. Its application involves filtration, sorption, and catalytic degradation. It is recommended to use nanomaterials over the conventional materials\n(i.e., clay, zeolite, agriculture-based sorbents, etc.) because of their high uptake capacity and targeting specific pollutants with the functionalization groups [15].\nThe ecotoxicological effect of nanomaterials is always a matter of concern. As the size of the particles is in the nanoscale, nanoparticles are generally more toxic when inhaled than are larger particles of the same material. When clumps of single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) lodged in the lungs of the rats, ~15% of them died from choking. However, researchers have found that by bonding simple chemicals to carbon spheres, they could reduce toxicity. This finding could be helpful in enabling nano-application in various fields."

      "heading" : "Sustainable Nanotechnology",
      "text" : "Recently, the aim of nanotechnology application is to minimize the use of harsh and hazardous reagents/chemicals and maximize the efficiency of the nano-synthesis process. Hence, green nanotechnology is applied and defined by the 12 principles of green chemistry. For instance, choosing the suitable green solvents, environmentally benign reducing agents, and nontoxic material for the stabilization of nanoparticles is of essential considerations.\nOptimization of the green nanotechnology is critical for fast and facile synthesis of different nanomaterials with desired sizes and morphologies. There are several agents derived from nature have been explored: plant extracts, biodegradable materials, and microorganisms. Herein, plant-mediated synthesis of nanoparticles is focused because plant extracts are sustainable nano-synthesis route over other biogenic methods. It has advantages including the following [16]: (i) low cost, (ii) bulk availability, (iii) safety, (iv) the use as dual functions (reducing agents/capping agents), (v) storage at room temperature for a long time, (vi) the synthesis rate is high and the reaction time requires minutes to several hours to be completed, and (vii) no need for culturing or cell maintenance. On the other hand, using microorganisms that require culture media that take two or several days (time-consuming), some toxic microorganisms are used for nano-production, and the synthesis rate is low [17].\nThere are various literature describing the role of different plant parts as leaves, roots, bark, stem, fruit, and peels in the synthesis of various shapes and sizes of nanomaterials. A wide range of nanosizes are recorded using a variety of plant extracts as illustrated in Table 2. Plant extract is preferred due to the presence of phytochemicals and biomolecules such as proteins, flavonoids, amino acids, vitamins, polysaccharides, polyphenols, tannins, terpenoids, and organic acids (Fig. 2). Tannins are classified into hydrolysable (gallic and ellagic acids) and condensed which vary in the plant parts according to temperature, soil quality, and light intensity. Studies have indicated that all these molecules not only play a role in reducing the ions to nanosize but also play an important role in the capping of the nanomaterials [18]. Qasim et al. [19] compared the production routes of iron oxide nanorods by green synthesis using plant extract of Withania coagulans and\naFeO, iron oxide; Fe, iron; TiO2, titanium dioxide; Fe/TiO2, iron-titanium dioxide nanocomposite; nZVI, nano-iron zerovalent; ZnO, zinc oxide; CeO2, cerium oxide; Ag, silver; rGO, reduced graphene oxide; NA, not available\nchemical method of reduction precipitation. The green-produced nano-iron oxide was crystalline with particle size of 16 nm, while the chemical one was amorphous with particle size of 18 nm.\nIn the synthesis of green nanoparticles, the plant extract is mixed with a precursor solution for minutes (Fig. 3). The conversion of the state of mono/divalent oxidation material to zerovalent states confirms the formation of nanoparticles. It can be also physically indicated through the color change in the medium vessel [30].\nThe significant parameters which might be considered in the synthesis process of stable and well-characterized green nanoparticles are the type and concentration of plant extracts, precursors, pH, and reaction time. The reaction conditions can be obtained at temperatures not greater than 100 C with no toxic solvents. Despite this interest, few scholars highlighted the mechanism of the green synthesis of nanomaterials and no reports for scaling-up the production process."

      "text" : "The produced nanomaterials must be characterized by morphology, size, shape, composition, stability, and surface area during and after the synthesis process as illustrated in Fig. 4. Nano-morphology can be done using developed and sophisticated techniques such as transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM, SEM). They are used to visualize the morphology of the nanoparticles to understand its meaning and shaping not only imaging the nanoparticles.\nEnergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) is used to determine and prove the elemental composition of the nanoparticles, dynamic light scattering (DLS) is used\nAddition of natural reducing agents either\ndrop by drop orcompletely\nto realize the size distribution pattern of the nano present in a suspension or a solution, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is carried out to study the crystal structure of the synthesized nanoparticles, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is used to identify the responsible functional groups in plant extract.\nUV-Vis spectroscopy is used for absorbance measurement in the range of 300–800 nm for characterizing various nanomaterials from 2 to 100 nm. Table 3 summarizes the used wavelength ranges for confirming the type of the nanoparticles. The wavelength of most nanoparticles varies in a certain range depending on their shape and size. Furthermore, it is used to determine the stability of nanoparticles over time.\nAnother spectroscopy technique is Raman spectra which is used to identify and characterize carbon-based nanomaterials [2, 4]. It is considered as fingerprint spectra to distinct between the broad range of carbon nanomaterials. The main bands are G, D, and 2D which are different in each nanomaterial according to the positions, intensities, and shapes of the peaks. The existence of defects in carbon-based nanomaterials is represented by D band due to disorders and vacancies. Another feature is G band from the ordered in-plane sp2 carbon (E2g symmetry).\n2D band arises from convolution of infinite number of peaks which determines the number and orientation of the layers in graphene as an example."

      "heading" : "Green Nanomaterials for Water Purifications",
      "text" : "Many countries that encountered significant water shortage such as South Africa (Africa), India (Asia), Chile, and Mexico (South America) are expected to run out of water in the future [31]. It is estimated that ~884 million people worldwide lack access to clean and safe water. Besides, there are wastewater from different industrial sectors, including heavy metals [32–34], dyes [35], and organic pollutants [3, 4] which discharge without proper treatment to the water bodies.\nNowadays, engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are used in various products and applications that are continuing to be developed. The key strategy of nano-applications is to ensure the sustainability of food, water, and energy nexus. During 2005– 2020, the cumulative published documents in Scopus database are 1196 and 1561 for the keywords “Nanomaterials + Water treatment” and “Nanomaterials + Energy storage,” respectively. Figure 5a illustrates the rising in the number of documents\nrelated to nanomaterials in water treatment and energy storage in the last 15 years. Figure 5b and c shows that articles are the highest percentage in document types followed by literature. The major water/wastewater and energy applications of nanomaterials were highlighted in Fig. 6.\nThe integration of nanomaterials or nanocomposites in water treatment system is encouraged over the conventional materials because of the small particle size, high porosity, and large surface area. According to the IUPAC, the pore size of porous materials can be divided into three classes: microporous materials (<2 nm), mesoporous materials (2–50 nm), and macroporous materials (>50 nm). The next section highlights the sustainable synthesis of various nanomaterials, for instance, zerovalent metal nanomaterials, metal-based nanomaterials, carbon-based nanomaterials, and nanocomposites."

      "heading" : "Zerovalent Metal Nanomaterials",
      "text" : "The preferred zerovalent metal nanomaterials are nano-iron zerovalent (nZVI) that refbearing to elemental iron with zero charge er iron atoms [37]. The characteristic of superparamagnetism is a unique one for those iron nanoparticles <10–20 nm. Wang et al. [38] synthesized nZVI and iron oxide nanoparticles using the extracts of Eucalyptus leaves and green tea. The corresponding extracts were added to 0.10 M FeSO4 with a volume ratio of 2:1 and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The appearance of black color indicated the reduction of iron ions.\nOther plant extracts as Rosa damascena, Thymus vulgaris, and Urtica dioica were investigated [39]. The aforementioned extracts were prepared by boiling the plant leaves (60 g L 1) at 80 C for 1 h. Each extract was added to 0.1 M FeCl2 4H2O in the ratio 3:2 with pH ¼ 6. Somchaidee and Tedsree [40] found that the extract of guava leaf is able to prepare nano Fe0 from soluble Fe3+ in basic aqueous solution (pH ¼8) at room temperature. This is attributed to the presence of tannins (major component of polyphenolic groups) which form strong complex with Fe3+ and stabilize nano Fe0 from aggregation. Moreover, with an increase of pH to 8,\nthe deprotonation of phytochemicals increased and provided more binding sites for Fe3+, whereas they remain protonated at low pH.\nIn the last 10 years, nano-iron zerovalent (nZVI) has been used to degrade/ remove various emerging pollutants due to its higher reactivity and surface area than iron zerovalent. When nZVI degrades organic pollutants, the nanoparticles serve as electron donors. The two electrons are transferred to an oxygen molecule to form hydrogen peroxide, which is further reduced to a water molecule [41]. The degradation mechanism of pollutants can be summarized according the following reactions (Eqs. 2, 3, and 4).\nO2 þ Fe0 þ 2Hþ ! Fe2þ þ H2O2 ð2Þ\nFe2þ þ H2O2 !

      "text" : "Titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), and silicon dioxide (SiO2) are the common produced metal-based nanomaterials as mentioned in Zhu et al. [42]. They have wide applications in energy and water. However, the impact assessment of their applications should be evaluated in more details.\nVarious synthesis routes were stated for the synthesis of metal-based nanomaterials, for instance, solvothermal, hydrothermal, precipitation, sol-gel, microwave, mechanochemical, and green techniques. The mentioned synthesis routes except green techniques require harsh experimental conditions with large volume of toxic chemicals as reducing and capping agents, expensive equipment, and energy consumption [4]. Therefore, sustainable and green technologies are developed to enhance the synthesis of metal-based nanomaterials.\nNano-TiO2 and nano-ZnO are semiconducting transition metal oxides. They have unique optical properties with wide band gap of 3.03–3.20 eV and 3.36–3.7 eV, respectively. Moreover, both nanomaterials possess electrical, excellent photocatalysts and resistance to chemical erosion properties, so they are able to degrade contaminants up to the parts-per-billion level.\nThe production of TiO2 has reached up to 10,000 tons/year worldwide due to its applications in sunscreens, paint materials, etc. [43]. Nano-TiO2 is successfully biosynthesized using the leaf extracts of Trigonella foenum-graecum [22], Jatropha curcas L. [44], and Eucalyptus globulus [45]. Subsequent to its biosynthesis, NanoTiO2 is usually applied as a photocatalytic reduction for most pollutants. Its photocatalytic reduction mechanism includes many steps [44]. TiO2 absorbs UV light and the generated electrons promote to the conduction band, higher energy level (Eq. 5). Consequently, O2 is reduced to superoxide radical anion (\n.O 2 ) because the generated electron has strong reduction ability (Eq. 6). Then pollutants (e.g., heavy metals,\nM2+) is reduced to M (Eq. 7). The holes of valence band are reacted with H2O to form hydroxyl radicals (.OH) for oxidation reaction if applicable with the studied pollutant (Eq. 8).\nTiO2 þ hν ! hþ þ e ð5Þ e þ O2 ! O 2 ð6Þ\nM2þ þ 2e ! M ð7Þ\nH2O + h+ .OH + H+\n+ organics CO2 + H2O ð8Þ\nNano-ZnO is used in a wide range of industrial applications as electrical devices, cosmetic industries, nanofertilizers, drug, and gene delivery. Furthermore, it is considered as an excellent sensor for detecting pollutants and environmental remediation [46]. Few literature focused on the green synthesis of nano-ZnO using the extracts of Ixora coccinea leaf [47], Solanum torvum [48], and jujube fruit [49]. The preparation of nano-ZnO involves the ionization of zinc nitrate to Zn2+ which is reduced using the suitable plant extract (e.g., polyphenol) to form nano-ZnO as illustrated in Fig. 7.\nNano-SiO2 is one of the top five nanoparticles used in various consumer products [50]. It can be used in textiles as a resistance to UV radiation fiber, food industry as an additive, food packaging to preserve food fresh, and cement industry to accelerate its hydration and reduce its setting time. There is no literature for using plant extracts\nin synthesizing those nanomaterials. However, agricultural wastes or unwanted biomasses can be involved in the synthesis process. Adam et al. [51] and Imoisili et al. [52] synthesized nanosilica by sol-gel technique using rice husk and palm kernel shell ash, respectively. The formed spherical nanoparticles have BET surface area of 245 m2 g 1 and average size of 50.9 nm with rice husk, while they have BET surface area of 438 m2 g 1 and size in the range of 50–98 nm."

      "heading" : "Carbon-Based Nanomaterials",
      "text" : "Carbon-based nanomaterials are well known for their applications in all fields of science and technology. The type of bonding that goes on between molecules causes materials to have certain properties (such as conductivity). In addition, the way atoms and molecules fit together can affect material’s properties\nCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) have nano-diameters (1–30 nm) with lengths in micrometer, which yield a length-to-diameter ratio >1000 [15]. Their types are single-walled carbon nanotubes (SW-CNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MW-CNTs). The difference between SW-CNT and MW-CNT is the number of carbon cylindrical arrays arranged around the hallow nanotube core [14].\nCNTs are known to be aggregated and form tight bundles due to van der Waals interactions. Hence, the functionalization of CNTs is favored to reduce those interactions by electrostatic repulsions. The functionalization can be conducted through (i) covalent bonding using partial grafting on C¼C that convert sp2 into sp3 carbons and (ii) non-covalent bonding using adsorption of the functional molecules onto the surface.\nOne of the superstars after CNTs and fullerenes (C60) in recent years is graphene, due to its amazing properties. Its electron flow is much faster than silicon because of its extreme conductivity. It is the thinnest (106 x thinner than a human hair) and the strongest compound (~100–300 stronger than steel) but flexible and transparent (absorb 2% of incident light) [53]. The precursor of graphene is graphite which is used in pencils and lubricants. Graphite is sheets of carbon atoms bonded together by the van der Waals force, and the sheets slide easily over each other.\nGraphite oxide (GO) is one of the graphene-related nanomaterials that have an excellent physical and chemical stability. The functionalization of its surface with oxygen functional groups (hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, and epoxy groups) can enhance the adsorption capacity compared to CNTs [67]. Ji et al. [54] found the adsorption equilibrium time for tylosin was 5 and 7 days for graphite oxide and graphene nanosheets, respectively. On the other hand, the equilibrium time on single-walled carbon nanotubes was 35 days.\nApul et al. [55] concluded that chemical-synthesized graphite oxide has better adsorption capacities than CNTs and granular activated carbon for phenanthrene and biphenyl. They found also the impact of organic matter on adsorption with graphite oxide was negligible. The reason can be due to the oxygen functional groups (acidic groups) on GO that do not allow organic matter (negatively charged) to coat on GO surface because of the electrical repulsion.\nDespite the mesoporous structure of GO, it is usually having low to medium surface area. This may be attributed to the agglomerations of GO layers during drying process at 100 C because of the unavoidable van der Waals force between each single sheet of GO. The application of GO is still promising and investigated in water/wastewater management. Its mechanism for removal of various pollutants depends on the sorbate’s structure and the adsorptive sites of the sorbent (GO) [4].\nKonicki et al. [56] investigated the removal of two textile azo dyes, Acid Orange 8 (AO8) and Direct Red 23 (DR23), using GO. Their maximum adsorption capacities on GO were 29 and 15.3 mg g 1 for AO8 and DR23, respectively. As the surface of GO is negatively charged due to the existence of large amount of oxygen-containing functional groups (epoxy, carboxyl, and hydroxyl), GO surface becomes positively charged at acidic pH. Consequently, the electrostatic interactions between the dyes and GO are involved in the adsorption mechanism. AO8 is an anionic dye which contains one sulfonic acid group (–SO3Na), and DR23 is an anionic azo dye which contains two sulfonic acid groups. Both dyes were dissociated to sodium ions (Na+) in the aqueous solutions and the sulfonate anions (–SO3\n) in the aqueous solutions. The sulfonate anions interact with the positively charged sites on GO surface (–COOH2 +, –OH2 +) at acidic pH. At basic pH, the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are deprotonated to anionic form. Phatthanakittiphong and Seo [57] prepared chemical graphite oxide for sorption of bisphenol A (BPA). The adsorption capacity of BPA increased with increasing initial BPA concentration from 25 mg g 1 (20 mg L 1) to 37.5 mg g 1 (60 mg L 1). The increment of GO dose concentration from 0.2 to 4 g L 1 resulted in the enhancement of BPA removal from 17 to 70%. As the structures of the BPA and GO are analogous, it led to better adsorption. Furthermore, the intraparticle diffusion was integrated in the adsorption process."

They can comprise porous, gels, colloids, and copolymers. Magnetic nanomaterials are recommended to be used in water/wastewater treatment because they can be recovered and reused in the system for many cycles.\nThe sorption capacity of magnetic graphene oxide (GO/Fe2O3) has been investigated [58]. The maximum sorption was found in the order of Pb(II)>Cu(II)>Cd (II). It is worthy to note that this order is because of the behavior of the metal ions in the aqueous solutions which attributed to the following:\n(i) The electronegativity of the metals, which are 2.10, 1.90, and 1.69 for Pb(II), Cu (II), and Cd(II), respectively. It means ion exchange may be a dominant mechanism to explain the metal adsorption,\n(ii) The small hydrated radius of Pb(II); 0.401 nm compared to Cu(II); 0.419 nm and Cd(II); 0.426 nm. It results in a quick saturation of adsorption sites in case of\nCu(II) and Cd(II). On the other hand, Pb(II) has a higher charge density which favors attractive electrostatic interactions with nanomaterials.\nIn contrast, other graphene-based inorganic nanomaterials (rGO/TiO2, rGO/ZnO, etc.) have still limitations for practical implementation in remediation. Those limitations are separation, recovery, and reuse of the catalyst after the treatment. In summary, many investigations were conducted to test the performance of the aforementioned nanomaterials in water/wastewater treatment as shown in Table 4. It is worth to mention that most literature depend on the removal percentage as an indicator for the adsorption performance and ignoring the uptake capacity. Therefore, the initial missing parameters are calculated and highlighted in Table 4."

      "text" : "This chapter gives an essential overview on green nanotechnology. Green nanotechnology can be the key to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional techniques of synthesizing nanomaterials/nanocomposites. Sustainable nano-synthesis routes, based on plant extracts, are considered as low-cost, simple, and availability of the raw materials. It is worthy to mention that the used plant parts should have no economic or medicinal values.\nSuch green route is not only reducing the nano-production cost but also preventing/avoiding the environmental pollution from harsh chemicals, reagents, etc. Various synthesis parameters influence the final product of nanomaterials such as type, concentration of plant extract, reaction time, and pH. The synthesis mechanism depends mainly on the concentration of the existing phytochemicals in the plant extracts. The phytochemicals as quercetin and eugenol can reduce the precursor ions to nanosize and capping of the produced nanomaterials.\nThe sustainable nanomaterials have the potential for many applications either in energy or water. It has been found that most nanomaterials/nanocomposites could be effective in remediation of water or wastewater. The advantages of sustainable nanomaterials’ application in remediations can be summarized as cost-effective, high removal efficiencies, and usage of small amounts. As a concluding remark, this chapter may help and guide the researchers for further investigations in the green nanotechnology. The future aspects in this field are summarized to be explored.\n1. Further investigations are required in the nanoscience because it would promote the development of sustainable methods to generate nanostructures of various shapes and sizes from renewable and biodegradable precursors. 2.

    "abstractText" : "Future environmental applications require the integration of green and sustainable nanomaterials. Hence, this chapter highlights the basics of nanotechnology and summarizes the synthesis of green nanomaterials compared to the conventional routes of nanomaterials. Nano-characterization techniques have been classified to identify/confirm the synthesized nanomaterials. A comprehensive overview about zerovalent metal nanomaterials, metal-based nanomaterials, carbonaceous nanomaterials, and nanocomposites is explored. The optimum parameters and conditions are studied. Furthermore, green synthesis mechanisms of some nanomaterials are discussed. Subsequent to an overview of various green nanomaterials, their integration for various pollutants’ removal is presented. A. E. D.
