      "text" : "Plastic product is used widely in modern life due to its many favourable properties including high durability. The production of plastic globally is on steady increase over the years at an average rate of 9% [1], thus expected to reach 451 million tons in 2020. Most of the plastic (10%) become waste after it is discarded and if not recycled or recovered, they will persist for many years due to its properties and can ‘outlive’ humans\nCONTACT Christian Ebere Enyoh cenyoh@gmail.com\n© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group\nby several hundred years [1]. For example, it takes about 450–1000 years for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to degrade while human barely lives a 100 years [1].\nPlastic pollution of ecosystems is regarded as one of the most serious environmental issues worldwide. Small-sized plastic particles [e.g nano (NP) and micro plastics (MP) with size 0.001 – < 0.1 μm and 0.1 μm−5 mm respectively] are of major concern and have gained increasing attention from scientists and the public media [2–4]. Although between these two small-sized plastic particles, NP have received less attention compared to MP due to scarcity of studies. The sources of these tiny particles could be primary (direct production for various consumer and industrial applications) or secondary from the fragmentation of larger plastic particles [5].\nWorldwide marine ecosystems have received great attention for pollution of small-size d plastic particles, while various compartments of the terrestrial ecosystems, such as the urban environment including street dust have received little attention. According to [6], solid particles with complex composition that accumulate on outdoor ground surfaces, easily re-suspended in air by traffic or wind, is regarded as street dust. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defined road deposited dust as solid particles that are generated by any mechanical processing of materials, including crushing, grinding, rapid impact, handling, detonation, and decrepitation of organic and inorganic materials such as rock, ore, and metal [7]. The production of urban street/road dusts sterns from the need to extend road traffic system due to urbanisation and increasing population. Data suggests that more than half of the world’s population resides in urban environment [8,9]. Currently street dust is regarded as a significant pollutant in the urban environment [10] and an ideal indicator of urban environmental quality as it reflects pollutants from different media such as air, water, and soil [11].\nThe major sources of MPs and NPs contamination of road deposited street dusts include washing of synthetic clothes, vehicles abrasion (mainly tire treads), construction activities, road channelising devices (traffic cones, drums, and barrels), speed bumps (made from PVCs), aeolian transport of plastic debris [12–16]. Other sources are from degradation of larger particles present in landfills via the synergistic processes of biodegradation, photodegradation, thermo-oxidative and thermal degradation as well as mechanical abrasion [17,18].\nEnvironmental fate of small-scale plastic particles is very important to comprehend properly for the appraisal of their latent capacity of dangers, yet this is confused by the way that the size, shape, density, and charge of the particles continually change after some time [19].\nNPs and MPs can absorb toxic chemicals such as heavy metals in the dust and convey it to organisms when ingested. Adult and children are both exposed to MPs and NPs in dust particle. The later may further ingest deposited dust when exhibiting pica in their attempts to explore the world around them [20] and so are constantly exposed to MPs and NPs. Pica children are thus more likely to have elevated body MPs and NPs than their non-pica counterparts [20]. To adults, complication may include genotoxicity, lung inflammation etc., which is depended on individual susceptibility [1,21]. Moreover, MPs and NPs can contribute to atmospheric particulate load when re-suspended in air by wind currents and traffic activities [16,22]. Although several studies have investigated the geochemical composition of road dust [23,24], relatively few scientific studies have assessed the quantity and types of small-sized plastic particles contained in road dust [25–29]. This paper, therefore reviewed available empirical studies on MPs and NPs in deposited road dusts with the aim\nof providing current knowledge and subsequently, providing knowledge gap and suggesting further research areas. The significance of this review is that, dusts particles can be easily ingested by humans through inhalation or contact and humans may simultaneously ingest MPs and NPs. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of their sources, pathways, and reservoirs is very important particularly for scientist studying the occurrence and fate of MPs and NPs in ecosystems as well as the general public."

Web of Science, Pubmed and Google Scholar were three major scientific databases used to search for related articles and at least one of the following keywords needed to sample appear in article’s title or abstract: ‘Dusts’, ‘Microplastics and dusts’, ‘Nanoplastics and dusts’, ‘Nanoparticles’, ‘Spectrophotometer’, ‘Microscopy’, ‘Spectroscopy’ ‘Plastic analysis’, ‘nanoplastic analysis’, ‘microplastic analysis’ and ‘microplastics and human health’ (conducted in April, 2020). One or more of the aforementioned keywords must be present in an article for the article to be included in the present review. All searches were restricted to peer-reviewed articles written in English and focused mainly on studies on microplastics and nanoplastics in deposited dusts while studies on soil and suspended dust particles were excluded.\nFollowing the keyword search, the majority of publications (96%) were published from 2010 onwards while 4% of all literature found were below 2010 (Figure 1). The numbers of studies directly quantifying MPs and NPs in road dust were 6.85 (2017–2020) and 0 % respectively. From these publications, all necessary information regarding analytical techniques, occurrence and distribution as well as human health of microplastics and nanoplastics was extracted and processed."

      "text" : "Wear surface of vehicle tyres (e.g. the tread) and road pavement are the principle sources for MPs in road dust from where polymer modified bitumen are commonly used in the wear layer and road marking paints. Notwithstanding these, general macroplastics littering along roads could be considered as a significant optional source to MPs and NPs in road dust [30]. Road dust may likewise contain plastics got from various sources in the urban focuses, among them development and building materials (e.g. artworks, foils, foams, cement composites and so on), air deposition and artificial turfs (rubber granules and artificial grass fibres) are noticeable [16,21]. Other sources may come from macroplastic littering. Nonetheless, the majority of these are yet to be studied [30,31]. However, they are interconnected and also determine fate of MPs and NPs in street dusts. The potential pathway/fate framework of MPs and NPs in road/street dust is summarised in Figure 2."

Generally, the tread is the constituted of a complex mixture of compounds wherein various kinds of rubbers normally make up 40–60% and the remaining compounds are added to give the tread necessary hardness, wear resistance, strength, elasticity and tenacity. The rubber mix of tyres for traveller autos is ordinarily a mix of styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) and polybutadiene rubber (PBR), in tyre treads of heavy vehicles natural rubber (NR) is the dominating rubber [32]."

      "text" : "As MPs and NPs are accumulating in road verges and surrounding areas, they are also, at least partially, transported away with road runoff or in aerosol during rain and/or wind events [41]. Most road runoff end up in the aquatic environment [44] while runoff in urban areas may be discharged to the combined sewer system and thereby (if not retained in gully pots or discharged through sewer overflow) end up in the domestic wastewater treatment plants [30]. During wind events, MPs and NPs may then be transported over long distances (> 100 km) from their original source and deposited in a new location. Such process have been shown and discussed in recent studies [40,45]. However, the extent of transport and dispersion is depended on particle size and climatic factors such atmospheric pressure, wind (flow and direction), temperature, rainfall and snowfall [40]. The summary of fate of MPs and NPs in road/street dust is presented in Figure 2."

      "text" : "Studies on MPs have increased over the years while relatively NPs studies have just began; there is still no standard operating procedure (SOP) for their analysis in environmental\nmedia [46,47]. Although many reports have presented different analytical techniques for small-sized plastic analysis, the difference in methods sometimes makes it difficult to compare results between studies [48]. Concerning deposited street dust, few studies have been conducted to date and methods applied in those studies are reviewed and presented in this section. The analytical process roadmap for the analysis of MPs and NPs particles in road deposited dust is presented in Figure 3.\nDuring analytical process, there is a strong risk of sample contamination, as plastic are ubiquitous in nature. Therefore, proper particle contamination prevention measures have to be taken. Ways by which this can be achieved include\n(1) using non-polymer materials for tools and setups (2) using laminar flow benches to prevent contamination from air and clothing. However, it seems unlikely to completely avoid plastic in all components, therefore,\na thorough blank value and recovery evaluation of the method should be performed."

Dust pan and brush or broom is used for collecting deposited street dust unlike for indoor dusts were a vacuum pump was recommended for sample collection [16]. The samples collected are kept in an air-tight polyethylene bag (for transport to the laboratory) to prevent contamination from suspended dust particles. On reaching the laboratory, the collected dust samples are then\nFigure 3. Analytical process roadmap for the analysis of MPs and NPs particles in road deposited dust.

The filtrate will then be treated for unwanted organic materials by digesting the samples with 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 7–8 days. 30% H2O2 solution is recommended as an ideal reagent for removing about 50% of biogenic organic matter in 1 week [49]. However, there are still some other chemicals including perchloric acid (HClO4) and nitric acid (HNO3) that can also be used (subject to preparation because aggressive chemicals like this, if not properly diluted can be destructive to the plastic particles and thus not enabling accurate identification and quantification of MPs) [1,47,50]. The volume of H2 O2 used for digestion depends on the level of organic matter (OM) and quantity of the dust sample. For example [14], from analysis observed that the dusts sample collected in Tehran, Iran contained significant OM (6.7–20.5%; analysed gravimetrically by weight loss on ignition method) and so they digested about 30 ± 0.5 g of each composite dust with 100 ± 0.5 ml of 30% H2O2 while [25,26] digested 10 and 15 g of dust samples with 35 ml of 30% H2O2. We recommend that OM of the dust samples should be determined, in order to choose the right volume of hydrogen peroxide for digestion. At the end of the digestion period (7–8 days), the vacuum-filtration process will then be used to remove residual H2O2 from the dust particles and then the filters were washed with distilled water and dried in a sand bath at 60–80°C. The process of sieving, digestion with H2O2 is classified as the pretreatment stage."

Other chemicals that may be used at this stage sodium tungstate (Na2WO4) and sodium chloride (NaCl) [1,51,52]. The separation is based on density of materials present in the sample. The ZnCl2or NaI solution introduced in the dried dust samples will make the MPs particle to float (becoming buoyant) in the solution, thus enabling separation from denser sediment (Figure 4) [16,53] The use of ZnCl2/NaI for floating is highly recommended by researchers because of its proven efficiency in separating densely packed complex environmental matrices for MPs particles [54]. With slight agitation for 5 minutes [14], applied about 100 ml of ZnCl2 while 50 ml of NaIsolution was used by [25,26] and were able to separate the dust samples in their respective studies. The supernatant formed from this process can then be carefully filtered using a filter paper (and air-dried perhaps in a crucible) to collected MPs and transferred into petri dishes for quantification and identification. The separation stage should be repeated at least three times to increase accuracy [14,25,26]."

However, available studies on road deposited dust samples have only used fluorescence microscopy, polarised light\nmicroscopy (PLM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and visual sorting using binocular microscope (Table 1).

      "text" : "Similar process used in MPs pre-treatment is also followed for NPs analysis, then difference in techniques begins from the pre-concentration and separation stages (Figure 3). Due to the very small size and mass of NPs in the environment, the pre-concentration stage is usually inevitable during analytical process [56]. Some pre-concentration methods that have been applied or recommended include (1) membrane filtration (MF) [57,58], based on the use of membrane filter papers of very small pore sizes and effective for NPs greater than 10 nm (smaller sizes than this may be difficult to filter, since the flow rate is depended on the pore sizes). Five-step sequence having the pore sizes of 25 µm, 2.5 µm, 0.45 µm and two times of 0.1 µm for membrane filtration has been performed for PE nanoplastic particles (24–52 nm) isolation from facial scrubs [59]. To avoid a fast clogging of the pores this filtration cascade is helpful; (2) ultrafiltration (UF), involves use of pressured (to facilitate flow rate) filtration through a nano-porous membrane (range of 5–50 nm) on samples of NPs. Researchers such as [56,60,61] and [61] have applied this method in studying of NPs (< 1.2 µm) from artificially produced MPs in aquatic environment (3) ultracentrifugation (UC), in principle is based on particle sedimentation from suspension into a pellets by application of high centrifugal forces (100,000 g) on small\nFigure 4.

      "text" : "To separate NPs in samples, researchers have suggested techniques such as magnetic field flow fractionation (MFFF), gel electrophoresis (GE), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), asymmetric flow field flow fractionation (AF4), Hydrodynamic chromatography (HDC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) [53,55]. Some of these techniques are developed for engineered nanoparticles [64] and could prove to be effective for environmental NPs separation.\nIn MFFF, the method take advantages of magnetic properties of small sized plastics due to their hydrophobicity [1], by using sample of nanoparticles (e.g coated with stable and strongly magnetic metal e.g iron, Fe or platinum Pt) to magnetised them and finally using magnetic fields to separate (magnetic extraction) and isolate them (Figure 5) [65]. The NPs particles are usually pulled tangentially to the flow direction [53,66]. In Figure 5, particles that interact weakly with the magnetic field have a large average layer thickness (ρA) and elute at shorter times; strong interaction results in smaller layer thickness (ρB) and longer retention times [67].\nThe retention of particle is a dimensionless parameter (λ), which is directly related to particle properties by\nλ ¼ 4d=wð ÞðkbT=μΔHÞ 2 (1)\nwhich include diameter (d in nm) and flow medium (w in m), absolute temperature (T, in K), Boltzmann’s constant (kb, in J/K), the magnetic moment (µ, in J/T) and change in magnetic field strength across the medium (∆H in T) [67,68] [65]. applied the MFFF methods and recorded recovery rate of 78% for polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polyurethane (PUR), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polypropylene (PP) in sediments. Overall, the method is very effective for any particles with size < 20 µm to as low as 1 nm [[65,66]]. The technique is similar with the AF4 except that, AF4 contains only one permeable wall so the cross-flow is caused only by the carrier liquid [69]\nGel electrophoresis (GE) as a separation technique for NPs is based on the charges on its surfaces, as it move through a gel with an electric field (Figure 6). The gel is a biomolecule and it is associated with the positive or negative electrical charges [70,71]. The velocity (v) of a particle (eq. 2) is dependent mainly on the electrical field strength (E), the particle net charge (q) and coefficient of friction (f) (depended on size and mass of particle, compactness and porosity of the gel).\nv ¼ E:q=f (2)\nEven though, the separation seems useable, the technique is not specifically designed for plastic separation and will likely present challenges in analysis especially when other charged particles are present. The CE technique adopts similar mechanism as GE, except that the particle travels through a column containing an electrolyte solution [71–73].\nThe SEC is applied to separate particles in a sample by size and sometimes on molecular weight. SEC is not plastic-specific just like GE and CE. The sample is passed through a column of porous beads [74]. Smaller particles are slowed since they have to pass through the porous matrix of the beads while larger particles pass around the beads. Therefore, smaller particles exit the column last [74]. HPLC and HDC is a solution-phase liquid chromatographic separation method based on the size of particles in solution. The separation can be conducted in open tube, a column packed with solid beads, or a column packed with porous beads with a pore size that is substantially smaller than the size of the particle in solution [75].\nThe use of these techniques in separation stage are somewhat determined by the size category of the NPs. For example, between ranges of 1 nm-1 µm, AF4 was best suited;\nFigure 5. Diagram of the MFFF separation mechanism for very small sized particle magnetised with coated nanoparticle and flowed in a capillary channel with an applied magnetic field.\nHDC for 5 nm-1.2 µm; SEC for 1 nm-100 nm; HPLC for 1 nm-40 nm and CE for 5 nm-500 nm [55].

      "heading" : "5. Occurrence of MPs and NPs in deposited street dust",
      "text" : "To date few studies have assessed road deposited street dust for MPs contamination while none on NPs. The reason for lack of studies on NPs could be due to the difficulty in characterising plastic particles in nano scale mainly due to lack of SOP. From literature search six studies have been conducted in seven different countries. This clearly shows that there are needs for more studies covering more regions of the world. The summary of findings in those studies is presented in Table 1.\nFigure 7. Human exposure pathway to micro and nano plastics in deposited street dust (Modified from [25]).\nTo the best of our knowledge, the first report on the quantification of MPs in road deposited street dust was conducted by [14] published in environmental science and pollution research [14]. collected street dust samples from central district of Tehran, Iran and after necessary pretreatment, characterisation was done using fluorescence microscopy, and visual sorting by binocular microscope. They reported that the concentrations ranged from 88 to 605 MPs/30 g of dust within the size range of < 100 µm to 5 mm. From the total MPs counted in the dust samples, 12.5% were in the size fraction of 100–250 µm, 33.7% in size fraction of 250–500 µm while 25.7% were > 1000 µm. The shape of MPs in the samples were mainly fibres (33.5%) and granules (65.9%) with different colours including yellowish white, dark blue, light blue, transparent, white and red. They concluded by suggesting the need for further studies, highlighting the difficulty in characterising particles less than 50 µm (most susceptible size for ingestion and inhalation from resuspension in air). In the same year [25], published a paper which aimed also at quantifying MPs (including microrubbers; MRs) in street dusts in Bushehr city, Iran. Using similar analytical methods as earlier report [14], they reported higher concentrations which ranged from 210 to 1658 MPs per 10 g dust and 44 to 782 MRs per 10 g dust, even though the location has less population (298,945) cum lesser industrial activities compared to Tehran (8.2 million). Majority of MPs recorded were fibres (75.87%) and fragments (17.5%) while MRs was also fragments (61.4%) and fibres (34.73%) with colour types including white/transparent, yellow/orange, red/pink, blue/green, and black/grey [25]. More recently [26], further studied MPs and MRs in street dusts collected from Asaluyeh County (75,000 population), Iran following the same procedure described in their previous study. They reported concentrations of 900 MPs per 15 g of dust and 250 MRs per 15 g of dust. The shape of microplastics identified were fibre, fragments, granules and film with different colour types including white-transparent, yellow-orange, red-pink, bluegreen or black-grey (Table 1).\nIn Berlin, Germany, large concentrations of Tire and road wear particles were found in street dusts by [27,28] using the FTIR techniques reported concentrations of 2500, 4100 and 3900 MPs/30 g of dust collected from different countries in Asia viz Japan, Vietnam and Nepal respectively [29]. recently reported concentrations ranging from 20.6 to 529.3 MPs/30 g of dust in Victoria, Australia.\nN/A: Not Available/Not found, *PES (Polyester), PP (Polypropylene), PE (Polyethylene), TRWP (Tyre and road wear particles).\nAll available studies have reported significant concentrations of MPs in deposited street dust linked to anthropogenic activities (industrial, commercial, high traffic and residential). Higher concentrations were reported in Germany (Europe) and Asia compared to studies in Iran and Australia. The reviewed studies further showed that the dust samples comprised mainly of PES (Polyester), PP (Polypropylene), PE (Polyethylene), TRWP (Tyre and road wear particles) microplastic types. However, the need for more studies on MPs in street dust considering the role of dust as a reflector of pollutants from different media such as air, water and soil cannot be over emphasised."

      "heading" : "6. Toxic chemicals sorped on MPs and NPs in street dust",
      "text" : "As pointed earlier, street dusts are solid particles with complex composition, thus containing varieties of chemicals including heavy metals (HM) and organic pollutants. MPs and\nNPs have large surface-to-volume ratio [as high as 4.37 m2/g [82] which makes them a good sorbent for toxic chemicals adsorption in the environment. However, the attachment is depended plastic types and surface structures which control the affinities to pollutants [1]. Toxic chemicals such as heavy metals and hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) are attached by physical interaction. Therefore, desorption of the attached chemicals can occur easily post ingestion or during transport to a new environment by wind [40]. The plausible mechanism by which toxic chemicals get attached on MPs and NPs surface include hydrophobic adsorption, through formed biofilm and plastic additives [1]. There are many studies to have quantified heavy metal levels attached on MPs surface collected in different ecosystem while studies does not exist for deposited street dust. The closes study was conducted by [25] when they quantified road deposited dust containing 210–1658 MPs/10 g Dust and 44–782 (MRs)/10 g Dust for heavy metals as well. From analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS),they reported significant levels which ranged from 4100 to 7000 mg/kg for Al, 4.3 to 24.6 mg/kg for As, 0.22 to 0.62 mg/kg for Cd, 0.22 to 0.62 mg/kg for Co, 27.1 to 67.9 mg/kg for Co, 23.66 to 478.74 mg/kg for Cu, 8800 to 29,000 mg/kg for Fe, 0.03 to 1.72 mg/kg for Hg, 261 to 422 mg/kg for Mn, 1.24 to 74.26 mg/kg for Mo,24.4 to 43.9 mg/kg for Ni,21.21 to 200.13 mg/kg for Pb, 0.64 to 12.79 mg/kg for Sb, 1.2 to 2 mg/kg for Sc, 150 to 270 mg/kg for Ti and 95.1 to 941.5 mg/kg for Zn. Similar concentrations have been quantified on MPs surfaces collected in different media (reviewed by [1]). The need for studies quantifying toxic chemicals such HM and HOCs sorped on MPs and NPs surfaces in road deposited street dust cannot be over emphasised as they can be easily ingested or inhaled."

      "heading" : "7. Exposure and health risk of small-sized plastic in street dust",
      "text" : "Studies so far have shown that road deposited street dusts contain significant amount MPs and can serve as a significant exposure route of MPs to human and ecosystems [14,26]. Exposure to humans may come by dermal contact, inhalation and ingestion [26]. These pathways of exposure have been critically discussed in recent studies [16,83].\nHuman exposure pathway to MPs and NPs in tandem toxic pollutants is presented in Figure 7. Once plastic particles find its way into the human body, particle localisation, microbial effect (biofilm with associated toxins) or chemical toxicity (with associated toxic chemicals) may occur to the individual [1,83–86]. The plausible effects may results to lung inflammation as well as primary and secondary genotoxicity [87]. However, these plausible effects are depended on the quantity of particle and type ingested as well as individual susceptibility. A recent study using human breathing thermal mannequin showed that particles up to 274 maybe consumed from inhaling indoor air over 24 hours [88]. So from dust particles in an urban environment, the values may be doubled. Fortunately, it has been suggested that over 90% of ingested particles is excreted from the human body [84]. More recent in vitro studies have demonstrated the potential effects of MPs and NPs on human-derived cells [83,89–91]. These effects ranged from inflammation to DNA damage. These pathways are involved in modulating cell inflammatory and proliferation. These studies defined the toxicity of small-sized plastic particles to humanderived cell and the resulting damage to DNA and inflammatory diseases. Further, providing a new insight into the understanding of the toxicity effects of MPs and NPs\ninduced intestinal inflammatory diseases. However, further studies are needed to clarify the internalisation process of MPs and NPs on human health."

      "heading" : "8. Conclusion",
      "text" : "The current review presented an overview of information on the presence of microplastics and nanoplastics on road deposited street dust. Overall, few studies (n = 6) have been conducted to date. These studies have shown that MPs are present in significant quantities in street dusts comprised of PES (Polyester), PP (Polypropylene), PE (Polyethylene), TRWP (Tyre and road wear particles). The concentrations of the particles are controlled by the extent of human activities while studies on NPs are currently lacking. Analytical techniques adopted in studies include fluorescence microscopy, polarised light microscopy (PLM), SEM and visual sorting using binocular microscope while NPs include atomic force microscopy-infrared (AFM-IR), ATR-FTIR, Pyr-GCMS, TDS-GCMS and thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry (TED-GC-MS). There is clear need for more studies on MPs and NPs in road deposited street dusts as these pathway present a significant route of exposure to MPs and NPs and also in tandem with other toxic pollutants such as heavy metals and organic pollutants."

There is therefore need for more studies in other countries/region of the world. ● In dust, many pollutants aside MPs and NPs, are present including toxic metals and organic pollutants. Studies quantifying this pollutants attached on their surface should be conducted. ● There is need for further studies elucidating role of MPs and NPs as sinks or sources of metals and organic pollutants in urban environment ● Could toxic chemicals be transferred between MPs and/or NPs particles and human tissue? Further study is required to evaluate the possibility of toxic chemical transfer between the plastic carrier particles and the human tissues. ● What is the extent of MPs and NPs pollution and what type in terms of shape, size, length and colour is most abundant in street dust? ● Standard method should be developed for the analysis of MPs and NPs in street dust.\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nORCID\nChristian Ebere Enyoh http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4132-8988"

    "abstractText" : "Urban street dust is regarded as a significant pollutant in the urban environment and an ideal indicator of urban environmental quality. Even so, studies regarding this matrix for microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) pollution are often overlooked and only a few studies have been conducted to date. MPs and NPs are ubiquitous in nature and of current concern to scientists, governmental and nongovernmental organisation. A key issue in understanding the fate and potential effects of MPs and NPs is their dynamic nature, as the size, shape, and charge of the particles change overtime. Reviewed studies suggested that they are present in significant quantities in deposited street dust comprised mainly of PES (Polyester), PP (Polypropylene), PE (Polyethylene), TRWP (Tire and road wear particles) and the concentrations are influenced by anthropogenic activities. These studies therefore suggest dusts as a significant exposure route of human and ecosystem to MPs and NPs. The present review provided a comprehensive overview of current knowledge or information including analytical procedure regarding MPs and NPs in road deposited street dust, identifying gaps in knowledge, and giving suggestions for future research. The significance of this review is that, dusts particles can be easily ingested by humans through inhalation or contact and humans may simultaneously ingest MPs and NPs. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of their sources, pathways, and reservoirs is very important particularly for scientist studying the occurrence and fate of MPs and NPs in ecosystems as well as the general public.
