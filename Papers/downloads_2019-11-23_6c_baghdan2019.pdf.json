However, most photosensitizers are administered intravenously with very few reports about pulmonary applications. To address this issue, an inhalable formulation consisting of nanoparticles loaded with photosensitizer (i.e. curcumin) was developed. The nanoparticles were prepared using nanoprecipitation method. Dynamic light scattering measurements of the curcumin loaded nanoparticles revealed a hydrodynamic diameter of 181.20 ± 11.52 nm. In vitro irradiation experiments with human lung epithelial carcinoma cells (A549) showed a selective cellular toxicity of the nanoparticles upon activation using LED irradiating device. Moreover, curcumin nanoparticles exhibited a dose-dependent photocytotoxicity and the IC50 values of curcumin were directly dependent on the radiation fluence used. The nanoparticles were subsequently spray dried using mannitol as a stabilizer to produce Nano-in-Microparticles with appropriate aerodynamic properties for a sufficient deposition in the lungs. This was confirmed using the next generation impactor, which revealed a large fine particle fraction (64.94 ± 3.47%) and a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 3.02 ± 0.07 μm. Nano-in-Microparticles exhibited a good redispersibility and disintegrated into the original nanoparticles upon redispersion in aqueous medium. The Langmuir monolayer experiments revealed an excellent compatibility of the nanoparticles with the lung surfactant. Results from this study showed that the Nano-in-Microparticles are promising drug carriers for the photodynamic therapy of lung cancer."

      "text" : "According to the world health organization (WHO), lung cancer is a leading cause of death globally. Despite the improvements in survival rates shown by traditional treatments like surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy (Johnson et al., 2014), the search for a more effective yet patient-friendly therapy continues. Recently, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an evolving therapeutic strategy against cancer.\nWith its high safety profile and minimally invasive nature, PDT offers several advantages over conventional treatments, which are normally associated with systemic toxicity and undesirable side effects (Brown et al., 2004; Juarranz et al., 2008). Bronchoscopic PDT is one of the methods used in the endoluminal treatment of lung cancer. It involves the administration of a photoactive substance (i.e. photosensitizer) followed by illumination of the tumor mass with light of a specific wavelength using a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope.

Therefore, researchers have focused on developing more efficient and selective nanoformulations with controlled release properties (Paszko et al., 2011; Mahmoud et al., 2015; Mahmoud et al., 2017). Furthermore, a suitable route of administration must be chosen, so that the photosensitizer reaches its target tissue and accumulates in therapeutic concentrations. Although PDT has been effectively employed to treat several types of lung cancer (Moghissi, 2004), intravenous administration is still the route of choice for most of the clinically approved photosensitizers with only a few reports of pulmonary drug delivery (van Straten et al., 2017).\nConsequently, an opportunity exists to use photosensitizer loaded nanoformulations exploiting the numerous advantages of lung delivery such as: being non-invasive route of administration, a lower administered dose and minimum systemic exposure of drug intended for local application (Liang et al., 2015). These nanoformulations, however, must have specific physicochemical properties (e.g. appropriate aerodynamic particle size) to overcome the biological barriers of the lung (Chow et al., 2007; Patton et al., 2010). Various strategies have been developed to transform nanocarriers into inhalable formulations that can be administered using dry powder inhalers, metered-dose inhalers, or nebulizers (Yang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2011).\nIn the last decade, Nano-in-Microparticles (NiMps) emerged as an interesting drug carrier with superior aerodynamic properties and a higher deposition in the lungs. NiMps are microparticles consisting of two main components: nanoparticles and an excipient (e.g. mannitol or trehalose) serving as a wall material to embed the nanoparticles and stabilize them during the atomization process used to produce a more stable dry powder form (Bohr et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017). Spray drying is still the main preparation method of NiMps for many reasons: being a single-step technique with variable process parameters and suitable for thermolabile substances especially proteins and polymers with low glass transition temperatures (Vehring, 2008; Baghdan et al., 2018). Several studies have reported the feasibility of preparing NiMps by spray drying nanoparticles to produce a dry powder for inhalation and preserve the physicochemical characteristics of the original nanoparticles (Grenha et al., 2007; Lebhardt et al., 2011; Tewes et al., 2014; Torge et al., 2017).\nThe aim of this work was to develop a photosensitizer loaded formulation in the form of a dry powder for inhalation. This, together with bronchoscopic PDT would offer an effective treatment against lung cancer. Curcumin was chosen as naturally occurring photosensitizer with diverse applications in the field of PDT (Zorofchian Moghadamtousi et al., 2014). To increase its selectivity and expand its range of application, curcumin has been encapsulated within nanoformulations (e.g. liposomes or nanoparticles) (Pinnapireddy et al., 2017; Duse et al., 2018a; Duse et al., 2018b). In this study, curcumin loaded nanoparticles were prepared and subjected to several characterizations to determine their size, surface charge, morphology, and phototoxic effect. Subsequently, curcumin nanoparticles were transformed into a dry powder for inhalation utilizing spray drying and their morphology, aerodynamic properties and compatibility with pulmonary surfactant were investigated. Formulating curcumin inhalable powder in the form of NiMps rather than single component (curcumin only) microparticles will offer several advantages. Initially NiMps are microparticles with desirable aerodynamic properties facilitating a sufficient pulmonary deposition. Upon contact with lung fluids, they disintegrate into nanoparticles that are advantageous especially in terms of cellular internalization and evading macrophage uptake (Yang et al., 2008; Lebhardt et al., 2011; Muralidharan et al., 2015; Mangal\net al., 2017)."

Using the naturally-derived pulmonary surfactant; Alveofact®, alveoli specific surface pressures could be generated. The surface pressure (π) is the difference between the surface tension of pure water (γ0) and the measured surface tension (γ) (Eq. (3)).\n= 0 (3)\nSurface pressure measurements in the film balance (Riegler & Kirstein GmbH, Potsdam, Germany; Teflon trough 100ml total volume and total area of 171 cm2) were performed according to Wilhelmymethod (Bakowsky et al., 2000). Alveofact® was dissolved in cyclohexane to a final concentration of 1mg/ml. PBS (pH 7.4, filtered through 0.2 μm syringe filter) was used as the subphase (i.e. the aqueous medium on which the monolayer will spread). All experiments were performed at 25 °C. Five minutes after spreading Alveofact® on the surface, the monolayer was formed. The monolayer was compressed, and the total surface area was reduced to generate two different surface pressures (i.e. 25 mN/m and 42mN/m). Afterwards, the monolayer was left to stabilize for 15min. The redispersed nanoparticles were then injected under the monolayer into the subphase (Fig. 1). The π-t (pressure-time) isotherms were recorded by a control unit (Riegler & Kirstein).\nThe utilization of two-dimensional lipid model membranes is a welldocumented and frequently used approach for characterizing drugmembrane interactions. In order to obtain comparable results to those of 3D systems (e.g. differential scanning calorimetry), the ideal gas law i.e. PV=nRT or PA=nRT (in case of 2D systems, where: P is the lateral film pressure, and A is the molecular area) is used to adjust the parameters. In monolayer systems, only temperatures which are slightly above room temperature can reasonably be produced, the lateral\npressure (P) and the molecular area (A) were adjusted to be equivalent to those of a temperature of 37 °C. This ensures that the same fluidity and identical diffusion coefficients can be achieved as in case of 3D system with a temperature of 37 °C.\nIn this regard, it is worth mentioning that an experimental setup where the particles are aerosolized on the film balance would describe the situation in the lungs more correctly. However, due to the fact that spraying on the conventional film balance would be problematic, especially in terms of monolayer stability, there is still no validated technique available with such a setup."

PLGA is approved by FDA and EMA for drug delivery applications with several products in the market. Moreover, PLGA has been proven to be safe for pulmonary drug delivery according to several in vitro and in vivo studies (Danhier et al., 2012; Ungaro et al., 2012; Martins et al., 2018). To the best of our knowledge, there is still no PLGA-based approved products for pulmonary applications with no reports about clinical trials in this regard.\nPreliminary experiments were performed to improve the preparation method by optimizing the parameters which had significant effect on particle size, dispersity, and encapsulation efficiency (e.g. concentration of PLGA, concentration of PVA and curcumin loading). DLS and LDV measurements did not indicate any significant effect of curcumin encapsulation on particle size, polydispersity index (PdI) or ζpotential (p > 0.05). Both unloaded and loaded nanoparticles had a similar hydrodynamic diameter with monodisperse size distribution (PdI≤ 0.1) and a negative surface charge (Table 1).\nPLGA nanoparticles have been previously reported to have the ability to efficiently encapsulate curcumin (Yallapu et al., 2010). Spectrophotometric quantification revealed that 2.5% loading of curcumin (%wt of the polymer) is the most appropriate concentration leading to a relatively high encapsulation efficiency (Table 1). Moreover, when higher curcumin concentrations were used (≥5%), a yellowish-orange ring appeared on the inside of the beaker. The width of the formed ring increased proportionately with increasing the concentration of curcumin due to higher amounts of free curcumin that were precipitating on the beaker while evaporating the solvent.\nSEM micrographs of PLGA.CUR.NPs showed that the nanoparticles were spherical and had a homogenous size distribution with few larger particles which were not detected with DLS (Fig. 2A). Average particle size was around 160 nm which is slightly smaller than the size obtained from DLS measurements. This difference in particle size can be attributed to sample preparation and measurement principle since DLS measurements were performed while the nanoparticles were still suspended in a dispersant (e.g. water or buffer), whereas in case of SEM, the samples were left to dry first (Gaumet et al., 2008)."

Matrix excipients other than mannitol have been also used in the preparation of PLGA-based inhalable NiMps, e.g. lactose, trehalose and chitosan (El-Sherbiny and Smyth, 2012; Bohr et al., 2015). However, using polycationic polymers like chitosan as a matrix substance will lead to electrostatic interactions with the anionic lipids in the lung surfactant and critically influencing their surface activity (Zuo et al., 2008; Kang et al., 2008).\nRedispersibility of NiMps was evaluated by redispersing the sprayed powder in water. DLS measurements of the redispersed nanoparticles\nrevealed a particle size of 233.41 ± 24.22 nm and PdI of 0.23 ± 0.03. This increase in particle size and PdI could be due to slight aggregation caused by shear forces during the atomization step. Similar findings were observed by Lebhardt et al. as they measured the size of the PLGA nanoparticles collected directly after atomization (without heating) and reported a size increase of approximately 9%. An increase in the PDI values was also noticed (Lebhardt et al., 2011). However, several parameters must still be investigated in order to better understand the reason behind the size increase of the redispersed nanoparticles after spray drying. A very crucial parameter indeed is the amount of mechanical force (e.g. vortexing or sonication) that is required to sufficiently redisperse the centrifuged nanoparticles in the solution of the matrix excipient. Other factors should also be studied, e.g. type of matrix excipient, Nanoparticles:Matrix mass ratio and the spray drying parameters, especially feed rate and spray air flow.\nEven after storage for almost five months, NiMps were readily dispersible confirming the benefit of spray drying in improving long-term stability of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, mannitol plays a vital role in increasing the space between the nanoparticles which will reduce particle-particle interactions and improve the disintegration of the microparticles (Wang et al., 2017).\nSEM micrographs of NiMps (Fig. 2B and C) showed raisin-like particles with wrinkled morphology and relatively broad particle size distribution ranging from 0.5 to 4 μm.\nSimilar morphological findings were previously reported by Torge et al. where the influence of nanoparticle-to-mannitol ratio on the morphology of PLGA-based NiMps was investigated. The study reported testing several Nanoparticles:Matrix ratios ranging from 0% to 100% nanoparticle percentage. According to the findings of the study, only pure mannitol particles had a spherical shape, whereas the incorporation of nanoparticles at all ratios led to the formation of less spherical\nand more collapsed particles (Torge et al., 2017). Additional details about NiMps structure were obtained from CLEM imaging which served as a confirmation of the nanoparticle distribution within the microparticles (Fig. 2D). Moreover, using CLSM, it was also possible to confirm the ability of mannitol to embed nanoparticles homogenously by analyzing each fluorescence channel separately since the nanoparticles were loaded with curcumin and mannitol was labeled with Rhodamine B (Fig. 5). Previous studies reported similar results with mannitol and different types of nanoparticles (Grenha et al., 2007; Torge et al., 2017)."

      "text" : "The pulmonary deposition of inhaled particles is significantly controlled by their aerodynamic properties. An aerodynamic diameter between 1 and 5 μm will help achieving higher particle deposition in the lung especially in the lower airways (Bohr et al., 2014). NiMps were characterized using NGI which is one of the devices recommended by the European Pharmacopoeia for aerodynamic assessment of fine particles. NiMps exhibited good aerosolization behavior with MMAD of 3.02 ± 0.07 μm within the desirable range and high FPF (64.94 ± 3.47%). GSD was found to be 1.74 ± 0.16 indicating a polydisperse powder which was also noticed in SEM micrographs. This GSD value, however, falls within the typical range for most pharmaceutical aerosols (i.e. 1.5–2.5) (Newman et al., 2009). NGI results proved the ability of NiMps to deliver the nanoparticles efficiently to the lungs omitting the need of additional excipients like coarse carrier particles (e.g. lactose) or aerosolization enhancer (e.g. amino acids). Following deposition NiMps will come in contact with lung fluids. Depending on their deposition site, the particles have to pass the mucus blanket within the airways or pulmonary surfactant layer lining the alveolar epithelium to reach their target (Yang et al., 2008). In this regard, the interaction of NiMps with a monolayer of bovine lung surfactant (Alveofact®) was investigated using Langmuir film balance. Two different surface pressures were used to simulate the interaction of the redispersed nanoparticles with pulmonary surfactant during the breathing process (Wüstneck et al., 2005). The pure monolayers were in continuous phase at those pressures. Fig. 6 shows the π-t isotherm of pure Alveofact® dynamically compressed up to a surface pressure of 25mN/m (A) and 42mN/m (B) at a velocity of 20 cm2/min. After reaching the desired surface pressure, the barriers were stopped so that the Alveofact® monolayer could equilibrate. The properties of the Alveofact® monolayer were then monitored for 60min. Directly after the barriers stopped, the π-t isotherms of pure Alveofact® decreased by 1–2mN/m. This was caused by a new array of lipids in the monolayer after the dynamic compression or due to other processes like relaxation\nand desorption (Rodríguez Niño et al., 2008). Subsequently, the monolayer equilibrated and the surface pressures stabilized. The gray curves represent the π-t isotherms where 20 μl of the redispersed nanoparticles were added 15min after the barriers were stopped. After the injection of the nanoparticles, no change in the π-t isotherm could be observed at both tested surface pressures, suggesting no substantial interaction between the nanoparticles and surfactant. In other words, integration of the nanoparticles into the surfactant monolayer would have caused an increase in the surface pressure over time, and vice versa, a decrease in the surface pressure would mean that the nanoparticles have either withdrawn the compounds out of the monolayer or destroyed it (Bakowsky et al., 2000). These outcomes confirmed that NiMps with all its components (nanoparticles and mannitol) are compatible with pulmonary surfactant at physiological pressures.\nThe fate of PLGA nanoparticles and their elimination rate are very important points that still need to be addressed. There are numerous possibilities, e.g. degradation, macrophage uptake and clearance, or exhalation. However, it is difficult to exactly tell which one is dominant in our case due to the lack of details in the scientific literature in this regard. The only available reports are based either on ex vivo lung models or in vivo studies and in all cases PLGA nanoparticles were administered as nanoparticle suspension (by means of nebulization for example) rather than in the form of Nano-in-Microparticles as a dry powder for inhalation. However, in order to better understand the fate and the pharmacokinetics of PLGA nanoparticles, there is still an urgent need for in vivo studies wherein Nano-in-Microparticles are administered via the pulmonary route as a dry powder for inhalation."

      "text" : "In the present work, spray drying was employed to transform curcumin loaded nanoparticles into a more stable dry powder for inhalation without experiencing drastic conditions. Mannitol was used as the wall material embedding the nanoparticles to keep them intact during the drying process and facilitate their release from the microparticles. The produced Nano-in-Microparticles offer double benefit; nanoparticles efficiently encapsulating curcumin to enhance its therapeutic efficacy and microparticles serving as an intermediate carrier with suitable aerodynamic properties for sufficient deposition in the lung. Furthermore, the good compatibility of the Nano-in-Microparticles with pulmonary surfactant is an important prerequisite for the safe delivery of curcumin to its site of action in the lungs (i.e. tumor cells). The outcomes of this study confirmed the feasibility of preparing an inhalable curcumin formulation that can be applied in combination with bronchoscopic photodynamic therapy. This will help achieving both selective and completely non-invasive treatment against lung cancer.\nThus, offering a promising alternative to the intravenous route and improving patient compliance.\nDeclarations of interest\nNone."

However, most photosensitizers are administered intravenously with very few reports about pulmonary applications. To address this issue, an inhalable formulation consisting of nanoparticles loaded with photosensitizer (i.e. curcumin) was developed. The nanoparticles were prepared using nanoprecipitation method. Dynamic light scattering measurements of the curcumin loaded nanoparticles revealed a hydrodynamic diameter of 181.20 ± 11.52 nm. In vitro irradiation experiments with human lung epithelial carcinoma cells (A549) showed a selective cellular toxicity of the nanoparticles upon activation using LED irradiating device. Moreover, curcumin nanoparticles exhibited a dose-dependent photocytotoxicity and the IC50 values of curcumin were directly dependent on the radiation fluence used. The nanoparticles were subsequently spray dried using mannitol as a stabilizer to produce Nano-in-Microparticles with appropriate aerodynamic properties for a sufficient deposition in the lungs. This was confirmed using the next generation impactor, which revealed a large fine particle fraction (64.94 ± 3.47%) and a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 3.02 ± 0.07 μm. Nano-in-Microparticles exhibited a good redispersibility and disintegrated into the original nanoparticles upon redispersion in aqueous medium. The Langmuir monolayer experiments revealed an excellent compatibility of the nanoparticles with the lung surfactant. Results from this study showed that the Nano-in-Microparticles are promising drug carriers for the photodynamic therapy of lung cancer.",
