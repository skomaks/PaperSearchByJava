All rights reserved.\na b s t r a c t\nThe dehydrogenation reaction pathway and rate-limiting step of a nano-LiBH4 þ nano-MgH2 mixture with a 0.5:1molar ratio, which has been shown to have the ability to reversibly release and absorb ~5.7 wt% H2 at 265 C, have been investigated in detail. The study reveals that the solid-state dehydrogenation kinetics of the MgH2 þ 0.5 LiBH4 mixture at 265 C is nucleation-and-growth controlled. The rate-limiting step for dehydrogenation via the two parallel reaction pathways has been identified through examination of the elementary reactions as the nucleation and growth of reaction products LiH and MgB2. The interfacial area between MgH2 and LiBH4 plays a critical role in the nucleation and growth of LiH and MgB2, and thus influence the dehydrogenation kinetics and H2 storage capacity of the MgH2 þ 0.5 LiBH4 mixture. X-ray diffraction, SEM analysis and specific surface area measurements reveal that the evolution of the powder characteristics before and after isothermal hydrogen uptake/release cycles is consistent with the kinetics observation and analysis. This study indicates that to further improve the dehydrogenation kinetics of the MgH2 þ LiBH4 mixture, the nucleation and growth rates of LiH and/or MgB2 should be enhanced in the future, while the interfacial area between MgH2 and LiBH4 should be increased and maintained to be as large as possible during hydrogen uptake/release cycles.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "The research about reversible hydrogen storage materials has attracted more and more attention in the past two decades [1e8]. Currently, researchers all over the world have shown their extreme interests in LiBH4 due to its high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen densities of 18.5 wt% and 121 kg H2/m3, respectively [9]. However, its unfavorable thermodynamics and sluggish kinetics for dehydrogenation have limited its potential application for on-board application of fuel cell vehicles [10]. Under such background, studies on lowering the temperature of hydrogen release have become popular.\nCurrently, there are four major approaches that have been tried to modify the thermodynamics and/or kinetics of dehydrogenation from LiBH4. These include: (i) seeking novel catalysts to enhance hydrogen release kinetics [11], (ii) employment of nanoengineering, either using mesoporous scaffolds to confine LiBH4 in nanoscales or mixing nanotubes and mesoporous gels with LiBH4 [12], (iii) thermodynamic destabilization of LiBH4 via the partial\nsubstitution of Li cations by other cations with larger electronegativity [13], and (iv) introduction of additives to stabilize the dehydrogenated state, thereby thermodynamically destabilizing LiBH4 [14,15]. Among these four approaches, the last one shows great promise because it not only tunes the thermodynamics, but also improves the kinetics. It is worth noting that similar approach called ball-milling process assisted by dielectric-barrier discharge plasma has already shown the dual-tuning effects of the thermodynamics and kinetics for Mg-based hydrogen storage materials [16e18]. It has been shown that introduction of additive(s) to LiBH4 has the potential to store and release hydrogen with a theoretical capacity of 11.45wt% H2 at a relative lower temperature through the reaction shown below [19].\n2LiBH4 (s) þ MgH2 (s) ¼ 2 LiH (s) þ MgB2 (s) þ 4H2 (g) (1)\nRecently, our group has shown that the nano-MgH2 þ nanoLiBH4 mixture with molar ration of 2:1 produced from a novel process, termed as ball milling with aerosol spraying (BMAS), has the ability to release and absorb ~5.7wt% H2 at 265 C [20], which is the highest reversible H2 storage capacity ever reported for the LiBH4 þ MgH2 system in solid state [19,21e23], since the melting point of LiBH4 is 275 C. This BMAS-processed powder contains\n25 at.% LiBH4 in the mixture for the stoichiometric reaction of Eq. (1), and thus will be denoted as the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 hereafter. It is found that the unusually high reversible hydrogen storage exhibited by the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 is accomplished through two parallel reaction pathways. One is nano-MgH2 decomposes to formMg and H2 first, and thenMg reacts with LiBH4 to form MgB2, LiH and H2, as shown in reactions (2) and (3) [19].\nMgH2 (s) ¼ Mg (s) þ H2 (g) (2)\n2LiBH4 (s) þ Mg(s) ¼ 2LiH (s) þ MgB2 (s) þ 3H2 (g) (3)\nThe other reaction pathway is that nano-LiBH4 decomposes to form Li2B12H12 and H2 first and then Li2B12H12 reacts with MgH2 to form MgB2, LiH and H2, as shown in reactions (4) and (5) [24,25].\n12 LiBH4 (s)¼ Li2B12H12 (s) þ 10 LiH (s) þ 13H2 (g) (4)\nLi2B12H12 (s) þ 6 MgH2 (s)¼ 6 MgB2 (s) þ 2 LiH (s) þ 11H2 (g) (5)\nNote that Reactions (4) and (5) have been shown to take place in situ during high-energy ball milling of MgH2 at ambient temperature along with aerosol spraying of LiBH4 dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution [24]. Furthermore, these reactions can be utilized for hydrogen storage and release applications, as demonstrated lately [19,21,22].\nGiven the significantly improved hydrogen storage capacity for the LiBH4 þ MgH2 system obtained via BMAS, investigation on the reaction kinetics of dehydriding reactions from the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 is of great theoretic interest and technological importance. Thus, the dehydrogenation kinetics of the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 is analyzed for the first time in this study. In addition, the kinetics effects of all of the four elementary reactions for the two parallel dehydriding reaction pathways, i.e., reactions (2) and (3) and reactions (4) and (5), are included in the quantitative analysis. Furthermore, the powder characteristics before and after dehydriding and re-hydriding cycles are considered in order to provide additional insights into the kinetics mechanisms for the enhanced storage properties and the degradation in cycling performance. The understanding developed from this study will shed light on how to increase the dehydrogenation rate of the nanoLiBH4 þ nano-MgH2 mixture in the future."

      "text" : "The experimental rawmaterials includes MgH2 þ C mixture and LiBH4/THF solution. MgH2 þ C mixture was prepared by mixing MgH2 with hydrogen storage-grade (98%) þ 5 vol% pre-milled C (synthetic graphite) [26e31] and 2.0M LiBH4 in THF solution was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\nThe elementary diagram of the homemade automated BMAS device, together with its on-and-off program of ball milling, aerosol spraying and vacuuming, is shown in Fig. 1. The parameters used in experiments have been discussed in Ref. [20]. Note that the BMAS powder prepared for the subsequent characterizations is free from THF residue. This is achieved by vacuum (10 4MPa) drying the BMAS powder at ambient temperature for 36 h. Because THF is a volatile solvent (see Fig. S1 in Supplemental Material), 20-min holding at room temperature will lead to the complete evaporation of THF solution.\nThe Sieverts’-type pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) unit from Advanced Materials Corporation is employed to conduct dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation cycles. The PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer equipped with an incident-beam focusing mirror and an X'Celerator detector with MoKa radiation\nis employed for the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The JEOL JSM 5900-LV scanning electron microscope (SEM) is used for observing the particle morphology. Detailed experimental conditions for PCT, XRD and SEM data collection can be found elsewhere [20]. It is worth noting that the leakage of the PCT chamber is very small (see Fig. S2) and has been taken into account when calculating and reporting the hydrogen contents of the BMAS powder in dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation. The two-channel Nova Quantachrome 2200e surface area & pore size analyzer is used to determine the specific surface area (SSA) of samples at different processing stages based on the BrunauereEmmetteTeller (BET) method."

      "text" : "Dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation behaviors of the BMAS\nmixture as a function of time and temperature are shown in Fig. 2. It is clear that the mixture has a rapid hydrogen absorption rate and slowdesorption rate. Take the first cycle for an example. The release curve appears not completed yet after 10-h's holding at 265 C. In contrast, 96.9% H2 has already been absorbed in the first 2 h during the heating process to 265 C. Since dehydrogenation process is much slower than the hydrogenation process, this study focuses on the slower one so that guidelines can be provided to improve the slower process.\nIn analyzing the H2 release kinetics, one should note that the 5.7 wt% H2 released and absorbed in the first cycle is about two thirds of the theoretical storage capacity for the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 which is calculated to be about 9.1wt% H2. Second, most of the H2 is released in the isothermal (265 C) and isobaric (0.001 MPa) conditions. Thus, the analysis is performed with the assumption of isothermal and isobaric conditions. Finally, the shrinking-core model [33], which has been widely employed to investigate the kinetics of gas/solid reactions, has been utilized to analyze the possibilities of various kinetics mechanisms. The suitability of using this model will be discussed later.\nIn using the shrinking-core model, several possible rate-limiting steps that can control the reaction kinetics, which include (i) diffusion of a diffusing species through the product layer, (ii) movement of the reactant/product interface at a constant speed, (iii) nucleation and growth of the product, and (iv) desorption or adsorption of the gaseous phase at the surface of the solid particle, have been considered. The corresponding equations for these ratelimiting steps have been derived previously and are listed below [32,33]. These equations are based on examining the fraction reacted, f , as a function of holding time, t [34,35].\nð1 f Þ 1=3 ¼ 1 k 1 2 1 r t1=2 diffusion controlled reactions (6)\nð1 f Þ 1=3 ¼ 1 k2 r\nt moving interface controlled reactions (7)\nf ¼ 1 expð k3tmÞ nucleation and growth controlled reactions (8)\nf ¼ k4r2 t gas desorption controlled reactions (9)\nwhere r is the average particle size of the BMAS particles, k1, k2, k3 and k4 are the rate constants for their respective kinetics mechanisms, and m is the mechanism constant the value of which depends on the detail of nucleation and growth of the product (to be discussed in detail later). To evaluate the dehydriding kinetics at 265 C shown in Fig. 2, the incomplete dehydrogenation at the end of each isothermal dehydrogenation should be taken into account. For example, equation (6) would be modified to be\nð1 f 0,f Þ1=3 ¼1 k 1 2 1 r t1=2 (10)\nwhere f 0 is the proportion of H2 desorption at the end of the release segment of the theoretical hydrogen storage capacity of the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4, which is 9.1 wt% as mentioned previously. Thus, f ¼1 at the end of each release segment, whereas f 0 ¼ 1 only if the H2 released at the end of the release segment equals the theoretical hydrogen storage capacity of the system (i.e., 9.1 wt%). Otherwise, f 0 is smaller than 1. Similarly, equations (7)e(9) should also be modified, respectively, to be equations (11)e(13):\nð1 f 0,f Þ1=3 ¼ 1 k2 r t (11)\nf 0 , f ¼ 1 expð k3tmÞ (12)\nf 0 , f ¼ k4r2 t (13)\nnote that the determination of k3 andm constant can be done easily by re-arranging equation (12) to the following form\nln ln 1 1 f 0 f\n¼ ln k3 þm ln t (14)\nThus, a linear relationship will be present if experimental data is\nplotted in ln ln 1 1 f 0 f\nvs: ln t and the dehydrogenation ki-\nnetics is controlled by nucleation and growth processes. Under these conditions the slope of the line is equal to m, while the\ninterception of the linewith the ln ln 1 1 f 0 f\naxis gives rise to ln\nk3. Table 1 summarizes the fitting equations through the least-\nsquares method obtained from all of the dehydrogenation curves, i.e., 1R, 2R, 3R, 4R, 5R and 6R curves, shown in Fig. 2 with the assumption that the dehydrogenation kinetics is diffusion controlled. Similarly, the fitting equations for all of the\ndehydrogenation curves shown in Fig. 2 have been obtained for moving-interface controlled reactions, nucleation-and-growth controlled reactions and gas-desorption controlled reactions, and these fitting equations are listed in Tables 2e4, respectively.\nBy examining the R-square values for each possible ratecontrolling mechanism shown in Tables 1e4, it is very clear that the experimental data fits the nucleation/growth-controlled model better than the other models. This conclusion can also be easily obtained by examining Fig. 3(a), (b), (c) & (d) where the experimental data of the 5R curve in Fig. 2 is compared with the fitting equations based on the assumptions of diffusion controlled, moving-interface controlled, nucleation-and-growth controlled and gas-desorption controlled reactions, respectively. These figures show visually that nucleation-and-growth controlled reactions provide the best fit to the experimental data of the 5R curve, consistent with the R-square value analysis. The same conclusion can be attained for 1R, 2R, 3R, 4R and 6R data. Therefore, it is concluded that the dehydrogenation kinetics of the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 is controlled by nucleation and growth of the dehydrogenation products.\nTo support the conclusion above, the details of the nucleationand-growth controlled reactions are considered further. It is known that nucleation and three-dimensional growth controlled reactions are well-described by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) equation [36]. Since the smallest m obtained from the curve fitting is 3.27 (5R sample in Table 3), the growth of nuclei should be threedimensional.\nlnð1 f 0f Þ ¼ ð4p=3ÞY3 ðt\n0\nIðt tÞ3dt (15)\nwhere Y is the growth rate, I is the nucleation rate per unit volume, and t is a finite time interval. The growth rate Y is typically treated as a constant during an isothermal reaction, while the nucleation rate I is also considered as unchanged in many literatures [37e39]. However, for a more general case we relax this limitation and allow I to be a function of holding time and cycle numbers because powder characteristics change with holding time and particularly with cycle numbers. Assume I ¼ ctx and there are N0 nuclei preexisting at time t¼ 0,\nlnð1 f 0f Þ ¼ ð4p=3ÞY3 ðt\n0\nctxðt tÞ3dt (16)\nafter integration,\nlnð1 f 0f Þ ¼ ðp=3ÞY3 N0t 3 þ ct4þx\n(17)\nlet k ¼ ðp=3ÞY3, then we have\nln 1 lnð1 f 0f Þ ¼ ln kþ ln N0t 3 þ ct4þx\n(18)\nComparing Eq. (18) with Eq. (14), i.e., ln 1 lnð1 f 0f Þ ¼ ln kþm ln t,\nwhich is used for the data regression, the following qualitative arguments can be obtained.\n(i) when x¼ 0, the nucleation rate is constant as I ¼ c. In this case t4þx ¼ t4 over rules t3 and thus ln 1\nlnð1 f 0f Þ\nzln kþ\nlnðct4þxÞ ¼ ln kþ ln cþ ð4 þ xÞln t, m ¼ 4; (ii) when x>0, the nucleation rate increases with time as I ¼ ctx.\nSimilar to earlier case, t4þx dominates t3 and thus,m ¼ 4þ x. In this particular case, m will be larger than 4; (iii) when 1< x<0, the nucleation rate I ¼ ctjxj and diminished with time. t4þx leads t3 and thus,m ¼ 4þ x, lies in between 3 and 4;\n(iv) when x 1, the nucleation vanishes faster than the last case. However, here the leading order is t3 and thus, m ¼ 3.\nSummarizing the above four cases with all the scenarios included, we can conclude that the value ofm is determined by the dependence of the nucleation rate on the reaction time. There are three regimes of the m value. Between 3 and 4 (not include 4), the nucleation rate decrease as reaction continues. At m¼ 4, the nucleation rate is constant. Values larger than 4 indicate accelerating nucleation as reaction goes on. Similar results can be found in Ref. [40].\nApplying the aforementioned physical meaning ofm to the data in Table 3, the following trends can be established. For the first two dehydrogenation processes, the m values are slightly larger than 4, indicating an increased nucleation rate with time. Furthermore, the larger departure from 4 for m in the first dehydrogenation corresponds to the faster nucleation rate, suggesting that the nucleation rate for the first dehydrogenation (m¼ 4.165) is faster than that of the second one (m¼ 4.077). Starting from the third cycle, m becomes smaller than 4, implying the vanishing nucleation as reaction proceeds. It can also be seen that the fitted m values as well as the k values gradually go down with increasing cycles of dehydrogenation, suggesting the degradation of the kinetics performance. In addition, it appears that the degradation has stopped\nafter 5 cycles of dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation because both m and k values in Table 3 have little change from 5R to 6R samples. The mechanism(s) responsible for the degradation of the kinetics performance is discussed below.\nA note should be given that in our case, the nucleation involves two solid phases and takes place at the solid-solid interface. Therefore, the nucleation rate is closely related to the area of the interface, rather than the volume from the JMA equation (15). In the beginning of the experiment, the interface area is quite large because of the relatively small solid particles due to the nature of the BMAS process. As a result, the nucleation rate is fast in the first and second dehydrogenation processes. As dehydrogenation cycles increase, the solid particles grow in size and the interface area decreases in the reactants. This reasonably explains the degradation of the reaction kinetics, and more details will be discussed in Section 3.3.\nPreviously, our group has demonstrated that the rate-limiting step for solid-state dehydrogenation of the ball-milled LiBH4 þ MgH2 mixture is diffusion controlled [38]. However, the curve fitting of the diffusion-controlled model for the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 has excluded this possibility based on the following reasons. First, the R-squared values for diffusion controlled reactions are the smallest (Table 1) among all the four mechanisms investigated. Second, the first constant on the right side of the equation from the diffusion-controlled reaction is 20%e 39% deviated from 1 (i.e., 1.197e1.386) when compared with Eq. (10), whereas that constant for the moving-interface-controlled reaction is only 8%e15% (i.e., 1.075e1.147) deviated from 1 when compared with Eq. (11). This constant is required to be equal to 1 for both diffusion controlled and moving-interface controlled reactions. Otherwise, the models have no physical meaning. The\nlarger departure from 1 for the diffusion controlled reaction, combining with its unsatisfactory R-square values, helps us to rule out the possibility of the diffusion control reaction. Therefore, it can be concluded that the rate-limiting step for dehydrogenation has changed from the diffusion controlled reaction for the ball-milled LiBH4 þ MgH2 mixture to the nucleation/growth-controlled reaction for the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4. Such a change can be attributed to the much smaller LiBH4 particles generated from the aerosol sprayed LiBH4/THF solution for the BMAS mixture than the LiBH4 obtained from hydrogenation of the bill-milled LiH þ MgB2 powders [38]. The substantially reduced particle sizes of the BMAS powder lead to a greatly decreased diffusion time. As a result, the nucleation and subsequent growth of LiH and MgB2 products at the MgH2/LiBH4 interface have become the slowest reaction step.\nWhat we should note here is that the perquisite of aforementioned kinetics analysis is assuming that all the involving particles are monodisperse, which is not possible for the real experimental system. Nevertheless, it is proposed [41] that for the dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation kinetics, the distribution of particle size has little influence if the reacted fraction, f , is smaller than 60%. Even when f is higher than 60%, the deviation from the behavior of monodisperse particles is still no more than 5% [41]. Therefore, the present conclusion obtained based on the assumption of monodisperse particles is valid for the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 because the largest fractions reacted in the first dehydrogenation is only 63%."

      "text" : "As established previously in Ref. [20], the unusually high reversible hydrogen storage for the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 is\naccomplished through two parallel reaction pathways. One is the MgH2eMg pathway, i.e., nano-MgH2 decomposes to form Mg and H2 first via reaction (2) and then Mg reacts with LiBH4 to form MgB2, LiH and H2 via reaction (3). The other is the LiBH4eLi2B12H12 pathway, i.e., nano-LiBH4 decomposes to form Li2B12H12 and H2 first via reaction (4) and then Li2B12H12 reacts with MgH2 to form MgB2, LiH and H2 via reaction (5). These reaction pathways become possible because of the presence of nano-MgH2 and nano-LiBH4 and their intimate mixing, enabled by the BMAS process [20]. For more detailed analysis and establishment of the two parallel reaction pathways, please refer to Ref. 20. However, it should be emphasized that both reaction pathways require reactions between two solid reactants. Specifically, reaction between LiBH4 and Mg, i.e. reaction (3), is required for the MgH2eMg pathway, whereas reaction between Li2B12H12 and MgH2, i.e. reaction (5), is a must for the LiBH4eLi2B12H12 pathway. Because of these solid state reactions (3) and (5), the areas of interfaces between solid reactants are critical for the overall reaction rates. The finer the particles and the more uniform mixing of the reactants, the larger interfacial areas between the reactants and thus the faster reaction kinetics.\nSince we have proven in Section 3.1 that the overall solid-state dehydriding reaction for the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 is nucleation/growth controlled, it is invaluable to consider the kinetics effects of the four possible elementary reactions, getting more insights into the kinetics nature of each elementary reaction. Such analysis is described below.\nDehydrogenation via the MgH2eMg Pathway: The analysis of the dehydriding curves of the ball-milled (640min) and handmixed MgH2 þ 5 vol% C mixtures with the aid of Eq. (10), is shown in Fig. 4. Clearly, whether with or without ball milling, the dehydrogenation ofMgH2þ 5 vol %mixture can be represented as a diffusion controlled reaction. By comparison, analyses of these two processes using the moving-interface controlled reaction model (Fig. S3), nucleation/growth controlled reaction model (Fig. S4) and gas-desorption controlled reaction model (Fig. S5) do not result in satisfactory results. The linear fitting equations obtained from the diffusion controlled reaction model, corresponding to the ballmilled and hand-milled mixtures respectively, are shown in Eqs. (19) and (20) below.\nð1 f 0,f Þ1=3 ¼1:012 0:0003 t1=2 with R2 ¼ 0:9918 (19)\nð1 f 0,f Þ1=3 ¼ 1:005 0:00007 t1=2 with R2 ¼ 0:9364 (20)\nSince the particle size reduction of MgH2 in the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 is also achieved through ball milling, it is reasonable to conclude that the rate-controlling step of reaction (2) for the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 is also the H2 diffusion through a Mg product layer (Fig. 5(a)). The driving force of the diffusion has been attributed to the density gradient of greater H2 concentration at the interfacial areas between MgH2 and Mg when compared with the H2 concentration at the Mg surface. Whether the Mg product layer generated during the decomposition of MgH2 is porous or not is analyzed through the theory of PillingeBedworth (PeB) ratio [42]. The PillingeBedworth ratio (RPB) for the common oxidizing reaction (21) is shown in Eq. (22). RPB has been employed to determine whether the metal can form protective oxides on the metal surface during oxidation since 1923 [42,43].\nx MðsÞ þ y =2 O2ðgÞ /MxOyðsÞ (21)\nRPB ¼ VMxOy VM ¼ MMxOy, rM x ,MM, rMxOy\n(22)\nwhere VMxOy and VM stand for the molar volumes of the oxide film and the metal reacted, respectively; MMxOy and MM are the molecular masses of the oxide and metal, respectively; and rMxOy and\nrM are the densities of the oxide and metal, respectively. It is generally agreed that when RPB is smaller than 1, a porous and adherent oxide film would be generated. When RPB is between 1 and 2, the oxide coating is passivating and provides a protecting effect against further surface oxidation. However, the oxide film would crack and chip off if RPB is larger than 2. Since VMgH2 and VMg are 18.15 cm3mol 1 and 13.98 cm3mol 1, respectively, RPB for reaction (2) is calculated to be 0.77, which suggested that the obtained Mg product layer here should be porous and also adherent. H2 is required to diffuse through this layer before its desorption from the Mg surface to ensure the continuous decomposition of MgH2.\nBased on the discussion above, reaction (2) can be described in three elementary steps, as expressed in Eqs. (23) e (25) below and schematically shown in Fig. 5(a).\nMgH2 / Mg þ H2 (23)"

(25) presents H2 desorbs from the active Mg surface site (see Fig. 5(a)).\nSince Section 3.1 has established that the overall dehydrogenation of the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 is nucleation-andgrowth controlled and the analysis of this section (Fig. 4) has proven that reaction (2) is diffusion controlled, it is then reasonable to deduce that reaction (3) is nucleation-and-growth controlled. This nucleation-and-growth controlled reaction can be described in three elementary steps as expressed by Eqs.

(28) describes desorption of H2 from the Mg/LiBH4 interface, leaving behind an active interface site. Based on these elementary steps, it can be concluded that large interfacial areas betweenMg and LiBH4 nanoparticles are needed for reaction (3) to occur. In addition, the rate-limiting step for this reaction is the nucleation and growth of LiH and MgB2 particles. Furthermore, this is also the slowest step for reactions (2) and (3), leading to the overall dehydrogenation of the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 exhibiting the nucleation-andgrowth controlled kinetics.\nDehydrogenation via the LiBH4eLi2B12H12 Pathway: A previous study [44] on the dehydrogenation properties from nanoscale LiBH4 obtained from the LiBH4/THF solution has shown that the slowest reaction step for reaction (4), i.e., the decomposition of nano-LiBH4 at 265 C, is H2 desorption on the surface. Since the nano-LiBH4 in the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 is also produced through aerosol spraying of the LiBH4/THF solution, it is reasonable to conclude that reaction (4) is gas-desorption controlled.\nConsidering the solid products of reaction (4), Li2B12H12 þ10 LiH, as a whole, the RPB value of reaction (4) could be calculated to be 0.63 because the molar volume of LiBH4 is 32.71 cm3mol 1 and the molar volume of (Li2B12H12 þ 10 LiH) is 248.26 cm3mol 1. Here the density value of Li2B12H12 is taken to be 1.029 g cm 3, calculated from ICSD using POWD-12 based on the proposed structure [45]. Thus, the (Li2B12H12 þ 10 LiH) product layer from reaction (4), if present on the surface of the LiBH4 core, would also be adherent and porous. Based on the discussion above, reaction (4) can be schematically shown in Fig. 6(a) and expressed by Eqs. (29)e(31) with the following three elementary steps.\n12 LiBH4 / ð Li2B12H12 þ 10 LiH Þ þ 13 H2 ▪ (29)"

(29) represents decomposition of LiBH4 to (Li2B12H12 þ 10 LiH) at the interface between LiBH4 and (Li2B12H12 þ 10 LiH), accompanying with the formation and absorption of H2 at an active interfacial site, ▪, whereas Eq.

(31) presents H2 desorbs from the active (Li2B12H12 þ 10 LiH) surface site (see Fig. 6(a)).\nSince the overall dehydrogenation of the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 is nucleation/growth controlled and the rate-limiting\nstep for reaction (4) is gas desorption, it can then be deduced that reaction (5), i.e., the reaction between MgH2 and Li2B12H12 to form MgB2, LiH and H2, is a nucleation/growth controlled reaction. Furthermore, the nucleation and growth of the reaction products is the slowest step if the dehydrogenation of the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 proceeds through the LiBH4eLi2B12H12 pathway. The elementary steps for reaction (5) can be described by Eqs. (32)e(34) and schematically shown in Fig. 6(b).\nLi2B12H12 þ MgH2 / Li2B12H12 >MgH2 (32)\nLi2B12H12 > 6 MgH2 / 2 LiH þ 6 MgB2 þ 11 H2 > (33)\n11 H2 > / 11 H2 þ 11> (34)\nhere, Eq.

(33) stands for Li2B12H12 reacting with MgH2 to form LiH and MgB2, accompanied by H2 absorption at the active Li2B12H12/MgH2 interface. Eq. (34) describes desorption of H2 from the Li2B12H12/MgH2 interface, leaving behind an active interface site.\nIt is interesting to note that the rate-limiting step for both the MgH2eMg and LiBH4eLi2B12H12 dehydrogenation pathways are associated with the nucleation and growth of the reaction products LiH and MgB2, enabled by large interfacial areas between the reactants LiBH4 and Mg for reaction (3) and Li2B12H12 and MgH2 for reaction (5). These results indicate that nucleation and growth of LiH and/or MgB2 are slow. Thus, in order to have fast nucleation and growth of LiH andMgB2, one needs to generate nano-LiBH4þ nanoMgH2 with the small particle sizes before cycles of dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation at 265 C. The ultrafine LiBH4 and MgH2 particles and their intimate mixing can offer large interfacial areas between reactants to form LiH and MgB2 through reactions (3) and (5). Finer particle sizes could be readily achieved by extending the ball milling time. To suppress particle growth during dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation cycles, the crystal growth inhibitor can be added during ball milling. Various additives, such as TiH2 [46], TiC [47], Mg~6Ni [48], Ni@rGO nanocomposite [49], Fe clusters@graphene [50] and TiB2@graphene nanosheets [51], are all proved to act as not only a grain refiner during ball milling but also a crystal growth inhibitor for Mg during cycling of hydrogen release and uptake. It is also worth noting that Ostwald ripening phenomenon that would bring about larger particle growth at the expense of smaller particles has been effectively suppressed for the LiNH2 þ LiH system after substantial high-energy ball milling [52]. This becomes possible because long-time ball milling results in uniform particle sizes. As a result, there is little or no driving force for a particular particle to grow at the expense of other particles. Therefore, extensive high-energy ball milling with the addition of crystal growth inhibitors should be the simplest and most effective method to improve the dehydrogenation kinetics and cycle stability. The effects of large interfacial areas and other powder characteristics on the dehydrogenation kinetics are further discussed below with the aid of various powder characterizations."

      "text" : "The investigation of powder characteristics before and after dehydrogenation and cycling can provide additional insights into the kinetics and mechanisms for the dehydrogenation of the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4. XRD patterns of the BMAS powder under various conditions are shown in Fig. S6. Based on Fig. S6, the crystallite size of MgH2 has been calculated using the Scherrer formula [53] and summarized in Table 5 through which the gradual\ngrowth of the crystallites of MgH2 particles has been noticed as the number of dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation cycles increase.\nThe crystallite sizes of LiBH4 cannot be identified from XRD due to its amorphous state. Thus, we have sprayed LiBH4/THF solution to a porous PTFE membrane and examined the morphology and size of the particles trapped by the PTFE membrane using SEM. The result indicates that aerosol sprayed LiBH4 particles are indeed in the range of 20e100 nm (see Fig. S7). Thus, when sprayed into a ball milling canister during the BMAS process, these LiBH4 nanoparticles are expected to be occluded into MgH2 nanoparticles because of repeated fracture and cold welding of MgH2 during ball milling, thereby creating a uniform mixture of MgH2 and LiBH4 at nanoscales. Given that the isothermal dehydrogenation temperature (265 C) is 96% of LiBH4's melting temperature (275 C) and the holding time is 20 h per dehydrogenation/re-hydrogenation cycle, both crystallite and particle growth of LiBH4 should be expected [54].\nThe evidence for particle growth can be obtained through SEM imaging and BET surface area measurements. The specific surface areas (SSA) of the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 at various conditions, determined using the BET method, are summarized in Table 5. Several interesting trends are noted from this set of data. First, the hand mixed MgH2 þ C mixture has the highest SSA because the SSA of the handmixedMgH2 þ 5 vol% C mixture before BMAS is dominated by the pre-milled graphite with a very large SSA (~630 m2/g) [55]. Second, due to the occlusion of graphite particles by MgH2 and LiBH4 during the BMAS process, the SSA of the BMAS mixture has reduced from 67.7 to 13.4m2 g 1. Third, the subsequent thermal exposure during dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation cycles has reduced the SSA further from 13.4 to approximately 0.7e1.4m2 g 1. Since the decrease in the SSA can only be caused by the following three phenomenon: (i) particle growth, (ii) agglomeration of multiple particles, or (iii) both [39], it can be concluded that particle growth and/or agglomeration of multiple particles have taken place during cycling. To further reinforce this conclusion, SEM examination was performed. By comparison of Fig. 7(a) and (b), the particle sizes of the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 have been decreased to ~100 nm, which is much smaller than that of the hand-mixed MgH2 þ 5 vol% C mixture (~1 mm). However, some of the particles have been discovered to be ~500 nm (Fig. 7(e)), after the sixth dehydrogenation. These evidences unambiguously indicate that gradual particle growth and agglomeration have taken place during dehydrogenation and hydrogenation cycles, consistent with the conclusion derived from the SSA analysis.\nAs discussed in Section 3.2, the dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation of the BMAS powder are through two parallel reaction pathways, i.e., theMgH2eMg pathwaywith reactions (2) and (3) and the LiBH4eLi2B12H12 pathway with reactions (4) and (5). MgH2 with nanosize is necessary for reactions (2) and (3), whereas, LiBH4 with nanosize is indispensable for reactions (4) and (5). The onset temperature would be higher than 265 C for reactions (2) and (4), if the particles sizes of MgH2 and LiBH4 reactant are larger than nano-scale [24,44]. In addition, large interfacial area is the prerequisite for reactions (3) and (5) to take place, which have also been proven to be the rate-limiting step, happening at 265 C [55,56]. Thus, the powder characterization results discussed above can provide the reasons why the H2 storage capacity of the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 gradually decreases as the number of cycles increases, as observed in Fig. 2. Since the growth of crystallite and particle sizes and the reduction in the interfacial area will lead to the gradual decay of dehydrogenation kinetics, future work should aim at preventing crystallite and particle growth as well as minimizing gradual loss of interfacial areas.\nTable 5 XRD-determined crystallite sizes of MgH2 and the measured specific surface areas of various mixtures indicated.\nSample ID Crystallite size of MgH2 (nm) Specific surface area (m2/g)\nHand mixed MgH2 þ C 64.88 67.741 BMAS 28.64 13.426 1R aN/D 1.358 1S 48.84 1.332 6R 65.70 0.725\na N/D stands for “not detectable”.

      "text" : "The present study provides detailed investigation of the dehydrogenation kinetics of a nano-LiBH4 þ nano-MgH2 mixture in a 0.5:1molar ratio (the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 mixture). The intimatemixing of nano-LiBH4 and nano-MgH2 is achieved through an automated BMAS process with high-energy ball milling time of 640min and 56 BMAS cycles. The major conclusions drawn from\nthis study are follows.\n1) BMAS is effective in producing nano-LiBH4 þ nano-MgH2 mixture with intimate mixing. As a result, the rate-limiting step has been altered from H2 diffusion for the ball-milled nanoLiBH4 þ nano-MgH2 mixture [38] to nucleation/growthcontrolled dehydrogenation for the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 mixture.\n2) The rate-limiting step for the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 mixture is identified to be the nucleation and growth of LiH and MgB2 at the interfacial area between nano-LiBH4 and nanoMgH2. 3) The kinetics performance of the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 mixture during isothermal cycling at 265 C degrades gradually. The nucleation rates increase with time for the first two dehydrogenation cycles. However, the vanishing nucleation is discovered in the subsequent cycles.\n4) The MgH2eMg reaction pathway proceeds in two major steps: (i) decomposition of MgH2 which is rate-limited by the diffusion of H2 through the porous Mg product layer outside the MgH2 shrinking core and (ii) reaction between Mg and LiBH4 the rate of which is controlled by the nucleation and growth of LiH and MgB2 at the Mg/LiBH4 interface. 5) The LiBH4eLi2B12H12 reaction pathway proceeds in two major steps: (i) decomposition of nano-LiBH4 the rate of which is controlled by H2 gas desorption on the surface of the (Li2B12H12 þ 10LiH) product layer outside the LiBH4 shrinking core and (ii) reaction between Li2B12H12 and MgH2 which is rate-limited by the nucleation and growth of LiH and MgB2 at the Li2B12H12/MgH2 interface. 6) The degradation of the kinetics performance and gradual decay in the reversible hydrogen storage capacity of the BMAS powder with 25% LiBH4 can be associated with gradual increases in the crystallite and particle sizes and a decrease in the interfacial area during hydrogenation and dehydrogenation cycles."

    "abstractText" : "The dehydrogenation reaction pathway and rate-limiting step of a nano-LiBH4 þ nano-MgH2 mixture with a 0.5:1molar ratio, which has been shown to have the ability to reversibly release and absorb ~5.7 wt% H2 at 265 C, have been investigated in detail. The study reveals that the solid-state dehydrogenation kinetics of the MgH2 þ 0.5 LiBH4 mixture at 265 C is nucleation-and-growth controlled. The rate-limiting step for dehydrogenation via the two parallel reaction pathways has been identified through examination of the elementary reactions as the nucleation and growth of reaction products LiH and MgB2. The interfacial area between MgH2 and LiBH4 plays a critical role in the nucleation and growth of LiH and MgB2, and thus influence the dehydrogenation kinetics and H2 storage capacity of the MgH2 þ 0.5 LiBH4 mixture. X-ray diffraction, SEM analysis and specific surface area measurements reveal that the evolution of the powder characteristics before and after isothermal hydrogen uptake/release cycles is consistent with the kinetics observation and analysis. This study indicates that to further improve the dehydrogenation kinetics of the MgH2 þ LiBH4 mixture, the nucleation and growth rates of LiH and/or MgB2 should be enhanced in the future, while the interfacial area between MgH2 and LiBH4 should be increased and maintained to be as large as possible during hydrogen uptake/release cycles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
