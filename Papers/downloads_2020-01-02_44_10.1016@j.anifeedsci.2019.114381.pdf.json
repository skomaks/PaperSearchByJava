A total of 120 weanling pigs with an average weight of 6.87±0.4 kg were assigned to 4 diets with 10 pigs per cage and 3 replicates per treatment. The experimental diets were fed for 28 days in 2 phases (phase 1, d 0–14; and phase 2, d 15–28). Treatments were: Control (without Se supplementation), sodium selenite (INO; 0.30 ppm), hot melt extruded sodium selenite (HME; 0.30 ppm), and selenomethionine (ORG; 0.3 ppm). There were significant responses (P<0.05) for higher serum Se concentration in the HME and ORG treatments in phase 1 and 2. The serum GPx analyses revealed that supplemental HME and ORG significantly increased the concentration of GPx in the serum in phase 1 and phase 2. There was an up-regulated (P<0.01) expression of Selenoprotein W, GPx1, GPx3, GPx4, and GPx5 in the livers of the HME and ORG pigs. In conclusion, the HME and ORG Se showed increased antioxidant status, consequently being a more suitable source of Se than regular sodium selenite."

      "text" : "Selenium (Se) is one of the essential trace minerals involved in various biological activities of animals. Selenium deficiency impairs the activity of several antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (Diplock, 1992; Dalgaard et al., 2018). Selenium is widely supplemented in diets for swine because the majority of common feed ingredients are marginally deficient in Se (Surai and Fisinin, 2016). The dietary Se supplement has been mainly based on the inorganic source in the form of sodium selenite due to relatively low cost. Although the NRC (2012) recommends 30 mg/kg of dietary Se for weanling pigs, the supplementation of Se at levels above the requirement, particularly during the stressful periods, is a common practice to reduce the possibility of Se deficiency and optimizing the growth performance under commercial conditions (Gan et al., 2014). Weaning is the most critical stage of pig production when the deficiency of Se is likely to occur due to enteric infections (Surai and Fisinin, 2016; Kim et al., 2017; Dalgaard et al., 2018). However, in recent years, the high dietary supplementation of minerals has been a subject of considerable environmental contamination concern due to excess mineral excretion. Therefore, the search is being increased to find alternative\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2019.114381 Received 31 May 2019; Received in revised form 9 November 2019; Accepted 17 December 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

Nano-size particles were found to have higher bioavailability owing to higher activity and specific surface area (Boostani et al., 2015). However, the efficacy of nanoparticles and the rate of bioavailability may be related to the kind of nano process. The affinity of inorganic minerals to solvents such as water is low; therefore, thermodynamic process is essential to maximize the dispersion of minerals in solvents. The dispersion stability of nano-sized particles in the final product may affect the bioavailability of minerals. The hot melt extrusion (HME) is known to be one of the best environmentally friendly techniques that has been developed for nanoparticle trace elements production in the pharmaceutical industry (Lee et al., 2017). Furthermore, the uniformity of Se dispersion during the HME process is attributed to the source of the incorporated polymer matrix. The solubility and dispersion of poorly watersoluble items increase by applying copolymers as the binder of dry or wet granulation (Lee et al., 2017). In the HME process, the raw materials homogeneously mix into the extruder through a rotating screw towards the die in a high temperature. The barrels temperature mainly designs to be above the glass transition temperature of polymeric substances, to be able to disperse the materials molecularly in the polymer matrix. This technique has to our knowledge not been exploited as yet in the swine feed industry. We hypothesized that Se nanoparticles prepared by the HME process can improve the absorption of Se in weanling pigs and thus be more efficient in comparison to traditional inorganic Se. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of nano and organic Se on antioxidant status, organ gene expression, growth performance, and nutrient digestibility, on weanling pigs."

Ltd., Pyeongtaek, Korea) connected with a round-shaped die (1 mm diameter) was used for the preparation of extruded materials (Lee et al., 2017). The temperatures of barrel and die section were maintained 45 °C and 40 °C, respectively. The speed of the screw was 150 rpm during HME process. By passing through conveying and kneading sections in the barrel, samples were extruded from the die section. Extruded substances were solidified and they were milled by the HBL-3500S grinder (Samyang Electronics Co., Gunpo, Korea). The particle properties of Na2SeO3 nano-particles dispersed in distilled water (DW) were elucidated. The hydrodynamic size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential of Na2SeO3 nano-particles were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and laser Doppler methods (ELS-Z1000; Otsuka Electronics, Tokyo, Japan). Powder of Na2SeO3 extrudate was dispersed in DW at 20 mg/mL and their particle properties were tested. The particle shape of Na2SeO3 extrudate was observed by transmission electron microscopy TEM. The dispersion of Na2SeO3 nano-particles was loaded onto the copper grid with film and dried for 10 min. That sample was then observed by TEM (JEM 1010; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The morphological shape of Na2SeO3 was measured by transmission electron microscopy (JEM 1010; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The final product was a white powder and the particle sizes were ranged from 28 to 59 nm."

      "heading" : "4. Discussion",
      "text" : "One of the main aims of the present study was to evaluate the bioavailability of different Se sources in weanling pigs. The increase in the supplemented doses of Se was reflected in Se concentration of serum (Jang et al., 2010; Dalgaard et al., 2018) or liver (Jang et al., 2010; Falk et al., 2018). Se is absorbed from the intestine and subsequently transported to the bloodstream, as serum Se was higher in HME or ORG pigs. Selenomethionine as an organic Se absorbs via methionine transporters and convert to selenide in the liver to provide Se for selenoprotein synthesis (Juniper et al., 2009; Falk et al., 2018). The previous literature confirmed the use of organic sources such as selenomethionine is superior to inorganic sources (Kim and Mahan, 2001; Jang et al., 2010; Dalgaard et al., 2018). In contrast, considering the mentioned aspects, the result of this study does not confirm the superior role of ORG and not only no difference was observed between inorganic Se-HME and ORG in serum Se concentration, but also a lower concentration of Se in\nFig. 2. (A) Fold change in mRNA level of the selenoprotein W (SELW), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPx2), glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), and glutathione peroxidase 5 (GPx5) genes of the livers in treated pigs with dietary inorganic selenium (INO), nano-selenium (HME), and organic selenium (ORG) supplements compared to the control pigs. (B) Fold change in mRNA level of the SELW, GPx1, GPx2, GPx3), GPx4, and GPx5 genes of the spleens in treated pigs with dietary selenium supplements compared to the control pigs. Data were normalized to the β-actin gene. Each value represents the mean of twelve pigs± SD. Different letters show significant difference between the treatments (P<0.05).\nthe liver was observed in the ORG pigs compared with HME pigs. Therefore, our study can reject the hypothesis that the bioavailability of Se increases in the organic form due to the use a different absorption pathway. Instead, the particle size can be considered as a more important factor. The types of nano process and the applied polymer may effectively define the absorption efficiency of particles due to a high variation in the reported results in the literature (Zhan et al., 2007; Surai and Fisinin, 2016; Skalickova et al., 2017). The chemical (Shi et al., 2011), biological (Hu et al., 2012; Forootanfar et al., 2014), and physical (Quintana et al., 2002) techniques have already been applied to produce nano-particle Se. Each technique may own its mode of action and in our study the chemical polymers effectively increased the absorption of Se. These results are in agreement with previous findings in absorption efficiency of nano-particles (Lee et al., 2017). Nano-size particles have been indicated to increase the efficiency of absorption owing to small particle size and high surface area. Interestingly, no difference was found in serum Se between the control and INO pigs in spite of their substantial variation in Se intake. It is well known that the liver markedly regulates the blood metabolites, and the serum Se concentration for INO treatment may be regulated faster than HME due to lower concentration.\nSelenium status is commonly evaluated by several indicators. Even though serum concentrations of Se will reflect the short term changes, it still is widely applied in the references to be an indicator of Se status (Baltić et al., 2015; Dalto et al., 2018). In addition to serum Se, the activity of Se-GPx is considered as a frequently used factor of long-term immune and antioxidant status (Chen et al., 2016; Dalgaard et al., 2018). We studied the effect of different Se sources on antioxidant status of weanling pigs and found that the serum GPx of HME and ORG pigs was higher than that of serum GPx from the control pigs. The Se availability directly affects the activity of GPx (Dalto et al., 2018), however, there is a complex relationship between the activity of Se-GPx and dietary Se, particularly when the amount of serum Se is the maximum for adequate Se-GPx production. The increase in serum GPx in HME and ORG pigs are similar to the previous findings on GPx concentration in serum of pigs, in which the GPx expression increased in organs from either the inorganic Se (Zhan et al., 2007; Falk et al., 2018) or organic Se (Jang et al., 2010; Falk et al., 2018). Selenium is responsible for the diverse antioxidant functions and biological pathways by regulating the Se-depended antioxidant enzymes and whole body glutathione synthesis (Diplock, 1992; Dalgaard et al., 2018). The significant differences in serum GPx between pigs fed the control and Se-supplemented diets are an expected result due to the strongly related connection between the activity of GPx and Se, but the higher GPx in HME pigs compared with INO pigs may be related to the smaller particle size of Se and the increased absorption.\nGPx family is a reliable biomarker of low Se status in animals (Surai and Fisinin, 2014). GPxs are well known for the antioxidant function by removing potentially damaging radicals (Pisoschi and Pop, 2015; Surai and Fisinin, 2016). The gene expression of GPx in the livers and spleens was increased in weanling pigs fed dietary Se. The comparison between the sources of Se showed relatively a higher livers GPX-1, GPx-3, and SelW expression in HME pigs, but a higher GPx-5 expression for ORG. Further, among eight GPxs in mammals, GPx1 is the most prevalent selenoprotein in animals, working as a strong antioxidant factor to control the toxic effects of H2O2 and decrease oxidative damage of cells (Lubos et al., 2011; Dalgaard et al., 2018). Given that GPx1 account for the highest share of the body selenoproteins (Reeves and Hoffmann, 2009), the highest expression of GPx1 in the livers of HME pigs may be an important factor to show the higher bioavailability of Se. In addition, the GPx expression in INO pigs is much lower than our expectation compared with HME and ORG pigs. As we mentioned before, the synthesis of selenoproteins is regulated by the presence of Se, and the reduced bioavailability of Se limits anti-oxidative activity response. The production of selenoproteins can be triggered by hydrogen selenide as a substrate derived from sodium selenite by thiols reductions (Skalickova et al., 2017). The GPx’s are collectively the primary factor for signaling and detoxification of free radicals such as H2O2 with an integral role to maintain endogenous cellular redox homeostasis (Reeves and Hoffmann, 2009; Pisoschi and Pop, 2015; Skalickova et al., 2017). It has been reported that the form of Se as inorganic or organic is associated with the magnitude of GPx activity (Boostani et al., 2015; Falk et al., 2018). Our findings on the increased GPx activity can be supported by the research of Gan et al. (2014) who indicated a higher GPx activity in the livers of pigs fed high levels of Se. It is well documented that the antioxidant status is proportional to the body Se pool.\nADG, average daily gain; ADFI, average daily feed intake; FCR, feed conversion ratio, INO, sodium selenite; HME, hot melt extruded sodium selenite; ORG, selenomethionine. a∼bMeans values with different superscripts with same row differ (P < 0.05).\n1 Standard error of means.\nThe nutrient requirements of swine (NRC, 2012) recommend 0.3 ppm Se for weanling pigs. Recommendations for dietary Se, are mostly according to the maximum serum GPx activity. Till date, little work has been done on the relationship between Se level of diet and the saturation of serum GPx and the possible effects of serum antioxidant capacity on the growth performance of pigs.\nIt was noted that supplementation of Se is required for optimal growth (Pinto et al., 2012). In the present study, the Se-supplemented diets at 0.3 g/kg did not modify the overall ADG, FCR or ADFI of pigs compared to the control group. However, the ADG of HME and ORG pigs were improved in phase 1, indicating that the Se requirement of pigs during the stressful weaning period may be higher than the standard recommended requirements at a younger age than older age. Dietary Se mitigated the effects of stressors such as aflatoxin (Hao et al., 2016) and heat stress (Liu et al., 2016) on barrier integrity of the intestine and mRNA expression of GPx1, associated with a decrease in oxidative stress in pigs. The higher ADFI or improved immune status may explain the higher ADG in the first phase. Comparing the effect of the three different Se sources along the first phase of the experimental period (1–14 days) shows that the HME and ORG Se sources were more effective than the INO at 0.3 ppm/kg of diet. Organic minerals use a different absorption pathway, and HME may increase the intestinal absorption due to the role of smaller particle size. Particle size is a determinant parameter to increase the absorption efficiency (Shi et al., 2011). The smaller size of nanoparticles (around 200 nm) allows Se to be absorbed through the intestinal mucus barrier (Kachuee et al., 2019). Interestingly, no association was found between the FCR and digestibility of nutrients in the first phase in spite of the significant contribution of Se to increased ADG. A limitation of our study is the use of only a single Se dose because this was a comparative experiment based on different Se sources, and we cannot recommend the best dose of Se for weanling pigs in different phases. Moreover, an accepted optimal dose has not been recommended for nano-Se and appropriate dietary level for Se is still under debate. The price difference of nanoparticle or organic sources compared to the common inorganic source has restricted their use in the diets. However, apart from the economic cost, critical problems with regard to the environmental issues should take into consideration in diet production. Therefore, it is necessary for the swine industry to apply highly absorbable Se to reduce environmental pollution.\nIn conclusion, the weanling pigs fed the HME or ORG diets exhibited an increased glutathione peroxidase in immune organs, indicating a higher oxidant capacity compared with the INO and control. According to the result of Se concentration in the liver, it can be stated that the nano-Se is absorbed and preserved more effectively than the organic source. According to the growth performance results, higher doses of Se are recommended during the first two weeks of the weaning period.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests."

A total of 120 weanling pigs with an average weight of 6.87±0.4 kg were assigned to 4 diets with 10 pigs per cage and 3 replicates per treatment. The experimental diets were fed for 28 days in 2 phases (phase 1, d 0–14; and phase 2, d 15–28). Treatments were: Control (without Se supplementation), sodium selenite (INO; 0.30 ppm), hot melt extruded sodium selenite (HME; 0.30 ppm), and selenomethionine (ORG; 0.3 ppm). There were significant responses (P<0.05) for higher serum Se concentration in the HME and ORG treatments in phase 1 and 2. The serum GPx analyses revealed that supplemental HME and ORG significantly increased the concentration of GPx in the serum in phase 1 and phase 2. There was an up-regulated (P<0.01) expression of Selenoprotein W, GPx1, GPx3, GPx4, and GPx5 in the livers of the HME and ORG pigs. In conclusion, the HME and ORG Se showed increased antioxidant status, consequently being a more suitable source of Se than regular sodium selenite.",
