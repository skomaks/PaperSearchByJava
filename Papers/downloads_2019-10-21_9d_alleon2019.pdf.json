Sedimentary graphite, irrespective of its isotopic composition, does not constitute a reliable biosignature because the rocks in which it is found are generally metamorphosed to the point where convincing signs of life have been erased. Rather, multiple lines of evidence, including sedimentary textures, microfossils, large accumulations of organic matter and isotopic data for co-existing carbon, nitrogen and sulfur are required before biological origin can be convincingly demonstrated."

      "text" : "Multiple geological and inorganic geochemical lines of evidence signal the permanent accumulation of dioxygen in Earth's surface environments between ∼2.4 and ∼2.3 Ga, providing a minimum age for the development of oxygenic photosynthesis (for details, see reviews by Refs. [1,2]). Opinions differ significantly on how to interpret this critical event. On one hand, aspects of comparative biology, modern biochemistry, and genomic and metagenomic data suggest that oxygenic photosynthesis, as it exists in contemporary taxa, is a relatively late (Paleoproterozoic) metabolic invention from the perspective of Earth history (see review by Ref. [3]). In contrast, most recent molecular clock analyses [4,5] are suggesting the presence of oxygenic photosynthesis as far back as Mesoarchean times. Advances in phylogenomics, recognition of pivotal horizontal gene transfer events, and molecular clocks calibrated to well established geochemical and paleontological transitions, offer a potential transformative understanding of the earliest biogeochemical cycles [5,6].\nIn parallel, carbonaceous matter from Archean sedimentary rocks should record the key information needed to understanding the timing of the emergence and the evolution of life, including biological innovations such as oxygenic photosynthesis [7]. Documenting the Archean biosignature record remains highly challenging. Multiple exogenous and endogenous processes could have sourced abiotic organic matter on the early Earth including, for example, delivery on comets and asteroids (e.g. Ref. [8]), photochemical reactions in the atmosphere (e.g. Ref. [9]), and organic synthesis in hydrothermal systems (e.g., Ref. [10]). Because all known Archean rocks are significantly altered by metamorphic overprinting, it is sometimes very difficult to distinguish biogenic objects from abiotic ones, and if biogenic, to attribute their morphological and/or geochemical characteristics to a particular organism or metabolism. Recent reviews of the early life fossil record\nhave been provided by Bernard and Papineau [11]; Summons and Hallman [12] and Knoll et al. [13]. Rather than giving a complete review of the Archean biosignature record, the present contribution aims to illustrate, from examples selected in the literature, the problems that need to be resolved in order to reliably document the early life biosignature record, and the analytical strategies that have been implemented for this purpose."

      "heading" : "2. Eoarchean rocks: can graphite afford reliable evidence for paleobiological activity?",
      "text" : "Eoarchean rocks exposed within intensely metamorphosed geological formations from Canada (Nuvvuagittuq supracrustal belt, Saglek Block) and southern Greenland (Isua supracrustal belt and Akilia island), may have recorded early life activity. Claims for ∼3.8 Ga life with possible photoautotrophic metabolism have been made on the basis of the δ13C values of organic carbon present in rocks from Isua (e.g., Refs. [14,15]). The isotopic data in question, which are within the range expected for biological fractionation, were obtained from analyses of bulk carbonaceous matter extracted from rock samples by demineralization with acids. Yet, in situ spatially resolved investigations using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in rock samples from Isua, have shown the presence of organic matter produced by recent endolithic microorganisms [16]. Therefore, the antiquity of all the organic carbon cannot be demonstrated for such old and altered rocks from the bulk analyses alone. Spatially-resolved tools such as scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM, respectively), Raman microspectroscopy, scanning transmission X-ray microscopy coupled with X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (STXM-based XANES spectroscopy), and ion micro- and nano-probe secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS and NanoSIMS, respectively), have thus been extensively applied to address this problem.

Mojzsis et al. [23] have reported in situ ion-microprobe measurements of 13C-depleted graphite (δ13C values ranging from −49 to −21‰) associated with apatite grains in a quartz–pyroxene rock sample from Akilia island. This 13C-depleted graphite has led these authors to interpret the graphite-apatite association as the earliest remains of life on Earth. There also, these conclusions about the existence of Eoarchean life have since been challenged.\nFor instance, Papineau et al. [24,25] have used SEM, TEM, as well as Raman spectroscopy and STXM-based XANES spectroscopy, to characterize the graphite-apatite associations in rock samples from the same locality. In contrast with previous claims, these authors did not report any graphite occurring as inclusion in apatite crystals. Rather, graphite was shown to systematically occur as coatings on apatite\nGlossary\nArchean Eon The geologic eon that extends from ca. 4.0 Ga to the Proterozoic 2.5 Ga. The Archean Eon is in the process of being redefined chronometrically and subdivided into the eras of Eoarchean (4.0–3.6 Ga), Paleoarchean (3.6–3.2 Ga), Mesoarchean (3.2–2.8 Ga), and Neoarchean (2.8–2.5 Ga). The International Commission on Stratigraphy currently does not recognize the lower boundary of the Eoarchean Biogenic Produced by once living organisms Biosignature A distinctive pattern, product, or characteristic by which life can be identified Bitumen Organic matter that is or was mobile and soluble in organic solvents Chert Rock almost exclusively made of silica Kerogen Macromolecular organic matter insoluble in organic solvents Ma/Ga Million/billion years before present Syngenetic Formed at the same time.\ngrains, suggesting a secondary origin. Poorly crystalline graphite has been reported to also occur as coatings on apatite crystals in Eoarchean rocks from the Nuvvuagittuq supracrustal belt, with a disordered structure inconsistent with amphibolite facies metamorphism, implying that graphite formed after peak metamorphism [26]. Quartz-pyroxene rock samples from Akilia island have been reported to contain graphite within CO2-CH4-H2O-bearing fluid inclusions [27]. Graphite can indeed precipitate directly from CH4- or CO2-bearing fluids associated with metamorphic conditions typical of the upper amphibolite facies (e.g. Refs. [28,29]), or at temperatures and pressures as low as 400–500 °C and 1–2 kbar, respectively [30]. Recent experimental work and thermodynamic calculations have shown that solid carbonaceous matter can also precipitate from the reduction of CO2 by H2 in hydrothermal fluids at even lower temperature (200–300 °C; [31,32]).\nRecently, additional evidence for Eoarchean life has been claimed based on the presence of 13C-depleted graphite particles within metasedimentary rocks from Isua [33] and from the Saglek block in northern Labrador, Canada [34]. Similarly, however, evidence for the antiquity of graphite is lacking. The geological history of these rocks is complex and poorly resolved. All known sequences from these locations have experienced at least two metamorphic events since their formation, the most recent reaching at least the upper amphibolite facies around 2.8–2.5 Ga [17–22]. Graphite could thus have precipitated from hydrothermal and metasomatic fluids at any time during post-Eoarchean metamorphic episodes and, at least partially, could be as young as 2.8–2.5 Ga. Alternatively, thermal decomposition of siderite (iron carbonate FeCO3) at 500–600 °C was proposed as an abiotic mechanism for the formation of graphite found in metamorphosed rocks from Isua [35,36]. Adding further complexity, the sedimentary nature of the protolith (i.e. the original, unmetamorphosed precursor) of these Eoarchean metamorphic rocks has been questioned, casting doubt about the significance of the presence of carbonaceous matter, even if originally present in the protolith [19,20,37].\nLast, but not least, even assuming that the reported carbonaceous particles originate from the degradation of ≥3.8 Ga organic molecules trapped in sediments, carbon isotopic compositions, alone, cannot be used to distinguish between abiotic and biogenic sources. 13C-depleted signatures are indeed not unique to the chemistry of life (e.g. Refs. [38,39]), as demonstrated, for instance, by the experimental synthesis of similarly 13C-depleted abiotic hydrocarbons under hydrothermal conditions [40,41]. Consequently, even for better constrained geological settings, the interpretation of the origin of carbon based on its isotopic composition is often controversial. For instance, 13C-depleted signatures of methane found in fluid inclusions from hydrothermal cherts of the 3.5 Ga Dresser Formation were interpreted to be biogenic by some authors [42], while abiotic alternatives were considered to be equally plausible by others [43]. Additional information is therefore required in order to verify and augment the early life biosignature record.\nApart from the problem of dating carbonaceous matter in Eoarchean metamorphic rocks, these examples thus emphasize the low paleobiological potential of graphite present in the oldest rocks on the Earth. Any organic matter present during the formation of Eoarchean rocks has, by now, been converted into crystalline graphite with the inevitable loss of all chemical elements other than carbon. This precludes any complementary isotopic or diagnostic molecular data being acquired (Fig. 1)."

      "text" : "Despite the oldest known terrestrial rocks having Eoarchean ages, older zircon crystals have been preserved in younger sequences. Possibly the best-studied examples are the 3.0 Ga metamorphic rocks from Jack Hills, Western Australia [47]. Recently, and despite the many crystals analyzed, a single 4.1 Ga zircon from Jack Hills was reported to contain 13C-depleted carbonaceous micrograins, interpreted to be\nderived from biological process that occurred more than 4.1 billion years ago [48]. Yet, this carbonaceous matter is likely derived from secondary processes, possibly during subsequent metamorphism as proposed for other inclusions [49], or during polishing as it was the case for putative Hadean diamonds in zircons from Jack Hills [50]. Indeed, even assuming structural disorder induced by polishing artefacts [51], the reported Raman spectral characteristics of this carbonaceous matter, interpreted by the authors to be “disordered graphite”, indicate that it did not experienced peak temperatures above 300 °C [45], which is inconsistent with the crystallization history of the zircon, inferred from titanium concentrations to have occurred at temperatures above 600 °C [48]."

      "text" : "The Pilbara Craton in Western Australia (e.g. Ref. [52]), and the Kaapvaal Craton in South Africa (e.g. Ref. [53]), host some of the best preserved Paleoarchean sedimentary rocks. Primary features in these rocks have been less altered than those of Eoarchean age due to their lower grade metamorphic history. Therefore, organic matter has not been converted into graphite, thereby potentially preserving more geochemical information concerning the nature of biological precursors (Fig. 1)."

      "heading" : "4.1. Organic matter from Paleoarchean cherts: does it record paleobiological activity?",
      "text" : "The solvent-soluble fraction of organic matter (i.e. bitumen) from Archean rocks is dominated by information-poor aromatic and diamondoid hydrocarbons and is easily confounded by contaminants [54]. In contrast, the solvent-insoluble fraction (i.e. kerogen) is considered to be derived from syngenetic organic precursors [55,56]. In one study of a kerogen isolated from a black chert vein in the 3.5 Ga Dresser Formation, Pilbara Craton, catalytic pyrolysis in a stream of high-pressure hydrogen gas yielded abundant hydrocarbons with aliphatic chains up to 18 carbons in length with an abrupt step to only trace levels of longer chains [57]. In another study of a similarly aged kerogen from a different locality in the Pilbara Craton, Curie-point pyrolysis afforded alkene-alkane doublets with up to 25 carbon atoms and an odd over even carbon number preference [58]. In both cases, these distributions were claimed to be evidence for Paleoarchean biological activity because of molecular characteristics similar to unambiguous biogenic organic matter. Yet, the presence of such fragile, long-chain, aliphatic molecules in rocks having been exposed to low-grade metamorphism has raised questions about their actual origins [56]. In addition, an alternative scenario involving abiotic hydrothermal synthesis of organic compounds has been proposed for the generation of carbonaceous matter in these Paleoarchean black chert dykes and stratiform units [59]. Lastly, it should be noted that the elemental and isotopic compositions measured on kerogens isolated from Paleoarchean rocks, namely the organic carbon content, the H/C ratio values, and the δ13C values, can be impacted by late contamination, either during geological secondary processes, or through the chemical isolation and concentration of kerogen in the laboratory [60,61]. Thus, further work is needed to elevate these putative biosignatures beyond all doubt."

      "heading" : "4.2. Macroscopic signatures of early life: stromatolites and associated organic matter",
      "text" : "In both the Pilbara and Kaapvaal Cratons, 3.5–3.2 Ga sedimentary rocks having sedimentary fabrics morphologically similar to those associated with microbial activity in modern microbialites (i.e. stromatolites; microbially influenced sedimentary structures or MISS) have been widely interpreted as biosedimentary structures (e.g., Refs. [62–65]). Yet, their biogenicity has sometimes been questioned and\nalternative mechanisms for an abiotic origin have been proposed [66,67]. Reassessment of the possible formation mechanisms of the Pilbara stromatolites has largely focused on the Strelley Pool Formation (SPF, Pilbara Craton). There, trace element compositions of carbonates and cherts indicate that they have been formed in shallow marine environments [68,69], and the SPF stromatolites display distinct morphotypes with macro- and micro-textural features more easily explainable with the contribution of microbial activity, rather than by purely abiotic physicochemical processes [70,71]. In addition to these inorganic geochemical and morphological lines of evidence, organic matter has been documented in the laminations of the Strelley Pool stromatolites [71–74]. Carbon isotopic compositions of this organic matter measured using SIMS cover a large range of negative δ13C values, interpreted as the result of multiple autotrophic pathways for carbon fixation [74]. A similar line of reasoning applies to isotopic data acquired with SIMS on organic matter present in microstructures preserved in bedded cherts and hydrothermal chert veins of the Dresser Formation. Although present mainly as disseminated clots and in fine laminae, the δ13C values in specific microstructural types range between −33.6‰ and −25.7‰. Because the features are considered to represent primary textures formed prior to host rock lithification, and that no evidence was found for subsequent hydrocarbon migration beyond the micrometer scale, the carbonaceous structures were interpreted to represent the remains of microbes that employed different Cfixation pathways [75].\nNanoSIMS analyses of sulfur isotopic compositions of organic matter preserved in the SPF stromatolites have revealed negative δ34S values interpreted to be the result of sulfur disproportionation by microorganisms using organics, H2, or CH4 as electron donors to form H2S [72]. Organic matter present in black stromatolitic cherts has also been reported to be closely associated with framboidal pyrite crystals, interpreted as the relict of microbial processes, possibly microbial sulfate reduction, even though the bulk sulfur isotopic composition of pyrite does not provide information about a specific metabolism [73]."

      "heading" : "4.3. Microscopic signatures of early life: carbonaceous microstructures",
      "text" : "Microfossils have not been reported in Paleoarchean stromatolites where one, logically, would expect to find them. Nevertheless, morphologically diverse carbonaceous microstructures, reported in Paleoarchean cherts from both the Pilbara and the Kaapvaal Cratons, were originally interpreted as fossilized filamentous and coccoidal microorganisms (e.g., Refs. [76–78]). Thereafter, both the age and biogenicity of these objects have yet been questioned (e.g., Ref. [79]). The challenging nature of micropaleontological studies in Paleoarchean rocks is well illustrated by the long-standing controversy about the origin of microstructures described in black chert samples from the 3.5 Ga Apex Basalt Formation (Pilbara Craton, Western Australia). There, Schopf and Packer [78] reported the occurrence of spherical and filamentous microstructures. Based on morphological comparison with younger fossil and extant microbial species, the authors interpreted them as fossilized coccoidal cells and trichomes of prokaryotic, possibly oxygen-producing, microorganisms. Schopf [80] subsequently described the morphological diversity of the Apex filamentous objects in more detail where they were interpreted as trichomic cyanobacteriumlike fossilized microorganisms, additionally suggesting that oxygenic photosynthesis may have evolved as early as 3.5 Ga. Schopf et al. [81] applied Raman microspectroscopy to further document in situ the chemistry of the optically discernible microstructures, showing that they are composed of carbonaceous matter that the authors have interpreted to be kerogen, thereby providing further evidence for their biogenicity. As numerous authors have pointed out, however, the use of Raman spectroscopy to assign an origin to any given carbonaceous material is questionable because the technique probes the degree of structural organization of carbon but does not allow measurements that provide constraints concerning biogenicity. The elemental and\nmolecular compositional characteristics that typify the chemistry of complex carbonaceous materials such as kerogens and other carbonaceous materials can display similar Raman spectra, independent of their biogenic or abiotic origin [82]. Of note, as the Raman spectra of carbonaceous matter evolve systematically with metamorphic grade [83], it is possible to quantitatively estimate the peak temperature experienced by carbonaceous matter during metamorphism [84,85]. Raman spectroscopy has also been used to evaluate the degree of chemical preservation of kerogens [86,87], although Raman spectral characteristics and elemental/molecular compositions of organic matter can sometimes be unrelated in such complex disordered organic materials [82,85,88,89].\nThus, both the geological context of the carbonaceous microstructure-bearing cherts in the Apex Basalt Formation and the biogenicity of the microstructures have been questioned. Previously interpreted as a bedded sedimentary deposit containing detrital clasts [80], the Apex chert has been reinterpreted as a hydrothermal brecciated vein resulting from the circulation of hot fluids (≅300 °C), therefore representing an environment that was adverse for the presence of cyanobacterial activity but favorable for hyperthermophile bacteria or abiotic synthesis of hydrocarbons [90]. In addition, from petrographic investigations on the same thin section studied by Schopf et al. [81]; as well as on additional samples re-collected from the same locality, Brasier et al. [90] have reported more diverse and complex morphologies, with filamentous microstructures displaying multiple and chaotic branching. This has led these authors to reinterpret the microfossil-like objects as secondary artefacts formed during the circulation of hydrothermal fluids (see also [91]).\nIn parallel, Garcia-Ruiz et al. [92] have experimentally demonstrated that morphologically complex filamentous microstructures, with shapes and sizes similar to those from the Apex chert, can be synthesized by mixing a water-soluble barium salt with alkaline sodium silicate solutions at ambient temperature and pressure. When placed under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of simple organic molecules (formaldehyde-phenol mixtures), the inorganic filaments served as templates for the adsorption and condensation of carbonaceous matter. After having been heated at 500 °C for 5 h, the Raman spectral characteristics of the experimental carbonaceous products are reported to be broadly similar to those of the Apex filaments [92]. Several other studies have also reported non-carbonaceous mineral [93,94] and carbon-containing clay mineral [95,96] filamentous microstructures from the Apex cherts, which have also been interpreted as abiotic artefacts produced during hydrothermalism. Schopf and Kudryavtsev [97] and Schopf et al. [98] still question the significance of these findings and the debate continues because these newly described objects are not from the originally documented Apex specimens. Schopf et al. [98] have reported carbon isotopic values collected in situ on the Apex carbonaceous microstructures using SIMS. The measured 13C-depleted values are proposed by these authors to be morphotype-specific, thus reflecting taxon-specific values. Yet, the carbon isotopic compositions of the different microstructures are not significantly different from one another once one takes into account the variability in the measurements with respect to the associated analytical uncertainties.\nWhile the carbonaceous nature and the morphological characteristics of many Archean microstructures are not sufficiently informative to unambiguously assess their origins, the isotopic compositions of carbonaceous matter, when associated with morphological characteristics of potential microfossils, might provide additional constraints for this purpose. The complex multistage hydrothermal history of the brecciated Apex chert [91,99] makes it challenging to interpret the primary versus secondary origin of carbonaceous matter. In contrast, cherts resulting from sediment deposition in shallow marine environments such as those from the Strelley Pool Formation clearly provide a less confused window for distinguishing Paleoarchean microfossils from abiotic artefacts.\nWacey et al. [100] have used optical microscopy, SIMS, TEM, and\nNanoSIMS, to document, down to the submicrometer scale, the morphological characteristics and the elemental and carbon isotopic compositions of spheroidal, ellipsoidal and tubular microstructures in a sandstone from the basal member of the 3.4 Ga Strelley Pool Formation. Spheroidal/ellipsoidal microstructures occur as clusters or chains and display morphological features similar to those of well-accepted microfossils from the 1.9 Ga Gunflint Formation (Canada) with an almost continuous wall containing carbon and nitrogen as evidenced by TEM and NanoSIMS analyses. These carbonaceous microstructures have 13Cdepleted compositions as revealed by SIMS measurements [100] and are sometimes associated with micrometric pyrite crystals having sulfur isotopic compositions consistent with the products of sulfur metabolisms [101]. These observations have led Wacey et al. [100] to interpret these carbonaceous microstructures as 3.4 Ga microfossils of sulfurmetabolizing cells.\nCarbonaceous microstructures interpreted as microfossils have also been reported in different chert horizons of the Strelley Pool Formation [102–108]. These objects are morphologically diverse, organized as film-like, spheroidal and lenticular forms. Spheroidal microstructures occur either as isolated individuals or as clusters while lenticular forms occur as isolated individuals, and clusters of either aligned or randomly oriented individuals, and chains [102–105].\nSIMS measurements performed on individual microstructures within petrographic thin sections show that they are composed of carbonaceous matter displaying heterogeneous, texture-specific, 13Cdepleted isotopic compositions and hydrogen-to-carbon ratio values, which have been interpreted as the marker of different carbon-fixation metabolisms and/or the result of selective preservation of distinct biomolecules during diagenesis [106,107].\nAbiotic alternatives have also been proposed for some of the Strelley Pool Formation microstructures. Hydrothermally generated spheroidal microstructures morphologically similar to those from the Strelley Pool black cherts have been reported in a Neoproterozoic (0.75 Ga) chert from the Callison Lake Formation, northwestern Canada [13]. Otherwise, Wacey et al. [109] have proposed that some of the spheroidal and lenticular microstructures previously described in the Strelley Pool sandstone (e.g. Ref. [100]), and cherts (e.g. Ref. [103]), could be abiotic artefacts formed through the silicification of vesicular volcanic glass fragments coated by organic matter. As stated by Wacey et al. [109]; various features of the Strelley Pool lenticular forms remain difficult to explain with this abiotic mechanism. The carbonaceous lenticular objects retain their structural integrity, morphological features (central body with a surrounding thin discoid flange of variable widths), and chain-like arrangements after they have been extracted from the rock by acid demineralization using HF and HCl, as demonstrated by SEM and TEM investigations [104]. In contrast, the disseminated carbonaceous matter coating some of the volcanogenic vesicles reported by Wacey et al. [109] does not display such morphological features and would not preserve its structural integrity after acid demineralization. In addition, the morphological characteristics of the lenticular objects co-vary with the sedimentary environment of their host cherts, which has been interpreted to reflect adaptive speciation of microorganisms [105].\nSTXM-based XANES spectroscopy investigations performed on individual lenticular and film-like microstructures have revealed that they are composed of nitrogen- and oxygen-rich organic molecules, which are similar to those found in younger organic microfossils from the Gunflint Formation, Canada, and appear to be morphotype-specific [108]. Such a high degree of organic molecular preservation is remarkable given that the Strelley Pool microfossils have been exposed to peak temperatures of ≅300 °C at some time during the 3.4 Ga long geological history of the Strelley Pool Formation, as indicated by their Raman spectral features [108]. Burial temperatures below 150 °C are indeed generally sufficient to lead to intense chemical degradation [110,111]. The silica matrix surrounding the Strelley Pool organic microstructures is likely to have played a key role in the preservation\nprocess, as previously proposed for organic microfossils from the younger Gunflint cherts [112]. Organic microfossils reported from the Strelley Pool cherts were interpreted to have been initially entombed within amorphous opaline silica [103], a fossilization mechanism that was experimentally demonstrated to minimize the molecular degradation of microorganisms when they are subsequently exposed to temperatures in the range 250–300 °C [113,114]. Of note, such molecular preservation persists even if opaline silica ends up being completely converted into thermally stable quartz, suggesting that the protection offered by the mineral matrix may indeed persist beyond the laboratory timescale [113].\nAltogether, these observations strongly support the hypothesis that these organic microstructures found in cherts of the Strelley Pool Formation are authentic organic microfossils. Nevertheless, experimental investigations using advanced technologies should be conducted to continually re-assess the possibility for alternative abiotic mechanisms including hydrothermal processes that might generate such morphologically and chemically complex organic microstructures."

      "heading" : "5. Mesoarchean and Neoarchean organic geochemical records",
      "text" : "Reports of bona-fide microfossil occurrences remain limited in Mesoarchean and Neoarchean sedimentary rocks [115], which may reflect a sampling bias towards the older Paleoarchean records. Nevertheless, spheroidal and lenticular microstructures interpreted as microfossils have been reported in Mesoarchean sedimentary rocks from both the Kaapvaal and Pilbara Cratons (e.g., Refs. [116–118]). Two studies, demonstrating the heightened use and value of in situ microchemical analyses, have shown that carbon isotopic data acquired by SIMS [107,119] on the large lenticular and spheroidal microfossils in the 3.0 Ga Farrel Quartzite had a weighted mean δ13C value of −37.0‰ (±0.4‰), which differed significantly from the background value of −32.7‰ (±0.6‰). The authors interpreted these data as both evidence for biogenicity and an autotrophic lifestyle. A recent study, based on nitrogen isotopic data acquired in situ using NanoSIMS on film-like and lenticular microstructures isolated from the Farrel Quartzite through acid demineralization, suggested that the lenticular microstructures were oxygen-producing microorganisms [118]. The morphological similarity of lenticular microfossils of the Farrel Quartzite with those of the ca. 3.4 Ga Strelley Pool Formation and the 3.4 Ga Onverwacht Group of South Africa was also interpreted as evidence for these microbiota could be the oldest known morphologically-preserved remains with a long-lived (400Ma) fossil record.\nContrasting the paucity of studies reporting organic microfossils, organic matter has been reported to be relatively abundant in Mesoarchean and Neoarchean stromatolitic carbonates [120–123]. Organic globules closely associated with aragonite, similar to those that occur in modern settings, have been reported in the 2.7 Ga stromatolites of the Tumbiana Formation [120,121]. Carbon isotopic data for nonmarine kerogens of the Tumbiana Formation, are posited to support the concept of a ‘Global Age of Methanotrophy’ at around 2.7 Ga [122,124–126] although not everyone is in agreement with this interpretation [127]. SIMS analyses of nanopyrites preserved within the organic laminae of the Tumbiana stromatolites show an extremely large range of δ34S values spanning from −33.7‰ to +50.4‰, interpreted to be the result of microbial sulfate reduction, with Rayleigh distillation, within microbial mats during early diagenesis [128]. Data acquired at these very small spatial scales, in exceptionally well-preserved sediments for their age, strongly support the idea that microbial processes operated in similar ways to those of modern microbial mat ecosystems (see also [129,130]).\nLarge, global compilations of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen isotopic data continue to be studied for clues about the evolution of the biogeochemical cycles of these elements, particularly as they relate to the inception of relevant metabolic processes and their timing [131,132].

Yet, there is little consensus on whether these putative transitions represent biological innovations or lags in responses of the entire Earth system. There is one transition marked by sulfur isotope geochemistry that, after continued investigations, still retains its status as a unidirectional and irreversible process and that is the Great Oxygenation Event, signifying the permanent presence of molecular oxygen in the atmosphere at around 2.3 Ga [134–137]. The isotopic composition of nitrogen bound into sedimentary kerogens deposited during this time does indicate that there were concomitant changes in the cycling of nitrogen in the oceans [138,139] as well as providing evidence for the presence of Neoarchean alkaline lake systems [140].\nOne additional and notable feature that is observed in Mesoarchean and Neoarchean sedimentary rocks is that they record some stratigraphically significant accumulations of total organic carbon (e.g. Ref. [141]), which is potentially sufficient for them to have served as effective source rocks for petroleum generation [142,143]. Yet, modeling of isotopic records preserved in these sedimentary rocks do not show significant increase in the burial fraction of organic carbon until the Paleoproterozoic [141,144,145]. On the other hand, trends in organic carbon isotopic data for Neoarchean organic-rich rocks from the Pilbara Craton strongly suggest that there was a transition from largely anaerobic microbial communities to a world where aerobiosis played an increasingly important role [124,146]."

      "heading" : "6. Concluding remarks and future prospects",
      "text" : "Technological advances have afforded series of complementary analytical techniques to investigate the Archean biosignature record at all spatial scales (see Table 1). The most ancient metasedimentary rocks on the Earth, namely the >3.8 Ga rocks from the Greenland and Canadian Cratons, might have recorded traces of early life processes. Yet, distinguishing traces of paleobiological activity from abiotic artefacts in these heavily altered rocks remains highly challenging and renders the existing data dubious, at best. Graphitization processes have inevitably degraded any original organic molecules, leaving only graphite particles which possess little relevant geochemical information for discerning their age and origin (see Fig. 1 and discussion about Eoarchean rocks). Younger and much less altered rocks preserved in the Paleo-, Meso- and Neo-archean geological formations have, in contrast, recorded multiple lines of evidence for early life activity. Even the most ancient Archean sedimentary cherts, whilst having a long and complex geological history so far believed to be incompatible with the chemical preservation of organic matter, may have instead a great potential for preserving molecular clues about the biochemical nature of the earliest biosphere. Not only the isotopic information has been preserved but also molecular information. Despite contamination issues that limit the use of bulk analyses such as GC-MS or NMR to reveal the molecular structures of organic compounds composing organic microfossils preserved in Archean cherts, such an analytical approach would be well suited for searching for molecular biosignatures in Martian rocks that will be collected for a future sample return mission. Along with other key factors of the fossilization process, such as the temperature, pressure and redox conditions, it is clear that mineralogy plays a critical role in the morphological and molecular preservation of fossilized microorganisms, as demonstrated by recent experimental studies [113,114,147–150]. Much experimental work remains to be done to precisely assess the taphonomic and diagenetic impact on organic matter preservation of mineral phases relevant for sedimentary and hydrothermal settings on the early Earth and, potentially, on Mars."
