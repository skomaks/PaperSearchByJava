In this study, highly efficient, crystalline, and nm-rang sized zerovalent zinc (nZVZn) catalyst was synthesized and used for removal of chlorpyrifos at semi-pilot scale. The nZVZn showed high activity and caused 55% removal of CPY at 90min time under the conditions of [CPY]0¼ 10mg/L, [nZVZn]0¼1.0 g/L, and flow rate of the reactor¼ 0.2 L/min. Using identical conditions of [CPY]0, [nZVZn]0 and flow rate, the use of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) promoted the performance of nZVZn and caused 99.5% removal of CPY at [PMS]0¼ 40mg/L. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy studies revealed that nZVZn catalyzed PMS reactions yield hydroxyl and sulfate radicals that degraded CPY and removal of CPY was suppressed by applying radical scavengers. The nZVZn catalyzed PMS based removal of CPY was optimum at high [PMS]0, [nZVZn]0 and low pH of solution. The flow rate of the pilot plant reactor also influenced the degradation efficiency of CPY. High pH of solution, high [CPY]0 as well as use of alcohols, NOM, and some inorganic ions inhibited removal of CPY by nZVZn catalyzed PMS. The analysis of degradation products (DPs) of CPY were used to propose degradation pathways of CPY. The high TOC removal of CPY, low leaching of Zn2þ from Zn0 into aqueous solution, and toxicity reduction of CPY suggest the nZVZn catalyzed PMS process to be highly effective and environmental benign for treatment of CPY.\n© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

      "text" : "Chlorpyrifos (CPY, O,O-diethyl O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl) phosphorothioate), a chlorinated organophosphate pesticide is widely used on different crops and vegetables, such as sugar cane, rice, wheat, citrus fruits and potato etc. to kill chewing and sucking insects, mites, and pests (Chen et al., 2012; Thengodkar and Sivakami, 2010). As a consequence, CPY causes widespread\nS.

The CPY contamination in aquatic system has been stated to affect cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, reproductive, and immune systems (Bicker et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2012; Oliver et al., 2000). In addition, degradation of CPY in aquatic environment yield DPs and some of these DPs are reportedly highly hostile (Chen et al., 202; Li et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2008). It is highly desirable to measure toxicities of CPY and its DPs for the establishment of effective water treatment technologies. The advance oxidation technologies (AOTs) that uses reactive radicals, i.e., hydroxyl radical (COH) and sulfate radical (SO4Ce), are highly rewarding for decontamination of toxic contaminants (Dhaka et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2014). However, the COH based AOTs (i.e., HR-AOTs) are inclined by water quality\nzed peroxymonosulfate based advanced oxidation technologies for study, Journal of Cleaner Production, https://doi.org/10.1016/\nparameters that eventually minimize their potential applications for treating persistent toxic contaminants (Anipsitakis and Dionysiou, 2004; He et al., 2013). On contrary, the SO4Ce based AOTs (i.e., SR-AOTs) are considered to be least affected by water quality parameters and also capable of eliminating wide classes of refractory toxic organic pollutants (Sayed et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014). Persulfate anion, e.g., peroxymonosulfate (PMS, HSO5 ) that yields COH and SO4Ce simultaneously under heterolytic fission by metals or irradiation or heat is selected as an oxidant in the present study (Anipsitakis and Dionysiou, 2004; Shah et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2014). Besides, the high electron accepting capability due to lower unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), low cost, and greater efficiency make attractive the use of HSO5 for production of HR and SR as well as degradation of toxic contaminants (Anipsitakis and Dionysiou, 2004; Sayed et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2013). The continuous metal supply as well as high cost minimize the use of transition metals and other activating processes for the yield of COH and SO4Ce from HSO5 activation (Anipsitakis and Dionysiou, 2004; Antoniou et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2009). Alternatively, nano zerovalent metals (nZVMs, Ms0) technologies introduced are reported to be highly effective for activation of HSO5 into COH and SO4Ce (Sun et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2018). The gradual supply of metal ions, ease quenching of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and low cost make the use of nZVMs preferable for activation of HSO5 and other oxidants (Oh et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2010).\nAmong the nZVMs, nano zerovalent iron (nZVI) has been extensively applied for activation of HSO5 and other oxidants as well as degradation of toxic pollutants (Oh et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2010). In this study, nano zerovalent zinc metal (nZVZn, Zn0) due to its high reduction potential than nZVI (i.e., EoZn/ Zn\n2þ¼ 0.763 V, EoFe/Fe2þ ¼ 0.441 V), non-toxic nature, and low cost is selected for activation of HSO5 into COH and SO4Ce and degradation of CPY (Han et al., 2013; Roberts et al., 1996; Sarathy et al., 2010). Moreover, the contribution of nZVZn in degrading toxic pollutants and activating peroxides is rarely explored. Contrary to the earlier studies done at laboratory scale, the present study has been done at semi-pilot scale involving treatment of large volume of target contaminants in an attempt to mimic almost realistic conditions.\nThe overarching goal of the present study was developing nZVZn catalyst and assessment of the latter for removal and toxicity reduction of the CPY and its DPs. Semi-pilot scale conditions were used so as to approach the problem in a more realistic way. The nZVZn catalyst was synthesized by chemical reduction method and investigated for morphological characteristics using X-ray diffraction (XRD), filed emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analyzer. The as-synthesized nZVZn was used for degradation of CPY and key factors involved in CPY degradation under the condition of only nZVZn were investigated. Performances of nZVZn to degrade CPY were also investigated in the presence of HSO5 . The influence of various process parameters that affect catalytic activity of nZVZn and activation of HSO5 have been investigated in depth in this study. Chronic and acute toxicities of CPY and leaching of zinc ion from Zn0 into aqueous solution have been studied as thesewere crucial to suggest the greenness, sustainability, and environmentally friendly nature of the proposed treatment technologies. Further, TOC removal of CPY, proposed pathways of CPY degradation, and concentrations of some of the DPs have also been assessed in the present study.\nPlease cite this article as: Shah, N.S et al., Nano zerovalent zinc cataly treatment of chlorpyrifos in aqueous solution: A semi-pilot scale j.jclepro.2019.119032"

The synthesized BH4 solution was poured into burette and added slowly drop-by-drop into the Zn2þ solution followed by continuous slow stirring. The initial addition of BH4 solution led to the immediate formation of nZVZn precipitate and this addition was sustained till the transfer of all NaBH4 solution in-order to get maximum nZVZn precipitate formation. The aqueous layer from resulting Zn0 precipitate was removed and the precipitate obtained was thenwashed three times with ethanol to make inert layer on the surface of the synthesized material for preventing the access of air. The prepared materials were finally transferred into petri-dish and dried in oven at 60 C for 6 h. After drying, the as-prepared Zn0 were stored in air tight N2 purged vial and then processed for characterization and treatment of CPY."

The operation of the reactor includes driving of CPY solution (10mg/L) along with HSO5 (40mg/L) from the storage tank, passed through nZVZn (1.0 g/L) at an optimum flow rate (0.2 L/min). After each treatment, 3mL of the treated solution was taken and afterward analyzed with Agilent 7890 series gas chromatography (GC) coupled with Agilent 5975 mass spectrometry (MS) detector to quantify CPY as well as identify DPs of CPY. The analysis was achieved with solid-phase microextraction (SPME, using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber, and bought from Supelco, USA) and an HP-5MS capillary column (5% phenyl methylsiloxane, 30m, i.d. 0.25 mm). SPME fiber was fitted with manual holder for direct injection of the sample into GCeMS. The temperature of the injector, MS source, and MS quad were set at 250 C, 240 C, and 170 C, respectively. The oven temperature was initiated from 60 C (hold time 3min) to 170 C (hold for time 2min) at 20 C/min rate followed by increase to 230 C (hold time 10min) at 10 C/min rate. The mobile phase used was helium gas (with purity of 99.9995%) at 1.2mL/min flow rate.

The peak (284.5 eV) corresponding to C 1s is thought to signal the presence of adventitious elemental carbon and is in agreement with the reported literature (SalterBlanc and Tratnyek, 2011). The presence of O 1s peak could be due to ZneO by absorbing O2 and water (Dong et al., 2015). The high resolution XPS of Zn 2P illustrates the corresponding peaks for Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 at 1020.93 and 1044.02 eV, respectively (Fig. 1g).

The treatment by HSO5 only, Zn0 only, Zn2þ/HSO5 , and Zn0/HSO5 resulted into 10, 55, 78, and 99.5% removal of CPY, respectively, at a fix reaction time, i.e., 90min (Fig. 2). HSO5 being strong oxidant having high oxidation potential cause autoxidation of the test pollutant and this might be the probable reason for 10% CPY removal under the condition of only HSO5 in our study (Shah et al., 2015). When in contact with dissolved oxygen, Zn0(s) undergoes corrosion and is oxidized into Zn2þ(aq) and aqueous electron (eaq ) as\nzed peroxymonosulfate based advanced oxidation technologies for study, Journal of Cleaner Production, https://doi.org/10.1016/\nPlease cite this article as: Shah, N.S et al., Nano zerovalent zinc cataly treatment of chlorpyrifos in aqueous solution: A semi-pilot scale j.jclepro.2019.119032\nIn addition, the contact of CPY with nZVZn particles in the reactor could lead to accumulation of CPY on the surface of nZVZn and caused its removal. The moderately high surface area of 10m2/g for nZVZn, as determined by BET surface area analysis, suggest accumulation of CPY on the surface of nZVZn and could be another probable cause for enhnaced removal of CPY under the condition of only nZVZn.\nHowever, maximum removal of CPY was achieved by Zn2þ/ HSO5 and Zn0/HSO5 pairs which was possibly due to the formation of HR and SR in both Zn2þ/HSO5 and Zn0/HSO5 as shown in reactions (6) and (7). In Zn2þ/HSO5 and Zn0/HSO5 , the metal Zn2þ and Zn0 catalyzes HSO5 into COH and SO4Ce (reactions (6) and (7)) (Sayed et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2014). The COH and SO4Ce are strong oxidants having high oxidation potential and thus readily attack target contaminants, causing their degradation into DPs as shown in reactions (8) and (9) (Shah et al., 2013, 2018; Tan et al., 2014).\nzed peroxymonosulfate based advanced oxidation technologies for study, Journal of Cleaner Production, https://doi.org/10.1016/\ne aq þ HSO 5/ SO2 4 þ OH (6)\ne aq þ HSO 5/ OH þ SO 4 (7)\nOH SO 4 þ CPY/Intermediates (8)\nOH SO 4 þ Intermediates/DPs (9)\nIn all the tested processes, maximum removal of CPY was obtained in the Zn0/HSO5 process which was possibly due to: (a) accumulation of CPYon the surface of Zn0; (b) reduction of CPY by Zn0; and (c) degradation of CPY by COH and SO4Ce generated from Zn0 catalyzed HSO5 reaction. Scavenger studies employing i-PrOH as the bothCOH and SO4Ce scavenger (e.g., k OH=i PrOH ¼ 1:9 109 (M s) 1 and kSO 4 =i PrOH ¼ 8:2 107(M s) 1) (Buxton et al., 1988; Shah et al., 2013) while tBuOH for scavenging COH only, e.g., (k OH=t BuOH ¼ 6:0 108 (M s) 1) (Buxton et al., 1988; Zhu et al., 2019) were performed to elucidate the generation of COH and SO4Ce in the Zn0 catalyzed HSO5 reactions and further confirm the COH and SO4Ce role in CPY degradation. When i-PrOH and t-BuOH was used with Zn0/HSO5 , removal efficiency of CPY was dropped from 99.5% to 36% and 42%, respectively, which suggest that Zn0 catalyzed HSO5 based process yieldsCOH and SO4Ce and both the radicals significantly participate in the degradation of CPY (Fig. S3, Supporting Information).\nTo further investigate production of COH and SO4Ce in the nZVZn catalyzed HSO5 reaction, electron spin resonance (ESR) study, employing DMPO as the COH and SO4Ce spin trapping agent, was performed. The ESR result as depicted in Fig. S4 (Supporting Information) showed no peaks at the start of reaction which suggest no decomposition of HSO5 by nZVZn into COH or SO4Ce. However, when both nZVZn and HSO5 were added and reaction was started, adducts of DMPO-SO4 and DMPO-OHwere formed at a treatment time of 20minwhich suggest that HSO5 was activated by nZVZn into COH and SO4Ce (Shah et al., 2019). When the treatment time was increased to 40min, the intensities of both DMPO-SO4 and DMPO-OH adducts significantly increased which suggest increase in the rate of formation of COH as well as SO4Ce and consequently showed more response to ESR.\nTo better explore COH as well as SO4Ce role in CPY degradation, competition kinetic studies were done to investigate COH and SO4Ce reactivities with CPY, e.g., k OH=CPY and kSO 4 =CPY, respectively, employing p-CBA as the COH competitor, e.g., k OH=p CBA ¼ 5:0 109 (M s) 1 whilem-TA as the SO4Ce competitor, e.g., kSO 4 =m TA ¼ 2:0 109 (M s)\n1 (Shah et al., 2013). In calculating the reactivity of COH with CPY, high concentration of oxetnae (i.e., 50mg/L) was used as a SO4Ce scavenger (due to their fast kinetics) with Zn0/HSO5 while for calculating the reactivity of SO4Ce with CPY, high concentration of 2-butanol (i.e., 50mg/L) was used as a scavenger for COH (due to their fast kinetics) (Buxton et al., 1988; Shah et al., 2016).

(2016) reported that elevating level of HSO5 enhanced the production rate of HR and SR that in return led to maximum degradation of the target contaminant at high [HSO5 ]0 and was consistent to the trend observed in our study.\nEffect of nZVZn load: Secondly, the effects of different load of nZVZn, i.e., [Zn0]0¼ 0.25e2.0 g/L were assessed on the catalytic degradation of CPY in a semi-pilot reactor using constant CPY and\nzed peroxymonosulfate based advanced oxidation technologies for study, Journal of Cleaner Production, https://doi.org/10.1016/\nHSO5 concentrations, i.e., 10mg/L and 40mg/L and reactor flow rate as 0.2 L/min (Fig. 4). The catalytic degradation of CPY by Zn0\nwith the added HSO5 increased from 57 to 99.2% with increasing [Zn0]0 from 0.25 to 2,0 g/L, respectively, at 60min time (Fig. 4). This increase in degradation efficiency of CPY with increasing [Zn0]0 could be attributed to the boost in the COH and SO4Ce production rate. Since nZVZn is used as the catalyst for decomposition of HSO5 into COH as well as SO4Ce, thus elevating level of [Zn0]0 could correspondingly increase the COH and SO4Ce formation rate which was similar to the results achieved in previous published works (Sayed et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2016). Besides, increasing load of nZVZn is expected to increase the number of active sites on the nZVZn surface that subsequently might lead to higher accumulation of CPY molecules.\nEffect of [CPY]0: Thirdly the effects of different [CPY]0 from 2.5 to 20mg/L were investigated on the catalytic degradation of CPY by Zn0 catalyzed HSO5 based process, keeping constant Zn0 and HSO5 concentrations of 1.0 g/L and 40mg/L, respectively, and reactor flow rate at 0.2 L/min. The effects of varying [CPY]0 is beneficial to suggest guidelines level of Zn0, HSO5 , and flow rate for optimum removal of CPY under its different concentrations. The results as shown in Fig. 5 depicts decline in removal efficiency of CPY from 90% to 48% with leveling up initial concentration of CPY from 2.5 to 20mg/L, respectively, at 30min reaction times. These findings were similar to those observed in earlier published works (Sayed et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2019). The low removal efficiency of CPY at high [CPY]0 is attributed to: (a) reduction in the ratio of COH and SO4Ce to CPY; (b) competition between CPYand its DPs forCOH and SO4Ce that subsequently is likely to increase with increasing [CPY]0; and (c) greater competition between CPY molecules itself as well as with its DPs for active sites on the nZVZn surface (Shah et al., 2013,"

The degradation rate was found to be maximum for an initial CPY concentration of 20mg/L and least for the 2.5mg/L (data not shown). These results were consistent to those obtained in previous\nPlease cite this article as: Shah, N.S et al., Nano zerovalent zinc cataly treatment of chlorpyrifos in aqueous solution: A semi-pilot scale j.jclepro.2019.119032\nstudy (Shah et al., 2013). The possible reason for high degradation rate for high concentration of CPY looks to be due the availability of maximum number of CPY molecules for reactive radicals as compared to that at lower concentration of CPY (Shah et al., 2013).\nEffect of Flow rate: In the case of continuous flow reactor for treating wastewater, the flow rate of solution from the tank play vigorous role in catalytic degradation of water contaminants. Thus catalytic degradation of CPY was studied at varying flow rate from 0.05 to 0.4 L/min while keeping initial concentrations of CPY, Zn0, and HSO5 constant at 10mg/L, 1.0 g/L, and 40mg/L, respectively. The results suggested showed enhanced catalytic degradation of CPY by Zn0 with the added HSO5 initially with increasing flow rate from 0.05 to 0.2 L/min, however, declined with further increasing the flow rate to 0.4 L/min (Fig. 6). This optimum removal of CPY with initially raising the flow rate could be due to: (1 maximum contact between the CPYmolecules and the catalyst surface; and (2\nzed peroxymonosulfate based advanced oxidation technologies for study, Journal of Cleaner Production, https://doi.org/10.1016/\nincreased corrosion of the catalyst due to dissolved oxygen andwas in agreement to the tendency observed in the earlier reports (Bansal et al., 2018; Sayed et al., 2019). However, further increase in flow rate from 0.2 to 0.4 L/min decreased CPY degradation. It has been reported that high flow rate decrease contact time of pollutant with the catalyst and consequently pollutant passes over the surface of the catalysts and (Sayed et al., 2019). Thus 0.2 L/min was chosen as the finest reactor flow rate in our study.\nThe kinetics of the catalytic degradation of CPY by Zn0 activated HSO5 under the conditions of varying [Zn0]0, [HSO5 ]0, [CPY]0, and flow rate were examined and found pseudo-first-order."

      "text" : "Effects of pH: The change in pH has been found to influence catalytic activity of the catalyst, oxidation potential of both hydroxyl and sulfate radical, catalytic decomposition of HSO5 and the target contaminant, and chemistry of HSO5 , thus removal of CPY by Zn0/HSO5 was investigated at varying pH from 2.5 to 10.5 (Antoniou et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010). The results showed that Zn0 with the added HSO5 achievedmaximum removal of CPY (i.e., 99.5%) at pH 2.5 versus 49% at pH 10.5 at 90min reaction time (Fig. 7). Previous studies show that lowering pH cause rapid conversion of zerovalent metal intometal ions and thus led to rapid decomposition of HSO5 into COH and SO4Ce and this might be the probable cause for optimum CPY degradation at pH 2.5 in our study (Tan et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2016). The pKa value of CPY is reported to be 5.1 that mean CPY surface to bear negative charge at a pH greater than 5.1 and positive charge at a pH less than 5.1 (AlMeqbali et al., 1998). At lower pH (i.e., pH< 5.1) the positively charged CPY tend to react efficiently with negatively charged HSO5 and SO4Ce species and consequently resulted into optimal CPY degradation at a pH of 2.5 in our study. The retard corrosion of zerovalent metal and formation of metal hydroxide complexes has been stated to lower the catalytic activity of zerovalent metals at high pH and might be the probable cause for minimal removal of CPY at high pH in our study (Sayed et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2016). Other possible reasons for low removal of CPY at high\nPlease cite this article as: Shah, N.S et al., Nano zerovalent zinc cataly treatment of chlorpyrifos in aqueous solution: A semi-pilot scale j.jclepro.2019.119032\npH include: (a) scavenging of COH and SO4Ce by eOH; (b) change in chemical nature of HSO5 ; and (c) low redox potential of COH (Buxton et al., 1988; Neta et al., 1988).\nEffects of NOM and inorganic ions presence: Inorganic ionic species and natural organic matters (NOM) are important constituents of real water and have been found to significantly affect removal of water contaminants involving COH and SO4Ce (Shah et al., 2013, 2019). To better explore performance of the Zn0 catalyzed HSO5 process in degradation of the target contaminants for potential practical applications, the effects of NOM and common inorganic ionic additives were considered crucial to be investigated in our study. The results show significant inhibitory effects of NOM and some of the ions on the catalytic degradation of CPY by Zn0/HSO5 (Table 1). The competitive adsorption on the surface of Zn0 and competition of NOM and ions with CPY for reactions with COH and SO4Ce looked to be the possible reasons for the inhibited degradation of CPY using Zn0/HSO5 with the added NOM and ions. The inhibitory effects of NOM and ions on the catalytic degradation of CPY by Zn0 catalyzed HSO5 were observed in the order of NO2 > CO32 >HCO3 NOM> Cl > Fe2þ> Cuþ>NO3 (Table 1).\nNO2 due to its high second-order rate constants with COH and SO4Ce (reactions (12) and (13)) might compete meaningfully with CPY forCOH and SO4Ce, the latter become less available for reacting with the CPY molecule, and consequently restrained removal of CPY to greater extent by Zn0/HSO5 (Buxton et al., 1988; Shah et al., 2013). Removal efficiency of CPY by Zn0 catalyzed HSO5 was reduced to larger amount by spiking CO32 and HCO3 too in the reaction solution. Both COH and SO4Ce species react fast with CO32 and HCO3 anions as shown in reactions 14e17 and could lower the reactivity of the former with CPY (Buxton et al., 1988; Shah et al., 2018, 2019). The addition of CO32 and HCO3 has been reported to raise pH of solution and high pH inhibit degradation of CPY by Zn0/ HSO5 as already discussed somewhere in this study (Shah et al., 2018, 2019). The degradation efficiency of CPY by Zn0/HSO5 was restrained greatly by NOM too, which was possibly due to its high second-order rate constants with COH as well as SO4Ce as shown in reactions 18 and 19. This could lead to consequently larger competition of NOM with CPY for COH and SO4Ce (Buxton et al., 1988; Shah et al., 2013). However, degradation of CPY by Zn0/ HSO5 was slightly inhibited by Cl , Fe2þ, and Cuþ despite their high kinetics with both COH and SO4Ce as depicted in reactions (20)e(25) (Buxton et al., 1988; Shah et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2010). The reactions (20)e(22) show that reactions of Cl with COH and SO4Ce form highly reactive ClOHC , ClC, and COH that might contribute in the degradation of CPY (Buxton et al.,1988; Shah et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2010). The activation of HSO5 by Cl has been reported that might be another probable cause for low inhibiting\nTable 1 Effects of NOM and inorganic ions on the removal efficiency (%) of CPY by Zn0 with the added HSO5 .

Thus, removal of TOC of CPY by Zn0 catalyzed HSO5 based process was considered highly vital in our study. The TOC removal of organic pollutants has been reported to be a multistep complex process, thus treatment of CPY by Zn0/HSO5 was done for 900min under high concentrations of CPY, Zn0, and HSO5 , i.e., 40mg/L, 4.0 g/L, and 200mg/L, respectively, and at 0.2 L/min flow rate (Khan et al., 2013; Riga et al., 2007). Fig. 8 depicts that TOC removal of CPY was slower initially, however, increased at higher treatment time and caused 76% TOC removal of CPYat 900min time.

The organic DPs of CPY were analyzed using GC-MS while IC analysis was used for the identification of inorganic DPs. Figs. S5(aed) in Supporting Information depicts MS spectra of CPY and some of its DPs as a tool to know the way of mass spectral treatment of CPY and its DPs. Total of 10 organic products as shown in Scheme 1 and two inorganic DPs, i.e., Cl and CH3COO were found to be formed from COH and SO4Ceemediated degradation of CPY in our study. The organic DPs evolved from CPY degradation could not be recognized to be formed either due to COH and SO4Ce since both the radicals undergo common mechanisms and thus the resulting DPs were consigned to COH as well as SO4Ce (Sayed et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2013). The easy sites in CPY molecule for the attack of COH and SO4Ce have been reported to be the chlorine attached to N-containing ring and the P]S double bond (Liu et al., 2019). The pathway-I was undertaken by the attack of the COH and SO4Ce at the carbon bearing chlorine group, resulting in the loss of chloride through a series of reactions and form hydroxylated product, DP1 (Scheme 1).

The DP2 through a series of reactions undergo bond cleavage between O and C of the N-containing ring and yield DP3 and DP4 in one case while hydroxylation at the PeOeC bond and yielded product DP5 in the other case (Liu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2017). The DP5 further yielded DP4 through the loss of phosphoric acid and this is reported in previous study too (Liu et al., 2019). The pathway-II is followed by the attack ofCOH and SO4Ce on the P]S bond of CPY, causing its oxidation into P]O group and give DP6 as shown in Scheme 1 (Liu et al., 2019). The hydroxylation of DP6 and loss of ether group results into formation of DP7 in one case while the loss of chlorine group and bond cleavage between O and C (attached to the ring bearing N group) led to the formation of DP10 and DP3 in another case (Liu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2017). The loss of DP3 has been stated in earlier published work also (Zhou et al., 2017). The attack of COH and SO4Ce at DP7 led to the loss of chloride and results in the formation of hydorxylated product, DP8 that undergo further reactions with reactive radicals and produced DP9 after losing phosphoric acid and chloride following several intermediate steps.\nThe inorganic DPs, i.e., Cl and CH3COO possibly formed from the degradation of CPY by nZVZn catalyzed HSO5 were investigated using IC method as discussed above in the present study.

The rapid decay of CPY was followed by increase in concentrations of both the CH3COO and Cl at initial treatment time, however, after prolonged treatment, concentration of CH3COO happened to decrease while that of Cl continuously increased.

The calculated concentration of Zn2þ was much less than its maximum permissible concentration of 3.0mg/L proposed by the World Health Organization.

The stability of nZVZn was estimated from leaching of small concentration of Zn2þ into aqueous solution. The as-synthesized zinc material was found to be highly crystalline and nano-sized with high surface area. The as-synthesized Zn0 was highly effective in the removal of CPY and showed high activity in the presence of HSO5 . The removal of CPY by Zn0 alone was found due to aqueous electron and adsorption. However, removal of CPY was due to COH and SO4Ce under the condition of Zn0 catalyzed HSO5 based process. The COH and SO4Ce presented high reactivities with CPY and were found to be actively involved in CPY degradation. The COH and SO4Ce production rate affected the removal of CPY and degradation of CPY was declined by using HR and SR scavengers. The kinetic of the removal of CPY by Zn0 catalyzed HSO5 was pseudo-first-order. The pH of aqueous solution, and use of alcohols, NOM representative, and some of the inorganic ionic species influenced the removal of CPY by Zn0 catalyzed HSO5 based process. The highest removal CPY by Zn0/HSO5 was achieved at pH2.5 and reactor flow rate of 0.2 L/min. The proposed pathways of CPY degradation by COH and SO4Ce were established and the DPs evolved were formed due to electron transfer, replacement, hydroxylation, bond cleavage, and oxidation reactions. The DPs were found to compete with CPY for reactive radicals and thus inhibited CPY removal at its high concentration.

    "abstractText" : "Chlorpyrifos (CPY), an organophosphate pesticide is largely used throughout the world on different crops for the control of pests and causes severe health and environmental issues. In this study, highly efficient, crystalline, and nm-rang sized zerovalent zinc (nZVZn) catalyst was synthesized and used for removal of chlorpyrifos at semi-pilot scale. The nZVZn showed high activity and caused 55% removal of CPY at 90min time under the conditions of [CPY]01⁄4 10mg/L, [nZVZn]01⁄41.0 g/L, and flow rate of the reactor1⁄4 0.2 L/min. Using identical conditions of [CPY]0, [nZVZn]0 and flow rate, the use of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) promoted the performance of nZVZn and caused 99.5% removal of CPY at [PMS]01⁄4 40mg/L. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy studies revealed that nZVZn catalyzed PMS reactions yield hydroxyl and sulfate radicals that degraded CPY and removal of CPY was suppressed by applying radical scavengers. The nZVZn catalyzed PMS based removal of CPY was optimum at high [PMS]0, [nZVZn]0 and low pH of solution. The flow rate of the pilot plant reactor also influenced the degradation efficiency of CPY. High pH of solution, high [CPY]0 as well as use of alcohols, NOM, and some inorganic ions inhibited removal of CPY by nZVZn catalyzed PMS. The analysis of degradation products (DPs) of CPY were used to propose degradation pathways of CPY. The high TOC removal of CPY, low leaching of Zn2þ from Zn0 into aqueous solution, and toxicity reduction of CPY suggest the nZVZn catalyzed PMS process to be highly effective and environmental benign for treatment of CPY. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
