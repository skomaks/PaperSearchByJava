      "text" : "Nanotechnology is a mindset, even though the scientific community is fascinated with the field of nanoscience, most of the ongoing discussions, definitions, and attention is focused on nanotechnology. As such, it represents a broad term which demonstrates the apotheosis of man’s ceaseless urge for knowledge having practical potential. Themeaning of the term nanotechnology is any technology operating on the nanoscale which has applications in the real world, that is, to employ single atoms andmolecules to form functional structures [1]. The field of nanotechnology involves the creation and utilization of chemical, physical, and biological systems with structural features between single atoms or molecules to submicron dimensions, and also the assimilation of resultant nanostructures into larger systems [2, 3].\nThe simplest definition of nanotechnology is “technology on the nanoscale.” Subsequently, various definitions of nanotechnology have evolved. This original definition requires further development, such as a definition of what is meant by nanoscale. Thus we cannot properly define nanotechnology unless we define “nanoscale,” that is, a scale covering 1–100nm. A brief definition of nanotechnology is an “atomically precise technology” or “engineering with atomic precision” [4]. Nanotechnology is connected with systems and materials, the components and structures of which represent novel, significantly improved chemical, physical, and biological properties, processes, and phenomena because of their nanoscale size. The dictionary definition of nanotechnology is “the design, characterization, manufacture and shape and size-controlled application of matters in the nanoscale” [5]. A substitute definition from the same dictionary is “the careful and controlled manipulation, precision placement, modeling, measurement, and production of materials at the nanoscale in order to make matters, systems, and devices by fundamentally novel properties and functions” [5].Nanotechnology is a branch of knowledge, within a subclassification of technology in colloidal science, chemistry, physics, biology, and other scientific fields, encompassing the study of phenomena at the nanoscale [6]. Interface Science and Technology, Vol. 28. https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-813586-0.00001-8 © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1\nThe essence and promise of nanoscience and nanotechnology are illustrated in the fact that the properties of materials (i.e., chemical, physical, and biological) at the nanoscale may be quite different from those within a bulk material [7]. When the dimensions of a material are reduced below 100nm dramatic alterations may occur in their properties [7]. Materials therefore might be nanostructured in order to provide a specific performance or to provide new properties to a material in addition to changes linked specifically to size and structure. Such macromolecules and particles made of a small number of molecules, at sizes of 1–50nm, possess distinct physicochemical properties [8]. Compared with bulk materials, nanoparticles (NPs) possess properties of increased performance when they are used for similar applications. The definition of an NP is a collective of atoms bonded together with an average radius between 1 and 100nm, i.e., typically consisting of 10–105 atoms [9]. A significant application of NPs is the manufacture of a new class of catalysts, identified as nanocatalysts [10]. Considerable advances are being made in fields that contribute to the manufacture and detailed understanding of the nature (particle size, composition, and structure) and function of NPs as catalysts for the improved performance of chemical reactions [11]. The reason for a catalysts performance is a powerful function of its particle size and size distribution. The chemical properties of NPs provide them with advantages as catalysts, such as their large surface-to-volume ratio, surface morphology, and electronic properties, all of which are linked to particle size [6, 12].\nThe discovery of new materials, phenomena, and processes at the nanoscale, and the advancement of novel theoretical and experimental techniques for research, provide novel chances for the advancement of inventive nanostructured materials and nanosystems. There are many current and expected advancements in nanoscale science and nanotechnology in terms of its applications in agriculture, electronics, medicine, energy, etc. These developments are being made at an increasing rate [10, 13].\nNanotechnology can play a significant role in the extension of innovative methods used to create new products, to substitute present production equipment, to reformulate novel materials and chemicals toward improved performance resulting in reduced material and energy consumption, to reduce harm to the environment, and also for environmental remediation [14]. Although a decreased consumption of matter and energy benefits the environment, nanotechnology provides the exciting possibility to remediate problems via a more sustainable route. Environmental applications of nanotechnology include the development of solutions to current environmental problems, measures to address both the ensuing problems from interactions of material and energy with the environment, and the possible risks associated with nanotechnology [14]."

      "heading" : "1.2 THE IMPORTANCE OF NANOSCALE MATERIALS",
      "text" : "The Greek prefix “nano” is derived from the word “dwarf” and refers to a reduction in size, or time, of 10 9, which is 1000 times smaller than a micron [15].\nThe nanometer (nm) scale is typically defined as one billionth of a meter or three to five atoms in width—equivalent to 10Å or smaller than one tenth of a micrometer in at least one dimension. However, the term nanoscale is sometimes used even for materials smaller than 1mm. Also, 1 nm is 10 9 m or 10,000 times less than the diameter of a human hair. Due to study materials with morphological characteristics at the nanoscale, a science-based approach has been derived in the field of nanomaterials, especially applied to those nanomaterials that have special properties [15]. Fig. 1.1 shows size ranges for various microscale and nanoscale objects. Nanoscience and nanotechnology operates with very small objects and systems [16]. Nanoscience studies are defined as those that deal with matter and systems having the following key properties:\nl Have at least one dimension less than 10nm. l Utilize methodologies that illustrate the fundamental control of the physi-\ncal and chemical characteristics of molecular-scale structures (process).\nl Permit the manufacture of larger structures (building block property).\nNormally, nanotechnology is used in nature for the synthesis of bioentities in the body, such as proteins, enzymes, carbohydrates, DNA, RNA, and viruses, forming the components of cellular structures. As a general concept, nanoscience is really representative of nature in the biological sciences, i.e., the size of many molecular structures in biology falls within the nanoscale range of 1–100nm [17]. The exploration of new materials, processes, and phenomena in the nanoscale, and the development of novel theoretical and experimental techniques of investigation, provides fresh opportunities for the advancement of innovative nanoscale matters and nanosystems. The nanoscale is regarded as a theurgic point on the dimensional scale; properties of materials in the nanoscale can be extremely different from those of materials at larger scales. Structures at the nanoscale (namely nanostructures) are regarded as bridging the smallest of artificial devices or atoms and the largest molecules in living systems or bulk materials [18].\nWhen the dimensions of a material are reduced from a large size to below 100nm, dramatic evolution can occur in their properties [19]. At the nanoscale, the most desirable properties can be achieved based on dominance of size confinement, distribution and morphology, interfacial phenomena, and quantum effects. Furthermore, the behavior of materials at the nanoscale is\nnot completely predictable in terms of what is distinguishable at the macroscale [9, 20]. The ability to control and manipulate nanostructures will eventually make it possible to exploit novel chemical, physical, and biological properties of systems which are intermediate in size, i.e., molecules, single atoms, and bulk materials [15]. Materials can be nanostructured in order to create novel properties and provide improved performance. There are many special reasons why the nanoscale has become very important and why this field has created new opportunities in science and technology. Some of these reasons are indicated below [16]:\n1. One important aspect of nanotechnology is its enhanced ratio of surface\narea to volume that exists in most nanoscale components. This provides possible new quantum mechanical (wavelike) effects. Thus the electronic properties of solids will be able to be changed with large reductions in particle size because of this “quantum size effect” [21]. For instance, NPs often have unforeseen visual properties due to the close confinement of their electrons creating quantum effects, such as gold NPs appearing deep red to black when in solution (Fig. 1.2). By applying a nanoscale design of materials, it is feasible to alter their microscopic and macroscopic properties, including melting temperatures, magnetization, and charge capacity without changing their chemical composition. This theoretically would not affect the density of the final product, although flow difficulties and the tendency of NPs to agglomerate would complicate matters. The surface effects of NPs also reduce incipient melting temperatures [16]. 2. Chemical properties at this scale provide an advantage for catalysis, due to\nlarge surface-to-volume ratios, and interfacial and surface chemistry, which is significant for many applications. Nanoscale materials are ideal for catalysis, composite materials, drug delivery, reacting systems, and energy storage. However, they are being applied in medicine too because\nof various properties, such as increased resistance to wear and the possibility of being used to kill bacteria. However, there are concerns linked to the potential consequences to the environment and human health [22].\nIn a similar manner to nanotechnology’s achievements in the production of consumer products, nanoscale materials have the potential to improve the environment, not only via material applications but also in terms of designing cleaner industrial procedures and constructing environmentally liable products [22]. The unique and novel properties of nanostructured materials, NPs, and other related nanotechnologies may offer benefits in terms of creating catalysts, materials of increased strength, and materials with adjustable photoactivity. In addition, such materials could be used to prepare solutions to face technological and environmental challenges in the fields of catalysis, medicine, solar energy conversion, and water treatment [9, 23]. 3. A key feature of molecular structures or biological entities in the body is\ntheir systematic organization at the nanoscale. Research and development in nanotechnology has allowed us to put man-made nanoscale objects into living cells [24]. Also, this technology has provided the possibility to investigate the microstructure and macrostructure of matter using molecular self-assembly. This certainly is a very powerful instrument in materials science [25]. 4. Macroscopic systems made up of nanostructures have a number of\nimproved mechanical properties, such as the improved strength and hardness of nanomaterials and light-weight nanocomposites, improved compression properties, and improved malleability. In addition, such systems can potentially have their molecular structures altered nanomechanically [26]. Furthermore, nanosystems can have much higher densities than those made up of microstructures, as well as being improved conductors of electricity—something which may spark the production of new electronic devices with more sophisticated functions, smaller and faster circuits, and significantly reduced power consumption simultaneously by controlling nanostructure interactions and complexity [23]."

      "heading" : "1.3 HISTORICAL ADVANCES IN NANOTECHNOLOGY",
      "text" : "For a long time, humans have been investigating “nano”-sized existence. The concept of nanotechnology is commonly attributed to the physicist and the famous Nobel Laureate Dr. Richard P. Feynman [27]. His classic science lectures were entitled “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom: An Invitation to Enter a New Field of Physics.”\nIn his lectures Feynman talked about being able to fit the entire Encyclopedia Britannica on the head of a needle, emphasizing that there was no law preventing such an undertaking. Feynman also explained that the laws of nature were not limited by our ability to work at the atomic and molecular levels, but that it was our lack of appropriate techniques and equipment which prevented\nthis. Feynman also talked about “how it is possible to write and read in atoms,” “storage of information on a small scale,” and “miniaturizing the computer.” He considered doing things very small via “extravagant biological systems,” as well as the possibility of having “better electron microscopes” that can take images of an atom. He contemplated “miniaturization by evaporation,” representing thin-film formation, “building tiny objects with atoms,” such as tiny machines, electronic circuits, and tiny factories, and “solving the problems of lubrication” by using nanorobotics. Also he suggested “rearranging atoms” to create diverse nanostructures and nanodevices. There is a document which mentions PbS nanocrystals being used in a procedure, used since Greco-Roman times, to color hair black [28]. Gold NPs have a long history in medicine. For example, in 1449 a Flemish glassmaker named John Utynam was granted a patent for manufacturing stained glass incorporating gold NPs in England; in the early 16th century a Swiss doctor and chemist von Hohenheim synthesized and administered gold NPs to patients suffering from certain illnesses; novel equivalents might include the magnetic NPs proposed for therapeutic purposes. It is important to note that almost all the ideas presented in Feynman’s lecture are undergoing vigorous research today, with various nanotechnology researchers working on them around the world [29].\nSome other successful applications that have come about as a result of Feynman’s lecture in 1959 include the manipulation of single atoms on a silicon surface, the trapping of single, 3D, nanometer-diameter colloidal particles from solution using electrostatic techniques, and the positioning of single atoms by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). In the early 1960s there was additional research being completed on small systems across a diverse range of subjects. For instance, two books were published entitled Thermodynamics of Small Systems (Parts I and II) by T.L. Hill in early 1960s—the consequence of which was the use of the term “nano thermodynamics” for the thermodynamics of small systems [30, 31]. In the 1960s, when Feynman identified and recommended the significance of nanotechnology, the essential devices for facilitating nanotechnology had not yet been invented. Research and development into small systems (nano) did not receive significant governmental research funding and subsequently received minor attention within the scientific community. Due to the significant impact of these new systems, and because of their enabling nature, they have the potential to be employed for applications in industry, defense, and other commercial enterprises. Additionally, federal governments have demonstrated a specific interest in the growth of this field. Although scientists have been working with NPs for decades, the effectiveness of their work has been limited due to their inability to identify the structure of NPs. Feynman did not specifically use the expression “nanotechnology,” the first use of which is attributed to Tanaguchi [32], who in 1974 presented a paper entitled “On the basic concept of nanotechnology.” Moreover, in the early 1980s, Prof. Eric Drexler, a lecturer and nanotechnology researcher, coined the term “nanotechnology.” He took\nFeynman’s concept of a billion tiny machines and added the idea that they could be computer controlled rather than being controlled by a human operator. He went on to suggest that such tiny machines might be able to make further copies of themselves. Drexler developed a pioneering text entitled Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology, popularizing the potential of nanotechnology [33]. Drexler predicted the bottom-up method whereby proteins could be used to manufacture complex nanomachines using customized specifications. Such a nanodevice would mimic biological processes and have specialized functions as well as undergoing self-replication and even self-destruction. In the 1980s, after the development of the scanning electron microscope, nanotechnology really started to take off. The “Feynman scale” (’ nman) was thus proposed [6]:\nOneFeynman ’½ 10 9 m¼ 10 3 m¼ 10 Å"

      "text" : "Numerous approaches in nanotechnology have been used successfully. As the technology develops further, new approaches will emerge. Generally, the approaches employed so far have been dictated by the background experiences of researchers and existing technology. Everyone recognizes the concept of nanotechnology, however, it has different meanings in various fields of science, such as physics and chemistry. In fact, nanotechnology is multidisciplinary, involving physics, chemistry, biology, electronics, engineering, and social sciences, all of which are requirement to unite in order to produce the next level of advancement in nanotechnology.\nFuel cells, molecular electronics, mechanically strong materials, nanobiological devices, quantum devices, diamondoid molecules, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, etc., have all been built using nanotechnology. “Rearranging the atoms” to construct different nanostructures and nanodevices, and consideration of the “demeanor of atoms in a small world” represent two nanotechnological categories, i.e., the top-down approach and atomic-scale fabrication representing the bottom-up approach [34, 35] (Fig. 1.3).\nThe “top-down” approach is based on the assembly of structures by manipulating components of much larger devices via monolithic processing—an approach more readily achieved using current technology. This approach has been used with remarkable success in semiconductor devices used in consumer electronics. On the other hand, the “bottom-up” approach, arranging atoms or molecules in nanostructures, involves the manufacture of device structures through the systematic self-assembly of molecules, atoms, or other basic units of matter [36]. As is shown in Fig. 1.4, this approach is the one that nature uses to repair organ systems, tissues, and cells in living organisms as well as for life processes including protein synthesis.\nThe development of new concepts for tools and machines on a molecular level is of significant interest not only to mainstream research, but also as a means to facilitate control of the synthesis and characterization of new nanostructures—potentially yielding a range of novel products in the near future. Miniaturization is one of the key developments such processes make feasible, permitting researchers to work on and produce ever smaller objects (Fig. 1.4). In order to do so, growingly advanced technology is needed [35]. In addition, the integration of ever smaller objects, coupled with a rise in their numbers, leads to novel implementations. The emergence of algorithms brings objects inspired through human genius closer to objects found in the biological world. Objects in the biological world are strictly organized and self-organizing, demonstrated by the chemical processes of self-assembling materials and supramolecular constructs."

      "heading" : "1.4.1 Top-Down Approach",
      "text" : "The miniaturization of components for building more efficient machines and devices is pursued via the top-down approach. The top-down approach begins\nby using a bulk material that is broken to smaller pieces via mechanical, chemical, or other forms of energy. The electronics industry is the most successful industry at using the top-down approach. This industry uses techniques that include a range of technologies, such as physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), lithography (photolithography, X-ray lithography, and electron beam), and wet and plasma etching, to produce functional structures at the micro/nanoscale (Fig. 1.5) [37–39]. This approach has led engineers and physicists to manipulate progressively smaller fragments of matter via photolithography and other techniques, and has been successful to date. Research and development of these technologies have facilitated the appearance of various electronic products and instruments and has enhanced global quality of life. The top-down approach has improved because of developments in deposition technology and equally\nimportantly because of the development of equipment associated with lithographic techniques. For example, X-ray lithography, electron-beam lithography, and ion-beam lithography techniques have achieved advantages in terms of resolution. However, there are disadvantages associated with such “optics,” i.e., cost and the damaging effects on substrates. Currently, these methods are under investigation in order to improve current lithographic processes that are applied in the integrated circuits industry. Due to continuous developments in these technologies, representing the transition from microtechnology to nanotechnology, a new generation of exciting features and products are being produced. Methods used for preparing different NPs include photolithography, ion-beam lithography, electron-beam lithography, atom lasers, coprecipitation, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), and LbL assembly. An example of how several techniques can be joined together to manufacture a special nanostructure is shown in Fig. 1.6 [37]. In this example, focused ion beam-chemical vapor deposition (FIB-CVD) was used.\nThe top-down approach is becoming increasingly appealing. For example, the miniaturization of computer technology on silicon-based chips is quickly approaching its upper limit [37, 38]. Specifically, for dimensions smaller than 100nm, photolithography has vigorous technical and economic limitations— its size is extremely small in terms of the standards of everyday life (from about 75mm to below 100nm or approximately one thousandth the width of a human hair) but large compared with atoms or molecules. Thus “there is plenty of room at the bottom” for considerable miniaturization, as Feynman presented in a famous talk. However, the top-down approach does not appear capable of offering such an opportunity."

      "heading" : "1.4.2 Bottom-Up Approach",
      "text" : "One of the most promising and alternative strategies for science and technology at the nanoscale is the bottom-up approach, which, it is assumed, will be the approach upon which nanotechnology will finally be implemented. This method is the opposite of the top-down approach. The bottom-up approach represents the self-assembly of atoms, molecules, and machines from basic chemical building blocks to make nanomaterials and nanodevices, enabling the development of macroscopic concepts for machines and devices at the molecular level. This approach is of interest to researchers in all fields of science as well as those specifically interested in the growth and development of nanoscience and nanotechnology. However, this approach falls mainly within the realms of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Such an approach—making nanostructures (having dimensions of typically 2–10nm) atom by atom using carefully controlled chemical reactions—will lead to the generation of cheaper techniques compared with lithographical methods. In nature, self-assembly is often used to make complex structures that are limited to relatively simple systems. Such self-assembly assists with the creation of hierarchical, complex systems that go on to form the base products for further self-assembly steps. Drexler predicted that the bottom-up design of proteins would be used to fabricate complex nanodevices with customized characteristics. Such nanodevices will mimic biological processes and therefore be capable of specialized functions, self-replication, and self-destruction.\nSome other nanostructures made in nature are employed in nanofabrication, such as naturally and regularly formed nanochannels of zeolites that can be used in water treatment to check water adsorbed by bikitaite (a scarce lithium-containing zeolite), or by using well-ordered zeolite channels for the synthesis of new materials like porous carbon. Perhaps in recent years the most publicized material is the carbon nanotube (CNT). In 1991S. Iijima discovered\nthe molecular structures of carbon nanotubes to be long, thin cylindrical tubes of carbon. The bottom-up approach was used for the fabrication of CNTs and quantum dots—crystals which contain only a few hundred atoms and upon excitation emit different wavelengths of light, depending on their size. Quantum dots can therefore be used to tag proteins and nucleic acids. They also fluoresce when illuminated with ultraviolet light and so can be used to locate attached proteins.\nLithography is writing or drawing on yellow, salty limestone so as permit ink impressions to be taken. The Greek word “lithos” is derived from the word stone according to the Oxford Dictionary. Lithographic techniques are vastly important for microfabrication and nanofabrication. Recently, there are challenges to improve and develop new lithographic methods with enhanced resolution, due to various limitations of photolithographic processes in the smaller characteristics and features.\nOf course, one recent development in the field is dip-pen nanolithography (DPN)—an AFM scanning probe nanopatterning technique utilized to deliver molecules to a surface using a solvent meniscus that naturally forms in the ambient atmosphere. This is a direct-write technique which gives highresolution patterning abilities to a number of molecular and biomolecular “inks” on diverse substrates, including semiconductors, metals, and monolayer functionalized surfaces. The ability to offer the precise alignment of multiple patterns offers an additional advantage to using AFM tips to write and read nanoscopic features on surfaces. Because of this, DPN has been used as a valuable tool for studying basic issues in surface science, colloid chemistry, and nanotechnology. For example, the organization and crystallization of particles on a chemical or biomolecular template, the monolayer etching resists of semiconductors, nanoscale tethered polymer structures, and diffusion and capillarity on surfaces at the nanolevel can all be examined by using this technique.\nThe requirement to build stable nanostructures means that it is very beneficial to use molecules that can anchor themselves to a substrate by electrostatic or chemisorption interactions. The preparation of nanostructures using the DPN technique is a single-step process that does not need the use of resists. Because of nanotechnological applications, it is very significant to pattern and design molecules in high resolution, and also to functionalize surfaces with various patterns of two or more components (Fig. 1.7) [18].\nFig. 1.8 shows the basic concept of nanomanufacturing. Individual atoms given in the periodic table form the basis of nanomanufacturing [40, 41]. These can be assembled into molecules with diverse structures by using different methods including directed self-assembly and templating, and can be suitably positioned according to requirements. In the future, device architectures, integration, and in situ processing may be employed, culminating in nanosystems, molecular devices, etc."

      "heading" : "1.4.3 Some Key Inventions and Discoveries",
      "text" : "Nanotechnology in 1985 received its largest push with the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by Binnig and Rohrer [42], scientists at IBM’s Z€urich Research Laboratory, some 41years after Feynman’s predictions. The STM was utilized to build nanoscale atomic features by a team of IBM scientists. One example was spelling out “IBM” using xenon atoms on a nickel surface [43] (Fig. 1.9). Thus nanowriting as predicted by Feynman\nbecame a reality. While this was exciting, it should be mentioned that the experiment was carried out under attentively controlled conditions (e.g., in a vacuum and with liquid helium cooling), taking near to 24h to obtain the letters “IBM.” Moreover, the atoms did not bond to the surface, instead they were simply adsorbed. This meant that with a small change in pressure or temperature they would have been dislodged. To make advances into the realm of atom-sized devices, it is essential to survey the landscape at that tiny scale (the atomic landscape). An STM allows the imaging of solid surfaces providing atomic-scale resolution [44]. It works based on a tunneling current, which begins to flow when a sharp tip is mounted on a piezoelectric scanner that is offered to a conducting surface at a distance of approximately 1nm (1 F). In fact, resolution on the scale of individual atoms comprising a surface can be displayed using an STM.\nSubsequent to the invention of the STM was the rapid extension of a family of related STM techniques—categorized as scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques. Of all the other technologies available at that time, the most important was certainly the atomic force microscope (AFM), invented in 1986 [45]. Using a customary AFM, the DPN technique has been reported to produce ultra high-resolution features with line widths having a spatial resolution of about 5nm. Fig. 1.10 shows two typical AFMs used in the laboratories at UIC [41]. AFMs provide the possibility of studying nonconducting surfaces; due to its “atomic” tip it can scan van der Waals forces. An AFM is composed of a thin cantilevered sharp (about 1–10nm (F) radius) probing tip, a 3D piezoelectric scanner, and an optical system in order to measure the deflection of the cantilevered tip. When the tip is brought into contact with, or tapped on, the surface, or positioned in its proximity, it is affected by a combination of surface forces (both attractive and repulsive). These forces cause bending and torsion in the cantilever, which is continuously measured via the deflection of a reflected laser beam. A 3D scanner moves the sample or, in alternative designs, moves the cantilever in three dimensions, thereby scanning a predetermined surface area. The vertical resolution of this tool is extremely high, reaching 0.01nm (F)—the order of an atomic radius. In the first decade of the 20th century, primary observations and size measurements of NPs were possible. Such observations were mostly related to\nZsigmondy who published a book in 1914 and made detailed studies of gold sols and other nanobiomaterials at sub-10-nm sizes. Furthermore, he used an ultramicroscope which employed a dark-field technique for seeing particles at sizes much less than the wavelengths of visible light.\nApplications began in the 1980s with the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope and the discovery of carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. In 2000, the US government founded the National Nanotechnology Initiative to direct nanotechnological development. Traditional techniques were developed during the 20th century in the fields of interface and colloid science for characterizing nanobiomaterials. These were widely used for the first generation of passive nanobiomaterials [18]. One of the saturated hydrocarbons is diamondoid molecules, which has diamond-like fused ring structures and can be extremely used in nanotechnology"

Fullerene and its derivatives have enormous potential in materials science owing to their unique physical and chemical properties. Although fullerene was discovery in 1985 by Kroto et al., its preparation process is still not yet fully understood. There are several theories for the formation of fullerene derivatives, such as fullerenes C60 and C70; laser evaporation of graphite was used by Kroto and colleagues. They were discovered Cn clusters (n 20) of which the most usual were found to be C60.\nIn 1985, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Kroto Curl and Smalley for their discovery of fullerenes [46]. Thereafter, other desired fullerenes, such as C76, C80, C240, etc., were synthesized from large numbers of carbon atoms. Since their discovery nearly three decades ago, an enormous number of research articles have considered the nanoheterostructures of fullerenes. Several efficient and less costly methods for producing fullerene nanoheterostructures have been developed [47, 48]. C60 and its derivatives have tremendous potential in materials science due to their unique physicochemical properties [49]. Lately, C60-based nanostructures, including nanotubes, nanorods, and nanosheets have attracted unique attention in the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology [50].

CNTs can be fabricated by vaporizing carbon graphite in an electric-arc evaporation reactor below an inert atmosphere during the synthesis of fullerenes [52].\nAs previously mentioned, bottom-up methods are also used for the fabrication of CNTs. They can be used for investigations of physics in 1D solids and also in different nanoscale devices [53]. Furthermore, they can be self-assembled to hierarchical structures as well as having their orientations controlled [54]. CNTs are comprised of a complete network of hexagonal graphite (Fig. 1.11) forming a graphene cylindrical tube. The diameters of nanotubes range from one nanometer to several nanometers. Their diameters are much smaller than their lengths which range from one micrometer to several. Synthesis techniques have since been developed to create and purify carbon nanotubes as well as tailor their characteristics and functionalities. Laser ablation, chemical vapor deposition, and metal-catalyzed disproportionation can be combined to generate carbon nanotubes [55]. Single-walled carbon nanotubes have various presentday and future applications."

As previously mentioned, after the discovery of carbon nanotubes, further research into various carbon morphologies was conducted, resulting in a number of recently discovered nanostructured carbon allotropes.\nGraphene was first investigated at the theoretical level in the 1940s, however, it was not practically pursued until the 1970s [59]. It is constructed of single planar layer of carbon atoms consisting sp2-hybridized bonded carbon which tightly packed into a 2D hexagonal lattice. Important work on graphene was conducted by Geim and Novoselov in 2004 [60], who in 2010 gained the Nobel Prize in Physics for their investigations. Graphene is a new class of 2D nanostructure that is an allotrope of carbon, one atom thick, comprising a hexagonal lattice (Fig. 1.11). One carbon atom is positioned at each of its hexagonal vertices, making it flexible, very strong, transparent, and electrically conductive. Its electrical conductivity is reported to be six orders of magnitude greater than that of copper and its thermal conductivity is also high. Relativistic quantum phenomena have been investigated, owing to its electron transport, using a Dirac-like equation in a benchtop experiment. Other nanostructures that are allotropes of carbon include graphenated CNTs [61, 62], double-walled CNTs (DWCNTs) [63], nanobuds [64, 65], graphene nanoplatelets [66, 67], graphene nanoribbons [68–70], nanodiamonds [71], carbon foam [72, 73], and variations of fullerenes (e.g., nano-C20 and nano-C70) [74, 75].\nGraphene’s electronic properties have been investigated over the years. Graphene has received interest from both scientists and the general public due to its unique physical and optoelectronic properties, as well as being considered “the mother of all graphitic carbon allotropes” [76–79]. As seen in Fig. 1.12, 2D graphene may be wrapped, rolled, or stacked to 0D (buckyballs), 1D (carbon nanotubes), or 2D (graphite) dimensionalities [80]. Its electronic properties may be ascribed to its sp2-hybridized bonds, the exceptional quality of its electronic crystals, its extreme aspect ratio and charge carrier mobility, and its extremely efficient extraction properties. In addition, graphene along with graphene oxide (GO) and its reduced form (RGO), has been found to be biocompatible under special conditions and thereby capable of being interfaced with biological molecules [77–79]. Nowadays, research and development on numerous properties of graphene is ongoing and is highlighting novel phenomena. In the field of nanotechnology, graphene stands out as a really unique molecular building block (MBB) [16]."

      "text" : "Over the years, nanotechnology as a field of applied science has grown to cover a large range of technologies. Development of NPs has been significant and they offer a wide range of medical, catalytic, sensor, electronic, environmental, and biological uses [81, 82]. Nowadays, nanomaterials offer different environmental treatments and remediations for contaminated wastewater, air, groundwater, surfaces, and soils [83, 84]. Nanomaterials can provide solutions to technological and environmental challenges in the areas of catalysis, medicine, solar energy conversion, and water treatment [85]. One example of an application of nanotechnology is the remediation of contaminated groundwater using NPs containing zero-valent iron—a rapidly emerging technology with notable potential benefits [83, 86]. Moreover, nanofilters can be applied to automobile exhausts and factory smokestacks and nanosensors can be developed to detect toxic gas leaks at very low concentrations [14].\nNowadays, metal and metal oxide NPs are widely explored due to their unique properties and capabilities in various fields. The first person to recognize the existence of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) was Michael Faraday in 1857. Afterward, in 1908, Gustav Mie gave a quantitative description of MNP color.\nMNPs have sizes between those of molecules and metallic structures. This means that they possess specific electronic characteristics including local density of states, quantum confinement, plasmon excitation, increased numbers of kinks, short-range ordering, having a vast number of low-coordination sites (e.g., corners and edges), and dangling bonds. Consequently, they possess\nunique properties and high potential to store excess electrons. Among all MNPs, gold and silver NPs have showed significant potential in the fields of agriculture, energy, and medicine [87–89]. In medicine they are used for drug delivery and therapeutic applications, and they have biomedical potential in vitro [90, 91]. Moreover, MNPs have catalytic activity being significantly used in photocatalysis and as nanocatalysts. MNPs can be utilized in the process of effluent treatment in order to reduce microbial loads. Silver NPs play a significant role in antimicrobial, antifungal, and antibiotic applications in human health care [92, 93] and have been used in water purification, wound care, bone prostheses, and reconstructive orthopedic surgery, along with having applications linked to cardiac devices, catheters, and surgical appliances.\nConsidering the existence of a diversity range of metals, researchers are able to form diverse metal oxide NPs (metal ONPs), such as ZrO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZnO, CeO2, TiO2, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, etc. Generally, metal oxides possess a wide number of structural geometries and varied electronic structures having characteristics of metals, semiconductors, or insulators. Metal oxide NPs illustrate unique and completely new physical and chemical properties owning to their limited size and their high density of corner or edge surface sites. During the past two decades, research and development of the synthesis and applications of different titanium dioxide NPs has become tremendous [94, 95]. Most of the applications of nanostructured TiO2 are closely associated to its optical properties. Applications of nanostructured TiO2 include sensor technologies, hydrogen production and storage, rechargeable batteries, dye-sensitized solar cells, self-cleaning materials, cancer treatments, electrocatalysis, photocatalytic removal of various pollutants, antibacterial applications, and also the production of TiO2-based nanoclays."

      "text" : "The discovery of carbon nanomaterials, such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene, has opened a new section in carbon chemistry. Magnetic and superconducting fullerides, chemically bonded fullerene complexes, nanometer-scale helical carbon nanotubes, and atoms trapped inside a fullerene cage are a few of the areas which have generated much excitement. There are various potential applications for carbon nanotubes owning to their extraordinary properties, such as their small size and mass, high electrical conductivity, high strength, thermal conductivity, etc. These extraordinary properties [96–99] mean that CNTs have potential in numerous mechanical, electronic, thermal, chemical, and biological applications. Ever since the discovery of CNTs, researchers have been studying their potential in possible applications including nanoelectronics [100–104] and catalysis, as well as in other fields like bioapplications [105–114].\nCNTs are polymers of pure carbon and owning to their enormously rich carbon chemistry can be reacted and manipulated. Also, they offer structural variation and the possibility to optimize solubility and dispersion. CNTs have\nvery desirable physicochemical properties that can be used in the environmental, commercial, and medical sectors. The electrical properties of singlewalled CNTs are highly sensitive to surface charge transfers and changes in the surrounding environment since their walls are comprised of an atomic monolayer. Due to their surface sensitivity, surface charge mechanisms can cause covalent/noncovalent interactions and van der Waals forces to induce significant changes in their electronic properties and local density of states.\nCNTs have high adsorption efficiency and the capability of removing heavy metals like lead (Pb) [115]. One example of this is the use of amorphous Al2O3 on a supporting CNT for the removal of fluoride from drinking water [116]."

      "text" : "At the same time engineers and physical scientists have been examining organic and inorganic nanostructures, as noted in previous sections of this chapter, engineers, biological, and medical scientists have been making their own advancements—recognizing other nanostructures as biological molecular building blocks, such as liposomes, cyclodextrins [12], etc. These nanostructures present special applications in drug delivery, biosystems, and targeting.\nMany present-day studies are linked to determining the biocompatibility of nanostructured materials. They have been found to be both nontoxic and cytocompatible. Most of these nanomaterials have new chemical and biological properties and do not occur naturally [117]. The biological assembly of CNTs may be achieved by manipulation, separation, and dispersion. Currently, carbon nanomaterial allotropes are one of the most studied nanomaterials in the scientific community. Among these allotropes are CNTs. They are at the top of the list of synthetic bionanomaterials [118–122] and have enormous popularity due to their unique properties and applications. The utility and versatility of CNTs make them promising candidates in nanomedicine and bionanotechnology. They are considered to be able to improve the performance and quality of many products, including cellular scaffolds, bioelectronics, and biosensors. It should be noted that the development of drug delivery systems [123] and nanoscale biosensors [124] based on CNTs has been driven via experimental evidence where biological species, including enzymes and proteins, are immobilized either on CNT surfaces or in their hollow cavities [125].\nRecently, hopes have been raised regarding the use of CNTs as superior biosensor materials due to the successful fabrication of various electroanalytical nanotube devices, especially those modified using biological molecules [126]. These prototype devices, sometimes prepared as ordered arrays or single-nanotube transistors, have shown efficient electrical communication and promising sensitivities that are required for such applications as antigen recognition [127] enzyme-catalyzed reactions [128], and DNA hybridizations [129]. Recently, CNT/hydroxyapatite composite-coated [130] bioimplants\nhave received much attention for the surface modification of implant materials to promote interactions with living bone tissues. These bioimplants have a similar chemical composition and crystalline structure to natural apatite found in the human skeleton."

      "text" : "Nanotechnology has made enormous progress over the past few decades. In summary, nanotechnology requires the measurement, prediction, and fabrication of matter on the scale of atoms and molecules. It is hoped that atomicscale nanotechnology will have a revolutionary impact on the way we do, design, and produce things in the future. Nanotechnology is an atomic or molecular approach to building physically, chemically, and biologically stable structures one atom, or one molecule, at a time. To date, scientists and researchers can control atoms or molecules individually and can manipulate them as well use them to achieve phenomenal degrees of precision. Nanotechnolgy’s contributions to society may appear small at the moment but with continued manpower and funding it is hoped it will provide results and innovations. If nanotechnology continues to grow at its current rate it will touch the life of nearly everyone on the planet in the next few next years. Results of investigations and developments in nanotechnological fields are entering into all areas of our lives, such as agriculture, aerospace, energy, defense, materials science, environmental science, and medicine. Nanotechnology is developing quickly with its applications being investigated via an increasing number of scientists and clinicians, government agencies, venture capitalists, and politicians. Some active research areas include nanolithography, nanorobotics, nanodevices, nanopowders, nanocomputers, nanoporous materials and nanostructured catalysts, molecular nanotechnology, molecular manufacturing, nanolayers, medicines and nanobiology (e.g., diseases prediction, prevention, and treatment), and some organic nanostructures. Globally, biomedical and clinical scientists are working on disease prevention and early delivery of care. Researchers have known for many years that current technologies depend on processes that take place at the nanoscale. Some instances of these technologies are lithography, ion exchange, adsorption, drug design, catalysis, composites, and plastics."

    "abstractText" : "Nanotechnology is a mindset, even though the scientific community is fascinated with the field of nanoscience, most of the ongoing discussions, definitions, and attention is focused on nanotechnology. As such, it represents a broad term which demonstrates the apotheosis of man’s ceaseless urge for knowledge having practical potential. Themeaning of the term nanotechnology is any technology operating on the nanoscale which has applications in the real world, that is, to employ single atoms andmolecules to form functional structures [1]. The field of nanotechnology involves the creation and utilization of chemical, physical, and biological systems with structural features between single atoms or molecules to submicron dimensions, and also the assimilation of resultant nanostructures into larger systems [2, 3]. The simplest definition of nanotechnology is “technology on the nanoscale.” Subsequently, various definitions of nanotechnology have evolved. This original definition requires further development, such as a definition of what is meant by nanoscale. Thus we cannot properly define nanotechnology unless we define “nanoscale,” that is, a scale covering 1–100nm. A brief definition of nanotechnology is an “atomically precise technology” or “engineering with atomic precision” [4]. Nanotechnology is connected with systems and materials, the components and structures of which represent novel, significantly improved chemical, physical, and biological properties, processes, and phenomena because of their nanoscale size. The dictionary definition of nanotechnology is “the design, characterization, manufacture and shape and size-controlled application of matters in the nanoscale” [5]. A substitute definition from the same dictionary is “the careful and controlled manipulation, precision placement, modeling, measurement, and production of materials at the nanoscale in order to make matters, systems, and devices by fundamentally novel properties and functions” [5].Nanotechnology is a branch of knowledge, within a subclassification of technology in colloidal science, chemistry, physics, biology, and other scientific fields, encompassing the study of phenomena at the nanoscale [6].",
